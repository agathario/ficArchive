      When Agatha signs on to do a long-awaited sequel to one of her beloved movies, she thinks it'll be an easy check and a chance to reminisce on her youth. Little does she realize her past has come back to bite her in the ass, primarily in the form of one Rio Vidal.

<p>
<span>
      Agatha was hung over. Just a little bit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Maybe she’d had too much to drink last night and maybe she’d made things even harder for herself by taking someone home. Kicking someone out was only fun if there wasn’t a splitting headache while she did it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Either way, hungover or not, Agatha was sure she’d find Billy’s voice just as grating.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you excited? This is your first day for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos 2
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      ! Do you think it’ll be hard to get back into character after all these years? I loved the original movie as a kid. I mean, I still love it now, but–”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t even need to look to know Billy was looking at her with that same, kicked puppy look. Sinking further into the leather seat, she adjusted her sunglasses and cradled her coffee to her chest. She was getting too old to be drinking the way she did last night, but it’d been a celebration. Nothing like getting wasted to kick off a sequel that took nearly twenty years to make happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not that she’d ever admit it out loud, but Agatha had a soft spot for
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . It was her breakout role after a few smaller roles in college, solidifying her place in Hollywood as more than just her mother’s daughter. It had been a good distraction too, keeping her busy when all her mind wanted to do was think about something else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you excited to see Lilia and Jen again?” Billy asked, clearly not understanding the need for quiet. He was such a goody two shoes. Agatha doubted he would ever have a drop of alcohol before he was legal. “When was the last time you all worked together?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A TV show a few years ago,” Agatha said. Maybe if she answered him then he’d shut up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you ever wish you got to work with them more?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Apparently she wasn’t going to get any peace and quiet any time soon.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Agatha said. If Billy was going to keep talking like this, he was only getting the bare minimum from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t have many friends in the business. She’d made it a point to keep everyone at an arm’s distance, and while she wouldn’t really call Jen or Lilia a friend, they weren’t strangers either. Another thing she would never admit out loud was that she was actually looking forward to working with them again. They really weren’t anything more than coworkers, but Agatha knew both women took their work seriously, talented actresses in their own right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the driver finally pulled up to the studio’s building, Agatha couldn’t help but feel relieved that today was more of a meeting than anything else. She couldn’t act to save her life right now. With a stifled groan, Agatha dragged herself out of her car and headed inside, Billy trailing after her still talking. One day she was going to tape that boy’s mouth shut.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The meeting today was taking place in a small conference room, long tables creating a large rectangle where everyone would be facing inwards. Agatha rolled her eyes. Great, now everyone would get prime angles to see just how shitty her hangover was. She circled the room, finding her name towards the center and front of the room, next to Lilia and a placard that simply read
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Director
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her brows. That was one thing Agatha didn’t understand about this production, the secrecy behind the director. Her agent had been strangely skittish every time Agatha mentioned this, and even her mother had been evasive about the fact, which was even more suspicious considering she was an executive producer for the film.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t have much of a say,” Evanora had told her, looking faintly disgusted. “The studio wanted this director and this director alone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This only made Agatha all the more curious yet wary. The studio wanting this specific director so badly that they went against her mother said a lot about the director’s talent. Evanora disliking the director also said a lot, but Agatha wasn’t sure exactly what it said just yet. For all Agatha knew, Evanora just thought this director had looked at her wrong at an event, or maybe, this director went against all of her mother’s delicate sensibilities.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had been slumped in her chair for about ten minutes when Jen arrived with a haughty jut of her chin. In response, Agatha wiggled her fingers in a sarcastic hello. Jen predictably rolled her eyes at her and sat one seat away from her, on the other side of Lilia’s chair. She was dressed impeccably as always, gold jewelry glinting even in the dim lighting of the room and dressed without a single crease. A stark difference to Agatha’s jeans and wrinkled button-down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two of them lasted a whole five minutes in silence before Agatha asked, “Hey, do you know who this hotshot director is supposed to be?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, thank you so much for asking how I am, Agatha,” Jen said, making Agatha scoff. “It’s been, what? Five years? It means a lot for you to ask.” Then, as if she just processed what Agatha asked, she stared at her in bewilderment. “Wait, you don’t know?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha paused, studying Jen’s face. She looked genuinely surprised, and that only worsened the sinking feeling in her stomach. “You do.” It was a statement, not a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah,” Jen nodded slowly. “I found out weeks ago.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What did you find out about weeks ago?” Lilia asked, sliding into her seat between them. Her curls were piled up high on her head, and her clothes were her usual hippie affair. Agatha barely held back a snort.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why can’t either of you have manners?” Jen huffed, but when Lilia just stared at her, she gave in quickly. “The director,” Jen explained. “Agatha doesn’t know who it is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia raised an eyebrow. “You don’t?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We wouldn’t be having this conversation if I did,” Agatha snapped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s odd,” Lilia said, studying Agatha in a way that made her want to squirm. Instead, she settled for fidgeting with her now empty coffee cup. “She’s the reason I signed on to the project,” Lilia continued thoughtfully. “I thought she’d do right by the aesthetics and intentions of the first film.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She,” Agatha repeated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Both Jen and Lilia gave her a look at this. “Of course,” Jen said, seemingly torn between concern and annoyance. “Do you really think we’d want to do this movie if it wasn’t directed by another woman?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave a small shrug. She’d signed on without knowing that fact. When it came down to it, nostalgia aside, the sequel seemed like easy money, and when both her agent and mother insisted she do it, Agatha agreed without a second thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, here she is,” Jen said. “Your mystery director.” This was followed by a quiet hum of approval. “She’s even hotter in person.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, but when she looked up, she realized exactly why she was never told who the director would be. She never would’ve fucking signed on otherwise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Standing in the doorway, Rio Vidal smiled at her. “Hello, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Because who in their right mind would want to work with their fucking ex?

      Rio finds herself intrigued by the girl in her math class, who is none other than Agatha Harkness.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Rio didn’t really see the point in college, but she had to admit, this patch of grass by the library was the perfect place to lay in the sun when you had nothing better to do. Or well, when you were avoiding everything you should be doing. Rio had three different homework assignments she should be doing right now, but why do that when it was such a beautiful day?
    </p>
<p>
     Half-asleep, Rio startled when a backpack was suddenly dropped beside her. She blinked blearily at the figure above her before offering a lazy grin. “Hey, Alice,” she greeted her roommate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you have class right now?” Alice replied pointedly as she sat down next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio checked her watch and sighed. Yeah, she did have class, but there was no way she was getting up to go to some accounting class. It must’ve been all over her face too because Alice shook her head, saying, “I don’t see why you don’t just switch majors.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because daddy dearest is paying, and he wants me to do business,” Rio replied. Even though they’d only been roommates for a few months, this was a conversation they’d had several times already. It was almost as sweet as it was annoying, Alice’s inability to comprehend Rio’s predicament. “Photography and filmmaking are just silly little hobbies to him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what? You’re just going to be miserable for four years?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not miserable.” She really wasn’t. Rio was good with numbers, always had been. It was just kind of boring, but she was used to boring. Rio sat up and snatched the paper Alice was holding. “What’s this?” she asked. She skimmed over the paper with mild curiosity. “An open mic?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thought I could play my guitar,” Alice shrugged, but she wasn’t making eye contact, meaning she was being all self-conscious.
    </p>
<p>
     Sighing, Rio said, “I’ll come with. I have nothing better to do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your homework?” Alice suggested, to which Rio just laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them stayed out there for another hour with Alice working on an essay and Rio weaving together flowers into a crown. As her fingers worked, more muscle memory than anything else, Rio watched all of the other students walking to and from classes. It was always interesting to see all the different kinds of people on campus.
    </p>
<p>
     One girl caught her eye though.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, do you know who that is?” Rio asked, nudging Alice. “Everyone’s staring at her.”
    </p>
<p>
     It didn’t just happen while the girl was walking either. Rio was pretty sure the girl was in her college algebra class, and every time, people stared at her like she was on display. At the same time though, no one sat anywhere near her, leaving a neat little circle of chairs empty around her. It never made much sense to Rio how a pretty girl with blue eyes like her didn’t have people flocking to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you been living under a rock?” Alice replied in disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flashed an irritated grin. “Yes, I picked out a shiny one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s Evanora Harkness’s daughter,” Alice said, as if that explained everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why does that name sound familiar?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god,” Alice shook her head. “You really have been living under a rock.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes and resisted the urge to tear Alice’s essay in half. Instead, she delivered a sharp kick to her thigh. “Are you gonna explain or leave me in suspense?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Evanora Harkness, as in
     <em>
      the
     </em>
     Evanora Harkness,” Alice told her. “She’s a really famous actress.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head, and after a moment, she nodded. “Oh, her,” she said blandly. Rio knew exactly who Alice was talking about now. Evanora Harkness was a household name, but Rio tended to block out any news on her. She found the woman’s acting over the top and false, which felt ridiculous since it was acting. There was something distinctly insincere in her roles though, something that gnawed at Rio and made it impossible for her to enjoy her films. “And that’s her daughter?” Rio said, eyes flicking back to the girl. She didn’t look much like her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Alice nodded. “She’s our age, I think. Obviously here for the acting program.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed but let the subject drop. She didn’t think much of Agatha Harkness again until later that week when she went to her college algebra class. Just like every class before, Agatha sat in the center of the seats with no one around her.
    </p>
<p>
     Now that she knew who she was, Rio understood the condescending haughtiness the other girl seemed to exude, and she couldn’t help but smile at it. She knew girls like Agatha Harkness after years in private school. Well, years of getting kicked out of private schools.
    </p>
<p>
     Acting as natural as possible, Rio took a seat in the row behind Agatha, breaking the unspoken bubble. She could feel everyone else staring at her like she’d just signed her death certificate, and when Agatha turned around to glare at her, she understood why. It didn’t deter her though, and Rio merely smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “This seat’s not taken, right?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked like she wanted to say it was, but eventually, she shook her head and turned back around.
    </p>
<p>
     Throughout class, Agatha didn’t turn to look at her again, but Rio didn’t look away from her once. Or rather, she didn’t look away from Agatha’s notebook. Even though she was following the professor, she clearly had no idea what she was doing, and her notes were a war zone of numbers and letters. By the time the professor passed out a worksheet of independent problems to do towards the end of class, Rio couldn’t help but lean forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you’ve forgotten to distribute the three to everything in your parentheses,” Rio said quietly, just over Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio expected the glare Agatha shot her, and she couldn’t help but smile. It was attractive on her, and it was also much more interesting than that weird, blank look she always wore. “Are you the professor?” Agatha asked her. Her voice was lower than Rio expected, not the high-pitched prissy pitch she associated with girls like Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you the TA?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sneered, “Then mind your business.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio met her eyes for a long moment before she let out a quiet laugh. “Fine,” she shrugged. She shoved her notebook into her backpack and stood up, savoring the chance to look down on the other girl. “But when you finally accept that you need a tutor, let me know, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, Rio strode to the front of the classroom to turn in her work. She watched as the professor checked over her work and answers. He nodded approvingly and told her to have a good day. Rio replied in kind, and when she looked up, she found Agatha still glaring at her, her pencils gripped tightly in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blew her a kiss as she walked out of class.
    </p>
<p>
     It looked like classes were going to be a lot more interesting from now on.

<p>
     It took everything in Agatha not to lunge at Rio as she sauntered into the room and sat down in the chair beside her. Her hands curled around the edge of her seat, but Agatha imagined them around Rio’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you,” Rio whispered to her playfully.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you,” Agatha snapped, trying not to be too loud. More people were starting to file in, and it was bad enough already that Lilia, Jen, and Billy could all probably hear what they were saying.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just smiled and asked, “How long’s it been, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      You know how long
     </em>
     , Agatha wanted to say. It’d been almost twenty-five years since Agatha had last seen Rio, curled up on their couch, wearing Agatha’s shirts, promising her everything. Agatha swallowed, suddenly feeling dizzy at the reappearance of her ex-girlfriend. What the fuck do you even say to that?
    </p>
<p>
     “Not sure,” Agatha finally said.
    </p>
<p>
     A flicker of hurt flashed across Rio’s face, and Agatha drank it in, memorized it. Good. It was the least she deserved. Before she could twist the knife a little deeper, Lilia and Jen were speaking from her other side, introducing themselves to Rio. Agatha leaned back, relieved to get out of speaking to her anymore. Instead, she carefully watched as Rio interacted with the other women.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen was right, unfortunately. Rio was hot, somehow even hotter than she’d been in college. Where she was once gangly, contrarian, and just drifting along, Rio was now clearly confident and sly, working her awkward charm to her benefit. Her hair was shorter now than it’d been in college, more of a medium length than the long hair Agatha remembered braiding so often.
    </p>
<p>
     “What made you decide to do this movie?” It was Billy who asked, because of course it was. He had stars in his eyes, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little pang at the fact that her PA was so clearly taken with Rio. “I loved your short film,
     <em>
      Salem
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, it was a real drag to make,” Rio said dryly, but Lilia and Jen snorted, catching onto her humor. “But I’ve always liked witchy things, and well,

     is a favorite of mine.” Her eyes seemed to burn into the side of Agatha’s face as she said, “I guess I couldn’t pass up the chance to work with the talent.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a deep breath, worried that if she did anything else she’d throw up. She had no idea what Rio’s game was, but saying that about the movie she’d used as an excuse to break up with her was just… cruel. And Rio had never been cruel. Reckless? Callous? Dangerous? Yes, to all of those things, but never cruel and never to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be honest,” Jen spoke up. “I was your favorite witch, right?” Her voice was light, playful, maybe even a little flirty, if Lilia’s disproving look was anything to go by.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t react to it at all though, merely replying, “No, you weren’t.” Then, before Jen could say anything more, Rio turned away, pulling out a notebook and pen. A Montblanc pen, to be exact. The same pen Agatha gifted her all those years ago. It still worked? And more importantly, why the fuck did Rio keep it?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed it off the table before Rio could stop her. She turned it over in her grasp, and sure enough, engraved into it was
     <em>
      With Love, 2001
     </em>
     . When she looked up, Rio was staring at her with an unreadable expression on her face. Gritting her teeth, Agatha threw the pen back onto the table. She crossed her arms over her chest and slumped back into her chair. She could feel others staring at her, but she ignored them, even as she got the unsettling feeling of being transported back in time to her college algebra class. Just like before, Rio had all eyes on them.
    </p>
<p>
     At least this time Agatha wasn’t being graded.
    </p>
<p>
     When the meeting finally began, Agatha’s foul mood only worsened at just how happy everyone was to be there. There was so much cheering and clapping when all Agatha wanted to do was swing a chair at the woman beside her. Not to mention, Rio practically got a standing ovation when she was announced as the director for the movie.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were dismissed nearly three hours later, Agatha wanted nothing more than to find another bottle of wine to lose herself in. She was about to head out with Billy when a hand caught her wrist.
    </p>
<p>
     Biting back a curse or three, Agatha turned to find Rio standing there, almost looking like Billy had this morning, all small, kicked puppy. “Let’s talk, Agatha,” was all Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clenched her jaw but nodded. She waved her hand, “Go wait in the car, Billy. I’ll be out in a minute.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Billy wavered, eyes going between them worriedly. “I can stay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sweet boy. Agatha hoped he’d grow a spine before she ruined him. “Yes, now go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Since there were still others milling about the meeting room, Agatha walked them over to the restroom, and after checking every stall, she locked the door to make sure no one would interrupt them. Rio watched her do all of this, leaning against the sink counter, dressed in a perfectly tailored suit. Fuck her for looking like that when Agatha looked like a barely put together disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasted no time. She strode up to Rio, stopping just a foot away and demanding, “What the fuck are you doing here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A job, Agatha, or do you have a monopoly to that now?” Rio replied. Her voice was nothing more than a drawl, taunting her. Despite herself, Agatha flinched. No one talked to her like that, no one had until Rio and no one had since Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is when it’s my movie,” Agatha managed to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m here to make that movie a reality,” Rio said, like it really was that simple.
    </p>
<p>
     “And that’s it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, shooting her a disbelieving look. She inched closer, relishing in the way Rio stepped back and bumped into the counter. “You just happened to fucking decide to direct a movie that I’m the lead actress in after not speaking to me for over twenty years?”
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio looked uncomfortable. She squirmed in place, and Agatha watched her poke her tongue into her cheek. It was a familiar habit that Agatha recognized immediately. Rio was hiding something, and she did not want to share. Agatha could wait though, and she did. For nearly a minute, they stood there until Rio finally sighed and said quietly, almost to herself, “That wasn’t exactly my choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it fucking was!” Agatha shouted at her. She laughed incredulously at the audacity of the woman in front of her. Again, she was struck by the urge to grab her by the throat or shoulders or anything and– Agatha stopped short. She had no idea what she wanted, but she did know she wanted to be done with this. Taking a deep breath, she shook her head and said, “You know what? Forget it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha–”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said firmly. She kept her eyes firmly on the counter behind Rio, refusing to look at her. She didn’t want to see Rio’s face, her eyes. She was afraid of what she might do if she did. “I don’t care what you have to say. This is a job, my job, and this is your job too. Whatever happened between us…” Agatha forced her eyes up, making sure Rio understood just how serious she was. “That’s in the past, and that’s it. It doesn’t matter anymore, got it? So just… Do your fucking job, and don’t fuck this up for me, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     For a second, Agatha though Rio might argue, but then she merely nodded. “Okay, Agatha,” Rio said. “If that’s what you want.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t matter what I want,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     As she left the restroom, Agatha wanted to enjoy the fact that she’d been the one to walk away from Rio, to have the last word. Instead, all she could feel was the way her heart couldn’t quite calm itself.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck Rio for this.

<p>
     “Do you have a death wish?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put on an exaggerated smile and replied, “Hello to you too. What can I get you today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m serious,” Alice huffed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am too,” Rio said. “My manager says if I get three thumbs-up from customers, he’ll raise my pay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re insufferable,” Alice shook her head. She dug into her backpack to find her wallet and added, “And I want a caramel macchiato.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a mocking salute and rang up the order. After she handed Alice back her change, she got to making her drink. She was the only one on shift, but it was slow. Alice lingered at the counter, watching her and doing a poor job at hiding her worry.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you really going to play dumb?” Alice asked as Rio handed her her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered it for a moment then shrugged, “I’m just having fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you decided the best way to have fun was to mess with Agatha Harkness? Maybe find a way that won’t get you blacklisted before you even get started,” Alice told her. “I’m going to the library to study, so I’ll be back late. Don’t do anything stupid in the meantime.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You mean anything more stupid than I already have?” Rio said with a wry smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smiled back, but she still shook her head as she left.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio honestly wished Alice had stayed a little longer. Glancing around the university’s small coffee shop, there wasn’t much to do. There was one professor grading essays, and a handful of students doing homework. Nothing that needed her. With a sigh, Rio grabbed the book she always kept under the counter for moments like these.
    </p>
<p>
     Hopping onto the back counter, Rio flipped open to where she’d haphazardly left a sticky note. She only made it through a few pages when someone came in, the bell over the door announcing their arrival. Rio looked up, mouth half-open to give the usual welcome spiel, when she realized it was Agatha who’d just walked in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s lips curled into a smile as she slid off the counter and met Agatha at the front counter.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the last month, Rio had stuck to her new seat in algebra, much to Agatha’s ire. For the most part, she minded her business, but every so often, she’d lean over Agatha’s shoulder to correct her on something. It always earned her a glare and a scathing remark, and Rio couldn’t help but memorize all the different ways Agatha seemed to get mad. The way her eyebrows furrowed, the way she bared her teeth, the way her blue eyes seemed to glow. Rio hadn’t been lying when she told Alice she was having fun.
    </p>
<p>
     “What can I get for you?” Rio asked. When Agatha didn’t answer immediately, staring at her, she stuck her sticky note back into her book and tossed it behind her. “Agatha?” Rio prompted when she still hadn’t answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s your name?” Agatha suddenly asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at the sudden question, and she would’ve said something about it if it weren’t for the fact that Agatha looked as taken aback by the question. “Rio,” she answered. “Rio Vidal. Is that all you came in here for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not,” Agatha rolled her eyes. “I didn’t even know you worked here.” Her eyes glanced up at the menu before she half-heartedly said, “Just a black coffee.” It didn’t sound like what she wanted, but Rio decided not to question it. She rang up the order and poured the coffee without comment. Agatha didn’t take the drink though. She was staring at Rio again, like she was a particularly frustrating puzzle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I get you anything else?” Rio asked, not sure what to make of Agatha’s behavior. It wasn’t the snappy anger she was used to eliciting from her. It made Rio wonder how Agatha dealt with getting stared at all the time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips twisted into a frown before she reluctantly asked, “Were you serious about helping me with algebra?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but laugh, a knowing smile on her lips. “Questions fourteen and fifteen on the homework are giving you a hard time, aren’t they?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you know?” Agatha’s jaw had dropped, and Rio snickered at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     “It deals with the same concept you usually screw up in class,” Rio explained, and for some reason, Agatha blushed at this. She normally didn’t get that embarrassed, even when Rio pointed out when she was wrong in class. If anything, she just got annoyed she’d done something wrong. Clearing her throat, Rio asked, “Do you have the homework with you now? I can show you how to do it while we’re slow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to hold this over me for the rest of semester, aren’t you?” Agatha said. She found her notebook quickly and flipped it open on the counter. “That I finally had to cave and ask for help.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We only have a month left,” Rio pointed out. “I think you’ll survive some friendly gloating.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Friendly,” Agatha repeated sourly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Friendly,” Rio repeated back, raising her eyebrows. “Maybe you’re unfamiliar with the term. It’s when you’re pleasant and kind to someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You haven’t been pleasant a day in your life,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Neither have you,” Rio replied. “Now shut up and let me explain this to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     What should have taken ten minutes of explanation ended up taking half an hour because Rio and Agatha couldn’t stop bickering with each other. By the time they finished the two problems, Rio was relieved that was all Agatha had needed help with. The girl was more stubborn than Rio had expected.
    </p>
<p>
     After putting her things away, Agatha stood there awkwardly for a moment. She tucked a long strand of hair behind her ear and ducked her head in a shy manner that didn’t suit her at all. “Thanks,” she mumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Rio replied simply.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a sharp, single nod and turned to go, only to stop with her hand on the door. She looked over her shoulder and bit her lip. Then, she slowly walked back over to the counter. “Why do you do that?” Agatha asked her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do what?” Rio furrowed her brows.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sit by me in class,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wondered if she was imagining the unspoken ending to that sentence. When no one else does. Rio eyed Agatha for a moment then said, “Because I want to.” Agatha’s face remained carefully blank, so Rio added teasingly, “Plus I get a front row seat to someone who really shouldn’t be in algebra.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” Agatha said, but it was missing its usual vitriol. Her cheeks were pink as she said, “I don’t understand why I need a math credit anyways. I’m an actor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like your mother,” Rio said without thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, Agatha’s face did a thing. It twitched, like she wanted to flinch, but she stopped the movement before it could fully form. It was only the smallest movement, one quickly smoothed away before Rio was sure she’d even really seen it, but it was enough to understand Agatha just a little bit better. You didn’t make that kind of face if you got along with your mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you’ll certainly be nicer to look at on the big screen,” Rio said, changing the subject and watching Agatha’s shoulders relax just a fraction. Then, another customer came in, and Agatha had no choice but to step out of the way. “See you around, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded slowly. “See you around, Rio.”

     Chapter Summary

<p>
      What was supposed to be a fun outing with the cast takes a turn for the worst.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
<span>
      Each production was different.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew this. After years in acting, Agatha had been on all sorts of sets, all with different expectations and energies. Some were purely business, cold and to the point, while others were much more relaxed, full of laughter and friendships. Agatha hadn’t known what to expect with the sequel to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , but when Billy informed her they were required to attend some kind of team building event, Agatha knew she was absolutely going to fucking hate this set.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As much as Agatha wanted to say fuck it and not go, it was a studio executive insisting on this inane get together. Namely, it was the studio executive that was putting a lot of faith (and a lot of money) into this movie, so Agatha really couldn’t say no unless she wanted this movie to see an early end.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was how Agatha, Billy in tow, ended up at a mini-golf park.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh, Agatha would strangle this studio executive if she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Along with Agatha and Billy, it looked like the main cast and crew were invited. Lilia and Jen were already there when they arrived, both looking about as excited about this as Agatha did. All three of them had their sunglasses firmly on their faces, partially hiding their scowls. They exchanged stilted small talk until Rio arrived, wearing a blouse with one too many buttons undone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you always show up to things looking that good?” Jen asked, less flirtatious and more sarcastic, sounding much more like the quarrelsome woman Agatha knew. “It’s kind of annoying.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio flashed a grin. “That’s exactly why I do it.” She glanced over her shoulder, and Agatha followed her gaze to where an Asian woman was walking up to join them. Even though her hair was cut differently with bright red highlights, Agatha recognized her with an uneasy jolt. “Everyone, this is Alice Wu-Gulliver. You probably know her mom, Lorna Wu. She’ll be in charge of the soundtrack for our movie.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, I love Lorna’s music,” Lilia said, brightening.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone introduced themselves to Alice, and naturally, the conversation shifted to Lorna and Alice’s music careers. Agatha had always been vaguely aware that Alice had followed her mother’s footsteps, but she’d never kept up. Despite spending a decent amount of time around each other in college, Agatha and Alice had never really been friends.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nonetheless, it was a novelty, having Lorna Wu’s progeny among them, and Billy seemed especially excited by this. Sometimes, Agatha forgot how young her PA was. “That’s a really cool tattoo,” Billy told Alice earnestly. He pointed to the black ink on her arm, one Agatha was sure she’d seen in college. “What does it mean?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, it’s for protection,” Alice explained, glancing down at her arm. Her smile was slightly strained as she said, “My mom insisted on it, actually. I was sixteen when I got it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sixteen,” Billy repeated, awestruck. He glanced around. “Does anyone else have tattoos?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While Agatha, Lilia, and Jen all shook their heads, Rio said, “I have one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, you don’t,” Agatha said without thinking. While only Billy gave her an odd look, Agatha couldn’t help but flush at her carelessness. It’d been over twenty years. Rio very well could have gotten a tattoo since college. It wouldn’t be a stretch at all, and yet… Agatha felt herself frown. And yet it felt wrong not to know that about her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I do,” Rio continued, and Agatha had no idea how long it’d been since she spoke. “I got it for… someone.” She glanced at Agatha before quickly looking away. She cleared her throat. “I hurt her, but she was important to me, so I got one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of what?” Billy asked, but Rio seemed done with the conversation because she curtly said, “Don’t worry about it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While they were called over to get started on their game of mini-golf, Agatha couldn’t help but drag her eyes over Rio, wondering where the tattoo was and what it was of. It had something to do with her; there was no doubt about that. Agatha wanted to see what Rio had gotten to symbolize all they’d been, if only so she could slap her for it afterwards. Getting a tattoo for a relationship Rio had been the one to end was insane, even by her standards. What the hell had she been thinking?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they moved from hole to hole on the golf course, Agatha kept mostly to herself and listened to the conversations around her. Every so often, Lilia or Jen would address her, and she’d answer, but besides that, she honestly spent most of her time watching Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, similar to Agatha, didn’t really speak unless spoken to. Not that it was really a surprise. Even though Rio had been the one to talk to her first, Agatha noticed that Rio didn’t really talk to anyone in college besides Alice. That had made her all the more confusing then. Why single out Agatha, one of the most unapproachable people on campus? To this day, Agatha still didn’t completely understand Rio’s thought process that led to them meeting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I thought this was supposed to be a party,” Rio commented suddenly, and Agatha couldn’t quite hold back a snort. She should have seen this coming. If there was one predictable thing about Rio, it was that she sowed chaos whenever she could. Hearing her, Rio smiled at her before she turned back to the rest of their sad, little group. “Let’s make this a real fight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No hitting,” Agatha said reflexively.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Spoilsport,” Rio huffed, “but that’s not what I meant. I was going to suggest a wager. Whoever wins gets something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Like what?” Billy asked with an excited smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anything they want,” Rio shrugged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Anything is pretty broad,” Jen said warily.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia nodded and added, “Maybe we should agree to something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Instead of the winner getting something, how about the person with the worst score pays for drinks?” Alice suggested. She glanced at Billy and hesitantly said, “Or well, drinks and food?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Boring,” Rio said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice elbowed her. “Then you come up with something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio opened her mouth, and Agatha could tell by the snarl on her face that it would be scathing, but before she could say anything, Evanora’s voice said from behind them, “And what’s all this?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While everyone else startled at the appearance of her mother, Agatha watched Rio’s face shutter into a carefully blank slate. It shouldn’t be surprising. The last time Rio saw Evanora was when she walked in on them in college. That would make things awkward between anyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mother,” Agatha said with forced politeness. “What are you doing here?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m an executive producer, aren’t I?” Evanora replied archly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes. As if her mother had nothing better to do than play mini-golf. She didn’t say this though. It wasn’t worth the inevitable argument it would become. When it became clear that Evanora wasn’t leaving any time soon, Agatha awkwardly introduced her to everyone, but she noticeably hesitated when she got to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio Vidal, a pleasure to meet you,” Evanora said, cutting Agatha off from saying anything more than a stammer. She held her hand out, smiling as if she weren’t boldly lying. “I’m looking forward to working with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t take her hand though. All she did was offer a bland, “You too.” Then, without another word, she turned on her heel and left their group, joining a group of particularly boring-looking producers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Clearly peeved, Evanora laughed harshly and said, “Well, who knew directors could be as dramatic as actors?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone laughed uncomfortably, and the rest of the afternoon continued in a stilted manner. It was nothing like it’d been before, and as Agatha’s eyes lingered on Rio from afar, she couldn’t help but remember another time.
     </span>

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      After they run into each other, Rio and Agatha grow closer.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     After Rio helped her in the coffee shop, Agatha changed in class.
    </p>
<p>
     Whenever Rio corrected her now, Agatha wouldn’t snap at her, furious and two seconds away from biting her head off. Instead, she would just sort of sulk and huff about being wrong again, but she’d do what Rio said, right then and there.
    </p>
<p>
     It was… cute.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was pondering this change as she sat in the crowd for Open Mic. It was Alice’s third one, and Rio had been to all of them. It wasn’t a particularly good time, in the traditional sense that all of the performances were fantastic, but it certainly was entertaining. Rio liked guessing to herself how good someone was going to be, congratulating herself when she was right most of the time.
    </p>
<p>
     After nearly an hour of some truly miserable singing and poetry, Rio got up to get herself a drink. If she was going to survive the rest of this, she was going to need some sugar. A hot chocolate was just what she needed, and once she had it, she headed back to her seat, only to find someone had stolen it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, look who it is,” Rio said into Agatha’s ear, grinning at the way the other girl jumped.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “What are you doing here, with us plebes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Plebes, huh?” Agatha repeated, looking amused. “I wouldn’t go that far, but for your information, it’s for a class.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you performing?” Rio asked curiously. She looked around and stole a chair from a table and pulled it up beside Agatha. Plopping into it, she glanced over her outfit. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, jeans and a t-shirt with a coat that looked like more than Rio’s monthly rent. “Gonna wow us with some dramatic monologue?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted, “No, I’m just here to watch and take notes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “About how bad everyone is?” Rio joked, only to raise an eyebrow when Agatha nodded. She smirked as she leaned over to look at the notebook in Agatha’s lap. “So you’re just here to be a bitch?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that’s all they teach us in acting class,” Agatha said sarcastically. “It’s the first step to being an actor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “God, that explains why you’re all like that then,” Rio said, but she punctuated her words with a sly grin to let Agatha know she was teasing. She didn’t want her to clam up the way she had when Rio mentioned her mom last time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like that?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Got sticks up all your asses,” Rio told her matter-of-factly.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha slapped her arm, Rio laughed. A part of her wanted to grab Agatha’s hand before she pulled away, but Rio didn’t. She tightened her grip around the edge of her chair and tried to keep her smile from getting too big. She was sure Agatha had plenty to say to that, but the brief intermission was over, and suddenly, she was all business.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t have told you what the second half of Open Mic was like, besides Alice, because she was too busy watching Agatha to really pay attention to anything else. The focus on her face as she watched the performances was unlike anything Rio had seen on her face before. Usually, in algebra, Agatha was focused, but it was always tinged by her obvious dislike for the subject. Here, it was clear Agatha was in her element, eyes tracking every little moment, biting her lip in thought.
    </p>
<p>
     The notes she was taking were no joke either. Rio never thought Agatha was a bad student or anything, but she wrote pages upon pages of notes. It seemed kind of mean, considering none of these students were professionals or anything, but Agatha kept writing, like this really meant something.
    </p>
<p>
     When the last performance finally finished (a recitation of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven that nearly put Rio to sleep), Agatha had filled several pages of her sharp handwriting, all sharp angles and cramped letters.
    </p>
<p>
     “A gold star for you,” Rio said to her as she closed her notebook. Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio caught the slight smile on her face. “Headed back to the dorms now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha said. She hesitated, shuffling her feet. “You?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around, and after a moment, she spotted Alice with a bunch of her music major friends. They didn’t always walk back to their room together, but sometimes, they did. It didn’t look like tonight was one of those times though. Shoving her hands into her pockets, Rio said, “Same.”
    </p>
<p>
     In wordless agreement, they left together.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a Wednesday night on campus, so it was pretty empty as they made the walk back to the dorms. Every so often, their arms would brush, and every time, Rio felt herself shiver in a way that had nothing to do with the brisk, winter weather.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re weird,” Agatha announced for no reason.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, a confused smile pulling at her lips. “Am I supposed to say thank you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you take it that way,” Agatha said with a shrug. She eyed Rio from the corner of her eye then elaborated, “You’re different is all. Don’t seem to care much about the fact that I’m Evanora Harkness’s daughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio mulled over her words for a moment then asked, “Should I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Everyone else does,” Agatha huffed. Her shoulders curled in on her, a scowl making its way onto her face. “It’s either the nepotism argument, that I’m actually talentless and got here on my mother’s merit rather than my own.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or I am talented, but I’m so far up my own ass that people don’t even think it’s even worth talking to me for the in.”
    </p>
<p>
     So that was it. That was why Agatha always had such a wide berth around her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t surprised she hadn’t realized this sooner. She rarely spoke to her classmates, and it wasn’t like anyone besides Alice was asking her what Agatha was actually like. She wondered if it was worse for her with people from her major, or if people in general all thought that about her. Also, Rio couldn’t help but wonder how much of either was true. She didn’t think it was all true or anything, but Agatha did seem like a brat sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you don’t try to explain that’s all bullshit?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not worth it,” Agatha dismissed her immediately. “They’ve already made up their minds about me, and nothing I say will change that. Even if I tried, they’d probably accuse me of lying to better my reputation or something.” She shrugged, trying to play it off, but Rio could tell it bothered her. “It’s stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re stupid,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a dark look and said, “I tell you all of that, and that’s what you’re gonna say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio said after a moment. “Because you are.” She bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s, smiling at the genuine surprise that spread across her face. “But you’re not so bad either.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scrutinized her for a moment, probably unsure of what to make of her response, but eventually, she sighed and shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the walk was brief and silent, and when they split up, Agatha to her fancy dorms, she gave Rio that shy look once more, the same one she gave her in the coffee shop. “Thanks, Rio,” she said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, a small puff of air visible in the cold air. “What for?”
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha just smiled and shrugged and walked inside, leaving Rio in the winter night with a warmth in her chest.

<span>
      Sometimes, Billy just hung around. Agatha should probably tell the kid to get a life, but she also didn’t like how quiet her apartment got without him. That was why it wasn’t uncommon on a Saturday morning for Billy to be in her kitchen, cooking them breakfast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      While he did that today, Agatha sat at the table, reading over the script.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were supposed to start filming later this year in the fall, so in the meantime, Agatha was revisiting what felt like another life by digging up everything she still had from
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . It was strange, going back to that time. It wasn’t exactly a time she looked back on fondly, not the lead-up and filming at least.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had always been a bit of a workaholic, but it’d been the worst right after graduating. She’d just gotten dumped by her long-term girlfriend, moved to LA the following week, and started filming the week after. It’d been a hectic time to say the least, and Agatha vaguely recalled a night or two in the hospital when she’d pushed herself too hard.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here you go,” Billy said, pulling her back from her memories. He set a plate of eggs and toast in front of her, along with her coffee with just enough cream to make it tolerable. Billy sat down in front of her with his own breakfast and only made it a few bites before he started talking again. “So, you and Rio,” Billy said, in between forkfuls of eggs. “How do you know each other?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why do you think we know each other?” Agathed tried, but Billy just gave her a disbelieving look. Sighing, Agatha pushed her eggs around. “We know each other from college. That’s it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s it?” Billy snorted. “Agatha, you looked ready to rip her throat out during our first meeting, and at mini golf last month? That stuff about her tattoo? I may be young, but I’m not an idiot.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, you are,” Agatha said without hesitation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy rolled his eyes, undeterred. Great, the kid was getting used to her bullying. That wouldn’t do. “I’m serious, Agatha. Is whatever’s going on between you going to be a problem? Should I, like, body block her any time she tries to talk to you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The mere thought of Billy trying to stop Rio from doing anything made Agatha audibly laugh. She shook her head at Billy’s dismayed look and said, “As sweet and lacking in self-preservation as that is, you can’t exactly stop the director from talking to me, Billy. Besides, it’s not a problem. We knew each other in college, and now we’re working together. No biggie.” When it looked like Billy still wanted to talk about it, Agatha made a shooing motion at him. “Finish eating then clean up. You said there was some art thing you wanted to go to today, didn’t you?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Predictably, this got Billy going, leaving Agatha to enjoy her breakfast in peace. This worked out well. Billy left her alone, but it also got her out. Her agents had insisted that she be more visible to the public in the lead up to the movie in order to build anticipation. That was why Agatha had just had lunch with Jen and Lilia last week. An actress’s job was never done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      An hour later, Agatha begrudgingly went with Billy to some art market at the park near her apartment. It was like taking a dog for its walk, Agatha thought to herself. She’d put on a hat and glasses, keeping the sun from her face and hiding most of her face. For the most part, fans stayed away from her in public. One too many bad interactions with people who couldn’t understand boundaries led to avoidance from everyone, not that Agatha really minded. Still, it didn’t hurt to be safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy flitted from stand to stand, gushing over all of the different art pieces that were on display and for sale.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was the first time Agatha had gone to something like this in a long time. She used to go all the time with Rio in college. It had been one of Rio’s favorite things to do, and she made a point to drag Agatha with her to as many as she could. Rio liked seeing all of the art, partially because she genuinely liked it, partially because she liked making fun of the ugly stuff under her breath to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was so lost in her memories that she thought she was imagining it when Billy suddenly exclaimed, “Rio!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A brittle smile made its way onto Agatha’s face. Of course, it was only a matter of time until they ran into each other. Never mind the fact that Los Angeles had almost four million people in it. While Billy bounced up to Rio, saying something about not expecting to see her here, Agatha took her in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was dressed down, wearing denim shorts and a black t-shirt. Her hair was swept into a messy ponytail, and a pair of dark sunglasses were perched on her face. Agatha felt a wave of irritation pass over her as she realized that Rio was just as annoyingly attractive as she was when they first met.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Find anything good?” Rio asked, and it took Agatha a moment to realize she was talking to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gave a half-shrug and said, “Not really.” A smile pulled at her lips as she recalled another memory. “Nothing as good as what we found in that flea market in Queens.” She wasn’t sure why she shared the memory aloud, but the fond smile Rio gave her in reply quieted any regret she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, I’ll leave you to it,” Rio said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you hanging around?” Agatha blurted out. She tried to ignore the stares both Rio and Billy gave her, a mix of disbelief and suspicion. “It’s just,” she fumbled for a moment. “I don’t know shit about art, and Billy could use someone to talk to about all of this.” She had no idea why she was saying this, offering for Rio to stay. She hated her, Agatha reminded herself. She still hated her so much, but if she was being honest, a part of her had also missed her. There was so much Rio knew about her that no one else did, and Agatha forgot how good it felt to have someone around her like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can’t,” Rio said after a long moment. “I was actually on my way out.” A sad smile flitted across her face for a moment. “Maybe another time, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha swallowed her disappointment and replied loudly, forcing the bravado into her voice, “Yeah, well, you probably just saved me from hearing your pretentious art opinions anyways.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy stared at her, eyes wide, but Rio’s smile just grew.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What a relief for you,” Rio said, and it was impossible to miss the affection in her voice. With a small nod to them, Rio slipped back into the crowds, and both of them watched her until she disappeared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As soon as she was gone, Billy whipped towards her and said, “There’s so much you’re not telling me! What the hell happened with you two?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rolling her eyes, Agatha grabbed Billy’s shoulder and steered him to the next stall. “None of your fucking business, kid. Now, show me the next ugly statue you want to buy.”
     </span>

<p>
     With the start of a new term, Rio couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed that she didn’t have algebra with Agatha anymore. She tried not to openly sulk about it, but about one week into term, Alice had given her a look and simply said, “Get over her or talk to her. It’s getting pathetic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did neither, but it ended up working out anyway because for whatever reason, Rio began to see Agatha a lot more around campus. Sure, she’d catch glimpses of her here and there, but now it felt like Rio couldn’t leave her dorm without seeing her most days. If she didn’t see her walking around, Rio almost certainly saw her while she was working at the coffee shop.
    </p>
<p>
     It was in the coffee shop that Rio got a front row seat to Agatha really playing into her reputation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had walked in with another girl, heads bowed close, seemingly arguing over something. They approached the counter, but neither looked up to order. Rio watched them for a few seconds, and just as she was about to interrupt, the other girl suddenly blew up, shouting, “You sabotaged me!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who? Me?” Agatha said with comically wide eyes. Rio stifled a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     The girl didn’t seem to find it as funny. Her face grew a dark red as she said, “You’re such a lying bitch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha barely batted an eyelash though. She shrugged and smiled, saying, “Takes one to know one.” She leaned in and added in a low voice, “Come on, Laura. It’s just the two of us now.” Her eyes glanced over at Rio. “Well, the two of us and an audience. Still, you can be honest. You weren’t sick yesterday. You were busy screwing your biology professor and lost track of time.” The girl, Laura, stammered, but nothing coherent came out. Her hands raised, as if to stop her, but Agatha wasn’t done. She continued with a cruel laugh, “I mean, that’s one way to learn anatomy, am I right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t prove it,” Laura hissed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha only raised an eyebrow. “Can’t I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Fuming, Laura said nothing else and stormed out of the coffee shop with a petulant flip of her hair. Rio watched her go before saying dryly, “Thanks for the show.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She deserved it,” Agatha said. She watched as Rio rang up her coffee without asking for her order, and as she handed over her card, she said, “You want to ask me something. Ask.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio poked her tongue into her cheek, wondering if she really wanted the answer. Finally, she asked, “Did you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I what?” Agatha replied, but she wore a sly smile that let Rio know she knew exactly what she was talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sabotage her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And if I did?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied Agatha and the way her eyes shone with an almost manic, expectant glee. She was waiting for Rio to fall for this little act of hers. It made Rio roll her eyes instead. “Then I’d ask what she’d done to deserve it,” she said. She poured Agatha her coffee and placed it in front of her. “I mean, besides sleeping with a professor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe I did it just to get the competition out of the way,” Agatha said. Her words came out harsher than before, like if she said them with enough force Rio would believe them. “Ever think of that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re really a bitch, aren’t you?” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     A mix of satisfaction and disappointment crossed Agatha’s face before she forced a laugh. “Well, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     That wasn’t what Rio meant, but she didn’t feel like explaining herself. Instead, she leaned against the counter and changed the subject, saying, “I’ve seen you around more often.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And?” Agatha’s tone was dismissive, but she suddenly couldn’t meet Rio’s eyes. Her hands curled around the coffee, fidgeting with the edge of the lid.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, “I thought it was because our new schedules lined up more than last semester, but it’s because you’re stalking me, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her words got the exact reaction she wanted. Agatha’s head snapped up, cheeks flushing. “As if!” Agatha said. “You’re not important enough for anyone to stalk, let alone me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, because the big bad Agatha Harkness has so many better things to be doing,” Rio mocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, making it clear she didn’t believe her in the least. “My shift ends in ten minutes.” she said. “Wait for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, thrown off by the sudden request. “Why should I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you want to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth then promptly shut it again. She scowled at her before she walked away and sat at one of the empty tables by the door. Rio smiled to herself and went about her usual tasks to clean up before the night shift came in. As she did, she kept one eye on Agatha. She had pulled a notebook from her bag and was scribbling in it, oblivious to the eyes on her. Rio had noticed a while ago that the stares never really went away, even though Agatha had to have been on campus for two years now. Even then though, there was always space between Agatha and everyone else, like she was a star better orbited from afar.
    </p>
<p>
     Hanging up her apron, Rio grabbed her backpack and coat and made her way over to Agatha. “Dinner?” Rio suggested. She nudged Agatha’s foot with her own. “Chinese food?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know any places,” Agatha said, and for the first time since Rio had met her, she sounded unsure of herself. “I don’t–”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know one,” Rio said, feeling uncomfortable to see Agatha so out of sorts. It was just food. “Come on.” She almost grabbed her hand, but she diverted at the last minute. She hooked her hand around her elbow and tugged down one of the sidewalks. There was a Chinese restaurant just off of campus they could go to.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Rio was sure Agatha wasn’t going to walk off, she let go of her and shoved her hands into the pockets of her coat. She wasn’t sure if she was imagining Agatha’s frown when she pulled away, focusing instead on leading them in the right direction. It wasn’t that long of a walk, maybe fifteen minutes, but the cold weather made it feel longer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t mind the cold, but after about five minutes of walking, it became abundantly clear to her that Agatha did. She was doing a pretty good job at hiding how cold she was, but her face was more pinched than usual, and every so often, her body was shivering in a way that was wholly involuntary.
    </p>
<p>
     Smirking, Rio grabbed her beanie from her backpack. It was just a plain black knit one, and without asking, she slipped it on over Agatha’s head. “M’lady,” she said playfully.
    </p>
<p>
     “How dirty is this?” Agatha huffed, but she didn’t move to take it off. She actually tugged it more firmly on her head, smoothing it over her dark strands. It looked adorable on her. It made Rio realize she’d never seen Agatha wear a hat before. Maybe they weren’t stylish enough for her. No matter the occasion, Agatha always looked put together. “Are you going to give me lice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah,” Rio grinned. “A whole bunch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re disgusting,” Agatha told her, but Rio could see the smile curling at her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bumped her shoulder against hers. Bit by bit, she was breaking down those walls. “You say the sweetest things.”

<p>
     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      After a surprise on set, Agatha and Rio come to an agreement.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Agatha’s first day on set was a brisk morning in November. While they were still finishing things up, she’d been asked to come in with a few of the other actors in order to familiarize them and the camera crew with some of the more ambitious shots they’d be attempting once filming officially started.
    </p>
<p>
     While she normally would have been annoyed, Agatha was intrigued more than anything else to know what Rio had in mind. Over the last few months, Agatha had kept her distance from Rio herself while also consuming everything Rio had ever had a hand in. It was a dichotomy that would have been funny if it had been anything other than her ex.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, despite herself, Agatha had to admit the studio was smart to choose Rio as their director. She had such a distinct style that would lend itself to the simultaneous horror and beauty of witchcraft. It would suit the more mature sequel the script had set itself up for, and it would also garner plenty of attention, from fans and critics alike. Especially fans.
    </p>
<p>
     It was impossible for Agatha to miss the almost rabid fan club Rio had while doing her research (definitely not stalking) of Rio. They heavily supported everything she was involved in, and Agatha wasn’t surprised to find that most of them were queer women. Rio had always been open about her sexuality, unlike Agatha who’d waited years before coming out, and it was something she often spoke about in interviews.
    </p>
<p>
     Just another way their paths had diverged, Agatha supposed.
    </p>
<p>
     As she bundled up for the cold, Agatha couldn’t help but feel nervous to see Rio again. They really hadn’t spoken since the summer, apart from some generic emails that everyone on the movie got. Agatha would’ve thought by now that she was used to the idea of seeing her ex around, but Rio had always been a weak spot for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Even then, the last thing Agatha expected when she walked onto set to see not one, but two of her exes, and to make matters worse, they were talking to each other. Agatha practically froze at the edge of the set, watching as Rio nodded along to something Wanda said.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Wanda wasn’t nearly as bad as seeing Rio, Agatha tried to reassure herself. The two of them had starred in a movie years ago, and it had been something of a short but heated affair while filming. Agatha thought of it mostly as an infatuation, supported by the fact that when they finished the movie, the spark fizzled out, and the break-up had been mutual and amicable.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Wanda with Rio though? It dredged up all sorts of emotions that Agatha was sure she would never be able to deal with.
    </p>
<p>
     This was hell. Agatha was sure of it. All that was missing was her mother, and considering she was a control freak who always liked to be on set, it was actually only a matter of time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sure how long she stood there like an idiot until Wanda finally noticed her. “Agatha!” Wanda exclaimed happily. She extended a hand with a bright smile. “I was wondering when you’d show up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda,” Agatha said, forcing a smile onto her face. She grabbed Wanda’s hand as soon as she was close enough and gave it a friendly squeeze. It really was nice to see the other woman, but Agatha couldn’t help but be very aware of Rio’s eyes on her. “What are you doing here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio asked me to stop by, and I happened to have the day off, so here I am,” Wanda explained. “There’s a sequence she has in mind where she needs someone just for a day or two of filming, and I think our fans would love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     There were more pressing issues though. “I didn’t know you two knew each other,” Agatha said, waving between the other two women. Despite her best efforts, her words came out sharper than intended. Wanda didn’t seem to notice, but Rio definitely did. She raised an eyebrow at her but said nothing. “Have you worked together before?”
    </p>
<p>
     Oblivious in a way that almost felt purposeful, Wanda shook her head and said, “Not officially.” Then, she smiled and laid a hand on Rio’s arm. For a brief, insane moment, Agatha thought about tearing her hand off. “We’ve hung out before because we have mutual friends, so we’ve talked about work before.” Wanda shrugged a little, and her hand fell back to her side. “Bounced ideas off each other. That kind of thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really?” Agatha said, but her words were directed at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head with knowing eyes. “Really.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them stared at each other, longer than what was appropriate, and only looked away when Wanda said, “Wow, this isn’t weird at all.” Agatha pressed her lips together while Rio shifted uneasily. Wanda just smirked though and nodded. “I’m going to find Stan to talk about my cameo,” she pointed over her shoulder in a random direction. “Agatha, it was good to see you again. We should catch up sometime.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Agatha agreed half-heartedly. She had a feeling if they ever did, it would include an interrogation on what just happened. She waited until Wanda was gone before she turned back to Rio. Unable to help herself, she hit her arm. “What are you up to?” Agatha hissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “What am I up to?” Rio repeated with a scowl. She pointedly rubbed the spot where Agatha hit her, but she was just being dramatic. Agatha hadn’t even hit her that hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, inviting my ex here!” Agatha said. “Flirting with her!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had the nerve to laugh. “She’s more than just your ex. She’s literally an actress,” she said, “and I wasn’t flirting.”
    </p>
<p>
     The tiny, rational part of Agatha’s brain knew that. Rio had barely even spoken, and even before they’d noticed her, Rio hadn’t seemed particularly touchy. Of course, the rational part of Agatha’s brain was drowned out by the painful twist in her chest at the thought of Rio with anyone else, even when she knew she probably had been with someone else already.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t act stupid,” Agatha told her. “I know how you look when you want someone.” Rio scoffed, but Agatha just kept going, “You should be careful, you know. Rumor has it that she’s dating some professor.” Her lips curled into a sneer. “Maybe you don’t care though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Really, Agatha should have seen it coming. Rio gripped her arm tightly and all but dragged her off set, finding a secluded corner that didn’t have crew running by every two seconds. She shoved her into a wall and stepped close, hand still fisted around the fabric of her shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you need to figure out what you want,” Rio said. Her voice was low and warning, sending a shudder through Agatha’s body.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Agatha scoffed. She tried to push Rio away, not that she tried very hard, but she stayed where she was. Agatha’s jaw clenched. Her hands lingered at Rio’s hips before falling back to her sides.
    </p>
<p>
     “One second you’re telling me we’re just coworkers, that we’re just doing our jobs, then the next, you’re inviting me to hang out with you and look at art,” Rio said. “Today? You’re biting my head off for talking to Wanda, even though you don’t have a right to care about who I talk to. I don’t–” Rio cut herself off, shaking her head. Carefully, she released Agatha from her grasp and stepped back. She took a deep breath and wore a crooked half-smile that looked brittle. “If you want to be just coworkers, we’ll be coworkers, but if you want to be more, if you want to be friends again… You just have to tell me.” Her hand absently smoothed out the wrinkles on Agatha’s shirt, and the touch burned through the fabric. “Enough of this hot and cold though. We’re too old for this.”
    </p>
<p>
     As much as she wished she wasn’t, Rio was right. Even though Agatha hadn’t sorted through her feelings yet, she knew they couldn’t continue like this. At this rate, it would start affecting the production too. Agatha was going to have to be a mature adult about this. The thought almost made her laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha agreed with a sigh. “Let’s just say this set is like Switzerland, okay? A truce. No more hard feelings. We just… act normal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have been acting normal,” Rio pointed out, and Agatha rolled her eyes. “What’s normal for you, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll be civil,” Agatha decided. “Then later, maybe, we can…” She sighed, trying to imagine Rio back in her life. It wasn’t awful, if she was being honest. It was just… Complicated. And messy. And hard. Wasn’t it always sort of like that with Rio though? “Let’s focus on Switzerland,” Agatha said lamely.
    </p>
<p>
     When she met Rio’s gaze again, she was surprised to see a familiar, fond smile on her lips. “Okay, Agatha,” Rio said. “Switzerland.” She raised her eyebrows and wiggled her fingers, tone mocking, but when Agatha hit her arm, she laughed, and everything felt like it would be okay.

<blockquote>
<p>
      In a moment of vulnerability, Agatha talks to Rio.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Rio was sprawled out on Agatha’s bed, pretending to read a textbook.
    </p>
<p>
     Since the night they went to eat Chinese together, the two of them had slowly but surely hung out more and more until Rio practically lived at Agatha’s dorm. It was almost always at Agatha’s when they saw each other because Rio’s room was not only smaller but also had a roommate. Although Alice didn’t really mind when Rio had Agatha over, Rio could tell Agatha was more comfortable when there wasn’t a third party watching them interact.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had gotten used to dropping her walls around Rio, but not really anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     That was what Rio initially chalked it up to when Agatha suddenly announced, “A boy from one of my acting classes asked me out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed her from over her textbook and replied, “What’d you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said quickly. When Rio only hummed, she pouted and asked, “Aren’t you going to ask why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It sounds like you want me to,” Rio said dryly. She flipped a page of her textbook, not having absorbed a single word on the previous page. She flipped another page before Agatha’s stare finally got to her. Rio sighed and shut the textbook completely. “Okay, Agatha, why did you say no?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer immediately, and when Rio craned her neck to look at her, she realized Agatha suddenly looked nervous. She had her hands twisted in the bed comforter as she looked out the window. Rio bit her lip and sat up. She crawled up the bed until she was sitting beside Agatha, their sides pressed together.
    </p>
<p>
     After another minute or two, Agatha finally said quietly, “I don’t like boys, not like that. Well, not at all really, but definitely not like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed, and Rio couldn’t help but smile at the reaction. Agatha saw this and elbowed her. “That’s it?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you want a congratulations? A party?” Rio teased. “I’m a lesbian too, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Somehow,” Agatha drawled, “that doesn’t surprise me at all.” They shared a smile at this, and Rio watched as some of the tension left her. It wasn’t completely gone though, and Rio realized why when Agatha asked, “Have you kissed a girl?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio said. “Haven’t you?” They looked at each other, both wearing sly smiles, and said in unison, “Private Catholic school.” They both chuckled, and Rio wondered what it would have been like to go to high school with Agatha. Would they have been friends then too? Would Agatha have been one of the girls Rio snuck into empty classrooms with late at night?
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio said, bumping her shoulder against Agatha’s. “For telling me.” She eyed Agatha for a moment then added, “I won’t tell anyone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have anyone to tell,” Agatha shot back, but Rio could see the relief clear on her face. “Besides, don’t read too much into it. I just wanted to tell you, so I could tell you more about what a conceited asshole the guy was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, well, go on then,” Rio said with a raised brow. “Spill.”
    </p>
<p>
     So, Agatha did. She launched into a hilarious story about this poor boy who honestly thought he’d have a chance with her. Even if Agatha had been interested in men, Rio doubted it would ever be someone like that. The boy sounded arrogant and stupid, used to the world bending to his will. Someone should have told him that it was Agatha that others bent their will to.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, beautiful, complicated, and mean. Rio didn’t think she’d ever met someone like her before, and she doubted she’d ever meet someone like her again.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re staring,” Agatha said, pulling Rio from her thoughts. Her smile was teasing as she said, “Finally realize how devastatingly attractive I am?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I always knew that,” Rio replied, delighting in how Agatha’s mouth snapped shut. She bit her lip. She really wanted to kiss her, seeing her like this. So, she asked, “Would you let me kiss you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, to her credit, didn’t look surprised. She merely smiled, tilting her head. “I guess that would depend,” she said lightly. She was teasing her, and Rio loved it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Depend on what?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you want to kiss me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I like you,” Rio said with a shrug. Agatha made a face, as if that was a bad answer, and Rio laughed. She shoved her shoulder, letting her hand linger on her. “Oh, come on,” Rio said. “Do you have to make everything so difficult?”
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of answering, Agatha cupped her face and kissed her. As soon as their lips met, Rio felt herself melt into the kiss. This was something she’d been dreaming about for months. Probably from the moment they met. Rio hadn’t really thought it would ever actually happen though. Not like this either. Intimate, on her bed. Safe, pulled close.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let Agatha push her down onto her bed, groaning as Agatha slotted herself between her legs. “You can’t tell anyone,” Agatha told her. She whispered the words against her lips then left open-mouthed kisses along her jaw and down her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever,” Rio mumbled. Her nails dug into Agatha’s back as she arched into her touch. “Just let me kiss you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed against her neck and moved back to her lips, and when they kissed again, Rio couldn’t imagine anything better.

<div>
<p>
     True to their words, Agatha and Rio were nothing but civil as they began filming, and slowly but surely, things got less and less awkward between them.
    </p>
<p>
     It helped that it was obvious they respected each other for their work.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Agatha already assumed so, she was still pleasantly surprised to discover just how good of a director Rio was. It was clear that she had a specific vision in mind as they filmed, but she was never rude. If anything, she was patient when she asked them to run through a scene again and again, directing them to change a small, different thing each time. Her tone may have been curt, but it always seemed to stem from the fact of just how focused Rio was while she worked.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a vast difference from the Rio that Agatha fondly remembered from college, one who’d been eager to create but lacked the direction or confidence to do something about it. Still, there were moments when the Rio that Agatha knew would come through, like when she teased the actors with that droll tone or when she got excited when an assistant brought her snack. It was strange but endearing to see her like this, same and different all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two seem to be getting along now,” Billy said as Agatha got her make-up done one day. “Any chance you’ll tell me what happened now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s only response was a snort.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on,” Billy said in a wheedling tone. “What happened in college?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Agatha, what happened in college?”
    </p>
<p>
     Both Agatha and Billy startled, not noticing Rio enter the make-up trailer. While Billy immediately started stammering an excuse, Agatha merely glanced at Rio to gauge her mood. Rio looked tired today. She was always dressed casually, but she was especially so today in sweatpants and a gray t-shirt that looked vaguely familiar. It had their college’s logo on it. Her hair was braided back, and the real tell was that Rio was wearing her glasses. She’d always hated them in college, and she’d only ever worn them at home or during finals.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” The question left Agatha’s lips without permission. She clamped her mouth shut, but it was too late. She could feel Billy and the make-up artist looking at her curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio seemed to know what Agatha was really asking though because she just shrugged and said, “Late night.” She moved around to lean against the make-up counter. She held two cups of coffee in her hand, one of which she held out to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     After a moment of hesitation, Agatha took it and drank a sip. It had a pump of mocha, just as she always favored but never ordered herself. Agatha’s hand tightened around the cup as she smiled her thanks. Rio merely inclined her head and drank her own coffee. “Billy just wanted to know what we were like in college,” Agatha told Rio, keeping her voice light.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mm, is that so?” Rio hummed. “Well, we were younger and stupider.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Speak for yourself,” Agatha said, and Rio huffed a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     While Agatha finished getting ready, Rio entertained Billy with harmless stories of the accounting classes she took in college. It was hard to imagine Rio in those classes now, after seeing her work as a director. Agatha was glad that Rio got to pursue her passions. The world would was better off with her creative work in it. Agatha felt herself flush at the sentimental thought.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha was done and dressed, it was time to shoot. It wasn’t the most intense scene in the movie, but it was definitely still emotional. Her character was trying to deal with a disaster brought on by a young witch.
    </p>
<p>
     However, after two takes, Rio sidled up beside her and said, “You’re playing it wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     This was the first time they’d disagreed on Agatha’s acting choices. It made her narrow her eyes and reply, “How is it wrong?” She waved a hand at the younger actress and said, “I’m mad that I have to deal with her, right? I have to clean up her mess, even though I swore off magic all those years ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s more than that,” Rio argued. Her voice was even, but Agatha could see the way her eyes were alight with excitement. She was in her element, and Agatha found herself drawn in by the magnetism of a woman confident in her work. “You’re mad at this girl because you see yourself in her,” Rio explained. “A girl who’s afraid and wants to run instead of facing her mistakes, but you know what happens when you run, and you’re tired of running. Specifically, you’re tired of running from who you really are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Tired of running from who you really are. Agatha was well-acquainted with that feeling. Hearing that from Rio of all people brought Agatha back to early in her career, back when she hadn’t been out yet. Under her mother’s watchful eye, Agatha had done movie after movie, dodging questions about her love life and avoiding set-ups from her mother. It’d been almost a decade into her career when Agatha had finally come out, but only because she’d felt secure enough in her stardom and financial stability, safe enough from her mother, to do so. It’d been working with another closeted actress, one so young and new to everything, that’d pushed her to do it.
    </p>
<p>
     All of these thoughts were running through Agatha’s head when Rio suddenly called out, “Let’s take a break. We’ll pick back up in fifteen.” Agatha blinked a few times then looked at her questioningly. Rio, avoiding her gaze, shrugged and said, “You looked like you might need a moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Agatha said, having no idea what she actually wanted to say. She was sure Rio had seen the press when Agatha finally came out, but some part of her also wanted Rio to know the whole story behind it. This wasn’t the place or time for that though. So instead, Agatha merely smiled weakly and said, “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asked, echoing the same question Agatha had just asked her earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Memories,” was all Agatha could think to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head, studying her for a moment. “Good ones?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes and no,” Agatha said. The desire to tell her was strong, just on the tip of her tongue, and it amazed her the way she wanted to tell Rio everything like nothing had changed. It’d always been that way though. Rio had always been someone Agatha was unafraid to talk to, but that had always been because Rio had never seemed to have any expectations from her, unlike everyone else. Did she have them now?
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I ever tell you about the first time someone tried to ask me out after I became a director?” Rio asked suddenly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her, baffled by the lack of segue. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was after I made
     <em>
      The Witches’ Road
     </em>
     ,” Rio said casually, but the way she watched Agatha from the corner of her eye made it clear she was anything but. She tucked her hands into her pockets and started rocking back on her heels, and that was when Agatha knew for sure that she was nervous. It was the same thing Rio had done before she told Agatha she loved her for the first time. “I was at some event. I don’t even remember which one now. I was talking to some of the actors though, and just, out of nowhere, one of them asked if I wanted to go on a date sometime.” Rio smiled mischievously as she continued, “He was very nice but not exactly my type.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, finally understanding what she was doing. “You don’t say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, I had two options,” Rio said. “Politely turn him down with some fake excuse or I tell him exactly why that would never be happening.” She finally settled onto her heels, keeping still. “I came out to all of them, just like that. None of them said anything to my face, but it was everywhere the next day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha remembered. It had been a headline, positing Rio as a man hater who turned down the sweetheart of her movie. Even back then, Agatha had rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “But you weren’t running,” Agatha murmured, locking eyes with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio held her gaze, and for a moment, it felt like she was staring into her soul. “But I wasn’t running,” Rio agreed. She opened her mouth then closed it. She looked away and said, “I’m going to get more coffee, and then we’re going to nail this scene, alright?” When she looked back, there was an almost unbearable tenderness in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha said quietly. “Yeah, we will.”

<div>
<p>
     Rio woke up to a mouthful of hair. It wasn’t the first time she woke up like this, and it probably wouldn’t be the last. She spit out the brown strands then nuzzled the back of Agatha’s neck. When Agatha mumbled something and rolled over, Rio smiled in surprise. She hadn’t expected her to be awake. If there was anything Rio had learned over the last few months, it was that Agatha was not a morning person.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed and buried her face into the crook of Rio’s neck. Definitely not a morning person.
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio and Agatha had been close before, they had been attached at the hip since they kissed. With anyone else, Rio would confidently say they were dating. They spent all of their time together, talking about anything and everything, doing their homework and readings, watching whatever movie Rio found that day. And kissing. A lot of kissing. Rio wasn’t sure what they were though, and everything had been so perfect lately that she hadn’t wanted to upset whatever rhythm they found.
    </p>
<p>
     Because the most glaring thing was that everything was still a secret. Not that Rio had expected anything else. Agatha was pretty much famous, thanks to her mom, and even if she wasn’t stalked by paparazzi, the students at their school stared enough to replace them. Rio and Agatha never did anything in public that friends wouldn’t do, but sometimes, Rio wondered if anyone thought there was anything else going on between them.
    </p>
<p>
     And now, to add more pressure to her, summer was coming, and Rio had no idea if this was going to end with the semester.
    </p>
<p>
     To Rio’s utter annoyance, she was going to have to be mature and actually talk about her feelings. Great.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t want to ruin this moment though. Sleepy mornings with Agatha were her favorites, a time where all of Agatha’s walls were down, where she was soft and affectionate and gentle. Rio enjoyed it until Agatha finally woke up enough to be hungry and ask (demand) Rio to cook them breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
     With a kiss to the tip of Agatha’s nose, Rio got up. After using the restroom and brushing her teeth, she stole one of Agatha’s shirts, a gray t-shirt with their school’s logo, and some shorts.
    </p>
<p>
     One of the admittedly nice things about not-dating Agatha was her fridge was always stocked, and by stocked, Rio meant real produce and meat ordered by Agatha’s mother. There was only ever shitty take-out in there if Rio ordered it. She grabbed the carton of eggs and two apples.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to miss being able to cook like this,” Rio said over her shoulder as Agatha joined her in the kitchen. She was only wearing her robe, hair a fluffy mess. She looked adorable, but Rio kept that thought to herself. “My family is big on just ordering food, so there’s never anything in our fridge.” Rio thought about a recent call from her dad and wrinkled her nose. “Then again, maybe I won’t have time to cook anyways.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hopped onto the counter near her and yawned. She asked, “What are you doing this summer?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My dad wants me to work at his company, so I’ll get to wear stuffy suits and sit through really boring meetings,” Rio said with false cheeriness, making Agatha snort.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mm, I bet you look good in those suits though,” Agatha said. She tugged on the hem of Rio’s shirt and spread her legs to make room for her to stand between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been known to turn a few heads,” Rio said. She grinned when Agatha narrowed her eyes. She placed her hands on Agatha’s thighs, rubbing circles into them with her thumbs. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, the way she always did when she talked about her mother. “Mother is filming, so she’s insisting I come with her to LA,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Surrounded by all those hot actors then?” Rio asked. She tried to sound playful, the way Agatha had when she teased her about the suits, but her voice came out more petulant than she intended.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jealous?” was all Agatha said in reply.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip before saying, “Yes.” She ducked her head, focusing on her hands. She slid them up Agatha’s legs and rested them on her hips. “Listen, I don’t want to come off like some clingy nuisance, but I also have to know…” She took a deep breath and met Agatha’s gaze. “Am I going to be mooning over you while you’re off having fun with whatever wannabe actor that catches your eye?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer immediately. She just stared at Rio with those impossibly blue eyes like she was looking for something. “Is that really what you think I’ll do?” Agatha asked. Her voice was soft, but it was impossible to tell what she was thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio admitted. She’d heard plenty of rumors about Agatha, still did, but she knew Agatha. She’d seen her at three in the morning, running through flashcards before a quiz. She’d seen her jump up and dance when she found out she passed a test. She’d seen her teary-eyed and sympathetic when Rio had cried over a god forsaken group project that almost didn’t get done. Agatha might have done something like that to other people, but Rio knew in her soul she wouldn’t do that to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just don’t know what to think,” Rio said. “I know why we don’t go out, but I guess I’m wondering if this is going anywhere. If you,” she hesitated. “If you feel the way I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I don’t just let everyone in like this,” Agatha said. She cupped her face with both hands, and Rio felt her breath catch at the way she held her like she was the most precious thing in the world. “I don’t even think I could, if I wanted to. You’re just so…” She smiled, a confused hint to it. “You’re Rio, and I don’t want anyone else.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want anyone else either,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha said, just before she kissed Rio. It was a slow kiss, and Rio could feel the way Agatha seemed to pour herself into it, like she could show Rio what she felt with this. When she pulled back, she rested her forehead against Rio’s. “It’s always going to be this way though, the hiding,” she said apologetically. “My mother…” She exhaled sharply. “It’s easier this way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you’re mine?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, “Possessive much?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you like it,” Rio replied. She kissed her again and snuck her hands under Agatha’s robe.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled into the kiss. “The eggs are burning,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a full-bodied laugh as Rio leapt away from her to grab the pan. She muttered several more curses under her breath as she dumped the blackened eggs into the trash can, shooting a half-hearted glare at Agatha. In response, Agatha merely smiled and crooked a finger at her to come back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tossed the pan into the sink and hurried back over to her. As she undid the knot of her robe and kissed her, Rio knew this was all she needed. Agatha was all she needed. As long as she had her, everything else would be fine.

<p>
     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      The cast and crew decide to celebrate the Christmas season, including Agatha and Rio.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     As the chill set in and holiday cheer filled the air, Agatha found herself actually enjoying her work.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t remember the last time that had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Filming for
     <em>
      Coven of Chaos 2
     </em>
     had proven to be a markedly different experience for her in comparison to her previous work the last few years. Although Agatha had been in a good number of things, she still thought of her recent work as a slump. Nothing truly sparked her interest. Nothing felt like a challenge. It’d been a check and nothing more.
    </p>
<p>
     Stepping back into character for this franchise was different though. Agatha got to pick apart this character that she played twenty years ago and figure out how she might have changed during all of that time. It also helped that Rio was there to parse out the character with her. As things became more and more comfortable with them, Agatha spent more time just talking to Rio about her character, going back and forth about her motivations, her fears, her desires. Not only had it been a long time since Agatha felt this much love for a character but it had also been a long time since she felt she had an equal at work to talk to.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t just Agatha who felt that way either. She watched as cast and crew alike seemed to bloom under Rio’s careful directing. Billy, although still afraid of her, also seemed to simultaneously worship her, and Lilia and Jen had commented on more than one occasion that Rio was one of their favorite directors to work with. Really, everyone seemed to agree that this set was one of their favorites to work on.
    </p>
<p>
     That was how Agatha found herself at a rented out restaurant with the cast and crew, celebrating the end of their filming until they picked back up after the new year. Unwilling to give into the Christmas festivities entirely, Agatha wore a cream sweater and jeans. Beside her, Billy wore a sweater that looked like Christmas threw up on it. Across from them, Jen and Lilia were dressed in simple reds and greens. They’d just finished dinner, and now, everyone was milling about, drinking and talking.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look ridiculous,” Agatha told him. She peered at him over her glass of spiced wine then took a healthy gulp of it. As nice as everyone was, Agatha knew she was going to need a lot of this to get through the night.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gave her that kicked puppy look of his and said, “It’s called Christmas spirit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is the ugliest sweater I’ve seen in my entire life,” Rio said as she joined them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Billy complained while Agatha lifted her glasses and said, “Thank you. Someone with taste.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been caught up with the producers at dinner, so this was Agatha’s first time properly seeing her. She was dressed in a green sweater and jeans, and to Agatha’s surprise, she was wearing her glasses. She didn’t seem as tired though, so Agatha chalked it up to laziness. They looked good on her, Agatha thought. Really good. Had they always looked that good on her? Agatha gave her head a little shake. Maybe the wine was stronger than she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     With Rio, Alice joined them as well, giving everyone a friendly smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like your sweater,” Alice told Billy. “And don’t let her fool you. She wore something like that back in college.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s only because I lost a bet with Agatha!” Rio exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was the bet?” Billy asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed and Agatha smirked, something Jen immediately noticed. “Oh, now we have to know,” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we need more drinks,” Agatha said instead of elaborating. She grabbed Jen’s arm and gave it a good yank. “Let’s go, Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That wasn’t subtle at all,” Lilia called after them, but Agatha didn’t care.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was the bet had been how many times Agatha could make her orgasm in one night, and Rio had underestimated both of them. It had been something Agatha had held over her, teasing her about it, for a long time, but there was no way in hell Agatha was telling any of their coworkers about that. Instead, Agatha distracted Jen with gossip about an affair happening among the crew, so she couldn’t press her about the bet.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they made it back to the group, the subject had been changed to holiday plans. Agatha handed Rio her whiskey and slotted herself between her and Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio whispered to her. “For not explaining the bet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My previous sex life isn’t exactly something I want to advertise,” Agatha whispered back, and Rio hid a laugh behind her drink. The streaks of possessiveness and competitiveness that still ran through her wanted to ask if Rio had been anyone who could compare to her, but she also knew it wouldn’t be fair of her. It was tempting though. Agatha swallowed the desire and asked, “So, have any favorite actors on set?”
    </p>
<p>
     It came out low and flirtatious. That wasn’t exactly any better, and Agatha watched as Rio’s eyebrows flew up.
    </p>
<p>
     “One or two come to mind,” Rio replied coyly. “Your co-lead has her charms.”
    </p>
<p>
     The young woman, Kate, who played the budding new witch of the movie was energetic and eager, reminding Agatha of a puppy. She was similar to Billy in that way. Maybe it was because they were so young. It was interesting that Rio would name her though.
    </p>
<p>
     The curiosity must have been clear on her face because Rio said, “She reminds me of you.” Rio took a sip of her drink and shrugged. “Well, younger you.” Her gaze and tone took on a wistful edge as she said, “Confident but afraid, eager to prove herself but second guessing every choice.” Rio smiled shyly and looked away from Agatha. “Makes me think of the past a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to know just how much of the past it reminded Rio of, which parts she thought about.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve changed,” was all Agatha could think to say though.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed her and smirked, “Some, but you’re still Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re still Rio,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     They held each other’s gaze for a long moment until Billy exclaimed, “Mistletoe!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio both looked up, surprised to see the sprig taped above them. Agatha narrowed her eyes. Had that always been there? It had to have been. She would have noticed Billy climbing up to put it there. Who the hell put mistletoe around at a work party? It was like they were begging HR to give them a lecture.
    </p>
<p>
     Nonetheless, Billy’s voice caught the attention of almost everyone in the room, pulling their eyes to their group.
    </p>
<p>
     “Kiss,” Jen, who was enjoying this too much, started to chant. “Kiss, kiss, kiss.” Billy joined in, but Lilia merely raised an eyebrow and Alice looked at them with wide eyes like she wasn’t sure whether to stop them or let it happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, “You think I’m going to let you pressure me into this bullshit? Come on, Jen. Aren’t you better than–” Her words stopped abruptly at the touch of Rio’s lips to her cheek. Agatha inhaled sharply and turned to look at her, but Rio merely shrugged with a slight smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a big deal,” Rio said, but Agatha could hear the lie in her voice and see the way she wouldn’t meet her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, to say what she wasn’t sure, but before she could, the muted chatter of the party came to an abrupt stop. The reason why became apparent as Evanora walked into the room. The relaxed atmosphere evaporated, and everyone awkwardly turned away from Agatha’s group. Everyone acted like the mistletoe kiss had never happened, and Rio drifted away from Agatha, as if she’d never been there in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
     The unspoken rules of her mother’s presence made Agatha prickle with irritation.
    </p>
<p>
     It seemed like the past, and her mother’s hand in it, couldn’t leave her alone.

<p>
     Rio was only sort of paying attention to the movie playing. It wasn’t that it was a bad movie, but she’d seen it before and why would she watch the movie when she had Agatha laying on top of her?
    </p>
<p>
     On particularly stressful days, this was how Agatha liked to unwind. A movie she loved, sprawled on top of or cuddled with Rio, and take-out. Rio didn’t mind at all, and if this was what helped Agatha take the edge off, then she’d sit through every movie and let her legs go numb.
    </p>
<p>
     As she absently ran her fingers through Agatha’s hair, freshly cut and only going halfway down her back instead of all the way to her hips, Rio marveled at how she got here. Two years together, and Rio still couldn’t believe it sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
     In the strangest way, things had been so easy. Their lives, their habits, their schedules, it all seemed to slot together perfectly. Although she kept her dorm with Alice, Rio more or less moved in with Agatha after they got together. She’d worried that the domesticity of it all would grate on Agatha eventually, but the other girl always brightened when she came back from class and saw Rio already there, waiting for her.
    </p>
<p>
     True to their agreement, they were never more than friends in public, but Rio had never been big on PDA anyways. They still walked around the campus and grabbed meals together. What did it matter that they never held hands or kissed? They did that plenty in the comfort of Agatha’s apartment. It wasn’t like Rio had anything to be jealous of either. Agatha’s frightening reputation continued to follow her, and it was rare that anyone was as brave as Rio had been, chancing a conversation with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wondered if she’d ever tire of the secrecy, but she didn’t like to think about that possibility, so she just didn’t. She enjoyed the moment, always just a little worried it might be the last. And maybe, just maybe, there’d been a reason for that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want some hot chocolate,” Rio said as the movie finished.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mm, does that mean I have to get up?” Agatha asked, voice muffled from where her face was pressed against Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio teased, “Well, I haven’t perfected my telekinesis yet, so yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then no.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was about to reply when the sound of a key in the front door caught her attention. Her brows furrowed as she propped herself up on her elbow. No one else had the key to this place besides the two of them. Or rather, the two of them and Agatha’s mother, who just walked in. Rio stared, frozen, as Agatha scrambled off of her, looking just as shocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mother,” Agatha said breathlessly. “What are you– This isn’t–”
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever excuses Agatha wanted to say were pointless. Rio knew it the moment she saw Evanora’s face curl into a snarl. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Agatha?” Evanora spat. “I thought you got over this phase.”
    </p>
<p>
     Both Rio and Agatha flinched. Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, squeezing it. Agatha didn’t look like she felt it at all though. She was staring up at Evanora with wide, frightened eyes. Rio had never seen her look so small before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mother, please,” Agatha said, and her voice cracked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re an ungrateful little fool,” Evanora continued, her voice getting louder with every word. “I send you here, and this is what you do? I ought to pull you from this school since this is how you decide to conduct yourself.” Evanora kept going, striding further into the apartment like she might find something else. What, Rio couldn’t imagine.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ducked her head to Rio and whispered, “You need to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio hissed. “I am not leaving you with her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” Agatha said. Her hand finally curled around Rio’s. “It’s going to get ugly, and if she decides to say something to you…” Agatha let out a shaky breath and shook her head. “Please just go. I’ll call you tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Call me as soon as she leaves,” Rio said firmly.  “Promise me, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Reluctantly, Rio got up and slipped past Evanora to leave. She wasn’t sure whether to be offended or relieved when she didn’t even seem to notice her. With one more worried look over her shoulder, Rio shut the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     The walk back to her dorm was miserable. When she let herself in, she couldn’t even sit down. She paced for a good half hour until Alice came home. Alice was visibly confused to see her there, but one look at Rio’s face kept her questions at bay. She guided her to the bare mattress that Rio used to sleep on and puttered around the room, making them tea. Alice climbed onto the bed with her, and they just sat together as Rio tried to calm her racing thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     It was nearly midnight when there was a knock on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leapt from the bed, leaving Alice sound asleep on it. As soon as she opened the door, Agatha was in her arms, burying her face in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whoa, hey,” Rio said gently. She hugged Agatha gently, stroking her hair. “I’ve got you. I’m here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come home,” Agatha said. Her hands were fisted into the fabric of Rio’s shirt. “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” Rio said. She pulled back just enough to hold Agatha’s face, and what she saw broke her heart. Agatha’s face was streaked with tears. Her eyes were still red and puffy. “Oh, love,” Rio sighed. She kissed her forehead and hugged her again. “Let’s go home.”
    </p>
<p>
     After writing Alice a note, Rio walked Agatha back to the apartment. They went straight to bed as soon as they let themselves in, and Rio let Agatha tangle their legs together as she pressed close once more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to talk about it?” Rio asked. She could already imagine what Evanora had said, but if Agatha needed to let it out, she’d let her talk about whatever she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said after a moment. “I just want to sleep and forget my mom exists.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We can do that,” Rio said. She kissed Agatha’s forehead and shut her eyes, hugging her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     It took a day or two after that for Agatha to be back to normal, but Rio didn’t push her. She just stayed by her side and held her whenever she needed it. As more days passed, Rio was able to put the incident in the back of her mind. It felt like just another bump in the road for them. Something to shrug off and not think about again.
    </p>
<p>
     At least until Rio walked out of her class to find Evanora waiting for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to talk,” Evanora said.

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha celebrates her birthday, and some secrets are revealed.
     </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Thanks to the last few weeks of being nothing more than a whirlwind of filming, Agatha lost track of the days. All she really thought about was the next scene she had to film. That was why it was such a surprise when she arrived on set one morning, only to be bombarded by confetti, balloons, and shouts of, “Happy birthday!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried not to look too overwhelmed, scrambling to understand what was happening. After a moment, she let out a quiet breath. Oh, was it her birthday already? Agatha paused. Who the hell had planned this? It wasn’t like her birthday was a secret, but it usually wasn’t celebrated like this when she was filming.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy birthday!” Billy exclaimed as he ran up to her, Jen and Lilia not far behind. Billy and Lilia wore party hats, although Lilia looked less than enthused about hers. Billy tried to put a party hat on Agatha’s head, but she swatted it out of his hand without remorse. “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate this, thanks,” Agatha said. She narrowed her eyes at him. “Did you do this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t look at me,” Billy protested. “This was all Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think anyone else knew your birthday was coming up,” Lilia admitted. “It was Rio that emailed everyone about it and coordinated with our crew to set up the food and decorations.”
    </p>
<p>
     And speaking of the devil, Rio walked onto set, wearing own stupid party hat. She grinned when she saw Agatha, joining their group. “Happy birthday,” Rio chirped. Before Agatha could react, she slipped a hat onto her head, snapping the elastic against her chin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rubbed at the sting and glared at her, but she made no move to take off the hat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Smile for all your adoring fans,” Rio said. When Agatha flipped her off, Rio’s smile just grew. She still took the picture. Looking at it, she proclaimed, “It’s perfect. I’m posting it.” Yet when Agatha reached for her phone, Rio skittered away, hiding behind Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me see,” Jen said. To Agatha’s annoyance, Rio showed it to her without hesitation. Whatever Jen saw made her laugh, full and loud. Jen shook her head while Rio moved over to Lilia to show her the photo as well. “Well, since it’s your birthday, we are getting drinks after work today,” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t have to do that,” Agatha said quickly. She’d never been one to make a big deal about her birthday. The only time she allowed it was when she was in college, and that had mainly been because of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes, saying, “This isn’t about you, Agatha. I just need an excuse to drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was hard to tell if she was just saying that to coax her into agreeing, but after a moment, Agatha said, “If that’s the case, then we’ll just go to mine. I don’t feel like dealing with any more people than I have to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Just like that, it was planned. Their little group agreed to meet at Agatha’s apartment after they finished for the day, each person agreeing to bring drinks and food. As Agatha tidied up her place that night, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d done anything like this, both for her birthday and in general. Agatha wasn’t exactly a social creature, not particularly friendly with anyone, let alone enough to invite them back to her place for drinks.
    </p>
<p>
     It was strange to think she was still capable of change after all this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was the first to arrive, arms laden with wine bottles and Thai food. On her head was that stupid party hat again, but more horrifying was the plastic crown she pulled out of her purse.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said quickly, stepping away from her. “The hat was bad enough.” During a break, Agatha had looked up Rio’s instagram, and there on her story was the picture she’d taken. It was slightly blurry, and Agatha looked more than a little annoyed. Her hand took up a third of the screen, and captioned across it was happy birthday to the one and only.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could argue, the others arrived, and Agatha was able to slip away from her to greet everyone and help them set everything up.
    </p>
<p>
     As far as birthdays went, it was one of Agatha’s better ones. They all lounged around Agatha’s living room, eating and drinking leisurely. Conversation came and went, and Agatha enjoyed how she didn’t feel the need to constantly lead the conversation. She could just fall back into the background and listen. Sometimes, Rio would lean over and murmur and aside to her, and the two of them would have their own, separate conversation. It happened a few times, and maybe it was rude, but Agatha couldn’t bring herself to care. Rio knew Agatha well, both from college and from the last few months, and she was able to add more to their conversations than the others.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward to grab a wine bottle, and with the movement, her cardigan fell off her shoulder, revealing the thin strap of her tank top and tan skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your tattoo!” Billy exclaimed. “It’s so cool!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio startled, eyes widening. With swift hands, she pulled her cardigan back up so quickly that Agatha only caught a glimpse of black ink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio mumbled. She poured herself a large glass of wine and stood up, looking spooked. “I’m going to get some air.” Without another glance back, she slipped out onto the balcony.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as the door shut behind her, they all turned accusing stares at Billy. He blanched under all of their attention and held up his hands, saying, “Whoa, hey! I just pointed out the tattoo she already told us she had. I didn’t think she’d react like that!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, one of us should go check on her,” Lilia said.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, everyone’s heads turned to stare but this time it was at Agatha instead of Billy. “Why me?” Agatha asked, even though she knew exactly why. To her annoyance, they didn’t even give an answer, instead all giving her a look. Agatha sighed and stood up, mumbling, “Fine, fine. I don’t see why I have to when it’s my birthday, but fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was cold as Agatha stepped onto the balcony, and she immediately regretted not grabbing a jacket. Rio noticed, and after a moment of hesitation, she sighed and shrugged off her sweater. “Take it,” she said, sounding resigned. “You’re shivering, and you know I run hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered arguing, but she saw the look on Rio’s face. She took it and shrugged it on. Although she tried not to, her eyes went to Rio’s shoulder. Agatha glanced at Rio, but she made no move to stop her as she stepped closer and let her fingers brush against the black ink. The tattoo was a sword, only about four inches long, but it was ornate and detailed with bold lines. Agatha traced it with her finger and pretended she didn’t feel Rio tremble at the touch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Want to give me the full story on this?” Agatha asked gently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, not quite looking at her. “I got it about two years after we broke up. A sword, for you, since well, we did always say we were a sword and shield, didn’t we? I missed you a lot, but I didn’t want to get anything embarrassing or obvious. Just a remainder, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip and pressed her hand against the tattoo. Yes, they did say that. Agatha, the sword. Sharp, aggressive, confrontational, willing to attack anyone and everyone. Rio, the shield. Grounded, strong, protective, desperate to protect herself but also Agatha from anything cruel others had to say. Agatha hadn’t thought of them like that for a long time, certainly not since Rio broke up with her, leaving her vulnerable and betrayed.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the sting of that memory, Agatha found herself leaning in. She couldn’t help it. Rio was here. She was here, and she made the entire set celebrate her birthday, and she had a tattoo for her for god’s sake, and she might not be the same exact person she was in college, but she was still Rio and if she was still Rio, then Agatha still loved her.
    </p>
<p>
     Just before their lips met though, Rio stopped her with a hand to her chest. Her hand curled around the fabric of her shirt as she said, “Wait. If we do this, I need you to know why I broke up with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “Seriously? Rio, that was literally decades ago. I’m over it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not,” Rio replied immediately. “But I understand, and it’s important that we talk about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t care!’ Agatha snapped. She slapped Rio’s hand off of her and glared at her. Everything was fine. They were good. Why did she have to ruin it like that? “That’s in the past,” she insisted. “Why should I–”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it was your mom!” Rio yelled, and Agatha felt her blood go cold. There was a sudden ringing in her ears, and Agatha could barely register the devastation on Rio’s face. Rio dragged her hands through her hair, and her voice was wrought with tears as she spoke again. “Evanora talked to me and convinced me I should break up with you, and because I was stupid and young and afraid, I did it. I’m sorry, Agatha. I’m sorry I did it, and if I could go back…” A strange look crossed her face. She didn’t finish her thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was shaking now, but Agatha couldn’t find it in her to comfort her. All she could remember was all of the times Evanora showed up recently, the way Rio would suddenly disappear from her side. Agatha always knew she hated her mother, but the rage that burned inside her now was something else entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me everything.”

      When Agatha came home from class, she was rosy-cheeked and beaming. She dropped down next to Rio on the couch, greeting her with a quick kiss. “Guess what?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, who was in the middle of reading her textbook, replied with an absent-minded, “Hmm?” Really, she should have expected it when Agatha splayed a hand over the pages to get her full attention. Smiling in exasperation, Rio looked up and said, “Yes, dear?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My mom’s not coming for my birthday anymore, so that means we can celebrate just the two of us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s smile flickered, just for a moment, before she grinned brightly. “Seriously?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, she said she has a meeting or something,” Agatha said flippantly. She leaned against her, resting her head on her shoulder. “What should we do?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s your birthday,” Rio pointed out with a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But I’m celebrating it with you,” Agatha replied. She tilted her head up, kissing Rio’s jaw. “If I had it my way, we just wouldn’t leave bed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shifted just enough to kiss her properly. “Not a bad idea,” she hummed. She traded lazy kisses with Agatha for a moment, but when she tried to deepen it, Rio reluctantly pulled away. “Sorry, I have to leave soon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “To do what?” Agatha pouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Group project,” Rio lied. “You know how it is. Gotta make sure our presentation doesn’t look like a bunch of three-year-olds put it together.” She gave Agatha one last kiss before she untangled herself from her. Looking down at her, Rio tried to memorize how she looked right now: comfortably slouched on the couch with her blue eyes looking at Rio like she was all that mattered in the world. Rio wanted to tell her how important she was to her, how she would do anything for her. Instead, Rio just said.  “I’ll be home for dinner.” She dropped a kiss to the top of her head. “Love you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine,” Agatha sighed. “Pick up some more milk on the way home, will you?” Rio nudged her leg until Agatha rolled her eyes and said, “Love you too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave her one last smile before she grabbed her things and left. As soon as the door shut behind her though, a pinched expression took over her face. She felt awful about lying to Agatha, but she didn’t trust Evanora not to do something absolutely insane in response. The older woman had explicitly told her not to say anything.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sighing, Rio shouldered her backpack and headed out to the parking lot to where a black car waited for her. Evanora insisted on meeting off-campus, most likely to lessen the chances of Agatha seeing them. Rio wanted to throw up the whole car ride.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Eventually, the car pulled up to a cafe that looked like it served lattes that cost twenty bucks. Rio would stick out like a sore thumb in her jeans and hoodie, but she didn’t have much of a choice now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Evanora was already waiting for her in a crisp suit and a bun so severe that Rio wondered if it gave her a headache. It was strange to imagine that this was the woman that Agatha came from, that they shared blood, that a smaller Agatha was around her constantly. It made Rio want to wrap Agatha up in several blankets and stash her away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was stiff as she sat down across from Evanora, muttering a thank you when a waiter immediately placed a drink in front of her. She didn’t touch it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, let’s not beat around the bush,” Evanora said. She clasped her hands in front of her, resting them on the table. Her tone was just barely polite but measured. She spoke as if this was a business meeting and not her intruding on personal affairs. “Your relationship with my daughter must end. It’s vile.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s love,” Rio shot back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s an abomination,” Evanora said, voice like steel. Unyielding and sharp. Dangerous, Rio thought. A weapon. Evanora took a deep breath. She locked eyes with Rio. Her eyes were blue like Agatha’s too, but they were still somehow so different. “End it, or I’ll end Agatha’s career before it’s even begun.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even though Rio knew this was where this was headed, she still tensed. “You wouldn’t do that,” Rio said, trying not to sound too nervous. Her nails dug into her thighs. “She’s your daughter.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I won’t allow her to have a career that’s associated with me, if this is how she’s going to behave,” Evanora said without an ounce of hesitation. She lifted her chin, peering down at Rio despite being eye level with her. “I will not have such filth tied to my name.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can’t do that,” Rio argued. It was a weak protest, but Rio found herself at a loss. What kind of a woman would ruin her daughter’s life over something like this? They weren’t even public. No one would know. “You can’t,” she repeated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can’t I?” Evanora replied. Her voice had gone silky, and Rio flinched when she realized it was the same tone that Agatha used when she knew she’d won an argument. Rio had heard it more than a few times during their relationship. It honestly pissed her off, but it was even worse coming from Evanora. “Surely, even you are aware of the power my name holds in Hollywood. I’ll make it so she never steps foot in front of a camera.” Evanora smiled, condescending and triumphant. “Which would be such a shame, considering I already have a job lined up for her when she graduates. It’s a film called
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , just the kind of thing the masses will eat up, especially because a beloved director is working on it.” Evanora’s smile grew as she gave a graceful shrug of her shoulders. “It would make a wonderful starting point for Agatha’s career, but I can still let production know that perhaps it isn’t the best for her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re a bitch,” Rio spat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m a mother,” Evanora said, as if correcting her. “I’m merely looking out for my daughter’s best interests, and you, Rio Vidal, are not anything worth her time.” She leaned forward, eyes sharpening as she took in Rio’s worn hoodie and her hunched shoulders. “Be honest with yourself. Where do you see yourself and my daughter in a year, or even five? Just her dirty little secret. You’re just a phase, an experiment. You’re nothing more than some tawdry rebellion.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio knew she shouldn’t let it get to her. She shouldn’t, not from Evanora of all people, and yet… Evanora pointed out every single one of Rio’s fears with eerie precision. It wasn’t that Rio thought being with women was a phase for Agatha, but it was that she was afraid that Rio herself was something of a phase. Well-off her family may be, but the kind of wealth and luxury Agatha came from was something else entirely. Was this just having fun to see how the other half lived before moving on to bigger and brighter things?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As for being a secret, Rio didn’t know how to grapple with that. She didn’t mind not holding hands or kissing in public, but she would be lying if she said she hadn’t thought a lot about what it would be like to proudly tell people that Agatha was her girlfriend. Rio wanted to show her off and brag. She wanted people to understand how lucky she was to love Agatha the way she did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      How much longer would Rio be able to handle not doing that?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But ultimately, it was what Evanora could offer, and consequently take away from Agatha, that made Rio truly think. A lead role in a blockbuster movie was nothing to scoff at, and while Rio had no doubts of Agatha’s talent, she also wasn’t an idiot to assume that was all it took to make it in Hollywood. With Evanora’s connections, Agatha could really make a name for herself. If Evanora were to withhold those connections, or worse, if she were to use those same connections to block Agatha from roles, Agatha’s acting career could be over before it started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t worth Agatha’s future, her career, her life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sensing Rio’s wavering resolve, Evanora spoke softly now, saying, “Don’t you want Agatha to be successful? To be happy? I can make that happen, so long as you leave her alone.” Evanora tilted her head. “I can also pay you too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Rio said sharply. “I don’t want your money.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Evanora looked at her again, almost with respect. Almost. If only she got rid of that disdain first.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I do this, you have to help her,” Rio said slowly. She locked eyes with Evanora again, making sure she understood what would happen if she didn’t.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course,” Evanora said. “As much as she’ll let me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, as much as you possibly can,” Rio said. “And I don’t mean just handing her things she doesn’t deserve, even though she deserves everything. I mean you put her name out there, let her talent speak for itself. You make sure people know who she is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Evanora scoffed, “She’s my daughter. Everyone already knows who she is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, they know Evanora Harkness’s daughter,” Rio said. “I want them to know Agatha Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Again, Evanora got that look in her eye again. Like she wanted to like Rio but refused to actually go through with it. “Fine. Deal.” She held out her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio clenched her jaw, but she still took her hand and shook it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A pleasure meeting with you,” Evanora said, and a moment later, the driver was back at Rio’s side to drive her back to campus.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of that night passed by in a blur. She vaguely remembered Agatha asking if she was okay, but she made up some excuse about stupid group members. The next few weeks were a blur honestly, just an uncomfortable haze as Rio tried to figure out when she was going to ruin her life for the woman she loved.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio allowed herself one last time to celebrate Agatha’s birthday with her. The two of them spent the weekend at a small town on the coast, enjoying lazy mornings in bed and walking on the beach even in the cold. They were always in their own world, but it felt even more so there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wish we could stay like this forever,” Agatha said, sitting between Rio’s legs with her back pressed to Rio’s front. They had a blanket wrapped around them and a fire going as they watched the waves crash into shore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’d get sick of me,” Rio joked weakly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed and kissed her cheek. “No, I think you’d get sick of me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was a slice of heaven, and Rio bitterly thought at least she would have this last memory of them together before it was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio finally did break up with Agatha, just as the winter began to warm into spring, it was also a blur, just as everything else had been. She wasn’t sure how she even said it, what excuses she gave. All she could see was the hurt, the betrayal, on Agatha’s face. All she could see was the tears falling onto her cheeks, the flush that spread across her face, the growing hatred in her very being. Agatha slapped her across the face, and Rio let her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I hate you!” Agatha shouted tearfully. “I’ll never forgive you for this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      I know, Rio wanted to say. I know.
     </span>

<div>
<p>
<span>
      The chill in Agatha’s bones had nothing to do with the cold anymore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It started snowing as Rio explained to everything that happened in the past, and by the time she finished, there was a fine dusting of snow on them. Agatha wasn’t even sure if she felt the cold, at least not in that way. The heaviness in her limbs and the tightness in her chest had nothing to do with standing on this balcony and everything to do with her mother’s manipulations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry,” Rio said lamely. “I know I could have told her no, or I could have even reached out to you sooner, but I just…” She trailed off, shaking her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed her lips together and stared out into the city, trying to wrap her head around what she’d just learned. Eventually, after a few minutes, Agatha said, “How could you do that? How could you listen to her?” Her voice started soft, but it quickly grew in anger and volume. All of the thoughts she’d had over the years came tumbling out of her. “I loved you, Rio. I loved you like I never thought I’d ever be able to love anyone, and you just– you just left. You left with your stupid bullshit reasons, and all I could think was that you finally realized I wasn’t worth sticking around for.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio inhaled sharply while Agatha froze. She hadn’t meant to say that last part. She never wanted Rio to know just how deeply she cut at her insecurities when she broke up with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha…” Rio reached out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t touch me,” Agatha hissed. She shoved Rio hard and watched in satisfaction as the other woman stumbled back a few steps. “Was it worth it? Leaving me like that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Instead of looking chastised, Rio’s face reddened and pulled into an angry snarl. “For you? Yes!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look at you, Agatha!” Rio cried out. “You’re making a sequel to the very same movie your mother swore to me would make you a household name, and guess what, it did.” She shook her head, and her whole body seemed to tremble. “As much as I hated it, the movie did exactly what it was supposed to do. It made you famous. It made people realize just how talented you are. It made people see you as more than just your mother’s daughter.” Each sentence hit Agatha like a physical blow, especially the last, and it took everything in her not to visibly react. “What would have happened if I’d stayed? Your mother never would have given you the role, and where would you be now?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would’ve made it,” Agatha snapped, hurt by the insinuation she wouldn’t have.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t even flinch. She countered ruthlessly, “Would you? With your mother working against you at every turn?” Her laugh was bitter and biting. “I think we both know she would have done it too. She would have punished you for disobeying her, and you never would have found any work.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s not fair,” Agatha said because she knew Rio was right. Evanora would have made it damn near impossible for her to find work. Still. “You don’t know I wouldn’t have made it without her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This only seemed to rile Rio up even more. Her hands gripped her hair as she said, “Don’t you think I know that? Don’t you think I spent every day after I broke up with you wondering if I gave us up for nothing?” Rio was so distraught that Agatha almost took a step back, but she couldn’t. She couldn’t look away as tears welled up in Rio’s eyes and her voice went hoarse. “I couldn’t risk that though. I couldn’t be the reason you didn’t get what you wanted.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wanted
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you!
      </span>
</em>
<span>
<em>
       ”
      </em>
      Agatha shouted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Silence fell between them, punctuated only by their heavy breaths.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, feeling tears prick her eyes. “I wanted you,” Agatha repeated brokenly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio said nothing, Agatha thought she left. A moment later though, her arms wrapped around her and pulled her to her. Agatha thought about fighting it, but the conversation left her drained, so she let herself fall into Rio. She buried her face into her shoulder and clutched at her back as if she might be able to anchor her. They stayed like that for a while, and Agatha felt her heart rate slow back to normal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wanted you too,” Rio whispered. “You were all I ever wanted.” Her lips brushed Agatha’s temple. “And after these last few months, you’re still all I want.” She pulled back just enough to cup Agatha’s face, thumb stroking her damp cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How?” Agatha asked. “How can you possibly still want me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t think I ever stopped wanting you,” Rio told her. “I love you, Agatha. I love how much thought you put into your acting when you care. I love how much you look out for young actors, because you remember what it was like. I love how, even after all this time, you try to act like you’re above it all, that you don’t care what others think of you, but you do. You care so much it hurts. You’re so stubborn and smart, sometimes in a way that drives me insane, but it’s you, Agatha. It’s always been you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The confession echoed in Agatha’s mind, so many of the things Agatha had longed to hear not just in her youth but also recently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Kiss me?” Agatha asked, hating how vulnerable she sounded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio softened and tilted her face toward her. She kissed her once, gently, and Agatha felt her heart flutter. She opened her eyes and met Rio’s warm brown eyes, feeling at peace for the first time in years.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If we do this, it’s going to take me a while to get over this,” Agatha told her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s okay,” Rio shrugged. “It’s also okay if you don’t forgive me for this. I’m not sure if I’ll ever forgive myself, but at the very least, I know I’m lucky to have a second chance with you.” She rested her forehead against hers and smiled. “I’ve waited twenty years for this, Agatha. Take as much time as you need.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Yes, she was terrified and furious and desperate and everything in between, but she was also with Rio. Just as the last few months helped Rio understand all she wanted was her, those same months made Agatha remember how it felt to be with Rio, to have someone who seemed to just get her and accept her for who she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was Agatha who initiated the kiss this time, more than just an innocent press of the lips as she opened her mouth to Rio and moaned as their tongues met. Agatha could have kissed her all night, if not for the fact that they were outside where it was freezing and she still had guests over.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were breathless when they parted, and Agatha smiled at the way Rio looked at her. It was the same way she looked at her all those years ago.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s get back inside,” Agatha said. “If those nosy assholes don’t already have their faces pressed to the window, I’m sure they have a lot of questions for us.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, “Right, and we won’t tell them a thing?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not a damn thing,” Agatha smirked.
     </span>
</p>

      Just as Agatha predicted, everyone gave them knowing stares when they walked back into the living room, but they showed remarkable self-control by not asking what happened. Instead, they all wore the same curious expressions, all but begging Agatha to say something with their eyes. Agatha wouldn’t cave into them though, and when she kicked them out an hour later, they still knew nothing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was the last to leave, and as she went to grab her jacket, Agatha touched her arm. She bit her lip when Rio looked at her. “Stay?” she asked quietly. “Earlier was a lot, and I just need…” She trailed off, hoping Rio would understand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And of course, she did. She left her jacket and followed Agatha back to her bedroom. They changed into some of Agatha’s pajamas and slid under the blankets on her bed. Agatha thought it’d be strange to be in bed with someone else, especially Rio, after all this time, but it felt normal. They slotted together just as they always did, and as Agatha shut her eyes, Rio’s heartbeat steady under her ear, she felt a thread of hope.

<div>
<p>
<span>
      As she scanned the crowded room, Rio fought the urge to fidget with her clothes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Almost a decade in the industry, Rio still felt out of place at events like this. At least for this one, she had a better excuse for why she felt so awkward. For the first time in her career, Rio’s film was nominated for her directing for a major award. Her movies had more or less done well, but this was more mainstream recognition than she’d ever gotten before. Rio had never attended anything quite this big, and she felt like that fact was stamped on her forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio downed the rest of her champagne and glanced down at herself. A simple black suit, no shirt, leaving a daringly low cut. Rio sighed and grabbed another glass from a passing waiter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wished they could just announce the winners and let this be over already.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Alice finally appeared, Rio practically ran to her side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There you are,” Rio muttered, clinging to her arm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Needy much?” Alice laughed. She patted Rio’s hand and said, “Don’t worry. You’ve only got a few hours left.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, that’s it?” Rio said sarcastically. She shook her head and looked around the room again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There were only a few people Rio personally knew. Everyone else were big names that would probably be polite to Rio but would also wonder why some no-name director was talking to them. No, it was safer to just stick by Alice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes noticed a small crowd by the stage. Curious, she lifted onto her toes to see what was happening. She craned her neck, but when Rio caught a glimpse of brown hair and blue eyes, she fell abruptly back onto her heels.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was here.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The realization hit Rio like a punch to the gut, knocking all the air from her lungs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fighting back the instinct to just run, Rio looked over at the crowd again, and there she was. Agatha looked beautiful in a long, white dress that was draped over her in a way that made her look more like a goddess than a mortal like the rest of them. Although visibly older than her college years, Agatha was no less stunning. If anything, Rio would argue she’d only gotten prettier.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not that this was news to Rio. Ever since
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Coven of Chaos
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      came out, Rio had followed Agatha’s career, watching as she got rave reviews and landed more and more lead roles. It was exactly what Rio had wanted for her, but it still hurt not to be able to be by her side through it all. Sometimes, Rio thought about reaching out to her, especially three years ago when she finally came out and distanced herself from her mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hand had hovered over her phone for hours as she fought with herself. In the end, she never called. Rio didn’t think it’d be fair to just force herself back into Agatha’s life that way. Besides, what was she going to do? Tell her that Evanora made her do it? Then what? Agatha would probably spit in her face then kick her to the curb. Understandably so too.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So, Rio was relegated to watching Agatha’s success from afar, trying to ignore the lingering threads of love that kept her tied to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice finally noticed Rio’s staring and sighed, “Oh, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t,” Rio said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Alice was the only other person besides Rio and Evanora that knew what had really happened between Rio and Agatha, right down to why Rio broke up with her. Rio hadn’t planned on telling her, but when Rio had shown back up at their dorm, a complete wreck, it had come pouring out of her in between her sobs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Despite calling her an idiot, Alice understood why she’d done it and supported Rio as best as she could over the years, especially as Agatha’s face and name became more and more widespread.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come on,” Alice said, wrapping an arm around Rio’s shoulders. “Let’s get you a drink.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the night, Rio more or less sulked and watched Agatha from afar, catching pieces of others’ conversations where they’d praise Agatha for her latest role. It made Rio proud still, to know people recognized her talent. In this last movie, Agatha had played a single mother fighting to make ends meet for her son. It made pretty much everyone cry when they watched it, Rio included.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had lost count of how many drinks she had when a reporter walked up to her and introduced herself as Valerie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How does it feel to finally get nominated?” Valerie asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Finally?” Rio repeated with a laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, of course. You’ve made some other great films, but this is the first that’s being properly recognized.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio squirmed at the compliment and shrugged, “It’s an honor, of course. I can only hope I can continue to make movies worth talking about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is there anyone you’d like to work with in the future? Any actor or actress?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ag–” Rio clamped her mouth shut, realizing what her alcohol-loosened tongue had almost said. If she said Agatha, then Agatha would likely hear about it, or worse, another journalist would ask her about it. Rio covered up her slip up by saying, “Agnes O’Connor would be interesting to work with. We’re usually in different genres, so trying to meld those would be a challenge, but a good one, I think.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Valerie didn’t seem to notice anything strange and continued her questions, thankfully focusing more on Rio’s movie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Valeria moved on to someone else, Rio was ready to call it a night. Her eyes drifted back to Agatha, only to feel a sharp stab to her chest when she saw another woman hanging off her arm. She was gorgeous, of course, and stared at Agatha like she hung the moon. Rio remembered when that was her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s mouth tasted bitter all of the sudden.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was why when an actress approached her a little while later, all coy smiles and lingering touches, Rio let it happen. She let her take Rio’s hand and walk her out of the party and take her home and fuck in her apartment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t help really. Rio just pretended it did.

<div>
<p>
     When filming came to an end, it was a bittersweet ending for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     If you had told Agatha a year ago that by the time they finished filming, she would be back with her ex-girlfriend from college, she would have slapped you. Hard. But now, Agatha couldn’t deny that she was dating Rio, happier than she’d been in a long time. Sure, there’d been some fights, not to mention a few more heated arguments over their past, but they were getting to a better place every time.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as the final take was done, Agatha searched for her, giving her a wide smile when their eyes locked.
    </p>
<p>
     “And that’s it!” Rio shouted, followed by cheers and applause. She hopped out of her seat, and Agatha could tell she was trying to slow her walk to her. It wasn’t that they were hiding their relationship per say, but they weren’t exactly advertising it either. Still, Agatha walked straight into Rio’s arms, hugging her tight with tears in her eyes. “You’re amazing,” Rio whispered to her. She lifted her slightly off the ground, and Agatha buried her face in her neck, hiding for just a moment. “I’m so lucky to have you,” Rio said as she set her down, and Agatha could hear the double meaning in it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hastily wiped her tears away and turned to her co-stars. She wasn’t one for hugs, but she let it happen. None of the hugs were as long as Rio’s, more brief squeezes than anything else, but it was more than Agatha normally gave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it wasn’t totally awful working with you again,” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you loved it,” Agatha smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes while Lilia patted her arm and said, “Don’t be a stranger after this.” She glanced at Rio and added, “I don’t think you will be though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blushed despite herself and said, “If you want to pay for my lunch some time, I wouldn’t say no.”
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Agatha was finally allowed to leave, she was exhausted. The emotions of the day had gotten to her, and all she wanted to do now was crawl into bed and sleep. With a quick text to Rio, she went to do just that. Rio still had some things to deal with on the production side of things, so she said she’d see Agatha that weekend for the wrap party.
    </p>
<p>
     Normally, Agatha went to wrap parties just to show face and stay on everyone’s good sides, but this time, she was actually looking forward to it. Although the movie was by no means done, it was now at a point where it wouldn’t be as dramatic if everyone knew Agatha and Rio were dating. And that was what Agatha wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     A lot of her and Rio’s conversations had been dissecting their years in college, and they both agreed that it would be for the best to be as open about their relationship as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     That was why Agatha was tense, tapping her foot, as she waited at the bar for Rio to show up. Billy was with her, talking about some guy he was going to go on a date with, and Agatha tried her best to listen. It was a good distraction, but there was only so much gushing she could hear from Billy before she felt like throwing up.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio arrived, and Agatha took a moment to appreciate just how good she looked. She wore a cream suit with a matching vest and no shirt underneath. It only took Rio a moment to find her, and Agatha saw the same desire she felt reflected on Rio’s face. Agatha smirked and flipped her hair over her shoulder, beckoning her over. She knew she looked good in the cobalt blue dress, tailored to flatter every curve.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Rio greeted her, sidling up close. She placed a hand on the bar so her arm was more or less around Agatha’s waist. Rio waved down the bartender and offered a less enthusiastic hello to Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Unperturbed, Billy grinned and said, “Hey! Ready to celebrate?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Something like that,” Rio said. She hid her smirk behind the glass the bartender handed her and glanced at Agatha. Their eyes met, and Agatha bit her lip to keep her smile from growing too large. Yes, they had plenty of plans to celebrate later. Clearing her throat, Rio said, “So, what do you guys do at these things? I usually get drunk just enough to tolerate everyone else and gorge myself on free food.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you do,” Agatha said fondly.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s always good food,” Rio shrugged, acting like she was still a college student and not a renowned director.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clucked her tongue and said, “Well, none of that tonight. You’re staying with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re acting like I can’t do both.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I’ve seen you when you make it your personal mission to eat as much as possible. You are not doing that tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held Rio’s gaze for a long moment, raising her brow. After a moment, Rio deflated and said, “Yeah, okay, fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, what else can you get her to agree to?” Jen teased as she walked up to the group.
    </p>
<p>
     “A lot,” Agatha said at the same time Rio said, “Nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them shared another look while Billy and Jen laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     As the wrap party went on, it proved to be the most enjoyable Agatha had ever attended. That had more to do with Rio than anything else. As agreed upon, Rio stayed by her side, keeping her company while others drifted towards them every so often to talk. Some talked more to Agatha, others more to Rio, but everyone seemed to understand that they were a package deal for the night.
    </p>
<p>
     “No sign of your mother yet,” Rio murmured as she looked around. Her hand had gravitated towards Agatha’s back throughout the night, now resting firmly against the small of it and idly drawing shapes when she got bored. “How are you feeling?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like I could use another drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and stepped closer, pressing their sides together. “Pace yourself. We still have plans for later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We do, don’t we?” Agatha hummed. She turned her head, surprised to find Rio so close. She didn’t move away though, only smiling as she looked into warm, brown eyes. “Thanks for directing this movie.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for acting in it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha surprised herself by leaning in, but she didn’t stop. Their lips met in a gentle kiss, and when they broke apart, Agatha couldn’t help the smile that spread across her face. When she looked away though, it was to lock eyes with her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh oh,” Rio mumbled under her breath. She didn’t move away though. She didn’t disappear from her side like all of those other times. She stayed close, hand sliding to rest on her hip and hold her. “We can walk away,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said firmly. “I’m done running from her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her head high as Evanora stormed up to her. It was only because she was so focused on her that she saw the hand coming. Agatha caught Evanora’s wrist before her hand could make contact, even as she splayed her open palm just inches from her face. Agatha was faintly aware of the dead silent restaurant around them now, but she didn’t care.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello, mother,” Agatha said with false pleasantry. “Can I help you with something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You should have some decorum,” Evanora hissed. “You’re at work.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And raising a hand to your daughter at work is so much better?” Agatha replied.
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora’s face was flushed and furious as she set her gaze on Rio. “I see you came crawling back,” Evanora snarled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tensed, but Rio merely smiled and said, “Happily so. Good to see you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “This pathetic little farce of a relationship won’t last,” Evanora said, but Agatha could only laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell that to someone who cares what you think,” Agatha said, and it was with deep satisfaction that she saw a trace of fear cross her mother’s face. She let go of her wrist. “Have a good night, mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora looked like she wanted to say more, but she seemed to finally be aware of the eyes on them. With one last glare, Evanora walked away, no doubt going to ruin some poor executive’s night.
    </p>
<p>
     As her mother walked away, Agatha caught people exchanging money. While she was annoyed, it was tempered by the approving smiles and nods sent her way. It made her want wonder just what others thought of her and Rio. Not that it really mattered in the end. It was also a bit of a relief that it appeared no one was going to hold this against her though, especially considering the fit her mother was undoubtedly going to throw behind closed doors
    </p>
<p>
     Rio brushed her lips against her temple and asked, “Think that’s the last we’ve seen of her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not some cartoon villain,” Agatha snorted. “I’m sure she’ll be a pain in the ass again eventually.” She managed another smile for Rio though, resting her forehead against hers. “I’m sure we can handle it though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Together,” Rio said. Her smile was tender, and her eyes were full of love as she met Agatha’s lips again. “Hey, by the way. Be in my next movie?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile was more genuine as she laughed, “Oh, I think I’ll make you work for that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, “Can’t wait.”
