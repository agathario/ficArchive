<div class="userstuff">
<p>"I'm home!"</p><p>Agatha looks up gratefully from the hot pan in front of her and wipes her hands on a dish towel. </p><p>"Good timing, did you grab the heavy cream?"</p><p>"Yup, got everything on the list and your meds."</p><p>Agatha looks through the grocery bags for the carton she needs to make the sauce for their dinner that night and sighs heavily when she finds it, holding it up.</p><p>"This isn't heavy cream."</p><p>Ralph straightens from behind the opened refrigerator door and looks at her in confusion. "Yes it is."</p><p>Agatha points to the label. "Buttermilk," she sighs again. "There goes sauce for dinner."</p><p>He continues putting the rest of the groceries away, knowing Agatha is going to rearrange them the way she likes later but Agatha presses her lips together to keep herself quiet. </p><p>"Sorry, honey," he apologizes and gathers up the empty bags to store them away. </p><p>"I sent you a picture," she grumbles and grabs oil and garlic instead, trying to improvise from what she has, adding it to the pan.</p><p>Ralph's arms circle her waist and the weight of his chin lands on her shoulder. "And this is why I let you handle the shopping," he chuckles, self-depreciating. </p><p>He kisses her cheek. "At least I remembered the coffee and your meds?"</p><p>"Small miracles," she scoffs, the corner of her mouth lifting. "Can you get the plates and forks? It's almost done."</p><p>Ralph smiles and withdraws, rubbing his hands over her hips, "Yes, ma'am."</p><p>"How was work?" She asks out of habit, portioning the chicken and pasta dish onto the two plates after he sets them down.</p><p>"Same as usual," he grunts, taking a seat at the table. "Might get a little crazy again soon, FBI contacted us for some contract investigation."</p><p>Agatha frowns and takes the empty pan to the sink to deal with after dinner and brings the plates to the table, setting his down first before taking her seat across the table.</p><p>"FBI?" She asks with concern.</p><p>Ralph brushes it off, picking up his fork and spearing pieces of chicken. "Happens all the time," he says around a mouthful. "Just covering our asses."</p><p>A year ago, Ralph had moved from executive to CEO at VersaRX, one of the largest pharmaceutical drug companies in the tristate area. </p><p>Agatha is rather proud of him for it, he seemed dedicated to working upward, teasing her often that he has to work harder to afford her but she only rolls her eyes and nudges him away when he laughs. </p><p>"From what?" Agatha takes her own bite. It isn't what she planned to make but it's fine nonetheless.</p><p>"Can't say without a subpoena, counselor," Ralph smiles at her knowingly and Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p>The sensitive and secretive nature of drug development often meant strict NDAs and threats of legal action for spilling sacred industry secrets. </p><p>It doesn't stop her from asking; Ralph says it's a part of her charm.</p><p>She is unafraid to challenge the alphas around her, never letting them take advantage of her station or abuse theirs and besting them all academically when they were in college, taking power where she could in a world so determined to keep her in check.</p><p>Ralph had been instantly smitten, following her around with heart eyes like a lost puppy. He learned quickly by watching that being traditionally alpha and aggressive would get him verbally eviscerated so he approached softly, almost deferent, in their interactions. </p><p>When they got married, he promised he would work the rest of his life to be the best for her and take care of her the way she deserved. </p><p>And when he'd claimed her, biting down on the base of her neck in the heat of passion, she believed with her entire being he would be a good alpha and a good father. </p><p>"Fine," Agatha points her fork at him. "Keep your secrets."</p><p>They finish dinner and Agatha loads the dishwasher while Ralph makes her a cup of tea, falling easily into their nightly routine. </p><p>Settling on the couch, Agatha reaches for the remote and turns on a reality show over Ralph's groans. </p><p>"Do we have to? Can't we watch something else?"</p><p>"You promised," she whines back at him and it's his turn to roll his eyes, pulling out his phone to ignore the overly-peppy singles stuck on an island on screen.</p><p>Agatha huffs but doesn't complain further; at least he's sitting with her. Usually he would go upstairs, leaving her to watch alone until she was tired enough to go to bed. </p><p>It disappoints Agatha every time, especially when she is closer to her heat but she learned a while ago to deal with it when he would complain more than he would watch, until it was easier to just watch without him. </p><p>She's about halfway through her mug of tea and a tearful confession of cheating from a blonde alpha when Ralph interrupts. </p><p>"Did you buy something today?"</p><p>"Hm?" She's half-listening, still trying to track what's happening on screen when it flashes back to the scandalous moment. "Oh, yeah, I bought a dress for your work gala."</p><p>The blonde alpha is screaming at a male omega now, saying a kiss isn't even cheating. </p><p>"Another one? You can't wear one you have already?"</p><p>The male omega tells the blonde he wants to unmatch and dramatic music plays over strategic zoom-ins of faces.</p><p>"I've worn most of them already. The last time I wore my black one you said it was so old you were ready to donate it."</p><p>Ralph grumbles under his breath and Agatha goes back to watching her show, the host now recapping the previous night's events.</p><p>Agatha is familiar with the signs of his irritation but she ignores it hoping it will pass.</p><p>Ralph fidgets next to her, his leg bouncing up and down where she leans against his side. He sighs and adjusts once, and then again. </p><p>The next time he sighs, Agatha growls and pauses her show, annoyed with having to split her attention. </p><p>"What?" She asks, turning to him.</p><p>"Nothing," Ralph stares at the screen, playing with his phone and scrolling through his social media aimlessly.</p><p>"Spit it out," she snaps, not interested in playing a guessing game when he's clearly being passive aggressive.</p><p>"It's... sweetheart," Ralph's tone is placating and he finally exits out of his phone. "We're supposed to be saving for a family."</p><p>Agatha sits up. "I know that," she protests. "I just got paid and I checked the account before I bought it."</p><p>Her paycheck isn't as big as his but she makes enough to spend some on herself before putting it all into their joint account.</p><p>"Yeah but I wish you'd told me at least," he leans his head back against the couch, already weary of the conversation. "Budgeting is hard and I want to be sure we're ready when we have kids."</p><p>She crosses her arms over her chest. "I get that but it's my money in there too and we still have a lot of time before we have any kids."</p><p>"Life happens, Agatha, what if you get pregnant next month or next year?" He counters, leg jumping up and down again.</p><p>"In spite of the suppressants and birth control?" She arches an eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha had been clear with him from the start that she wouldn't give up on a career just to have some alpha's offspring and he had agreed, telling her he would support her until she was ready. </p><p>Now, the closer they get to being ready it feels like, in his excitement, Ralph is rushing onto the next stage while she hesitates.</p><p>"Accidents happen," he shrugs and Agatha feels another prickle of irritation. </p><p>She's been on suppressants since she presented and birth control since college, there is no way she is letting herself get pregnant on accident. Not if she can help it. </p><p>Omegas have been at the mercy of ill-intentioned alphas for centuries due to the madness that would overcome them during their heat, begging any compatible alpha to be bred just to end the torture inflicted by their traitorous body. </p><p>The suppressants don't take away her yearly heat but they do make it much more bearable. </p><p>It makes Agatha wince when she thinks about it, appalled at the idea of being so desperate. </p><p>Thank god for modern medicine. </p><p>"We've been careful," Agatha counters. She tracks her cycles, doesn't let him knot during her heat and takes her medication religiously. </p><p>"I'm just worried, Agatha," he looks at her fully, large blue eyes watery like he's pained to admit it. Agatha feels a pang of guilt in her stomach.</p><p>"I care about our future, I want to make sure we're ready." </p><p>Agatha knows he does and she feels guilty for making him think she doesn't. She folds, shoulders and head dropping when she exhales. "I know, and I love you for it."</p><p>Ralph grins tentatively, relief painting his face when Agatha agrees. "I love you too. Next time could you ask before you buy anything? That way I'm not surprised." He leans forward and wraps an arm around her. "I don't like upsetting you."</p><p>She can smell the tobacco and patchouli coming off of him, meant to calm her down. She considers pushing back but ultimately decides against it.</p><p>"Yeah, okay," Agatha concedes, leaning on his shoulder while he kisses her forehead. </p><p>"Thanks, sweetheart," he murmurs, giving her a squeeze and standing up from the couch. "I'm gonna go upstairs, don't be too long okay?"</p><p>"You're not going to stay?" Agatha looks up at him, frowning. </p><p>"Nah, long day," he leans down to peck her lips. "Night, babe."</p><p>Agatha tilts her head to kiss him back. "Goodnight," she mutters.</p><p>She watches him leave up the stairs and un-pauses her show but she's lost the storyline of the episode and just lets it play.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"Hey Ralph, good to see ya!" The salt-and-pepper-haired alpha shakes Ralph's hand and claps him on his suited shoulder. </p><p>"Paul! Nice to see you again," Ralph returns the handshake and Agatha smiles next to him, new red cocktail dress clinging to her hips and shoulders, keeping quiet until it's her turn to speak. </p><p>She's developed and perfected a manicured facade for Ralph's work functions, smiling and shaking hands with clients and donors as appropriate while she counts down the hours until they can leave. </p><p>At least at her own functions she has some semblance of control; able to be freer with her words and command the room. Status be damned.</p><p>Here, though, with Ralph, he worries about impressions, begging Agatha to curb some of her more acerbic tendencies so as not to offend any donors or clientele. </p><p>"You remember my mate, Agatha?" Ralph gestures to her and Paul grins, looking her up and down, holding out his arms. </p><p>Agatha has gotten to know Paul over time after attending multiple VersaRX fundraisers. Though he is one of the partners in the company, she still isn't sure what exactly his job is aside from spending company money and chasing omegas but Ralph puts on a fake smile when he comes around and laughs at his jokes. </p><p>Agatha, however, despises him.</p><p>"Of course! Beautiful as ever," he clasps her shoulders and kisses her cheek. Up close she can smell alcohol and his own odd mothball alpha scent. </p><p>"This is my new mate, Kelly," Paul stands aside and gestures to a young blonde omega Agatha hadn't noticed until then. </p><p>She looks no older than twenty, heavy makeup aging her up from far away, low-cut silver dress showing off a brand new mating mark against her collarbone just above an ample sized chest. A large diamond sits on her left hand and Agatha thinks she's never seen anyone so naive. </p><p>"Nice to see you, Paul," she nods at the blonde, "Kelly."</p><p>"It isn't past her curfew?" Agatha questions, keeping her tone light though her eyes bore through the older alpha. </p><p>Ralph chuckles nervously next to Agatha and Paul's smile dips for a second before recovering. </p><p>"Ha! She does look good doesn't she?" He slides an arm around the blonde's waist, pulling her to him. </p><p>Agatha can smell her candy sweet scent and wrinkles her nose, the smell still too close to a child to have matured properly. </p><p>"Adorable," Agatha hums. "What playground did you two meet at?"</p><p>Ralph squeezes her arm.</p><p>Paul doesn't lose a step, smug bastard that he is, and laughs. </p><p>"Sharp as ever, Agatha," he grins, all veneers. </p><p>"My ex-mate left me for another alpha. I was a wreck, needed to do something and get out and have fun. So I went on a cruise, met Kelly here and it was love at first sight," he turns to her and winks, making her giggle and Agatha stifles a gag.</p><p>"Sorry to hear that, Paul," Ralph interrupts before Agatha can say anything else. "Glad it's on the up and up again."</p><p>Paul shakes his hand and tells them he'll see them around, opting to mingle with the handful of guests by the bar, dragging his new mate behind him obliviously.</p><p>Ralph growls and Agatha can smell the familiar spiced tobacco scent of his disapproval. </p><p>"He's old enough to be her grandfather," Agatha whispers, already anticipating his rebuke.</p><p>"Not your place," he grinds out, and grabs her arm, steering her toward another couple. </p><p>"How many barely legal omegas are out there running around with his teeth-"</p><p>"<em>Not</em>. <em>Your place</em>." Ralph's voice is quiet but the tone of command is clear.</p><p>"Please, Agatha, we both know everyone in here is a sleeze-bag, the faster you bite your tongue the faster we can leave." Ralph straightens as they approach a couple and holds out his hand to greet the other alpha. </p><p>Agatha is able to frown for only a second before another round of introduction begins.</p><p>"Hey, George! Nice to see you! You remember Agatha?"</p><p>-------------</p><p>"Hello? What do you want?"</p><p>
<em>"Hello, Jen, how are you? No, I'm not dead. Sorry I haven't been answering your texts recently. How can I make up for my shortcomings as a friend?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes so hard she's pretty sure she sees her own ass. </p><p>"Hello, Jen."</p><p>"<em>Agatha! So nice to hear from you</em>," Jen continues teasing, her voice high and overly sweet. </p><p>"Yes. Hello. I'm alive. Now what do you want, Kale?" </p><p>Agatha holds her phone between her shoulder and ear, answering the last few emails of her work day, securing a consult and another meeting with a client for later in the week to discuss settlement. </p><p>Jen is a pain in the ass but her words hold no true bite, not like when they first met during post-grad, becoming roommates in a shared flat and clawing at each other's throats whenever they got the chance.</p><p>Some how, though, the fire and pressure of law school and passing the bar melded them into friends and as the years went on and she got married and mated, Jen was the only one to stick around. </p><p>Hence, the phone call. </p><p>"<em>Well first I had to be sure you weren't dead, thanks for confirming by the way.</em>"</p><p>Agatha snorts. </p><p>"<em>Second, I saw the news today, they mentioned VersaRX.</em>"</p><p>Agatha sighs, already familiar with the story.</p><p>Ralph had not been happy, storming out of the house that morning and grumbling about emergency meetings. She remembers him telling her about the FBI contract investigation but it's a bigger case than she originally thought. </p><p>VersaRX is being drawn in connection to a possible case of omega trafficking; pills found at crime scenes leading the FBI to the pharmaceutical company.</p><p>"Yeah, Ralph left early today to deal with it. They're working with the FBI to see if it's an internal leak or one of their clients, but the PR is going to be a nightmare."</p><p>Emails sent, Agatha shuts down her computer and starts gathering her things. </p><p>"Is that all you called about? To check on Ralph's company? He'll be so touched you care." </p><p><em>"Ew, don't you ever say something so vile ever again. I'm still waiting for the day you dump his ass and go full eat, pray, love."</em> </p><p>Agatha cackles. For as much as Jen loves Agatha, she hates Ralph more. </p><p>Since the day Agatha introduced Jen to her then-fiancé, Jen asked her at least once a week if she had broken up with him yet, citing her gut when Agatha asked for a good reason. </p><p>To Jen's ever growing disappointment, they stayed together.</p><p>"<em>Anyway</em>," Jen drawls, "<em>Come out tonight to the White Tail, it's been too long. I'll even let you drag the idiot along</em>."</p><p>Agatha groans because she does want to go. She misses her only friend and it's been ages since she did anything outside of work but she hesitates. Ralph hates the White Tail.</p><p>"I don't know..."</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>," Jen's voice is stern. Her "lawyer voice" as she calls it. "<em>It's been too long. Get your ass to the White Tail in thirty minutes. Bye!</em>"</p><p>She hangs up and Agatha ends the call, unlocking her car door and putting her bag down first before sliding behind the wheel and taking a moment to deliberate.</p><p>Ralph likes to be with her when she goes out but she knows he won't be too happy with the last minute planning. </p><p>And the White Tail, Agatha grimaces.</p><p>He has his own opinions about the places she and Jen frequent, wrinkling his nose in distaste at the food or the wait service or the atmosphere. Jen hates it and calls him uncultured.</p><p>She <em>could</em> just go by herself. Ralph is probably tired from his early day and if he hates the place, it might be better if she let him stay home and have the house to himself for a few hours.</p><p>Agatha starts the car and sends a voice note to Ralph, letting him know her plans and drives the short distance to the White Tail, seeing Jen's car already parked in the small lot. </p><p>By the time she greets Jen and removes her coat to hang on the back of her chair, her phone rings, Ralph's name appearing on the caller ID.</p><p>"Ignore it," Jen urges, sipping from her glass of wine. </p><p>Agatha glares at her and presses answer. </p><p>"Hi, babe, everything okay?"</p><p>"<em>Agatha? Where are you?</em>"</p><p>"The White Tail, with Jen. I sent you a message."</p><p>"<em>No, I got that but why didn't you come home?</em>"</p><p>"I think that's pretty self-explanatory," she rolls her eyes and Jen narrows hers, listening in on Agatha's side of the conversation. </p><p>"<em>Why didn't you invite me?</em>"</p><p>"Because you hate the White Tail." Agatha shakes her head and Jen rolls her eyes this time. </p><p>"<em>Yeah but if you invited me I could have told you I wanted you home. It's been a really long day, I need you.</em>"</p><p>Agatha sighs deeply and makes eye contact with Jen for a moment. The other woman shakes her head, urging her to wrap up the call. </p><p>"Babe," she tries a different approach. "I haven't seen Jen in a long time, it'll be a couple hours and I'll be home." </p><p>She hates the pleading note in her voice, it feels like she's talking to a child.</p><p>"<em>Agatha, I just had the worst day. I want to be home with my mate. Jen can see you any time, <strong>I</strong> need you right now.</em>"</p><p>Agatha taps her fingers on the table, irritation flaring in her chest. </p><p>"You could come here?" She suggests, giving it one last attempt.</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>," his voice is rigid now. "<em>Come home. Please.</em>"</p><p>She wants to scream but settles for grinding her molars together and swallowing her selfishness. He's right in a way, it was a bad day for his company and she should be a good mate when he asks for her specifically. If he needs her, she should go. </p><p>"Fine. I'll see you at home." She hangs up before he replies and tosses her phone on the table with a clatter. </p><p>"That was a record. Ten whole minutes of hanging out," Jen comments, giving Agatha a side glance and pressing her lips together in disapproval.</p><p>"Sorry," Agatha mutters, tossing a few bills on the table. </p><p>She grabs her coat and her purse but Jen catches her wrist before she steps out to leave. </p><p>"Are you okay?" </p><p>Jen's gaze is heavy with unspoken questions and Agatha can't look for too long, not sure she's able to answer right now without letting her current exasperation seep into her response. </p><p>"Yeah, of course," she scoffs, brushing her hair back over her shoulders. "Just bad timing. I'll catch up with you soon."</p><p>Agatha slips from Jen's grasp, feeling eyes on her back when she walks out the door.</p><p>Jen simply doesn't understand. She's been single save for a few flings here and there, so she can't understand the pull Agatha feels toward her mate and how much it <em>itches</em> when she tries to push back. </p><p>If Ralph gets extra needy she feels it like tingles spreading across her body, lighting up her nerves and urging her to comfort and appease until her alpha's needs are met. </p><p>She feels it now, tickling between her shoulders and making her hackles rise. She knows it's only a biological function but she can't help but hate the control her body has over her life as an omega. </p><p>Agatha craves freedom while her body craves submission. It makes her feel like a stranger in her skin, subject to whims outside her own at any given time. </p><p>Sometimes she thinks it's too much to give to one alpha but unless she wants to become a social pariah, going unclaimed is not an option.</p><p>The car pulls smoothly into her driveway and she parks. The lights are already off downstairs meaning Ralph must be upstairs, so she lets herself in and heads straight up to their room, easily tracking his scent. </p><p>"Hey," she greets from the doorway. He's already changed for bed and scrolling on his phone, TV on and playing a sitcom rerun on low volume.</p><p>He looks up from his phone and nods to her. "Hi."</p><p>His scent permeates the room, spiced tobacco edging on burnt black pepper.</p><p>Agatha winces internally but continues getting ready for bed, washing her face and brushing her teeth quickly so he won't get more upset and slipping into bed next to him. </p><p>"You okay?" She asks cautiously, sliding her hand over his arm. </p><p>Ralph sighs heavily but he doesn't pull away. </p><p>"I really needed you, Agatha," he says quietly, voice rough. </p><p>"I'm here now," she replies, volume lowering to match his. </p><p>Ralph gives a short chuckle. "Yeah, as a second thought."</p><p>Agatha furrows her brow, "Of course not, you said you needed me and I'm here."</p><p>"After you saw Jen," he corrects and the irritation sparks again, warring with her inner omega telling her to fix his mood and make him feel better. She knows it isn't fair, what else could she have done but come home right away? But a deep instinct, whether human-inflicted or omega made, questions her anger. </p><p>She didn't call him, didn't think of him, wasn't considerate enough to remember he was having a bad day. She's a selfish mate, rejecting the instinct to nurture in favor of her own desires. She has to fix the hurt she's caused, her omega whining in pain at the thought of being the source of her alpha's upset. </p><p>"I'm sorry," she whispers, squeezing his arm to try and communicate her sincerity and he tenses the muscle beneath her hand. </p><p>"I just feel like I'm doing so much for us," he sighs, "and I want to know you're with me."</p><p>Ralph's eyes water and her omega nearly howls in despair, prompting Agatha to lift her hand to his face, cradling his cheek in her palm </p><p>"I am," she promises.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I should have come home." Agatha brushes her thumb over his cheekbone, trying to calm him with her scent. "What can I do?"</p><p>It seems to work when Ralph relaxes and lifts his hand to cover hers and turns his head to kiss her palm. </p><p>"Let's go to bed," he gives her a wan smile and reaches for the lamp to twist the switch off, bathing the room in the light of the TV and throwing shadows on the walls.</p><p>Agatha slips under the covers and turns over, facing her back to him and biting her bottom lip, her emotions still roiling in her chest and throat, fighting to express her thoughts yet contain her omega who wants to continue pushing until she can do something to help.</p><p>Ralph's hand slips over her stomach and the omega stifles a whimper. He pulls her back against him, hand travelling to a breast and squeezing, making Agatha yelp while her omega whines happily.</p><p>This is something she can do. This is what he wants from her and the omega wants to please him so eagerly she can feel herself growing wet, anticipating her mate's cock.</p><p>"Ralph..." she begins hesitantly, cut off when she feels his other hand pushing her sleep shorts down toward her knees. </p><p>Her nipples harden under his fingers and she can feel him rubbing against her ass, pulling a reluctant groan from her chest. </p><p>Agatha reaches back, putting a hand on his hip to stall him for a moment. </p><p>"Baby, talk to me..." she pleads.</p><p>"Agatha," he groans behind her, pushing his cock against the seam of her thighs, trying to coax them apart. "I missed you," he sighs.</p><p>Her bottom lip is caught between her teeth, eyes squeezing shut when she feels the slickness between her legs and the head of his cock nudging so close to her entrance that she can't resist and tilts her hips back and parts her legs, allowing him to slip inside, pulling a strangled moan from her throat. </p><p>Ralph groans and grasps her hip, guiding her back and forth in time with his thrusts. He tells her to squeeze him and she obeys, tightening around him while his breaths become shorter and more labored. </p><p>Agatha's whimpers are quiet and muffled when she turns to bury her face in her pillow. Her hips start to roll, chasing what pleasure she can grab onto before he comes. </p><p>He moves faster and she gives in to her body's demand for her alpha and brings her fingers between her legs, rubbing quick circles around her swollen clit that make her breath catch and her stomach clench. </p><p>Agatha winces when she presses down harder, desperately seeking a release when she hears him straining behind her, knowing he's close to finishing. </p><p>He thrusts deeply a few more times, burying himself as far as he can inside her cunt and spilling against her warmth, groaning through clenched teeth and holding her tightly to him. </p><p>Agatha whines and rocks her hips back, a short, sharp orgasm making her jerk and pull her fingers away quickly when her clit protests with an uncomfortable jolt.</p><p>Ralph catches his breath and kisses the back of her head. </p><p>"I forgive you," he breathes and the feelings in Agatha's chest swell with relief and regret, knowing she only apologized to make him feel better but she accepts the truce and moves on, too tired and too reluctant to start another argument if she brings it up again.</p><p>"Thank you," she murmurs.</p><p>He slips out of her and fixes himself, leaning over to kiss her cheek before he settles on his side of the bed. </p><p>Agatha gets up to clean herself and use the bathroom, changing her underwear and shorts in the process. </p><p>Her omega is satisfied now that her alpha isn't upset, but Agatha still carries a heaviness that sits just under her ribs, making her feel like she can't draw a full breath. </p><p>She washes her hands and returns to bed. </p><p>Ralph is already asleep, back to her and snoring lightly.</p><p>He left the TV on.</p><p>Agatha reaches over him for the remote to shut it off and settles back on her side of the bed. She both wants to be held by him and to push him off the mattress and she bites the inside of her cheek when a wave of self-loathing quickly follows. </p><p>Why can't she simply fall into sync with her inner omega the same way others seem to with ease? Why does she have to fight what she <em>wants</em> to do like some backwards idiot?</p><p>What is <em>wrong</em> with her?</p><p>Agatha's mother asked her the same question many times during her childhood; she had proudly, and maybe naively, stated she was just fine.</p><p>Now she asks herself the same question, wondering if she's missed a huge flaw simply by being stubborn.</p><p>The thought settles in her mind, burrowing into her subconscious and taking root, ready to question everything she's made herself to be, bringing one thought to the forefront of her mind before she falls into a fitful sleep:</p><p>
<em>What if she's been wrong this whole time?</em>

<p><em>Finding</em> a dress has never been a problem for Rio. </p><p>She smooths her hands over the silky red fabric and double checks that everything important is covered. Satisfied, she leaves the bathroom to immediate wolf whistles and cat calls from her colleagues.</p><p>This was the problem with <em>wearing</em> a dress.</p><p>Rio flips off a few of the agents milling about the hotel conference room, poking her tongue against the inside of her cheek while Alice slides up to her dressed in a black knee-length dress and gives her a once over.</p><p>"I forgot how nice you clean up," the other alpha marvels, taking in the cut out side of the red dress, the slit that travels to mid-thigh and the matching red lipstick. </p><p>"Not so bad yourself," Rio raises an eyebrow at her partner and Alice does a little spin, some of the fringe lifting and moving gracefully around her hips while her matching black pointed heels make her a little taller.</p><p>"Thanks! I never get to wear it so I broke it out for tonight."</p><p>The mid-size conference room is set up with computers and monitors, handlers and agents from three different departments prepping for that night's surveillance and undercover information gathering. </p><p>So far VersaRX is cooperating, turning over a list of clients and donors for them to sift through to try and draw even the most tenuous of connections between them and the trafficking ring they are chasing after, moving omegas over state lines, keeping them hidden with suppressants and cycle altering drugs along with a few other substances they are trying to identify. </p><p>They have agents from white collar, organized crime, and her own violent crimes unit working together, suspecting the smaller busts are part of a larger operation possibly spanning the east coast. It's a delicate operation requiring the cooperation of multiple teams if they want to pull it off correctly and make their charges stick. </p><p>So when the opportunity arises to attend a gathering of both donors and clients for VersaRX's biggest fundraiser of the year, the FBI very politely requests an invite, offering a more subtle approach to investigation that won't scare their guests. </p><p>Rio and a handful of agents posing as donors, aim to mingle naturally with the crowd, recording their conversations for playback later, hoping the available alcohol and relaxed atmosphere will loosen enough tongues to help them identify a starting point for their investigation.</p><p>William, an omega borrowed from cyber crimes, strides over to hand Rio and Alice their ear pieces, helping them make sure they're truly hidden and testing their reception. </p><p>"You both look cute! Good luck!" He gushes, giving a thumbs up to another agent on the receiving transmission end to indicate they're good to go. </p><p>"Thanks, kid," Rio grins while Alice beams. </p><p>Honestly, she would never have thought Alice was an agent if she hadn't seen her in action in the field. </p><p>The shorter alpha is friendly and focused, balancing compassion with drive so well that Rio can't help but be impressed when other agents, including herself, have gotten jaded over time. </p><p>"<em>Guests have started to arrive.</em>" Rio hears in her right ear and she looks over at Alice.</p><p>"Ready?" Alice asks, grabbing their coats and handing Rio hers. </p><p>"Let's do it," Rio nods, following a few other undercover agents toward the elevators. She uses the ride up to the ballroom to slip into her fake persona, pushing her usual demeanor to the back of her mind and channeling someone much wealthier and put together.</p><p>Her posture adjusts, leaning her weight onto one hip, relaxing her wrists and carrying her handbag loosely, as if she couldn't care less if she dropped it or not. She adjusts her face into one of disinterested neutrality, content to observe for a bit before diving into small talk.</p><p>Once the elevator doors open she's ready, spotting the small crowd near the coat check and heading over to join the bottleneck of people waiting for entry. </p><p>A myriad of scents hit her nose, all in varying degrees of intensity and pleasantness. The couple in front of her are a mix of fruit and honey while someone near her is giving humid lake water. </p><p>She sheds her coat and trades it for a ticket, entering into the dimly lit ballroom decorated in the silver and red of the company's logo. A large screen projects ads paid for by their clients while wait staff walk around offering drinks and hors d'oeuvres. </p><p>Rio accepts a drink from a server and scans the room.</p><p>"Hope you're ready for a boring night, boys," Rio mutters under her breath and zeroes in on her first target, smiling and stepping fully into her role.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha can feel a headache starting at the back of her neck.</p><p>She has been on her "best" behavior all night at Ralph's request, biting her tongue like he's asked her to and listening to him repeat the same talking points over and over with different people. </p><p>Her nose is overfilled with too many smells but she pushes through when she and Ralph circle back toward some of the partners at the bar. </p><p>"Ralph, round two!" Paul greets her husband, handing him a glass with amber colored liquor. Kelly is oddly absent from the event but Agatha doesn't ask, avoiding the temptation all together.</p><p>"And of course a drink for the lady," Paul leans over, glass outstretched with overplayed presentation. </p><p>She forces a smile and accepts, "Thank you."</p><p>He winks at her and Agatha's stomach turns while her smile stays in place.</p><p>"Enjoying yourself so far?" Paul steps closer to hear her over the music, sticking his hands in his pockets and grinning down at her. </p><p>"Very much," she lies. "You sure know how to throw a party."</p><p>He chuckles and leans down like he's telling her a secret, his lips too close to her ear and his smell invading her senses. "This is nothing, you and Ralph should come over the house sometime, I can show you a real good time."</p><p>He's too close and Agatha can only hold her tongue for so long. "I might be a little old for your parties," she smirks and takes a sip from her glass, finding the amber liquid to be a cognac though she can't place which one. </p><p>"Nonsense," Paul puts a hand on her shoulder and Agatha's eyes dart to Ralph, engrossed in a conversation with another donor who came up to the bar. </p><p>"You're still young and beautiful if I may say so," he squeezes and Agatha wants to cut off her arm. </p><p>"I appreciate that," she smiles, trying to subtlety take a step back out of his reach under the guise of lifting her arm to take another sip from her glass. The liquor burns down her throat and warms her chest.</p><p>"And that spirit of yours," he continues, pausing to dip his eyes toward the low cut of her black dress. "I've never met an omega with a mouth like yours."</p><p>Agatha's stomach twists again and she steps back fully, the smell of mothballs overtaking her sinuses like an unwanted guest. </p><p>"It's a talent," she presses her lips into a thin smile. "Excuse me, I think the silent auction is about to close and I haven't gotten a chance to look." She finishes her drink and leaves the glass on the bar top, smiling and ducking her head to avoid his gaze. </p><p>"Of course, catch up with you later, Ags!"</p><p>Agatha growls under her breath and steps away from the bar, slipping into the crowd and cutting toward the sectioned off area with donated items for bid.</p><p>There is nothing of interest to her at the silent auction but she goes anyway to keep up the facade, relieved to be away from Ralph and Paul and their friends for a bit. </p><p>She passes by some pieces of art, designer hand bags, jewelry, pausing in front of a sign advertising plane tickets for two abroad up for bid.</p><p>"I wouldn't mind a vacation," someone says next to her.</p><p>Agatha turns to look and is caught in the deepest brown eyes she's ever seen.</p><p>"Of course then I'd have to find someone to go with."</p><p>Agatha's first thought is that the gorgeous dark-haired woman before her would have no issue finding a partner. </p><p>Her second thought is that she's tired of entertaining people who feel entitled to her attention. </p><p>"That sounds very much like a you problem," she snaps before she can run the words through her internal filter, weak as it is. </p><p>The other woman looks taken aback and Agatha internally kicks herself, grateful her husband isn't near.</p><p>To Agatha's surprise, when she recovers, the woman's eyes sparkle and a smirk tugs at her painted lips. </p><p>"Tell me how you really feel." </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh, "Be careful what you wish for," she replies off handedly.</p><p>"Well now I really want to know." The woman smiles and there's a small gap between her front teeth that some how adds to her allure and makes her smile sharp and predatory. </p><p>An alpha then. Agatha inhales, trying to get a read on the woman and <em>oh...</em></p><p>All the people in the room and the smells over stimulating her nose move over to make room for this new alpha. </p><p>It feels like taking a clear breath, the scent of pine needles and fertile earth doesn't smother her like some alpha scents do, dominating in every sense, but sits lightly like the top layer of perfume, inviting her in to discover more, like leaving a door open to the outside on a sunny morning.</p><p>"Do you often go looking for trouble?" Agatha takes a little of the bait, unable to resist what might be the least painful interaction of her night.</p><p>The alpha swallows and Agatha can see the bob in her throat and how her nostrils flare. Assuming she's just been pegged for an omega, Agatha braces herself subconsciously to deal with the ego of whatever comeback the alpha might throw at her. </p><p>"Are you trouble?" The alpha tilts her head curiously, her hair brushing over a bare shoulder.</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, her defenses unsure whether to rise or not at the unexpectedly loaded question, hating the way her mind automatically responds '<em>yes</em>' in voices that echo past critiques, an overwhelming majority that drowns out her singular voice.</p><p>"Depends who you ask," Agatha's voice isn't as steady as she hopes so she takes hold of the conversation, attempting to regain her footing. </p><p>"Agatha Harkness," she extends her hand to the other woman. "Attorney. Calderu &amp; Associates." </p><p>She retreats to the comfort of corporate speak, trading value in job titles and company reputation. It's possible she might get more respect if she added she was also married to the CEO of VersaRX but Agatha detests it; feeling as if respect is offered as a proxy because of her connection to Ralph.</p><p>The alpha grins. "You should have lead with that, I'll be sure to watch my words, counselor."</p><p>She reaches out to take Agatha's hand, shaking it firmly, hand smooth and cool against Agatha's warm skin. Her mate's mark tingles.</p><p>"Amy Valdez, representative of Del Rosario Trust."</p><p>A donor. Agatha files the information away. Though she hasn't heard of the Del Rosario trust, it might be worth looking into after tonight.</p><p>"A trustee looking for a vacation..." Agatha muses. "Sitting on money gets tiresome, then?" She prods, testing the alpha's tolerance.</p><p>"Oh yeah, bad for your posture and everything," brown eyes shine with gentle mirth and a ripple of anxious excitement settles in Agatha's stomach.</p><p>"Sounds less than ideal," Agatha relaxes a bit, leaning a hip against the table and the other woman steps closer, posture softening almost in response. </p><p>"Hostile work environment for sure," Amy attempts solemnity and Agatha bites her lip to suppress a smile. "I was thinking of filing a grievance and hiring a lawyer."</p><p>Amy looks at her pointedly and Agatha presses her lips together for a second. </p><p>"Aren't you gonna ask about a retainer fee?" </p><p>"I might have access to two plane tickets abroad..." The alpha trails off and Agatha does laugh this time, feeling it bubble up from her chest, genuine and light. </p><p>Amy's expression brightens and Agatha can read the crinkle of her eyes and the satisfied tilt of her smile and feels her inner omega respond to the idea of <em>play</em>, surprised to find she is actually enjoying the conversation.</p><p>Though...she might be enjoying it too much.</p><p>When did she get so warm? </p><p>When she looks up to see if windows are open, she tilts too far and gets dizzy, blinking rapidly to reorient herself. </p><p>The fluttering excitement takes a turn, freezing and hardening like cement in her gut and she stops short of replying. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Amy asks, lifting a hand and stopping short of touching Agatha's arm. </p><p>Agatha burns with embarrassment while she does her best to collect herself.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha waves her away. "Sorry, I've had a headache all night that probably just peaked. I should find my mate."</p><p>"Oh, alright then," Amy takes a conscious step back and drops her hand though her brow furrows in concern. "Nice to meet you, Agatha."</p><p>"You too, Amy," Agatha's goodbye is cut short, her headache seeming to grow until it throbs in her temples. </p><p>When she makes it back to the bar Ralph isn't there and her head spins, making it hard to focus.</p><p>A cold sweat breaks over her skin and a terrifying thought occurs to her. </p><p>
<em>What if she's pregnant?</em>
</p><p>"Agatha?" She blinks hard and swallows through a wave of nausea. </p><p>"You don't look so hot." She's being moved, lead somewhere. The ground changes from tile to stone and wind blows past her face. </p><p>"Ralph?" She's sitting now on a cool hard bench.</p><p>"No worries, Ags, he'll be here." She can smell mothballs and feel the threat of vomit crawling up her throat.</p><p>A warm hand circles her lower back where her dress dips and the skin to skin contact is too much so she leans forward with a whine. </p><p>"Easy there, I think maybe one too many, hm?" </p><p>She can feel the hand moving under her dress now, sliding across her waist and up toward her breast. </p><p>"Ralph," she pleads for her mate, not caring if she makes a scene any more, something is wrong and she needs him. But her voice must not be that loud because the hand doesn't stop and her mate's mark itches and burns against her neck. </p><p>Fear creeps in the moment she tries to move her body and it feels like she's moving through maple syrup. </p><p>It takes so much effort just to lift her arm, her panic multiplying now that she has no control and no time to react. She wants to cry, she might be already for all she knows, and she wants her mate, instinct reaching out to him for protection. </p><p>"Agatha?" Again, her name but different. Feminine. The crushing weight is withdrawn, leaving her unsteady until smooth, cool hands brace her shoulders. </p><p>"You two know each other?" Agatha can't answer, her tongue weighed down, but she doesn't need to. </p><p>"Yeah, she's my attorney. Are you her mate?" Pine and earth. Agatha sighs and lets her head loll forward, falling onto a cool shoulder. It feels good against her feverish skin.</p><p>"Uh, no, I know him. Found her like this and haven't had a chance to look for him yet." </p><p>"Can you find him? I'll stay with her."</p><p><em>Yes</em>, Agatha thinks. <em>Stay</em>.</p><p>The skin beneath her cheek is soft and inviting and Agatha rubs her face against the shoulder, humming when soft hair tickles her nose. </p><p>"You're safe," she hears, goosebumps rising over her back and arms. "Do you want to go to a hospital?" </p><p>"Home," she slurs, burrowing further into the comfortable shelter she's found.</p><p>"Okay...okay, Agatha." A hand strokes the back of her head and she melts into the touch. </p><p>"Agatha? What's going on?" More voices and she's pulled away from her sanctuary, whining in protest. She just wants to sleep away whatever this is and deal with the hangover tomorrow. </p><p>"Too much to drink I think," a deep voice replies.</p><p>"Has she had much tonight?" </p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p>Agatha groans in complaint, <em>too loud</em>, she thinks.</p><p>"Amy Valdez. I'm a friend of Agatha's."</p><p>"Well, thank you for your help but I've got it from here."</p><p>Agatha feels like she's moving forward, pulled by a current that she has no power over but no will to resist. There's cold and the sound of cars and a solid presence beside her that her omega recognizes as her mate. She can feel him breathing where she's pressed against him but the tobacco scent isn't what she wants right now and when she leans into him his shirt is scratchy and rough.</p><p>The moment she's lowered into a car seat and the doors shut, blocking the outside noise, Agatha closes her eyes and falls into blissful black unconsciousness. </p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio can't do much while she's undercover. She also didn't witness anything first hand but she has worked enough cases to recognize when someone's been drugged. </p><p>Meeting the omega triggered something in her, a nugget of interest tossed toward her that she couldn't ignore, her alpha perking with interest once Agatha's scent reached her nose. </p><p>Not overly sweet but a citrus, maybe orange blossom, tinted smell that made Rio's mouth water and her fingertips tingle. </p><p>She had to swallow to clear her senses but the omega's scent only filled her nose again, insistent and tempting, drawing her in like a siren, helpless to the lure.</p><p>There is something else there though that doesnt match with her smell, like Agatha just walked through the smoking section of an airport, ash clinging to her like an after thought.</p><p>Her eyes skimmed the pale skin of her neck, catching on the mating mark that made her inner alpha bear its teeth. That would explain it. She was smelling her mate's overlaying claim.</p><p>But then Agatha asked her if she often sought out trouble and her inner alpha rejoiced, ready to bounce around and play with the snappy omega, trying to coax her into a game of chase like an eager puppy, surprising even Rio with her reaction.</p><p>They'd gone back and forth a few times, and then Agatha laughed and Rio felt a burst of excitement, immediately wanting to make her laugh again. </p><p>But Agatha's sudden hesitation had made Rio pause, worried she had overstepped some invisible line and she watched Agatha go, her inner alpha urging her to initiate a different kind of chase, wanting to follow after the omega, interest and concern battling in her mind.</p><p>She found herself wandering the room for a few minutes, realizing after a moment she was following Agatha's scent and shaking her head to snap herself out of it. She had a job to do but the alpha whimpered in protest, demanding she pay attention to the enticing smell.</p><p>It got stronger the closer she got to the French doors leading to one of the balconies but a heavier note of distress brought to her on the breeze set off red flags she couldn't ignore. </p><p>Rio gave in to the pull of instinct, actively tracking the bergamot and ash toward a corner of the balcony, calling Agatha's name when she spotted two figures in the shadow. </p><p>An older gentleman popped his head up and Rio inhaled to try and get a read on the scene. Agatha still had the smell of stress clinging to her but the man with her smelled akin to a trunk from her attic, still distinctly alpha but not at all appealing to Rio. </p><p>Something in her wanted to snarl at the man to step back but he had already stood up, leaving Agatha swaying until Rio held her shoulders steady. </p><p>The omega looked drunk, a complete one eighty from their earlier conversation, ticking off all the boxes off someone much more inebriated than should be possible in such a short span of time. </p><p>She remembers asking the alpha to find Agatha's mate, her protective instinct refusing to leave the woman alone. </p><p>When Agatha had buried her face in her hair, a wave of contentment and worry washed over Rio in equal measure, stealing any minute resistance she had to touching the claimed omega.</p><p>Rio's hand cupped the back of her head, smoothing down her hair and subconsciously altering her scent to calm the frightened omega. She fought with the urge to turn and press her nose against Agatha's temple until her mate arrived, the undoubted source of the tobacco smoke smell, and pulled her out of Rio's arms.</p><p>Rio shoved down a growl of irritation when Agatha's mate looked her up and down suspiciously, recognizing him as the CEO of the pharmaceutical company they were working with currently.</p><p>She couldn't afford to piss him off and she swore at herself internally, thoughts rapidly cycling through questions. Did someone try to drug the CEO's mate? Was she the intended target or was he? Could it have been a warning against working with the FBI? Would Agatha be okay? Should she tell her or her mate what she suspected? Would Agatha be upset another alpha held her? Would she ever get a chance to do it again?</p><p>Too many thoughts flooded Rio's mind and not all of them logical.</p><p>Thinking over everything, Rio decides she needs to wrap up the night, change, and go home. </p><p>Tomorrow she'll ask William to pull up what he can about VersaRX's CEO and his mate and play through the footage and recordings of the night. </p><p>Agatha's scent lingers, more in her mind than her nose, and Rio can still feel the weight of her head and the warmth of her breath cradled on her shoulder. </p><p><em>Agatha is safe enough with her mate she can check on her later</em>, Rio determines to the annoyance of her alpha. </p><p>First, she needs to check in with her supervisor and regroup to go over what information they managed to gather.</p><p>Then she can work on seeing Agatha again.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha sits in her office bathroom staring at the countdown timer on her phone, a styrofoam cup from the break room sitting on the edge of the counter with a white and blue stick poking out the top.</p><p>Not wanting to alert Ralph to anything by spending money, Agatha had asked Jen, much to her horror, to drop off a pregnancy test at her office. Jen cursed Ralph's name over the phone but didn't comment too harshly when she delivered it, even offering to stay until Agatha got the results. </p><p>Agatha declined, opting to deal with the outcome alone before making anyone else freak out, so Jen wished her luck and left her to it. </p><p>The timer goes off, her alarm cut short when she silences it.</p><p>Agatha bites the bullet quickly, unable to draw out her torture any longer than necessary. </p><p>A single line. </p><p>Not pregnant. </p><p>Agatha exhales in a rush, body sagging in relief. She shouldn't be so happy but she gives herself some leeway since she's alone.</p><p>The thought of being pregnant right now is terrifying. A part of her also whispers that it would annoy her to see Ralph so excited, knowing he would ignore her disappointment and ultimately say he was right about sooner rather than later. </p><p>The guilt of denying him his excitement eats at her, largely driven by her biological nature but she snaps at her inner omega, silencing it when she recalls their conversation after the fundraiser. </p><p>Agatha had woken up feeling like gravity had intensified overnight, her arms and legs weighted down though she seemed to have control over them again. </p><p>She tried to remember what had happened, recalling bits and pieces in flashes of memory that left her with a mild headache. </p><p>Ralph had been downstairs cooking breakfast when she got there eventually, pausing his cooking to go to her and wrap his arms around her waist.</p><p>Agatha had sighed, needing the comfort and inhaling deeply. </p><p>"Sleep okay?" He asked, voice rumbling through his chest. </p><p>Agatha nodded against him and he cupped her head so he could look down at her. "Maybe not so much to drink next time, hm?"</p><p>Agatha had frowned at that. "I didn't have that much," she croaked, throat dry and raw. </p><p>She let him go to get herself a glass of water, filling it from the tap and drinking the glass before filling it up again to sip from. </p><p>Ralph raised an eyebrow at her, "Uh huh, you didn't see yourself, if Paul didn't come get me you probably would have passed out."</p><p>Agatha shuddered and took another sip of water, the smell of mothballs tickling her memory. </p><p>"Ralph," she said quietly, wrapping one arm around her waist. "I think it <em>was</em> Paul."</p><p>Her heart sped up, adding to the fluttering in her stomach. She took another sip from her water, not sure what else to do. </p><p>"What are you talking about?" Ralph's voice went low and dangerous and Agatha gripped her glass tighter. </p><p>"Paul gave me a drink. I didn't feel drunk until after." Her breath grew shallow, aware of what she was insinuating and terrified she might be wrong but even more horrified if she was right.</p><p>"Agatha," Ralph dragged her name out, placating. "He gave me the same drink. Nothing happened to me. I just have a higher tolerance than you do."</p><p>"I only had two drinks!" Agatha argued, yes her tolerance was lower than his but she wasn't a lightweight. </p><p>"After not drinking for how long? It's been a while." Ralph finished breakfast; eggs, ham, and waffles, and turned off the stove. </p><p>"He told me I'm still young and beautiful. It's creepy."</p><p>"Sounds like a compliment to me," Ralph shrugged. "Sweetheart, you can't just call him creepy because you don't like him."</p><p>"I don't like him <em>because</em> he's creepy!" </p><p>Agatha's headache pounded in her ears. What the hell didn't he understand? </p><p>"And where were you?" She snapped at him. "I went looking for you and you left the bar!"</p><p>"I was <em>working</em>, Agatha," Ralph snapped back. "Forgive me if I thought I didn't have to babysit my wife."</p><p>Agatha wanted to throw her glass at his face.</p><p>"I don't need to be babysat but I needed you last night!"</p><p>"No you didn't. By the time I got there you were hanging on some other alpha." Ralph took a bite of his eggs, not bothering to plate anything for Agatha. </p><p>"I couldn't even stand up straight!" </p><p>"How do you know she didn't give you something?" He challenged, giving her an expectant look over his fork. </p><p>Agatha doesn't have a good answer for that other than she just <em>knows</em>. </p><p>Ralph took her silence as defeat. </p><p>"See, sweetheart? You can't just blame people for things, what do you remember from last night?"</p><p>Agatha grimaced, fidgeting with her glass and pressing it against her lower lip. </p><p>"I remember talking to Paul and he gave me a drink. I remember talking to the alpha woman, Amy." She paused, trying to push past the fog keeping her from her memory. "Then I felt sick and I was on the balcony."</p><p>Ralph nodded slowly. "That's not a lot," he pointed out and Agatha could say nothing because he was right. It wasn't much of anything. </p><p>He stood up then, rounding the table to stand in front of Agatha. </p><p>"It's okay, babe," he cooed, putting his hands on her shoulders. "It was just a bad night."</p><p>"Next time you'll stick to my side and I'll keep you safe okay?"</p><p>Agatha chewed on her bottom lip, eyes watering because she was sure about what she felt but he had so easily poked holes in her claim and he was right, she could be remembering wrong or not remembering something at all, there was just no way of telling. </p><p>She nodded her head and Ralph kissed her forehead, satisfied that she seemed better. </p><p>"Okay," he smiled. "Now go shower, you smell like alcohol and other alphas," he laughed. </p><p>Agatha curled her lip and rolled her eyes, turning to head back upstairs and shower as she was told. </p><p>In the present, Agatha wraps the test in toilet paper and pushes it to the bottom of the wastebasket before disposing of everything else and washing her hands. </p><p>At least it's one thing off her mind for now. </p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Our two faves have a conversation.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It's days worth of work to compile the visual and audio data into usable information. Each team gets a chance to run through the audio and hotel surveillance, comparing notes and observations, placing donors and clients in order of priority and likely involvement. </p><p>Slowly they carve out a list of leads and follow ups. </p><p>Agatha is number one on Rio's list. </p><p>Rio relays everything from the encounter, walking her team through footage and spoken dialogue, all agreeing the apparent drugging is something of interest that should be pursued. The question is how to proceed. </p><p>The brief conversation wasn't enough for Rio to learn much about the other woman and she tells her team as much. Agatha is outspoken and her smell is dangerously alluring, but outside of that, she's a mystery and a possible target. </p><p>It's how Rio finds herself once again dressed in plain clothes, a form fitting navy blue dress that stops just above her knees paired with a black blazer, and on her way to Agatha's office.</p><p>Deciding that building on the established connection between Rio and Agatha would be the least invasive yet most productive route, Rio is enlisted to investigate and determine Agatha's potential usefulness to their case. </p><p>The almost clinical nature in the description of her assignment belies the personal urgency that Rio keeps to herself. </p><p>She wants to see for herself that Agatha is fine. Rio chalks it up to her talent for follow through, needing closure where she can get it, especially in her line of work. </p><p>There is concern there as well but wasn't there always in every case? What kind of agent would she be if she couldn't empathize with the victims in her cases? It makes sense Rio is restless, she cares. </p><p>Rio blows out a breath and enters a ten story building and pushes an elevator button to take her to the floor occupied entirely by Calderu &amp; Associates. </p><p>She steps off the elevator when it announces the floor and takes in the large glass doors with the name of the firm mounted professionally behind the receptionist desk. </p><p>"Can I help you?" A young woman asks from behind the desk when she enters. </p><p>"Is Agatha Harkness in?" Rio's smile is friendly but firm. "My name is Amy Valdez, I wanted to know if she had a moment?" </p><p>The young woman, an alpha, Rio notes with some surprise, nods and picks up her phone. "Let me check, one moment."</p><p>Rio nods and stands while she waits, taking in the red wine colored lobby area and the abstract art that decorates the walls of the moderately sized firm. </p><p>"Ms. Valdez?" </p><p>Rio looks back at the receptionist.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness will be out in a moment for you."</p><p>"Thank you," Rio nods. Her pulse picks up in anticipation, remembering all at once how soft Agatha's hair had been and how natural it felt to fall into a protective role, her alpha easily zeroing in on her distress and acting on it without hesitation, like breathing. </p><p>As an alpha it's her position to protect and though that instinct has always existed within her, she's able to control it, reigning in her primitive brain that tells her to protect with tooth and nail, in favor of her higher functioning brain that reasons not every fight can be won with sheer dominance, despite what some alphas may think.</p><p>But the way her alpha flipped and pulled immediately toward this omega, it was one of the few times she had little control over her baser instinct and it both fascinated and frightened her, akin to playing with fireworks; beautiful to look at and exhilarating to experience, accompanied by an underlying current of danger.</p><p>Rio hears heels clicking on the laminate wood floor, a citrus blossom smell following quickly after, sending a pleasurable wave of tingles down Rio's neck. Her body turns automatically toward Agatha when she appears from the back offices, studying Rio curiously. </p><p>"Ms. Valdez," Agatha walks up to greet her and Rio notices how she folds her arms over chest protectively, her tan skirt and matching blazer fitted so perfectly it must have been tailored. Her wavy brown hair is loose, falling over her shoulders and down to her mid-back. Rio blinks and reminds herself not to stare. </p><p>Rio fights the frown of disappointment upon hearing a different name coming from Agatha's mouth and nods a greeting. "I wanted to see if you had a moment to grab a coffee and maybe talk shop."</p><p>The suspicion is immediate and expected. Agatha eyes her warily, not trusting the offer, especially on the heels of their last interaction so Rio continues, having anticipated her trepidation. </p><p>"I looked you up," she admits truthfully. "Top five percent in your class, passed the bar on your first try, an impressive litigation record in a short amount of time, and offering services in contracts, family court, civil cases, and estate planning." </p><p>Rio pauses to study Agatha's expression. The caution is still there in the way Agatha's brow furrows but there is curiosity that softens the cutting edge of her gaze and Rio can't help herself. </p><p>"I didn't win the plane tickets unfortunately, but I <em>am</em> willing to discuss a retainer fee starting with buying coffee."</p><p>Agatha seems to still, studying Rio for a moment, the corner of her mouth lifting ever so slightly. Rio's answering smile is hesitant and hopeful.</p><p>"Jessica?" Agatha calls and the receptionist's head pops up over the desk. "Block off lunch on my schedule, please."</p><p>"Will do, Ms. Harkness."</p><p>"After you," Agatha gestures for Rio to lead. </p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha's phone buzzes for the third time in five minutes and she bites back a sigh to maintain a sense of professionalism.</p><p>She had texted Ralph on her way out of the office, letting him know about the last minute lunch meeting and where she would be. </p><p>Once upon a time he had tried to surprise her with a lunch date at her office only to be told she was out. He'd been embarrassed and asked her to text him and turn on her location so at least he would know not to plan anything if she was busy. </p><p>Still, it doesn't stop him from asking a million questions, confirming the name of the coffee shop, asking her about the client she's meeting, whether they're an alpha or omega, asking her what time she'll be back at her office, confirming what time she'll be home, if the lunch meeting would push her schedule back...</p><p>It annoys her further because she knows if she tries to ignore his texts he'll start calling, so she begrudgingly replies to every message, repeating that she needs to go, she's with a client.</p><p>Amy sits across her in the booth, having chosen a cafe within walking distance populated with suits and ties either engrossed in their own meetings or taking a lunch break. </p><p>The other alpha hasn't said anything yet, sipping on her americano and seemingly waiting for Agatha to finish which only frustrates her more. </p><p>The other alpha's scent is steady and familiar, distracting her with flashes from her memory of soft skin pressed against her cheek while she tries to concentrate on typing out replies to her mate. </p><p>The scent doesn't demand her attention, it just is, surrounding her patiently without smothering, like it's insulating the two of them from everyone else, leaving Agatha feeling a little less wary of outside scrutiny. </p><p>She finds herself wanting to lean into that comfort, pressing send on what she hopes is the final text and placing her phone face down on the table. </p><p>"Would you rather take the coffee to go?" The alpha offers once she has Agatha's attention. "I didn't mean to interrupt a busy day."</p><p>Agatha waves her off and reaches for her no-foam cappuccino. Her phone buzzes again and she grinds her teeth together. "It's not work," she explains shortly, flipping her phone to read the last message. </p><p>"<em>See you at home. Love you.</em>"</p><p>She sends a heart emoji, hoping that would be it. </p><p>"Your mate?"</p><p>Agatha bristles and tries to stamp it down, it's a valid question but her defenses are already high after texting Ralph and another alpha asking more questions only sets her on edge.</p><p>"Is that what you wanted to ask about?"</p><p>Agatha lifts her cup to her lips and crosses her legs, leaning back against the booth chair.</p><p>Amy lifts a dark eyebrow. </p><p>"You're not the only one who did research," Agatha shrugs a shoulder and tilts her chin down to level her gaze with the woman across from her. </p><p>"Del Rosario Trust, relatively new, small holdings in real estate along with financial obligations tied to child and family care, the performing arts, and cancer research."</p><p>Agatha keeps her posture relaxed while her focus is razor sharp. She enjoys the juxtaposition and the way it throws others off, especially alphas, unsure if they should be comfortable or on their toes around her. </p><p>It's in that uncertainty where Agatha could usually find some glimpse of true personality. </p><p>It's easy to be kind to an accommodating omega and Agatha is anything but, so she watches alphas' reactions to her prodding and poking, using their responses to guide her own actions to either placate or rile, looking for what makes them respond. It's a natural talent honed through years of law school.</p><p>To her annoyance, the other alpha doesn't seem phased. </p><p>"Anything else?" The other woman asks as if she's anticipating Agatha's answer.</p><p>"No," Agatha answers truthfully. "And that's what's odd. No other information, no financial reports, no bios or even a listing of the board of trustees."</p><p>The other woman smiles and Agatha is confused.</p><p>"I'm flattered you tried to look me up," Amy's grin grows slowly, like Agatha has just solved the final piece of a puzzle. She reaches into an inner pocket on her blazer, taking out her ID and sliding it toward Agatha. </p><p>"Special Agent Rio Vidal," she introduces.</p><p>Agatha freezes, caught like a deer in headlights while she stares down at the badge emblazoned with large print and a square photo with terrible exposure and plain background. </p><p>"FBI?" Agatha asks incredulously. She narrows her gaze suspiciously, unappreciative of the sudden reveal and the new loss of control she feels over the conversation. </p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p>Rio takes back her badge and puts it away. "You're aware the FBI is investigating an omega trafficking ring with the cooperation of VersaRX?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha answers tersely. </p><p>"I wanted to ask you some questions about what happened that night." </p><p>Am- No, Agent Vidal, leans forward, elbows on the table and posture relaxing, so different from the polished person Agatha met at the gala, slouching a bit and holding her cup between her hands, playing with the cardboard sleeve. </p><p>Yet, her scent is the same</p><p>It feels like Agatha is wearing blinders, only able to focus on the woman in front of her and she realizes belatedly that she's reacting to her scent and sits up, the alpha's dark brown eyes following the shift and still waiting for Agatha's reply, seemingly content to wait out the silence.</p><p>The sounds around them are muffled, like Agatha is wearing ear muffs but she's postive if the other woman were to speak she would hear her clearly. </p><p>Agatha doesn't shake herself out of it, reasoning that it isn't something the alpha is doing on purpose and it isn't an intense fog that clouds her mind or impedes her decisions, it just feels...comfortable.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>"What does that have to do with your investigation?" Agatha questions, tone falling into practiced indifference. </p><p>"Following up on any and all leads," Rio explains. "And I wanted to make sure you were okay," she adds, eyes dropping for a second to her hands and back up.</p><p>"Why not tell me up front who you were?" Agatha doesn't really care, she's familiar with the way law enforcement operates but she's curious and wants to know what this agent has to say about it, whether she falls back on a scripted bureaucratic answer to handle her concerns.</p><p>"In your office? In front of the receptionist?" The agent looks at her like she's crazy and Agatha scoffs because yes, she would have absolutely hated that but she's not going to give the agent the satisfaction of confirming it.</p><p>"You didn't answer." Rio prompts when Agatha remains silent. </p><p>"Answer what?"</p><p>"If you're alright."</p><p>"I'm clearly fine," Agatha cocks an eyebrow and presses her lips together, stubborn as ever.</p><p>"Physically." Rio counters, not missing a beat.</p><p>Agatha eyes the other alpha, teeth nibbling on the edge of recyclable paper cup. "Why do you care?"</p><p>"Why wouldn't I?" Rio's brow furrows.</p><p>The alpha growls and Agatha watches her carefully for signs of insincerity. </p><p>"Someone tried to take advantage of you. No one deserves that, omega or otherwise."</p><p>Rio's eyes harden to obsidian, reflecting a deep sentiment that obviously goes beyond Agatha, speaking to something more personal and easing some of Agatha's suspicion. </p><p>The omega swallows, sensing the shift in the alpha's scent that signals her conviction and heightened emotion. Agatha lowers the cup from her lips. "What did you want to ask?"</p><p>Rio's shoulders relax and she slips easily into her questioning. "Is there any reason you can think of for someone to drug you?"</p><p>"You think I was drugged?"</p><p>"You dont?" Rio asks incredulously.</p><p>Agatha hesitates because she does but Ralph, who knows her better than any one, hadn't been worried. Should she really believe a practical stranger with an unknown agenda just because it lines up with what she thinks?</p><p>"I haven't drank in a while, I probably over estimated my tolerance." Agatha parrots automatically.</p><p>"Do you believe that?" Rio shoots back and Agatha can feel her omega growling in warning. If she does believe it then she betrays her gut instinct but if she doesn't, she has to confront the idea that Ralph brushed her off and the thought of her mate doing so...of possibly being criticized by another alpha...she wants to make him look better than the terrible picture she paints. </p><p>"You didn't answer the question." Rio gently tugs her back to the conversation, more of a reminder than a demand.</p><p>Rio's scent stays constant, fluctuating only slightly at times of heightened emotion but the overall smell stays the same, providing a steady source of comfort.</p><p>Agatha suddenly feels very tired, burdened by revelations and direct challenges to her life's choices. </p><p>"I'm sure there are many people who would want to drug me," she sighs, only half-kidding. "None I can think of who would try."</p><p>"What about your husband?"</p><p>"He'd probably enjoy it."</p><p>Rio glares at her, unamused.</p><p>"I mean did he mention any disgruntled employees or anything that might have put a target on his back or yours?"</p><p>Agatha thinks for a moment. The few things she knows about her husband's job doesn't include him gossiping about his employees or any workplace conflicts. </p><p>"Nope," Agatha bites her bottom lip and folds her arms over her middle. "I know he had some big project from last year and now the investigation. He's never mentioned anyone specific."</p><p>"Did you ever go to a hospital at any point after?" Rio jumps back to that night and the omega shifts uncomfortably under the alpha's scrutiny when she's already moved the conversation away from her.</p><p>"Why would I do that?"</p><p>That seems to get the most reaction from the agent when her fingers curl into fists on top of the table and her scent changes, tinged with frustration, pine and wood mixing with the scent of fire and kindling.</p><p>The omega's attention is caught, intrigued by the fluctuation she can sense in the woman and the odd things she seems to get upset over.</p><p>"Because something serious could have happened to you!" Rio's voice gets a little louder before she pulls it back. </p><p>"What about your mate, what does he think?"</p><p>Agatha bares her teeth and snarls quietly, reacting without thinking, which has both of Rio's eyebrows lifting toward her hairline while she remains frozen in place, almost like she's afraid she'll frighten Agatha off if she moves. </p><p>"Seems like he cares." Rio continues with caution. "He texts you a lot."</p><p>"Yeah, too much." Agatha's answer is automatic and she kicks herself internally, wishing she could swallow the sarcasm back into her throat. It's a prime example of what her mother and Ralph keep telling her; she never knows when to shut up.</p><p>Her eyes drop to the table, staring at the scribbled sharpie on the side of the agent's cup reading 'Amy'. Agatha huffs to herself and wonders how many different Amy's she's been over her career, if this is something common for the alpha and if she's always this intense.</p><p>"He must have been worried about you that night." </p><p>Agatha stares out the window, still avoiding Rio's gaze. </p><p>"Must have been." She sighs.</p><p>A lull follows and Agatha sneaks a glance out of the side of her eye at the other woman. She looks like she's thinking deeply about something, not so much interested in drinking her coffee than swirling it around and glancing up at Agatha every so often. </p><p>"Kind of refreshing how he goes against the norm," Rio says quietly, her tone shifting from authoritative to something more personal that draws Agatha back, listening even when she doesn't want to. </p><p>"Lots of alphas in his position still don't let their mates work."</p><p>Agatha scoffs at that, visibly appalled at the idea of Ralph getting the credit for being progressive when it's she who had to fight the stupid societal norms in the first place. </p><p>Later she'll wonder if it was a tactic to get her to talk but in the moment she burns with indignation at the thought of Ralph getting credit for <em>her</em> tenacity.</p><p>"Ralph didn't have much of a choice. <em>I</em> told him I would be working. He thinks it's something good to keep me busy until we start a family."</p><p>"Did you want to keep working if you start a family?" Rio sounds earnest, like she actually wants to know, interest blooming in her expression and encouraging Agatha to continue.</p><p>What's surprising is she wants to, reaching for the thin thread of connection and giving the slightest tug, curious to see what kind of response she'll get if she shows a small part of herself. </p><p>Agatha squeezes her arms around herself, tensing for a second and then relaxing. "Ralph thinks I shouldn't go back until any kids we have are in school."</p><p>"How many did you want?"</p><p>Agatha bites her lip though she corner of her mouth lifts. She does want one. She thinks she can do okay with one. Any more and she fears she'll be doomed to failure especially since her own childhood did nothing to teach her how to be a mother. But maybe, with one, she can do better than her own mother if she tries hard enough.</p><p>"We'll see. Ralph wants three," she settles for a half-truth.</p><p>"What do <em>you</em> want?" Rio asks and Agatha's eyes snap back to find hers. She feels like the alpha can read her thoughts, seeing through the perfectly constructed front she presents and it makes Agatha squirm uncomfortably, wanting to crawl from her skin and away from the spotlight of the alpha's attention.</p><p>"Have you noticed you talk a lot about what your husband thinks?" Rio continues, not waiting for an answer.</p><p>The words, so quietly spoken, snap Agatha out of her thoughts and she recoils, protecting the soft vulnerable parts of her from rising to the surface. </p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Rio studies her so intently Agatha resists the urge to cover herself, settling for pulling her jacket tightly around her like armor to defend against the pointed observations delivered with such accuracy. </p><p>"You don't answer from your point of view, you answer based on what he thinks." It's so plainly said, too much truth for how simple it sounds coming from the alpha's lips.</p><p>It feels like a challenge to something deep within her and she can't help but defend herself. "Well...of course I would do that, he's my mate."</p><p>"Do you agree with him on everything?" Rio asks and Agatha hates how easy it is for this alpha to find and pick at the edges of her insecurities like she has a sixth sense. It makes the alpha a good agent, Agatha admits reluctantly.</p><p>"No, but that doesn't mean I don't care about what he thinks."</p><p>"Not saying that," Rio ducks her head, lightly chastised. "But I'd like to know your thoughts instead of his."</p><p>It's said so sincerely that Agatha is temporarily stunned. </p><p>"You said your husband thinks your job will keep you busy," Rio repeats her words back to her. "Do you even like your job?"</p><p>"Of course," She confirms vehemently. "I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't enjoy it."</p><p>"Okay, so what do you enjoy about it?"</p><p>Agatha is stunned into silence. </p><p>No one's ever asked her that before. </p><p>Her head tilts in thought as she scrambles to put together an answer.</p><p>"There's purpose in the work," she begins. "People need advocates for whatever reason and I..." Agatha debates sharing the next part but the open and hopeful expression on Rio's face gives her the courage to keep going. </p><p>"I have control when I'm in a courtroom. Facts and evidence don't care about designation."</p><p>"Do you like being in control?" The tonal drop in the alpha's voice makes her body buzz, her omega dropping into a cloudy haze bordering closely on desire and loosening her tongue.</p><p>"Ralph says I'm a-" Agatha cuts herself off, smile dropping like she's been doused in ice water, mortified at proving the other woman's point. </p><p>She's too exposed with too little control, so stupidly caught unaware because she couldn't control her own body's reaction, lured into comfort by the glimmer of solace.</p><p>So she does what she always does when she feels thrown off balance. She retreats. </p><p>"I think I'm done with this conversation," she says coldly.</p><p>Rio sees the moment Agatha decides to run, sitting up and leaning toward her like she wants to reach for her. </p><p>"Wait, Agatha-"</p><p>It's too late, Agatha is already hidden behind her walls, reinforcing them with her sharp tongue.</p><p>"That's <em>my</em> decision in case you were confused," she snaps at Rio, a clear warning to back off, that she's gotten too close to something too raw and sensitive.</p><p>"I didn't mean to offend-" The alpha tries again, frustration building each time she's cut off but Agatha can't give her a chance to speak. If she does she'll be tempted again by the expressive amber gaze, dark as the earth she smells of, begging Agatha to dig her fingers in and take root. </p><p>"Yes you did. You think you can profile me and my marriage just because you carry a badge?" Agatha's lips curl into a sneer.</p><p>She gathers her bag, not bothering with the half-empty coffee sitting cold in front of her, and shaking her head to clear her senses of the alpha despite her reluctance to let go. </p><p>She's ripped herself out of a warm bed many a cold morning to go to work, she's forgone cheeseburgers for salads, she's sacrificed hobbies for resume enhancing events and certification...she's familiar with denying herself small comforts and this is no different. </p><p>It occurs to Agatha that she places the alpha in the category of 'guilty pleasures' and that thought alone is enough to send a shiver down her spine when she stands.</p><p>Though it's nothing in comparison when Rio catches her wrist loosely as she passes, the chill in the alpha's fingers travels up Agatha's arm and clashes with the warmth she so naturally gives off but it doesn't hurt and sting like she expects. </p><p>It's molten magma meeting the ocean; loud and violent but gradually yielding to a larger, more consistent force, hardening and creating something new, primed for growth- destruction and creation encapsulated at the point of connection. </p><p>Agatha's chest aches with the potential. </p><p>"It's only a profile if it's a pattern." The alpha growls quiet enough that only Agatha can hear. </p><p>The words strike like a punch to the gut, landing hard enough to steal the breath from her lungs. She can't take any more, she needs to tap out and lick her wounds in private where she's safe from the disapproval she feels coming from the alpha. </p><p>"Thanks for the coffee, <em>Agent</em>." Agatha pulls her wrist free and practically flees the cafe, too afraid to chance a look back.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Ralph brings her a cup of tea after dinner.</p><p>"Thank you." Agatha takes the cup and tilts her head to accept the kiss against her forehead.</p><p>"You're welcome, sweetheart." Ralph smooths his hand over her hair. "I'm gonna head upstairs." He takes out his phone and scrolls through his calender. </p><p>"Remember, we have that dinner with your mother on Tuesday and drinks at the rooftop bar place on Friday." </p><p>Agatha leans forward and puts her cup down on the coffee table, nerves simmering in her gut. "Wait, could you stay for a second?"</p><p>"Yeah, what's up?" Ralph stops near the side of the couch halfway between her and the stairs, putting his phone in his pocket to give her his attention and she gives him a small smile in gratitude for the gesture.</p><p>"Who's going to be there on Friday?" Agatha questions softly, watching him carefully and scenting a subtle calming lavender smell to hopefully give her a little advantage.</p><p>"Couple clients and probably most of the partners why?" Ralph's hands go to his hips and he looks at her expectantly. He sounds suspicious, like he expects her to have an ulterior motive.</p><p>"Is Paul going?" Her stomach turns when his name passes her lips and Ralph drops his head, closing his eyes and groaning long and low.</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>"Please, just tell me." She cuts in as gently as she can, softening her tone. She swallows and hopes he can read the pleading note in her voice, subconsciously playing submissive to his alpha to appeal to his empathy.</p><p>"I don't know, maybe," Ralph sighs heavily and runs a hand through his sandy blonde hair, shaking his head. "He might be on a trip, I don't track his schedule."</p><p>The uncertainty triggers her anxiety and a different kind of instinct comes to life; one that tells her she isn't safe. It screams 'danger!', and 'flee!', forcing her to act. Even her inner omega protests, hackles rising. </p><p>"I don't want to go if he's going."</p><p>"Are you serious?" He scoffs, exasperation evident when he looks at her incredulously, brow furrowing in confusion. </p><p>Anger prickles against the back of her neck. </p><p>"Deadly," Agatha replies, hardening her gaze.</p><p>"Agatha come on," Ralph wails plaintively. "I know you don't like him but he's harmless, just ignore him." </p><p>Ralph tries to argue his reason but the alarms in her head continue to blare so she stands her ground.</p><p>"I don't want to be near him, Ralph," she insists, digging her fingers into the armrest of the couch as if grounding herself will help.</p><p>He runs his hand through his hair again, fisting it and letting go, leaving him disheveled and worn when he shakes his head. </p><p>"You're being ridiculous."</p><p>"No I'm being serious," she snaps back, pale blue eyes narrowing and scowling while her scent turns bitter and gives away her displeasure. She can see the moment he senses it when his nose wrinkles in offense.</p><p>Good, let him figure it out.</p><p>"<em>It's only a profile if it's a pattern.</em>"</p><p>Fine. She'll break the pattern instead.</p><p>Ralph answers with his own sweetened smell to appeal to her nurturing side but she resists, huffing a breath through her nose. </p><p>"He's going to be around a lot in the future," Ralph points out. "So you're just not going to come with me at all any more?"</p><p>"I'll still go with you if he isn't there," Agatha offers. </p><p>She has no problem with his other friends who mostly ignore her and leave her and their mates to pretend at friendship. But if Paul is there she won't be able to relax. She'll spend the night stuck in hypervigilence, jumping at every accidental touch, and tracking Paul so she can avoid him. </p><p>"Okay, now you're just being mean," Ralph shoots back, angling his body away from her and rolling his eyes. </p><p>Something in Agatha roars. This isn't mean, she could <em>show</em> him mean if he really wanted to test her but just as quickly as the thought appears, her omega snaps fiercely, all teeth and fangs, protecting her mate even from herself.</p><p>"How am I being mean?!" She snarls, her blood pressure rising along with the red flush that tints her cheeks. </p><p>"You're basically asking me to choose between my job and you!" He matches her volume, movements sharper as he holds his hand out, gesturing to make his point as his alpha rises to what it sees as a challenge from a subordinate.</p><p>"That's not what I'm asking!" Agatha refuses to back down, meeting him word for word.</p><p>"Then what, Agatha? Tell me what you want!" </p><p>"I want to feel safe, Ralph!" She explodes, shouting over him to the point he's silent and staring at her.</p><p>She never yells like this and definitely not at him, and it shocks him enough to back down, his tense shoulers dropping and his face relaxing in defeat. </p><p>Agatha feels a splinter of guilt for yelling but she doesn't offer an apology, not when she's finally able to make him listen.</p><p>"Please," she begs, lowering her voice back to normal volume. "Can you just check if he'll be there?" </p><p>If she makes it easier for him to do he's more likely to agree and then they can revisit this later after they've both cooled off. </p><p>"Fine. Fine, I'll check." Ralph closes his eyes and waves his hand, dropping his arms to his side. </p><p>"Thank you," Agatha replies curtly, pressing her lips into a thin line when he turns to finally head upstairs. </p><p>"Man, the things I do for you," he grumbles under his breath.</p><p>Agatha does her best to reject the twisting guilt in her chest.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"No, no Ralph put those down! Agatha, take the plates and set the table." </p><p>Evanora waves a hand at Ralph who laughs and continues putting out the plates and utensils while Agatha takes care of drinks, pouring herself a healthy serving of red wine. </p><p>"Little busy, Mother," Agatha breathes, not really wanting her mother to hear but unable keep herself from commenting. </p><p>Evanora doesn't need a reason though, She continues under her own steam; Agatha's short comings a never ending fuel source for her mother's criticism.</p><p>"You shouldn't let Agatha take advantage of you, Ralph," her mother scolds her husband. </p><p>A flash of white heat washes over Agatha's scalp and shoulders, growing warm and putting her immediately on the defensive. She focuses on pouring drinks for them; a wine for Ralph, water for her mother.</p><p>"Make sure she does her share." Evanora acts like she's kidding but Agatha doesn't miss the undertone of truth in the statement.</p><p>"I don't mind, Eva." Ralph replies jovially, dropping into a seat at the table when he's finished. </p><p>Evanora immediately serves salad onto his plate.</p><p>"You're so kind," Evanora clucks happily while Ralph picks up his fork and starts eating. "I hope Agatha knows how spoiled she is."</p><p>Agatha brings the wine glasses to the table, placing one in front of Ralph and one in front of her own seat before retrieving her mother's water. </p><p>"Agatha is still in the room and can hear you, Mother." She interjects flippantly.</p><p>"Oh stop it, Agatha," Evanora uses the tongs to portion some salad onto Agatha's plate and then her own. "Ralph does so much for you, the least you can do is help him."</p><p>Agatha glances at her husband who gives her a helpless look and a shrug as he takes another bite, crunching quietly on his lettuce.</p><p>The three of them settle at the table, silverware clinking while they pass dishes back and forth.</p><p>"So tell me how is work going? Still stressful?" Evanora asks Ralph once plates are full.</p><p>"Yeah, still got that investigation going," Ralph blows a breath out and spears a piece of asparagus. </p><p>"It's a pain in the butt, but they'll be outta our hair soon," he assures Evanora casually like it hasn't been stressing him out at home more than usual and in turn stressing Agatha.</p><p>Evanora hums in support around a bite of her porkchop. "I hope so, then things can settle down and you can start making some grandbabies for me."</p><p>Agatha grimaces and reaches for her wine glass. </p><p>"Mother..." she warns, trying to preemptively cut off the conversation she knows is coming.</p><p>"What? Can't a woman dream?" A wounded Evanora looks at her daughter, hand on her chest.</p><p>"I raised you, the least you can do is make me a grandmother." </p><p>Agatha takes a sip of wine to stifle the low groan building in her chest. She doesn't want to hear this every time they're obligated to visit her mother but it's all the woman can focus on, determined to mold Agatha into a good omega like her. </p><p>"I told you, Mother, I want to secure-"</p><p>"Actually, we've been talking about it more lately. We've started saving and doing some family planning."</p><p>Ralph interrupts and Agatha whips her eyes to him, glaring as her grip tightens on the stem of her glass, fingertips turning white because <em>what the fuck.</em></p><p>Evanora sits up and her expression brightens in pleasant surprise. Dread spreads through Agatha, stealing her appetite and souring her mood.</p><p>"Really? Oh that's wonderful!" Evanora turns her attention to Agatha, pointing and gesturing at her with her fork. </p><p>"Agatha you have to make sure you change your diet to help with fertility. I heard salmon is supposed to be good for omegas trying to conceive." </p><p>Agatha's skin feels hot, offended at the unsolicited life advice from the woman who fucked her up in the first place.</p><p>A voice echoes in her mind. </p><p>"<em>What do <strong>you</strong> want?</em>" </p><p>"I'm still on suppressants and birth control," she points out, glare cutting from Ralph to her mother. She tries her best to stamp down her mother's expectations, keeping them low for her own sanity. </p><p>Of course <em>eventually</em> she wants a child, but she refuses to conceive as a response to pressure from anyone and especially not her mother.</p><p>"Ugh, I don't see why you're taking them," Evanora scoffs, sipping her water. "You're married."</p><p>Agatha's lip curls and she hides it behind the rim of her glass, sitting back in her chair, one arm wrapping around her middle as if to shield herself from her mother's words.</p><p>Ralph tries to laugh it off, attempting to diffuse the tension he can sense in his mate.</p><p>"That's what I keep trying to tell her, but you know how she is." He waves a hand around in the air, gesturing toward his wife and chuckling, giving Evanora a knowing look.</p><p>"Always so stubborn," Evanora titters. </p><p>Agatha's fingers curl into her side as she imagines flipping the dining room table and scattering dishware across her mother's hardwood floors. </p><p>"And always right, of course." Ralph winks at Agatha like she's in on the joke instead of the joke itself. </p><p>"Of course!" Evanora cackles and Agatha sinks into silence for the rest of dinner while Evanora asks Ralph about the family planning he's already mapped out, sufficiently distracting both of them until it's time to leave. </p><p>Agatha doesn't want to stay a moment longer than she needs to, saying a curt goodbye to her mother and muttering vague commitments to dinner next month. </p><p>The ride home is mostly silent, Agatha staring out the passenger window, still quietly stewing; arms crossed over her chest and worrying her bottom lip between her teeth until the contempt boils over and she reaches for the volume on the car stereo and turns down the music. </p><p>"Why did you say that?" She asks, turning to look at his profile.</p><p>"Say what?" Ralph asks, flipping on his turn signal and merging onto the highway.</p><p>"That we're talking about kids," Agatha hisses, resting her elbow on the edge of the window, fingers rubbing across her forehead to stave off the oncoming stress headache. </p><p>"Well we are aren't we?" He glances at her out of the corner of his eye and returns his attention to the road. </p><p>"Not to the point of making her excited about it." Agatha snaps.</p><p>The corners of Ralph's mouth turn down in confusion, "What's wrong with her being excited?" </p><p>"Because I already told her I wanted to work first!" She stares at him. They've talked about this, he knows how she feels and how her mother is, why couldn't he have just let her handle it?</p><p>"So what? If she's excited maybe she'll lay off," he takes the off ramp toward their house, coming to the first stop light.</p><p>"Except she won't, she'll bring it up more and I'll never hear the end of it!" Agatha is beyond frustrated by this point, ready to be in the comfort of her home. </p><p>Ralph slows the car, pulling into their driveway and killing the engine. He removes his seatbelt and turns to Agatha where she still sits with her head propped on her fingers.</p><p>"Babe, I was just trying to help." </p><p>"That's not helping that's encouraging!" She's reaching the bottom of her reservoir of patience, desperately in need of some aspirin. </p><p>"What do you want from me, hm, Agatha?" His voice rising the same time his spiced tobacco and black pepper scent fills the car, making her head pound harder. </p><p>"Cause from where I'm sitting I've been doing everything you want me to and you're still not happy. So what is it, hm?" </p><p>Ralph's face is red, his mouth pressing into a thin line while he glowers, unblinking. </p><p>"I want you to stop encouraging my mother and take me seriously!" Agatha cries, finally turning to face him.</p><p>"Seriously?" Ralph is all tension and raw anger. The muscles in his jaw flex and relax as he grinds his teeth. </p><p>"You want to be taken <em>seriously?</em>" His voice rises sharply. </p><p>"Are you fucking <u>kidding me</u> right now!?" He erupts, shouting loud enough Agatha is sure anyone outside on the sidewalk can hear him.</p><p>"Everything YOU wanted out of this relationship you got," Ralph leans forward, pointing his finger toward her chest. </p><p>Agatha can see the vein in his forehead pulsing and his scent chokes her, growing stronger and overpowering her resistance to submission, urging her to show her belly to try and pacify his anger.</p><p>"We got married because I agreed to YOUR terms, you said you wanted to work and I said fine, we're not having kids until YOU say so, so don't tell me you want to be taken fucking seriously when I've been busting my ass for YOU to do what YOU want!"</p><p>Spittle flies from his lips the more worked up he gets and Agatha becomes aware of the door handle digging into her back, having backed up at some point, fearful of his anger up close.</p><p>His presence, his scent, and his tone combine into an insurmountable force that sends Agatha spiraling, whimpering painfully when she's forced to submit to her mate, turning her head to avoid looking him in the eye as he continues to rant,</p><p>"Especially when you're so <em>fucking determined</em> to humiliate me any chance you fucking get! So you want to be taken seriously?!" Ralph screams, "So do I! And for once I wish you'd give me some <em>goddamn respect!</em>" </p><p>He's panting after his tirade and Agatha startles when she realizes how close he is, placing her hands on his chest to keep a hair of distance between them while she fights the urge to bow her head, moaning at the resulting throb in her temple.</p><p>She feels like she can't breathe. Entirely cowed, everything inside her says to make herself small and give her mate, her <em>alpha</em>, anything he wants to soothe his wrath.</p><p>"Please..." Agatha mews. It's pathetic but it's the only thing she can offer in resistance under his heavy influence.</p><p>It takes a few seconds but Ralph calms down and huffs a few times, breaking his gaze and leaning back into his seat. "I'm sorry," he says gruffly, fixing his jacket. </p><p>"I didn't mean to get angry. All this extra stress is making me wired." He avoids looking at her. "I'm gonna go inside and cool off."</p><p>Ralph opens the driver side door and the blast of fresh air makes Agatha gasp, desperate to clear her lungs and regain some semblance of stability while Ralph unlocks the front door, leaving Agatha alone in the car. </p><p>She forcefully exhales, choking on tears and fighting the tightness in her chest, blinking rapidly while she comes to her senses and her head spins.</p><p>What the hell just happened? </p><p>Agath inhales through her nose and exhales out her mouth a few times, her headache now a full blown pain that goes up her neck and throbs in her ears. </p><p>It's fine, Agatha reasons. It's just a fight. All couples have them and she <em>is</em> especially willful because what omega challenges an alpha? It's taken years for Ralph to blow up at her like this which is a testament to his patience. She's snapping at him as a reaction to his stress since she's never been very good at regulating her own emotions, which only makes the situation worse...</p><p>Agatha's breathing returns to normal as she continues to reason to herself for the next two minutes. Her heartbeat slows and she feels sluggish once her body releases some of its tension. </p><p>She's not sure how to fix this. </p><p>Normally she and Ralph would talk and argue and make up but they've never argued to this point before. </p><p>Agatha opens the car door and steps out, gathering her bag and walking into her dark house. She removes her coat and hangs it up with her purse before toeing off her shoes and hesitating, unsure if she should go upstairs or not. </p><p>She can hear him moving around above her while his scent lingers, back to its familiar tobacco and patchouli. </p><p>Agatha bites on her lower lip. </p><p>Ralph had apologized immediately and he usually doesn't stay mad for long.</p><p>Doubt clings to her so she stalls and heads to the kitchen to take some aspirin, taking her glass of water back to the living room.</p><p>On autopilot, Agatha turns instead to the couch and grabs the blanket folded neatly over the back, turning on the TV and settling onto the cushions. </p><p>It'll be better if she gives him some space, she thinks.</p><p>He had demanded more respect so she feels like pushing him to reconcile won't be received well. She should leave it until he's ready. </p><p>There's a weak protest from her omega, knowing she intends to sleep on the couch away from her mate but it's easily ignored when Agatha presses resume on whatever she was last watching, using the noise to drown out some of her thoughts.</p><p>Somewhat ironically, the last show she watched is a cop procedural and it picks up on the next episode, fitting a storyline start to finish into a neat forty-five minutes.</p><p>One of the lead characters has dark, almost black, hair that sweeps just past her shoulders and a slim build with plum colored lips. </p><p>She annoys Agatha whenever she's on screen.</p><p>It's not the character; Agatha just doesn't like the deep tug she feels looking at her. </p><p>Her eyes are also the wrong color. Blue when they should be brown.</p><p>Agatha's stomach flutters.</p><p>The show is quickly becoming one of her guilty pleasures. </p><p>She wraps the blanket around herself and stares at the screen, letting the show lull her into a dreamless, fitful sleep.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"Agatha...babe, I miss you."</p><p>It takes a second for the words to penetrate the haze of sleep she just managed to snatch but her eyes blink heavily, remembering she's on the couch when her neck aches in protest.</p><p>"Babe." </p><p>Agatha focuses her eyes, Ralph is leaning over her and shaking her shoulder. </p><p>The room is totally dark; Ralph probably turned off the TV. His hand slides from her shoulder down her arm to clasp her hand.</p><p>"Come to bed, honey," he murmurs, helping her sit up and eventually stand. </p><p>Agatha goes willingly, both tired and relieved that for once her omega instincts were seemingly right. </p><p>His scent changes, one she recognizes as a mix of desire and atonement. </p><p>What's worse is she wants it. </p><p>She wants the approval and the forgiveness and right now she's tired and sensitive from dinner and she wants the comfort.</p><p>So when Ralph helps her undress she lets him caress and hold until his hands grow bolder and she opens herself to him, letting him take what he needs while she wraps her arms around his shoulders and moans quietly in his ear.</p><p>It's slow and gentle, more an apology than burning lust and when he comes he kisses her, brushing his tongue against hers and leaning heavily against her until he's recovered enough to let her go to the bathroom and change into pajamas.</p><p>When she climbs into bed he wraps an arm around her waist and pulls her close, settling into sleep while it takes Agatha longer to settle her swirling emotions, exhaustion eventually pulling her under the veil of sleep, spice and tobacco mixing with visions of honey colored eyes.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The bar isn't too loud, but it's fairly busy, most patrons in their twenties and thirties and some live music that fills the spaces between conversations and drinks orders at the bar. </p><p>Agatha stays close to Ralph and makes small talk with a brunette mate of one of Ralph's friends, nursing her drink until she turns when a group nearby bursts into raucuous laughter and she catches sight of salt and pepper hair and a toothy grin of veneers.</p><p>The air in her lungs seizes and she wraps her hand around the crook of Ralph's arm, squeezing until she gets his attention, wide eyes motioning for him to look over her shoulder.</p><p>"Ralph..." Agatha leans into him and resists the urge to look over her shoulder again to track Paul, convinced she will attract his attention by staring too hard.</p><p>She watches her husband's face and sees the moment he spots Paul, eyes widening for a fraction of a second and then looking down at Agatha.</p><p>"Shit...I didn't check," Ralph breathes and a deep hurt pierces Agatha's stomach the same time a surge of anxiousness hits her and the color drains from her face.</p><p>"It's okay, babe," Ralph reassures but it rings hollow against the rising panic making her hands shake. "It'll be fine."</p><p>"I want to go home," she murmurs, digging her fingers into his arm.</p><p>Ralph pulls her to the far side of the bar and the distance makes her feel better though only by so much. </p><p>"Agatha, it's fine," he grasps her shoulders and crouches to level his eyes with hers. "You don't have to talk to him."</p><p>"Ralph, please," Agatha wraps her hands around his forearms, trying to focus on breathing so she doesn't pass out.</p><p>"Agatha, stop," Ralph frames her face with his hands and the pressure feels good and helps bring her back from the brink of total panic though her anxiety still simmers just under her skin. </p><p>Ralph is still talking and his voice fades back in mid-sentence. "...bunch of other people here, he's probably going to talk to me for a second and then get distracted."</p><p>Agatha knows better than to argue with him right now; a bigger scene would attract unwanted attention. </p><p>She can't leave either; she and Ralph drove together and he'll be furious if she calls for an Uber and leaves him there alone which also means hiding in the bathroom all night won't work. </p><p>Her only choice is to rely on her mate to be a buffer. </p><p>A wave of unease rolls through Agatha and for once her omega is silent, offering no argument and more suspiciously, no pull toward her mate.</p><p>"You're overreacting," Ralph takes her hand and rubs his thumb over her knuckles.</p><p>"It's fine, you're safe, I'm here." </p><p>Agatha nods once and closes her eyes, conjuring the smell of pine and earth from memory and clinging to it for the rest of the night.</p><p>------------</p><p>The next afternoon when Agatha gets home from dropping off dry cleaning, she finds her husband in the living room, watching TV.</p><p>"The guys invited us out to dinner after work on Monday, they want to try that new steak house on fourth."</p><p>Agatha's body freezes in the middle of taking off her coat, her nerves still shot from the night before despite nothing happening.</p><p>Paul only said hello to them briefly before he was occupied by livelier company and abundant alcohol, enjoying the attention from the little group around him.</p><p>By the end of the night Agatha felt like her body was vibrating while she actively suppressed her fight or flight response and followed her husband around; only able to relax once she crossed the threshold of her home, taking hours to wind down enough to sleep.</p><p>"I don't want to go," she answers immediately, bracing for the inevitable argument.</p><p>"What? Why not?" Ralph frowns at her.</p><p>"If Paul-" </p><p>"God fucking dammit, Agatha, again!?" </p><p>Agatha startles but she can't ignore the deep disappointment at his lack of care. All he had to do was check...</p><p>"I told you-" she says evenly before Ralph cuts her off. </p><p>"He won't even be there!" Ralph throws out the statement but Agatha knows it's a desperate lie.</p><p>"Did you check?" She challenges, unable to keep the snide tone from her reply as she finishes removing her coat.</p><p>Ralph's eyes narrow, "I'm not going to fucking check.</p><p>"Then I'm not going," Agatha replies, walking past him toward the kitchen to get herself something to drink.</p><p>"Be fucking reasonable, please," Ralph spits back, following after her. "The bar was fine, YOU freaked out."</p><p>"I'm. Not. Going." Agatha growls, glaring at him before pouring herself a glass of wine, needing something stronger than the orange juice she originally intended.</p><p>"Well you're sure as fuck not staying home!" Ralph shouts, rounding the kitchen island to stand behind her.</p><p>"Why not?! Why do I have to be there!?" Agatha turns to face him, glass in hand and back to the fridge. </p><p>She doesn't understand why he can't simply go by himself, he's an alpha for goodness sake, it's easier for him to go anywhere alone than it is for her.</p><p>He snarls, holding up his hands like he's going to grab her and Agatha steps back even though he stops short.</p><p>"Because I'd like it if my fucking wife supported me! What the fuck am I supposed to tell them when they ask where you are, huh?"</p><p>He shifts his weight back and forth and Agatha can smell the rage coming off of him, offending and confusing her omega, unable to wrap her mind around why her mate is directing so much anger at her.</p><p>"Make something up, I don't care!" Agatha shouts back.</p><p>"The fucking point is I shouldn't have to make up shit!!"</p><p>It happens quickly. Ralph's hand shoots out and slams into the fridge behind her next to her head and she jumps hard enough to drop her wine glass, spilling liquid and crystal shards across the floor. </p><p>They both freeze in shock.</p><p>Ralph takes an immediate step back while Agatha continues to stare. </p><p>"I'm not doing this right now." There's a tremor in his voice and he turns to leave, "I'm going out."</p><p>Agatha wants to ask him to wait but the words die in her throat. </p><p>The door closes behind him and a few seconds later she can hear his car starting and the sound of tires leaving the driveway. </p><p>Agatha moves on autopilot, still in shock.</p><p>She steps carefully over glass and cleans it up with a cloth and vacuum and reaches for another glass, pouring herself more wine. </p><p>What the hell?</p><p>When had she and Ralph gotten to this point? Was it really the stress of the job and the investigation? </p><p>They've faced stress and pressure before. Between law school and Ralph's aggressive entrance into corporate business, it isn't as if they're strangers to outside strain and certainly if Ralph hadn't been able to handle it then, she wouldn't have taken him as a mate. So what is it now that makes it so difficult for them to get on the same page?</p><p>When Agatha sits on the couch she realizes she's shaking and puts the glass down on the coffee table. </p><p>What does she even do in this situation?</p><p>Tears blur her vision and she blinks rapidly, swiping at them before they can fall. </p><p>When did her marriage slip out of her control?</p><p>Agatha changes the channel on the TV, needing the noise to distract her and desperately tries to focus on the next three episodes on the cooking channel.</p><p>She glances at her bag and thinks she should text him. He left angry, and though they're fighting she doesn't want anything terrible to happen to him because he's upset. </p><p>At the same time she doesn't want to upset him more if she texts and he's not ready to hear from her.</p><p>Her instincts give her no guidance. Her omega is defeated and upset, unsure how to help her mate and sulking without her alpha's approval.</p><p>She ends up doing nothing. Just waiting for Ralph to come home; stuck in a reluctant vigil held between her and the glow of the television, stewing in her thoughts, cycling the same feelings of distress, frustration, and worry over and over until she disassociates enough to fall into a light slumber. </p><p>It's hours later that a heavy weight falls into her lap and she jumps awake, lifting her head from her tucked arms, recognizing his scent before her eyes focus and she can sit up. He smells like alcohol and she winces at the thought of him driving home but says nothing when the smell of distress follows quickly after.</p><p>"Ralph?" Agatha places a hand on his back, realizing he's kneeling in front of the couch, his upper body covering her lap, prostrating himself before her like a repentant sinner. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Agatha asks automatically. There is history between them, and love. She does care about him and seeing him this troubled, she gives in to the urge to soothe.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, babe, I'm so stupid," his voice breaks and Agatha's breath hitches when she realizes he's crying.</p><p>"Ralph..." she sighs, absently rubbing circles against his back.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, babe, please forgive me," he pleads. "I love you so much, I'm so sorry."</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes heavily. It sounds sincere and she can't help but reach out for the softness she's missed.</p><p>"It's okay," she whispers, carding her fingers through his hair.</p><p>Ralph looks up at her, his eyes glassy and red while streaks of tears run parallel down his face. She's never seen him look so upset.</p><p>"What can I do to make it up to you?" He asks, grasping her hands between his. "Anything you want, babe, I'll do it."</p><p>Now is her chance; part of her feels bad for taking advantage of his vulnerability but if he's willing to do it, hopefully it will be worth asking. "Just...please I don't want to go on Monday."</p><p>"Okay, we won't go," Ralph agrees immediately and hopeful surprise blooms in Agatha's chest side by side with relief. "I'm so sorry babe, we won't go."</p><p>The heavy weight that sits on her chest is lifted all at once and her body sags into the couch as she gives him a small smile.</p><p>"I love you so much, you're too good for me." Ralph kisses her fingers and sits up to press his forehead against hers. </p><p>"You should get to bed," Agatha murmurs.</p><p>"Come with me?" He asks hopefully and Agatha nods, feeling silly for overreacting earlier.</p><p>They're fine. Ralph is the same man she knows deep inside; he loves her and he needs her. </p><p>It's a bump in their relationship, not a reason to doubt it entirely. </p><p>Her omega is cautiously happy as well, relieved with the return of her mate and quieting once again, reinforcing the thought to Agatha:</p><p>They're fine.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Monday comes and goes and though Agatha was initially wary of Ralph's apology and sudden change, he makes no fuss afterward. </p><p>Agatha had released a breath she didn't know she was holding and felt more positive about their fight knowing they were okay now; affirming to her it was simply a bump in the road. </p><p>By mid-week she feels back to normal, falling into the rhythm of work and home and letting herself move past everything that happened to focus on the present. </p><p>And presently there is a knock at her office door.</p><p>"Come in," she calls, typing out the last of her edits to a contract for one of her clients before she sends it off. </p><p>It's the smell that hits her first, pine wood and rich earthy soil, and Agatha realizes her memory is a poor comparison to the real thing. </p><p>The omega perks up, her palms suddenly clammy when Agatha remembers the last time she spoke to the agent who steps into her office holding a coffee and a paper bag.</p><p>She closes the door behind her and Agatha's pulse jumps for reasons she can't explain but make her nervous. </p><p>Her grey suit fits her well, cutting inward at her waist to give some shape while the pants are wide legs, nearly brushing the ground if not for the pointed- toe heels she wears, making her a few inches taller. </p><p>"Can I help you?" Agatha asks evenly, pausing her work. She wouldn't be able to concentrate anyway.</p><p>Rio steps forward and places the cup and paper bag on her desk, Agatha eyes the items like they might bite her and looks up at the agent, arching an eyebrow in question.</p><p>The alpha ducks her head and sticks her hands in her pockets, fidgeting a bit and Agatha is surprised by the lack of interrogation. </p><p>"Not official business," Rio explains. "I..." she starts and hesitates and Agatha is interested now because what, outside of her investigation, would bring the young agent to her office in such a manner. </p><p>"I wanted to apologize," she continues, lifting her amber eyes to Agatha's who is struck by the obvious sincerity. </p><p>"You were right, it wasn't my place to say anything about your relationship." Rio gives her a strained smile. "Badge or no."</p><p>Agatha isn't sure what to do, of all the things she expected, an apology wasn't one of them. </p><p>She mentally fumbles for something to say.</p><p>Rio keeps talking as Agatha's brain short circuits. "I really do hope you're safe, Agatha." </p><p>"You deserve to have everything you want."</p><p>Something in Agatha's chest squeezes and she inhales sharply to feel her lungs move while they catch up with her racing heartbeat. </p><p>Rio turns slowly, having said her piece and looking for all intent and purposes like she's about to leave.</p><p>Agatha feels another kind of longing take hold, like she's underwater and reaching for the surface, desperate for another hand to grasp hers and help lift her above the waves keeping her submerged.</p><p>"Wait," Agatha croaks and clears her throat, attempting to unstick the questions and thoughts fighting for priority in her mind. She realizes she's been thrown off balance but whether it's because of the agent's scent or the sincerity of her words, Agatha isn't sure. But instead of panicking at the loss of control, Agatha is only curious.</p><p>Her own voice echoes in her head from weeks ago. </p><p>"<em>Stay</em>."</p><p>Rio stops when Agatha speaks and half turns, her expression softly questioning without suspicion, just a casual openness that Agatha cannot fathom offering to anyone else the way Rio so easily offers it to her. </p><p>"I...What is this?" Agatha spits out. For fuck's sake she's an attorney, she mentally shakes herself, mildly annoyed that she can command a courtroom but not a simple conversation.</p><p>Rio's brow lifts and she turns to face Agatha fully, scratching the back of her neck self consciously while Agatha inhales reflexively to take in her scent again. </p><p>"Cappuccino no foam?" Rio's reply is hesitant, </p><p>"And a chocolate croissant. But I kind of made an educated guess since you were looking at them last time." </p><p>Rio's confidence wavers, worrying she over stepped.</p><p>"I don't drink dairy." Agatha answers. Again, she knows she is much more eloquent than this but something about Rio's vulnerability triggers her own, disabling the filter between mind and mouth.</p><p>"It's almond milk," Rio corrects. "Did I remember it wrong?" </p><p>She blushes and her scent grows warm. Agatha blinks, her own warmth rising up her neck because no; the agent had remembered perfectly, even down to Agatha eyeing and ultimately deciding against the chocolate croissant. </p><p>The small gesture is almost embarrassing in it's intimacy.</p><p>"I already ordered my lunch from downstairs," Agatha blurts out.</p><p>"Oh." Rio's face drops a bit and Agatha feels the familiar instinctual urge to fix it. "Well you don't have to eat it I-"</p><p>"It's a club sandwich. I never finish it," Agatha interjects. Her inner omega pays cautious attention to the alpha, unsure if she wants the agent to stay or go, equally confused by the swirling thoughts surrounding her presence. </p><p>"Uh..." Rio looks confused, trying to decipher why Agatha is telling her this.</p><p>"Would you..." Agatha presses her lips in a thin line. If she asks for what she wants she feels vulnerable. If she doesn't ask then she keeps her power, but ultimately loses when she wants the agent to stay.</p><p>Rio seems to sense some of her inner turmoil and her expression morphs from one of confusion to recognition, like she's just figured out the answer to a riddle. Agatha feels the red flush creeping toward her cheeks. </p><p>"Are you on your way to lunch?"</p><p>"Sort of, I wanted to drop that off first." Rio nods to the coffee and croissant on her desk.</p><p>Her eyes crinkle at the outer corners; that stupid smirk back and tugging deeply at Agatha's gut, her omega whining internally. </p><p>"But if you're offering, it'd save me some time to eat here and head back to work..."</p><p>There is a hint of unspoken understanding in the way Rio speaks. Her slim frame turns back toward Agatha, doe-eyed gaze reading the omega well enough to phrase Agatha's request as a favor to the agent and still leave room for refusal. </p><p>Agatha feels that same exposure she felt at the cafe but she resists the urge to go on the defensive when she reasons with her inner omega that this alpha is not a threat. </p><p>Yet. Maybe not in the way she thinks...</p><p>"Since it's more convenient," Agatha waves to one of the chairs at the small conference table in the corner of her office.</p><p>"I appreciate it," Rio grins.</p><p>"I'll be right back," Agatha stands and rounds her desk, leaving the agent in her office while she picks up her lunch delivery from among the others in the break room, searching for an extra paper plate for Rio.</p><p>With some distance, Agatha feels a sliver of doubt creep in, unable to shake the feeling that she's doing something she shouldn't though she knows that isn't true. She's allowed to talk to whoever she wants; she's allowed to have friends.</p><p>A scattered wave of anticipation washes over her.</p><p>A friend. Agatha thinks about Jen who she hasn't talked to in weeks. Honestly, she's avoiding her long time friend, as much as she wants to talk to the other omega, with everything else happening between Agatha and Ralph, Agatha doesn't want to listen to Jen complain about her husband.  </p><p>More so, Agatha doesn't want to feel obligated to defend him to her best friend for the thousandth time.</p><p>Maybe this is good. Rio could potentially be a less callous alternative to Jen and she would be able to give Agatha an alpha perspective which might be helpful in trying to figure out her husband.</p><p>There's a small part of Agatha that also acknowledges she wants to be close to the other woman, drawn into the alpha's presence by the softness she extends to Agatha despite Agatha having done nothing to earn it. </p><p>The omega grabs some extra napkins and a water and walks back to her office, take out box and plate balanced in her other hand.</p><p>When she opens the door, Agatha immediately regrets having left Rio in her office, realizing her scent permeates the room, giving Agatha a head rush when she's enveloped in layers of oak wood, earth, and smoky campfire that makes her feel like the world outside her office door is gone, isolated only to the two of them together in the present. </p><p>Instead of feeling trapped like Agatha expects, it's the opposite. </p><p>She feels like she can breathe.</p><p>Rio stands in front of her framed degree that hangs on the wall, arms crossed like she had been studying it moments before. She offers a small smile and joins Agatha at her conference table, accepting the plated half of what truly is a monstrously oversized club sandwich and wedge cut fries.</p><p>Agatha pushes all the fries onto Rio's plate, she usually leaves them for Jessica to pick at later, the voice of her mother reminding her she needs to eat healthy and keep her figure. </p><p>"Thanks," the alpha nods.</p><p>Rio notices with a pointed look but says nothing and Agatha appreciates it, not sure if she can handle an accidental emotional dressing down on two fronts when she's just recovered from the first.</p><p>They eat in silence for a bit, Rio using an unreasonable amount of ketchup for her fries and managing to make it look utterly sinful when she dips a fry and sticks out her tongue to catch the dripping sauce. </p><p>Agatha's glad she's in the middle of chewing. Staring with her mouth agape would be awkward.</p><p>"You weren't...entirely wrong." Agatha breaks the silence, unable to sit in it any longer. Rio keeps eating, content to let Agatha continue leading the conversation. She doesn't look surprised by Agatha's admission but does give her full attention; her expression remaining neutral, a perfect, non-judgemental, sounding board. </p><p>"I mean, yes I consider his feelings because we're mated, but it's a balance to get what we both want." Agatha brushes off her fingers and reaches for a napkin, dabbing at her lips and wiping off her hands.</p><p>"Is it always a balance?" Rio asks, taking the first bite of her sandwich. </p><p>"It was easier to manage before his big project and promotion," Agatha admits, taking out some of the turkey in her sandwich to make it easier to eat. "But it's a different level of stress now." </p><p>"What was the project?" Rio asks around her mouthful, holding up a fist in front of her lips to block the sight of food and Agatha gives her a look, a light reprimand contained in the rise of an eyebrow. </p><p>"Sorry," the agent swallows and ducks her head. "Force of habit."</p><p>"Even if I wanted to tell you," Agatha continues, smirking and holding up her sandwich again. "I can't tell you what he didn't tell me."</p><p>Rio nods in acquiesence, letting the topic go without a fight. </p><p>"You were saying about balance?" Rio devours another fry and Agatha mildly regrets not saving some.</p><p>Agatha hums, "It's different for an omega, I'm..." she tries to think of a way to explain her thoughts. "Biding my time. Being mated gives me a huge advantage and some protection to work on my career."</p><p>Rio frowns, licking her lips and wiping her fingers on her own napkin. "That's...it feels like a failing of society that being mated is an advantage."</p><p>If Agatha were still in college she would have agreed vehemently with Rio and proceeded to go on a twenty minute rant about traditional alpha and omega roles but by this point, life has tempered her ferocity with a healthy dose of reality. </p><p>"It's what it is," Agatha shrugs. "Until the laws change or alphas in general get their heads out of their asses." She tilts her head and lifts her brows while Rio chuckles, unoffended. </p><p>"There are omega rights groups and senators and representatives introducing bills to roll back some of the obsolete legislation," Rio offers. "Seems like there's some progress."</p><p>"Wait until the real push back comes," Agatha huffs bitterly.</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>"Alphas don't like being challenged," Agatha explains though she's positive the alpha knows this, and is only indulging Agatha's explanation. </p><p>"Some might say they don't mind or they like it, but until they actually are, they don't know how they'll react."</p><p>"Has that been your experience?" Rio looks pained in the way that reminds Agatha of the glimpse of deep motivation and purpose that drives the agent. </p><p>"Mostly," Agatha confirms. "You'd be surprised how many people <em>think</em> they want equality until they're faced with an omega supervisor."</p><p>"Or an attorney?" Rio's gaze lands heavily on Agatha's.</p><p>"Yes, that too," Agatha nods and presses her lips together.</p><p>"I'm sorry," the alpha says quietly.</p><p>"For what exactly?" Agatha is only half serious. It isn't on one alpha to carry the sins of her designation but she is still an alpha and a part of Agatha does appreciate the sentiment.</p><p>"I guess I can't apologize on behalf of my entire designation," Rio smirks and eats another ketchup soaked fry. "But know some alphas are genuine when they say they want change."</p><p>"And you're one of them?" Agatha scoffs, too jaded to believe any alpha at surface level.</p><p>Rio doesn't seem phased by Agatha's skepticism. </p><p>"I'd like to think so but that's up to an omega to decide. Like you said, alphas won't know how they'll react until they're in a particular situation and you would know better being an omega."</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, still trying to wrap her head around the alpha in front of her who seems to have no other agenda aside from the one she lays out before her. It might be more of a commentary on Agatha's own character but it's the type of transaction Agatha is used to within the social circles she keeps.</p><p>Pretty words come with price tags.</p><p>"Why do you care?" Agatha asks again, remembering the non-answer she received before; her instincts tell her there is more that the alpha is holding on to and Agatha has a habit of wanting to know. </p><p>Rio opens her mouth and Agatha cuts her off when a thought occurs to her, "If you're about to say 'because it's my job' I'm going to kick you out of my office and keep the fries."</p><p>The agent pulls the plate closer in mock offense. "Are you threatening a federal agent?"</p><p>"I'm stating terms for the continuation of this discussion," Agatha replies evenly.</p><p>"Are they legally binding?" Rio raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Not if you stop avoiding the question," Agatha says pointedly.</p><p>"Now who's being nosy?"</p><p>"I prefer 'leveling the playing field'," Agatha fires back.</p><p>"Are we playing?" Rio's tone drops and the omega's pulse rises, eyes darting to Rio's and trying to decipher the look she gives her, dark eyes shining and making Agatha's inner omega cock its head in interest against its better judgement.</p><p>"Depends," Agatha licks her lips, "Make a move."</p><p>Rio's pupils dilate and Agatha feels a bit of pride when the alpha shifts in her seat. Her scent changes ever so slightly and Agatha's eyes widen just a fraction, her omega growling in warning.</p><p>The agent seems to pull herself back, pushing her tongue against her cheek and crossing her legs.</p><p>"Or don't, it doesn't matter to me," Agatha rushes out, afraid she's scared the other woman back into her shell.</p><p>"No, no I want to just..." Rio shakes her head like she's shuffling her thoughts and trying to put them in order. She offers Agatha a cautious smile, "Can I state my own terms, counselor?"</p><p>"Go ahead," Agatha smirks, playing along.</p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip, chewing at it as she makes a bunch of mental decisions. Agatha's eyes are drawn to the motion, watching the skin turn pink while a tug pulls at her lower belly. When Rio speaks, Agatha breaks her gaze, dropping her eyes to the sandwich in front of her and telling herself to focus.</p><p>"If anything I say upsets you, please don't run away." </p><p>It's the softest Agatha has heard the woman speak. Even in her distorted memory from the night of the gala, Rio's voice is always clear and distinct. Hearing it now, she sounds small and hesitant, like she's offering Agatha something fragile.</p><p>Agatha hears the plea, and nods, acknowledging the gravitas. She wants to be trusted with this, to prove she's capable of being gentle as she's handed a piece of Rio's story for safe keeping, very aware of the responsibility that comes with it.</p><p>"I grew up in Maryland," Rio leans back in her chair and crosses her arms. "My mom's an omega and my dad's an alpha. Very traditional pairing and very traditional marriage." </p><p>The alpha's voice is even with practiced detachment that Agatha recognizes in some of her own clients when they recall ugly childhood wounds. She braces herself mentally, focusing her attention and schooling her features into neutrality. </p><p>"My father was...not a good person or alpha." Rio's eyes shift back and forth, deciding where to start with so much information. </p><p>"It was just me. I wanted siblings and I know now my dad wanted more kids but my mom never did get pregnant. After having me she went on birth control without telling him."</p><p>A ripple of goosebumps travel over Agatha's arms.</p><p>"We would go to church and socials and family gatherings and we'd always get compliments about how loving and involved we were as a family..." </p><p>Agatha connects the dots, predicting the trajectory of the agent's story and feeling the dread settle in her stomach. It's a retelling of an old story that refuses to die, whose endings only lead to heartbreak, tears, and blood.</p><p>Rio sighs heavily, letting her words flow on her exhale like a wave pushing shells toward shore. "That's because my father always threatened both of us to act right. If we embarrassed him there was hell to pay at home and my mom took the brunt of it."</p><p>"A lot of it was your traditional alpha and omega role crap but I think he couldn't handle how beautiful she was so he started getting jealous and yelling about little things. Talking to other alphas, how she dressed, what she spent money on, where she went, how she was raising me..." Rio trails off.</p><p>"It got to the point I stopped seeing my tias and my cousins. I didn't really understand why, but anyone who might have talked some sense into my mother he didn't like."</p><p>Agatha's breath comes in short quiet pants; she can see the parallels but she pushes them away into a safe bubble of denial, telling herself it's not the same, it's not about her, it's Rio's story.</p><p>The alpha takes a moment to pause and swallows heavily. Agatha can feel that something worse is coming and she firmly reminds herself she promised to stay.</p><p>Agatha wonders if the alpha anticipated her reaction or if she gives the same warning to others. Did other people tend to run from Rio because of her past or did she ask Agatha not to run because she can see...because she knows...</p><p>"One day, I came home from school and I couldn't find my mom. I ended up walking in on my father holding a gun to her head in their bedroom."</p><p>Rio isn't crying but her eyes do shine, more evidence she's practiced in explaining and compartmentalizing her pain. Agatha tries to mirror the other woman but the internal struggle tears at her heart, filling her with fear and empathy that makes her want to reach across the table. </p><p>The agent's arms remain crossed so Agatha ignores the urge and clasps her own hands together tightly in her lap.</p><p>"I panicked and started crying and begging him not to hurt her. I think the only reason he didn't was because I walked in."</p><p>Rio pauses again and Agatha takes the chance to ask a question she knows will be devastating no matter the answer.</p><p>"How old were you?"</p><p>"Maybe 9 or 10."</p><p>Rage takes a place among her emotions, her nurturing instinct furiously protective over the child that had to witness such horrors in what should have been the safest place for her.</p><p>"My mom made a plan to leave after that. She said she realized if he killed her I'd be left alone with him."</p><p>Agatha nods; agreeing with her mother's past self. The instinct to protect offspring is usually stronger than even a mating claim. A mating can be undone. Blood ties are nearly impossible to erase. </p><p>She should know, she's tried.</p><p>Rio continues, voice regaining some of its strength. "I don't remember too much about the night we left. It was the middle of the night, I remember my mom waking me up and my Tia Angie taking me to a car." </p><p>Rio tilts her head in thought, dusting off old memories from her ten-year-old self and reframing them through her adult mind.</p><p>"When I woke up the next morning I was at my abuelita's house. To me it was just a fun extended sleepover with my cousins." </p><p>Rio shrugs, "That's how my mom framed it anyway."</p><p>There's a longer pause and Agatha gets the feeling the agent won't offer up any more unless Agatha asks. She's being watched again, Rio assessing how Agatha digests what she's been given, expecting her to choke and panic and the assumption alone is enough to give Agatha the courage to ask.</p><p>"How did your father react?"</p><p>Rio's face changes, expression darkening with vengeful satisfaction that makes Agatha shudder, very much aware she can sense the alpha's underlying aggression when her omega bows its head in respect.</p><p>"Furious doesn't begin to cover it," Rio spits.</p><p>"He called so many times my abuelita took the house phone off the hook. Then he started showing up at all hours to yell through the door. He stopped that when my alpha Tia Sophia bought a gun," the alpha's grin is lethal.</p><p>Agatha wonders if the younger woman had witnessed all of that too, or if she was told after the fact. She hopes it's the latter but wouldn't be surprised; alphas like that, narcissistic and egotistic, they never care for the collateral damage outside of their own image.</p><p>"Eventually he moved on once he realized he couldn't get to her. He wasn't going to embarrass himself and make a big scene and once he heard I liked women, he wanted nothing to do with me."</p><p>That catches Agatha's attention, eyes snapping up to study the other woman. Was that what it was under all of Rio's looks? She should be humble and not assume but there is always something loaded when they speak that goes beyond a simple acquaintance.</p><p>Agatha feels ashamed when she internally admits she would be flattered.</p><p>Rio goes on, "So he told everyone they knew my mom corrupted me and left him. Omega initiated divorce wasn't available yet but she wasn't going to remarry anyway."</p><p>Agatha crinkles her nose. She's familiar with that part of the law when she works within family court, consulting omegas looking to leave their partners. </p><p>"He must have found another omega to try building his perfect family with cause a few years later he asked for a divorce and an unmating. By that time he was already out of my mom's system so she signed the papers to make it official and I haven't heard from him since."</p><p>Rio's foot shakes back and forth though the rest of her is still. Agatha feels the urge to say something to fill the silence so she can put off the mental confrontation she feels coming.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she says mindlessly and Rio lifts her eyebrows and supresses a smirk.</p><p>"For what exactly?" She parrots Agatha's words back at her and it breaks Agatha out of her deeper contemplation.</p><p>"Fine, I'm not," the omega rolls her eyes. "But it's not something a child should ever experience."</p><p>"Or an omega," Rio counters.</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together. "Your mother is a strong woman."</p><p>"She is," Rio agrees. "But she didn't deserve to be forced into being strong."</p><p>"No. She didn't." Agatha agrees and locks eyes with Rio. She gets it, she does, but she can't compare her relationship to Rio's parents when there are fundamental differences.</p><p>Just because it has feathers and a beak doesn't mean it's a duck. </p><p>Right?</p><p>Rio pushes her plate of fries toward Agatha who looks down then back up at the alpha. Seems she isn't the only one who likes to push buttons. </p><p>Never one to back down when challenged, Agatha dips a fry in ketchup and pops it in her mouth and though it's cold and not really the texture she prefers, the satisfied smile from the agent makes it worth it.</p><p>Agatha blushes when she realizes she's <em>pleased</em> to be the reason the other woman is smiling, feeding directly into her instinct to make the alpha happy which makes her inner omega whine with yearning, knowing this isn't <em>her</em> alpha. </p><p>She's a little hesitant to speak, afraid she'll drag her husband into the conversation now that she's aware it's something she does. </p><p>Agatha doesn't want to ruin the sanctuary between them.</p><p>Luckily, Rio speaks first. </p><p>"You remind me of her."</p><p>The words freeze the blood in Agatha's veins. She prepares for Rio to metaphorically land a blow she knows will crumble her if Rio continues. Agatha can't ask how, she can't pull the trigger on her own demise so she waits, prey caught in a trap and waiting for the killing blow.</p><p>"Strong," Rio murmurs.</p><p>The implication is there and it's enough. She needs to change the subject, unfortunately what she gets instead is an interruption when her phone rings.</p><p>Agatha stands to retrieve it from her desk and sees it's her husband. Her stomach drops and she silences the ringer, letting it ring to voicemail. </p><p>It's too late though, whatever spell they had been sitting in is broken and Rio is standing and respectfully clearing the trash from their lunch and tossing it in the wastebasket next to Agatha's desk.</p><p>Her phone rings again, and again she silences it to at least say goodbye to the alpha. </p><p>Rio gives her a sympathetic look tinged with annoyance and Agatha feels responsible though she knows it isn't her fault. </p><p>"I should get going," Rio gives her a tight smile. </p><p>Agatha nods and glances toward the coffee. "Thanks for lunch."</p><p>"I should be saying that to you," Rio chuckles, rocking on her feet and hesitating. She lifts a hand and places it on Agatha's. </p><p>"Take care, Agatha. I'll see you around."</p><p>Agatha is hyperaware of the weight of Rio's hand; pulse beating in her ears and a simmering warmth crackling under her skin. Something about her scent must have changed because Rio steps back with a strained final nod and turns to leave her office.</p><p>"See you around," Agatha watches the agent go and looks down when her phone rings for the third time.</p><p>She stares down at Ralph's caller ID, taking a deep breath and closing her eyes before pressing answer.</p><p>Her voice is bright and concerned, saccharine and perfectly accommodating, no trace of the conflict that wars now in her frontal lobe and her baser instinct, her inner omega's foundation shaken.</p><p>"Hey, babe, sorry I was in a meeting with Lilia, you okay?"</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A week later, Agatha and Ralph are at home on a Friday night, a rare chance to stay in and spend time together between their busy schedules. </p><p>Things had been good between them lately and he even let up on her attending his events, staying home more often for quiet dinners and quality time.</p><p>It's enough time and distance that the conversation with Rio has faded though the alpha made frequent appearances in her dreams, sometimes as an invisible comforting presence and other times back at the gala, red dress matching red ketchup strung like blood across her neck. </p><p>Sometimes it was as a young girl, brown frightened eyes asking her for help and trembling just out of Agatha's reach as her mother yells in the background. </p><p>The dreams weren't nightmares exactly but Agatha certainly didn't feel great about them when she woke up in the mornings, confused and uneasy until the haze of sleep dissipates and the dreams fade.</p><p>She doesn't talk to Ralph about it. If she does she'll have to explain Rio, creating more white lies to spare herself from a barrage of questions and possible arguments.</p><p>It's not enough of a problem to disturb their peace.</p><p>Agatha is watching her show while Ralph showers and she feels the couch vibrate a few minutes after he leaves.</p><p>She reaches for the remote to turn down the volume and checks her phone and knows it isn't hers when the vibration continues. </p><p>Agatha slides her hand between the couch cushion and armrest, coming up with Ralph's phone and checking the caller ID and recognizing the name of one of the partners and pressing answer, holding the phone up to her ear.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p><em>"Ralph?"</em> A male voice replies.</p><p>"No, it's Agatha," she hits pause on her show.</p><p><em>"Hey, Agatha!"</em> The voice is genial in recognition. <em>"It's George. Ralph around?"</em></p><p>"He's showering, did you need him right now?" Agatha asks.</p><p>
<em>"Nah, he can call me back after."</em>
</p><p>"Alright, I'll let him know you called."</p><p>
<em>"Thanks, nice to hear from you!"</em>
</p><p>"You too, George. Bye," Agatha waits for the disconnect and the phone in her hand buzzes again, a text notification coming up, picture message attached.</p><p>Agatha sees the text preview and narrows her eyes. The picture looks suspicious, like flesh covered in lace. She clicks on it and opens the chat. </p><p>Her eyes are drawn first to the rest of the picture, recognizing the face as the mate of one of Ralph's coworkers. The photo is taken from above, clearly in a private moment if the lingerie is any indication and Agatha's cheeks burn with second hand embarrassment.</p><p>She scrolls up in the chat and finds more photos of other mates. Some of them with faces included and others without, but all scantily clad with lewd comments following about their bodies.</p><p>What pisses her off is Ralph's participation, reading some of his comments about specific parts of the other women but when she scrolls back far enough, her stomach drops and she feels sick. </p><p>There's a photo of her.</p><p>She recognizes the swimsuit and the background from their honeymoon, and the poolside lounger her younger self lies on, stretched out and grinning at the camera, arm barely covering her breasts from sight.</p><p>Ralph had snuck up on her while she was tanning, claiming she was teasing him while she laughed and said she didn't want tan lines before he descended on her and they made love by the pool.</p><p>She had been happy. In love.</p><p>Agatha stares at the picture now tainted by the comments in the chat group and feels white hot rage climbing over her nerves, lighting up every part of her body until she feels like she could spark a fire if she breathes too hard.</p><p>There's noise on the stairs and Agatha whips her gaze to her freshly showered mate, glowering while she clutches his phone in her hand, wishing she could squeeze it hard enough to break.</p><p>"Hey, babe? Do you know where my phone-" Ralph's voice trails off when he sees her holding his phone and his eyes widen a fraction before he schools his features.</p><p>"What the hell is this?" Agatha's voice is quiet, a flimsy dam holding back a tidal wave of curses and vitriol. She turns his phone and shows him the picture.</p><p>Ralph's brow furrows and his tone is accusatory as he fights for better footing. "Why are you in my phone?"</p><p>"Answer my question," Agatha snarls, hands shaking.</p><p>"Answer mine!" Ralph matches her anger and storms over to snatch his phone out of her hand, immediately scrolling through and tapping on the screen though Agatha can't see what he's doing anymore.</p><p>"George called and I told him you were in the shower. Then <em>that</em> came through," Agatha grinds out, her eyes a piercing glacier blue and devoid of warmth as she glares at him expectantly, still waiting for an explanation. </p><p>Ralph glares back at her, "You shouldn't have been in my phone to begin with."</p><p>Agatha reels back because she can't believe that's really what he's angry about right now. She feels violated and he's more upset about her looking at his texts? Is he serious right now?</p><p>"Why are you sending pictures to each other?" She demands. If he thinks she's going to let this go he clearly doesn't know her very well.</p><p>"It's not a big deal."</p><p>Agatha's rage builds as he brushes her off.</p><p>"It is to me!"</p><p>"Look, it's just an alpha thing. We're bragging about our mates and how you're all out of our league."</p><p>Agatha is nowhere near pacified.</p><p>"Why that picture?"</p><p>"Why not? You looked good, especially when we first got married."</p><p>"You could have sent literally any other photo of us!"</p><p>"Yeah but you're in suits or a dress in those."</p><p>"That's the point!"</p><p>"It's not a big deal! And it's your fault for looking in my phone!"</p><p>Ralph pouts and Agatha bares her teeth.</p><p>"So it's fine if I don't know about it?!"</p><p>"I'm saying if you go looking for trouble, you'll probably find it."</p><p>"What the hell does that mean?"</p><p>"It means you're making something out of nothing! It's just a conversation. They were all complimentary, you should be happy."</p><p><em>"Happy?!"</em> Agatha roars.</p><p>"Yes, they think you're beautiful even when they give me shit for putting up with you."</p><p>Agatha is shocked into silence, a million different wounds, old and new, opening over her skin, leaving her raw and stinging.</p><p>"Excuse me?" She hisses, spitting the words like poison at his feet.</p><p>"Agatha..." Ralph can smell the change in her scent and hear the venom in her voice. His shoulders sag like they're burdened by her ire and he sighs heavily.</p><p>"No, go ahead. Explain," she answers curtly, crossing her arms over her chest while he paces in a circle in front of her.</p><p>"Agatha...you know you're not a traditional omega."</p><p>Something about the way he says it makes Agatha's hackles rise. Like it's a bad thing, a flaw; some kind of disability she was born with instead of a defense she's been forced to create because of the world they live in.</p><p>
<em>"And?"</em>
</p><p>"What do you mean 'and'? You know how you are, you have to expect people will say something about it."</p><p>Agatha feels a sharp twist in her gut. That's always been the problem. The way she is. Not good enough for her mother, not good enough to be a 'real lawyer, not good enough as a partner, as an <em>omega</em>. </p><p>Not for the first time, Agatha wishes she were born an alpha. Her headstrong nature and instinct to challenge would be celebrated. Her career would be years ahead of where it is now and no one, <em>no one</em>, would be able to to take her like a possession. </p><p>"And how exactly is that related to sending photos of your mate to your co workers?" Her voice cracks and she grimaces, the last thing she wants him to see is how deeply his words cut.</p><p>"You're spinning this in all the wrong ways! Listen!"</p><p>"I <em>am</em> listening I'm just not hearing any answers!" Agatha barely stops herself from slamming her hands on the couch but she can't stop herself from standing and blocking his path, forcing him to face her.</p><p>"Agatha! Stop being so stubborn! They're just words!" Ralph reaches out for her shoulders and she pulls back sharply.</p><p>"And what do you say back?"</p><p>"Nothing, it's just a joke!"</p><p>"Well I'm not laughing!" She growls sarcastically.</p><p>"Because it's not for you! That's why you shouldn't be snooping in my phone!" Ralph shouts back, gesturing sharply at his device.</p><p>"What so I don't find your other 'jokes'?"</p><p>"Honestly? Yes!" Ralph bends down until he's face to face with Agatha. She refuses to back down, even her inner omega is silent, unwilling to fight her alpha but angry enough to allow Agatha to stare him down, jaw clenched and teeth grinding.</p><p>"Do you know how many people tell me I'm a fucking saint to put up with you?" Ralph is inches from her face, voice low, hissing each verbal jab with precision, knowing exactly where to strike to inflict the most damage.</p><p>"Or that I must be with you because you're beautiful because you're so domineering it can't be enjoyable? Even your fucking mother tells me thank you for putting up with you!"</p><p>It shouldn't hurt as much as it does but her mother remains her first wound and the deepest, carving out so much of her heart to replace it with rage and grief that she doesn't know how else to feel.</p><p>"You know what she told me on our wedding day? "I hope you can tame her.""</p><p>Agatha's eyes brim with tears and she forces her lips into a thin cracked smile.</p><p>"Fat chance."</p><p>Ralph's hands flex at his sides and his eyes darken, tension running through his body as he glares at her and straightens, towering over her.</p><p>"If I really wanted to I could make you submit," he rumbles.</p><p>Her smile drops a fraction, morphing into a toothy sneer while she takes a step back.</p><p>"You. Wouldn't. Dare."</p><p>"Relax," Ralph scoffs and throws up his hands in exasperation. The menacing flash disappears from his eyes, replaced with familiar annoyance.</p><p>"I'm just saying most alphas would have overwhelmed you with pheromones by now and wouldn't give a crap about what you want."</p><p>Agatha curls her fingers into fists, squeezing hard enough to leave crescent indents in her palms.</p><p>"Am I supposed to be grateful?"</p><p>Ralph has the audacity to shrug.</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>It's a feat of strength to keep herself from lashing out and slapping him but she needs to do something, so she storms past him and up the stairs toward their bedroom, Ralph following behind her in confusion and worry.</p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p>Agatha grabs her night clothes, pillow and the comforter, hauling it over her shoulder and stomping past him toward the guest room and dumping the items on the queen sized bed. </p><p>"I'm going to bed," she snaps, turning on her heel and slamming the door in his face, locking it just to be extra spiteful. </p><p>"Agatha come on!" The knob turns a few times and he pounds on the door which only makes Agatha dig in her heels as she aggressively turns down the bed.</p><p>Ralph continues trying to talk to her through the door. He might hate it when she argues but he's unable to handle her silence, trying to bait her back into the argument so he can have the last word.</p><p>"Agatha, seriously? You're the very one who wants honesty and when you get it you can't handle it."</p><p>"This is exactly why I don't tell you about these things."</p><p>"Agatha! Agatha, open the door. Come on, this is stupid!"</p><p>He shakes and pounds on the door in between yelling and Agatha sits on the edge of the bed, curling her fingers in the sheets and closing her eyes when her tears grow heavy enough to fall and streak down her face. </p><p>
<em>"Then he started showing up at all hours to yell through the door..."</em>
</p><p>Rio's voice floats through her mind and she gasps and holds her breath to stifle the sob in her chest. </p><p>"Leave me alone!" She yells the next time he knocks and it falls silent immediately after, giving Agatha a reprieve that allows her to exhale when the silence stretches, hoping he's finally gotten the hint to give her space.</p><p>Agatha changes her clothes, shedding everything like it's been tainted by the stench of their argument. Her pajamas slide against her skin, the cool fabric pleasant against her heated flesh, still simmering with fury just below the surface. </p><p>She curls up under the comforter even though it's much too early for her to be sleepy. She doesn't have any more tears than what she's already shed, shutting down her emotions until she's numb and staring blankly at the opposite wall.</p><p>She tries to check in with her inner omega but there is only grief, mourning the turmoil that keeps her away from her mate. It isn't a longing grief but a solitary one, feeling like her biggest protector and confidant betrayed her.</p><p>For the first time, something small solidifies for Agatha. </p><p>Her face burns with shame and embarrassment at the thought of <em>that</em> photo being seen by some one like <em>Paul</em> and wishes she could erase every trace of it from their phones and memories. </p><p>She feels helpless in that regard but she's not going to let Ralph off so easily. Not this time.</p><p>This is his mess and he needs to fix it.</p><p>-------------</p><p>It's been two days. </p><p>Two days of silence and avoidance. </p><p>Ralph hadn't tried to talk to her again when she made it clear she was still angry. </p><p>They moved around one another, never intersecting by Agatha's careful design, staying out of his reach and avoiding any attempt to engage, refusing to talk to him unless he starts with an apology. </p><p>Agatha also refuses to cook for him so they eat separately and she moves some of her makeup and toiletries to the guest bathroom to avoid him at night. </p><p>Around the second morning, part of her begins to wonder if she is being too harsh. </p><p>It's one thing to argue but another to drag it out this long. Her omega is starting to get restless but Agatha refuses to entertain the idea of catering to him the way her instinct would normally have her do, determined to stand her ground on this one thing.</p><p>Yes, she is dragging it out but he's also not apologizing. </p><p>It's a stalemate. One that could have larger consequences for her marriage.</p><p>It's the beginning of her work day on day three of silence and Agatha is already neck deep in last minute changes to hearing dates due to a motion filed by opposing counsel. </p><p>So when Agatha's phone rings and she answers without looking, there's already an edge of frustration in her tone.</p><p>"Agatha Harkness," she barks into the phone, trying to multitask and read the pdf on her screen.</p><p><em>"Agatha, what have you done now?"</em> </p><p>Her mother's voice spikes her blood pressure and she gives up on the pdf, knowing she's going to need all of her concentration to maintain her self control and not throw her phone across the office.</p><p>"It's a long list, Mother, please be more specific," she replies with a heavy sigh.</p><p><em>"Your sarcasm is exactly why you're in the situation you're in now."</em> Evanora scolds, her disapproval no great news to Agatha though it does feel like pouring alcohol on a cut after the few days she's had.</p><p>"What situation is that?"</p><p><em>"You're torturing your mate just to prove a point,"</em> Evanora spits like Agatha is just playing dense.</p><p>"Torture is a bit strong don't you think?" Agatha scoffs, rolling her eyes.</p><p>
<em>"Do you know how much that man has done for you and you want to be ungrateful because other people make comments on your behavior?"</em>
</p><p>If Agatha was close to calming down after two days of silence, her mother just reset all of her progress, reigniting her outrage like gas to a flame.</p><p>"Oh <em>please</em>, tell me exactly what he told you because I guarantee it isn't everything," Agatha snaps, barely reigning in the urge to chew her mother out over the phone.</p><p>It's a learned childhood reflex, talking back of any kind was rewarded with harsh consequence; Evanora upholding the principle of respect even for perceived slights.</p><p>
<em>"It doesn't matter, Agatha, you're his wife and his mate, you have an obligation to him and extending your temper tantrum is doing neither of you any favors."</em>
</p><p>"Is this your expert lived experience?" Agatha growls.</p><p>
<em>"See? You get nasty and push away anyone trying to help."</em>
</p><p>"Oh this was supposed to help?"</p><p>Evanora's tone sharpens into one Agatha remembers well, signifying that her mother is close to the edge of yelling and if she was physically there she would have slapped her by now.</p><p>
<em>"You know, you never have any respect for the people who helped you get to where you are. You're a selfish person, never thinking about anyone else, just what you want."</em>
</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, desperately wanting to hang up the phone and end this torture. </p><p>"Well this has been enlightening but I need to go do actual work," Agatha replies flippantly, knowing how much Evanora hates being dismissed.</p><p>
<em>"Fix this, Agatha."</em>
</p><p>"Goodbye, Mother."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha stews over the conversation and breaks her own silence that night when she runs into Ralph while grabbing a change of clothes.</p><p>"You called my mother?" </p><p>"What?" Ralph looks up from the sink and locks eyes with Agatha in the mirror, his mouth full of toothpaste</p><p>"You called Evanora," Agatha repeats, glaring at him in the mirror while he hurriedly spits and rinses his mouth.</p><p>"What else was I supposed to do?" Ralph wipes his chin with the back of his hand. "You aren't talking to me so I asked for help!"</p><p>"From <em>Evanora</em>?" Agatha asks incredulously, eyes widening in disbelief. "You really thought that would help? You would have been better off calling Jen."</p><p>"Jen's a bitch, I'm not talking to her," Ralph grumbles and Agatha is once again done with talking to him.</p><p>"That's your problem," she scoffs, turning on her heel to leave.</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>"Goodnight."</p><p>-------------</p><p>The fourth night be brings her tea while she watches her shows in the living room, placing it on the coffee table in front of her. </p><p>"Is that supposed to be an apology?" Agatha is tired of snapping at him but she can't seem to help herself. The longer they go, the more resentment builds.</p><p>"You're taking this too far," Ralph says quietly.</p><p>"Am I?" Agatha's voice goes up in disbelief. </p><p>"Yes!" He insists, taking a heavy seat on the couch next to her and his spiced scent rises, reaching for her and trying to trigger her omega instincts. There's frustration and regret and something else covered in a growing musk that makes her scrunch her nose.</p><p>"It's one thing not to talk to me but to actually separate yourself? That's cruelty."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and huffs, snorting a breath through her nose to clear her senses of his influence. </p><p>"Seems like an easy fix to me," She shrugs, her voice high and mocking.</p><p>"There's nothing to fix!" Ralph yells. "You're so stuck on some stupid words and jokes that you won't listen to reason because you always have to be right!"</p><p>Agatha's upper lip curls in a sneer, "Is this really your argument?"</p><p>"We're not in fucking court, Agatha! I'm your fucking mate, not a client!" Ralph's scent grows stronger and Agatha knows she's going to need to leave the room soon as her omega paces back and forth anxiously.</p><p>"You're right because I'd never make such a lame argument in court!"</p><p>"When did you become such a bitch?" Ralph shoots back and Agatha has had enough.</p><p>"Yeah not really convinced to come back to bed. Goodnight." Agatha pushes herself off the couch and stalks up the stairs toward the guest room but Ralph follows behind her and speeds up enough to grab her wrist and pull her back before she can get there.</p><p><em>"No,"</em> he growls and a wave of his pheromones slam into Agatha like a brick wall, halting her momentarily and sparking a dull throb at the base of her skull.</p><p>"No, you're not doing this again. You're coming to bed," Ralph bears his teeth and pulls her into him, face red and veins bulging in his neck. </p><p>"I'm sick of being punished for something so stupid!"</p><p>Ralph drags Agatha by the wrist, passing the guest bedroom and stalking toward the main bedroom.</p><p>"Knock it off!" Agatha twists her arm but his grip is tight, digging his fingers into her forearm. He all but throws her in the room and closes the door behind him. </p><p>"I want you to leave me the fuck alone!" She screams at him, keeping to the far side of the room to avoid his scent.</p><p>"I don't care! Get in the fucking bed, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha shudders, the first fingers of fear spreading through her limbs, filling her with adrenaline and the urge to flee. Her inner omega cries, grief-stricken and ostracized by both Agatha and her mate.</p><p>With the door closed, Ralph's pheromones permeate the room, choking her and settling like a fog over her senses, heavy and pressing until she realizes she's on her knees, head clutched in her hands and panting. </p><p>"I don't want to!"</p><p>Agatha forces herself to her feet and stumbles for the en suite bathroom, searching for her suppressants to take an extra dose, desperate for anything to help her resist his influence over her body.</p><p>She grabs a pill bottle but Ralph snatches it out of her hand and throws it to the ground. </p><p>"No. I'm fucking sick of you taking those things, all they do is make you bitchy," Ralph pulls her to the bed, overpowering her resistance to submission and flooding her senses until she's forced to look away, whimpering helplessly to try and trigger his empathy.</p><p>Agatha fights him weakly but when his fingers probe against the seam of her thighs and pushes them apart, she can feel the slick making her warm, as her body responds against her will. </p><p>"If you'd just let me handle it, you'd be able to manage your heats better," Ralph breathes against her neck, one hand between her legs and the other still holding tightly to her wrist. </p><p>His finger pushes inside, making her arch and gasp while her other hand pushes against his shoulder.</p><p>His finger curls and Agatha bucks her hips, crying out as another wave of arousal, rushes between her legs, her omega clawing for her mate.</p><p>"Stop..." Agatha begs, voice shaking.</p><p>"No, I've compromised and gave you so much ground to run all over me. It's time you started giving back." </p><p>Ralph looks down at her, eyes black and flashing with predatory intent, fully given over to his alpha instinct that demands he possess and breed his mate.</p><p>He leans down and sinks his teeth into her claiming mark, making Agatha scream and bow her back at the violent wave of pleasure that makes her cunt clench around nothing, driving Agatha mad with swirling, conflicting emotions.</p><p>Ralph reaches for her pants and underwear, stripping her quickly while he has the advantage and pushing himself against her entrance until her walls give and open for him, filling her all at once.</p><p>"Ralph..." Agatha moans her plea, hands grasping at his shoulders.</p><p>"See?" He grunts.</p><p>"It's better when you give in. You fight your instincts so much," Ralph starts to rock his hips and Agatha curls her fingers, leaving marks against his skin. She presses her lips together to muffle her whimpers and closes her eyes.</p><p>"If you let me take care of it it'll be fine."</p><p>Agatha wants to cry, can feel the burn in her nose and throat, but she can't, not when it feels so fucking good to have him inside her, rubbing against her walls and making him swell as he reaches his peak. </p><p>He empties himself inside her and Agatha feels unsatisfied, arousal turning to ache when she's denied an orgasm but she embraces it, guilt injecting itself into her consciousness because her baser instinct couldn't be controlled. </p><p>When Ralph moves off of her she rolls to the side to go to the bathroom but his arm around her waist pulls her back against him.</p><p>"No, stay," he orders, his voice still ringing with command.</p><p>Agatha turns to look over her shoulder, "I need to-"</p><p>"No you don't," he cuts her off gruffly. "If it happens, it happens. Go to sleep."</p><p>Ralph shifts around to get comfortable, his arm around her waist locking in tightly like an iron belt, trapping her with him while his breath puffs against her hair.</p><p>Agatha lays still, trying to control the shaking that starts when her adrenaline and pheromone-fueled lust wear off. </p><p>She cries when he starts to snore, tears laden with betrayal and sorrow and even anger though it's mostly directed inward.</p><p>Agatha had ignored every sign, insisting she knew better, it couldn't be the way her story goes, she thought she made it clear she would not submit, yet here she is.</p><p>Her tears are a steady stream now and she thinks of Rio, hears her voice in her head. </p><p>It had been obvious to Rio. </p><p>
<em>"You remind me of her."</em>
</p><p>Agatha sobs quietly into her pillow, letting her heartbreak consume her for a few moments, giving in to her despair until she can turn it into resolve. </p><p>Slowly, Agatha allows the truth to surface, facing it for the first time and accepting she has no other choice. </p><p>Her cries soften to hiccups.</p><p>She needs to leave. </p><p> </p>

<p>When Agatha wakes she's alone in bed. </p><p>The sun shines through the curtains and she's confused until her memory catches up to her waking mind, tears welling in her swollen eyes as she listens carefully for any sign of Ralph.</p><p>Minutes pass in silence and Agatha exhales and pulls herself out of bed toward the bathroom, still half-listening for him in case she's wrong. </p><p>The pills have been cleaned up from the floor and Agatha opens the medicine cabinet to find her suppressants and birth control are missing. </p><p>Agatha's heart beat speeds up and she closes the medicine cabinet, grasping at the edge of the sink and trying to think of a way to get around Ralph's manipulation.</p><p>She feels sticky and dirty so she decides to take a shower to wash his touch off her skin, taking the time to scrub herself thoroughly and come up with some kind of plan to leave.</p><p>When Agatha finishes she gets dressed quickly and goes searching for her phone. She looks through her bag, the guest room, and the living room and when she still can't find it, she grabs the cordless landline and calls her number, listening for the ringer and hearing nothing. </p><p>A mild panic sets in and she runs to the desk in their home office and pulls out the phone book, searching for the number for her doctor's office and dialing.</p><p>
<em>"Hello, Dr. Rambeau's office."</em>
</p><p>"Hi, this is Agatha Harkness, I need to refill my prescriptions. I lost the bottles."</p><p>
<em>"No problem, let me double check."</em>
</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Agatha gnaws on her thumbnail nervously while the nurse types.</p><p>
<em>"Ma'am? Our record says those were cancelled."</em>
</p><p>Agatha clenches her fingers into a fist.</p><p>"Cancelled?"</p><p>
<em>"Yes, there's a note here that says no refills on those prescriptions."</em>
</p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p>
<em>"Uh, our record says there was a request to stop medication. Was this request made in error?"</em>
</p><p>"Yes," Agatha answers quickly.</p><p>
<em>"Okay, no problem. Just one second." </em>
</p><p>More typing and Agatha has a glimmer of hope that's quickly crushed when the nurse returns to the call.</p><p>
<em>"Alright so Mrs. Harkness we just need your mate to call in and sign off as well and you'll be good to go."</em>
</p><p>"What do you mean? Why does he need to call?"</p><p>
<em>"Oh, regarding suppressants and birth control, both mated parties need to sign off that they're aware of the medication's side effects and the main purpose of preventing pregnancy."</em>
</p><p>Of all the stupid, archaic bullshit...</p><p>"But I was taking them before," Agatha snaps.</p><p><em>"I understand,"</em> the nurse tries to pacify.<em>"But we do need the documentation for liability purposes."</em></p><p>"How would he sign off?" Agatha growls.</p><p>
<em>"He can call or we can send a digital document over email for both of you to sign."</em>
</p><p>"I'll have him call."</p><p>
<em>"Great! Anything else I can help you with?"</em>
</p><p>"No."</p><p>
<em>"Alright, well have a great day."</em>
</p><p>Agatha ends the call and smacks the phone on the desk hard enough to leave a mark. It's satisfyingly violent and she does it again and again until the plastic cracks, panting lightly with the exertion.</p><p>The door downstairs opens and closes and Agatha tenses like a deer in headlights then rushes to put the phone and phone book away. </p><p>She runs into him just as she exits the office and his hands come up to steady her. Agatha steps back, crossing her arms over her body and swallowing heavily.</p><p>"Did you cancel my prescriptions?" Her voice shakes and Agatha has never felt so pathetic in her life. Helplessness she hasn't felt since childhood seeps into her consciousness and for the first time in a long time, Agatha feels truly trapped.</p><p>"Yes," Ralph replies without remorse.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because I meant what I said. It's time for us to grow up."</p><p>Agatha swallows again and eyes him warily, "Please call the doctor and put them back."</p><p>"No," Ralph releases a musky scent, pheromones hitting her again and making her dizzy.</p><p>"I gave you everything you wanted from this relationship, now it's your turn to compromise and meet me halfway."</p><p>"Stop," Agatha orders, covering her nose and taking another step back when he moves forward.</p><p>"I don't like doing this, Agatha, but it's the only way you listen to me," Ralph closes in on her, eyes black and threatening.</p><p>"I'm leaving you," she whispers. </p><p>It's not the declaration Agatha prefers but it's the first time she's said it out loud and once she speaks life into the idea it solidifies, giving her a crumb of courage.</p><p>Ralph, however, isn't willing to let go so easily. His eyes speak of malicious intent, filled with cruelty that Agatha never would have imagined him capable of, but terrifies her now.</p><p>"You're not going <em>anywhere</em>."</p><p>He towers over her, hand shooting out to grasp her throat and squeezing until her face turns red and she claws and scratches at his hand, gulping the little air she can manage.</p><p>"If you leave," Ralph growls next to her ear, "Not only will you get sick but you think anyone is going to want you out there? You reek of me and you have my mark, no other alpha will want a pre-claimed omega."</p><p>"I don't care," Agatha rasps, eyes watering.</p><p>"You really have no idea how good you have it do you? I have been so damn accommodating and that's my fault because now you think you can run all over me. I'm gonna fix that."</p><p>Ralph squeezes harder and the fight starts to leave Agatha, little bursts of light cloud the corners of her vision, terror overwhelming her as she confronts her own mortality. </p><p>"In the eyes of the law you belong to me. I could kill you and get off with paying a fine but I don't want to be that kind of alpha, do you understand?" </p><p>Agatha nods and he lets her go. She sinks to the ground, gasping and coughing for breath while bursts of light cloud her vision and her phone lands on the floor in front of her.</p><p>"Go get ready for lunch. You're calling out for the next week."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio's sixth sense is screaming at her. </p><p>She goes over the collected evidence again, text messages, transactions, bank discrepancies, verbal testimony from whistle-blowers, and confessions from arrested suspects. </p><p>Everything is solid, warrants signed and each division agreeing its time to move in carefully on VersaRX, making strategic arrests so as not to alert the CEO or partners and send them into an evidence dumping panic.</p><p>Agatha's husband is on the list and again Rio's mind drifts to the omega, no longer fighting against the magnetic pull the woman has over her.</p><p>If Rio were younger and less experienced in life she might have labeled her infatuation as puppy love but the thing about infatuation is it usually goes away with time and distance. </p><p>Her obsession only grows.</p><p>And her inner alpha does nothing to help her, whining for the omega despite the claim upon her, and she finds herself daydreaming about committing one of the most taboo acts against another alpha; touching their mate. </p><p>Rio's hands itch to touch Agatha's hair, her hands, her face, anything she would be allowed she would gladly take. She wants to bury her nose in Agatha's neck, inhaling her scent like an addict, wrapping her body around the omega as if she could physically crawl under her skin and stay there for the rest of her life.</p><p>The pull is so intense that a few days after meeting Agatha at the cafe she took home another omega from a bar, hoping a one night stand would help her get Agatha out of her system. </p><p>The night was fun but Agatha remained firmly planted in her head, stubbornly refusing to go.</p><p>Rio's eyes move over their arrest list, pausing on Ralph's stupid name. No wonder Agatha kept her maiden name, who would want to be a Boehner? </p><p>Her alpha snarls at the thought of him, fangs beared and foaming. Rio can see her father in him, clocking his cocky attitude from recorded interviews and statements collected by her team.</p><p>Rio also remembers meeting him and though she tries not to judge other relationships, she knows deep down she could challenge him for his mate. </p><p>And win. </p><p>There is no hierarchy within alphas but some are more dominant than others; and with the rage she feels toward his smarmy ass, Rio is confident she'd be able to put Ralph down with her bare hands. </p><p>"You look like you want to cause some damage."</p><p>Alice's voice cuts through Rio's thoughts and she looks up as her partner sets a cup of coffee on her desk. </p><p>"I do," Rio confirms, lifting the cup. "Thanks."</p><p>"Who's the lucky person this time?" Alice blows over the surface of her coffee and sips it carefully. </p><p>Rio shoves the list across the desk and Alice hums in acknowledgement. </p><p>"Arrest warrants are in the works."</p><p>"Not fast enough," Rio grumbles and sips her coffee. She knows it's from the break room due to the burnt aftertaste and puts the cup back on the desk. </p><p>"Would this have anything to do with the wife of the CEO?" Alice gives her a look and Rio slumps in her chair and leans her head back, folding her hands over her stomach. </p><p>"He's just such an asshole," Rio grouses and Alice nods. </p><p>Rio doesn't really have secrets she keeps from Alice. The other alpha is a good partner and over time became Rio's best friend.</p><p>They lean on one another for support and advice in the field and their personal lives, so of course Alice knows about Rio's sad obsession with the omega. </p><p>"Agreed. Pretty sure Agatha will be happy when he's taken away in cuffs."</p><p>Rio huffs, distracted, "Probably."</p><p>Alice squints and tilts her head, "What else do you see?"</p><p>Rio's leg jumps up and down with restless energy. </p><p>"Something feels off," Rio answers without further explanation. She has no evidence, just a feeling that she can't shake. </p><p>Luckily, Alice understands; gently probing at the gears in Rio's head like a gifted mechanic to get them unstuck and turning.</p><p>"Did you go see her again?" Alice asks gently. "Thanks for standing me up that day by the way."</p><p>There's no real bite to Alice's words but Rio still winces. "Sorry," she says sheepishly while Alice chuckles behind her cup. </p><p>The shorter omega had graciously bought Rio a taco plate that day and sat with her while she recounted her lunch with Agatha and maybe gushed a little about how interesting the omega was while Alice nodded knowingly.</p><p>"So what? Did you?" Present Alice asks.</p><p>"That's the thing," Rio scrunches her face. "I was going to so I called her office."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And they said she's been out sick," Rio swivels her chair back and forth.</p><p>"As sometimes happens," Alice nods, waiting for Rio to continue but the taller alpha shakes her head. </p><p>"Not Agatha," she says with enough confidence that both of Alice's eyebrows shoot up.</p><p>Rio scoots her chair over to reach for a file and opens it up though she knows the contents well enough to recite them in her sleep.</p><p>"She started as an intern right out of college, jumping firms twice before landing a position at Calderu &amp; Associates, promoted to a permanent position three years ago," Rio recites all of it and Alice waits patiently for Rio to explain.</p><p>"In all that time, she's never missed a day of work," Rio concludes. </p><p>Alice challenges her train of thought, "Is it really out of the realm of possibility she might actually be sick?"</p><p>Rio knows Alice well enough not to take offense, learning that having Alice bring forth expected obstacles or other options often helps her reach a conclusion faster. Alice isn't trying to block the tracks, she's trying to help Rio drive the train. </p><p>Rio thinks for a moment, eyes darting back and forth, mentally weighing the possibility against what she knows about Agatha and the bigger picture of the people surrounding her, but it isn't enough to silence her intuition. </p><p>"It's possible but she cares about her career and thinks she needs to work twice as hard to be taken seriously... even if she were sick I think she'd still go in." Rio makes an educated guess but she's confident she's right. </p><p>Rio's leg starts to jump again and her mind conjures a myriad of worst case scenarios that triggers her inner alpha's protectiveness, upset that Agatha is out of reach and urging her to find the omega, just to be sure. </p><p>Rio closes the file and tosses it back onto her desk, jumping up from her chair and grabbing her badge and firearm. </p><p>"Where you going?" Alice asks calmly.</p><p>"I have some follow up questions for Mr. Boehner."</p><p>Alice finishes her coffee, a testament to her fortitude, and grabs her own badge and firearm to follow Rio out. </p><p>"Nothing too serious I hope?" Alice asks as she falls into step with Rio. </p><p>"Just some clarifying questions. Nothing that might put the investigation in danger," Rio gives Alice a loaded glance. She isn't stupid enough to jeopardize months of work but she needs to see with her own eyes that Agatha is okay, even if she is just 'sick'.</p><p>Alice glances at Rio as they enter the car and Rio programs Agatha's address into her GPS. </p><p>"I've never seen you like this with anyone else," Alice points out as Rio starts the car and pulls out into afternoon traffic.</p><p>Rio presses her tongue against the side of her cheek and works her jaw. </p><p>"Yeah I know," Rio admits. </p><p>"Should I be afraid?" Alice asks, a sliver of worry peeking through. </p><p>"I am," Rio fixes her eyes on the road and Alice nods and remains silent for the rest of the drive. </p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio knocks on the front door of the large grey house, impressed by the wood and stone facade that clearly screams 'money'. </p><p>There's the sound of footsteps and a pause then more footsteps before the locks start to turn and the door opens on a smiling Ralph Boehner. </p><p>He smells like cigarette butts and Rio covers her snarl with a smile. Just his presence puts her on edge.</p><p>"Evening, Mr. Boehner. Agent Vidal and Agent Wu-Gulliver," she introduces, wondering if he'll recognize her from the gala but the blank look in his eyes tells her he doesn't. </p><p>"Sorry for the home visit but we had some final questions before we wrap up our report."</p><p>Ralph sticks a hand in his pocket and rocks on his feet. </p><p>"Everything alright?"</p><p>"Oh, totally fine," Rio waves her hand, brushing off his worry and grinning. </p><p>"Red tape crap. Higher ups will kick it back if we don't fill out everything in triplicate," she groans in complaint and rolls her eyes and Ralph relaxes his posture. </p><p>"Sounds like my bosses," he chuckles.</p><p>Rio grins. Got him. </p><p>Rio laughs with him. "It's just a few questions, could we come in? Should be quick."</p><p>Ralph hesitates for a fraction of a second then steps back, opening the door wider. </p><p>"Sure, come on in. But it's gotta be quick, wouldn't want to piss off the missus," he laughs. </p><p>Rio's skin prickles and she struggles to control her stronger emotions, not wanting her scent to give away her true feelings. </p><p>"Heaven forbid," she mutters, she and Alice taking a seat on the chairs opposite the couch where Ralph sits. </p><p>"So," he leans forward, elbows on his knees and spreads his hands out. "What can I answer for you?"</p><p>"We just wanted to confirm the numbers on VersaRX's yearly income report for the last two years," Rio starts, discretely taking in the details of the surrounding living room.</p><p>"No problem," Ralph nods and starts reciting numbers and quarterly reports but Rio is only half-listening when she finally detects the scent of citrus blossoms and lavender. </p><p>Agatha comes down the stairs and Rio sees her freeze at the bottom when Agatha spots her, her mouth dropping open in shock before she fixes her expression and drops her eyes. </p><p>Rio notices the bags under Agatha's eyes and the sallow dip of her cheeks and though she is still beautiful, she does look ill. </p><p>The black turtleneck sweater is a little baggy and hangs down over a worn pair of jeans. It's the most dressed down Rio has seen the omega and her chest clenches with want.</p><p>"Agatha, honey," Ralph waves her over when he notices her and the steps she takes look weighted as she makes her way to his side. </p><p>"Agents, this is my mate and wife, Agatha," he introduces proudly and Rio avoids looking at Alice lest her face gives something away.</p><p>"Nice to meet you," Rio and Alice acknowledge the omega who avoids their eyes again, driving Rio's alpha insane.</p><p>She wants Agatha's eyes in so many ways. Rio wants the sharp piercing blue that reminds her of a cloudless winter morning, the deeper ocean hues that appear when she's sad, the steely grey when her sharp mind moves at light speed...</p><p>Agatha's eyes are so expressive Rio is sure the omega is unaware how much they give her away. It's also possible only Rio notices or she's looking way too hard, it wouldn't be the first time, but she can tell so much with a glance that being denied Agatha's gaze feels like she's been gagged.</p><p>"Would you mind making me a drink?" Ralph asks, turning to Agatha. "Agents? Would you like anything?"</p><p>Alice shakes her head but Rio jumps at the opportunity. </p><p>"Actually, if you don't mind, I need to use the restroom," Rio ducks her head and smiles sheepishly, Ralph waving her on, non-plussed by the request. </p><p>"Yeah, go ahead."</p><p>Rio nods her thanks and directs her next question to Agatha. </p><p>"Could you show me where it is?"</p><p>Agatha finally makes eye contact and her gaze is glassy and controlled, almost dull. Rio can't read anything from her flat stare and it makes her inner alpha anxious.</p><p>Agatha nods and Rio rises from her chair to follow the omega toward the downstairs bathroom. </p><p>Agatha leads her down a hallway that goes toward the garage where the small half-bath is located near the garage entrance. </p><p>When Agatha stops near the open door, Rio gently grasps Agatha's hand and tugs her into the bathroom, shutting the door behind them. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Rio whispers and the simple question is enough to bring Agatha to tears, covering her mouth to keep herself quiet. </p><p>Rio steps forward automatically, reaching out to comfort the omega but Agatha steps back sharply, fear making her eyes grow wide.</p><p>"No," Agatha croaks. "He'll smell you."</p><p>Rio's brow furrows in concern, it sounds like Agatha has laryngitis but she backs off and holds her hands up. </p><p>"Okay, okay, I'm sorry," she rushes out. </p><p>Rio puts her hands down. As much as she wants to rush Agatha out of the house or storm back into the living room and terrify the alpha, Rio knows she can't do anything without Agatha's approval first.</p><p>"Are you sick?" Rio asks and Agatha shakes her head. </p><p>Rio glances down at the turtleneck and back up at Agatha. </p><p>Slowly, so Agatha doesn't get scared, Rio reaches out with one hand, fingertips touching the top of Agatha's turtleneck and peeling it down just enough to see the edge of a bruise. </p><p>Rio pulls her hand back like she's been shocked and Agatha looks at her sadly, eyes pleading. </p><p>Rio's alpha snaps and snarls behind the mental barrier she keeps solidly in place but the beast is so feral she can feel the strain on her restraint while the predator calls for blood. </p><p>She doesn't realize her scent has changed until Agatha rushes to a small window and cracks it open, turning on the bathroom fan for good measure.</p><p>Rio makes a concentrated effort to bring herself back under control, closing her eyes and breathing in through her nose and out her mouth, using Agatha's scent to ground herself until she's able to speak.</p><p>"What do you need," Rio murmurs, opening her eyes once she's back in control. </p><p>"Can you arrest him?" Agatha rasps and Rio looks down, stomach dropping to her feet when she shakes her head. </p><p>"We're waiting for warrants," Rio explains, her mind quickly working toward another solution. </p><p>"Is there any way I can get you out of here?"</p><p>It's a plea as much as it is a question, her alpha howling at the thought of Agatha being near her husband any longer and impatiently urging Rio to do something as she mentally chastises her inner alpha for the more violent courses of action that flit across her mind's eye.</p><p>"I don't have anywhere to go," Agatha confesses, hugging herself around the middle in a way that has Rio yearning to touch. </p><p>"Stay with me," Rio impulsively replies. </p><p>Agatha doesn't hide her shock and neither does Rio but once she says it, she doesn't take it back. </p><p>"He doesn't know where I live and he thinks we just met for the first time. He'll never even think to guess you're with me."</p><p>Agatha bites her lip like she's considering it and sizes Rio up to see how serious she is and Rio hopes the omega can read the sincerity in her eyes. </p><p>Rio is acutely aware they are running low on time. She doesn't know what questions Alice is making up but she's going to owe her partner for the next six months. </p><p>"Give me your phone," Rio whispers. "I'll give you my number."</p><p>Agatha shakes her head again, "He has it."</p><p>Rio blows out a long breath to keep her cool and closes her eyes for a second, reminding herself that homicide is not a good look for a federal agent. </p><p>Rio reaches for her wallet and pulls out one of her business cards, holding it out for Agatha to take. </p><p>Agatha looks at it like a life preserver and reaches out to take the card, tucking it into a pocket. </p><p>Rio's eyes dart back and forth over Agatha's features, trying to memorize everything about her face and tucking her hands in her pockets to keep her from touching the other woman. </p><p>"Call any time," Rio murmurs. "I'll answer."</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together and her glassy eyes reflect the shine of the bathroom light. </p><p>The omega grows restless and slowly and silently turns the doorknob to open the door and retreat to the kitchen, giving Rio one final look of gratitude over her shoulder. </p><p>Rio needs a moment so she flushes the toilet and turns on the tap to wash her hands and keep up the facade. </p><p>By the time she rejoins Alice and Ralph, she can hear Agatha moving around in the kitchen. </p><p>Rio fits her mental mask over her face and smiles. </p><p>"Sorry about that, were you able to figure everything out?" Rio stares at Alice for a moment before turning a questioning gaze to Ralph. </p><p>"I think, so," Alice replies, thankfully catching the hint. </p><p>"Great! Now I can get out of here and start my weekend," she laughs as Agatha enters and hands a glass tumbler to her husband. </p><p>Agatha's scent fills her nose and she can't look at the omega, internal alarm telling her she needs to leave.</p><p>Alice stands and heads to the door and Ralph gets up to see them out. </p><p>"Thanks again," Rio presses her lips together in a tight smile and exits, unlocking the car and letting Alice say her goodbyes.</p><p>She drops into the passenger seat and Alice follows soon after, walking around to the driver's side and starting the car, pulling backward into the street.</p><p>Alice drives slow and Rio's leg jumps up and down, subconsciously pressing her right foot against the floor mat. </p><p>This is exactly why she had Alice drive. Rio is so full of fury and frustration she would be weaving recklessly through traffic, swearing and gripping the steering wheel while suddenly everyone else becomes an idiot on the road. </p><p>They slow when the traffic backs up, bumper to bumper cars trying to merge and inching forward every few seconds. </p><p>It feels like a fitting metaphor for Rio's situation, stuck moving inch by inch toward her destination when she wants to be moving at eighty miles an hour.</p><p>"She's not sick is she?" Alice breaks the silence.</p><p>"No," Rio growls.</p><p>Alice's grip on the steering wheel tightens. </p><p>"What's the plan?" Alice jumps ahead, easily predicting her partner's thoughts.</p><p>"Wait and receive," Rio grouses, biting on her thumbnail while her elbow perches on the window ledge. </p><p>Alice groans and Rio agrees with her.</p><p>Waiting is the hardest part of the job. </p><p>Travel times to crime scenes, waiting for judges to sign warrants, surveillance, red tape that only the correct paperwork can cut through...</p><p>All of it is time. And waiting is a choice. Doing nothing is a choice. </p><p>A choice she's forced to make.</p><p>Alice finally clears the traffic and they speed up, driving back toward their office. </p><p>Rio plugs her phone into the charger.</p><p>No messages. No missed calls. </p><p>She needs more time.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Evanora would be proud, Agatha thinks bitterly.</p><p>She cooks, she cleans, the laundry is done and her husband is happy.</p><p>Her soul shrivels a little more every day.</p><p>Ralph continues like nothing has changed. She cooks, they eat together, he makes her tea, and he actually sits with her while she watches her shows. </p><p>It feels like a perverse play at happiness, pretending at love while she dies inside.</p><p>Rio sits at the forefront of her thoughts, seeing her like a lighthouse in the night, if only she can get to shore. </p><p>It takes days for her bruises to fade but when they're light enough she carefully broaches the topic of work with Ralph. </p><p>"Would it be alright if I went back to work?" She asks over dinner one night. </p><p>Ralph grunts and swallows his food, "You should just quit."</p><p>Agatha tries not to wince, thinking quickly. </p><p>"It would be more work to quit. But I could if I finish out my cases," she offers, her voice going up hopefully. </p><p>Ralph seems to think about it, no doubt patting himself on the back for managing to get Agatha in line and still being 'benevolent'.</p><p>"How long would it take?"</p><p>Agatha stamps down the little bit of hope that flickers to life.</p><p>"Three months? Two and a half if I can pass off my cases to others."</p><p>It's a lie. She has no idea how long it would take but she doesn't need accuracy, she just needs an opportunity.</p><p>Ralph stabs another piece of steak and shrugs a shoulder. "Two months. They should be helping you more if you're pregnant."</p><p>Agatha's stomach turns and she takes a sip of water and nods, silently agreeing. </p><p>She lets out a shuddering breath, taking one last risk that she hopes won't backfire. </p><p>"I'll need my phone," she murmurs, and Ralph's eyes cut to hers, immediately suspicious.</p><p>Agatha doesn't look away, softening her expression into one of compliance. She forces herself to take a bite of her food, the meat flat and flavorless against her tongue.</p><p>Ralph reaches into his back pocket and slides her phone across the table and Agatha resists the urge to snatch it up, leaving it on the table as some kind of reassurance for him.</p><p>"Leave your location on," he orders quietly. "And answer back when I text you. I don't care if you're in a meeting."</p><p>Agatha nods, agreeing easily to his terms and quickly trying to mentally map out the next steps she needs to take. </p><p>"Thank you," she replies, standing up to refill her water and his. </p><p>"You're welcome," Ralph smirks, grabbing her forearm when she passes by and pulling her down for a kiss. "And thank <em>you</em> for asking."</p><p>Agatha is able to keep a straight face despite her disgust, but what surprises her is the internal defensive growl her inner omega lets out when he touches her. </p><p>The flicker of hope turns into a weak flame.</p><p>She can do this. </p><p>A few more days. </p><p>Agatha thinks about Rio's card safely hidden away in a shoebox with a pair of Louboutin heels, her shoes the only items of clothing he won't think to touch.</p><p>She has a lifeline. She just needs time. </p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha lulls him into comfort over the course of a week, following every rule and stipulation faithfully, even handing him her phone at the end of the day of her own volition, pleasantly surprising him and building his trust. </p><p>Every morning Ralph drives her to work, dropping her off in front of the building and picks her up in the evenings, waiting in one of the street parking stalls until she appears. </p><p>In her mid-size purse Agatha sneaks items from home to store at her office: birth certificate, passport, her glasses, jewelry with sentimental value, a small stash of clothes she can roll up and bring piece meal until she feels she has enough...</p><p>At work she uses an external hard drive to download her important data, avoiding their bank account lest he get a notification from an app.</p><p>The stress leaks into her work, simple mistakes appearing more frequently resulting in a check in with Lilia who looks at her with concern but dismisses her when Agatha says she's still recovering from being sick. </p><p>The edges of her resolve are starting to fray and she can feel the imaginary countdown on her window of opportunity getting critically low. </p><p>She's out of time. </p><p>There's more Agatha wishes she could take and even more she wishes she could do like wiping his hard drive or burning all his clothes á la Angela Bassett, but it's all fantasy. For now she needs to get away. </p><p>Ralph drops her off in the morning and she enters her building as usual, sequestering herself in her office, knowing she's going to get no work done but pretending to be productive. </p><p>Agatha had thought about telling Lilia but beyond the humiliation of revealing her failed mating, Agatha is too paranoid, predicting the first place Ralph would look for her is at work and not willing to put Lilia in a position to lie or worse...give her away.</p><p>She tries to spend the hours of her morning doing some work to make the time pass faster but more often than not Agatha finds herself staring at the blocked off time on her calendar for lunch that says "new client consult".</p><p>Her body shakes with anticipation when it gets close enough and she pulls Rio's folded card from her wallet, corners bent and softened from where it hides behind her license. </p><p>Agatha sits behind her desk and slowly picks up her office phone, dialing the mobile number and listening it to it ring once before someone picks up. </p><p>
<em>"Vidal."</em>
</p><p>"Hello," Agatha clings to her professional demeanor. "Could I speak with Amy Valdez please?"</p><p>Her hands sweat, leaving prints on her wooden desk. </p><p>There's a pause and some shuffling and the same voice, pitched lower and smoothed over, answers. </p><p>
<em>"This is Amy."</em>
</p><p>Agatha exhales in a rush, she's so close. </p><p>"This is Agatha Harkness, confirming our lunch meeting for today, twelve fifteen?"</p><p>Another shorter pause follows. </p><p>
<em>"Of course, sorry I forgot is it the Greek place or the cafe?" </em>
</p><p>It's a little daunting to hear how easily Rio lies but Agatha has only one chance; she'll deal with the consequences later. </p><p>"The cafe," Agatha answers.</p><p>
<em>"Sounds great, I'll see you soon."</em>
</p><p>Agatha hangs up and looks at her cell phone, picking it up and watching the screen wake. It takes her a second of looking at it, feeling like it's the last physical connection to her husband, almost glued to her hand like a digital handcuff. </p><p>She places it face up on her desk, her lock screen a photo of her and Ralph from their fifth anniversary, smile big as he mashes his lips to her cheek. </p><p>Agatha frowns and locks her phone, walking to the door and picking up her bag on the way out, saying a silent goodbye to everything she knows.</p><p>It's time.</p><p> </p>

<p>"Not super fancy, but I have a guest room. First door on the right."</p><p>Rio jiggles her keys out of the lock and tosses her bag on one of the mismatched living room chairs. There's a love seat that completes the area that's worn but looks soft. </p><p>Dark wood bookshelves hold pictures and scatterings of books and plants, and little knick knacks that are odd enough there must be stories behind them. The walls are almost black but when Agatha looks closer it's more of a very dark green. </p><p>An ivy vine curls down from a hanging window planter nearly meeting the vines of another plant with white spotted leaves that climbs the walls, clearly cared for if the strategically placed supports are any indication.</p><p>It feels cozy and lived in, comfortable.</p><p>Agatha is surprised but some how not. </p><p>She expected dark decor but she had thought the alpha would be more...sleek, sharp lines and metal, but the earthy tones and cluttered but organized space also makes sense, matching the alpha's scent that lingers over the room.</p><p>"Thanks," Agatha says quietly, locating the door and finding a much plainer but neat space. </p><p>The walls are still the same dark green but there is a cream colored rug and the dresser and bed frame are a lighter color wood, and a shelf with a single plant sits above the full size mattress.</p><p>Agatha puts her singular bag on the dresser, the room feeling too big for the miniscule amount of possessions she carries.</p><p>"Is there any one you want to call?"</p><p>Agatha turns and faces the alpha who stays just outside the doorway, like she's afraid to step into the space she technically owns.</p><p>Something in the alpha's eyes makes it difficult for Agatha to maintain eye contact for too long. It isn't quite pity but there's a sorrow there that makes Agatha feel fragile, like she's being handled delicately.</p><p>She wants the certainty from hours before that helped Agatha take the final step and leave the cafe at the agent's side.</p><p>
<em>"Hey," Rio's face lit up when Agatha took a seat in the booth.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"You're really here," Agatha breathed in amazement. She wasn't sure until she actually saw the other alpha that she would show up, still waiting for the hidden consequences for her actions.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio looked like she was out of breath, like she was the one running instead of Agatha. Her amber eyes were big and alert, and constantly scanned around them like she was waiting for a threat to appear and honestly, Agatha felt the same. She wanted to leave, get out from the public eye where anyone else could spot her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"What do you need?" </em>
</p><p>
<em>"To disappear."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Okay. Ready?" Rio nodded, already moving out of the booth, keys in hand and Agatha surged with adrenaline, following the agent out to her parked car.</em>
</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio's voice breaks through Agatha's thoughts and the omega snaps her eyes to Rio.</p><p>"What did you say?" Agatha's eyes refocus and Rio looks at her in concern. </p><p>"Is there anyone you want to call?"</p><p>Agatha thinks of Jen for a second, wanting the comfort of a familiar presence but the shame is still too raw and overwhelming. She wouldn't be able to handle the avalanche of 'I told you so's' that would no doubt bury Agatha alive. </p><p>She shakes her head instead, standing awkwardly in an unfamiliar room, in an unfamiliar apartment, with none of her things. </p><p>She feels out of place, more than she does in her regular life and part of her begins to wonder if this was a good idea. </p><p>Rio seems to share her awkwardness, kicking her toe lightly against the doorframe and filling the silence with nervous rambling.</p><p>"You're welcome to anything in the fridge and cabinets, I put a set of towels in the bathroom," Rio tries to think over anything the omega might need to know but with Agatha right in front of her everything she lists in her brain suddenly dissipates. </p><p>She'll probably frustratingly remember all of it the moment she walks away,"Uh, if you need anything specific, let me know, and I'll get it."</p><p>Agatha nods shortly and Rio gets the feeling she should leave and bites back the urge to ask Agatha if she needs anything, her urge to help working on overdrive though she knows from experience it can come off as smothering.</p><p>"I'll let you get settled," Rio gives Agatha a tight smile and reaches to close the door.</p><p>"Rio?" </p><p>The alpha stops, ready and waiting for a request.</p><p>"Thank you," Agatha, murmurs.</p><p>Rio nods and her smile softens a little, closing the door and leaving Agatha alone.</p><p>Agatha unpacks her things quickly, opening the top drawer to find a few shirts and pants already there. The top shirt says 'Quantico' across the chest, the screenprint cracked from multiple washes.</p><p>Agatha runs her hand over the top and lifts the shirt to her nose. It's laundry detergent more than anything but it still comforts Agatha, the difference negligible when everything else around her is new. </p><p>It hits Agatha after a moment. </p><p>She has nothing. </p><p>There is maybe a week of underwear and clothes she packed and her important documents but for everything else, she realizes she's completely dependent on Rio. </p><p>Even for something as simple as toothpaste, Agatha can't have it if Rio doesn't provide it. </p><p>Is it really better to be dependent on one alpha over another?</p><p>How pathetic as well to need an alpha's help to get away from another alpha, like she's something to be traded back and forth, like currency.</p><p>With Ralph she had her house, her clothes, her job and a car. She had access to her money, to Jen, she could leave the house...</p><p>Yes she had rules but she had adapted quickly.</p><p>Now that Agatha is leaving Ralph she has to ask for <em>everything</em>, and there are different rules to abide by that have her looking over her shoulder in fear.</p><p>It's a different kind of helplessness that magnifies when Agatha's inner omega starts to come to terms with being away from her mate.</p><p>The omega feels the tug, begging her to go home, to reconcile, wanting the physical closeness, happily curling up under sheets and blankets, nestling peacefully in a cocoon of scents and limbs.</p><p>The inner omega ignores everything else, fading the terrible memories and bringing the good to the forefront, a dangerous nostalgic amnesia tinting her recall.</p><p>Agatha puts the shirt back and makes some space for her things. It feels odd, like Agatha is claiming a drawer at a lover's place to mark territory and her inner omega snarls at that, not happy with the concept of betraying her mate.</p><p>Her fingers brush over her mated mark, the skin tingling under her touch and igniting another wave of longing for her mate. </p><p>Agatha pulls her fingers away quickly and hisses. Ralph 'refreshing' the bite mark strengthens their bond, making her more susceptible to his influence, another way to manipulate Agatha into submission.</p><p>She wants to claw the mark from her skin. </p><p>Agatha sits on the bed, drawing her knees up and wrapping her arms around them. She doesn't know what to do. It already feels like Agatha is intruding and she doesn't particularly want company at the moment, and she doesn't feel right about changing her clothes so early in the day so she simply... sits.</p><p>And thinks.</p><p>And regrets.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio finishes cooking, plating the arroz con pollo on two plates. She worries a little about food allergies but figures she can make something else for Agatha and take the leftovers for lunch if she needs to.</p><p>Agatha probably would have told Rio if she has any allergies but Rio has no idea what is running through the omega's mind.</p><p>Rio has had people in her space before but it's always an adjustment, weirdly having to get through playing a good host before she settles down and gets used to the other person's presence.</p><p>She hates that she feels so awkward, wishing she could be one of those people who immediately puts others at ease but Rio has never been that kind of person; more likely to offer a pat on the shoulder than a hug.</p><p>Rio will never admit it to anyone but she thinks the best way might be to treat Agatha like a feral cat; time, food, space, and quiet, gentle interactions.</p><p>Walking down the short hallway, Rio knocks on Agatha's door, "Hey, Agatha? I made some dinner if you want?"</p><p>Holding her ear close to the door, Rio listens for any movement or acknowledgement. If she couldn't faintly smell the omega, Rio would assume Agatha wasn't in there. </p><p>Patience, Rio reminds herself. </p><p>"Whenever you want it, I'll leave it in the microwave for you."</p><p>Rio wonders whether Agatha is sleeping and though she wants to check, Rio resists, wanting to respect what little space Agatha has.</p><p>The alpha turns and heads back to her kitchen but before she crosses the threshold Rio hears the door open and stops in time to see Agatha peeking out after her. Smiling to herself, Rio continues, trusting that Agatha will follow. </p><p>Rio doesn't look but Agatha's scent grows stronger when she enters the same space and Rio continues like Agatha isnt there, getting the feeling if she makes a big deal about anything Agatha does, the woman will retreat.</p><p>So Rio remains silent while she moves around her small kitchen and turns on her bluetooth speaker, picking a playlist from her phone to play quietly in the background and fill in the silence.</p><p>While she stares at her phone, Rio is struck by how similar this is to a date. The fantasy is tempting but Rio is more concerned that Agatha will get the wrong idea so she keeps a respectful distance.</p><p>Rio puts both plates on her four seat dining room table, placing Agatha's plate to her right and taking her seat, not waiting for Agatha to sit to start eating but celebrating internally when the omega eventually pulls out the chair and sits down. </p><p>Agatha picks up her fork with controlled motions. Where Rio inhales her food, Agatha takes measured bites; not commenting on the food but taking larger and more frequent bites which Rio takes as a good sign.</p><p>Minutes pass with just the lo-fi music Rio finds calming floating through the room, until Agatha's voice carries just above the melody.</p><p>"What..." Agatha clears her throat. "What was it like when your mother first left your father?"</p><p>Rio pauses to think; not because she doesn't remember but because she doesn't know how much to tell Agatha. She wants to give her the truth but it's a delicate balance between harsh reality and encouraging someone's resolve.</p><p>"Hard," Rio confesses.</p><p>"My abuelita and my tias took care of me for the first few weeks. My mom couldn't do much because she was sick and dealing with...everything."</p><p>There isn't a succint way to encompass the heartbreak.</p><p>"Few times I walked in on my mom crying in the kitchen with one of my tias."</p><p>It was at a table just like the one she and Agatha sit at now. If it was bad her Tia would rush her out of the room, if her mom managed to pull herself together she would smile at Rio with watery, red-rimmed eyes. </p><p>The juxtaposition did more to unsettle her than it did to comfort so Rio tries to be honest to keep from inflicting the same unease on Agatha.</p><p>"I've worked a few similar cases..." Rio starts slowly, while she gauges Agatha's tolerance, not wanting to offend the omega. </p><p>"The first month is difficult. A lot of omegas go back either because of biology or because they feel like they don't have a choice..."</p><p>Agatha's eyes dart down to the table and back up again, fighting against something internally that shows up as distress on her face. </p><p>Rio grips her fork tighter and forces her eyes back down to her plate.</p><p>"Would you stop me if I wanted to go back?"</p><p>The question hits Rio in the chest like a freight train, sending both her and her alpha spiraling.</p><p>Of course her knee jerk reaction is a firm yes. </p><p>Rio's alpha wants to lock the doors and keep Agatha with her where she's safe, where Rio can watch her. </p><p>But after the initial surge of possessiveness, Rio calms her inner alpha. Keeping Agatha in a cage, even for her own safety, is still a cage and ultimately it would be for Rio's satisfaction. </p><p>Rio swallows her food painfully, her throat suddenly dry, and reaches for her glass of water for both a moment to think and so she doesn't choke. </p><p>"No," Rio says sadly, clearing her throat. "I would probably try to convince you not to, but ultimately I can't make that choice for you."</p><p>Agatha stares at her and Rio takes the opportunity to stare back, taking in Agatha's wet eyes and slumped, defeated posture while she pushes the chicken around on her plate.</p><p>"I don't want to go back," Agatha murmurs and breaks her gaze to look down.</p><p>Rio should be relieved, and a large part of her is, but she latches on to the way Agatha says it so sadly, like it's the lesser of two evils. It doesn't necessarily reassure Rio.</p><p>Agatha fidgets, her forefinger picking at her thumb and biting her lower lip in a way that Rio knows is born from anxiety but can't help but find really fucking attractive as her eyes are drawn to the movement.</p><p>"I...I don't have access to my money, I can't pay you anything," Agatha mutters, her foot shaking under the table hard enough that Rio can see her body moving slightly.</p><p>The alpha begins to piece together the context clues.</p><p>"I don't want you to," Rio replies easily and Agatha is back to looking at her skeptically. </p><p>"What do you want?" Agatha's voice comes off stern and guarded. She's done playing nice and trying to figure out ulterior motives, she just wants the truth. </p><p>The problem is that Rio has no ulterior motive. Sure she has <em>hopes</em> but Rio isn't about to use Agatha's tragedy as a means to get her in to bed.</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>"Nothing?" Agatha's eyes narrow, disbelieving.</p><p>"Does that surprise you?" Rio goes back to eating. She has about three meals she can cook reliably then after that she's out of her depth, resorting to easy to make basics like spaghetti. Hopefully Agatha doesn't judge her too harshly</p><p>"Yes," Agatha stabs an olive and continues, rambling all at once like she's ripping off a bandaid.</p><p>"When I get access to my account, I'll look for a new place. It might be two weeks minimum -"</p><p>"Agatha..." Rio tries to get the omega's attention but Agatha is on a roll and doesn't notice.</p><p>"Maybe three, but I can call around if I can borrow your phone..."</p><p>"Agatha," Rio reaches across the table and rests her hand on Agatha's. They both stop, Agatha looking down at Rio's hand and Rio staring at the top of her head, waiting for Agatha to look up.</p><p>"You don't have to pay me anything. Yes you can borrow my phone, I'll work on getting you a replacement."</p><p>Agatha's skin is clammy, much different than the warmth Rio remembers which Rio attributes to stress, without thinking she rubs her thumb over the back of Agatha's hand. </p><p>Agatha doesn't pull away, she just lets it happen. Her fingers twitch like she wants to move but remains still aside from a deep silent inhale.</p><p>"You can stay as long as you need, you don't have to rush," Rio lowers her voice to emphasize how much she means what she says. </p><p>If Agatha wants to stay, Rio can't imagine saying no. </p><p>Agatha stares at her hand like it's a foreign object, turning her wrist slowly until her palm faces upward. Rio lifts her fingers until Agatha settles again, hand open expectantly. </p><p>Rio slides her palm against Agatha's, not really holding, just resting and offering comfort in simple human contact without expectation. Her inner alpha is content, happy to be able to provide some solace and buzzing with accomplishment when Agatha seems to release some of her tension.</p><p>"I'm scared," Agatha whispers.</p><p>It's a reluctant confession. Betraying a weakness goes against Agatha's self-preservation instinct but her need for reassurance is stronger.</p><p>"You're allowed to be," Rio watches Agatha take a breath. Telling the omega not to be scared feels patronizing, especially being an alpha, so Rio again tells the truth.</p><p>"You're safe here, Agatha."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Five days later and there is a tentative routine both women have managed to work out, learning to adapt small habits and idosyncracies in order to coexist.</p><p>Rio leaves for work fairly early and will make a pot of coffee, taking her cup to go and leaving the rest of the pot for Agatha, placing an empty mug next to the machine and checking to make sure there is almond milk for her.</p><p>Around the third day, Agatha starts making dinner, Rio happily scarfing down the tofu stir fry when she comes home to delicious smells coming from the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha gives Rio a reproachful look, clearly judging the alpha's lack of manners but Rio is unphased, shielded by a full belly and post-meal sleepiness. </p><p>Starting then, Rio comes home to Agatha making dinner every night. </p><p>Agatha is careful not to move anything or disturb Rio's things but Rio does notice that her shelves seem like they're dusted and her plants are watered, finding the soil wet when she touches it. </p><p>One night, Rio is exhausted from work but still needs to do her laundry, having put off the chore for a little too long. </p><p>She ends up falling asleep on her couch waiting for her washer to finish and when she wakes in the middle of the night and remembers, Rio groans, knowing she'll have to do another wash cycle.</p><p>But instead of finding a damp load of laundry, her washed and dried clothes are folded and sitting in her laundry basket on top of the drier.</p><p>Rio's face heats up and she represses the giddy grin that threatens to split her cheeks.</p><p>William from cybercrimes finds a phone, about a generation old, that he wipes and gives to Rio who gifts it to Agatha for her to use and it goes a long way toward improving Agatha's mood, easing her isolation and giving her a line to the outside world. </p><p>It's how Agatha learns that the media has caught wind that VersaRX is now under active FBI investigation. Signed warrants allow the bureau to dig further into the company's finances and research while Ralph as the CEO makes a statement about cooperation and denying any unlawful activity.</p><p>That night they talk over homemade lasagna.</p><p>"How bad is it?" Agatha asks. She appreciates that Rio doesn't pretend she doesn't know what Agatha is talking about, it would be very difficult to miss one of the leading news headlines and Rio is connected to the case, possibly knowing about the news story before it aired.</p><p>"I can't say too much," Rio replies and Agatha frowns. She's heard some version of this from Ralph and though she logically knows Rio cant divulge details, it still annoys her. </p><p>"But it's pretty bad," Rio offers, trying to figure out if Agatha is upset with her or the circumstances.</p><p>"You mentioned warrants," Agatha's sharp mind recalls and Rio nods.</p><p>"Arrest warrants. Waiting for a judge," It's Rio's turn to frown. They had submitted all their evidence and reports but they were in a queue, higher priority and time sensitive cases taking precedence, nevermind the time it will take for a judge to review everything...</p><p>Agatha seems to understand her frustration, mirroring Rio's displeasure on her own face and grumbling under her breath, "Morons."</p><p>Rio nods in silent agreement, watching Agatha stand to refill her water and press start on the dishwasher when she passes it by.</p><p>"You know you don't have to cook or do...all of that right?" Rio speaks before she can process the words through her filter and she internally winces when she realizes how harsh it probably sounded to the omega.</p><p>Surprisingly, Agatha doesn't seem to be offended or even phased by the question and Rio exhales in relief.</p><p>"I like cooking, and it's not like I have much else to do," Agatha points out, sarcasm tinting her reply in a way that gives Rio hope that Agatha's spirit hasn't been completely crushed.</p><p>"No hobbies?" </p><p>"Not unless you count trashy television," Agatha mutters then catches herself, pressing her lips together.</p><p>"What's your version of trash?" Rio's question is genuine but when Agatha blushes and hides behind a bite of food, Rio's answering grin is playful, "Oh now you have to tell me."</p><p>Agatha wipes her mouth with her napkin and licks her lips, the blush fades in intensity but still colors her cheeks.</p><p>"Reality dating shows."</p><p>Rio tilts her head, adding yet another facet to the omega in front of her, "I...did not expect that?"</p><p>"What did you expect?"</p><p>"True crime, maybe," Rio shrugs.</p><p>"Have enough of that, thank you," Agatha waves away the idea with her fork and turns the question back on Rio.</p><p>"What about you? I noticed your little garden...everywhere," she gestures around her vaguely and Rio smiles.</p><p>"Picked it up from my abuelita. She had a green thumb."</p><p>Heaven forbid you ever mention you were bored around Isabella Marie Valdez. Rio used to hate it because she ended up doing reluctant chores around the house, grumbling the entire time, until her abuelita made her help repot some of her plants that outgrew their containers. </p><p>Something about the dirt and simple but manual labor ceased Rio's complaining and from then on, she would direct Rio to her plants, teaching her names and how to care for each plant, talking to them like they were old family friends. </p><p>"You talk a lot about her," Agatha points out; making a call back to an earlier conversation though Rio is aware of how much she talks about her grandma, not ashamed of how much she loves the woman.</p><p>"She helped raise me. When my mom couldn't be there she was." </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow,"What about your aunts and cousins?"</p><p>Rio shrugs and leans forward, resting both elbows on the table. </p><p>"They were there too but between my two tias they have five kids so they were pretty busy. My abuelita is the one who would take me aside and do little things for me like take me shopping with her, or help me with school...she even took me to get my ears pierced in middle school."</p><p>Rio recalls the memories fondly though with hindsight she thinks her abuela felt bad for her and gave her extra attention to make up for her troubled family. </p><p>Agatha seems to reflect on the information and her gaze falls to the middle distance, firmly in the hold of either a memory or a day dream. She looks sad, regret tinging the tight smile as she rubs her lips together. </p><p>"I'm glad we did have any," Agatha admits. </p><p>"Before I left he took my suppressants..."</p><p>Agatha stops mid-sentence and gasps, mouth falling open and eyes wide.</p><p>Rio is immediately on guard, looking behind her and then back at Agatha, "What? What's wrong?"</p><p>"What's today's date?" Agatha looks like she might be panicking and her distress sets off Rio's alpha, suddenly very alert and attentive for potential threat.</p><p>"Uh...the twenty first," Rio confirms, checking her phone.</p><p>"Shit," Agatha whispers, placing her hands on the table like she's trying to stabilize herself. </p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio is growing more anxious the longer Agatha takes to explain but finally Agatha spits it out. </p><p>"Ralph stole my suppressants and my birth control, I can't get them back."</p><p>Christ. The more Rio learns about this man the more she wants to give over to her baser instincts and challenge him like they used to do in history books, fighting with teeth and claws until someone submits or dies. </p><p>It would be much more satisfying than the more modern "challenging" that includes hours of litigation. </p><p>"Did you call your doctor?" Rio blurts out and the look Agatha gives her could peel wallpaper and has Rio back pedaling immediately. </p><p>"Sorry, sorry not doubting you just...working through what to do," Rio explains and Agatha's glare loses it's edge. </p><p>"Okay so you called your doctor and?"</p><p>"I'm mated," Agatha growls and Rio doesnt understand at first, squinting to try and figure it out. "I can't get them without both of us signing off."</p><p>Rio recoils in surprise, her face scrunching in disgust. She had no idea that was a requirement and it annoys her that she's only learning about it now. </p><p>Rio makes a mental note to ask her mother at a later date how she was able to obtain birth control while married to her father.</p><p>Right now, her brain starts to focus on solutions to the potential problem. </p><p>"Okay..." Rio exhales. "Okay so what do you need? I can get a pregnancy test or...or the morning after pill?"</p><p>"No...I mean yes, maybe a pregnancy test," Agatha considers.</p><p>"Do you think you might be?" Rio feels bad that she hopes the answer is no but she can't imagine the complications a pregnancy would bring to Agatha's situation.</p><p>"I don't know...it would be too soon to tell," Agatha looks pained and wraps her arms around her middle and Rio wonders if she's subconsciously protecting the potential life inside or shielding herself from the guilt that pulls at the corners of her mouth and makes her eyebrows lift in uncertainty. </p><p>Rio goes through a rollercoaster of emotions in about five seconds. Her knee jerk response is revulsion born from biological response, not wanting to raise another alpha's child. Revulsion quickly turns to shame at inserting herself into Agatha's potential future and finally, shame turns to longing when the idea of a child with Agatha presents itself in her mind and her alpha goes right back to pining.</p><p>Rio chides herself and refocuses. </p><p>"Okay, as soon as we're done eating I can go to the supermarket and grab one. Do you need anything else? While I'm there I can grab groceries or-"</p><p>"No, wait," Agatha interrupts firmly and Rio stops, freezing in place, attention back on Agatha. </p><p>"I'm due for a heat cycle," Agatha grumbles with embarrassment. "Sometime this week or early next week."</p><p>There's a delay as Rio processes what Agatha tells her.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Agatha shifts uncomfortably in her seat, blushing and clearing her throat awkwardly.</p><p>"I can stay somewhere else," she offers. Agatha doesn't know where she would go but she could figure it out of she really needed to. If worse comes to worse she can rent a motel room for a week and pay Rio back later. </p><p>"No...no it'll be fine," Rio's brain catches up and her face feels hot. Agatha going through a heat shouldn't be a problem, other omegas went through it all the time. "What did you do before you took suppressants."</p><p>"I've never been off them. I started as soon as I presented," Agatha sounds nervous and Rio can feel her hands getting sweaty. </p><p>Her imagination is not her friend in that moment.</p><p>Agatha warm and yielding, body stretching and rolling with desperation, sounds of pleasure leaving her lips in sighs and moans, sweat making her skin dewy and slippery, head falling back and eyes closing...</p><p>"Okay...okay..." Rio tries to breathe normally and bring her body back under control before she ends up with an embarrassing tent in her pants. </p><p>Agatha eyes widen a fraction and she blushes harder and her eyes drop down to her half eaten dinner and Rio prays her scent didn't give her away.</p><p>She pulls her phone from her back pocket and starts to type keywords into the search engine, typing, scrolling, and reading, her own plate ignored in favor of distraction and research.</p><p>Not happy with seemingly being ignored, Agatha furrows her brow and asks, "What are you doing?"</p><p>"Looking up how to help an omega through heat?" Rio looks up, hoping Agatha isn't offended. </p><p>When she doesn't get a glare or indignant outrage from the omega, Rio's eyes go back to her phone, scanning short articles and opening a few tabs from reddit to read later for suggestions, scrolling through lifestyle articles from crunchier parts of the 'all natural' suppressant free movement for any bit of information that might be useful.</p><p>"What does the internet say?" Agatha asks after a few moments. </p><p>"Uh..." Rio goes back to the tab with the most promising information. "Okay, here we go, there's um...suggestions."</p><p>Agatha waits expectantly. </p><p>"There's some patches and creams..." Rio starts. </p><p>"Separate rooms, lots of water and healthy snacks, change the sheets often to reduce lingering pheromones..." </p><p>There's a lot of information and her brain absorbs it all, latching on to the crumb of interest that expands into a rabbit hole she's resists diving into head first if only so Agatha doesn't think Rio is ignoring her. She'll read them later when she gets ready for bed.</p><p>Rio looks up and puts her phone back in her pocket, "Is it okay that I keep researching this or...?"</p><p>By that time, Agatha is already up and collecting their dishes to rinse and ready for the dishwasher.</p><p>"You've never been around an omega in heat?" Agatha asks with some surprise, turning on the tap while Rio searches for a tupperware for the leftovers.</p><p>"I...have," Rio finds a matching lid for the container she holds and works on transferring the lasagna from the ceramic dish to the container. </p><p>"What did you do then?" Agatha asks</p><p>"We fu- uh," Rio is concentrating so hard on not letting her hand touch Agatha's when she hands over the dish to be washed that she momentarily forgets her inner filter. </p><p>"I was in a relationship...with them."</p><p>Agatha's wet hand holds the dish and Rio realizes she's waiting for her to let go, pulling her hand back after a few seconds too long.</p><p>Agatha's blush extends down her neck and Rio can feel her own skin heating up as well as they both decide to ignore the slip.</p><p>"I'll let you know if I need anything," the omega replies when she's finished loading the dishwasher. </p><p>"Sounds good," Rio nods and makes a quick escape from the kitchen to head to her bedroom to continue her research and escape the burning embarrassment of her own awkwardness. </p><p>And take a shower. </p><p>A cold one. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Agatha wakes it's before dawn.</p><p>There isn't a set time she wakes up necessarily, her internal clock is fairly consistent, usually waking her by seven thirty, but as soon as she shakes the lingering sleep from her frontal lobe, she realizes just how warm she is.</p><p>In fact, she's warm enough that her covers have been kicked to the bottom of her bed and she's covered in a thin sheen of sweat that makes her clammy in the early morning air. </p><p>Her body aches and she turns over onto her back, rubbing her legs together and whimpering at the slight stimulation and realizing the inside of her thighs are slick. </p><p>Agatha pouts to herself, her heat must have started sometime in the night. </p><p>At least she knows she's not pregnant.</p><p>She reaches for her phone to text Rio and warn her but the alpha is already ahead of her when she checks her messages.</p><p>
<em>"Hey, I took the week off but I have to go in just for the morning to settle some stuff then I'll be back."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"There's breakfast in the kitchen, too."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I don't know if you saw it but I put the patches and cream in the bathroom for you if you want to use them."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"What kind of dessert do you like?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I'll be back around 1:30p in case you were worried about me being around."</em>
</p><p>Agatha reads each one and though her body distractingly feels like she's hot and cold at the same time, she can still read the care and worry through Rio's words, typing a response to her question while the sentiment stirs affection that only feeds into the simmering arousal in her lower belly.</p><p>She groans and forces herself out of bed, wanting to take advantage of the empty house to eat and shower without inconveniencing the alpha. </p><p>Agatha undresses in the bathroom and steps under the water once it heats up, immediately choking on a moan when she realizes her entire body feels like a raw nerve, every sensation on her skin magnified and directed straight to her groin. </p><p>She's stuck panting beneath the water, aching with thoughts racing of past relations with her husband, her scent memory recalling his smell and the way he feels inside her when he tries to go as deep as possible...</p><p>Agatha's hand moves on instinct, dipping between her legs and stroking two fingers over her clit in a familiar pattern, lighting a match that ignites her arousal like gasoline, burning through every surface of her skin until it's almost painful. </p><p>The first orgasm hits her quickly, nearly doubling over as Agatha leans against the tiled wall. A second climax follows directly on the heels of the first, drawing a wet moan from her throat and making her grateful Rio isn't home. </p><p>Agatha can't believe how intense everything feels. She's so used to being on her suppressants that her heat cycles are maybe an eighth of what she feels now, though she isn't sure if her heat is intensified by the absence of her mate. </p><p>Feeling tension begin to coil anew, Agatha rushes through washing her hair and body, wincing when the fluffy, soft towel brushes against her reddened nipples. If this is a preview to pregnancy then Agatha is definitely only having one. </p><p>Once the thought of pregnancy enters Agatha's mind, her omega howls with grief desperately wanting her belly to swell with life, seeking to fulfill the fantasy of a family and offspring. </p><p>The mark on her neck itches and burns, and when Agatha looks in the mirror above the sink she notices her mark presenting more like a rash now; angry, red, and puffy where Ralph's teeth marks her skin.</p><p>She grabs for the cream first, reading the directions on the back before ripping open the seal and tilting her head to carefully apply the clear cool gel that offers her mild relief as she blows a breath out through her mouth. </p><p>The patches are next, designed more like a square bandage that sticks over her mating mark that's supposed to help neutralize some of the pheromones running rampant in her body. </p><p>With two orgasms and some medical science, Agatha feels the edge of her arousal lessen enough that she can focus on other things like getting dressed and eating. </p><p>A bra sounds like torture so she opts for the Quantico shirt that sits at the top of the drawer. It's soft enough that it's comfortable and doesn't overstimulate her too much. </p><p>Once she's fully dressed, Agatha takes her phone and heads downstairs to search for the promised breakfast that she finds in the microwave, reheating the breakfast burritos until they're warm.</p><p>After the first bite of tortilla stuffed with egg, bacon, chorizo and potato, Agatha realizes she's famished and eats both burritos in quick succession. </p><p>She does feel a little better and more level headed, assuming the patch is doing it's job on top of a full stomach. She checks her phone again, seeing no further messages and decides to peruse the news, bringing up the latest on the investigation into VersaRX. </p><p>Clicking on an article, Agatha is confronted by her husband's professional photo and a sharp ache pierces her gut, full of longing and desire that sparks another wave of arousal. </p><p>She needs him. She needs her mate. </p><p>Agatha grits her teeth together, hissing when more sensation prickles over her skin, like the air in the room is caressing her and driving her toward lust fueled madness.</p><p>Though her omega longs for its mate, the scent surrounding her does not match, creating an odd amalgamation of feelings that confuse her omega, finding herself longing for Ralph but not his smell, replacing the scent with the woodsy one that lingers around her now.</p><p>Agatha puts her phone away when her mind starts drifting to thoughts of calling her husband, just for a quick hookup that she knows will not be quick, nor satisfying, rationalizing with her primitive brain that not only is he dangerous, she will get pregnant and then truly be screwed, forever attached to the biggest mistake of her life. </p><p>Her omega reasons that if she doesn't have her mate, she could consider the next best option...</p><p>Snarling at the thought, Agatha returns upstairs to change her sheets and lock herself in her room to keep from doing something stupid.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio has the good sense to carry a mask when she enters her house.</p><p>Her pupils dilate and her blood starts to rush as her heart pumps faster and Rio pulls out her mask and fits it over her face, pinching down the bridge on her nose to seal it properly. </p><p>Jesus fucking christ, she isn't going to survive the week. </p><p>If Rio thought the food Agatha cooked made her house smell good, it was nothing compared to the omega in heat. Rio's head turns instinctively toward the bedrooms and her feet draw her halfway to Agatha's door before Rio catches herself and turns around.</p><p>She left the groceries in the doorway.</p><p>Rio picks up the bag and takes it to the kitchen to unpack, restocking vegetables and meat for the week plus the tiramisu she got for Agatha.</p><p>She hears the door open and thankfully Agatha's scent doesn't seem to get stronger, her mask filtering the pheromones as it should. Agatha enters and takes a look at Rio, grimacing at the sight of the mask. </p><p>"You doing alright?" Rio asks, voice muffled. </p><p>Agatha scrunches her face, her nose wrinkling as she shrugs. </p><p>"The patches help," she answers, not really wanting to discuss how incredibly turned on she got before using them or how tempted she was to run back to her mate for a short time.</p><p>"Good," Rio nods. "I'll pick up more later."</p><p>Agatha fidgets and shifts her weight from foot to foot and that's when Rio notices that Agatha is wearing Rio's shirt and her pulse picks up despite the mask covering her nose. </p><p>The alpha in Rio puffs its chest in pride and satisfaction, greedily taking in the sight of the way Agatha fills out her old shirt, pulling slightly where her nipples poke against the fabric. </p><p>Rio decides she's going to need to come to terms with being half hard for the rest of the week.</p><p>"Could you make that chicken and rice thing again?" Agatha bites at her thumbnail and Rio is glad her dumb smile is obscured from view. </p><p>"Sure," Rio agrees. "You wanna go watch something? I'll let you know when it's done."</p><p>Agatha shuffles out to the living room and Rio hears the television turn on as she gets to work.</p><p>With Agatha a room away it's easier for Rio to focus, trying to reframe the situation as if Alice were sick and she is taking care of her. Maybe if she pretends Agatha is Alice it would be easier. </p><p>She definitely doesn't want to sleep with Alice. </p><p>When everything is in the pot and cooking, Rio goes to her bathroom, searching out the Vicks vapor rub and over the nose strips she bought a few days ago specifically for this reason. </p><p>The harsh ointment she rubs under her nose kills some of her sense of smell and the clip over the bridge of her nose helps deaden Agatha's pheromones. </p><p>By the time she's done changing out of her work clothes and prepping in the bathroom, the food is ready.</p><p>Rio spoons rice into two bowls with a portion of chicken and takes a bowl with a glass of water to Agatha on the couch before retrieving her own bowl and glass to join Agatha.</p><p>A reality dating show is on screen and Rio smirks, remembering Agatha's confession from days ago. </p><p>Agatha's scent is still there, but with the precautions both of them take, it's a bearable sort of torture. It gives Rio hope that maybe she is overreacting about how difficult it would be to deal with an omega in heat. </p><p>Without sleeping with them.</p><p>They can do this.</p><p>-------------</p><p>It's on the third day Agatha's heat hits its peak.</p><p>The strain on Agatha's body from constant tension makes her tired and irritable and for the most part she tries to sequester herself in her room, taking frequent naps and masturbating furiously to abate her lust, emerging only to use the bathroom and for food.</p><p>Agatha changes the sheets on her bed at least once a day which does help keep the pheromones to a manageable level, and Rio throws them in the wash for her to reuse in a rotation. For the most part, Rio makes sure they're stocked with medicine and takes care of cooking for the week, letting Agatha rest.</p><p>That night, Rio is struck with insomnia, scrolling through her computer to do more research on omega health while a movie plays in the background, bathing the room in a slightly blue LED glow that creates harsh shadows throughout the room.</p><p>It's a little after midnight when Rio hears shuffling and pauses to listen. With her sense of smell stunted, she relies more on her hearing to track her environment. </p><p>"Rio?" Agatha stands just at the entrance to the living room and Rio sits up to put her laptop on the coffee table.</p><p>"Hm?" She waves Agatha over who looks a little wobbly, like a newborn fawn, but she makes it to the couch, dropping heavily onto the cushions. Agatha is dressed in her sleep clothes, a pair of shorts borrowed from Rio and a worn shirt of her own slipping off her shoulder to expose the mating mark that looks ten times worse than when Rio last saw it. </p><p>The skin is red, puffy and shiny, clearly swollen and uncomfortable. The red spreads like a rash on the outer perimeter of the bite, like she's been bitten by large snake which...she kind of was, Rio thinks bitterly. </p><p>It looks painful and Rio winces in sympathy.</p><p>"You okay?" Rio asks with concern.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, unruly hair falling over her face.</p><p>"No."</p><p>The omega's voice sounds strained and she's panting lightly, her skin clammy and paler than usual under the artifical light. Agatha's head lolls forward, hanging heavily on her neck until Rio reaches forward instinctively and clasps her hands around Agatha's face to tilt her head up.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>The moment Rio catches Agatha's eyes warning bells sound in her head. There is no blue left in Agatha's eyes, her pupils overtaking the irises until her eyes are dark pools of pure desire concentrated directly on Rio. </p><p>Agatha wraps her fingers around Rio's wrist and her lips part at the simple touch. Agatha's fingers travel up Rio's arm, drawing goosebumps across her skin until Agatha's fingers brush against the nape of her neck.</p><p>"I need..."</p><p>Rio's eyes widen but she can't move, entirely captivated by how bold Agatha's touch is and how much she likes it, her alpha easily leaning toward the affection. A bit of Agatha's scent is able to seep through and Rio's nostrils flare.</p><p>She can smell Agatha's heady musk but under it sits the cigarette butt smell that she recognizes as Ralph's which does more to help her resistance than anything else.</p><p>"Agatha..." Rio warns as much for herself as for the omega.</p><p>Agatha isn't deterred. She moves closer into Rio's space, the top half of her body nearly draping over Rio's lap in the process. </p><p>"Please?" Agatha's plea is high and needy and the rush of blood from Rio's head to her groin makes her dizzy and holy shit she's never felt a pull so intense that with just one word Rio's will nearly breaks.</p><p>Agatha sits up on her hands and knees and crawls over Rio who leans back against the armrest of the couch, hands lifting to Agatha's hips to stop her from sitting in her lap. </p><p>"Agatha, this isn't what you want," Rio's voice is breathier than she would like and she can't help but notice how soft the omega is where her fingers slip between her shorts and shirt.</p><p>Agatha whines and arcs her body into the touch, leaning down to nose against Rio's ear. The alpha shudders and gasps quietly, resolve crumbling brick by brick until Agatha speaks.</p><p>"I want him." Rio freezes, her growl rumbling low in her chest. Agatha either doesn't notice or doesn't care because she continues while her hands cover Rio's and drag them upward over her ribs. </p><p>"But I can't...I can't go back," Agatha climbs into Rio's lap, one leg between Rio's and the other pressed against the couch so she straddles Rio's thigh. </p><p>Rio can feel the warmth coming off of Agatha in waves and if she looks down she knows she'll be ruined. Rio swears she can feel Agatha's arousal through her underwear and shorts as the omega rocks back and forth, moaning in Rio's ear as the alpha's hips twitch and she slams her eyes shut.</p><p>"Please, I feel like I'm dying," Agatha begs.</p><p>"I can't, Agatha, it's a bad idea."</p><p>"You don't want me?" The omega pouts and Rio instantly feels guilty, catching herself before she leans up to do something dumb like bite Agatha's lip because what a stupid question; yes, she wants her. Bad.</p><p>"Not like this," Rio grasps for her self control, clinging to the remnants of the cigarette smell to kill some of her desire. </p><p>She wants this. It crosses Rio's mind that she could simply give in and it would probably be the best sex of her life. She likes the weight of Agatha against her and if the omega keeps making those little whimpering sounds in her ear, Rio might just come in her pants. </p><p>"Then how?" Agatha asks, her lips brushing against Rio's ear. </p><p>"You can have me however you want," she purrs and Rio's eyes roll back because she can so easily picture every single way she would take her, starting with Agatha riding her to completion. </p><p>Agatha seems to sense Rio's dying resolve. Her hand slips between them high on Rio's thigh and moving toward the hard line of her cock in her shorts.</p><p>A spike of panic breaks through Rio's haze. If Agatha touches her then she's done for; there's no way she'll be able to resist when they're tipping so dangerously close to a precipice they won't be able to return from.</p><p>"I promise I can make it so good for you..." </p><p>Agatha's fingers brush against her and Rio's hand snaps to Agatha's wrist grasping gently but firmly, holding Agatha's hand inches away from her cock.</p><p>"Agatha...Agatha, wait, stop," Rio gasps in a last ditch attempt to appeal to the omega, she's so close to saying fuck it but Rio knows they would both regret it later. She wouldn't be able to take it if Agatha looks at her like a mistake.</p><p>It seems to work when Agatha freezes, shaking under Rio's hand before suddenly her weight is gone and the colder room air hits Rio's front. </p><p>The omega is pressed against the opposite side of the couch, eyes wide and fearful as she trembles. </p><p>"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." she babbles and it's such a sudden shift that Rio is thrown, nearly forgetting her own arousal until she moves and winces.</p><p>"It's okay, it's okay..." Rio breathes.</p><p>"It's not okay!" Rio jumps at Agatha's forceful reply, staring at her quizzically until Agatha's face scrunches like she's in pain. </p><p>"Please...can I have one of the patches?" She asks weakly. </p><p>Rio nods, grateful for a temporary escape and something to do, "Yeah, let me go get..."</p><p>She trails off while she scoots past Agatha, turning her hips away in embarrassment and walking as quickly and as comfortably as she can to the bathroom.</p><p>The patches are on the counter but when the door closes, Rio places both hands on the counter and bends over to catch her breath. </p><p>Okay, so maybe she had been a little too confident about her ability to deal with Agatha's heat. </p><p>Rio turns on the tap and splashes cold water over her face and chest which helps distract her overstimulated body. Her logical mind slowly returns and reluctantly begins to speak sense into the alpha. </p><p>Agatha still smells like her mate. </p><p>
<em>"I want him."</em>
</p><p>Her anger is over taken by a wave of disappointment. Agatha doesn't want her. She wants an alpha. It doesn't matter who. </p><p>It hurts more than Rio expects.</p><p>That thought alone is enough to calm Rio's arousal enough that she can grab one of the patches and return to the living room.</p><p>Agatha is still in the same spot, resting her forehead on a bent knee, breathing even though every so often she shudders and Rio realizes she's crying when she approaches and tears open the sterile packaging. </p><p>Rio sits on the coffee table in front of Agatha and gestures for Agatha to turn her head which she does, exposing the angry, swollen mating mark.</p><p>"That looks...not great. Is it a reaction to the cream or the patch?" Rio asks, carefully lining up the patch to cover as much of the mark and red irritated skin around it as possible. </p><p>"No," Agatha replies. "I thought it might be so I went to bed without the patch. It just got worse."</p><p>Rio grimaces. That explains the late night visit. With nothing to help her fight against her pheromones, Agatha is unable to resist.</p><p>"Is it itchy?" Rio asks, making sure the patch is stuck down.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "Just hurts." </p><p>Rio leans back and crumples the paper packaging. Agatha looks down at her knee, thinking so loud, Rio can almost hear it. She looks so sad that Rio feels her heart breaking for the other woman. </p><p>Agatha's slumped shoulders make her look even smaller; guilt and regret making her retreat into herself until the guilt crystalizes into grief, adding another brick to the wall of her defenses.</p><p>Rio can practically see it happening in real time.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Agatha breathes, voice breaking as she exhales.</p><p>"You stopped, it's okay," Rio reassures but Agatha shakes her head, refusing the comfort.</p><p>"It wouldn't have been right."</p><p>Rio agrees and a small part of her is relieved Agatha thinks that way instead of resenting her for seemingly rejecting her, "It's not your fault, you can't help it right now."</p><p>"It's a poor excuse," Agatha spits, eyes flashing defensively, protecting something buried deep in her soul.</p><p>"Why are you being so hard on yourself?" Rio furrows her brow and ducks her head to search for Agatha's eyes. Agatha avoids her at first, stubbornly hanging on to her anger and denial like a punishment. </p><p>Rio hesitates to touch Agatha again, just in case, but she refuses to let Agatha hide, leaning close enough she knows Agatha can't ignore her.</p><p>"What you're doing is one of the hardest things you can do but you're doing it. Give yourself some credit, even if you slip a little you're still doing really well."</p><p>Agatha folds her arms over her middle and Rio finds it funny she feels like she's scolding the omega instead of encouraging her but Agatha is so unwilling to accept a compliment that Rio feels like the only way Agatha will accept them is to "change the packaging" so to speak. </p><p>Case and point, Agatha bows her head and fidgets in her seat uncomfortably as if getting used to receiving grace for her mistakes.</p><p>Rio wonders if it's a self-standard set too high or because someone, or multiple someones, made her pay dearly when she inevitably stumbled.</p><p>"You want to watch something?" Rio offers and Agatha nods tiredly. </p><p>Rio grabs the blanket off her chair and drapes it over Agatha who tucks it around herself while Rio flips the channel to one of those "how it's made" shows that reliably get Rio to sleep if she's having a hard night. </p><p>Agatha looks like she's half asleep already so when Rio looks over an hour later to find the omega asleep, blanket pulled over her nose, Rio isn't surprised.</p><p>Rio sighs in relief, at least the omega can find some solace in sleep. </p><p>Standing and stretching until her back cracks, Rio closes her laptop and decides to carry Agatha to bed, saving her neck and back from the awkward positioning on the couch.</p><p>Agatha resists waking when Rio lifts her with one arm around her back and the other under her knees, pillowing her head against Rio's chest with the blanket acting as a barrier between them.</p><p>Rio still feels the low simmering desire but more so she feels her chest swell with affection, knowing she is getting dangerously attached to the omega in her arms.</p><p>When she places Agatha in bed, Rio leaves quickly, refusing the temptation to look back; figuring if she doesn't see the angelic image Agatha makes while she slumbers then she can't be haunted by it.</p><p>Closing the door behind her, Rio leaves Agatha to rest, hoping the next time she looks the omega in the eye she won't have a heart attack when she remembers how Agatha felt grinding her cunt against Rio's thigh.</p><p>Her cock twitches and Rio groans, heading to the shower for what feels like the thousandth time in the last few days. </p><p>-------------</p><p>It's not terribly awkward.</p><p>Rio hasn't seen Agatha much since that late night encounter and when they pass each other in the hall or the kitchen, Agatha blushes and darts her eyes away.</p><p>Rio feels like they're back to the beginning, tiptoeing around each other and it only reinforces Rio's thoughts that it would have been a <em>very bad</em> idea to sleep with the omega. </p><p>Eventually she comes to the conclusion that she would rather deal with the awkwardness than the consequences of falling into bed together. </p><p>Still, Agatha seems to be avoiding her which would be fine but Agatha hasn't answered her door and normally she comes out to eat at least once during the day.</p><p>Rio paces outside Agatha's door, debating what to do.</p><p>She wants to respect Agatha's space, seeing her room as a sort of sanctuary from everyone, including Rio, but at the same time, her concern nags at her. </p><p>Would Agatha be angry enough not to eat? She didn't seem that angry. She did seem really sad though. Would...would Agatha have hurt herself? </p><p>Rio shakes the thought away but it refuses to leave her alone.</p><p>Agatha wouldn't do that. She's too stubborn to do something after doing all she's done to get through her heat. She might, however, have hurt herself on accident...</p><p>It's too much for Rio to deal with. She needs to check just this one time and if Agatha is irate then at least Rio will know she's okay.</p><p>Rio opens the door as silently as possible and pokes her head in, looking around for any signs of life and spotting a lump in the bed, chestnut hair sticking out wildly from under the covers.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio whispers and Agatha remains still, the slight up and down of her breathing the only sign of life from the omega. Rio slides the rest of her body into the room and approaches the bed, slowly placing her hand on where she assumes Agatha's shoulder is. </p><p>"Agatha?" The woman stirs and Rio notices the beads of sweat along her hairline and the bleary haze over her eyes when her eyelids finally crack open a few milimeters. </p><p>"Hey, you okay?" Rio leans over, keeping her voice low. "You've been sleeping for most of the day."</p><p>Agatha blinks once, then again. When she tries to sit up, her eyes go wide and Rio moves out of the way just in time for Agatha to scramble past her and to the bathroom, leaning over in time to retch into the toilet.</p><p>"Oh shit," Rio jogs after her and leans over Agatha, brushing her hair back when another wave of nausea hits her and she leans over the ceramic bowl again. </p><p>As Rio rubs Agatha's back in the small bathroom she realizes something unpleasant. </p><p>Agatha stinks.</p><p>Rio scrunches her nose, thankful Agatha can't see her. There's barely any hint of her usual scent; it's buried under layers of ash and sickness and cigarette butts mixed in with something biological that's close to the smell of infection. </p><p>Agatha's body is rejecting her mate, Rio realizes.</p><p>Rio leans further forward to check out the mating mark on Agatha's neck and the puffy tissue looks like it's deflated and raw, like a popped watery blister. The skin is still red but it weeps fluid and a little bit of blood as Agatha's body turns on her mate, forcing him out like a foreign body and ravaging Agatha's internal homeostasis. </p><p>Rio tucks Agatha's hair into the back of her shirt and searches for a washcloth and some sterile gauze. After locating both, Rio wets the cloth and hands it to Agatha to wipe her face while she uses the gauze to clean up the mark on Agatha's neck.</p><p>The nausea seems to have passed for now so Rio tries to urge Agatha back to her room.</p><p>"Come on, back to bed," Rio wraps an arm around Agatha's waist, nudging her gently.</p><p>Agatha groans and makes no move to stand, "No, leave me here," she whines.</p><p>"You can't stay here, Agatha, you'll be uncomfortable," Rio bites her bottom lip. It figures Agatha would be dramatic when she's not feeling well. </p><p>"Do you want to change your clothes?" Rio tries another strategy and this time Agatha nods. </p><p>Rio helps her up and leads her back to her room, grabbing a new set of pants and a shirt and putting them on the corner of the bed. </p><p>Rio turns around while Agatha changes and she hears her shuffling and moving around, making her fidget while she stares at the ground.</p><p>"Can I watch tv?" Agatha croaks pathetically and Rio turns around slowly, making sure Agatha is dressed before facing her again. The omega wraps her blanket over her shoulders, immediately cocooned and swallowed by fluffy fabric. </p><p>Rio's chest squeezes again.</p><p>"Yeah, come on. How's your balance?" </p><p>"S'okay."</p><p>Rio holds her arm out just in case Agatha wobbles but she successfully navigates herself down the hallway and claims the couch while Rio makes a detour to the kitchen, filling a glass with water and grabbing a large plastic bowl in case Agatha feels nauseous again. Rio puts both in front of Agatha before taking a seat in the leather chair to her left.</p><p>"Drink some water."</p><p>Agatha obeys while Rio uses the remote to select the last episode of the show Agatha had been watching and hitting play.</p><p>They watch as couples are interviewed, setting the stage for the potential pairings that have been decided by matchmaker based on personality and data. If the contestants can figure out who their match is, they walk away with cash and love. Supposedly. </p><p>It would be great for Rio if stats on a paper and panel interviews could tell her whether someone is compatible. The guesswork would be taken out of dating and Rio wouldn't have to deal with heartbreak when inevitably something goes wrong after she gets invested. </p><p>For a while Rio floated around, not necessarily in relationships more like flings, that she hangs on to until they are no longer fun. There is no guesswork in a one night stand and that makes it easier for a while until Rio realizes she is simply going through the motions, wanting emotional connection in addition to physical to feel satisfied.</p><p>She's drawn from her musings when Agatha talks over a tall leggy blonde in a bikini.</p><p>"Thank you...for not," she speaks haltingly, the words sticking in Agatha's throat before she swallows and tries again.</p><p>"You could have taken advantage and you didn't." </p><p>It takes Rio a second to catch up to where Agatha's mind lingers and to formulate a response.</p><p>"You said it yourself, it wouldn't have been right," Rio points out.</p><p>"Never stopped an alpha before," Agatha mumbles under her breath making Rio's ears perk.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Nothing," Agatha brushes her off but Rio is a little more alert, her sixth sense stirring to life.</p><p>"Agatha..." Rio says slowly so there is no mistaking what she says. </p><p>"I couldn't do that to you."</p><p>The blanket shifts and Rio assumes Agatha is shrugging, "I could have dealt with it. You're not...a terrible option."</p><p>"Talk about an ego death..." Rio huffs, half-serious. </p><p>"You know what I mean," Agatha grumbles and Rio feels something bordering on indignant rising to the surface. </p><p>"I don't. That's why I couldn't do it," Rio replies a little more severely than she intends but it catches Agatha's attention. </p><p>"If we were to sleep together I wouldn't want it to be because I'm not a terrible option."</p><p>The corners of Agatha's mouth turn down,"It sounds worse when you say it."</p><p>The omega looks chastised and Rio takes pity.</p><p>"I know what you meant," Rio gives her a side glance. </p><p>"You deserve better than that."</p><p>Agatha picks at the blanket, rubbing it between her fingers and tracing the stitching. She's sitting in her unease again.</p><p>"You'd be good on the show," Agatha says after a long silence.</p><p>Rio takes the distractionary bait, "Not this one, I hate the co-host."</p><p>It's true, every time there's an after show the co-host is pushing for couples to have a baby which is stupid when everyone knows they'll break up in about three months.</p><p>"Maybe the one where they're not allowed to touch or they lose money," Agatha ponders. </p><p>"You'd be good at that, with your whole... righteousness thing."</p><p>Rio laughs and tilts her head in confusion, "My what?"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "You know, you're...good."</p><p>"Thanks, I think?" Rio looks like she's thinking about it and Agatha glares at her without any real irritation.</p><p>"Nevermind, you're infuriating," Agatha sighs heavily.</p><p>Rio grins, "Fever is making you delirious."</p><p>"You're right, I called you a good person," Agatha mocks.</p><p>Rio places a hand on her chest in offense, "The ego is dead, stop kicking it."</p><p>"Good thing you have plenty to spare," Agatha gives her a look and Rio smirks and shakes her head.</p><p>"Aw man, rewind, I missed what happened with Derek and Angela," Rio gestures to the remote and Agatha presses her lips together and rewinds as requested. </p><p>They're quiet as Derek and Angela declare their connection after one day together, cuddling on a beach bungalow and talking about mating in the future.</p><p>"Have you ever had a mate?" Agatha wonders out loud. </p><p>Rio rests her elbow on the armrest and scratches at her scalp, taking her hair down from the ponytail she's been wearing all day. </p><p>"No," she answers easily. "Came close once but," Rio shrugs, "she cheated."</p><p>"Did you freak out?" Agatha asks in surprise. An omega cheating on an alpha isn't uncommon but in Agatha's experience, cheating isn't received well, particularly by possessive alphas.</p><p>Rio winces and inhales through her teeth.</p><p>"I definitely got depressed," she chuckles self-depreciatingly. "Lots of really sad music playlists."</p><p>Agatha blinks. "What about her?"</p><p>"We broke up, I moved out and got this place," Rio gestures around her.</p><p>"You weren't angry?" Agatha narrows her eyes.</p><p>"I mean, yeah," Rio rubs the back of her neck.</p><p>"I was hurt but I can't really stop someone from cheating if they're going to do it."</p><p>Agatha stares at Rio like she's some kind of mythical creature. "Does nothing bother you?"</p><p>Rio looks up in surprise, "What do you mean?"</p><p>"I mean you're so calm all the time, did you moonlight as a therapist or something?" Agatha asks with some exasperation but if she sits with it long enough she knows she'll find jealousy, wishing she could wield her composure as easily as the alpha seems to.</p><p>Rio rests her head against her hand, half-watching the show as it transitions to showing the contestants getting drunk and flirting the next night.</p><p>"I mean, I do go to therapy," she confesses. "Kinda started as job mandated but I just... stuck with it," Rio glances at Agatha. "Figured it was good to deal with my general crap."</p><p>Agatha huffs and smirks. "I think I have enough general crap to keep a therapist employed for years."</p><p>Rio chuckles in sympathy, "Well if you ever want a recommendation, my therapist would enjoy the job security."</p><p>Agatha snorts, amused. </p><p>On screen, Derek talks to another contestant, Sarah, lamenting in his confessional about the difficult choice he needs to make between two beautiful women; describing his attachment to Angela but definitely enjoying Sarah's "banging bod".</p><p>"I don't think I'm calm all the time," Rio muses.</p><p>"Could've fooled me," Agatha tosses back.</p><p>Rio smirks then grows contemplative. </p><p>"I think it looks like I'm calm," Rio thinks out loud and Agatha's ear turns to the alpha though her eyes stay on the screen. </p><p>"I'm not sure how else to be. If I'm not calm then..." Rio dissociates for a few seconds, gaze vacant and shining.</p><p>"I'll end up killing someone."</p><p>Agatha's eyes cut to the alpha staring into the middle distance. She isn't scared of Rio's confession, not for herself anyway, but she feels like she just got a glimpse of the darkness that lingers like a mark on her soul. </p><p>"I don't think you'd hurt anyone who didn't deserve it."</p><p>Rio hums in agreement and slowly drags her large eyes to Agatha, unblinking and entirely solemn.</p><p>"He would have deserved it."</p><p>Agatha swallows thickly. The pull to defend her mate isn't there and for the first time, Agatha feels like she's almost on the other side of this whole ordeal. </p><p>"Yes, he would have."</p><p>Rio blinks rapidly and seems to break free of her trance, a little bashful but choosing to gloss over the moment with a shy smile. </p><p>Agatha burrows further into her blanket to hide her own smile, secretly reveling in the feeling of protection and the sentiment that Rio cares enough to do something.</p><p>"She's gonna dump him," Rio nods to the screen where Derek is fighting for his life and pleading with Angela to understand why he needed to explore his options. </p><p>"Angela and Sarah should get together," Agatha comments.</p><p>"Much better," Rio agrees.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It takes Agatha about five days to feel human again.</p><p>The first few days are filled with nausea, fever, and body chills that have Agatha sweating though she refuses to give up her blanket as her teeth chatter, wrapping herself tightly as she shivers.</p><p>Rio worries and falls into the caretaker role without question, trying to keep Agatha hydrated and fed though the omega is not really able to stomach more than clear broth and soft bread.</p><p>For a few days, Agatha moves temporarily to the couch in the living room where Rio can check on her, taking her temperature and wiping her down with a cool cloth when the fever climbs higher, tossing and turning with fever dreams in her sleep. </p><p>Her fever breaks on the fourth day.</p><p>When Agatha wakes up, her body doesn't hurt as much and the nausea is no more than an unpleasant memory. Rio helps her to the shower when she declares she feels disgusting and grabs Agatha a fresh change of clothes to leave on the sink. </p><p>Rio takes the time to wash Agatha's blanket, happy to be rid of the cigarette and sick smell that clings to the fabric.</p><p>When Agatha emerges, freshly showered, she feels a little more alert and when Rio offers food, she eats her first full meal of toast and plain eggs. </p><p>Agatha recovers, feeling lighter and more level headed than she has in weeks. The pull toward her mate is nothing more than a weak thread, worn thin and ragged and growing weaker by the day. </p><p>The mark on her neck dries out and starts to scab over, and if it weren't for the gel cream, Agatha would be clawing and slapping at it, annoyed with the itching as it heals. </p><p>She uses ice packs, pressing them against her mark, desperate for relief as she resists the urge to pick at it, not wanting to make any potential scars worse. If she has to look in the mirror and be reminded of her mistake, she wants it to be as faint as possible.</p><p>Agatha grows restless as her energy returns.</p><p>She's going stir crazy. </p><p>Watching her shows are only so distracting and scrolling through her phone makes Agatha mind-numbingly bored after a while, so it's a relief when, a few days later, Rio informs her the arrest warrants have finally come back signed. </p><p>Agatha's heart rate spikes and she feels the adrenaline building in her gut and fanning out toward her hands and legs, making her fidget, swaying and shifting her weight from foot to foot.</p><p>"When?" Her eyes dart to Rio's. </p><p>"Tomorrow," Rio replies, watching Agatha start to pace like a caged animal.</p><p>"Are you doing it?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Rio hadn't been selected to be a part of the arrest teams but it's for the best. She would rather be with Agatha than have to worry about dealing with angry, entitled alphas.</p><p>"Will you know when he's arrested?" Agatha looks like she's plotting.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Agatha bites on her thumbnail as she paces and Rio feels like a soldier waiting for orders. When she finally makes a decision, Agatha turns to Rio and places her hands on the table.</p><p>"When he's arrested, I want to go to the house. I want to pack before he makes bail. And I want to go to the bank."</p><p>Rio is faced with a determined Agatha, and she nods, a swelling of pride coming from her alpha at the resilience of her omega.</p><p>The alpha catches herself, the woman standing across her is not her omega.</p><p>Rio shakes it off and focuses on what is inevitably going to be a busy week.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The arrest is quieter than Agatha expects but only because the media hasn't had a chance to sink their teeth into the story. </p><p>She feels the urgency to take advantage of the calm before the storm, nervous energy running on a loop through her body as familiar scenery passes the passenger window, repeating to herself that Ralph will not be there to calm her surprisingly defensive omega.</p><p>When she opens the door, Rio follows behind her for peace of mind and the first thing Agatha notices is the smell. </p><p>There's the familiar whiffs of patchouli and tobacco but it has no effect her. She might as well be walking past a smoke shop store front; her head doesn't even turn and she moves easily into the space that is both familiar and foreign. </p><p>Encouraged, Agatha moves with purpose, finding a suitcase and filling it quickly. She clears the bathroom of her things; makeup and toiletries mostly, then she moves on to her closet and drawers next, breathing a sigh of relief that her clothes are still there. </p><p>The small comfort means more than Agatha expects, feeling more like herself, rebuilding from the remains, little by little.</p><p>In total it takes Agatha three hours to remove herself from the house she thought she'd grow old in; staring as she stands in the foyer while memories from a past life flicker past her mind's eye.</p><p>So many dreams born in one place only to die before they ever took a breath, strangled and starved, finding no purchase in the barren foundation of her marriage.</p><p>Agatha isn't religious but she does take a moment to mourn the happiness she once found in her home, placing her hand on the door frame and looking up toward the ceiling, taking one last look, saying goodbye to an old friend.</p><p>"You did your best," she whispers, eyes welling with tears as a deep sorrow settles in her chest. </p><p>Agatha feels a little crazy talking to a house, but she can't help it when she's poured so much of her energy and love and hope into one place that it feels alive; a piece of her soul left behind to forever haunt her former life.</p><p>"Goodbye."</p><p>When they leave, Agatha doesn't look back.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha's bank account is the easiest task to accomplish, transferring her money from her and Ralph's joint account to a new one under her name only. Agatha is careful to document everything she does, anticipating what she will need once she officially files for divorce or in case Ralph decides to cause trouble.</p><p>With access to her money, a large part of Agatha relaxes. It's a cruel reality but without resources, she's powerless and there's nothing she hates more than feeling powerless. </p><p>Her mind wanders to Rio's mother, grimacing with sympathy and new found admiration. </p><p>All that's left on her to do list is call Jen.</p><p>It takes Agatha two days to work up the courage to actually press send.</p><p>In the meantime, Agatha watches the news, catching the same clip of Ralph and a few others walking along with FBI agents to a car. No handcuffs unfortunately, but the public humiliation is enough as she watches VersaRX stock plummet while clients and partners alike work to distance themselves from the company. </p><p>Predictably, Ralph and the other partners make bail, still rich enough to buy more time to try and salvage what they can of their reputation and personal wealth.</p><p>When Agatha initially brings up the idea to Rio of inviting Jen to finally tell her about leaving Ralph, Agatha half hopes Rio will reject the idea in the same way Ralph would just so she has an excuse not to call the other omega. </p><p>Unfortunately, Rio is as accommodating as she always is, encouraging Agatha to reach out to Jen and graciously opening her home for Agatha's use. </p><p>Damn her.</p><p>Now there's nothing stopping Agatha from calling her best friend. </p><p><em>"This is Jennifer." </em> </p><p>The other omega sounds professional and classy, voice even and firm though she still manages to sound warm. Agatha would laugh if she didn't feel like choking.  </p><p>"Jen," Agatha croaks, shattering any resolve she has to be strong.</p><p>
<em>"Holy shit, Agatha! Where are you? Are you okay? What's going on?" </em>
</p><p>Jen's questions are immediate and rapid fire but Agatha would rather have this conversation in person than over the phone. </p><p>A masochistic part of Agatha feels she deserves to see Jen's disappointment; if Agatha is ready to swallow a bite of humble pie then Jen should get to tell Agatha she was right in person.</p><p>"Can you come over? I'm...I'm not at home."</p><p>Jen's voice is less frantic but the thread of concern still carries through the phone and the part of Agatha that longs for her best friend grows stronger. </p><p>
<em>"No shit! Ralph was here two weeks ago demanding I stop hiding you and when I tried to call you, he answered. What the fuck, Agatha?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha grimaces, she knew it was likely Ralph would go to Jen but she had hoped by some miracle he would leave her alone. But Jen is an omega; Ralph would have felt comfortable confronting her and he's been waiting for a chance to tear into Jen for some time.</p><p>"...I left him."</p><p>A cry of celebration rings in Agatha's ear followed by the sound of shuffling and keys.</p><p>
<em>"Oh thank fuck! Where are you?" </em>
</p><p>Agatha gives Jen Rio's address, biting her nail the entire time. She needs to stop that before she rips her nail off, Agatha thinks to herself.</p><p>
<em>"Okay...GPS says forty-five minutes. See you soon."</em>
</p><p>"See you."</p><p>Jen hangs up and Agatha's nerves double, standing to pace and going right back to biting her nail.</p><p>Jen is on her way. She feels like she needs to prepare but what for, she has no idea. Agatha has barely sought approval from anyone in her life; not even her mother makes Agatha this nervous. </p><p>Because Agatha knows what her mother wants and would never approve of anything outside of her narrow margins. Even if Agatha were to conform to her mother's wishes her effort would never be enough. There's no point in trying for Evanora's approval when it remains perpetually out of reach.</p><p>On the other hand, Jen actually cares about what Agatha wants. She doesn't care what Agatha does as long as she does it well and happily. </p><p>Some how, that feels like more pressure, feeling like she's disappointing her friend if she's suddenly not sure about what she wants anymore. Agatha knows nothing but fire and scorn when she doesn't clear the high bar of expectation set for her and she expects nothing less from Jen.</p><p>Tires in the driveway break Agatha from her thoughts, wiping her sweaty hands on her leggings as she prepares to face the music. </p><p>Agatha opens the door just as Jen steps up to the welcome mat and the other woman wastes no time pulling Agatha into a tight hug. Agatha closes her eyes, squeezing Jen back tightly, trying to pour all her feelings into one embrace.</p><p>Jen pulls back after a long moment, starting in on the questions immediately once Agatha leads her inside the living room. The woman's large eyes scan every surface, no doubt making base judgements about Rio based on her taste.</p><p>"Whose house is this?" Jen touches one of the ivy leaves to see if it's real before joining Agatha on the couch.</p><p>"It's, um, Rio Vidal, I'm staying with her for a little bit."</p><p>"Is she why you left?"</p><p>Jen places her handbag in the leather chair, her rose pink outfit sticking out in the darkened space almost comically.</p><p>"Sort of," Agatha struggles with where to start, twisting her hands anxiously in her lap.</p><p>"So, what, you had an affair and finally saw the light?" </p><p>Agatha almost forgot how straightforward Jen is. Having spent at least the last three years dancing around ingenuous comments hiding nefarious intent, Jen's candor is refreshing, reminding Agatha she's safe with the other omega.</p><p>Agatha also forgot how quickly Jen can jump to a conclusion.</p><p>"What? No!"</p><p>"You said she's part of the reason you left!" Jen waves her hand as if it's the most obvious explantion.</p><p>"No, not like that, she..." Agatha sighs and pushes her hair behind her shoulders, not sure where to start explaining how she ended up in the home of a federal agent investigating the alleged crimes of her husband.</p><p>"Rio's an FBI agent working in the VersaRX case," Agatha starts, figuring it's the easiest place to begin.</p><p>"Okay..." Jen squints, finally slowing down enough for Agatha to speak uninterrupted. </p><p>Agatha takes a breath and tells Jen a severely edited version of how Ralph seemingly transformed into a different person over the last year. Agatha can't bring herself to describe the details of what Ralph did that night, but she does tell Jen about the bruises and the threats and the rules she needed to follow to put Ralph at ease.</p><p>It's enough for Jen to look disgusted the entire time and though Agatha knows it isn't directed at her, she can't help but feel so stupidly naive hearing herself describe the awful behavior she had excused for so long. </p><p>Agatha prides herself on her intelligence yet she ignored every red flag.</p><p>It's crushing.</p><p>"I had to leave," Agatha finishes, the plea in her voice begging Jen to understand, to forgive her for being so dumb and trying to appeal as one omega to another. </p><p>Maybe that's why Agatha is so nervous. If her best friend, a fellow omega, confirms the worst parts of Agatha then she's forced to accept what her mother has always insisted is true; Agatha was born evil; her soul malformed and wrong.</p><p>The lump in Agatha's throat hurts to swallow past and the anticipation of Jen's reaction forces tears to her eyes. Agatha fidgets, wishing Jen would just yell at her and get it over with. </p><p>"Did you tell anyone?" Jen exhales after a long pause. </p><p>Agatha braces herself and shakes her head.</p><p>"No. I knew he'd go to you first, I didn't want to put you in danger."</p><p>"Well yeah," Jen rolls her eyes, "It makes sense not to stay with me but why didn't you tell me?"</p><p>Agatha sinks into herself.</p><p>"I know you hated him," Agatha's breath catches, turbulent emotions rising to the surface as the physical and emotional toll of everything she has been carrying threatens to crush her.</p><p>Agatha starts to cry in earnest, tears falling faster down her chin and neck while she tries to speak through shuddering breaths. </p><p>"I...I wasn't ready to hear 'I told you so'," she sobs, forcefully wiping at her eyes until they're red and puffy.</p><p>"I should have listened to you," Agatha gasps, "I'm so sorry I didn't."</p><p>Agatha's hands cover her face while her lungs hiccup out of rhythm, succumbing to the wave of emotion she's held back for long. </p><p>She cries for her failures, perceived and real, for the pieces she carved out of herself to fit into a mold never made for her, for the mother she hasn't bothered to call, who turned on her the moment she took her first breath, for the girl she was whose hope was killed by an unfair world...</p><p>Long fingers tangle in Agatha's hair and cradle her face until Agatha finally looks up at her best friend whose tears mirror her own, shining over her dark skin and highlighting the conviction that sparks in Jen's gaze. </p><p>"I'm sorry I ever made you think I hate him more than I love you." </p><p>Agatha wails and throws herself forward to embrace the other woman who hugs her tightly as the gulf between them is finally bridged. </p><p>"He never deserved you, do you hear me?" Jen murmurs fiercely in her ear and Agatha clings to her tighter, not giving a damn if Jen is pissed about wrinkles in her clothes later. </p><p>"You were destined to outshine him even back then. He's always needed you more than you need him. He knows it and now you know it too."</p><p>Agatha can't help but give voice to the dark corners of her mind that creep forward.</p><p>"Not according to Evanora."</p><p>"We both know your mother's a bitch," Jen shoots her down with ease, Evanora nothing more than a noisy mosquito buzzing next to her ear to be shooed away. In that moment, she's Agatha's hero.</p><p>Jen rests her head on Agatha's when they're all cried out. The two women hold each other, both needing the comfort after so much emotional exhaustion. </p><p>"You're really leaving him?" Jen asks quietly, needing to be sure. </p><p>"That's the other reason I called," Agatha's voice is muffled where she leans on Jen's shoulder. "I need a divorce attorney."</p><p>Agatha's firm doesn't deal in divorce but Jen's does; Agatha remembers only because Jen has offered their services many times over the years.</p><p>"Done," Jen replies too quickly. Agatha wouldn't put it past Jen to have mapped out her entire divorce if only to fantasize. </p><p>"I know exactly who to call. She'll put the fear of god in him. I'll give you her email before I leave."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"I'm happy you're safe," There's a finality in Jen's tone that tells Agatha she's ready to move on, picking up the loose ends of their friendship and braiding them together, continuing like nothing about Agatha has changed. </p><p>It might seem severe but Agatha is grateful; her life is in upheaval and Jen remains a rock in the middle of a moving stream.</p><p>"Now, please tell me g-woman has alcohol."</p><p>-------------</p><p>When Rio comes home she finds Agatha and Jen cuddling under a blanket on the couch, hard ciders in hand and watching some god awful design show about wedding dresses.</p><p>"You should get a divorce dress," Jen says just as Rio shuts the door, drawing Agatha's attention before she glances at her phone. </p><p>"Hey, sorry, didn't realize it was that late," Agatha leans forward and pauses the show, setting her bottle on the coffee table as Jen stands and stretches.</p><p>"No worries," Rio offers Agatha a soft smile. </p><p>"Hi, I'm Rio," The agent greets Jen while Jen is already busy studying the alpha, sizing her up and making mental judgements behind calculating eyes.</p><p>"Oh, I've heard all about you Agent Vidal," Jen practically purrs and Agatha shoots her a look that Rio doesn't understand but has Jen grinning.</p><p>"Uh...that's good? Did you want to stay for dinner?" Rio decides to play dumb, not wanting to mess up Agatha's time with her best friend when it's the happiest she's ever seen the omega.</p><p>"I should go, but next time, for sure." Jen picks up her bag and stops next to Rio on her way out, her height and elegant curve of her neck making Jen look regal as she looks down at the alpha. </p><p>"Thank you, for taking care of her stubborn ass," Jen nods to Agatha who glares back.</p><p>"My pleasure," Rio chuckles. </p><p>"I'm sure it is," A single eyebrow lifts and Jen's grin is predatory.</p><p>"Uh..." Rio's eyes dart from Jen to Agatha, hoping Agatha can read the SOS in her eyes, feeling like she's missing something that Jen is especially gleeful about.</p><p>"Goodbye, Jen! Talk to you later!" Agatha gives Jen another look and rushes her toward the door.</p><p>"See you soon. Goodnight Agent Vidal."</p><p>Rio waves and the door closes, Agatha gathering the empty bottles and taking them to the recycling.</p><p>"So that's Jen," Agatha sighs but doesn't hide the fond smile that makes her face soften and glow, making Rio smile in turn.</p><p>"She seems nice," Rio offers.</p><p>"She's a bitch," Agatha laughs.</p><p>"I thought she's your best friend?" Rio tilts her head in confusion.</p><p>"She is. I missed her."</p><p>Rio opens the fridge and grabs a bottle from the lower shelf. </p><p>"I'm gonna need cider for this."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Two days later, Agatha is in the middle of an email to her new divorce attorney. The faster she files, the faster she can get back on her suppressants and birth control and hopefully beg Lilia for her job back. </p><p>Her phone dings when she gets a text from Rio. </p><p>
<em>"Hey are you at home?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha furrows her brow, Rio doesn't normally text her when she's at work.</p><p>
<em>"Yes"</em>
</p><p>Three little dots appear as Rio types a response and Agatha waits curiously.</p><p>
<em>"Okay, I'll be home in 15"</em>
</p><p>Agatha's thumbs fly over her keyboard, her response immediate as her omega worries something is wrong with the alpha.</p><p>
<em>"Everything okay?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Have something to show you, would be better if we could go to my office."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Alright, I'll get ready."</em>
</p><p>Agatha is intrigued and worried at the same time. If Rio is asking for Agatha to go to her office, it must either be important or dire, or both. </p><p>Agatha quickly changes her clothes and tries to tame her hair. By the time she's done, Rio is pulling into the driveway and Agatha meets her outside.</p><p>Immediately Agatha is on alert when she sees the tension in Rio's shoulders and the way Rio's eyes strain when she smiles sets Agatha on edge.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Rio sticks her hands in her pockets and her mouth pinches in frustration. Agatha frowns and searches Rio's face, confused by the smell of kindling and wet earth that clashes, hinting at the unease that sits below the surface. </p><p>"I can't tell you right now, it could complicate...things." </p><p>Agatha's expression drops and her uncertainty multiplies tenfold. Something must change in her scent because Rio steps forward to place a hand on Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>"I'm sorry, please trust me," Rio tries to ease Agatha's distress but she can see the suspicion plainly on her face, warring with Agatha's defensive nature and her desire to trust.</p><p>"When we get there my partner and I will take you to an interrogation room and explain everything."</p><p>Agatha's eyes flash, "Am I under suspicion?" </p><p>Rio shakes her head, "No, not at all. It's just better if it's on record."</p><p>Rio squeezes Agatha's shoulder, "I promise."</p><p>It's Rio's promise that reassures Agatha enough to agree, wondering what fresh hell could be waiting for her now.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"Agatha this is Agent Wu-Gulliver, my partner." </p><p>Agatha nods to the shorter alpha she remembers from the last encounter with Ralph in what used to be her home. Alice has a spice smell that hovers around cinnamon and cayenne that actually blends well with Rio's earthy, woodsy notes, together presenting a unified and well established front. </p><p>It's a testament to the strength of their partnership.</p><p>"Nice to see you, Ms. Harkness," Alice nods, her smile genuine and familiar which makes Agatha wonder just how much Alice knows about her. She gets the feeling Alice is the more social of the two, leading while Rio hangs back and assesses.</p><p>"Call me Agatha, please."</p><p>Alice nods and takes a seat at the plain office desk, joining Agatha and Rio with a dark brown folder that Agatha eyes suspiciously.  </p><p>"Thank you for coming in, we appreciate your time."</p><p>Alice puts the folder on the table, leaving it closed for now. Rio's body is half turned in her chair, right elbow resting on the table and playing with a pen between her fingers.</p><p>Now that Agatha knows better, the seemingly non-chalant display Rio paints is anything but calm. The fidgeting alone is a physical manifestation of whatever is occupying the alpha's thoughts to the point of distraction.</p><p>"Before we begin," Alice starts, "I'd like to confirm, have you ever participated in a drug trial?"</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Alice nods, "Have you ever consented to be considered for a drug trial verbally or otherwise?"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Agatha feels dread pooling in her chest.</p><p>"In the last three years have you been on any prescription medication?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Which ones?"</p><p>"Amphreproxadine suppressants and Apri for birth control."</p><p>"Nothing else? No supplements, gummy vitamins, health shakes, mixers...anything you might have taken on a consistent basis?"</p><p>Agatha glances at Rio who looks up at her from under dark lashes, arms crossing tightly over her chest. Her body coils, all tension and small twitches like the alpha might jump at the slightest provocation. </p><p>"No."</p><p>Alice reaches for the folder and opens it, removing paper-clipped bunches of paper.</p><p>At first glance, there are text message print outs, graphs, data collection, and notes. Her eyes scan quickly trying to find the common thread and relevance to her. None of it looks familiar.</p><p>"What am I looking at?" Agatha looks up at Alice, one eyebrow rising in question.</p><p>Alice shuffles some of the papers, placing a printed series of texts from Ralph to a number she doesn't recognize in front of her to read.</p><p>"We believe you might have been involved in initial drug trials for a medication meant to target and enhance base omega characteristics."</p><p>
<em>"Need a refill on 20mg."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"For A or B?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"A. Continuing. BP within range."</em>
</p><p>Agatha starts to breathe faster and the dread thickens and congeals into a misshapen lump that sits at the bottom of her stomach.</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>Alice picks up another paper and points to a highlighted section, "In the same way suppressants are meant to cancel out pheromones, this is meant to do the opposite and make an omega more sensitive to them. More submissive."</p><p>Agatha licks her lips, "For what purpose?"</p><p>"This is the same drug we found moving through the omega trafficking ring. We believe it's to make omegas more...accepting to customers."</p><p>Agatha has no tears left, only fury that flares, sparking like flint off of her dread.</p><p>"I haven't taken any pills besides the suppressants and birth control," she reiterates, questioning and fitting pieces together, waiting for the last bit of understanding so she can zoom out and view the entire picture.</p><p>"It's water soluble," Rio says, speaking for the first time since the start of the interview, her foot shaking while she stares at the opposite wall before glancing at Agatha out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>Agatha's heart beats in her throat making her entire body thrum. </p><p>Agatha knows. </p><p>Immediately she knows and it's unbelievable but the evidence sits in front of her and she trusts Rio to tell her the truth; Rio who looks at her with sadness and fury, grinding her teeth and pressing her lips together. </p><p>"Tea," Agatha whispers.</p><p>"Pardon?" Alice's voice is loud in Agatha's ears.</p><p>Agatha thinks back, her married life dictacted by familiar routine; work, dinner, tea, watching television while Ralph goes upstairs. Scrolling on his phone. </p><p>She looks down at the data, the name under "subject" blocked out but the surrounding information; her birthday, height, age, weight... everything else is her.</p><p>"Tea," Agatha repeats, a fraction louder. "My hus- Ralph made me tea every night after dinner."</p><p>Rio's face falls into a perfect mask of apathy, round eyes blackened and dead, no trace of the warm honey brown left, just a dark abyss that makes Agatha shudder.</p><p>"And how long has he done that?" Alice pushes the interview forward, serving as the anchor and keeping Agatha focused, searching her memory for anything of use she can offer the agents.</p><p>"Three years, maybe," Agatha looks down at one of the notes written under 'observations'; <em>Willful, especially resistant, no observable change on 10mg dosage. Recommend 10mg increase. </em></p><p>"He was being considered for promotion," Agatha keeps reading. </p><p>
<em>Mood swings, lethargy, observed physical sensitivity, successful copulation increase 2x - 4x. Recommend continuing 20mg.</em>
</p><p>"He got picked to work on a high profile project. He wanted to make it up to me for working so much."</p><p>It's then that the depth of Ralph's betrayal is made crystal clear. </p><p>Agatha never truly knew her mate.</p><p>Ralph had been smart enough to succeed where other alpha's failed by disguising himself and reflecting Agatha's desires back at her like a mirror, making her believe that what she saw in him was the reality, hiding his true self.</p><p>Would she have eventually compromised little by little until she no longer recognized the person staring back at her? </p><p>"Did he tell you about the project?" Alice asks.</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together in a tight line. </p><p>"No. Nothing."</p><p>"Do you recall feeling any different during that time?"</p><p>Agatha looks down at the collected notes.</p><p>"I'm not sure."</p><p>"Any change in your husband's behavior that you noticed?"</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. She hadn't suspected anything. Her sixth sense never sounded during all that time she was supposedly in marital bliss. </p><p>"Just working more. He said he couldn't tell me anything."</p><p>Agatha recalls Ralph's furious and spiteful face inches from hers, spittle leaving his lips as he confesses as far back as their wedding day,<em> I hope you can tame her.</em></p><p>Ralph had literally tried. Agatha questions every time she bit her tongue and gave in, wondering if her decisions were her own or if the drug in her system swayed her free will. </p><p>A headache starts behind her ears, overwhelmed by the information given to her. She wishes he had simply cheated. What other secrets tied to Agatha are floating about, waiting to be plucked from the air and used against her?</p><p>Her mind flashes to Ralph's phone. Her photos.</p><p>If they have Ralph's phone, the agents would have seen everything. </p><p>Humiliation burns up her neck and through her face.</p><p>Agatha rests her elbows on the table and presses her fingers into her temples, closing her eyes as her subconscious wrestles with a handful of emotions fighting for dominance with Agatha in the middle playing referee. </p><p>"Sorry, can I...can we be done?"</p><p>"Of course," Alice nods understandingly. </p><p>"If you have any questions or remember anything else please feel free to contact us."</p><p>The shorter alpha stands and collects the evidence, filing the papers away neatly. Funny how something so benign as a folder can hold enough venom to paralyze and shock her system.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>Alice leans toward Rio and murmurs something Agatha can't hear. Rio's only reaction is to sigh heavily through her nose and nod once before Alice leaves the two of them alone. </p><p>"Home?"</p><p>Agatha nods, not trusting herself to speak and rises from her chair to follow Rio out.</p><p>The agent leads the way, driving Agatha back home in silence, clutching at the steering wheel until her knuckles turn white. </p><p>Agatha wonders what Rio thinks. She's had a deeper dive into her life on paper that others would never get. On paper, Agatha is a mess and she recalls Ralph's words. </p><p><em>"You think anyone will want a pre-claimed omega?"</em> </p><p>Agatha told him she didn't care and if she works at it Agatha can shove it down but the thought of her being 'ruined' might actually have real world consequences. </p><p>Starting with the alpha next to her.</p><p>The alpha smells like a camp fire; not the soft crackling of smoke and kindling but a raging pit, snapping logs on hungry flames, threatening and just barely under control.</p><p>"I think I'm gonna need that therapist now," Agatha's omega reacts instinctually, soothing pheromones covering the car in a blanket of softer smells, meant to pull the alpha back from the edge of her fury.</p><p>"Agatha..." Rio's scent responds, softening though the burn is still there. Agatha doesn't feel afraid, in fact she wants to step into the flames, confident she will not burn, wielding Rio's protective fire like a shield.</p><p>"What do you want to do?" Rio glances at Agatha and the omega sighs in relief and pride when she sees the color has returned to Rio's eyes.</p><p>"Have dinner and watch tv, I need to...process," Agatha sighs. She doesn't know what else she can do and that's precisely why she needs to think and plan her next steps carefully. </p><p>Rio doesn't leave when Agatha steps out of the car, killing the engine and following her into the house. </p><p>Agatha is mildly surprised, having thought the alpha would drop her off and return to work but Rio removes her jacket and brings her bag inside, seemingly done for the day.</p><p>Neither of them make any purposeful moves to the kitchen so Rio orders takeout from a Thai place, confirming delivery with Agatha in about twenty minutes.</p><p>Agatha moves to the couch, pulling the blanket from the leather chair while Rio changes her clothes and reappears with a beer for herself and a hard cider for Agatha who accepts it gratefully. </p><p>Rio answers the door when the food arrives and hesitates when she puts the paper bag on the coffee table, hovering near the couch unsure. Agatha gives the alpha a moment, recognizing the inner workings building toward a question.</p><p>"Do you want to be alone?" She asks.</p><p>The smell of kindling lingers and Agatha doesn't want Rio to be alone and angry any more than she wants to be so Agatha pulls back the blanket in invitation.</p><p>"No. Stay."</p><p>Rio shifts her weight and a new note enters the alpha's scent as she sits next to Agatha and opens everything, parsing out the paper boxes; a pad thai for Agatha and yellow curry for Rio and spring rolls to share. </p><p>Agatha picks something to watch, another reality dating show posted a new season so she hits play, claiming her share of the blanket and her food, poking around with her chopsticks to mix in the peanuts.</p><p>Rio takes alternating bites out of her rice and curry from separate containers, dipping a spring roll in her curry as an afterthought, humming happily in the way that tells Agatha the alpha had been hungry and probably didn't realize it.</p><p>They eat in silence while the hosts introduce the premise of the show where couples choose one another based on scent alone. If they both choose each other they couple up and get to go to Cancún with the other couples and the audience gets to watch the drama unfold.</p><p>The contestants come next and Agatha and Rio fall into familiar banter, judging which contestants they like, which ones are fake, and what their true jobs are behind their lower thirds. </p><p>"Tech sales means he works at a cell phone kiosk in the mall," Rio deadpans and Agatha lowers her drink quickly, snorting as she laughs. </p><p>The contestants go through the pairing process, taking notes on who they like and narrowing down their picks. Spliced in between are sound bites and solo confessionals, setting the stage for potential drama when two alphas find they've picked the same omega as their top choice.</p><p>"Does scent matter to you?" Agatha asks after she swallows a bite of noodles. </p><p>Rio tilts her head back for a few gulps of beer, Agatha's eyes watch the alpha's throat bob and the sudden lurch of her inner omega toward the alpha has Agatha looking down at her pad thai in mild panic.</p><p>"Um," Rio licks her lips and Agatha flushes. </p><p>"I think it's important but I think there's more to compatibility than just that. I think it's hard to not like someone's scent if you're attracted to them," Rio steals another spring roll.</p><p>Agatha reaches for her cider. </p><p>"Ralph smelled like expensive cigars and incense," Agatha admits quietly. He reminded her of a gentlemen's club; of old money and power and places she wanted to be where she wasn't allowed. Agatha wanted to wield that power and for a time she did, but it never really belonged to her if Ralph was so easily able to revoke it. </p><p>Agatha feels her rage building and squashes it, turning to Rio whose lip curls in a snarl at the mention of Ralph.</p><p>"What did your ex smell like?" Agatha asks, assuming if Rio nearly claimed her she must have smelled irresistable.</p><p>Agatha presses her shoulder against Rio's and the alpha relaxes, leaning into the touch. </p><p>"Leather and sage. Personality to match too."</p><p>Agatha tries to imagine the kind of person to match. Probably someone sultry and enigmatic, difficult to pin down, charming and bold... Agatha stops when her thoughts start to draw comparisons within herself.</p><p>They both finish eating and Agatha collects their trash to toss, returning with a fresh beer for Rio and another cider for herself. </p><p>"Do you know what you smelled like to your ex?" Agatha crawls under the blanket, leaning against Rio, enjoying the physical touch that satisfies both Agatha and her inner omega. Rio doesn't say anything but stretches her left arm over the back of the couch behind Agatha.</p><p>"A ficus." </p><p>Agatha turns to stare incredulously at the other woman.</p><p>"Sorry, that was her joke," Rio smirks and glances down. Agatha can see flecks of gold dotted over brown, captivating and inviting in their depth. "She said a botanical garden once."</p><p>"What do I smell like to you?" Agatha asks before she thinks.</p><p>She doesn't want to stop looking but it's Rio who drops her eyes first, coughing and shifting when her scent changes rapidly, masking something that grabs Agatha's attention.</p><p>"Uh, I don't know. It's smells good though."</p><p>"That's vague," Agatha raises an eyebrow, she's lost focus on the show. </p><p>"It's hard to describe," Rio has a glow in her cheeks that could be alcohol or embarrassment but it's endearing.</p><p>"I'm right here, you can smell me," Agatha points out and Rio's leg jumps up and down as she takes a long pull from her beer, picking at the paper label with her thumb when she rests the bottle on her knee.</p><p>"You smell...kind of sweet and a little citrus-y. It reminds me of my abuelita's plants," Rio starts, deciding to let her words flow freely.</p><p>"She had lemon and lime trees in pots that I had to drag into the garage every winter and this one shrub with white flowers that bloomed in the summer called mock orange that smelled so good, like orange blossoms and jasmine mixed together," Rio's eyes are decades in the past, shining with fond memories.</p><p>"When the wind blows you can smell it across the yard and it just draws you in like, it isn't heavy like perfume or you know how some flowers make your nose itch? This one doesn't, I could smell it all day and never get sick of it." </p><p>Agatha is stunned into silence along with her omega. She thought Rio would have the same succinct answer as before, but instead she's offered a glimpse into Rio's mind.</p><p>"My mom would wear the flowers in her hair and everytime I came home with my cousins after playing outside that's the first thing I could smell," Rio smiles.</p><p>"When we first left my dad I had nightmares for a few weeks and my mom would stay with me and I could smell it on her clothes. It smells like home, like being loved."</p><p>Rio seems to remember herself, eyes going wide for a second, the red in her cheeks spreading to her ears. </p><p>Agatha understands, her own ears are warm but she's flattered by the honesty, wondering if Rio just thought of all that or if she's been thinking about it for a while. </p><p>She thinks about Rio and the gala, the softness of her hair and the comfort of her smell, how safe she felt, still feels, in Rio's care. </p><p>She trusts her, Agatha decides.</p><p>It's frightening and exhilarating at the same time, her mistrust of alphas is deep and she can't learn the same painful lesson twice. Yet where she and her omega clash over desires, with Rio her whole being seems to fall into agreement, her omega content and silent in the alpha's presence.</p><p>"I wish I had a family like yours," Agatha whispers, needing a break from the tension.</p><p>Rio seems grateful for the subject change, blowing out a breath while Agatha glances away. </p><p>"What's yours like?" The alpha asks.</p><p>Agatha curls her lip, "It's just my mother. Never knew my father."</p><p>"No other relatives?" Rio asks with surprise.</p><p>"None that I know of."</p><p>"Is your mother still alive?" Rio ventures carefully.</p><p>"Unfortunately," Agatha replies curtly and Rio whistles.</p><p>"That bad, huh?"</p><p>"Worse," Agatha sighs. "Affection isn't quite her style. The number one rule is you don't embarrass Evanora Harkness," Agatha rolls her eyes and briefly tunes back in to the show where the contestants are well into their Mexican vacation.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I give her a lot to be embarrassed about," Agatha huffs and pulls the blanket up to her shoulders. </p><p>"She's going to be pissed about the divorce," Agatha groans.</p><p>"Good thing it's not her decision," Rio growls and Agatha's pulse jumps.</p><p>"Thank goodness for that."</p><p>They both let the show fill the silence though neither know what's going on or who is paired with who. Some how it doesn't feel important enough to address at the moment. </p><p>Rio finishes her beer and leans forward to put her empty bottle on the coffee table, Agatha bites back a grumble. She's comfortable. </p><p>"So...what smells like home to you then?" Rio asks, letting Agatha find her comfortable spot before settling herself back against the couch.</p><p>Agatha sighs and adjusts the blanket again to cover her legs and feet as she curls up. </p><p>"The woods," she says firmly. "There were woods in the back of our house. My mother didn't let me play with the other kids in the neighborhood. Whenever I wanted to play or get away from my mother I'd go there. I'd use leaves and twigs and dirt to make potions or pretend food and I'd take branches and try to make little houses and forts next to rocks. Thank goodness I didn't know how to start a fire..." Agatha laughs; she had been an imaginative child, living in her own world most of the time.</p><p>"Sounds like it was fun though," Rio's voice is warm.</p><p>"It was," Agatha nods.</p><p>"It was the last time I really felt like myself. After I presented, my mother insisted I be a 'high value' omega so I added classes and extracurriculars and community service... it was all very...presentational," Agatha grimaces.</p><p>"Not entirely presentational, I researched your career remember?"</p><p>"Might be the only thing I've done well," Agatha shrugs, leaning her head on Rio's shoulder; the alcohol, full belly, and Rio's scent make her sleepy, insulating her from the terrible things in her life that feel a thousand miles away.</p><p>"So far," Rio murmurs. "Once you're past this you'll be unstoppable."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio is warm.</p><p>The air in the room is cooler but Rio is comfortably warm. She snuggles deeper into her pillow, fighting wakefulness and inhaling deeply and sighing, rubbing her face against something soft and humming in contentment. </p><p>Rio hooks her leg up onto her comforter and hugs it closer to her body, a low hum rumbles in her chest when her cock brushes against another pillow. Her hips chase the feeling, rocking forward as Rio's sensory mind takes over, reaching for what feels good. </p><p>It's when her pillow gasps that Rio is violently shocked awake, her entire body freezing thanks to years of training as she assesses her environment.</p><p>She's on the couch. She and Agatha were watching television and talking late into the night. Agatha fell asleep first, tucked against Rio's side and snoring softly. Rio couldn't bring herself to move so she stayed, telling herself she'll wake a few hours later and they can go to bed.</p><p>Rio's face burns. Her pillow and blanket are nowhere to be found, instead she's wrapped around Agatha, her leg hooked over Agatha's hip and holding the omega with her back against Rio's front. </p><p>Rio's heart bangs against her ribs wildly and she's hyper aware of where her cock presses against Agatha's ass. </p><p>She does her best to tilt her hips back subtly, mind racing to figure out a way out of the compromising position. </p><p>Rio shifts and Agatha moves, startling Rio. Before she can move away and probably fall onto the floor, Agatha's hand covers Rio's. </p><p>The alpha internally panics, realizing Agatha is awake. </p><p>Agatha turns over her shoulder, moving slowly, like she's afraid to scare Rio away. Rio leans back to give Agatha some space, quickly pulling her leg back when Agatha turns over, apology spilling from her lips. </p><p>"Sorry, I-"</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha whispers, lifting a hand to tuck Rio's hair behind her ear. </p><p>The omega's eyes blink heavily, pupils wide and dark, darting down to Rio's lips and back up. Agatha's fingers splay against Rio's jaw and the alpha feels like she's going to vibrate out of her body. </p><p>Everything in Rio is attuned to Agatha's touch and the soft curves that gently conform to Rio's, slotting so perfectly together that Rio's alpha yearns for the omega, pointedly noting there is no lingering claim on her. </p><p>Agatha smoothes her thumb over Rio's cheek, leaning forward and brushing their noses together until Agatha is close enough Rio can feel her breathing. </p><p>Rio's alpha surges and bridges the distance, pressing her lips softly to Agatha's once, then again immediately after, needing another taste. </p><p>Agatha's lips part, pressing harder and cupping the alpha's face to draw her in, as Rio's tongue slips past Agatha's, caressing and pulling a quiet whimper from Agatha's throat. </p><p>Rio's hand drops to Agatha's waist and squeezes, pulling the omega flush against her as Rio's alpha roars to life, demanding she take the omega, feeling her cock twitch and harden against Agatha's thigh. </p><p>Rio's alpha snarls demanding that she do it now; she could easily climb atop the willing omega, she can smell her, citrus blossoms growing heady like overripe fruit waiting to be plucked. </p><p>She bites gently on Agatha's lower lip and the omega shudders in her arms. The alpha in Rio's head bares it's fangs screaming '<em>mine</em>' over and over, chanting it and zeroing in on the faded silvery mark, her teeth sharpening and preparing to bite.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha moans and lifts her hips, sparking a flash of heat that runs through Rio's body and her alpha roars so loudly in her mind that she's terrified. </p><p>Rio has always, <em>always</em>, been able to control her alpha. </p><p>Since she was old enough to understand what was happening with her mom and dad, Rio became determined that she would never let her alpha control her. As much as she loves her mother, Rio is an alpha, same as her father. The same darkness in him, lives in her, and she can't hurt an omega, not when she remembers the fear, the true terror, that wrecked her body seeing her father tower over her mother, finger on the trigger, one hair's breadth, one wrong move away from taking her mother away forever. </p><p>"Wait, wait, wait," Rio retreats, sitting up and pushing her hair away from her face. Her tank top is askew, lips swollen, and her cock sits heavy in her sweats. </p><p>"This isn't a good idea," she pants, wide eyes staring down at the omega who looks so beautifully ravished, her lips are pink and full and her rumpled shirt is lifted, exposing her middle and ribs that move quickly up and down, clearly just as affected as the alpha.</p><p>Agatha sits up on her elbows, staring at the alpha in confusion, head tilted and eyes narrowing as she waits expectantly for an explanation. </p><p>Rio scrambles for one, running her fingers through her hair and gripping the back of her neck. She sits back on her haunches and tries to ignore the obvious discomfort between her legs. </p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio feels like she's been apologizing a lot to Agatha lately, taking all the wrong steps and having to be the bearer of bad news. She can't help but feel like, combined with the overwhelming reaction of her alpha, Rio might actually be bad for Agatha.</p><p>"You're vulnerable right now, there's a lot going on, you just learned about something upsetting and you have to focus on your divorce and..." Rio sighs, playing an internal game of tug of war with her alpha who is <em>pissed</em>.</p><p>"It's just not a good idea," Rio drops her eyes. It's as much for Agatha as it is for herself, Rio reasons.</p><p>Agatha slowly pushes herself up to sit, drawing herself to the opposite side of the couch. </p><p>"What's the real reason?" Agatha growls, her eyes harden to grey steel, shuttering her defenses over the vulnerable parts of her like armor manifesting as Rio watches her transform, no longer soft and yielding but sharp an deadly.</p><p>"I just told-"</p><p>"Don't do that." Agatha cuts Rio off, fixing her shirt and pushing her hair back over her shoulders like she's brushing off the last few minutes, pushing away the last remnants of desire.</p><p>Rio is bewildered, widening her eyes in confusion. </p><p>"What am I doing?"</p><p>"Telling me how I feel," Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio doesn't understand so Agatha keeps talking.</p><p>"You don't think I know everything in my life is shit right now?" Agatha spits the truth like acid. </p><p>"I know what I'm dealing with because the whole point is that <em>I</em> am the one dealing with it. I get to decide if what I feel is too much for me."</p><p>Every time Agatha says 'I' she feels selfish though she means what she says. Rio has taken care of her, seen her at her lowest, and all she can think of is taking more from the alpha? </p><p>Still, she is sensitive to any form of control no matter the intention. Agatha almost lost everything, including herself, so she reaches for any bit of power she can, and that extends her emotions. </p><p>She knows herself. If Agatha has learned anything it's that she's tired of others deciding her life for her.</p><p>"I didn't mean it that way," Rio defends. She feels defeated but she knows for Agatha's own good, she needs to say no.</p><p>"Then what did you mean?" Agatha gives her a chance to explain.</p><p>"I don't... I don't want to overwhelm you," Rio thinks of how ferociously her alpha responded. </p><p>"I'm just worried about you, I don't think it's a good idea to add another... thing to everything else you have to deal with."</p><p>Agatha doesn't give anything away, her face a blank mask that Rio struggles to read.</p><p>"In other words, you're trying to do what's best for me?"</p><p>Agatha echoes Rio's thoughts and the alpha nods, "Yeah, kind of."</p><p>"And you think you know what's best for me?" </p><p>Agatha's voice is too calm and Rio feels like she's walking into a trap. She suddenly understands Agatha's litigation record, the omega always a few steps ahead.</p><p>"No, of course not," Rio replies automatically.</p><p>"So which is it?" Agatha tilts her head, "Am I incapable or empowered?"</p><p>The only thing that gives away the emotion leashed beneath the omega's calm surface is the way her eyes shine and Rio suddenly feels like an ass when she has no good answer.</p><p>"I..." Rio's mouth moves but nothing comes out. It's all the confirmation Agatha needs. </p><p>"That's what I thought," Agatha stands, her scent turning bitter as she retreats toward her room. She stops and places her hand on the wall that separates the living area from the bedrooms. </p><p>"If you don't want me, come up with a better reason than, 'it's for your own good'," Agatha sounds like the strength has been sapped from her voice, more disappointed than anything.</p><p>She turns to look over her shoulder, gaze drawn magnetically to Rio's from across the room. </p><p>"And make sure you can say it to my face."</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is not good with rejection.</p><p>Technically she's been rejected twice now, if she counts her heat.</p><p>Granted, most people don't do well with rejection but when it's on a personal level like this Agatha needs to retreat to recover from the devastation and lick her wounds.</p><p>She can't help but ruminate, playing back every interaction with Rio she can remember, every accidental touch, the attention, the late night talks, everything points to Rio wanting her.</p><p>Agatha runs her hand through her hair, the phantom touches of Rio's fingers still linger on her skin, the heat of Rio pressing against her, grinding and rocking, her body responding before she has a chance to wake, recognizing the familiar smell of safety and home. </p><p>If she touches herself now, Agatha knows she'll be slick, her omega needy and forlorn, like she's been ousted from a pack, alone and unwanted.</p><p>
<em>If you leave me who will want you?</em>
</p><p>Agatha hates that she cares.</p><p>Rio had given her an excuse. Agatha knows the alpha well enough now to figure out when she's panicking and the look Rio had given her was pure fear, like she touched something forbidden.</p><p>Something dirty.</p><p>Maybe this is her penance for being stupid enough to fall for Ralph, destined to carry his stain if not his scent for the rest of her life like a perpetual scarlet 'A' sewn against her chest.</p><p>Agatha touches the healed mark, no more than silver dashes on her skin, no longer deep and prominent but still there if someone looks hard enough. Nothing happens when her fingers brush the skin; the pull toward Ralph is gone, her body is hers again. </p><p>
<em>I don't want to overwhelm you. </em>
</p><p>Agatha huffs; as if Rio hasn't been overwhelming since the beginning; demanding Agatha's attention and studying her in turn. </p><p>Honestly, the alpha remembered her coffee order after the first time, who does that? Rio notices and remembers... everything. </p><p>Agatha's favorite dessert appears in the fridge every so often. The fuzzy blanket she prefers sits on the couch after being stolen from Rio's leather chair multiple times. A couple of Agatha's scrunchies sit around the gear shift in Rio's car because Agatha frequently forgets a hair tie when she leaves the house. Rio even mentioned a new dating show they could watch together, having seen an ad for it and thinking Agatha would be interested. </p><p>So many small moments like tiles in a mosaic coming together.</p><p>What she knows about Rio, what she is certain about, is that Rio will tell her the truth, even if it's upsetting. From their first conversation at the cafe, to the interrogation room, Rio might have reasons for waiting, but she's always told Agatha the truth.</p><p>So what makes this different?</p><p>Agatha's stomach swoops, her mind already drawing to conclusions that all lead to heartbreak. </p><p>She wipes a stray tear that escapes her eye. Maybe she <em>should</em> focus on what lies directly ahead of her. There's no way of telling what Ralph's reaction will be to the divorce and she should probably find a place of her own. </p><p>The omega in Agatha pouts, not liking the idea of distance from Rio but she reminds her omega that if Rio doesn't want them, there's nothing they can do. </p><p>She can't force Rio to be with her. </p><p>Agatha's thoughts start crawling toward the dark place in her mind, a shadowed corner that branches out with dark roots, prodding and looking for weakness to infect the rest of her thoughts. </p><p>
<em>Please...stop</em>
</p><p>Her breathing grows labored and Agatha struggles to get a full lungful of air, shaking her head as if she can physically derail her train of thought before it reaches the dark tunnel. </p><p>She turns her thoughts back to Rio.</p><p>The only reason she can think of for Rio to swerve around the truth is if what she has to say will hurt Agatha. The alpha might say it's for Agatha's own good but only because the truth behind it is she thinks Agatha can't handle it. That she's a fragile broken mess.</p><p>Rio might want her physically and might not subscribe to traditional roles but, outside of that, Agatha begrudgingly admits she's a lot. </p><p>Her personality is off-putting, her honesty is cutting, she's emotional, and that doesn't even consider she's a homeless, possibly jobless, soon to be divorcee, a lab rat, and a tainted omega. </p><p>Agatha wouldn't want her either. </p><p>But she deserves to be told to her face.</p><p>Pulling her laptop from the charger, Agatha sits up in bed, sending a series of emails to her divorce attorney, to Lilia, and to a few realtors to start collecting listings for apartments.</p><p>While she scrolls through listings in her area, Agatha thinks about how much work she needs to do to recollect her power. </p><p>She frowns.</p><p>What karmic debt could she owe that since birth she's had to pay penance? And just when she thought she was free, Agatha had been lulled into false comfort, letting her guard down just enough to allow the universe to take another pound of flesh. </p><p>Ralph could have chased anyone else. There's no shortage of submissive omegas, fully devoted to the idea of serving an alpha. He could have had any one of them. </p><p>Agatha doesn't come from prominence, she serves no social advantage for Ralph and has actually seemingly been more trouble to him than anything. </p><p>So why her?</p><p>The question continues to bother Agatha among other things late into the night, falling asleep with her laptop open on the bed beside her, multiple tabs open and ready like a digital vision board to inspire Agatha toward a new future.</p><p>One that includes no alpha.</p><p>-------------</p><p>For Rio, nothing changes, yet everything does. </p><p>When the omega eventually emerges from her room a day later, she acts like nothing happened and Rio has no idea what that means so she does what she always does when she's unsure in a social situation; she follows the other person's lead.</p><p>Their routine remains mostly uninterrupted though Agatha does get busier, taking calls and emailing back and forth with her boss. After meeting with Lilia and explaining her situation, and essentially begging for her job back, Agatha jumps into remote work for now until she's back on her suppressants.</p><p>Agatha sends the petition for divorce and unmating to Ralph's lawyers, along with intent to press charges for the non-consensual drugging, deciding between herself and her lawyer that having charges filed will go a long way toward smoothing the road to divorce. </p><p>Agatha doesn't avoid Rio; the alpha often comes home to Agatha set up at the dining room table like a war room, glasses perched on her nose and biting her thumbnail as she scrolls and focuses on her screen. She still smiles in greeting though it's a bit more strained than it used to be. </p><p>They don't get to watch as much of Agatha's shows any more, her work pulling the omega away as she catches up on weeks of cases and consults. They still take turns cooking but often don't eat together any more as Agatha takes calls with her attorney or Jen, making plans for the future that don't include Rio.</p><p>Rio feels like she doesn't get to be anything other than supportive of the steps Agatha is taking to rebuild her life. It's what she wanted isn't it? </p><p>Agatha's confidence is slowly blooming, she laughs more, the corners of her eyes crinkling with mirth when she talks to Jen. The strength and steel return to her eyes, though every time they turn on Rio the alpha can see the disappointment reflecting back in sky blue.</p><p>Rio knows she should talk to her, try to explain, but Agatha won't accept her initial explanation, forcing Rio to reevaluate and regroup, trying to see what Agatha sees. </p><p>It's tough when her alpha paces in the back of her mind, watching the omega pull away and growing more upset every day Rio does nothing about it. </p><p>She argues with her internal predator. The alpha has enjoyed how dependant Agatha has been, likes taking care of her, protecting her, and demands Rio continue doing so but Rio's logical mind argues that Agatha wants her independence, she can't <em>own</em> the omega, no matter how possessive her alpha feels.</p><p>Rio fears losing control of her alpha and the closer she gets to Agatha, the less she's able to reign in her baser instinct and the last thing she wants to do is scare Agatha into fleeing.</p><p>And she knows Agatha would run. </p><p>The omega has run before; any time Agatha has gotten overwhelmed she runs.</p><p>
<em>It's only a profile if it's a pattern. </em>
</p><p>If Rio tells Agatha her self-control is crumbling, she won't be able to handle watching the warmth evaporate from Agatha's eyes only to be replaced by guarded suspicion. </p><p>As much as Agatha's disappointment stings like a wound, seeing Agatha afraid of <em>her</em> would be the killing blow. </p><p>To Rio she has two options. The first is to tell Agatha the truth about why she worries and watch her realize Rio is just like the rest of her designation, or she can let the omega out grow Rio, like a new shoot springing up from a mother plant, borrowing energy and life until it's able to live alone, filling out it's own pot and growing steadily.  </p><p>Rio knows which one she prefers.</p><p>So Rio does nothing. She lets Agatha grow and convinces herself she can swallow her feelings. </p><p>They're careful not to touch, orbiting around each other respectfully like true roommates though to Rio, having felt Agatha's body yielding against her, it's torture in the highest degree, stomach cramping uncomfortably when Agatha passes close enough her scent lingers in the air. </p><p>Rio endures it, telling herself she'll miss it when she's gone. </p><p>Rio gets some time off after working the VersaRX case. It's supposed to be recuperation time but Rio finds herself on her computer at home, tying up loose ends and answering questions for the prosecutors and lead investigators reviewing the case over state lines.</p><p>There's a tension that starts to build in the omega over the next week which Rio only notices because she's home. Agatha seems jumpy and preoccupied; Rio scares her one night when she asks about groceries resulting in the omega slamming her laptop shut quickly which surprises Rio but she brushes it off. </p><p>Agatha takes frequent trips into town, ordering an Uber when she needs to, but the difference is where before Rio felt comfortable asking Agatha about her day when she returns, Rio isn't sure now if she still retains that privilege, holding in her questions under the pretense of minding her own business.</p><p>Near the end of the week, Rio's nose tips her off that something is different. </p><p>Agatha comes home mid-day from an appointment, greeting Rio with a tight nod as she makes a beeline for her room which doesn't bother Rio but the scent that follows after the omega is acrid like cleaning chemicals, a far cry from her usual fragrant blossom and nothing like the high lemon of her fear. </p><p>It's new and it's not good. </p><p>When Agatha emerges again a couple hours later, she rummages around the kitchen to make herself a late lunch. </p><p>"Everything good?" Rio keeps her tone light and friendly, looking up from where she watches TV on her leather chair, laptop sitting on her legs as she works. </p><p>Agatha sits on the couch, tucking her legs under her and stabbing at her salad.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha replies distractedly, mixing the dressing around.</p><p>"I have a meeting tomorrow morning. Not sure how long it'll be so I don't know when I'll be back."</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow when Agatha's scent spikes again. Whatever this meeting is, it's making Agatha upset and anxious, Rio realizing that's what the 'lemon floor cleaner' smell is as it intensifies until the place smells like Fabuloso, which normally would be great, if it weren't coming from a stiff and jittery omega.</p><p>"Damn, work isn't giving you any breaks are they?" Rio prods as gently as she can, very aware that Agatha is on a short fuse that can be sparked by the slightest misstep.</p><p>"It's a personal meeting," Agatha replies tersely.</p><p>"Oh," Rio's concern sky rockets, wondering what kind of personal meeting could elicit that response, her mind going to Ralph immediately but Rio can't fathom a reason for Agatha to see him; especially after what the FBI has uncovered about the development and supply of drugs being funneled toward a trafficking ring and her own drugging.</p><p>Turns out, a few other mates had been subjected to the same trial. Agatha had reached out to them; planting the seeds for a lawsuit against the company if not their mates directly.</p><p>"Well... if you get home before lunch I was thinking about ordering tacos. Let me know if you want some," Rio finishes lamely. </p><p>She knows it's going to bug her for the rest of the night. Rio's alpha grows prickly with concern, triggering protective instincts, but she reminds herself that Agatha doesn't want Rio in her business. </p><p>"Thanks," Agatha replies with a tight smile.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The next morning, Rio is up early.</p><p>She's already made a pot of coffee and waits for Agatha. She knows the omega is awake, Rio can hear her moving around in her room and bathroom. </p><p>The odd scent is still there and still as pungent as it was the night before and possibly more acrid. There's a nagging from Rio's intuition and her alpha that something bad is coming and it makes her anxious with anticipation.</p><p>When Agatha appears, Rio notices her make up is done, her hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, and the dark umber blouse she wears wraps over her waist loosely under her dark coat. She looks beautiful, Rio notes with bittersweet admiration. </p><p>It's too bad Agatha looks like she's marching to her death. </p><p>Agatha's mouth sits in a grim line as she fastens an earring and looks for her phone and bag, making no move for the coffee pot which only makes Rio more suspicious when Agatha deviates from her routine. </p><p>"Want any coffee before you head out?" Rio asks, the note of concern not quite as well hidden as she'd like. </p><p>Agatha shakes her head without so much as a glance at Rio, "No, I'll grab some later."</p><p>Rio frowns, "Alright, let me know about lunch."</p><p>"I will. See you later."</p><p>"Bye."</p><p>Rio watches Agatha leave, distracted and bitter-smelling and threads her fingers together, resting her elbows on the dining room table and tapping her clasped hands against her forehead.</p><p>Rio stares at the door.</p><p>She shouldn't, Rio argues with her alpha while the alpha argues back that Rio knows something is clearly wrong, she needs to protect the omega. </p><p>The alpha reasons that Rio doesn't need to step in, she doesn't even need to know what the meeting is about, but she can't let Agatha go without making sure she's safe. </p><p>Rio doesn't want to presume to know what is best for Agatha, not after <em>that</em> morning, but Rio's alpha argues this wouldn't be for Agatha's good, it's to alleviate the unease that nags at Rio and the part of the alpha that's unable to stop obsessing over the omega.</p><p>The alpha stands and grabs her jacket and her keys. </p><p>Agatha won't even have to know she's there. If it's nothing then Rio can slink home and berate her alpha for worrying over nothing. </p><p>It's simple surveillance, like a routine case she's done a thousand times before.</p><p>While the engine turns over in her car, Rio thinks about the implications, about sneaking around to spy on Agatha, how pissed the omega would be if she knew what Rio is about to do, how she might never be able to tell the omega; keeping her movements a secret; a well-intentioned betrayal.</p><p>The guilt almost makes Rio turn around, but when she follows Agatha's Uber toward a different suburb and a park with campsites, her curiosity is peaked, pulling into the far side of the parking lot while Agatha makes her way down one of the trails. </p><p>The alpha in Rio urges her from the car, following downwind from the omega and tracking her by scent. </p><p>The park itself is well kept, if empty. There's a large playground and community center that hints at the family-oriented nature of the area which might explain the lack of people in the middle of the day. </p><p>Rio imagines that in the afternoon and evenings there are kids and families wandering the area, spending time outside together to burn off extra energy before bed. </p><p>Rio wonders if these are the same woods Agatha played in as a child. </p><p>The trail splits off, Rio going left which leads toward the campsites, lending themselves toward more privacy with the natural shrubbery and trees providing separation and concealment from the main trail.</p><p>Rio slows when she hears movement and Agatha's smell grows stronger, mixing with the woods around her along with a second scent that makes Rio wrinkle her nose. It's stale and decaying; not human decay, but like an abandoned house left to rot in the forest; mildew, mold, and wet wood.</p><p>She can hear a voice; it's not Agatha's but it's definitely feminine and shrill. Rio moves closer.</p><p>"-worried about you? You've thrown tantrums before but this is a whole other level."</p><p>Rio steps off the trail before the path opens up to a small seating area, finding a spot behind some trees that gives her some cover.</p><p>"Nice to see you too, Mother."</p><p>Rio's ears perk. Her mother. No wonder Agatha had been so on edge. She remembers the way Agatha talked about her mother with barely concealed venom as she described the narcissistic woman. </p><p>Rio can only assume Agatha is finally telling her about the divorce or she already knows. It would make sense then, the secluded meeting spot. </p><p>Evanora wouldn't want to be embarrassed. </p><p>"Cut the crap, Agatha, and explain yourself," Evanora hisses and Rio's heart breaks for the omega. </p><p>"I left Ralph."</p><p>"Well that I know," The older woman scoffs.</p><p>"The poor man has been in shambles and now he's the victim of a witch hunt, the last thing he needs is whatever crisis you're going through on top of that."</p><p>Rio can't help it, she needs to look, not believing the things her ears are hearing. She needs to see this woman, this <em>mother</em>, who would talk to her daughter in such a way.</p><p>The two women continue to talk as Rio gradually shifts her weight to peek around the tree, spotting white and grey hair twisted up in a severe bun and a black sweater. </p><p>Part of the woman's face is blocked by Agatha whose back is toward Rio, but she can see dark eyes ringed with bruise-colored bags under them and a scowl so deep the lines in her face are made permanent. </p><p>"Mother, he put his hands on me!"</p><p>"Then you <em>talk</em> to him, you don't run away like a child!"</p><p>"You think <em>talking</em> to him is the solution? Are you kidding right now?"</p><p>The alpha understands Agatha's distain for her mother in just a few sentences, shoving down the growl that builds in her throat. Did this woman not hear her daughter? Ralph hurt her child, how can she stand there and tell Agatha to talk to him? </p><p>"No, absolutely not, that's why I took it upon myself to help you fix this."</p><p>"What are you talking about? What did you do?"</p><p>There's a hint of panic in Agatha's voice and Rio clenches her fingers into fists, refusing to reveal herself and undermine the omega. She has to trust that Agatha can take care of herself.</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>Shit. Rio recognizes the smell of cigarettes and her hackles rise, feeling her alpha tense and bare it's fangs as Ralph's voice grates against her ears. </p><p>Rio isn't sure who to be more angry with, Evanora for putting her daughter in danger or Ralph himself for having the gall to surprise Agatha with his presence. </p><p>"No," Agatha snaps, "I don't want to talk to you..."</p><p>The heat rises in Rio's neck, adrenaline entering her veins, making her heart pump rapidly as her muscles tense and ready to fight. </p><p>Evanora scoffs, "Agatha stop this!"</p><p>"I have nothing to say to you," Agatha ignores her mother and steps back, putting more space between her and Ralph, inadvertently stepping closer to Rio who can smell the fury coming off of Agatha in waves. </p><p>"Agatha please, let me explain," Ralph pleads, his hands held out in front of him, palms up in supplication, the perfect picture of remorse and humility. </p><p>Stress hasn't been good for him. His face is sallow and a little grey and his hair is longer and shaggier around his ears, making him look unkempt. If Rio didn't know better she might even feel bad for him.</p><p>Agatha must be about to respond because Evanora digs her fingers into Agatha's arm, bony claws like a hawk clamping down on it's prey. Rio winces in sympathy. </p><p>"Shut your mouth, girl, and listen for once!"</p><p>Agatha freezes and Ralph steps forward; the hairs on the back of Rio's neck rise. </p><p>"Agatha please, I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt you, you've seen what they're doing to me, I need you. I need you to drop the charges, I promise I would never hurt you like that."</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p>"Just in other ways," Agatha deadpans.</p><p>Ralph shakes his head, "No, no I promise no more, I'm working on my temper, I'm not hiding anything. I'll even let you go through my phone if you want. I'll do anything you want to prove to you how sorry I am."</p><p>"You're lying."</p><p>Rio is proud of Agatha. Her voice is strong and she stands tall, refusing to pander to Ralph's pathetic performance. Agatha had said repeatedly she couldn't go back and she never wavered, doing everything she could to separate herself from Ralph once she decided to leave. </p><p>She's come so far.</p><p>The alpha feels the admiration fill her chest. Ralph has no idea what he's lost. Agatha isn't an omega to be tamed and broken, her beauty lives in her freedom, her ferocity a sight to behold. </p><p>Taming Agatha is like trying to enslave a goddess; an impossible task. You earn her loyalty through worship and devotion; and Rio would happily sacrifice herself on the altar.</p><p>"I'm not lying, Agatha! I've been destroyed without you!" Ralph's voice rises and snaps Rio's attention back to the tableau before her, Evanora still grasping Agatha's arm, keeping her stuck in place and forced to listen to Ralph's appeal.</p><p>"What about the drugs?" Agatha asks bluntly. </p><p>"Agatha!" Evanora shakes Agatha's arm to chastise her.</p><p>This explanation should be good, Rio muses.</p><p>"It's not true. They're lying to you to pin this whole thing on me. They're poisoning you so you turn against me and it's <em>working</em>," Ralph shakes his head like he's disappointed in her and Rio snorts quietly. </p><p>"Sweetheart, you're smarter than this."</p><p>Patronizing asshole.</p><p>"You're right, I am," Agatha doesn't give an inch.</p><p>"Agatha, why are you being so cold?" Evanora inserts herself again and Rio thinks it's unfair that Agatha's being ambushed, wishing she could be by the omega's side instead of hiding, if only to keep Evanora quiet. </p><p>"Your mate is literally begging! You have a duty-"</p><p>"<em>Don't</em>," Agatha snaps, yanking her arm from Evanora's hold, "Just don't, Mother."</p><p>Ralph sighs wearily, "Agatha, please, I didn't come here to fight."</p><p>"Then you shouldn't have come at all," Agatha sneers.</p><p>"I came because I love you, I want to fix this," Ralph's voice softens like he's talking to a child, switching his tactic to try and sway Agatha.</p><p>"Are you okay? Have you been sick?"</p><p>Rio could spit, she's so angry. He knows she would have been sick being away from him, Rio doubts he actually cares but if course he would ask, assuming she's been torn apart without him.</p><p>"That's none of your business."</p><p>"You <em>are</em> my business," Ralph snarls.</p><p>She can hear the frustration building every time Agatha stone walls him and Rio goes on high alert.</p><p>"Not anymore."</p><p>"Agatha come on, don't be like this," Rio can hear the whine in Ralph's voice and her skin prickles with irritation. </p><p>"If I didnt care about you I would have filed a police report for the stuff you took and money you stole from our account," Ralph grumbles, demonstrating his supposed benevolence. </p><p>"Do you know how broken I was when you left? I thought something terrible happened to you and then to get arrested and come home to find all your things gone? I almost didn't survive it." </p><p>Almost? Pity, Rio thinks.</p><p>"So why didn't you?" Agatha asks, genuinely curious. </p><p>"Why didn't I what?"</p><p>"File a report."</p><p>"Because I wanted to talk to you, Agatha!" Ralph is nearly shouting and Rio lurches in place before she catches herself.</p><p>"This is our marriage on the line, I wasn't ready to give up on you!"</p><p>Agatha takes another step back and Ralph takes another forward, like a twisted version of a waltz with an unwilling partner.</p><p>"What about the family we had planned? Don't you feel anything? All these years together and you want to end it like this?"</p><p>Of course Ralph would make their divorce Agatha's fault.</p><p>"You should have thought about that before you put your hands on me."</p><p>"I told you I'm sorry, it'll never happen again, I promise."</p><p>Liar, Rio sneers.</p><p>"And what about the next time I say no?"</p><p>Rio freezes and her eyes go wide. Her heart seizes in her chest the same time a sharp pain stabs her in the gut. Rio's vision goes blurry and she blinks rapidly, feeling like she could burst out of her skin and become a monster at any moment, because what does she <em>mean the next time she says no?</em></p><p>"No to what?" He asks dumbly.</p><p>"You know exactly what," Agatha's voice trembles and Rio's alpha wants to howl in pain.</p><p>"I really don't."</p><p>Agatha swallows, "You... <em>raped</em> me, Ralph."</p><p>Rio's fingernails cut into her palms and the coppery taste of blood hits her tongue when she bites down on her lip and shuts her eyes. Her alpha bays for blood, choking itself on the leash of Rio's self control, ready to strangle itself in a rabid attempt to sink her claws into Ralph's neck.</p><p>The argument continues quickly while Rio fights an internal war. </p><p>"What?! Agatha, you can't just throw that word around-" Ralph steps forward again but Agatha holds her ground, daring him to silence her.</p><p>"That's what you did!" She shouts back.</p><p>"Shhhh! Lower your voice!" Evanora cuts in, eyes cutting and appalled.</p><p>"That's what you care about?!" Agatha stares at her mother in disbelief while Ralph takes the moment to cut in, holding out his hand to reach for Agatha like a cornered animal.</p><p>"Agatha mated couples sleep together all the time, pheromones are stronger in alphas, you have to understand it's a natural response, especially for an alpha with a mate," Ralph tries to smooth over Agatha's outrage but the excuse makes Rio want to tear her hair out.</p><p>It's not natural to hurt your mate; the bearer of your future children.</p><p>With her history and as obsessed with research as Rio is, she's read everything she can about the history and hierarchy of her designation, the scientific and so called 'natural' reasons for the aggression and possessiveness of alphas. </p><p>The 'natural' inclination is to pick the strongest and most compatible mate to produce the best offspring.</p><p>Agatha falls perfectly into that category. </p><p>But once chosen, the alpha's role becomes provision and protection, maintaining their omega's strength and integrity in the interest of passing along their genetics. </p><p>It's only in recent human history that the idea of subservience took hold and with that, harsh punishment for non-conformity, cutting down the mates they still expect to bear healthy and resilient children. </p><p>"You're wrong," Agatha's voice shakes. She's nearing the end of her patience and tolerance.</p><p>Ralph seems to sense it as well, mask slipping a fraction when his face twists in a menacing glower, "And you know better?"</p><p>"I know there are better alphas than you."</p><p>Rio nears the end of her tether, she doesn't like the way Ralph sounds or smells. Agatha shakes her head and exhales sharply through her nose, pushing him out of her senses when he tries to push his pheromones on her.</p><p>When Rio smells the fear coming from Agatha her feet move before she can think. The leash on her alpha snaps and Rio abandons her hiding spot, vision red and zeroing in on the other alpha advancing on Agatha.  </p><p>"Agatha please, enough, it's time to come home," Ralph says firmly. Rio can read the intent in his ratty face and surges forward just as Ralph grabs Agatha's wrist.</p><p>"Don't fucking touch me!" Agatha pulls her arm back instinctively.</p><p>Rio is a dark blur as she lowers her shoulder and wraps her arms around Ralph's waist, taking him to the ground and scrambling quickly to pin him face down, using her shins to hold down an arm and his hips, grabbing his other arm and bending it backward threateningly.  </p><p>"Ralph!" Evanora screams. </p><p>Rio has no time to look back, the only thing that echoes in her mind is the roar of her alpha, teeth gnashing and foaming at the mouth, face twisting into a dark snarl, lips curling back, eyes black and unfeeling, claws digging in to Ralph's arm and salivating at the thought of snapping his shoulder from its socket. </p><p>Her voice shudders with otherworldly rage, threatening and powerful, her alpha pushing forward to speak, using Rio as a vessel to deliver an unmistakably clear message.</p><p>"If you <em>ever</em> lay a hand on her again, I'll bury you so far down you'll have to look up to find the devil," Rio snarls, pulling his arm back enough to ache.</p><p>"Agatha call the police!" Evanora shrieks, and Rio snaps at her.</p><p>"I <em>am</em> the police!"</p><p>The authority of Rio's alpha rings loud enough to cow the older omega into silence, head bowing in deference.</p><p>"Get the fuck off me!" Ralph thrashes and Rio strengthens her hold, grinning maniacally, her alpha thrilled to let its aggression over power the other alpha, gleefully confirming what she's known all along; Ralph is unworthy, pathetic and easily subdued, no match for Rio's rage.</p><p>"Oh I don't think you understand," Rio sing-songs, leaning down so Ralph can see her toothy grin in his peripheral. </p><p>"You see, some alphas are simply more aggressive, they have stronger pheromones than others," Rio grits her teeth, hissing his words back at him. </p><p>"It's a natural response to a threat."</p><p>"It's you," Ralph's eye widens in recognition. </p><p>"Why the fuck are you here?" Ralph lifts his head as much as he can, shouting back toward Agatha furiously.</p><p>"Is this why you left?" He thunders, thrashing again, not to escape, but like he wants to get to Agatha and throttle her.</p><p>"Did you help them fuck me over for some fucking affair with a dyke cop?!"</p><p>Rio twists Ralph's thumb backward until he cries out.</p><p>"No, Ralphie boy," Rio purrs. "Aren't you listening? That's all on you."</p><p>Ralph's face is red with exertion as he pants and redirects his attention to Rio. </p><p>"The minute you let go I'm gonna call your superiors. Hope you enjoyed your last day on the job."</p><p>Rio laughs.</p><p>"You sure about that? I seem to recall you assaulting your soon-to-be ex-wife."</p><p>"You have no idea who I know," Ralph spits and Rio shakes her head. Predictable.</p><p>"I don't. But while you make your phone calls, I'll make mine. You still have your personal computer don't you? It'd be a shame if we found probable cause to search it."</p><p>Rio's voice is dangerously saccharine, a false front for a very real threat.</p><p>"What else are you hiding, Ralphie? Maybe some folders with questionable photos? Some stocks you need to get rid of in a hurry?" </p><p>Ralph stops squirming for a moment, eye wide as Rio's threat sinks through his thick skull. There's a good chance Rio is right, after all, men like Ralph are never guilty of just one thing. </p><p>"Cause I promise you, I'll find it. And when I do, you'll wish you never heard of me."</p><p>Ralph swallows, "You have no warrant-" </p><p>"Not yet," Rio grins. </p><p>Behind her, Rio hears the familiar sound of a pistol slide, clicking as the chamber is primed. </p><p>Slowly, Rio turns her head, spotting Agatha for the first time, holding a grey and black pistol, aimed at Ralph.</p><p>Rio's eyes go wide, torn between trying to talk Agatha down and keeping her mouth shut so she doesn't make Agatha look unstable in front of the two people most likely to use it against her.</p><p>She prays Agatha doesn't shoot. </p><p>"Leave," she orders, directing the order toward Evanora.</p><p>Evanora looks at her daughter in horror, stepping away from her quickly. </p><p>"Agatha! What are you-"</p><p>"Stop," Agatha cuts her eyes toward Evanora, the pain of betrayal evident when her eyes well with tears. "If you ever want to speak to me again you'll stop talking and leave."</p><p>Evanora presses her lips together tightly though her eyes speak volumes as they try to burn through Agatha. She turns and quickly hurries back down the trail, not bothering to look back.</p><p>Agatha watches her go until Evanora rounds a bend, disappearing from view. </p><p>When she's gone, Agatha slowly approaches, stone faced with her hand clutching her pistol. The only acknowledgement she gives Rio is a flick of her chin and the alpha releases Ralph, letting him stumble and huff angrily as he rights himself to face the two women, brushing the dirt off his face and clothes.</p><p>Agatha stares at Ralph with disgust, her brow heavy as she glares, the corners of her mouth turning down and shaking her head slowly. </p><p>"Why? Just why? You could have had any other omega who would have done everything you wanted. Why me?"</p><p>Ralph holds up his hands, afraid and pleading, looking at Agatha like she's unhinged.</p><p>"Because I love you. I want <em>you</em>."</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes briefly and curls her lip. </p><p>"I never want to see you outside of a courtroom ever again," Agatha exhales wearily, shoulders dropping with finality. </p><p>Ralph hesitates for a moment, looking like he has more to say, glancing from Agatha to Rio and back again. </p><p>"Leave," Agatha repeats when Ralph opens his mouth.</p><p>She narrows her eyes, her finger inching toward the trigger, daring Ralph to do something stupid. </p><p>He gets the hint and stalks off in the opposite direction, neither woman moving as they watch him go, tracking him as far as they can until he disappears from view. </p><p>As soon as Rio feels safe, she whips around to face Agatha who is bent over, hands on her knees and shaking, pistol still clutched in her hand.</p><p>"Agatha..." Rio speaks softly and holds her hand out. </p><p>"Agatha give me the gun," she murmurs nervously. There's no way Agatha would have gotten a license to carry this quickly, never mind where she actually got the weapon in the first place. She needs to take it, her professional training demands she do so. </p><p>Agatha pulls back the slide, exposing the barrel and handing the weapon to Rio sideways. The alpha raises an eyebrow, since when did Agatha know how to handle a firearm?</p><p>Rio takes the weapon and looks down at the empty chamber in surprise. She pops the magazine and it's light. </p><p>No bullets. </p><p>Rio exhales. Jesus fucking christ, this woman.</p><p>Rio barks a laugh and then another until she's cackling and tearing up, wiping the corner of her eye and looking at Agatha who gives Rio a nervous smile.</p><p>"Thank your Aunt Sophia for the inspiration."</p><p>Rio laughs again and reassembles the weapon, tucking it into her jacket for now.</p><p>"Want a ride home?" She asks.</p><p>Agatha nods and Rio leads the way, walking next to Agatha and keeping an eye out for any sign that Ralph or Evanora might have stuck around.</p><p>It's only when they're both buckled in and on the road that Rio relaxes, nervous energy dissipating and replaced by a different kind of anticipation. </p><p>They need to talk; she wants to make sure Agatha is okay and more than that, Rio wants to apologize, expecting that Agatha will be livid once she collects her thoughts. Before Agatha gets too angry, Rio needs to tell her the truth.</p><p>Right now, Agatha's scent is all over the place as she cycles through emotions and Rio can't imagine what she smells like to the omega when her alpha is still coming down from its frenzy, pacing back and forth with conflicting desires; both wanting to destroy the inferior alpha and curl up around the omega like an over protective guard dog.</p><p>Rio sighs. She can only hope Agatha gives her a chance to explain. </p><p>At least there's one positive, Rio muses to herself sarcastically.</p><p>She knows the gun isn't loaded.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The ride home is quiet and tense, both women stewing in their thoughts and lost in their own internal worlds, waiting until they get home to release the tension that lingers from Agatha's meet up with her mother. </p><p>When they step through the threshold, Agatha sheds her coat and shoes and Rio removes the gun from her jacket.</p><p>"I'm gonna put this in my safe."</p><p>Agatha doesn't argue, she just nods and stands a bit awkwardly between the living room and hallway like she doesn't know what to do with herself.</p><p>Rio can't help it, she needs to ask.</p><p>"How did you even-"</p><p>"Lilia. She got me into a license and handling class. Friend of a friend."</p><p>Agatha cuts Rio off, anticipating the question and running on the last fumes of her adrenaline. She really had taken inspiration from Rio's aunt and she arguably felt safer, especially if it intimidated Ralph enough to leave her alone, but the actual action of pointing a gun at someone was a whole different, and terrifying, level.</p><p>Rio nods and makes her way to the safe and punches in the code, laying the weapon alongside hers, popping the magazine and laying it separate.</p><p>When the firearms are secured, Rio sheds her jacket and walks back out finding Agatha leaning against the back of the couch, hands behind her back, looking like a child about to be chastised. </p><p>"Are you angry?" Agatha asks, looking up at Rio from under dark lashes. </p><p>Her makeup is lightly smudged but the dark mascara makes Agatha's eyes stand out like sapphires and Rio's chest squeezes, fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and touch.</p><p>"What? No, not at all," Rio is quick to reassure the omega, posture softening and dropping slightly on instinct to make herself less of a threat. </p><p>"I can smell it," Agatha points out and Rio ducks her head, blush coloring her cheeks instead of the flush of anger. </p><p>Rio realizes she probably smells insane to the omega and tries to calm herself down, taking a deep breath through her nose and reassembling her self-control.</p><p>"I'm not mad at <em>you</em>," Rio clarifies, exhaling.</p><p>Agatha's shoulders lose some of their tension as she exhales herself, seemingly holding her breath while waiting for Rio's answer. The alpha feels bad for making Agatha think she was upset with her but with a mother like Evanora, it doesn't surprise Rio that Agatha is waiting for some delayed punishment.</p><p>Agatha shifts her weight from foot to foot and Rio watches a few emotions flit across Agatha's face. The omega's nose scrunches, her lip pouts for a second then grows tense, pressing into a thin line, and her eyes dart back and forth, jumping from thought to thought in rapid succession. </p><p>"I guess I should say thank you, and...I suppose you were right," Agatha finally says. </p><p>There's a note of bitterness in her voice that worries Rio, expecting the wind storm of beratment is coming now that Agatha is in a place to process everything that happened.</p><p>"I don't understand, right about what?" Rio asks. </p><p>She's confused about where Agatha's thoughts have landed and mentally reviews their conversations, trying to remember if she ever inadvertently said something Agatha might misinterpret.</p><p>"Nevermind," Agatha frowns and twists her shoulders, ready to squeeze herself out from between the couch and Rio and retreat while the alpha panics, trying to fix it before Agatha tries to run. </p><p>Rio doesn't think she can go back to pretending something isn't happening between them, not without either of them eventually imploding in a mess of misdirected emotions. </p><p>Rio catches Agatha's arm before she can run away, a gentle hand that settles just below Agatha's shoulder, enough to stop her from leaving.</p><p>"No, no, no, wait, Agatha," The words rush from Rio's mouth, "I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha stops; her brow furrows and she turns back toward Rio.</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>Rio swallows, preparing to face Agatha's ire.</p><p>"For following you. I know you're probably really mad about it but I could tell you were upset and I was worried about you-"</p><p>"That's what I mean," Agatha cuts her off and shakes her head.</p><p>Rio is truly confused now, feeling like she's adrift at sea, searching for some kind of life line to point her toward shore.</p><p>Agatha continues, "You were right to be worried, is that what you want to hear?"</p><p>Rio scrunches her eyebrows and tilts her head, "No, why would I want to hear that?"</p><p>Agatha's shoulders lift and she raises a hand, gesturing toward nothing in general, her tone growing tense and hinting at accusation.</p><p>"Because clearly I need the help. If it weren't for you then-"</p><p>"That wasn't your fault, you didn't know he would be there," Rio interjects firmly. Agatha was ambushed, plain and simple and if anything, Rio places the responsibility on Evanora's shoulders. </p><p>"Then why are you apologizing?" Agatha narrows her eyes.</p><p>"You're not mad I followed you?" Rio asks.</p><p>"Doesn't everything that just happened prove you were right to do so?" Agatha huffs.</p><p>"I don't care about being right, I care if you're angry," Rio grumbles. </p><p>The alpha doesn't understand why Agatha is so stuck on this 'being right' thing; she can speculate, but right now she's focused on trying to untangle the strings Agatha has laid out before her.</p><p>"I'm angry because you won't tell me the truth!" Agatha crosses her arms over her chest but doesn't move away which Rio takes as a good sign.</p><p>"I'll have to get used to hearing it, I'm not so broken that I've lost all self-awareness."</p><p>Rio's gaze softens. No wonder Agatha is pushing at Rio and getting cagey, Agatha has already assumed Rio's intent; she's waiting for confirmation of what she thinks is true. </p><p>Rio sighs internally, feeling guilty for leaving Agatha to come up with her own explanations, turning inward after years of conditioning.</p><p>"What truth is that?" Rio asks quietly, stepping closer and squeezing Agatha's arm lightly to encourage her.</p><p>Agatha stubbornly turns her head to the side and leans heavily against the back of the couch.</p><p>"You're really going to make me say it?"</p><p>"Yes," Rio says quietly and Agatha's accusatory gaze snaps to Rio, "because I honestly don't know what you're talking about."</p><p>Agatha pouts and studies the alpha, trying to determine whether she's lying or not.</p><p>"No one wants a once-claimed omega," Agatha finally murmurs, dropping her eyes.</p><p>"And it's fine, I get it. Plus there's Ralph and Evanora-,"</p><p>"I want you," Rio says stone faced.</p><p>"-even I would say that's too mu- What did you say?"</p><p>Agatha stops, shocked and unsure if she heard the alpha correctly. </p><p>Her wide eyes fall on Rio's solemn expression, finding no sign of a smirk, no twitch in her eyebrow to show Rio is joking.</p><p>"I want you," the alpha repeats. </p><p>"No you don't," Agatha counters.</p><p>"I don't?" A smirk appears on Rio's lips.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"I thought we weren't telling people how they feel?" Rio raises a dark eyebrow, knowing she's caught Agatha in a double standard. </p><p>"You pushed me away," Agatha replies.</p><p>"I know," Rio nods.</p><p>"You said you were doing what's best for me."</p><p>Rio winces, "I did."</p><p>Agatha sighs and rubs a hand over her face, "Rio, please..."</p><p>"I'm terrified of you," Rio sticks her hands in her back pockets, shifting her weight onto her back foot.</p><p>"Of me?" Agatha asks, deadpan and unbelieving.</p><p>Rio nods once, "Yes."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because I don't want to hurt you," Rio rubs one foot over the other, nervous energy making it impossible for Rio to stand still. </p><p>"You haven't," Agatha replies without hesitation.</p><p>Rio makes a face, nose scrunching and lip curling. Her dark hair falls from behind her ear into her face and she tilts her head.</p><p>"I could...you saw what happened today, I've never lost control like that..."</p><p>Agatha can see the fluttering pulse in Rio's neck, heart beating hard enough to push against the surface of her skin like it wants to escape. Her voice is soft, whispered in a way that Agatha is familiar with, like saying it out loud will somehow give a fear strength to overpower.</p><p>"But that wasn't toward me," Agatha uncrosses her arms and rests them against the back of the couch, using her grip to steady herself, subconsciously bracing herself for the turbulence she can see brewing in Rio's eyes.</p><p>"But what if it was," Rio counters, tears gathering I'm her eyes.</p><p>"You think you'll hurt me?" Agatha asks softly.</p><p>"I don't want to but you just..." Rio starts and blows out a forceful breath, stemming her tears while Agatha waits tensely.</p><p>"I react so strongly to you and I can't control it. And it's terrifying because I don't know what will happen if I can't control these stupid urges. I'm too afraid to find out."</p><p>Rio's voice is taut and inwardly chiding and Agatha relaxes, understanding dawning on her like the first rays of morning sun.</p><p>"Because of your father?" Agatha questions and Rio nods, swiping at a stray tear.</p><p>"I can't do what he did, he couldn't control his possessiveness and it made him into a monster."</p><p>Agatha grips the back of the couch tighter to resist the urge to touch, "You're not a monster."</p><p>Rio's eyes cut to Agatha sharply, words coming before Rio can stop them, "Was Ralph a monster when you first met?"</p><p>Agatha inhales sharply, meeting the cutting edge of Rio's tongue for the first time. Her nails dig in to the fabric in her grasp, digging her claws in to repress the urge to snap back though she can't keep the distain from her voice.</p><p>"Ralph lied about who he was from the beginning, so yes, I guess he was," Agatha growls and Rio backs down, pressing her lips together tightly, recognizing her misstep.</p><p>There's a pause between them as Rio's anger tickles Agatha's nose, a campfire slowly growing toward a bonfire. </p><p>Rio grits her teeth as she asks, "Did he...did he really..."</p><p><em>"Please...stop."</em> Agatha's head pounds, starting in her temples and spreading down her neck. Again that dark corner of her mind calls, whispering to her while black tendrils pulse and search, growing stronger even as Agatha resists. </p><p>There's a feeling of dread in her stomach. Something deep inside her just <em>knows</em> if she lets herself get caught in that black abyss she'll disappear; floating away from her body, disconnected from her omega like losing a part of her soul.</p><p>Agatha forces herself to speak just to remind herself she can; like losing feeling in your foot and wiggling your toes to get the blood flowing; she needs to prove she's still in control of herself.</p><p>"He said I owed him," Agatha chokes and clears her throat, swallowing painfully as feeling returns to her body, thousands of tiny pin pricks running along her nerves like static on a tv. </p><p>"He used a pheromone push and I couldn't..." Agatha flexes her toes, grounding herself in the feeling of the rug beneath her feet and gripping the couch until her knuckles turn white. </p><p>"He's wrong, by the way," Rio jumps in when Agatha trails off. </p><p>"It's not natural to hurt your mate like that."</p><p>"No?" Agatha exhales, the tingling fades like a waning tide, leaving her shaky, grateful the couch is able to hold her up. Rio's hand hovers just next to Agatha's elbow, offering a steady guide in case Agatha needs it.</p><p>"No," Rio huffs, "An alpha's role is to protect, not rule."</p><p>"Is that what you're trying to do? Protect me from you?" </p><p>Agatha inhales, needing a breath, filling her senses with Rio's scent, bracing herself, worrying she'll be blanketed and smothered like she was with Ralph, fighting a bit until she realizes she's fine. </p><p>She can breathe. </p><p>Agatha curls her fingers around Rio's forearm, skin nearly hissing as her warmth collides with Rio's cold, tempering her heat like forged steel, adding strength to their connection.</p><p>"I guess so," Rio focuses on where Agatha's hand touches her, staying still as if Agatha will get spooked and run if she moves. </p><p>"I don't need protection from you," Agatha stares at Rio's profile while the alpha is distracted. </p><p>She watches Rio's pupils dilate and contract and the corner of her mouth twitches, prompting Rio to poke her tongue against her cheek and run it along her bottom teeth, biting down gently and releasing, lifting her eyes to level with Agatha.</p><p>"You don't know that," Rio murmurs. </p><p>"I do. I'd argue I'm the best person to know that," Agatha scoffs.</p><p>"I know what it's like to be afraid of someone who's supposed to care about you."</p><p>Agatha meets Rio's gaze, unflinching and determined.</p><p>"I'm not afraid of you."</p><p>"Maybe you should be," Rio growls and Agatha grinds her molars together.</p><p>"Prove it," Agatha growls back, unafraid to call Rio's bluff. </p><p>"Excuse me?" Rio reels back but Agatha tightens her grasp on Rio's arm lifitng the alpha's hand to her throat, pressing Rio's loose fingers against her rising pulse.</p><p>"You heard me," Agatha's eyes glint with challenge.</p><p>Rio glares at Agatha, "I'm not playing around, Agatha."</p><p>"Neither am I," Agatha shoots back, words vibrating against Rio's palm, pressing down harder when Rio tries to drop her hand.</p><p>"Go ahead," Agatha dares, "Show me why I should be afraid."</p><p>"Agatha, stop, this isn't funny," Rio snarls, baring her teeth in frustration, fingers twitching around the column of Agatha's pale neck, her alpha awakened by the temptation that sits in her hand, like fresh meat to a starving predator.</p><p>"You can't do it can you?" Agatha's grin grows feral, finding satisfaction at being able to get under Rio's skin and more so because she knows she's right.</p><p>"I want to," Rio growls deep enough Agatha can feel it when Rio steps closer, trapping her between the back of the couch and the alpha, except Agatha doesn't feel threatened. </p><p>She wants to offer herself instead; her body and omega recognizing the pull as desire when Rio's fingers tighten just a fraction against her neck.</p><p>"Then do it," Agatha lifts her chin defiantly.</p><p>Rio clenches her teeth together, growling noisily to vent her frustration and huffing as she grasps Agatha's jaw, turning her head severely to the side as Agatha gasps in surprise.</p><p>Rio holds her in place, her alpha humming in satisfaction when Agatha remains still. </p><p>She brushes her nose against Agatha's ear, nuzzling her and breathing deeply, growing drunk on her scent. Agatha's eyes flutter, her hand tightening around Rio's wrist in encouragement.</p><p>"You don't understand," Rio murmurs, nosing against Agatha's jaw, teasing her with light brushes of her lips. </p><p>"I want to but if we do this, if I have you, I won't be able to let you go," Rio makes a lazy path down Agatha's neck, scraping her teeth against the tendon that sticks out, begging for attention.</p><p>Agatha's shallow breaths echo in her ears; background noise to the spell Rio weaves, pulling Agatha tight and leaving her exposed for the taking.</p><p>Rio's lips travel to Agatha's ear, holding the omega's head in place so she's forced to look up at the ceiling while Rio's voice melts against her ear and liquifies her insides.</p><p>"I won't be able to have you just once," Rio murmurs and Agatha shudders, her hips twitching forward on instinct making contact for a brief second before Rio pulls her hips back, not wanting to take a chance in the moment.</p><p>"If I have you, you'll be mine in every sense."</p><p>Agatha can hear the promise in Rio's voice, the depth of her want that sits before Agatha like a crystal clear pool of water, tempting, transparent, and beautiful but intimidating in the unknown depth. She wants to look and dip her toe in slowly instead of sinking immediately below the surface.</p><p>"That's what I'm afraid of," Rio lets Agatha go, leaning back to put some space between them. Agatha's skin burns where Rio touched her, accutely missing the pressure. </p><p>"You're not an object, I know it's not right but I've never had the urge to possess someone the way I want to possess you," Rio looks up at Agatha from beneath her lashes.</p><p>"That's the truth."</p><p>Agatha swallows a few times, closing her eyes briefly in an attempt to stamp down her desire as her omega whines in protest.</p><p>Agatha still holds Rio's wrist. She lets go and turns her hand to slide her fingers against Rio's palm.</p><p>"I'm still not afraid of you, but I understand," Agatha sighs, not sure how to feel as her emotions swirl together; she's happy because Rio <em>does</em> want her but she hesitates, still healing from her last commitment.</p><p>Agatha traces her fingers over Rio's, pleased when the alpha spreads them to make room for Agatha, lacing together as Agatha's thumb traces the edge of Rio's palm, her touch almost ticklish but still pleasant enough to soothe.</p><p>"I thought maybe because of Ralph you didn't..." Agatha falters and rushes through the rest of her thoughts.</p><p>"I mean it's a lot, I'm... a lot. I would understand if that was part of the reason why-"</p><p>"You're not a lot," Rio cuts her off, squeezing Agatha's hand.</p><p>"I know Ralph or your mother might have made you feel like that but they're wrong."</p><p>Agatha lifts her free hand to cup Rio's cheek and the alpha covers it with her own hand, holding Agatha in place and pressing her cheek into the touch.</p><p>"And your father might have made you feel like a monster but he's wrong," Agatha argues and Rio huffs, mildly annoyed Agatha turns her own words against her but above the annoyance is a fondness; Agatha keeps her on her toes.</p><p>"I guess your mommy issues complement my daddy issues," Rio concedes.</p><p>"I guess so," Agatha smiles triumphantly and rubs her thumb against Rio's cheek.</p><p>"I like being around you," Agatha whispers. "I feel safe with you," Agatha smiles when she sees the corner of Rio's lips twitch upward.</p><p>"I don't know if I'm ready for something that intense," Agatha continues, feeling her chest swell. </p><p>"But I can't stop thinking about you."</p><p>Rio's growl is a low pleased hum as she leans forward and presses her forehead against Agatha's.</p><p>"You have no idea how obsessed with you I am," Rio purrs and Agatha chuckles.</p><p>"I have an idea. You're not exactly subtle," Agatha teases. </p><p>"It's either that or you really do think I'm helpless."</p><p>"Anything but," Rio brushes her nose against Agatha's, enjoying the playful reprieve from the heavy conversation. </p><p>"If you ever want to practice shooting I can take you to the range," Rio grins and uses their linked hands to draw Agatha forward, closing the gap between their bodies and wrapping her arm around Agatha's lower back, lightly trapping Agatha's arm behind her. </p><p>"I could help you with your form?"</p><p>Agatha grins, "Just my form?"</p><p>"You did look really good holding a pistol," Rio hums as her brain recalls the mental image.</p><p>"But watching you disassemble it was hotter."</p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha breathes, her fingers sliding against Rio's cheek to thread through her hair, scratching lightly against her scalp.</p><p>"Competence is sexy," Rio brushes her lips over Agatha's, teasing and brief.</p><p>"And you are incredibly competent."</p><p>Agatha tilts her head just in time for Rio's lips to crash into hers, overwhelming Agatha all at once after so much teasing; sending sparks of heat and arousal all the way down to her toes as she parts her lips, eagerly making room for Rio's tongue to slide against hers, a relieved moan rising from her throat, drawing an answering groan from Rio as she tilts her head, desperate to get closer.</p><p>Agatha tears her lips away when her lungs scream for air, wiggling her hand free from Rio's grasp to join the other in the alpha's hair, drawing her in for a slower kiss, lips moving together and teasing the alpha with gentle swipes of a playful tongue. </p><p>Rio's arms wrap around Agatha's waist and back, holding her as their impromptu make out session comes to a natural end.</p><p>"Wait for me?" Agatha pants. She knows it's a lot to ask the other woman but Agatha has never been good at letting go of something she wants. And she wants to explore whatever this is between her and Rio, but she needs to do it at her own pace, dismantling her insecurities and learned behaviors to be a better omega for the other woman.</p><p>The thought strikes Agatha; she's never wanted to be a 'good omega' per se, but her instinct with Rio leaves room for some allowance, offering glimpses of submission which is terrifying and exhilarating...</p><p>And addictive.</p><p>"For how long?" Rio asks, rubbing her hand between Agatha's shoulder blades. She doesn't need an exact date but Rio would like to know they're working toward something, her alpha and Rio herself can be patient as long as Agatha is near. </p><p>"Just until I catch up to you," Agatha combs her fingers through Rio's hair, enjoying the way the dark strands look like living ink against her pale skin.</p><p>Agatha curls her fingers, massaging Rio's scalp lightly.</p><p>"You had a point, there's a lot I have to do and I should really find my own place-"</p><p>"Stay," Rio mumbles, laying her head on Agatha's shoulder, nuzzling her neck as Agatha continues massaging.</p><p>"Is that a good idea?" Agatha asks, half-serious as Rio brushes over her previous mate's mark, making Agatha jump in surprise.</p><p>"Mhm," Rio hums distractedly, nipping at the soft skin just below Agatha's ear.</p><p>"Rio... " Agatha's fingers tighten in Rio's hair. "This would be why it's a bad idea..."</p><p>"Leaving is worse," Rio counters and her alpha agrees whole heartedly.</p><p>"Then you have to behave," Agatha chuckles, tugging Rio's hair lightly until the alpha lets up and huffs.</p><p>"Fine," Rio grumbles reluctantly as she pouts. </p><p>"Are you really alright," Rio pulls back to study Agatha's face with concern.</p><p>She gives in to her protective instinct now that Agatha is aware of how insane the alpha is, but she doesn't care. Knowing the encounter probably scared the omega, Rio wants to be sure Agatha is okay.</p><p>Agatha wraps her arms around Rio's neck, "Yeah, I'll be fine."</p><p>"I'm here," Rio presses her forehead against Agatha's and the omega smiles, hearing the promise behind her words.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>-------------</p><p>The next Monday, Rio is reviewing a potential new case file when Alice plops down in the chair opposite her desk, startling Rio from her reading.</p><p>"Okay, so what happened?" Alice asks, cutting straight to the point.</p><p>"Need more details," Rio bookmarks her spot and calms her heart before she turns her attention to Alice.</p><p>"I get a heads up text from my partner that you might get a write up cause you, quote 'might have fucked up' yet here you are smiling like an idiot. What gives?"</p><p>Oh, right. Rio forgot she'd texted Alice, very much distracted by the new development between her and Agatha and taking advantage of every opportunity to be close to the omega.</p><p>"I might have tackled Ralph Boehner..."</p><p>Alice's mouth drops open, teeth digging into her bottom lip as she exclaims, "Fuuuuuuu-"</p><p>"Yeah," Rio grimaces. </p><p>Alice leans forward and scoots her chair closer.</p><p>"This is going to be good."</p><p>Rio sighs and leans back in her chair.</p><p>"Agatha went to talk to her mother. Mother didn't say she was bringing Ralph," Rio sums up the interaction as succinctly as possible.</p><p>Alice whistles low.</p><p>"So what'd he do?" Alice pushes, hungry for more details.</p><p>"Tried to convince her he's innocent and call off the divorce. Then he tried to grab her."</p><p>Alice sucks her teeth and shakes her head.</p><p>"Did you do that staple move I taught you?" She asks after a pause.</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>Alice brightens and sits up excitedly.</p><p>"Wish I coulda seen it. Bet your knee was turned wrong," she teases Rio.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, "Shut up."</p><p>"So," Alice rests her chin in her hand and tilts her head mischievously, "Judging by your smile I'm guessing Agatha said thank you multiple times?"</p><p>Rio suppresses a bashful grin and avoids eye contact.</p><p>"Not exactly," she mumbles and Alice is shocked once again.</p><p>"You're telling me you're this happy and you didn't even..."</p><p>"We talked," Rio cuts her off, cheeks burning but still relieved that her friend seems to be supportive.</p><p>"Talked or <em>talked</em>?" Alice wiggles her eyebrows and Rio rolls her eyes again, grinning.</p><p>"I told her how I feel."</p><p>Alice nods in approval, "And?" </p><p>"She likes me but you know...everything going on plus the divorce," Rio shrugs and Alice sits up, remembering her original reason for seeking out her partner.</p><p>"Speaking of, the court date for Versa got pushed back again," The shorter alpha relays as Rio's lip curls.</p><p>"What's the reason this time?"</p><p>"Life mitigating factors," Alice repeats with heavy sarcasm and air quotes. "Three of the four partners are in domestic upheaval due to the introduction of evidence."</p><p>Rio scoffs, "Meaning their wives are dumping their asses?"</p><p>"Yup," Alice pops the 'p' with irritation. "Outcomes determine whether we can compel them to testify against their partners."</p><p>"Pricks," Rio grumbles but Alice isn't done.</p><p>"In the mean time prosecutors still want more solid evidence these guys are connected to the development of the drugs. They're complaining what we got is circumstantial."</p><p>Rio wipes her hand over her face and groans, "The trial data and the finances weren't enough?"</p><p>"Not enough to make it a sure thing," Alice sighs.</p><p>"So what do we do?"</p><p>"Dig again and see if we missed anything that can create a concrete connection," Alice deadpans, delivering the bad news. Doubling back again means long hours with stacks of paper, reviewing the most tedious details while trying not to die from boredom. </p><p>"Goddamnit," Rio sighs and pulls her phone from her pocket, typing quickly.</p><p>"I'll buy the first round of coffee," Alice consoles.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Across town at the White Tail, Agatha's phone pings with a text from Rio.</p><p>
<em>"Got hit with follow up work on versa case. Won't be able to meet up with you and Jen."</em>
</p><p>Agatha frowns but types back quickly.</p><p>
<em>"It's okay, I'll see you at home."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"8 o'clock at the latest. I'll duct tape Alice to her chair if I need to."</em>
</p><p>Agatha grins and bites her lower lip.</p><p>
<em>"Kinky."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"You have no idea."</em>
</p><p>"You are literally bright red and I know you don't read fairy smut. Did Agent Vidal send a picture? I want to see," Jen shatters Agatha's reverie with all the subtly of a sledgehammer.</p><p>"No, you perv," Agatha holds her phone out of Jen's reach and swats at her hand.</p><p>"So it's not a pic?" Jen gives up and goes back to stabbing at her crushed ice with her straw.</p><p>"No," Agatha glares at Jen.</p><p>"But it <em>is</em> from Agent Vidal?" Jen grins and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "You can call her Rio."</p><p>"Yeah but you turn red when I call her Agent Vidal," Jen side eyes Agatha who does just that, a light pink dusting the apples of her cheeks.</p><p>"Bitch," Agatha hides her smile behind a sip from her glass of wine.</p><p>"So what did she say?"</p><p>"She can't make it. Late work night."</p><p>"Good. Now I don't feel so bad asking if you've slept with her yet."</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes briefly in exasperation.</p><p>"Jesus..."</p><p>"It's Jennifer actually," the other omega shoots back.</p><p>"Even demons have legal names I suppose," Agatha raises both eyebrows and puts her glass back down, fiddling with the stem.</p><p>"Answer the question," Jen picks up a garlic fry and points it at Agatha.</p><p>"No. I haven't," Agatha glares half-heartedly.</p><p>"Seriously?" Jen looks at Agatha quizzically.</p><p>"With the way she looks at you I'm surprised you're even standing."</p><p>Agatha snorts, if only Jen knew. </p><p>"It's complicated."</p><p>"I fail to see why," Jen scoffs, picking around for the crispier fries while Agatha is happy to eat what's left.</p><p>"You like her, she is obviously into you, why not have some fun now that you can?"</p><p>"That's why it's complicated she's not really into the whole 'fling' idea," Agatha explains, stealing one of Jen's discarded fries.</p><p>Jen makes a face, "Oh god is she a clinger?"</p><p>"Yes and no, I mean...she's had flings but she says if we do anything, she wants to be all in," Agatha sighs, wondering again if it's a good idea to even entertain the thought.</p><p>"Okay so?" Jen catches the attention of the bartender, ordering another drink for herself while Agatha refuses another glass of wine for the moment. </p><p>Agatha waits for the bartender to move on to another customer before she answers.</p><p>"So isn't it too soon?" Agatha murmurs.</p><p>"I'm not even fully divorced yet and I'm moving on? Isn't that just falling into stereotypes? Not to mention how it'll look to a judge or anyone else for that matter."</p><p>Agatha lifts her glass and finishes the rest of her wine.</p><p>"Also, being sick was awful, I don't want to go through that again if it doesn't work."</p><p>"First of all, you're not getting mated right away, <em>that</em> would be insane. And second, you don't think it would work with her?" Jen asks, her tone neutral.</p><p>"I do, but there's always the possibility it won't."</p><p>Jen rolls her eyes and waves her hand dismissively, "Isn't that every relationship though? You did everything right with Ralph and look how that turned out."</p><p>"Please, stab the knife in further I think you missed my heart," Agatha replies flippantly.</p><p>"The point," Jen says firmly, "Is that you can do everything right and things still go wrong. So why worry about it being too soon or whatever else anyone thinks? Stop worrying about whether you're doing things right and just do them because you want to."</p><p>Agatha stares at her best friend with suspicion, "What's your angle here?"</p><p>Jen shrugs, "What do you think it is?"</p><p>Agatha answers with her own question, "You couldn't wait for me to leave Ralph, you never liked him and now you're shoving me at another alpha?"</p><p>"I'm shoving you toward Rio," Jen specifies, dusting her hands off and wiping them with her napkin to list her arguments on her fingers. </p><p>"You tried to bring her to meet me and you haven't even slept together. It took you a year to bring Ralph over and you were dating for two years by then."</p><p>Agatha scrunches her nose.</p><p>"She's exactly who Evanora would hate which is wonderful; if Evanora is miserable then you're doing something right."</p><p>Agatha can't really argue with that one.</p><p>"Lastly," Jen finishes, "You don't act any different around her. You're the same with her as you are with me."</p><p>Okay that one hits a little too close for Agatha's liking. She didn't use to think she acted differently when Ralph was around but she recalls how little she saw Jen after college and even less after getting married and wonders how she lost herself so quickly.</p><p>Her head pounds and she orders a water for herself.</p><p>"I can't stop thinking about what if it's a bad idea? What if it's terrible?" Agatha sips from her glass, trying to quell her headache before it begins.</p><p>"Then we figure it out," Jen replies easily, shoving the rest of the fries toward Agatha. </p><p>"We?" Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Yes," Jen scoffs, "<em>We</em>, bitch."</p><p>Agatha takes a few fries, enjoying the grease and salt she hasn't had for a long time, taking comfort in carbs and the omega's support. </p><p>She doesn't know what she's done to deserve it but it's a reminder that she's not alone.</p><p>Agatha thinks of Rio and smiles to herself again, despite Jen's knowing look.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In bed at the end of the night, Agatha eventually ends up where she wants to be but the path there winds in absurd directions she never could have predicted.</p><p>She pulls the covers up over her chest, the world finally silent enough in the hours past midnight to give Agatha a chance to reflect on the upheaval of the last few hours.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha thought about her conversation with Jen on the ride home from the White Tail, weighing what she wanted versus what others thought and what she 'should' be doing. The battle felt never ending, stuck in a loop because as much as she tried not to care, Agatha longed for approval.</p><p>That's what it came down to every time. Acceptance versus rejection and the mother wound that festered like cancer in her soul, taking healthy parts of her and corrupting them into twisted unrecognizable masses of darkness. </p><p>The worst part is no matter what she chose, Agatha had to deal with disapproval and she hated being a disappointment. Sure she could deal with it, often becoming whatever moniker was bestowed on her; disappointment, bitch, hag, smart ass; just to cut the shit and because if she proved them right then people left her alone. </p><p>It wasn't worth the effort to prove someone wrong when they only doubled down, certain that Agatha was who they say. Most already made up their mind about her, so why bother?</p><p>
<em>So then why not do what you want?</em>
</p><p>Her thoughts circled right back to her conversation with Jen and she started the whole train of thought over again as her Uber stopped at a red light.</p><p>The most important thing was to focus on the divorce which Agatha had already been doing, still waiting for a response from Ralph's lawyers who claimed the federal charges were keeping them busy. Agatha knew it was bullshit; a common tactic to delay which foreshadowed a potentially messy mediation. </p><p>It was an almost insulting excuse when Agatha was an attorney herself but she could do nothing but wait for them or for the deadline to respond to pass.</p><p>So much waiting.</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily.</p><p>The street lights lit up the car in intervals, outlines of homes passed by the window in blurs; lights were on inside as families ate dinner or spent time together at the end of the day.</p><p>Agatha had dreamt of that life once. </p><p>The car dropped her off in front of Rio's dark house, driving away as Agatha checked the mail and walked up to the front door and let herself inside, noting the time. 7:30p.</p><p>Rio would be home soon. </p><p>She removed her coat and placed the mail on the dining room table, wondering if she should make something to eat. If Rio and Alice were as busy as Rio implied, there was a good chance they skipped dinner.</p><p>Agatha moved around the kitchen, lost in her thoughts as she turned on the gas stove, fantasizing about what could happen if she gave in and let herself be swept into Rio.</p><p>A heated rush of warmth climbed Agatha's neck. </p><p>She had no doubt they would be fine in bed. Her omega responded to Rio whenever she was near, attention focused and needy though Agatha actively ignored the needy part of her instinct; conditioned to be wary of dependence since childhood.</p><p>But what happens after they get their fill? </p><p>Agatha knew about her dark side but was Rio prepared to deal with it? Was Agatha able to deal with the monster Rio claimed was in her DNA? Agatha had already gotten a glimpse of the lethal predator and she tried to imagine that fury directed at her.</p><p>She pictured snapping fangs and a booming voice as she came face to face with Rio. Agatha thought about being faced with a snarl and lips curled so fiercely it morphed Rio into a grotesque and hungry demon.</p><p>Agatha visualized it and, like an idiot with no self-preservation instinct, she wanted to reach out and pet.</p><p>Her omega had no fear, she wanted only to soothe, not believing for a moment that Rio would hurt her.</p><p>Agatha chose a pot and placed it on the range the same time she heard a crunch on the gravel that lined the side of the house. </p><p>Agatha paused to listen but when no other sound followed, she brushed it off and sliced a pad of butter into the heated pot.</p><p>While she sautéed the carrots, celery, and onion, Agatha felt her headache return, cursing herself for drinking wine on a mostly empty stomach.</p><p>Her headaches were starting to increase in frequency and seemed to spike after seeing Ralph and Evanora. Agatha had dealt with persistant headaches before but she chalked it up to increased stress and the fact she hadn't had a weekend away in a while to decompress. </p><p>These days it seemed like anything could trigger a headache and that included alcohol.</p><p>The vegetables had about ten more minutes so Agatha made herself a glass of ice water. </p><p>Cubes tumbled from the automatic dispenser on the fridge and hummed loudly as a thump from the living room made Agatha freeze in place.</p><p>It sounded like a bird hitting the window. </p><p>Agatha eyed her cooking for a second before she walked into the next room to check if anything fell. </p><p>Finding nothing out of place, Agatha checked the window, expecting to see a flurry of feathers or possibly a stunned pigeon walking it off. </p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The streetlights were on, yellow light bathed the sidewalk but no people or animals were out on the street or within sight.</p><p>Slightly unsettled, Agatha returned to the kitchen and stirred the vegetables to be sure they didn't stick to the bottom of the pot, adding the garlic and seasoning and flour in quick succession. </p><p>Maybe the stress was getting to her. It's possible her body had finally processed the events in the park, making her more sensitive to her environment. </p><p>Agatha checked the time. 7:50p. </p><p>The doorknob shook. </p><p>Agatha assumed Rio was home but the longer the lock jiggled, the more paranoid Agatha became; the locks worked smoothly, Rio wouldn't have this much trouble opening the door.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her phone and a kitchen knife while she approached the door slowly.</p><p>When she got closer, Agatha heard something that sounded like metal scraping on metal. </p><p>Her pulse skyrocketed and she gripped the handle of the knife tightly. </p><p>Something clicked and the knob twisted again and Agatha braced herself wishing she had her gun.</p><p>The deadbolt caught.</p><p>Agatha's phone rang.</p><p>She jumped, nearly throwing the device in the process. </p><p>Agatha pressed answer and eyed the now silent door.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>
<em>"It's me."</em>
</p><p>Agatha exhaled when she heard Rio's voice and shifted her weight, anxious for the alpha to get home.</p><p>"Where are you?" Agatha answered tersely.</p><p><em>"I was gonna ask you the same thing,"</em> Rio replied breathlessly. Her voice echoed in Agatha's ear; she was on speaker phone.</p><p>"I'm at home."</p><p><em>"Good,"</em> Rio confirmed. <em>"I'm five minutes away."</em></p><p>"Rio, I think someone was trying to get in the front door," Agatha breathed, still watching the entrance just in case. </p><p><em>"Don't move, don't open the door,"</em> Rio replied urgently. <em>"Two minutes."</em></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Agatha expected Rio to push it off until they could talk in person but Rio answered immediately, the timbre of her voice tinged with anxiety.</p><p>
<em>"One of the mates of a VersaRX partner was just found dead in her apartment. It looks like an accidental overdose but no timeline has been confirmed."</em>
</p><p>Agatha's blood turned to ice. She wanted to ask which one, knowing whoever it was Agatha would know them, having grown familiar through shared connection through their husbands and later through shared trauma of the drug trials. </p><p>One was Brenda, a curvy brunette who was pleasant enough, eager to make friends though Agatha would rather not. Her overly cheerful mask made Agatha uncomfortable, she supposed it was a coping mechanism, though it wasn't a good one. Agatha could see the distress behind her green eyes and her smiles seemed forced and painful.</p><p>The other was Katie...Kendall? Kelly. Whatever, she was the child married to Paul. </p><p>The fourth mate, Elizabeth, was standing by her husband Ronald, refuting the charges levied against him and outright denounced the drug trial evidence as fake. Agatha had tried to reach out to her through email only to be met with hostility.</p><p>Agatha had left her alone after that.</p><p><em>"Agatha?"</em> Rio's voice was in her ear and Agatha snapped back to attention. </p><p>"I'm here."</p><p>
<em>"I'm outside. No footprints but one of the plant pots is on the ground and the lock has scratches on it."</em>
</p><p>Footsteps approached the front door.</p><p><em>"Can you open the door?"</em> Rio spoke and Agatha could hear her voice both in her ear and on the other side of the door. </p><p>Feeling safer, Agatha lowered the knife.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Agatha clicked the deadbolt open while she hung up and Rio stepped through the door, keeping her hands off of the doorknob in an attempt to preserve possible evidence. </p><p>Before Rio could ask if she was okay, the smoke detector in the kitchen started beeping, and the smell of burning food finally made it to the front of the house.</p><p>Agatha rushed back to the kitchen and ditched the knife and removed the pot from the stove, turning off the burner in the process. </p><p>Rio followed her into the kitchen, opening a window to air out the smoke while Agatha scraped the ruined food into the sink and placed the pan inside to let it cool off before she rinsed it.</p><p>Placing her hands on the edge of the counter, Agatha sighed and tried to gather her thoughts while her headache returned full force, spreading down her neck and up to her temples. </p><p>Rio's nose scrunched and she stepped closer to Agatha, smelling the scent of her distress. </p><p>"Who?" Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>"Kelly Monreau," Rio answered.</p><p>Agatha felt her disgust rise. The girl was barely into her twenties, dragged into this mess by a predatory alpha who wanted nothing more than a pretty young thing on his arm. </p><p>Yes, Agatha had snapped at her and made snide comments; she wanted the girl to get out, to get smarter and leave the alpha instead of wasting her best years with a prick.</p><p>Now she's dead.</p><p>Agatha wondered if this is what Rio felt like watching Agatha live the same life not so long ago. </p><p>"Elizabeth is at home. Agents are checking on Brenda Moore now," Rio continued. "And I'm checking on you."</p><p>Rio finally placed her hand on Agatha's shoulder, turning the omega to face her.</p><p>"Tell me what happened," Rio asked quietly, falling back on her professional training to help steady the omega.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath and folded her arms over her middle.</p><p>"I thought I heard something a few times while I was cooking and then it sounded like something hit the front window but nothing was there when I checked," Agatha exhaled and squeezed her arms. </p><p>"Then I heard the door. It sounded like someone was trying to get in so I grabbed a knife and then you called."</p><p>When Agatha finished she exhaled again, not realizing she started to hyperventilate until Rio wrapped her arms around her body and held her tightly, grounding Agatha with her embrace. </p><p>Agatha buried her face in the alpha's shoulder, hiding herself in Rio's scent. She let it cover her like a waterfall forcefully washing away the panic that permeated from Agatha's skin, cleansing her until all Agatha could smell was Rio. </p><p>"It might be a good idea to move you and Brenda to safe locations," Rio rubbed her hand over Agatha's back, swaying gently.</p><p>"Are you coming with me?" Agatha asked through a shuddering breaths.</p><p>"Can't get rid of me that easily," Rio hummed and Agatha laughed weakly. </p><p>"Pack for at least a week," Rio advised when Agatha pulled away. "Hopefully it'll be shorter than that but just in case."</p><p>Agatha nodded and the two women went to their respective rooms to pack while Rio waited for further instruction from her team's supervisors. </p><p>Agatha grabbed her essentials; clothes, toiletries, her meds which she was thankfully back on, and her glasses. </p><p>When she went to grab her computer, Agatha remembered the hard drive she had packed with her things when she left Ralph. It had all her important documents and information and she didn't feel comfortable leaving it behind.</p><p>Digging through her suitcase, Agatha found the external hard drive and went to put it in her computer bag only to find her external hard drive already there.</p><p>Agatha was confused. The hard drive in her hand and the one in her bag looked identical save for a small SD card slot on the hard drive she held. </p><p>A knock on her door distracted Agatha and she threw the hard drive into her computer bag as Rio appeared in the doorway to her room. </p><p>"Brenda Moore is in a coma," Rio said solemnly. "She was found near an overpass by a dog walker. The assumption is she jumped."</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio; her own suspicion and fear reflected back at her. One death might have been a coincidence. Agatha had originally thought the intruder could be Ralph or someone connected with him, but a second mate in one night is too much to ignore.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to ask what was going on because it was clear Rio had no idea either by the way she checked her phone every few seconds and typed out quick replies over text.</p><p>Agatha finished packing and followed Rio to the living room where a black duffel bag sat on the leather chair. Placing her rolling bag with Rio's, Agatha sat on the couch, running her fingers through her hair.</p><p>"Pick up in five minutes," Rio updated Agatha, sitting next to her on the couch.</p><p>The quiet descended between them, Rio leaned into Agatha, their shoulders pressed together in quiet support. </p><p>"How was drinks with Jen?" Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply on a laugh. She threaded her fingers together and leaned forward with her elbows on her knees.</p><p>"It was good. She likes you more than Ralph already."</p><p>"Not hard when the bar is in hell," Rio smirked.</p><p>Headlights shone into the living room when a black sedan pulled into Rio's driveway and the two women stood up in anticipation, opening the door to greet Alice and another blonde female agent. </p><p>"Good to see you, Belova," Rio greeted, shaking the shorter agent's hand. "This is Agatha Harkness."</p><p>"Agent Yelena Belova," the agent introduced herself, offering a polite but brief handshake. </p><p>The agent's scent reminded Agatha of bitter almonds, seemingly harmless but truly deadly. Like poison, <em>cyanide</em>, Agatha realized, recognizing her immediately as an omega. </p><p>Agatha followed Rio's lead. The alpha seemed confident in the younger woman and Agatha was sure the other omega worked harder than most to get to where she was, so she had Agatha's immediate respect.</p><p>"Door and the perimeter of the house," Rio instructed Yelena who nodded and put on a pair of gloves she pulled from her jacket pocket. The woman prepared to collect evidence as her eyes started to scan the immediate area. </p><p>"Any bugs or cameras?" Yelena asked.</p><p>"Not on initial sweep," Rio answered. </p><p>Next to her, Rio caught Agatha's quizzical expression and explained, "Yelena will stay here to collect evidence and wait for CSI, Alice is gonna drive us to a secure location."</p><p>Alice gave a terse nod, the normally genial alpha was solemn and focused now that the stakes had been raised. </p><p>"Vidal," Yelena called from behind them. She had already started a sweep of the front door area and crouched down by the welcome mat, crooking her finger as she beckoned them over. </p><p>Rio, Alice, and Agatha were beside her in a second as Yelena pointed to a white corner of paper that poked out from under the mat.</p><p>Using her gloved hands, Yelena pulled out the paper that turned out to be about the size of a Post-It note. </p><p>Rio read it first and her eyes cut to Agatha who needed to squint and lean down to read without her glasses. </p><p>"Bag it," Rio instructed and jerked her chin toward Alice and Agatha, "Let's go."</p><p>The words focused after a moment:</p><p align="center">
<em>You should have stayed.</em>
</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha takes a slow breath as she remembers the chill that ran down her spine in the moment. </p><p>She has no doubt Ralph is involved some how but to what degree she isn't sure. Agatha hesitates to say it out loud but signs point to a conspiracy. </p><p>With one mate dead and another hospitalized and unresponsive, Agatha and Elizabeth are the only mates left unharmed and Agatha can only assume she is next.</p><p>The only thing she can't understand is why?</p><p>It's one thing to be upset about a divorce, it's another to kill over it, no matter how high profile. </p><p>And to go after the three who left their mates? </p><p>What did the three of them have that would be worth going through this trouble?</p><p>Agatha turns over, facing the wall as her mind continues to playback the night.</p><p>-------------</p><p>After what felt like hours, Alice pulled up to a small cabin with a slanted roof in the woods.</p><p>Agatha couldn't see much of the exterior in the dark but once inside Rio found the light switch and Agatha could see the modest space was just big enough for two people. </p><p>There were stairs and a loft that Agatha presumed was a sleeping area, but most of the space was taken up by a seating area, kitchen, and fire place. The word 'cozy' popped into Agatha's mind as she set her bag on the grey L-shaped sectional.</p><p>Rio and Alice talked for a few moments by the door before Alice patted Rio's arm and stepped back out. The sedan started again and the headlights faded as Alice pulled away. </p><p>"Alice will be back tomorrow morning to check in," Rio said quietly once they were alone. </p><p>"It's a nice place," Agatha answered, looking around at the mix of modern appliances and rustic wood.</p><p>"Alice said the bathroom is on the bottom level, you can use it first," Rio offered as she headed toward the stairs to check out the sleeping arrangements. </p><p>Agatha nodded and took her toiletries and change of clothes to the surprisingly spacious bathroom that included a tub and shower, plus 'his and hers' sinks. </p><p>Whatever luxury was lacking in the rest of the cabin was made up in the indulgent design of the bathroom; a small comfort when she had expected a water closet and a stand up corner shower.</p><p>By the time Agatha changed, readied herself for bed, and left the bathroom, Rio was downstairs, tossing the throw pillows to the side as she spread out a blanket. </p><p>"What are you doing?" Agatha asked as she packed her dirty clothes in a separate bag to be washed later. </p><p>"Uh, there's only one bed upstairs," Rio explained. "The couch is big enough, we can take turns if it makes you feel better?"</p><p>"We could share," Agatha offered. She didn't particularly want to be alone in a strange bed in a new place; she felt safer with Rio close. </p><p>"If it's okay with you," Agatha added a moment later. </p><p>Rio looked at her, mouth opening and closing a couple times before she made a sound. </p><p>"Yeah," Rio shook her head and snapped out of her daze. "Yeah, that's fine."</p><p>The alpha took out a black toiletry bag from her duffel and nodded toward the bathroom.</p><p>"I'm gonna get ready for bed. I'll... see you up there?"</p><p>Agatha nodded, "Sounds good."</p><p>The omega carried her small rolling bag up the flight of stairs. The floor opened up at the top of the stairs and revealed a single king sized bed in the opposite corner; the area was bordered by a black iron railing and sported sparse bookshelves with hotel-like decorations and a large skylight on the slanted roof above the bed. </p><p>Agatha placed her bag at the foot of the bed and set up her phone charger on the night stand, not bothering to turn on the lamp as she climbed into the right side of the bed, facing the stairs as she listened and waited for Rio. </p><p>The sounds from downstairs were faint but Agatha was able to track Rio's movement; her footsteps were nearly silent but the wooden floors creaked under her weight. </p><p>The downstairs light turned off and soon after the stairs cracked and Rio's silhouette appeared, highlighted by the moonlight filtering through the window. </p><p>Agatha watched Rio pause and round the bed toward the left side, lifting the covers and sliding under while leaving a respectful amount of space between them.</p><p>The bed dipped under Rio's weight and Agatha curled up on her side facing her, hands tucked under her chin as she waited for Rio to settle. </p><p>Rio curled her arm under her pillow and laid on her side to face Agatha. </p><p>"What are you thinking?" Rio asked as she stared at Agatha.</p><p>"A lot," Agatha murmured. "Kelly, Brenda, Ralph, the note..." she trailed off. </p><p>"None of this feels real," Agatha confessed.</p><p>"It could be shock," Rio whispered.</p><p>"Great so it'll hit me later when I'm least expecting it?" Agatha huffed. </p><p>Rio laughed softly in sympathy, "It might. I remember my first major case. I thought I was a bad ass because I walked away not feeling anything. Everything hit me three days later and I had a panic attack in the shower."</p><p>"Comforting," Agatha deadpanned. </p><p>"You don't have to deal with it alone," Rio reached across the space between them to grasp Agatha's hand.</p><p>Agatha linked their fingers together, "Thank you. Please remember you said that when I'm a mess on the kitchen floor."</p><p>Rio smirked and squeezed Agatha's hand, "I'll mop it so at least it's clean."</p><p>Agatha smiled and stifled a yawn. Rio scooted forward enough to let go of Agatha's hand and put her hand on Agatha's arm, prompting Agatha to move forward and tuck herself under Rio's chin while the alpha laid her arm over Agatha's waist. </p><p>It wasn't sensual or amorous, there was just a need to touch and reassure. Agatha needed something solid and safe and reached for Rio, like seeking sanctuary in the hollow of a tree as thunder boomed and rain fell in sheets. </p><p>Agatha's breathing evened out. She didn't know what time it was but her head throbbed lightly and she felt comfortable and exhausted and Rio smelled nice.</p><p>Her body sensed safety, falling quickly to the pull of sleep.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Bright overhead lights shone down, blinding Agatha while her eyelids blinked slowly. </p><p>A high pitched beep was the only consistent sound, beeping rhythmically in intervals.</p><p>She wanted to leave but she couldn't move.</p><p>Agatha forced her head to turn, sea-green surgical gowns moved past her vision and a gloved hand touched her wrist, tobacco and patchouli filled her senses and her body ached to move away. </p><p>
<em>"Please...stop."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"It's okay, sweetheart, I'm right here."</em>
</p><p>Her head hurt, she wanted to go home, she wanted Rio.</p><p>With herculean effort, Agatha ripped her body from the bed and forced herself forward. She knew if she could make it to the door she could escape. Rio was just outside the door, Agatha felt it.</p><p>"<em>Relax, Agatha</em>," a soothing voice called to her and Agatha fought to ignore it. She couldn't feel the bottom half of her body, couldn't make her legs move, she had used all her reserved strength at once, her resistance shattered.</p><p>"<em>Rio</em>," Agatha tried to yell but nothing came from her throat. </p><p>Her arm burned and Agatha looked down, wires and tubes hung down, pulling her backward toward the bed. </p><p>"<em>No</em>," she begged.</p><p>No matter how hard she struggled, Agatha slid backward and when she turned to look over her shoulder, Agatha saw only darkness and oblivion.</p><p>Her muscles tensed and she felt the jagged edge of the cavernous drop beneath her feet. She knew she was about to lose the fight.</p><p>With the last of her strength she screamed.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha gasped awake.</p><p>Her arm flailed out and hit something solid and warm that made her jump; ready to flee as her legs kicked out.</p><p>"It's me! Agatha, it's me," Rio whispered loudly, her arm was up to block Agatha from hitting her accidentally as she sat up and squinted.</p><p>Agatha swallowed and fell back onto her pillow as she panted and tried to catch her breath. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she could see Rio above her as she looked down in concern. </p><p>A nightmare. It was just a nightmare.</p><p>It took Agatha a second to remember where she was and how she got there. The events of the past twenty-four hours caught up to her all at once and she rubbed a hand over her face and pushed her hair back.</p><p>"Bad dream?" Rio asked as she rubbed her hand over Agatha's stomach.</p><p>The muscles beneath Rio's fingers jumped and Agatha nodded.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Rio inquired gently.</p><p>Agatha debated whether she wanted to or not, already the dream was fading back into her subconscious and left only bits and pieces of scenes and emotional impressions that felt real.</p><p>"I couldn't escape, you were there but I couldn't see you, I couldn't get to you," Agatha rubbed her eyes until white bursts clouded her vision.</p><p>Rio frowned, "Sounds terrifying, I'm sorry."</p><p>"Not your fault," Agatha sighed and dropped her hand to cover Rio's. </p><p>"Hmm," Rio agreed. "I'll talk to my dream self and tell her to step it up."</p><p>Agatha snorted, their hands jumping as her stomach moved, "Sorry for waking you up."</p><p>"It's okay," Rio whispered. "Think you can go back to sleep?"</p><p>"Eventually," Agatha draped her other arm over her eyes. Truthfully the dream felt so visceral that even though she couldn't remember the specific details, Agatha would be awake with the resounding feelings for at least a few hours.</p><p>Rio thought in silence for a few moments then slid out of bed and went downstairs. </p><p>Agatha frowned, wondering what Rio was up to. She heard movement and a rushing sound and figured Rio had gone to use the bathroom but when the alpha reappeared she held out a hand to Agatha who sat up and took it curiously, following Rio down the stairs and to the bathroom where the tap was running in the large tub.</p><p>The soap smelled like Rio's body wash and Agatha felt some of the tension leave her neck and shoulders as Rio turned off the water and tested the temperature.</p><p>Rio folded a towel and left a robe on the sink and kissed Agatha's cheek, turning to leave when Agatha reached out for Rio's hand and stopped her.</p><p>"Stay," she asked.</p><p>Agatha didn't want to be alone. Now that she had Rio she found herself craving her presence, needing the alpha near lest her omega started complaining. </p><p>Rio looked like a deer in headlights, a flush colored her cheeks and she swallowed deeply. </p><p>A small flutter tickled Agatha's stomach, proud and flattered she could stop the alpha in her tracks with a single request. </p><p>"You don't have to look," Agatha demurred. "But I'd like your company.</p><p>Rio's throat bobbed a few times and her scent grew heavy like whiskey aged wood, smooth and intoxicating. </p><p>"The problem is I <em>want</em> to look," Rio's pupils expanded and contracted in rapid succession as she tried to control her alpha's urges. </p><p>Goosebumps erupted over Agatha's skin and a thrill traveled up her spine that made her heart race and gave her the courage to say what she wanted.</p><p>"Then look," Agatha's grin grew slowly as she stepped back and hooked her thumbs in the top of her shorts, dragging them down over her black underwear and letting them fall and pool around her ankles.</p><p>Rio's lips were parted and Agatha had her undivided attention, hands curling and flexing at her sides. </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms and grasped the hem of her shirt and pulled it over her head, shaking out her hair as it flowed over her shoulders. </p><p>"Fuck," Rio cursed under her breath. Her eyes greedily took in the sight of Agatha standing mostly nude in front of her like her own personal Venus. </p><p>Rio's eyes dragged over the curve of her thighs and hips and traveled up her stomach and landed on her breasts, pink nipples tightened under her gaze and Rio's eyes jumped to Agatha's heavy-lidded stare</p><p>The alpha licked her lips and Agatha hooked her thumbs in her underwear, moving at a deliberately slow pace until the fabric joined her shorts on the floor and she stood bare in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio's eyes darted up and down, the muscles in her jaw moved under her skin as she clenched her molars together and her nostrils flared. Rio's scent grew stronger and Agatha pressed her legs together in reaction, Rio catching the movement as she choked on a groan. </p><p>"Get in the tub, Agatha," Rio spoke, her voice rang with desperation under the thread of command and Agatha moved without thinking, balancing carefully as she stepped into the tub and sunk down below the surface of the warm water. </p><p>Rio blew out a breath and shook her head fondly as she grabbed a foot stool to sit next to Agatha and gathered her wavy hair over the edge of the tub. </p><p>"What made you think of a bath?" Agatha asked, the sound of water lapping joined her voice as it echoed off the tiles.</p><p>Rio shrugged and folded her arms along the edge of the tub and rested her chin on her stacked hands, "Therapist recommended it to help regulate myself when I'm overwhelmed. Figured it couldn't hurt."</p><p>Agatha hummed, "I used to do spa weekends every so often just to get away from work and Ralph."</p><p>"I bet it was fancy with fruit in the water, amniotic facials, IV therapy, CBD massages..."</p><p>"And?" Agatha raised an eyebrow, "Besides, Ralph paid for it, so of course I was going to get the best."</p><p>Rio smirked, "Are you saying you're high maintenance?"</p><p>"I'm saying," Agatha stared at Rio, "I know a good opportunity when I see it."</p><p>Rio smiled and dipped her fingers in the water, swirling it around idly and poking at the bubbles that floated by. Little by little, Rio's fingers got closer until they brushed against Agatha's wet knee.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio's fingers, neither woman said anything but both were hyper focused on the touch. Every so often Rio got bolder, her pointer finger traced over Agatha's knee and further up her thigh, right up to where Agatha's leg disappeared under water and back again in a lazy back and forth pattern. </p><p>They were playing with fire; Rio was pushing against the perimeter of her self-control, bending the rules to indulge just a little bit more, promising she'll stop after a moment, until a moment turned into two, then three...</p><p>Rio paused when her fingers dipped below the water and Agatha saw the conflict play out on the alpha's face, watching the devil and angel on each shoulder argue in real time. </p><p>Agatha had always been biased.</p><p>She was evil after all.</p><p>Agatha relaxed and let her knees fall open.</p><p>She heard the quick intake of breath and stared into Rio's eyes as she felt them resting heavily on her while the alpha decided what to do. </p><p>A long moment passed and Rio pulled her hand away as Agatha tried to mask her disappointment, preparing to end the bath.</p><p>Instead, Rio pushed the stool away and knelt on the rug, returning her cooled fingers to the inside of Agatha's thigh while Rio's other hand circled the back of Agatha's neck, cradling her head as Rio leaned down to kiss her soundly. </p><p>Agatha sighed against Rio's lips and lifted her hands to frame Rio's face as water dripped down her neck and soaked into her tank top.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Rio breathed when they broke apart and Agatha nodded, her omega drunk on desire and the need to be closer. </p><p>"Touch me," Agatha murmured against Rio's lips.</p><p>A pleased growl rumbled in Rio's throat while her hand disappeared under water and crept closer to the apex of Agatha's thighs, making the omega jump when Rio's fingers ghosted the edge of her cunt. </p><p>Agatha gasped and her hips jerked, making the water surface choppy as Rio grinned and claimed her mouth again, setting a languid, exploratory pace that Rio mimicked with her fingers.</p><p>Rio parted her slowly and Agatha nearly keened at the touch, letting Rio swallow her sounds while her legs twitched.</p><p>"Fuck, you feel perfect," Rio groaned like it pained her and slid her fingers against Agatha's warmth as the omega whimpered and wrapped her arms around Rio's neck.</p><p>Agatha's hips rocked of their own accord and Rio pulled her hand away, making Agatha complain with a frustrated grunt. </p><p>"Stay still for me," Rio turned her head so she could nip at Agatha's ear. "I want to feel you."</p><p>Agatha whined but obeyed, her body tensing and shuddering every time Rio neared her clit. Using her thumb, Rio pressed down on her labia, rubbing up one side and down the other, repeating the pattern as she worked her way inward and pressed her thumb against her entrance. </p><p>The omega in Agatha howled with need as her legs trembled. </p><p>"Rio," she begged, tugging at the alpha's shirt.</p><p>Rio's answering moan reverberated through Agatha's body, sparking a fresh wave of desire that made Agatha clench around nothing, desperate to draw the alpha inside.</p><p>Lazy fingers circled her clit and Agatha sucked in a breath through her teeth as her toes curled and her breathing sped up.</p><p>"Look at me," Rio breathed, watching as Agatha's eyes opened, her pupils blown and unfocused and full of desire. </p><p>Rio gently pushed a finger against Agatha's entrance and hummed in satisfaction when the omega's walls gave, punctuated with a soft high-pitched cry as Agatha's mouth fell open and her eyes slipped shut again.</p><p>"Beautiful," Rio purred and crooked her finger, searching and rubbing against Agatha's inner walls while her thumb circled her clit, building her gradually toward orgasm. </p><p>When Agatha grew slick, Rio added a second finger, stretching her as her cunt tightened.</p><p>"Oh my god," Agatha gasped, her chest rising and falling out of the water with labored breath as the water sloshed against the sides of the tub, splashing and soaking the front of Rio's tank top. The alpha paid no mind to it, fully enamored by the feel of Agatha's cunt wrapped around her fingers, wishing it was her cock instead. </p><p>She kept her movements consistent, curling her fingers inside Agatha over and over while her thumb pressed harder against her clit, drawing tighter circles when Agatha's legs began to shake. </p><p>Rio kissed the side of Agatha's face, murmuring just loud enough that Agatha could hear. </p><p>"Come for me."</p><p>Rio's voice, laden with tender arousal, was enough for the wave of Agatha's climax to wash her away; tremors shook her legs and her cunt fluttered around Rio's fingers as Agatha continued to whimper, snapping her legs shut when it got to be too much. </p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip as little aftershocks seized her, breathing heavily through her nose as Rio turned her head to kiss Agatha slowly, soothing her tortured lip.</p><p>The water had become lukewarm and Agatha was ready to get out, her body felt pleasantly heavy, her omega punch-drunk and happy. </p><p>"Out?" Agatha murmured, nuzzling her nose against Rio's cheek. </p><p>Rio carefully removed her fingers, wincing when Agatha hissed and rubbed her leg in apology. Agatha pushed herself up and took Rio's hand to balance herself as she stepped out of the tub. </p><p>While Agatha dried off and wrapped the robe around her body, Rio pulled the plug and drained the water, quickly rinsing away the soap. When she turned around, Agatha's eyes were drawn to the tight front of Rio's pants and she felt bad for neglecting the alpha; supposedly leaving her unfulfilled could hurt- or so she had been told. </p><p>Agatha stepped closer to Rio, pressing her body against the alpha as she rested a hand on her hip. </p><p>"I can..." Agatha looked down and traced the top of Rio's pants with her thumb.</p><p>Rio pressed her forehead against Agatha's, "No it's okay."</p><p>Agatha pulled her head back and furrowed her brow, "Are you sure?"</p><p>Rio nodded and rubbed her hands over Agatha's arms, "You're sleepy again, I can tell."</p><p>Agatha scrunched her nose. She was tired but she wasn't sure if Rio was simply being nice or not. "Doesn't it...won't it...hurt?"</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha for a second before bursting into laughter as the omega glared and pouted, not happy about being seemingly mocked.</p><p>"Sorry," Rio stamped down her giggles, "No, it won't hurt. Did someone tell you that?"</p><p>"What do you think?" Agatha huffed and crossed her arms over her chest. </p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio replied sincerely and wrapped her arms around Agatha. "I'm not making fun of you, I promise. Whoever told you that is a creep."</p><p>Rio kissed her cheek, "It's mildly annoying but as soon as I think of something unattractive I'll be fine."</p><p>"Although," Rio kissed her other cheek, "That's going to be impossible with you right in front of me."</p><p>Agatha's reluctant smile grew wicked and her eyes glinted with mischief, "I could talk about Ralph."</p><p>Rio groaned with disgust, "And somehow you've achieved the impossible."</p><p>Agatha chuckled and Rio's gaze softened, "I'll be fine, I promise."</p><p>Agatha made a face and Rio laughed quietly.</p><p>"Let me take care of you."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha turns over again and Rio shifts and lays her head on Agatha's chest. </p><p>"I can hear you thinking," Rio murmurs, her voice laden with sleep.</p><p>Agatha hums and presses her lips to the top of Rio's head.</p><p>"Regrets?" Rio whispers. </p><p>She doesn't move from her spot and Agatha can sense her tension behind closed eyelids. </p><p>"No," Agatha answers firmly.</p><p>Rio relaxes against her and dozes lightly, fighting to stay awake and keep Agatha company. </p><p>Agatha's heart swells and she settles, pressing her nose to Rio's hair and inhaling deeply and letting the alpha's scent lull her back to sleep.</p><p>She's exactly where she wants to be. </p><p> </p>

<p>Alice arrives the next morning before Agatha wakes. When Agatha heads downstairs, she and Rio are sitting around the dining room table, Alice acknowledging Agatha and lifting her cup of coffee with a nod. </p><p>Rio smiles at her and tells her to go ahead and join them whenever she's ready and they can update her about what's going on. </p><p>Agatha grunts sleepily, still squinting against the morning light, her hair a messy auburn nest, and walks past the two of them to the bathroom. </p><p>While she's in there, Rio gets up and makes Agatha's coffee, leaving it in front of the empty chair while Alice tries to stifle her grin. </p><p>"I've never seen you so...domestic," Alice whispers when Rio sits back in her seat, crossing her legs and picking up her mug.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, "I get you coffee too," she points out, eyeing the bathroom door.</p><p>"Yeah, but you don't put any lov-"</p><p>"If you finish that sentence I will jump across the table and stab you with a fork," Rio turns red instantly, her fingers clutching her mug tightly, fingertips turning white while her heart hammers in her chest. </p><p>Alice literally giggles and Rio deflates miserably, her alpha put out by the reaction. She's a big scary, predator for fuck's sake; first Agatha challenges her then Alice laughs at her, maybe she is losing her edge. </p><p>"Oh come on, you look like I kicked your puppy," Alice prods while Rio pouts. </p><p>"Okay, okay," Alice relents, "I get it, too soon for the "L" word."</p><p>Rio huffs. That's an understatement. </p><p>"But it's cute," Alice grins just as the bathroom door opens and Agatha joins them at the table, more awake but still non-verbal without her coffee. </p><p>"Thanks," Agatha mumbles after the first sip and Alice side eyes Rio who still looks a little pink.</p><p>"No problem," Rio mumbles back, moving on to the main topic of conversation to avoid the awkwardness that lingers around her. </p><p>"Kelly Monreau, found at 7:15pm. Accidentally overdosed on painkillers prescribed by her doctor for body aches and migraines," Rio runs through the main details of the new case.</p><p>"Filed for divorce from Paul Monreau six weeks ago, Paul reported erratic behavior and mental health issues during their mediations and claims it could be a possible factor in her death."</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes over the edge of her mug; immediately suspicious of anything Paul says. In her emails the omega seemed coherent and of sound mind if not naive but Agatha hadn't interacted with the omega enough to make a confident statement on her mental health.</p><p>"Brenda Moore," Alice takes over the next part.</p><p>"Last seen walking her dog in the evening around seven thirty, found around eight by another dog walker near an overpass. Passer by called an ambulance but she hasn't regained consciousness since."</p><p>"Speculation is she jumped," Alice continues. "She was separated from her husband who also reported erratic behavior and deteriorating mental health in their most recent interactions."</p><p>"Brenda wasn't suicidal," Agatha finally speaks. </p><p>"She planned to enter into a lawsuit against Versa with the drug trial evidence. I have emails with her as late as last week, she sounds lucid, like her normal self."</p><p>Agatha is more confident making a statement about Brenda, having known her for years longer than Kelly through forced interaction. </p><p>"Not to mention who takes their dog with them if they plan to jump?" Rio points out and Alice nods in agreement.</p><p>"CSI is processing evidence and as of now, you and Brenda are under protective custody. There are too many coincidences for this to be an accident we just need to find solid evidence for a lead."</p><p>"Just because we're divorcing our husbands?" Agatha asks bitterly. "Seems extreme."</p><p>Rio nods, "It is."</p><p>"What are you thinking?" Alice asks.</p><p>"Sloppy execution, questionable motivations, timing...it's either a cover up or a distraction," Rio taps her finger against her mug. </p><p>"We already know about the drug trials, what else could we be involved in?" Agatha asks. "I'm not sure about the others but Ralph told me jack shit about anything to do with Versa. I can testify about the drug trials but that's it."</p><p>"Could be a motive," Alice offers. "If they can keep you from testifying our case is weakened."</p><p>"We still have other evidence and whistleblowers," Rio points out, "The drug trials are just a part of it."</p><p>"I assume all three men have alibis for last night," Agatha asks with a raise of her eyebrow. </p><p>Alice confirms with a nod.</p><p>It's too early for a headache. Agatha sighs. </p><p>Rio's fingers twitch like she wants to reach out but Alice is there and though Rio feels safe enough to tell Alice about their...whatever it is...it's a different thing to be open and affectionate when things are still new to the both of them.</p><p>Alice seems to get the hint and stands up slowly, stretching and cracking her neck. "I'm gonna head to the lab, see if any leads have come up. I'll call you when I know more," she nods at Rio.</p><p>"Thanks," she replies while Agatha offers a terse smile.</p><p>The other alpha departs, leaving them alone again to stew on spoon fed information, physically and mentally stuck in place and unable to do anything meaningful from afar.</p><p>Agatha rubs her temples and Rio watches with concern, "Headache?"</p><p>"Not yet but close," Agatha admits easily. Rio appreciates the new level of trust. </p><p>"Take a break," Rio suggests, "We're not going to get anything done like this. A distraction might be better."</p><p>"Suggestions?" Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio flushes a pretty pink that makes Agatha smile. There's something to be said about being desired, even when she's cranky. Agatha knows she shouldn't compare her last relationship to this one but she can't help but wonder if she ever felt wanted like this. </p><p>Ralph would get annoyed if she were tired or snippy, telling her to come back when she was in a better mood and ready to talk like a normal person. Her attitude wasn't his problem, he said once to her, and it stuck with her ever since. </p><p>Rio clears her throat, "There's that dating show with same sex mates, they trade partners over a month to see if they really want to be mated or if they break up."</p><p>"Sounds awful," Agatha replies. "Where's the remote?"</p><p>Rio chuckles and refills their coffee, bringing it to the living area and searching out the remote in a coffe table drawer while Agatha settles with a blanket, falling easily into familiar routine. </p><p>Rio presses play and Agatha settles against her, molding her body to Rio's as the alpha wraps her arm around Agatha. </p><p>The opening starts and both women focus on the screen. </p><p>Couples are introduced and the mingling begins as women start to pair up with their potential new "mates" and jealousy is immediate which of course makes for good trashy television. </p><p>Rio pulls a face at one of the contestants, "She reminds me of my ex."</p><p>"How so?" Agatha asks curiously. </p><p>"Flirtatous, life of the party, moves quickly from one person to another," Rio shrugs. "Not a bad thing, most times her flirting was harmless so I never thought anything of it. Last I heard she has a new girlfriend, a rock climber."</p><p>"You still talk to her? Agatha raises an eyebrow. </p><p>Rio shakes her head, "No, I'm a little too hurt for that but the gay community is pretty small so it's kind of hard to not hear things."</p><p>Agatha's curiosity is piqued, "When did you know you were..." </p><p>Agatha hesitates, realizing she has no idea how Rio wants to be referenced and not wanting to offend the alpha. Luckily, Rio interjects and saves her. </p><p>"Gay?" Rio grins and Agatha nods. </p><p>"Is that what you prefer to be called?"</p><p>"Gay, lesbian," Rio shrugs, "Doesn't matter too much to me."</p><p>Rio tilts her head, "Actually, now that I think about it, what do <em>you</em> refer to yourself as?"</p><p>"Answer my question first," Agatha counters and Rio takes a moment to think, stretching and inhaling through her teeth.</p><p>"I think maybe five?" Rio guesses. "I was in kindergarten and I <em>really</em> wanted my sleeping mat to be next to Jessica Sherman every time."</p><p>Agatha grins imagining a five year old Rio throwing a tantrum because she can't be near her favorite person.</p><p>"I also told my mom I wanted to marry Belle from Beauty and the Beast so..." Rio chuckles. </p><p>"She's boring," Agatha teases while Rio scoffs. </p><p>"I've always liked the Little Mermaid more, she had spunk and decided what she wanted and went for it, despite what everyone said."</p><p>"Yeah, no idea why you'd connect with her," Rio deadpans though her eyes shine with mirth. </p><p>Agatha flips her off. </p><p>"So what do you refer to yourself as?" Rio nudges Agatha, wrapping an arm around her waist. </p><p>"Honestly, I'm not sure," Agatha gives it the first serious thought since maybe college. She had done the 'make out with girls when drunk' thing which she enjoyed but Ralph had happened so early that she never really questioned it after that. </p><p>"Does that bother you?" Agatha asks.</p><p>"Hm, I don't think so, I mean...you're here," Rio points out, squeezing lightly.</p><p>"I do like you I suppose," Agatha smiles. </p><p>On screen one of the contestants is backed by dramatic music as she cries, "I can't do this anymore."</p><p>It's heard in the back of Agatha's mind; she's not even paying full attention to the television but something registers and suddenly Agatha is in a bright room, she feels like she's surfacing from underwater. </p><p>
<em>"I can't do this anymore," she pleads, turning her head to the woman next to her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"She's awake," the woman talks to someone else across Agatha's body.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I want to go home," Agatha whines.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Shhh, go back to sleep," A deeper voice coos and Agatha attempts to shake her head, only succeeding in turning her head the other way weakly. </em>
</p><p>
<em>She catches her reflection in a window. It's her but not her, like she's outside of her body looking at lifeless eyes and a blank expression; trapped in a wooden puppet with no idea who had the strings.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I want to go home," Agatha repeats.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Agatha..."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I want to go home!" She insists. She doesn't even know where home is, she just wants to leave this place.</em>
</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>"I want to go home!" Agatha lashes out, feeling cornered and having no choice but to fight her way out. </p><p>She starts flailing but her wrists are caught and her arms are held down and she fights harder, screaming and thrashing desperately; she can't be trapped here again, she doesn't want to any more.</p><p>"Agatha! Agatha, stop, it's me!" Rio shouts to be heard, holding Agatha in a bear hug. </p><p>Agatha's distress clashes with Rio's scent as it fights to get through to the omega, her heart beating rapidly against her ribcage.</p><p>"It's me," Rio repeats, watching Agatha's eyes come back into focus as she slumps, the fight leaving her as she regains her bearings. </p><p>"Let me go," she croaks and Rio releases her immediately, sitting up and giving Agatha some space. </p><p>Agatha gulps in large breaths and realizes she's on the floor. The show still plays in the background and the blanket is tangled half on the couch and half on the floor. </p><p>She sits up, feeling like she's taken a hit from a joint; floaty and detached from her body. Everything sounds like it's far away at the other end of a tunnel and her throat hurts. For a second she looks at Rio like she's a stranger but little by little, recognition filters into Agatha's eyes.</p><p>Strangely, her omega is silent, worryingly so until Agatha takes a deep breath and Rio's scent penetrates her haze, stirring her familiar instincts into awareness. </p><p>"What happened?" Agatha feels like her mind is returning faster than her control over her body and she forces herself to slow down before she panics. </p><p>"I-I have no idea," Rio falters, trying to calm herself down as her mind races, not sure what to do to help. </p><p>"We were talking and then you said you wanted to go home and I think maybe I was holding on to you and it didn't help. I didn't want you to hurt yourself, I'm sorry," Rio's voice trembles and Agatha shakes her head. </p><p>"You did the right thing," Agatha replies, her body feels relatively back to normal if not wrung out and exhausted. </p><p>"I don't know what happened. It felt like a dream, I know it wasn't real but it felt real."</p><p>"What wasn't real?" Rio asks gently. </p><p>"It felt like I was in a hospital. People surrounded my bed, they could hear me but they ignored me. They wanted me to go to sleep and I wanted to go home," Agatha buries her hands in her hair, rubbing aggressively at her scalp to temper the throbbing in her skull.</p><p>Rio stands and offers a hand to Agatha to help her stand and sit back on the couch while Rio tucks the blanket around her shoulders. </p><p>"Water?" Rio asks and Agatha nods, laying down along the length of the couch, sitting up halfway when Rio returns with a glass and taking a few sips to soothe her aching throat.</p><p>Rio takes the glass and puts it on the coffee table, taking a seat on the shorter section of the L-shaped couch so she can stretch her legs and sit near Agatha, wary of triggering anything else now that Agatha is calm. </p><p>"You had a nightmare last night too," Rio observes mostly to herself. </p><p>"I've never had this reaction to stress before," Agatha murmurs.</p><p>"It's not just stress," Rio says carefully, "It's trauma."</p><p>Agatha frowns and pulls the blanket tighter. Logically she knows Rio is right but deep conditioning and her primitive brain want to reject the idea, counting on her resilience to power through and continue living her life as she has. </p><p>"I'm tired," Agatha says instead. Rio lets it go for now and takes one of the throw pillows and puts it under Agatha's head. </p><p>"Can I call Jen later?" Agatha asks on a yawn. She's not sure what the rules are for protective custody and should probably ask. She makes a mental note to herself to discuss it with Rio later. </p><p>"Yeah, I should probably have William encrypt your phone and your computer anyway," Rio hums.</p><p>Agatha sighs, "And I should email Lilia and let her know."</p><p>Rio presses her lips together in sympathy, "I'll do it while you're napping."</p><p>Rio runs her fingers through Agatha's hair, pushing it away from her face while the omega blinks slowly. </p><p>"Can you stay until I fall asleep?" Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio's scent acts like a balm and Agatha is pretty sure the alpha isn't aware that her scent shifts; forest oak morphs to willow and pine and the smell of moss; healing and soothing as Rio settles and crosses her legs, content to stand guard while Agatha rests. </p><p>"Yeah, I'm here."</p><p>-------------</p><p>By some kind of grace from the universe, Agatha doesn't dream. </p><p>When she wakes, the light of day has changed, brighter and more golden than the slow creep of morning and the room feels warmer. </p><p>As she sits up the blanket falls and though she's groggy her headache is no longer pounding. </p><p>She can smell Rio so she knows she's around but the alpha is currently out of sight. Agatha makes her way to the bathroom and then the kitchen when her stomach rumbles and finds her phone and her computer on the dining room table. </p><p>Agatha makes herself a sandwich and retrieves her phone, finding a text from Rio telling her the phone and computer are good to go and she's outside if she needs her, securing the area and getting a feel for any weak spots around the house. </p><p>Her first call is to Jen who is irate and suspicious on her behalf once Agatha explains and immediately latches on to the fact that Agatha is alone with Rio in a cabin though, to her credit, Jen does manage to focus on the threat to Agatha's actual life. </p><p><em>"I'm <strong>trying</strong> to be positive,"</em> Jen scoffs and Agatha can hear the implied 'duh' in her voice.</p><p>"I wanted to let you know to be careful, too," Agatha warns. "I know Ralph went to see you after I left, I wouldn't put it past him to try again."</p><p>Jen hums, <em>"I'll let the roommates know."</em></p><p>There's a loaded pause between them and Agatha wonders what benefit Jen could possibly reap from being her friend, so far it's been nothing but burden for the other omega. </p><p><em>"Be safe,"</em> Jen mutters and Agatha snorts.</p><p>"I have a big strong FBI agent remember?"</p><p><em>"Atta girl,"</em> Jen shoots back.</p><p>The two women say their goodbyes and Agatha makes her next call to Lilia, updating her as succinctly and robotically as possible. She needs to prove she can still do her job, rejecting the leave Lilia offers and insists she can maintain her remote work.</p><p>Lilia agrees as long as Agatha updates her on her cases and asks about the gun license and handling classes which Agatha assures her came in handy and the older woman says she'll look into expediting Agatha's paperwork.</p><p>As soon as she's off the phone, Agatha sighs and tosses the device onto the table, already tired of the constant change, wishing she could remember what it's like to have a normal life. </p><p>What would it be like to date Rio if everything around them weren't a whirlwind of chaos? </p><p>Agatha chuckles to herself, imaging Rio bringing her plants and pressed flowers. Dinners at restaurants and bars; Agatha would probably cook for her at some point, just to impress her, or if she were planning on staying over...</p><p>She wanders upstairs to fetch her bag and do some work to keep her mind occupied, bringing her things downstairs to work at the dining room table. Briefly she wonders if there's a deck of cards stashed somewhere, predicting boredom will become an issue at some point once she runs out of work and television to watch. </p><p>Maybe she can plan a date for Rio.</p><p>Agatha blushes at the thought and puts it on her mental to do list, she can use the opportunity to say thank you at the very least. </p><p>Her blush deepens as Agatha thinks of multiple ways to say 'thank you' and Agatha chides herself for acting like a teenager with a crush, shushing her omega as her thoughts fixate, recalling the previous night with perfect clarity as phantom sensations ghost over her body. </p><p>Agatha exhales roughly through her nose, she's not going to let herself get distracted. </p><p>She logs on to her work terminal and forces herself to concentrate. </p><p>Agatha is about fifteen minutes into a good work flow when Rio returns through the front door, shirt tucked into her back pocket leaving the alpha in a sports bra and a pair of loose joggers that sit low on her hips, exposing the top of her briefs. </p><p>Her dark hair is up in a high messy pony tail and pieces fall and stick to her sweaty forehead and neck. Rio's face lights up when she sees Agatha and the omega squeezes her legs together, hoping her heart-eyes aren't obvious.</p><p>"Hey, feel better?" Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha stares at her computer screen, pretending to be immersed in what she's reviewing though she's not absorbing anything, "Yeah, the nap helped. How was outside?"</p><p>Rio grabs water from the fridge and Agatha can't help but side eye the alpha's profile as she lifts the bottle to her lips and takes a few long pulls. </p><p>Agatha bites her bottom lip and tears her eyes away, scrolling down a bit on her screen to make it seem she's actually making progress. </p><p>"All good, seems like we're in a pretty secure place. There's even video surveillance and perimeter warnings," Rio answers, recapping her water. </p><p>Agatha hums in acknowledgement as she imagines a drop of sweat falling over Rio's stomach, heat creeping down her neck. </p><p>"I'm gonna shower," Rio announces and again Agatha hums.</p><p>There's a pause behind her which Agatha wouldn't have noticed if she weren't so attuned to the alpha's movement. Rio shuffles around and puts her water bottle in the fridge, rounding the small island and passing behind Agatha. </p><p>"I'll be thinking about you," Rio murmurs, a smirk firmly planted on her lips, remembering the scent of Agatha's arousal that gives her away no matter how indifferent her outer expression seems. </p><p>Agatha sits up straight as Rio calls her out and glares at the alpha, "Tease."</p><p>"You like it," Rio laughs over her shoulder as the bathroom door closes and Agatha grumbles under her breath. </p><p>Because she does like it. </p><p>Agatha smiles fondly and does actually try to concentrate, her focus returning now that her main distraction is out of sight. </p><p>She opens her computer bag to retrieve her hard drive and spots the second hard drive that she forgot about, taking it out curiously and inspecting it. </p><p>There's an SD card in the slot and Agatha plugs the hard drive in to her computer, opening it once her computer recognizes the device. </p><p>It's likely she either forgot about this hard drive and kept it as a spare or it's possible Ralph left his crap laying around so she picked it up. </p><p>Typical, Agatha rolls her eyes, clicking on a folder and watching it expand with a list of text documents, all starting with <em>subject_13A</em> with numbers following which Agatha assumes are dates judging by the format. </p><p>Dread begins to pool in her stomach and something in her mind warns her not to press forward, picturing the dark black abyss that sits in her mind, growing and pulsing menacingly as it calls to her.</p><p>A second folder sits at the bottom of the text files labeled as mp4 and Agatha opens it, finding video files named in a similar way and double clicks on one.</p><p>She feels like she's standing on the edge of the precipice, hovering over the dark abyss as she tilts forward and free falls. </p><p>A video feed opens and it takes a second for Agatha to realize she's looking at herself. </p><p>The camera seems like it's set up on a stationary tripod, viewing most of the area from a corner of the room. </p><p>Agatha, the video version of herself, is in a reclined and padded chair, expression vacant and eyes glassy as a nurse adjusts her IV and updates her vitals. </p><p>A voice near the camera speaks, one Agatha doesn't recognize.</p><p>
<em>"Increased dosage, subject is especially resistant, showing signs of distress and dissociation, with periods of lucidity when emotionally triggered."</em>
</p><p>Agatha stares at her supine form, scraping her memory for any recollection, recalling only her nightmares and the brief flash she had earlier in the day. </p><p>But she doesn't remember this.</p><p>The only thing she does in the video is breathe; her chest moves up and down and the heart monitor beeps in steady rhythm. A figure in scrubs steps into frame and on screen Agatha turns her head toward it, recognizing the shoes and posture as Ralph.</p><p>The heart monitor picks up and she can hear herself mumbling, realizing her legs and arms are restrained by padded straps when she starts to move. </p><p>Ralph speaks to the nurse who appears and injects something into her IV line while Ralph holds her hand.</p><p>Some how seeing that is the most infuriating part about the video. Agatha trusted him, how dare he attempt to comfort her as he pulls off the ultimate deception. </p><p>Agatha exits out of the video and scans the file names, noting the dates go back to right before Ralph's promotion.</p><p>She had been his project. </p><p>The bathroom door opens and Agatha's ear perks but she doesn't turn away from her screen.</p><p>Rio comes out smiling, expecting to continue their teasing but as she inhales, Rio's expression shifts to one of concern and a bit of anger; her alpha already on guard for what has made Agatha smell so bitter. </p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio rubs a towel through her damp hair and tosses it over her shoulder as she rounds the table to pull a chair next to Agatha's. </p><p>"It's me," Agatha replies, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. </p><p>Rio furrows her brow and Agatha turns her computer to Rio, silently telling her to look for herself. </p><p>The alpha scrolls, her honey brown eyes reflecting the bright light of the screen as she puts together the same information Agatha had just minutes before.</p><p>Rio clicks on a video and another voice talks, one Agatha recognizes. </p><p>Paul. </p><p>
<em>"She's perfectly unaware, obedient, and dependent. We've managed to create a formula that works on even the most resistant of omegas. If it works on her, it'll work on anyone."</em>
</p><p><em>"What stops her from talking?"</em> Another deep voice asks. Agatha doesn't recognize who it is but she assumes it's a client based on Paul's slick salesman pitch.</p><p>
<em>"She won't remember. Part of our research includes memory suppression. She'll have no idea once the drug wears off."</em>
</p><p>Rio pauses the video. </p><p>"You're having flashbacks," she says after a pause. </p><p>"Do you remember any of this?" Rio turns to Agatha who stares at the computer as if it will bite her. </p><p>"No," Agatha whispers. </p><p>Rio understands what Agatha means now. "It's you," she repeats. </p><p>"You, and probably the other mates, were the prototypes."</p><p>Agatha bites on her thumbnail, wrapping her arm around her middle, "The dates start around the same time Ralph started to go for his promotion."</p><p>"There's at least twenty videos here," Rio scrolls and Agatha shuts her eyes briefly.</p><p>"I bet money there's a file somewhere with Kelly and Brenda's videos," Agatha says quietly.</p><p>"Versa didn't just distribute, they developed the drug," Rio murmurs, her brain connecting threads at a rapid pace. </p><p>"Kelly, Brenda," Rio swallows and slowly turns to Agatha. "You're the only person capable of testifying against them. If we have this, the case is won."</p><p>"I can't testify if I don't remember," Agatha points out.</p><p>"There has to be a way to recover those memories," Rio tucks her hair behind her ears.</p><p>Agatha isn't sure she wants to. She knows the importance of it toward the case but she's lost time, days of her life that she apparently can't remember. How had Ralph been able to justify her being gone for days? </p><p>Agatha takes her computer back and checks the dates on the videos and pulls up her personal calendar, trying to see if anything around those dates might trigger a memory. </p><p>Rio watches, catching on quickly.</p><p>Every date coincides with a weekend away. </p><p>The spa trips Ralph so willingly paid for were covers for testing.</p><p>Agatha tries to remember her spa trips, recalling only afterward when she felt rested, if not a little sore. She can't remember what treatments she got, just a vague fog of feeling like she did go somewhere and something was done.</p><p>Rio looks from the calendar to Agatha. </p><p>"You could do it. You have the power to bring them all down."</p><p>Agatha fumes, put in a precarious position by decisions outside her own but now handed a choice; the power consolidating in her hand like a sword aimed right at Versa's neck. </p><p>And Agatha wants blood. </p><p>"How would we get my memory back?" She asks Rio before she loses her nerve. </p><p>If Agatha is going to be brave, she needs to do it now before she second guesses herself and their window of opportunity passes. </p><p>"I'll make some calls, let them know what's going on and see if we can get you to a specialist," Rio jumps into action, standing to retrieve her phone and making a series of calls while she paces the length of the living area. </p><p>In the meantime, Agatha opens her notes app on her phone and starts a log of memories and bits and pieces she can pull from her nightmares and her flashback, knowing a physical log will be more effective toward evidence. </p><p>She debates whether to watch the rest of the videos. It hurts to see herself and not remember anything but she knows if she watches there's a chance she might remember more. </p><p>Rio is deep in conversation and it doesn't seem to be ending soon. </p><p>With slow determination, Agatha clicks on the earliest video and starts to watch.</p><p>Her resistance is higher in the beginning as the tests are logged and her behaviors are recorded before and after each dose. </p><p>Sometimes she recognizes Paul and Ralph's voices; rarely does George talk and Agatha wonders if he's conscious that he's being recorded, either smarter or more paranoid than the others. </p><p>The last company partner, Ron Davis, married to Elizabeth, doesn't talk at all. His voice and his person never appear on camera and Agatha wonders if he's been excluded or if he's the one pulling the strings.</p><p>Ralph describes her behavior pre-trial as if listing symptoms of a sickness. </p><p>
<em>Defiant, oppositional, confrontational, no observed maternal behavior, aloof, moody, and over-critical.</em>
</p><p>Each word is like a needle under her skin and Agatha covers her inner elbow, rubbing at the phantom IV that pokes her vein. </p><p>
<em>Subject shows exceptional resistance to lower doses. Though instances of confrontation have lessened, instances of defiance and observed mood swings remain constant. </em>
</p><p>Agatha is proud of her past self, finding it easier to imagine the woman on screen as someone else since she has no solid mental or emotional connection to anything happening on screen. </p><p>She wants her to fight. Even though Agatha knows how it ends, she still wants the woman to push back and resist and refuse, making everything as difficult as possible if escape isn't an option. </p><p>An hour goes by before Rio rejoins Agatha at the table. The omega is only three videos in, taking notes on her phone as she goes. </p><p>Agatha pauses the video and sits up to face the alpha. </p><p>"Tomorrow Alice is going to pick us up and take us to the lab to run some tests and see what might be the best way to help you recover your memories," Rio tells her, leaning forward and resting her hand on the back of Agatha's chair.</p><p>"They're going to have to draw blood and do an MRI and CT scan," she warns Agatha. "Are you going to be okay with that?"</p><p>Agatha grinds her molars together; something about the question makes her resentment bubble to the surface, looking for an outlet. </p><p>Rio is the unfortunate target; the closest and safest option.</p><p>"Do I have a choice?" Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio is taken aback, snapping out of her professional persona, her features softening.</p><p>"You always do," Rio assures her. </p><p>"So if I refused to go you wouldn't try to convince me?" Agatha raises a challenging eyebrow.</p><p>Rio hesitates for a second too long, caught between honesty and comforting. </p><p>"That's what I thought," Agatha's voice shakes and tears well in her eyes. "I never asked for this."</p><p>"I know," Rio concedes.</p><p>"I never asked for the power to bring down a company. I don't want to be involved in anything!" Agatha's voice cracks and Rio stays silent, letting Agatha vent what she needs to. </p><p>"This isn't fair!" She shakes her head and tangles her fingers in her hair, fisting it until her scalp aches. </p><p>"Everything wrong with me made me a perfect subject. I didn't have to do anything," Agatha gasps when her tears spill over her lids. </p><p>"I'm tired of other people's decisions dictating my life," her tears collect at the tip of her nose and drip onto the table top. </p><p>Rio's spidery fingers prod at Agatha's, silently asking her to let go, wedging her fingertips under Agatha's knuckles until she finally relents and Rio doesn't hesitate, tugging firmly enough to pull Agatha into her lap, pressing their chests together as Rio encourages her to lean forward and mold her body to the alpha's.</p><p>Agatha slumps forward, wrapping an arm around the back of Rio's neck while her other arm clings to the back of Rio's shirt.</p><p>Rio rubs Agatha's back as she cries, cradling the omega in her arms until her sobs turn into hiccups, gasping every so often when her lungs spasm. Her shoulder is damp and uncomfortably warm but Rio ignores it, determined to sit there until Agatha is ready to move. </p><p>"I promise to make this as easy as possible," Rio whispers. "Anything you need I'll do it or I'll tell the doctors to do it."</p><p>Agatha knows she's not necessarily in a place to refuse; even if ultimately she <em>does</em> want to destroy all of them, it's still not her choice. She's just the final piece in a puzzle to be moved around and slotted into place.</p><p>"You'll be there the whole time?" Agatha asks cautiously.</p><p>"As long as you want me," Rio promises, trying not to add more weight to the sentiment than she means to.</p><p>"Okay," Agatha agrees reluctantly. </p><p>They sit there for a while until Agatha's hips hurt and Rio's legs lose circulation. </p><p>Agatha eases herself back until she can stand and Rio follows, wincing when her hip pops and stretches. </p><p>"What do you want to do?" Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha bites her bottom lip in contemplation then sits back down and brings the paused video back on screen. </p><p>"I need to finish this," she looks up at Rio, her eyes begging for approval or permission though she requires neither; simply wanting to be seen.</p><p>"I need to know."</p><p>Rio presses her lips together in a thin line and nods once, sitting back down and reaching for Agatha's hand and lacing their fingers together.</p><p>Agatha squeezes Rio's hand in silent gratitude and presses play.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha's blood is taken for the third time in four hours and true to her word, Rio is there for every one. </p><p>She's there for the MRI and the CT scan too, though she has to stay behind in the observation booth. </p><p>Agatha is given earbuds for the MRI and can hear Rio's voice giving her time updates in her ears, and when she starts getting bored Rio starts pretending she's an AM radio dj which she's promptly told to stop doing when Agatha laughs when she's supposed to be holding still.</p><p>They get lunch nearby while the results process and it's early afternoon by the time Agatha is escorted into an office, Rio with her by request, as they sit down with a rather meek looking doctor with round glasses and salt and pepper hair. </p><p>"Ms. Harkness, my name is Dr. Banner, I work in neuro and psychological studies for the FBI. I've been assigned to your rather unique case and want to assure you my team and I are doing everything we can to help you."</p><p>Agatha inhales deeply, beyond the sterile scent of disinfectant and hand sanitizer is a softer smell, like clean laundry. She identifies the doctor as an omega which helps her relax a little. </p><p>"So what's going on?" Agatha asks, eyeing the laptop the doctor carries. </p><p>He sits on the chair across from her, catching on quickly to the tone Agatha sets and getting straight to the point.</p><p>"Your CT scans came back normal but your MRIs and blood work are showing abnormalities in neurotransmitters and deterioration within your limbic system which is responsible for memory and emotion," Banner pauses to be sure Agatha understands what he's saying and Agatha nods for him to continue. </p><p>"There seems to be an absence of a supplemental blocker which based on previous evidence we now believe was the compound your mate-"</p><p>"Ex," Agatha growls and Banner ducks his head in apology. </p><p>"We think your ex-mate was supplementing the neuro-blockers in the tea he gave you," he finishes. </p><p>"So how does this connect to her getting her memory back now?" Rio asks, having been silent for most of the conversation.</p><p>Banner opens his laptop and pulls up the MRI scans of Agatha's brain. </p><p>"Your limbic system is already trying to rebuild itself which may be why you're experiencing flashes of memory. The brain is incredibly resilient and the neurotransmitters are coming back online, so to speak, and firing off all at once."</p><p>"So I just wait?" Agatha raises a brow.</p><p>"Normally I would say yes," Banner starts. "But we don't know what effects long term exposure might have on a person."</p><p>His voice lowers, growing solemn with the tone of bad news.</p><p>"It's possible that long term exposure would overload your limbic system as it rebuilds, leaving it paralyzed in a sense."</p><p>Agatha's stomach drops.</p><p>"What does that mean?" </p><p>Banner pushes his glasses up into his curly hair.</p><p>"If that happens or if the deterioration continues, it's possible you may lose part or all of your memories and the ability to make new ones."</p><p>The silence in the room is heavy as both women digest the news.</p><p>Agatha imagines losing herself to the abyss, not even connected to her omega instincts. Would she be aware? Would she be trapped in her mind or would she slowly lose gaps of herself until she has no clue who she is, unless she's told or piloted. </p><p>She would rather die. </p><p>Her hands shake and her voice fails her so Rio takes over.</p><p>"How do we fix this?" Rio's question is clear, there is no 'if' they find a solution, there has to be a fix for this. With all the resources of the FBI, there has to be a way.</p><p>"The good news," Banner keeps his voice even, not wanting to oversell the possibility of a cure. "Is that we have the drug and are in the process of reverse engineering it to create an antidote of sorts."</p><p>"But?" Rio prompts.</p><p>"But it will take time," Banner continues. "I can't guarantee there won't be permanent damage by the time we come up with a usable cure."</p><p>Banner leans forward to catch Agatha's eyes, "The last thing I wanted to ask is if we can have your consent to do a lumbar puncture. With a sample of cerebral spinal fluid from an affected person, it might help expedite our research."</p><p>His voice is soothing and compassionate and though Agatha stares back at him with guarded suspicion he doesn't look away. Banner's eyes shine with sincerity and a sort of steady understanding; years of skill and experience resulting in a quiet confidence that Agatha is inclined to trust. </p><p>"Only with your permission," he emphasizes. "I realize with the nature of your experience it could be uncomfortable."</p><p>"Would it be worth it? For your research?" Agatha asks.</p><p>Banner smiles kindly, "I appreciate you taking that into consideration but the question is whether it's worth it to you?</p><p>Agatha blinks and eyes his badge and lanyard for his credentials. </p><p>"Apologies," he notices where Agatha's eyes go but he isn't defensive. "I started as a licensed psychiatrist, sometimes it helps in the job."</p><p>Agatha rigidly studies him, mildly surprised at his honesty and decides to tentatively trust him. </p><p>"What do you mean if it's worth it to me?"</p><p>"If you believe the benefit to you doesn't outweigh the negative effects you may experience, you're allowed to say no," he explains.</p><p>"But it could help the research," Agatha points out. </p><p>"It could," Banner affirms.</p><p>"So shouldn't I do it?" Agatha scrunches her eyebrows. </p><p>"Only if it's your choice. Not because it benefits me or because you 'should' do it but because you have decided to," Banner concludes. His voice and gaze are steady which help ground Agatha as he tries to help her realize her agency. </p><p>Agatha side eyes Rio, wondering if she had mentioned anything to the doctor but Rio's face is a mask of quiet support, giving nothing away as she waits for Agatha to speak. </p><p>"Okay," she breathes. "But Rio stays."</p><p>Banner smiles, "You got it."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Once Agatha is changed into a hospital gown, she's lead down a sterile hallway with Rio at her side into one of the curtained off areas with a raised hospital bed. </p><p>Agatha feels her pulse pick up and Rio leans closer. </p><p>"Okay?"</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha licks her lips. "Nervous."</p><p>"Say the word and we can tell them you changed your mind."</p><p>Agatha ponders it but shakes her head, "I think it's just the needle," she confides. </p><p>Rio nods in sympathy as a nurse preps the tools and the long thin needle. "It'll be quick and then we can get out of here," she promises.</p><p>Agatha offers her a tight smile and lays on her side once the nurse instructs her to do so, giving Agatha a pillow to curl around as gloved fingers press and poke to count and find the correct vertebrae.</p><p>Rio sits in front of Agatha and the omega grasps her hand tightly in anticipation of pain. </p><p>The nurse moves through the process and kindly explains everything she's doing as she swipes iodine over Agatha's lower back.</p><p>"I'm gonna count you down okay?" The nurse speaks from behind Agatha and the omega offers a weak, "okay" in response, her anxiousness flooding Rio's senses as she grips Agatha's hand tighter.</p><p>"Three, two, one, poke-"</p><p>A pain blooms locally and Agatha winces but a secondary zap travels up her spine like aerial fireworks exploding in her head as she screams.</p><p>"Take it out!" Rio shouts and the nurse works quickly to safely remove the needle as Agatha clutches at her head, visions of a similar procedure flashing in her mind's eye:</p><p>
<em>Different voices. Heart monitor. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Lower back pain. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Did you have a good time?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Screaming. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah but my back still hurts, I think I threw it out harder than I thought.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She can't move. </em>
</p><p>
<em>I want to go home.</em>
</p><p>Agatha's eyes roll back and she starts to seize and the nurse calls for help as Rio ensures Agatha doesn't hit her head.</p><p>It only lasts for a few seconds but for Rio those seconds are a living nightmare, fighting the urge to panic as more personnel and Dr. Banner arrive, speaking quickly and inserting an IV as they get a disoriented Agatha ready for transport. </p><p>What worries Rio the most is that Agatha's scent disappears entirely. She can smell everything else but there is a large absence that has Rio's alpha in free fall.</p><p>Rio moves to follow but a nurse tries to stop her. Before she can unleash on the poor nurse, Dr. Banner calls to her, allowing Rio along who pushes past the nurse without waiting, walking quickly to keep up with the team. </p><p>"We need to sedate her and get her into an MRI just to be sure we didn't do any further damage," he explains to Rio who repeats it quietly to Agatha, murmuring next to her ear though the omega is still disoriented. </p><p>Rio whispers reassurances as they prep her and push a sedative into her IV and Rio's heart drops, hoping Agatha can forgive them when she wakes up. </p><p>Once the scan is done they move Agatha to a room for monitoring until she wakes up which thankfully doesn't take long. </p><p>As Agatha blinks awake, she initially panics and nearly rips the IV out before Rio can calm her down so she doesn't flee. </p><p>"I want this thing out of my arm," she growls and Rio calls for a nurse who shows up a few seconds later. </p><p>"It would be better to keep it in," the nurse tries when Agatha repeats her request but Agatha cuts her off.</p><p>"Take it out or I'll take it out myself," The omega threatens. </p><p>The nurse looks to Rio for help but the alpha says nothing, looking at the nurse expectantly for long enough that the nurse gives in and removes the IV, placing a piece of gauze and a wrap around Agatha's arm. </p><p>"I'll bring some water so you can at least stay hydrated," the nurse says and leaves, Rio nodding in thanks.</p><p>"What happened?" Agatha asks, propping herself up as Rio helps adjust the bed to a sitting position. </p><p>"The lumbar puncture triggered a seizure, they just did a scan to see if there's any damage," Rio sits in a chair, exhaling deeply and leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. </p><p>Footsteps approach and a nurse and Dr. Banner announce their presence with a knock on the wall. </p><p>"Hi Ms. Harkness, sorry for the scare," he steps into the space holding his laptop and pulls up her most current scans. </p><p>"You had a lot of sudden activity in your limbic system, seems like the lumbar puncture triggered your nervous system to fire all at once which, as you experienced, is not very pleasant. So we're going to forgo that option for now and explore other more non-invasive techniques."</p><p>Agatha rubs her head and Dr. Banner smiles tightly in sympathy, "You might have a nasty headache for a few hours but you're clear to take over the counter painkillers if needed."</p><p>He hands Rio his card, "I'll email later with next steps but for now, rest is the best option."</p><p>He leaves with a final promise that he'll be in touch.</p><p>Agatha gets dressed and Rio hugs her tightly, inhaling deeply now that Agatha's scent has returned, "You okay to ride back to the cabin? I could probably pull some strings to get a room in the city for the night."</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "I don't want to go anywhere new."</p><p>Rio nods in understanding and Agatha holds on to the crook of the alpha's arm until she finds her balance and her steps become more sure. </p><p>Earlier, Alice had dropped off a sedan for them to use and Rio goes to find the car while Agatha waits at the curb.</p><p>They stop by a drive through on Agatha's request, not wanting to cook anything at the cabin and craving a soda. Or probably the sugar, she thinks, hoping it'll help her headache a little.  </p><p>Soon they're on the highway, Agatha snacking on fries and handing Rio a fry every so often. </p><p>It's when they get to the outskirts of the city that Agatha relaxes enough to talk. </p><p>"I'm so fired after this," Agatha sighs.</p><p>Rio glances over and finds it a little funny that Agatha chooses to focus on that out of everything but people deal with life changing news in different ways and Agatha is no different. </p><p>"You could take the leave Lilia offered?" Rio suggests and Agatha huffs. </p><p>"I imagined I would be a partner by now," Agatha confesses.</p><p>"You still can be."</p><p>"Not if I'm a vegetable," Agatha points out bitterly. </p><p>Everything she's wanted is off the table. Her job, her marriage, motherhood...</p><p>The last one hurts the most but she tells herself this is the universe saying she shouldn't reproduce. She does have Evanora's blood in her veins and it might be best if it isn't passed along. </p><p>Still, a small part of her had hoped for a chance to raise a child with the love she never had, maybe if she were able to put something good in the world then her life would be worth it.</p><p>Those hopes are dashed violently, her outlook dim, her life ultimately amounting to nothing but pain and trauma; a cautionary tale for other omegas. </p><p>Her stomach turns as she contemplates her future. </p><p>It occurs to Agatha that she won't remember Rio either and her heart cracks open further, raging against the injustice of finding the alpha only to lose her after too short a time. </p><p>The gravity of the situation crashes down and Agatha starts to cry.</p><p>Rio reaches over with one hand and places it on Agatha's leg, letting her cry out her frustration and resentment as she mourns the future she'll never have. </p><p>It doesn't last long but Rio knows it won't be the last time she cries because of this case and nothing she says will make the news any easier.</p><p>"I'll be with you the whole way," Rio promises.</p><p>"Because it's your job," Agatha scoffs and Rio squeezes Agatha's leg and shakes her head.</p><p>"Because I want to be," Rio replies firmly.</p><p>The rest of the ride back to the cabin is silent and once they arrive back, Agatha curls up on the couch with a blanket, turning on the TV but not truly watching anything, simply stuck in her mind and not moving for the rest of the evening. </p><p>Rio feels helpless and she imagines Agatha feels the same. She wrecks her brain to think of anything that could help but she feels out of her depth, realizing that the kind of help Agatha needs should come from professionals.</p><p>Rio observes Agatha's profile. The omega randomly tears up every so often, her glassy eyes far away, lost in her thoughts and falling deeper into herself so quickly, Rio is concerned. Maybe she can eventually convince Agatha to attend counseling; feeling like an irritated Agatha would be better than a depressed one falling into ennui before her time. </p><p>Rio wants her to fight. She wants Agatha to hold on to her fire for as long as possible and though Agatha seems to think her fate is certain, Rio refuses to accept it as a certainty, choosing to have faith in Banner and his team because the other option is to lose Agatha and it's an option she won't entertain. </p><p>The alpha cuddles up to Agatha, fitting herself between Agatha and the couch, pulling the omega into the spot between her legs until she's cocooned in Rio's embrace. </p><p>Agatha pouts a little, annoyed that she's reluctantly feeling better with Rio near, having carved out a decent hole of self-pity. She doesnt resist, however, leaning into the embrace and silently accepting the alpha's support. </p><p>Rio makes comments on the shows they watch like they always do, filling the silence whether or not Agatha responds though Rio does manage to pull a brief snort once or twice from the omega, happy she can at least provide a temporary distraction.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The next morning, Rio is up early as usual but her excitement has her bouncing on her toes as she waits for Agatha to wake up and join her downstairs for coffee.</p><p>It's another half an hour before Agatha appears, squinting and grumbling under her breath about needing an upstairs bathroom before disappearing into the downstairs bathroom while Rio makes her coffee.</p><p>Rio makes some toast to share and brings out the jam and hazelnut spread for the table. </p><p>The last two pieces pop from the toaster when Agatha emerges and makes a beeline for her coffee, drinking at least half of it before reaching for the toast. </p><p>There's an aura around Agatha that Rio notices, like the emotional and mental burdens have consolidated in a fog that surrounds the omega. Rio hopes that what she has planned will help dissipate some of her burden or at least give her something to focus on. </p><p>"After we're done eating, can you go get dressed? I want to show you something I think you'll like but it's outside," Rio licks her sticky lips, unable to hide her nervousness.</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes and looks Rio up and down, finally noticing the alpha is dressed in leggings, shoes, and a black running jacket.</p><p>"Does it have to do with the case?" Agatha asks around a mouthful of toast.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, "Nope. Just something for fun and to get out of the house."</p><p>Agatha's eyes are still narrowed as she chews but she grunts an affirmation, making Rio grin and fidget with excitement. </p><p>Rio's enthusiasm is adorable, Agatha decides and plays a large factor in her agreeing to go, finding she doesn't have it in her to disappoint the alpha.</p><p>Agatha changes while Rio cleans up. When the omega reappears, Rio grins, taking in the simple white crop top and black leggings with a pair of keds, her alpha salivating like an old cartoon. </p><p>Rio's alpha tip taps with excitement, reduced to a happy puppy with every new part of Agatha she gets to see. Her eyes drop to Agatha's curves, dragging up and down as if she can feel them if she stares hard enough.</p><p>Agatha blushes and presses her lips together to suppress a smile. </p><p>"Let's go before I change my mind," she mumbles, walking past Rio toward the door, pretending she doesn't shudder when Rio playfully snaps her teeth after her.</p><p>-------------</p><p>They walk along a hidden path, closely bordered by trees. Agatha holds her hand out to touch some of them, sighing as she remembers how calming the forest is for her then immediately turning bitter when she thinks about forgetting everything she knows about herself.</p><p>Rio carries a backpack but doesn't seem to be in a rush, getting distracted by plants growing next to the path and birds flying and singing over head, identifying them by their call.</p><p>Agatha fondly calls her a nerd but listens to everything she says and looks whenever Rio points something out. </p><p>Eventually the path opens to a clearing, clearly prepped earlier with four thick wooden posts, about four feet high at the far end with a steeply sloped hill behind. On their side of the clearing is a stump large enough to use as a low table.</p><p>Agatha follows Rio as she places her backpack on the stump and starts to remove items, putting them down neatly in organized fashion. </p><p>Agatha recognizes her pistol and studies the other firearm Rio lays out. This one is larger and all black with sleek geometric lines that scream efficiency. </p><p>Rio gets excited as she lays out a collection of knives next, every edge sharpened by hand and oiled with care, clearly another interest of the alpha's if the slightly manic look is anything for Agatha to judge by.</p><p>The last thing Rio takes out is a box of ammunition for each firearm before putting the backpack aside and standing proudly at her lethal display. </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow and smirks, "This isn't an Old Yeller situation is it?"</p><p>Rio's eyes go wide and her mouth drops open in shock, torn between laughing and offense.</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>The omega laughs which eventually draws Rio into laughing with her; if Agatha has to deal with all this shit she gets to hold on to her dark humor and if she's being honest, it's fun to shock the alpha every so often.</p><p>"It's target practice, you ass," Rio's alpha is pouty and she reaches for Agatha, pulling her in by the waist. </p><p>"Don't worry," Agatha coos, "I don't really think you'd take me out back and shoot me," Agatha grins.</p><p>"You seem more like a 'smother in your sleep' kind of person."</p><p>Rio growls and pinches her hip and Agatha jumps, cackling, and Rio relishes in the sound.</p><p>"Load your magazine," Rio instructs, turning Agatha toward the weapons.</p><p>"Oh...speak sweetly," the omega winks over her shoulder and picks up a bullet to start loading while Rio watches carefully, assessing what Agatha already knows and what she needs more help with, giving her quiet pointers as her fingers stumble with unfamiliar movement. Rio knows it will come with practice so she doesn't worry too much at the moment.</p><p>Rio offers Agatha earplugs and she sticks them in her ears, following Rio's lead as she carries her weapon and magazine separate and walks over a few feet to stand across the posts at the end of the field.</p><p>"Once your gun is loaded, keep it pointed down range and away from you," Rio reminds, loading her magazine into her standard issue sidearm, taking her stance and focusing with practiced movement, taking aim and firing off two to three shots into each post in quick succession until her clip empties and she removes it from her firearm. </p><p>Agatha's pupils dilate as she watches the strong lines of Rio's body, the ease with which she loads and aims and hits the targets makes her mouth go dry and she licks her lips, suddenly understanding what Rio meant when she said competence is sexy. </p><p>She also recalls her conversation with Jen, <em>I have a big strong FBI agent remember?</em></p><p>Agatha had been joking but watching Rio, being reminded of her lethality, Agatha's inner omega quivers with want, drawn to the strength and skill of the alpha, admiring her as a protector.</p><p>"Your turn," Rio grins over her shoulder like she can tell what Agatha is thinking and the omega shakes herself out of her daze, stepping up next to Rio and facing the posts down range.</p><p>Rio takes the magazine from Agatha and nods toward the posts, "Show me your stance."</p><p>Agatha raises the unloaded firearm and plants her feet.</p><p>Rio walks around her, using her shoe to tap at Agatha's feet to position them. "Don't go sideways, your shot will start to veer with the recoil."</p><p>Rio puts her hands on Agatha's hips and tilts them toward an angle and Agatha is sure Rio's hands linger for a few seconds too long. </p><p>Her fingers move to Agatha's hands, positioning her hand higher on the grip.</p><p>"Hold it tightly and aim through the sights with both eyes open," Rio murmurs next to Agatha's ear.</p><p>"Now move your finger over the trigger."</p><p>Agatha drags her finger past the trigger guard, gently resting on cool metal.</p><p>"You're not going to pull the trigger, you're going to squeeze it with just your pointer finger," Rio continues, resting a hand against Agatha's lower back.</p><p>"Imagine crooking your finger," Rio's breath brushes against Agatha's ear, drawing goosebumps over her arms. </p><p>"Like you're saying 'come here'," Rio's voice drops and Agatha parts her lips, subtly trying to catch her breath and swearing she can feel the alpha's body heat against her back.</p><p>"Ready," Rio instructs, "Squeeze."</p><p>Agatha curls her pointer finger and the gun clicks on an empty barrel.</p><p>"Good," Rio smiles and hands Agatha the loaded magazine, breaking the spell over the omega who side eyes the other woman.</p><p>"Try it with live rounds," Rio takes a step back, giving Agatha space for safety sake. </p><p>"Load," she jerks her chin to the firearm in Agatha's hands.</p><p>Agatha lines up the magazine and slams it shut with the heel of her palm, clicking it into place, and pulls the slide back to load a round into the chamber.</p><p>The firearm is significantly heavier with bullets loaded and her arms and hands take a second to adjust to the new weight.</p><p>Rio is entirely focused on Agatha, murmuring adjustments to her stance and grip.</p><p>"Go ahead," Rio nods.</p><p>Agatha focuses on squeezing the trigger, a little surprised at the force of kickback as a puff of dirt to the left of a pole flies into the air. </p><p>"Close," Rio nods. "Try again, keep your wrists and forearms strong to help absorb the kickback."</p><p>Agatha aims again, frustrated with the minute shaking of her hand and squeezes the trigger. </p><p>Another explosion of dirt to the left goes up but it's a little closer to the pole.</p><p>"My hand won't stop shaking," Agatha complains, lowering the firearm.</p><p>"That will happen," Rio nods. "If you're shooting to protect yourself you're going to be moving and probably shaking from adrenaline."</p><p>Agatha scrunches her nose. She's more concerned about hitting her target than about the practical application of skill but what Rio says makes sense. </p><p>"So what do I do?" She asks, relying on Rio's expertise.</p><p>"The more you practice the more you adjust to it, sort of like a golf handicap. Plus it's rare to aim for specific parts of the body unless you're a trained sniper. Most times you want to aim for center mass, which is the chest and stomach area," Rio points to her own body to illustrate what she describes. </p><p>"It's a bigger target. Enough to disable or neutralize."</p><p>Agatha watches the alpha describe the process clinically, breaking down parts of her training into digestible bits for Agatha to consume.</p><p>"Have you ever shot someone?" She asks curiously.</p><p>Rio sticks her hands in her jacket pockets and nods, "Twice."</p><p>"Unrelated cases about three years apart."</p><p>"Were you...what did you feel? After?" Agatha remembers holding an empty pistol at Ralph and though she knew the firearm was unloaded, it still terrified her, wondering if she could live with the thought of actually taking away his life. </p><p>"Remember I told you about that panic attack in the shower?"</p><p>Agatha nods. </p><p>"That was the first time," Rio glances down range, rocking on her feet.</p><p>"Your first major case?" Agatha recalls and Rio nods. </p><p>"Yup," Rio's lips pop on the 'p'. "Almost quit after that."</p><p>"Why didn't you?" Agatha can't help but ask.</p><p>"Therapy," Rio smirks and Agatha scrunches her nose. "Plus I took some time to visit my family," she adds. </p><p>Agatha lifts the pistol again to aim and snorts at the thought of going to Evanora to make anything better. She takes a perverse joy in thinking about how annoyed her mother must be not knowing where she is.</p><p>Whatever will she tell her church?</p><p>Agatha squeezes the trigger and this time a piece of the pole splinters, thin pieces shimmering in the air and falling to the ground like confetti celebrating her achievements. </p><p>"Good shot," Rio grins and Agatha's pulse flutters at the praise. </p><p>"Again," Rio orders, "Shift your weight forward a little."</p><p>Agatha adjusts accordingly, trying to remember all the small movements, unable to benefit from muscle memory she hasn't developed yet. </p><p>She shoots again, hitting the top of the pole when she had technically been aiming at the same spot but she hit the goddamn pole so she'll take it. </p><p>Agatha tries switching targets with limited success, hitting once out of the last four shots before her clip empties.</p><p>Agatha pops the magazine and clears the chamber and Rio decides it's just as hot the second time. </p><p>"What's with the knives? Agatha tilts her head toward the shining steel laid out like chef's tools in a leather roll.</p><p>Rio's eyes light up and she trades the guns for the knives, bringing the roll, some of them small and thin, others more ornamental, or tactical, but one is larger, more like a dagger than a knife that Rio straps to her belt.</p><p>"Come on," Rio beckons Agatha as she walks closer to one of the wooden poles. </p><p>"These are just for fun but it's always good to have a back up to a gun," Rio explains, holding up a thin steel throwing knife and lining up her elbow, throwing the knife and watching it hit the wood with a thunk.</p><p>She hands one of the knives to Agatha who looks at Rio, lost as to what to do. Rio shows her where to grip and how to throw and when she releases, the knife thuds into the ground behind the pole.</p><p>"I like the gun better," Agatha decides immediately and Rio laughs and twirls a knife around her fingers.</p><p>"It's just practice," Rio assures. "Some knives are weighted some aren't. This one is more for stabbing than throwing," she picks up a triangular blade with a ring on the handle. "This one is fun, technically called a balisong but it's a butterfly knife," Rio flips the blade open, the hinged handle rotates in flashy circles, and it's another flip to close.</p><p>"What's with the big one?" Agatha nods to the one strapped to Rio's belt. </p><p>Rio unsheathes the dagger and shows it off, "This one is my baby, no practical use but she's really pretty. Damascus steel blade, ebony wood, bone, and pearl handle."</p><p>"Did you two want to be alone?" Agatha smirks and raises an eyebrow while the alpha twirls the knife between her fore and middle fingers and flips it from hand to hand.</p><p>"Show off," Agatha grins.</p><p>Rio's eyes sparkle with mischief, "How do you feel about a wager?"</p><p>Agatha scoffs, "Not great, considering I'd lose."</p><p>"We could change the rules?" Rio urges. "If I hit the target you win. If I miss, I win."</p><p>Agatha hums, intrigued, "What do you get if you win?"</p><p>"You try one therapy session," Rio grins and Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p>"And what do I get if I win?" </p><p>The alpha shrugs casually, "What do you want?"</p><p>The question strikes Agatha harder than she expects after what she experienced yesterday.</p><p>It's such a simple question that's been repeated in her life over and over in different ways. Evanora would ask as a reaction to unwanted interruption, Ralph would ask to end an argument, and every iteration after that became a challenge, as if what she wants is not the point at all, it's the act of wanting that becomes a sin.</p><p>Once upon a time she thought she knew what she wanted, she thought she had more time to pursue her desires, years to perfect her career and strengthen her marriage before having a child.</p><p>Now on a shortened timeline, those dreams are out of the question; her entire life is reframed into whatever stolen moments of happiness she can scavenge.</p><p>Rio asks the question so easily, even disguised as a game, Agatha knows whatever she asks for, Rio will give. The alpha is earnest and sincere in her devotion and with whatever time she has left, she wants to know what it's like to be lo- </p><p>Agatha stops herself.</p><p>She gathers her courage.</p><p>"Take me to bed," she answers quietly.</p><p>Rio almost drops her knife, "Sorry, what?"</p><p>"If I win," she says slowly, "I want you to take me to bed," Agatha repeats a little louder, licking her lips. </p><p>The conflict is evident on Rio's face. She wants Agatha to go to therapy, nudging her about it every so often but the temptation of finally having the omega is almost too much to ignore.</p><p>"That's not fair," Rio croaks.</p><p>"For me," Agatha shoots back. "Seems like either way, you win."</p><p>Rio huffs and glances at the wooden pole, deciding what to do. She side eyes Agatha and fidgets for a moment and the omega wonders if she's finally broken the other woman.</p><p>"Fuck it," Rio says finally and throws, hitting the pole dead center.</p><p>Rio doesn't give Agatha a chance to react; pulling her in and crashing their lips together, fisting her hand in Agatha's hair and shirt. She pushes herself away after too short a time, leaving Agatha stunned and breathless. </p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>-------------</p><p>The walk back takes twice as long when Rio pushes Agatha up against a tree, her hands growing bolder, brushing over her clothed ribs and further down to spread her fingers over Agatha's ass.</p><p>"So help me, Rio Vidal," Agatha groans, tilting her head to the side as Rio nips at her neck. "We're doing this in a bed."</p><p>"So far away," Rio grumbles as her hands travel under Agatha's shirt and palm her breasts, feeling her nipples pebble under the fabric of her sports bra.</p><p>Agatha arches into the touch, fisting her hand in Rio's jacket as a quiet gasp escapes her lips.</p><p>"You're not doing anything to fix that," Agatha counters, lifting her thigh just high enough to brush against Rio's hardening cock.</p><p>Rio hisses and her hips push forward on instinct, her alpha salivating while her focus narrows to include only the soft and willing omega pressed against her. </p><p>"Want you now," Rio growls, allowing herself to get drunk on Agatha's scent, brushing over the silvery scar at the base of Agatha's neck as the omega's eyes roll back for a moment, tempted to give in if not for the thought that she doesn't want to rush.</p><p>"Wait," Agatha gasps when Rio's hips make contact with hers. If they keep going, Agatha is going to end up naked in the woods and while it's not necessarily a bad thing, she wants to take her time.</p><p>Rio pauses, confused and a little wary, but Agatha takes the opportunity to flip their positions, admiring the obviously tented leggings before cupping Rio's face and kissing her soundly.</p><p>Agatha drags her hands down over Rio's neck and shoulders, pausing for a few moments over her chest before continuing downward, slowly lowering herself to her knees, enjoying the way Rio's eyes go wide and dark.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Rio swallows.</p><p>"Tying your shoe," Agatha replies sarcastically, reaching for the top of Rio's pants and peeling them down with slow deliberation. </p><p>"I did always forget which hole the bunny was supposed to go in," Rio snarks and Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>"Idiot," she grumbles, freeing Rio's cock from the confines of her briefs.</p><p>"Jesus," Agatha whispers, staring in admiration as her mouth waters. "You're bigger than I thought."</p><p>Rio groans, "I don't have enough blood for both my ego and my dick," she complains.</p><p>Agatha laughs and leans forward, grasping the base of the alpha's cock with one hand and bracing the other on Rio's thigh. She slowly begins stroking, enjoying how warm and soft her skin feels and the way Rio's brow furrows as she's lost to sensation.</p><p>Agatha presses her lips against the swollen head, teasing and kissing until Rio starts to leak and licking up the drops with the tip of her tongue.  </p><p>Lifting her hand, Agatha drags her flattened tongue from the base of the alpha's cock to the tip, letting the head sit heavy on her tongue as Rio looks down to savor the view.</p><p>"You're fucking killing me," Rio moans, one hand clawing at the tree and the other holding her jacket up out of the way. </p><p>Agatha looks up and some how manages to look innocent as her mouth continues to do sinful things, circling her tongue over the head and wrapping her lips around it to suck lightly.</p><p>During her marriage, Agatha hated doing this for Ralph. It felt like a chore, an expected action she was meant to fulfill. After a while, she got away with doing it less and less, figuring it was just something she didn't prefer. </p><p>With Rio above her, Agatha finds a sudden appreciation when her stomach swoops every time Rio moans, finding that she enjoys making the alpha react, aroused by how much and how plainly Rio wants her.</p><p>Agatha closes her lips over Rio's cock and bobs her head, taking a little more each time until she can feel the alpha on the back of her tongue. She pumps her hand a few times then holds Rio's cock still, fighting her gag reflex to take her just a little further.</p><p>Rio tries her best not to move, overwhelmed with the sight of Agatha on her knees, choking on her cock until her eyes water and she pulls back.</p><p>When Agatha lifts her cock again to run her tongue from base to tip, her tongue starts lower than it did last time, rubbing against a particularly sensitive spot that makes Rio's stomach jump. </p><p>Agatha is instantly thrilled and does it again; this time, Rio's hips jerk forward and she gasps.</p><p>"What the fuck was that?" Rio asks in shock, choking on her words when Agatha continues with a wicked grin.</p><p>She pumps her hand faster and adds more pressure with her tongue, making Rio arch her back almost off the tree as she clutches for any part of Agatha she can reach.</p><p>"Fuck, fuck, Agatha, I'm gonna come," Rio grunts through clenched teeth and Agatha takes Rio into her mouth again and sucks hard, silently demanding to feel Rio come down her throat. </p><p>"Oh, fuck!" Rio bows forward, her stomach and legs tightening as she spills against Agatha's tongue over and over while the omega greedily swallows every last bit. </p><p>Agatha drops kisses on the length of Rio's cock while the alpha pants and reaches down to wrap her fingers around the back of Agatha's neck, tugging her up until the omega stands and Rio can devour her swollen lips, tasting herself and humming in satisfaction.</p><p>"Think you can make it back to the cabin now?" Agatha smirks and presses a wet kiss to Rio's cheek.</p><p>Rio laughs and nods, "It's a very small window and closing."</p><p>"Then we should hurry," Agatha hums and helps Rio tuck herself back in and smooth her leggings out.</p><p>"Let's go," Rio tugs impatiently on Agatha's hand like the alpha isn't the reason they're still outside in the first place. </p><p>"I'm no where near done with you."</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>As soon as they're through the door, Rio drops the backpack and Agatha's hands reach for her jacket, unzipping it and pulling it off, leaving the alpha in her sports bra as she reaches for Agatha, breathing her in like air. </p><p>Rio's growl is a constant rumble in her chest, her alpha intent on leaving her scent everywhere on the omega, nuzzling her neck and chest, sucking red marks onto pale skin.</p><p>Rio pushes at Agatha's crop top until Agatha helps her push it over her head, pulling her hair tie with it, spilling mahogany waves over her shoulders intensifying the scent of fermented fruit, like rich red wine full of tannins and full-bodied.</p><p>Rio wastes no time reaching for Agatha's sports bra, pulling it roughly over her head and tightening her grasp on the garment around Agatha's shoulders, restraining her arms as she leans down to kiss the rounded curve of a breast.</p><p>Agatha hums with pleasure, offering herself up to Rio's mouth and tilting her chin down to watch, finding Rio's eyes as the alpha swipes her tongue over a pink pebbled nipple, drawing it between her lips and sucking, rolling the sensitive skin against her tongue.</p><p>Agatha's stomach clenches, the sensation traveling straight to her cunt as her eyes close and she tips her head back, releasing a breathy moan as her fingers curl and uncurl with frustration.</p><p>Rio smirks and laps at her breast, using her free hand to pinch and tug at the other nipple until it darkens and Agatha whines. </p><p>The omega loses patience and Rio lets her go so Agatha can shimmy out of her bra and Rio can drag her to the couch, pushing Agatha down to sit while Rio kneels over her, ghosting her lips over Agatha's sternum before falling to her knees.</p><p>"You don't have to," Agatha murmurs as Rio looks up at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"Just because I did it for you doesn't mean I'm expecting you to do it, too," she elaborates, brushing Rio's hair from her face. </p><p>Agatha's own experience tells her that most sexual acts are reciprocal. She shouldn't ask for what she isn't willing to give but Agatha did what she did because she wanted to and the thought of 'payback' feels like there's an imbalance between them that shouldn't exist.</p><p>Rio's expression drops to one of annoyance and Agatha worries she fucked everything up, dropping her eyes to look anywhere but at the alpha.</p><p>Rio crawls back up her body until she's inches from Agatha's face. </p><p>"I think I was fairly clear," Rio growls, pushing her hand against Agatha's stomach and slipping her fingers beneath the waistband of Agatha's pants.  </p><p>Agatha wants to look down but she can't bring herself to look away from Rio's face.</p><p>"I'm going to have <em>all</em> of you," Rio braces her free hand on the back of the couch, giving her leverage to move her other hand lower, pushing Agatha's underwear aside and swiping her finger against the seam of her cunt, coating it in arousal and pushing past the omega's entrance.</p><p>Agatha gasps at the sudden intrusion and her body lifts from the cushions, her eyelids fluttering as she clenches around the alpha's finger.</p><p>Just as quickly, Rio pulls her hand back and makes sure Agatha is watching as she sucks the digit between her lips, moaning in appreciation.</p><p>"Delicious," Rio grins.</p><p>The alpha resumes her position on her knees and curls her fingers over the waistband of Agatha's leggings, pulling down and divesting the omega of both pants and underwear, tossing them aside and leaving Agatha gloriously naked before her. </p><p>Rio tugs Agatha closer and parts her legs with gentle hands on the inside of pale thighs, exposing her glistening cunt that begs for Rio to taste.</p><p>"Fuck, you're beautiful," Rio licks her lips in anticipation while Agatha tries not to squirm under Rio's admiration. </p><p>Rio drops kisses to the inside of Agatha's thighs, working her way inward until she hovers over Agatha's cunt and slowly drags the tip of her tongue between her labia, parting her and opening the omega's cunt while Agatha keens.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," Agatha spreads her legs further, letting her head fall back against the couch and closing her eyes, focusing entirely on the velvet of Rio's tongue exploring every sensitive fold and crease, seeking out the things that draw moaning cries from the omega. </p><p>Rio flicks her tongue over the omega's swollen clit a few times, making Agatha's hips jump and enjoying the way her cunt flushes a pretty shade of pink as her desire practically drips like ambrosia onto Rio's eager tongue as she chases every drop.</p><p>Rio holds Agatha's hips in place as she slowly devours her, pleasure spiking when Rio passes over her clit in brief intervals that make Agatha whine and claw at the cushions before her fingers find their way into Rio's hair, rolling her hips insistently and tugging the alpha's dark hair to keep her where Agatha wants her.</p><p>Rio moans softly, pulling her mouth away for a moment as she pants. </p><p>"I'm never gonna get enough of you," she breathes, pupils blown as she gazes up at Agatha in awe, watching the way her stomach and chest move up and down and perching two fingers at the entrance to her cunt.</p><p>She slowly pushes them forward, watching as Agatha's surprised gasp turns into a needy moan, her eyebrows pushing together in concentration as her pulse flutters in her neck, tempting Rio's fangs. </p><p>To keep her mouth busy, Rio lowers her head, sucking Agatha's clit between her lips.</p><p>Agatha cries out and Rio holds tightly as the omega bucks her hips and lifts her heels to plant them on the edge of the couch to give herself something to push against and for leverage to rock her hips in time with Rio's thrusts. </p><p>Rio flicks her tongue back and forth, backing off when Agatha starts to tremble only to build her back up again.</p><p>"Don't stop," Agatha groans and pouts when Rio backs off for the third time, squirming in protest. </p><p>"Can't help it," Rio purrs, "You taste good."</p><p>"You act like this is the last time we'll be doing this," Agatha pants, circling her hips and trying to force Rio to speed up or push deeper or do something instead of keeping her just shy of climax.</p><p>Rio's eyes twinkle and she pushes her fingers in deeply on the next thrust, burying herself to the knuckle and making Agatha cry out sharply in relief.</p><p>"You'll let me do this again?" Rio grins and flutters her tongue over Agatha's pulsing clit.</p><p>Agatha has no brain power for a smart remark when her inner walls start to flutter.</p><p>"Yes!" She cries.</p><p>"Yes to what?" Rio pulls her mouth back to speak and Agatha is climbing so rapidly toward her orgasm she'll tell the alpha anything she wants as long as she puts her mouth back where she wants it. </p><p>"Yes! I'll fucking let you-" Agatha's stomach tenses and her knees lift toward her chest when Rio presses her flat tongue against her needy clit and torturously drags it back and forth.</p><p>"Fuck me," Agatha loses her train of thought, her body too overstimulated to think straight. </p><p>"Just fuck me," Agatha moans, "Fuck me and make me come... Rio, I need to come..." she starts to babble.</p><p>Rio is satisfied enough with her answer, lapping at Agatha's cunt with full strokes as her legs shake and her cries grow louder, pleasure sky rocketing after all the build up and throwing her head back when her cunt tightens.</p><p>"Oh, fuck! Oh f-" Agatha's stomach tenses and her fingers twist in Rio's hair as her toes curl over the edge of the couch, tumbling into her orgasm, pulsing around Rio's fingers as the alpha fucks her through her pleasure, curling her fingers until she can take no more.</p><p>Rio feels Agatha twitch with aftershocks as she slows and stops, dropping a few kisses and a final lick that makes Agatha's hips jerk with overstimulation. The alpha removes her fingers and sucks them into her mouth, licking them clean and humming in satisfaction. </p><p>When Agatha's eyes open, the blue is gone, swallowed entirely by black pupils. Every cell in her body is attuned to the alpha like sunflowers following the sun, her omega basking in Rio's attention, keeping her arousal at a low simmer when she inhales.</p><p>Rio's scent is dark; a forest under a full moon, rustling from the bushes, a glimpse of yellow eyes, the sense of being stalked and watched by something bigger and stronger than her waiting to pounce. </p><p>Agatha wants to run but she isn't afraid; she wants to be chased.</p><p>She wants to sprint into the night, listening for the rushing presence behind her, letting her laugh get carried away on the wind as the predator nips at her heels until she's ready to jump, pulling Agatha back in to reclaim her only to release her to let the game begin anew.</p><p>Agatha crooks her finger and Rio eagerly obeys, climbing over Agatha's body and tenderly claiming her lips, letting Agatha taste herself while she presses her clothed hips against Agatha and groans. </p><p>The omega grins against Rio's lips and presses her hand to Rio's sternum, sitting up as the alpha backs up.</p><p>Rio looks after Agatha in confusion when she slips out from under her and follows her with her eyes as Agatha stops at the bottom of the stairs and looks over her shoulder, crooking her finger again with a wicked smile. </p><p>"Come," she purrs.</p><p>Rio is up so fast that Agatha lets out a surprised, "Ah!" And scrambles up the stairs laughing; Rio hot on her tail.</p><p>She almost catches Agatha halfway up, pushing her against the wall, but Agatha slips from her grasp with a teasing grin, enthralling the alpha as she chases after Agatha, crashing into her back at the top of the stairs, wrapping her arms around the other woman.</p><p>Rio buries her nose in Agatha's hair as her hands roam freely, squeezing her breasts and pressing a hand low against Agatha's stomach as the alpha grinds her hips against her ass.</p><p>Agatha hums and turns around, curling her fingers in the straps of Rio's sports bra and directing her to the bed, pushing the alpha down onto the mattress with a self-satisfied smirk and motioning for her to raise her arms so Agatha can peel the sports bra away. </p><p>She also makes quick work of Rio's leggings and briefs, tossing them aside and sighing as she finally gets to see the alpha in her entirety. Her skin is smooth, rippling over the muscle of her arms and stomach and rounding the slight curve of her breasts. Agatha's eyes drop to Rio's cock, sitting hard against the plane of her stomach and Agatha swallows, her mouth watering. Rio is certainty bigger than she's used to and her cunt twitches in anticipation. </p><p>"You're beautiful," Agatha murmurs, running her hands over Rio's smooth thighs as she climbs over the alpha and straddles her hips. She leans down, wasting no time in taking a dusky nipple between her lips and sucking, drawing a choked cry from Rio's throat. </p><p>Agatha reaches between them and grasps Rio's cock, pumping her hand up and down as Rio's eyes roll back and her body jerks, torn between dueling pleasure. </p><p>The omega decides payback is in order and lowers her cunt, rubbing herself against the length of Rio's shaft, biting down gently on the sensitive nipple in her mouth. </p><p>"Oh, shit," Rio hisses, her hands grasping Agatha's thighs as she tilts her hips back, unable to resist the temptation to try and slip inside though Agatha keeps herself just out of reach. </p><p>"Fucking tease," Rio grumbles, lifting her hips and dropping them hard enough that Agatha bounces a bit which only ads to Rio's torture. </p><p>Agatha's slick coats her cock and Rio's hands grasp Agatha's ass, not satisfied now that she's so close to where she wants to be.</p><p>"What are you gonna do about it?" Agatha rolls her hips and Rio grins; she's been waiting for her opportunity. </p><p>Rio plants her heels on the mattress and lifts her hips, rolling to the side and taking Agatha with her. The omega cradles Rio between her legs and Rio sits up on her knees, grasping the base of her cock and rubbing the head against Agatha's cunt. </p><p>"Go slow," Agatha whispers, her body shivering in anticipation.</p><p>Rio rubs her thumb against Agatha's leg and nods, holding herself steady and pressing against Agatha's entrance.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curl in the comforter, panting quietly as the pressure builds and builds and finally the head of Rio's cock breaches her cunt, making her cry out and fist her hands. </p><p>"Holy shit, you're so fucking tight," Rio gasps, her body tense as she wrangles all of her self control and moves with deliberate intent, thrusting shallowly until Agatha begins to open for her. </p><p>Agatha's sounds are high and breathy and her head falls back, her hair a messy halo against the comforter.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio asks, watching intently for signs of discomfort. </p><p>Agatha nods and Rio pushes forward a little more while Agatha lets out a high whine. She feels like she's splitting in half, almost too full as her cunt stretches and flutters, still wanting her deeper.</p><p>Rio's hips finally settle against the inside of Agatha's thighs and the alpha lays her top half over Agatha, pressing their chests together and dropping little kisses to Agatha's chin, cheek, forehead, and nose; anywhere she can reach. </p><p>Agatha wraps her arms around Rio's back, dragging her fingertips over her ribs and shoulders and turning her head to capture Rio's lips, swiping her tongue over the alpha's bottom lip and flicking over a sharp incisor that sends shivers down Rio's spine, tempted to lower her teeth to Agatha's neck before reeling her alpha back like a dog pulling at the end of a leash. </p><p>Trying to find a compromise, Rio nudges Agatha's head to the side and ducks her head to flatten her tongue against the sensitive skin of her healed mating mark.</p><p>"Oh, Rio," Agatha moans, her cunt flooding with another wave of arousal as she arches her back, giving Rio the opportunity to slip an arm under Agatha as she begins rocking her hips.</p><p>Agatha's breath comes in stuttering gasps as Rio's cock creates a maddening friction inside her, filling and retreating in a steady rhythm as Rio's groans fill her ear, her lips sucking a dark bruise over her mating scar, triggering her omega's instinct to release her own pheromones and spread her legs further.</p><p>Rio inhales deeply and she tears her mouth away from the temptation to bite, lifting Agatha's chest to her mouth, bowing Agatha's back and making her look like a Greek goddess in rapture. </p><p>Rio swipes her tongue over a nipple and Agatha grinds her hips upward, pressing her clit against Rio every time she thrusts forward.</p><p>"Feels so good," Agatha moans, deliberately squeezing herself around Rio as the alpha drops her forehead to Agatha's chest.</p><p>"Oh fuck, do that again," she groans, thrusting forward and rolling her hips, hitting something deep inside Agatha that makes her entire body jerk as her nails dig into Rio's back, stinging and sharp in an intoxicating mix of pleasure and pain.</p><p>Agatha obeys and Rio pumps her hips faster, the sound of skin on skin fills the room as Rio zeroes in on that one spot that makes Agatha's legs shake as her cries grow louder and more incoherent.</p><p>Rio presses Agatha against the bed, nearly smothering her as her cries grow muffled when the omega buries her face in Rio's shoulder and the alpha scoops her other arm under Agatha's back to curl over her shoulder, using the leverage to pull Agatha forward in time with her thrusts, a choked scream clawing it's way from Agatha's chest as her aching cunt weeps and trembles and her omega begs to be bred.</p><p>"Fuck, yes! Rio! Alpha! Oh my fucking god," Agatha feels like she's losing her mind, nothing more than a thing for the alpha to use for her pleasure, letting her instinct reign over her higher functions, reduced to her base elements and put back together by the alpha surrounding her inside and out, overtaking her every sense, physical and common.</p><p>A pained groan answers from Rio's chest, her alpha spurred on as she's addressed directly, pistoning her hips faster, her strokes pulling back to the entrance of Agatha's cunt before burying herself fully, building toward her orgasm as their skin slides together, a thin sheen of sweat covering both their bodies, drawing gasping breaths between strained cries.</p><p>"Say it again," Rio demands, pulling her head back enough to look down at the flushed omega. </p><p>Agatha opens her eyes, heavy-lidded and drunk on pheromones and a deep seated need programmed into her DNA. Rio's eyes shine with an ethereal gleam; a lethal predator in the throes of passion, brought to the height of insatiable desire by the willing and pliable omega beneath her.</p><p>"Alpha," Agatha whimpers. "My alpha."</p><p>Rio's answering moan is low and long, drawing out Agatha's name as her stomach tightens, "I'm gonna come," she warns, voice strained.</p><p>Agatha tightens her hold, "Inside me, come inside me," she demands.</p><p>Rio lets out a babbling string of curses, pumping her hips a few more times before her legs and her ass tense, her stomach clenching as she comes in spurts.</p><p>Agatha cries out and grinds her hips against Rio, chasing her orgasm. She wants to come around her alpha's cock, full to the point of exploding, chasing the high her omega demands. </p><p>Rio pauses for a few seconds and Agatha whimpers in complaint, desperately rolling her hips; so close to release.</p><p>The alpha slides back in and Agatha moans, a gutteral sound as Rio quickly returns to her punishing pace, choking on a cry when Rio snakes a hand between them and pinches her clit.</p><p>Agatha's body tenses and shakes as she comes, squeezing her legs around Rio's hips as the bedframe scratches against the floor, her whole body rocking with the momentum of Rio's thrusts as she cries out with a strained voice.</p><p>"Fuck!" Rio groans thrusting forward a few more times, surprising Agatha when she feels the alpha empty herself again, shuddering with her final release.</p><p>Rio pulls back, leaving open mouthed kisses against Agatha's neck and chest before sitting up and looking down, easing her softening cock from the omega's flushed cunt just to watch her seed drip between swollen lips as Agatha's chest heaves up and down, her pale skin bruised and marked, sweat pooling in the dip between her breasts. </p><p>The omega looks thoroughly fucked and Rio needs to punch down the flicker of arousal at the sight, her appetite for Agatha apparently bottomless; but when the omega drapes an arm over her eyes and smiles...Rio feels like she may explode for a whole other reason.</p><p>"What?" Rio asks playfully and Agatha chuckles softly.</p><p>"Jen is never going to let me hear the end of this."</p><p>Rio's eyes drop into a deadpan stare in mock offense, "You're thinking about Jen right now? Really?"</p><p>Agatha scoffs, "She's been trying to get me to fuck you for weeks."</p><p>Rio snaps her mouth shut on her retort and pretends to ponder, "I need to send her flowers."</p><p>Agatha chuckles, "She likes chrysanthemums."</p><p>"Now, help me up," she demands,"Someone made a mess and the only bathroom is downstairs," Agatha complains, glaring playfully at a proud Rio. </p><p>"It's not a mess, it's art," Rio insists, rolling off of Agatha and holding out a hand to help her off the bed, wincing in sympathy when Agatha makes a face and hisses at the ache between her legs. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "Your cum is art?"</p><p>She scoffs and walks past Rio who catches her around the waist and presses her front against Agatha's back, reaching between the omega's legs to cup her hand over her cunt. </p><p>"No," Rio growls and Agatha gasps, her pulse skipping, "<em>You</em> are the art. If I could keep you in bed, fucked and full on my dick and dripping with cum, I would."</p><p>Rio's voice is a low purr in Agatha's ear and despite the soreness her cunt twitches and Rio can feel it, grinning smugly. </p><p>"You're a menace," Agatha swats her away as Rio laughs and follows her down the stairs, Agatha looking over her shoulder curiously. </p><p>"What? I need a shower," she says innocently. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and smiles to herself as Rio trails after her, starting the water and adjusting the temperature while Agatha uses the bathroom and joins her after a moment behind frosted glass.</p><p>The rain shower head is large enough to cover both of them. Agatha helps Rio wash her back, soothing the angry red lines her nails left on the smooth planes of skin while Rio in turn washes Agatha's hair, tilting her head back gently to rinse the shampoo down the drain. </p><p>Neither move to shut off the water once they're done washing; instead Agatha wraps her arms around Rio's shoulders and the alpha's arms weave around her waist. </p><p>Agatha rests her head against Rio's and sighs heavily, closing her eyes and basking in the moment, paying close attention to the way Rio's skin feels against hers and the way it feels to be held in her arms.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio whispers, close enough to be heard over the running water. </p><p>"Mhm," Agatha answers, "I want to remember this for as long as I can."</p><p>Rio holds her tighter and sighs, exhaling heavily through her nose, "We'll find a way to fix it."</p><p>Agatha doesn't want to ruin their time with arguing so she says nothing, content to stay there until their fingers get pruney and the water runs lukewarm. </p><p>Rio shuts off the water and Agatha grabs their towels, handing Rio hers and drying off enough to scurry upstairs to change into comfortable clothes.</p><p>Rio changes out the comforter and giggles, teasing Agatha about the wet spot left there while Agatha glares and blames Rio in turn, crawling into the bed before Rio makes it, stretching languidly while Rio openly appreciates the view. </p><p>"Nap time?" Rio asks, watching Agatha curl up under the comforter.</p><p>Agatha hums, "Some of us don't run on batteries."</p><p>Rio grins with mischief, "Sometimes I forget you're older than me."</p><p>"And you'll continue to forget if you know what's good for you," Agatha yawns, effectively undermining her threat. </p><p>"Stay until I fall asleep?" Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio climbs in without second thought, curling herself around Agatha and tangling their legs together and rubbing her cheek against Agatha's shoulder, mixing their scents together; a forest in bloom, fruit by the river and fertile fields, ripe for new beginning.</p><p>Agatha settles and her body grows heavy, her breaths falling into even rhythm as Rio keeps silent watch.</p><p>-------------</p><p>When she wakes an hour later, Agatha finds Rio downstairs, diligently working on her laptop. </p><p>When she sees Agatha, Rio puts the computer aside and reaches for the omega, motioning for her to come closer until Rio can pull her into her lap.</p><p>Agatha's knees bracket Rio's hips and she rests her weight on Rio's legs, leaning forward as Rio wraps her arms around the other woman. </p><p>Agatha had dreamt again; not a nightmare or a memory but an actual dream. </p><p>She had been on her honeymoon again, sitting next to a pool, dressed as her younger self but some how with her older self's awareness. There was a moment of concern when she heard a sliding door but instead of Ralph, Rio walked toward her, bowl of cut fruit in hand, dressed in a white one-piece bathing suit, her gauzy floral cover up floating in the air behind her. </p><p>The dream then cut to Agatha's point of view, Rio across from her at a table, holding a flute of champagne, dressed as she had been from the gala, the view from the balcony familiar as one of the restaurants she had been to a few times with Ralph. </p><p>The last thing she remembers is a park, the same one she and Rio met her mother at, except it was full of families; parents and children crowded the playground and she could feel Rio's solid presence next to her. </p><p>From behind her a small voice called, "Mama!" </p><p>And she had turned. </p><p>Agatha had laid in bed, silent tears leaking from the corners of her eyes over her temples and into her hair. </p><p>It felt like torturous teasing and grief at the same time, subconsciously mourning the loss of a life she will never live. </p><p>A list of things to do to prepare ran through her mind: where she would live, researching long term care facilities, maybe some videos to herself to help her remember, or a journal, instructions and letters for Jen, a last will and testament while she's of sound mind...</p><p>She had made a mental note to make a physical list.</p><p>With the time Agatha has left, she wants to be happy. Considering her circumstances, it's the least she is owed and if the universe won't give it to her, she'll take it. The problem though is she doesn't know how to manage this burden while also enjoying what she's found. </p><p>Agatha sighed. She didn't want to talk about it with Rio. No doubt it would upset the alpha and Agatha can't bring herself to be the one to snuff out the bit of hope she has when reality will do that for her eventually. </p><p>So Agatha had made a decision, one that would make Rio happy and benefit her as well.</p><p>"I'll talk to Dr. Banner," she murmurs loud enough for Rio to hear. </p><p>"About what?" Rio mumbles back and Agatha smiles. </p><p>Sometimes she wonders if Rio is clueless but she guesses since Agatha had rejected the option earlier, Rio had let it go in an effort to respect her wishes. </p><p>"Counseling," Agatha replies. </p><p>Rio leans back to look up at the omega, "Really?"</p><p>Agatha nods. </p><p>"You're sure?" Rio cups Agatha's face.</p><p>"I thought you wanted me to go?" Agatha asks, eyebrow rising as she shifts her hips and rubs herself against Rio's lap.</p><p>"I do," Rio swallows visibly, dropping her hands to Agatha's hips, "Just want to make sure you don't feel pressured..."</p><p>Agatha rolls her hips with more purpose and lets herself surrender to the desire that feels ever present when she's with Rio.</p><p>"One of us is in a position to be pressured right now and it isn't me," Agatha grins, purposefully releasing pheromones that have Rio swelling beneath her.</p><p>Agatha grinds back and forth, making herself achingly wet but it's a small price to pay just to watch Rio's head fall back against the couch as her hands grip her tighter and the alpha's hips roll upward. </p><p>"I bet I could make you come in your pants if I ride you long enough," Agatha purrs, releasing another wave of pheromones and gripping the back of the couch on either side of Rio's head. </p><p>"You wouldn't do that," Rio growls, her hands travelling to Agatha's ass, squeezing and encouraging her to grind down harder.</p><p>"I could," Agatha teases with a grin. </p><p>"I could also throw you down on this couch and fuck you," Rio threatens with a squeeze.</p><p>Agatha hums and leans over Rio, her wavy hair falling over her shoulders.</p><p>"But you're not going to do that," Agatha's voice is hypnotizing and sweet, poorly disguising the underlying mischief.</p><p>"Because you're a good boy, aren't you?" </p><p>Rio's skin erupts in goosebumps and she swallows a groan.</p><p>"And if I am?" Rio asks curiously. </p><p>Agatha reaches between them with one hand and rubs her palm over the bulge in Rio's pants.</p><p>"Then you get rewarded," Agatha purrs, slipping her hand under the top of Rio's pants and wrapping her hand around her warm cock, stroking her confidently and enjoying the way Rio feels in her hand.</p><p>Rio's chest moves up and down, her heart picking up as Agatha pumps her cock steadily. Rio moves her hands to push her pants down just enough to free her cock, giving Agatha more room.</p><p>"Good boy," Agatha praises and Rio's hips buck into Agatha's hand. </p><p>Rio moves to ease her fingers into Agatha's shorts but Agatha stops her.</p><p>"No touching," Agatha scolds. She takes Rio's hands and puts them back on her ass. </p><p>"Stay there," she orders, lifting her shirt over her head and dropping it on the couch next to them. </p><p>Rio licks her lips and her pupils shrink and grow in turn as she eyes Agatha's breasts, hovering temptingly close and calling to her, like they're begging for Rio's mouth. </p><p>"God you're so fucking hot," Rio breathes, circling her hips to increase the friction against Agatha.</p><p>Agatha tosses her hair over her shoulder and sits up on her knees, shuffling backward and standing to remove her shorts before kneeling over Rio again, grasping her cock to line it up with her cunt, settling over it little by little until she's fully seated in Rio's lap.</p><p>"Your pussy feels so good," Rio's hands roam over Agatha's legs, squeezing her hips and ass, too restless to stay in one spot for too long.</p><p>"Keep talking," Agatha rolls her hips and grazes her teeth over the edge of Rio's jaw.</p><p>"Fuck, fuck, fuck...if I could stay inside you forever I'd never leave this couch," Rio massages Agatha's ass and encourages her to move faster. </p><p>Agatha lifts up and impales herself on Rio's cock, falling into a steady rhythm as she starts to ride the alpha. </p><p>"Keep going," Agatha groans.</p><p>Rio takes a moment to concentrate, her fingertips grabbing Agatha's hips hard enough to leave bruises on her skin. </p><p>"I'd keep you tied to the bed," Rio growls through clenched teeth. "Open and dripping constantly."</p><p>Agatha moans and arousal drenches Rio's cock, making the alpha grin, sensing an opportunity to take the upper hand. </p><p>"You like that idea?" Rio hums, "Taking you whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted."</p><p>Rio thrusts up into Agatha every time her hips roll, using her grip to pull Agatha down harder, burying herself to the hilt each time. </p><p>"And you wouldn't even complain would you?" Agatha's movements start to quicken, holding on to the back of the couch to keep her balance. Rio's sly grin is missed behind her closed eyes. </p><p>"You'd bend over like a good omega and spread your legs," Rio continues and Agatha shudders, her cunt clenching around Rio.</p><p>Rio gathers Agatha's hair in a fist and tugs, pulling her head back, mouth dropping open in pleasure.</p><p>"Letting me use your pussy until I'm satisfied and you're begging to come," Rio slips her hand between them, using her thumb to swipe across Agatha's clit. </p><p>Agatha gasps and rides Rio harder, throaty moans mixing with the wet sounds between them as Rio plants her feet firmly and forces the pace faster, dipping her head to kiss and suck at Agatha's breasts like she's dying of thirst.</p><p>Rio flicks her thumb faster and bites down gently on a swollen nipple, rolling it between the edge of her teeth; Agatha jerking and bucking her hips as Rio pushes her headlong into her climax, her cunt clamping down hard enough that Rio stills, her groans mixing with Agatha's cries as the omega shudders against her.</p><p>Agatha is still shaking when Rio rolls them to the side, making the omega cry out with loss when Rio pulls out, but she has little time to complain when Rio grabs her ankles and flips her onto her stomach.</p><p>The alpha rapidly sheds her clothes and crawls over Agatha's body and nudges Agatha's knees apart with her own, coming back to the sweet warmth of the omega's cunt as she enters her again in one fluid stroke. </p><p>Agatha gasps and cants her hips backward just as Rio cups a hand under her chin, tilting her head back as Rio leans over her, hips pressing against her ass, and cock nestled deep in her cunt. </p><p>"So fucking beautiful," Rio leans down to hungrily catch Agatha's lips, nipping at her with sharp teeth before pulling herself away.</p><p>"Now moan for me," she growls.</p><p>And Agatha does.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha does eventually call Dr. Banner after Rio makes her come two more times.</p><p>They agree to a session when Agatha comes in for more testing a few days later. In the mean time, between jumping one another when they can, Agatha and Rio navigate their new closeness while Agatha prepares for the worst. </p><p>She starts recording videos when Rio isn't around along with writing down things she can remember when they come to her. She also writes down important things she would like her future self to remember. Her favorite color is purple, she doesn't like to drink dairy, the story behind the scar on her elbow, what schools she went to...little things that make her who she is. </p><p>She records nothing about Ralph.</p><p>When it becomes overwhelming, Agatha seeks out Rio, finding refuge in the alpha's presence. </p><p>Her plan is seemingly justified the night before they're due back in town when Rio wakes in the middle of the night to find Agatha sitting at the edge of the bed. </p><p>Rio's subconscious mind nags at her, telling her something is wrong; when she inhales, Agatha's scent is muted, like Rio is wearing a mask, making her alpha worry.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio sits up and rubs her eye, hair falling in her face. </p><p>Agatha doesn't respond, doesn't move.</p><p>Rio's brow furrows with concern and the bed dips as she scoots herself toward the other woman to sit next to her.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio tries again, placing a hand on Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>Her touch seems to get Agatha's attention and the omega slowly turns her head to look at Rio, but something is wrong.</p><p>Agatha's expression is blank and she stares at Rio without recognition, tuned to her like she's listening and waiting. </p><p>"Agatha, talk to me, please," Rio shakes off the last remnants of sleep, her unease forcing her into alertness as she takes Agatha's face in her hands.</p><p>Agatha doesn't respond.</p><p>A tremor of fear runs down Rio's spine and she gets up to turn on a lamp, flooding the area with soft yellow light. Agatha doesn't move, more still than Rio has ever seen her. It's unsettling and the lack of talking even more so.</p><p>When Rio walks back to the omega and cups her face, Agatha doesn't fight her. The alpha lifts Agatha's face to look at her, finding her pupils have almost disappeared. The pale blue is all that stares back, hollow and vacant.</p><p>Rio recognizes the look and behavior from the videos but seeing it in person and experiencing it drives Rio's alpha to a whole new level of panic, especially with her muted scent. </p><p>"Come back," Rio pleads before she can stop herself.</p><p>The omega simply looks at her unable to understand her command.</p><p>Rio wraps her arms around Agatha and buries her nose in her hair, greedily chasing Agatha's scent while her own floods over the omega as her alpha tries to reach her. </p><p>"It's me," Rio whispers, "It's Rio, please come back."</p><p>Rio doesn't realize she's teared up until Agatha's arms startle then wrap around the alpha. </p><p>"Hey," Agatha murmurs, blinking a few times, confused and uncertain. She had been asleep and now suddenly Rio is crying in her arms and one of them turned on a light. </p><p>"What's wrong?" Agatha tries to soothe and Rio pulls back, staring hard at Agatha and sighing heavily in relief when her scent floods back in all at once.</p><p>Agatha's eyes are back to normal and Rio has never been so happy to see Agatha frown. </p><p>Rio sniffles as she lets go, swiping at her eyes as she tries to reign in her emotions, "You, uh, went blank."</p><p>"Like the videos," Rio adds quietly.</p><p>"Blank?" Agatha asks. She doesn't remember anything. The last thing she recalls is falling asleep with Rio, between then and now there's nothing. Not even dreams.</p><p>Rio nods, watching Agatha process. </p><p>"Can you," Agatha starts, eyes darting back and forth as she chooses the most practical path.</p><p>"Can you tell them what happened tomorrow? I'm going to write it down in my phone but...it might help if you add your side."</p><p>Rio nods and stretches across the bed to grab their phones and hands Agatha's to her. She's distracted by a message from Jen and opens it to a photo of a small arrangement of pink chrysanthemums.</p><p>Agatha barks a laugh and Rio's head whips to the omega, confused about the sudden shift. </p><p>Agatha turns her phone to show the photo to Rio whose expression morphs into a sly grin.</p><p>"Oh good, she got them," Rio chuckles.</p><p>Agatha takes her phone back and scrolls down to another photo of the included card signed with a simple 'thank you' from Rio and the last message from Jen who says Agatha will be explaining the next time they talk.</p><p>Smiling to herself, Agatha closes out her messages and opens her notes to write down what she needs to for the doctors, sighing when she's finished and turning her attention to Rio.</p><p>Despite what Agatha had said before, she too forgets that Rio is younger than her. The alpha carries a maturity that she's probably carried from childhood and even Agatha is blind to her vulnerability at times. </p><p>Now, with her legs crossed and shoulders slumped, Agatha can picture the alpha's younger self, hugging her knees with mussed hair and wide honey colored eyes. </p><p>For the first time, the other woman looks so young and small. Agatha notices the bags under her eyes and how tired she looks. The omega's heart drops and she reaches out to pull Rio's head against her chest.</p><p>Rio's arms unfold and wrap around Agatha, exhaling shakily as Agatha combs her fingers through the alpha's hair. </p><p>"I'm sorry I scared you," Agatha whispers, rubbing her cheek against Rio's hair.</p><p>Rio inhales deeply, filling her lungs with Agatha's scent in reassurance, "It's okay, it was just really... intense to experience in person I guess."</p><p>Agatha nods and rocks them both back and forth gently. She hates that this is only the beginning. Rio will eventually get used to her episodes and her shock and fear will turn to quiet acceptance, but the journey there will be hard. </p><p>"I know," Agatha murmurs, "But I'm here now."</p><p>Rio hugs her tighter. After a few moments, Rio starts to sag, her body growing heavy with sleep, comforted by Agatha's citrus blossom scent and her heartbeat against her ear. </p><p>Reluctantly Agatha untangles her arms and nudges Rio back toward the covers while she turns out the light. When she returns to bed, Agatha reaches for Rio, pulling her into her side so Rio's head can rest on her chest. </p><p>Rio drapes her arm and a leg over Agatha, hanging on to her as if she can keep Agatha with her simply by holding on tightly and Agatha wishes that were true. She doesn't know what she can do to protect the other woman but perhaps it isn't about protection; Rio is protective and capable in her own right. </p><p>What she needs is a soft place to land when her job is done. </p><p>Agatha presses her lips against Rio's head. </p><p>She's never been considered 'soft' but Agatha decides she can make an exception.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"Hello again, Agatha."</p><p>Dr. Banner enters his office, once again carrying his laptop, and sits opposite Agatha in a cushioned chair.</p><p>His office is rather large with a seating area that Agatha assumes he uses for sessions like this or to work late into the night. She knows if this were her office, legal files and paperwork would take up a good portion of the coffee table between them at least. </p><p>"Hello," Agatha greets, her legs crossed and hands folded in her lap. She feels like she's being judged for the science experiment she is and tries to shake off those thoughts. She promised Rio she would try.</p><p>Banner opens his laptop and brings up the results from the scans and bloodwork they did earlier, "If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over your tests and give you an update on where we are."</p><p>Agatha nods for him to continue. </p><p>"Your bloodwork looks good, no changes from last time, and your scans show some activity but not an aggressive progression of deterioration which is good. We'll keep monitoring and if anything changes drastically please let us know immediately."</p><p>Agatha nods again. She doesn't really have a response to give him so she remains silent. </p><p>"If you don't have any questions," he says after a pause, "Then we can move on to why else you're here today."</p><p>Agatha swallows, nerves fluttering in her stomach as she presses her lips together and shakes her head. </p><p>Banner closes his laptop and sets it aside, leaning forward and resting an elbow on the arm of his chair, adopting a more casual posture. </p><p>"Okay then," he smiles kindly, "How are you feeling today?"</p><p>Agatha can't help herself and laughs, a short severe sound, "That's... really?"</p><p>Banner smiles like he's laughing at himself and shrugs, "It's a legitimate question."</p><p>"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to ask me about my trauma or my childhood or something?" Agatha raises an eyebrow in judgement.</p><p>"I could if you want to talk about it," Banner offers, "But I thought we might ease into a conversation and get to know one another since we've only met a few times."</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together and clenches her jaw because she can see what he's doing and he's right; she needs to be able to trust him first. </p><p>"Technically you already know about me if you're assigned to my case," Agatha points out and Banner is quick to agree.</p><p>"Technically you're right," he concedes.</p><p>"So tell me what you know so I'm not repeating myself," Agatha challenges, leveling her gaze with his. </p><p>"I would rather hear it from your point of view," Banner suggests gently but Agatha narrows her eyes.</p><p>"Be a sport and tell me anyway," she tilts her head, voice mocking and Banner holds up his hands in surrender.</p><p>"I know that your ex-mate is the CEO of a drug company under investigation for supplying a type of designer drug to omega trafficking rings," he starts slowly and Agatha listens intently, lifting her elbow to rest on the chair arm and pressing her finger against her temple.</p><p>"Go on," she replies.</p><p>"Your ex-mate and two of his partners have been accused of testing the drug on you and their wives. One of whom is deceased and the other non-responsive in the hospital," Banner continues.</p><p>"Their actions lead to your compromised memory and continuing struggle with episodes of shut down," he finishes and Agatha shrugs.</p><p>"Yeah that's about the gist of it," she frowns.</p><p>"Is that how you would describe it?" He asks.</p><p>Agatha pauses and Banner waits patiently, annoying Agatha. Silence, or the awkwardness of it, was something Agatha used to make others uncomfortable or to make witnesses talk, finding that people wanted to fill silences. </p><p>It annoys her because it's working. </p><p>"Not in so many words," Agatha answers finally.</p><p>"What words would you use?" He asks quietly.</p><p>Agatha chews on her bottom lip and her foot shakes back and forth, debating how much to share. In the end, she decides she has nothing left to lose. </p><p>"Betrayal comes to mind after all the curse words," she admits, looking away.</p><p>"Makes sense," he nods, "He was your mate, someone you trusted."</p><p>"A stupid decision," Agatha scoffs.</p><p>"Why?" </p><p>Agatha stares at him like he's an idiot, "Because I'm here."</p><p>"Did you think this was where your marriage would end up?"</p><p>"No of course not," she scoffs.</p><p>"Then why call your decision stupid if you didn't know?"</p><p>"Because I should have known," Agatha growls, frustrated that he doesn't seem to grasp her reasoning.</p><p>"What should you have known?"</p><p>"That he was a liar, the epitome of his designation in all the wrong ways. My best friend met him once, just one time, and she told me to dump him," Agatha huffs.</p><p>"But you trusted him, he must have done something to earn that trust."</p><p>"Yeah, he lied," Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p>"You know that now, but you trusted him then. You can't expect yourself to have known he would lie to you. That's what liars do, they make you believe what isn't true."</p><p>Banner leans back in his chair and smiles sadly, like he speaks from experience. </p><p>"It's his fault he lied to you, Agatha, not yours."</p><p>Agatha bites on her thumbnail and stares off into the middle distance. Damn him, she's been talking much more than she anticipated and now she's here, fighting down the urge to cry. </p><p>"If it's his fault then why do I feel stupid?" </p><p>"You were deceived, it happens," Banner holds out his hands.</p><p>Agatha sighs heavily and rolls her eyes, "And it cost me my life as I know it."</p><p>"That's not a certainty, though," Banner points out.</p><p>"Isn't it?" Agatha snaps. "At the end of this, I become a vegetable. I lose everything about me that makes me who I am. Pretty costly deception."</p><p>Banner concedes, "How do you feel about it?"</p><p>"I've made some videos," she admits. "Talking to myself mostly. I started a last will and testament, too."</p><p>"I'd probably do the same thing," Banner nods. "How does preparing for it feel?"</p><p>"It gives me something to do," Agatha answers absently. </p><p>"Is there anyone else helping you prepare these things?"</p><p>Agatha shakes her head and Banner studies her curiously, "Why not?"</p><p>"It would...upset them," Agatha chooses her pronouns carefully. </p><p>"Do you know why?"</p><p>"Because they still think there's a way to fix it."</p><p>"But you don't?"</p><p>Agatha shrugs, "I don't have that kind of luck."</p><p>Banner pauses and seems to contemplate something. Choosing which path he wants to pursue and which to leave for another session. </p><p>"So you don't want to talk to them about this because it would upset them that you're preparing for the worst?" He clarifies and Agatha nods.</p><p>"They want me to push back and resist but it's like trying to punch a tidal wave," she explains. "I can't fight against the inevitable."</p><p>Her voice catches on the last syllable and Agatha holds her breath until her throat relaxes and her eyes stop burning. </p><p>She hates the sympathy in the doctor's eyes and the look of understanding because it's what she's wanted her whole life from her mother, from Ralph, and it's given to her so easily by a relative stranger that she resents both of them more, realizing the extent of the damage they've done to her.</p><p>Was it really that hard to give her a bit of grace or was that a lie too?</p><p>She knows the answer.</p><p>"Maybe not," Banner murmurs thoughtfully, "But you <em>can</em> decide who will stand with you."</p><p>"It sounds like you might have some people you care about who would want to," he guesses, "Might be worth a shot before deciding to go it alone."</p><p>Agatha hums non-commitally, "Maybe."</p><p>Banner shrugs, "Think about it." He motions to the clock on the wall and smiles kindly. </p><p>"We're out of time for today but I'd like to make an appointment to see you next week. Sound okay?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes cut to the gold hands on the clock, surprised at how quickly the time had gone and glances back at the doctor. </p><p>"...Okay," she agrees.</p><p>Banner nods and they both stand as he sees her to the door, holding it open.</p><p>"Just remember, the decision is yours. See you next time."</p><p>"Next time," Agatha nods and leaves, exiting toward the waiting area, her eyes drawn immediately to the alpha sitting in the corner, expression neutral as she scrolls on her phone, reading something intently. </p><p>Agatha's scent must reach her because the next second, Rio looks up and catches sight of the omega and her face lights up, completely transforming when she smiles and her eyes crinkle in the corners. </p><p>Agatha's heart swells and she answers with her own grin as Rio practically bounds up to her, stuffing her phone in her pocket and stopping just shy of reaching for Agatha.</p><p>"Ready to go?" She asks and Agatha nods, following her to the elevators.</p><p>"How did it go?" Rio asks while they wait.</p><p>"Well, I have another appointment next week," Agatha mumbles and catches Rio grinning in the corner of her eye. </p><p>Their elevator arrives and both women step inside the empty car. Rio waits till the doors close before leaning closer to whisper, "I'm proud of you."</p><p>Agatha hums and glances at the alpha.</p><p>"Thanks, Mom," Agatha teases and Rio smirks, leaning as close as she dares, knowing there are cameras in the elevators. </p><p>"Would you prefer 'good girl'?" Rio purrs and Agatha's stomach flips and she shoots the alpha a glare.</p><p>"Absolute menace," she grumbles under her breath as the elevator dings, depositing them on the ground floor.</p><p>"That wasn't a no," Rio sing-songs, following Agatha out toward the parking garage in the late evening light. </p><p>Agatha shakes her head as they walk to the car and buckle themselves in before Rio starts the engine.</p><p>"Go through the drive thru again, I want an iced tea," she directs when they pull out into traffic. If she's going to therapy then she gets to reward herself. </p><p>"Good idea," Rio agrees with a smirk, "Gotta keep your energy up."</p><p>Agatha's forehead falls into her hand and she shakes her head, "You're ridiculous."</p><p>-------------</p><p>If Rio thinks back, she had a feeling something was off when the LED headlights kept shining in her rear view mirror after leaving the drive thru, blinding her a few times until the SUV falls back on the highway. </p><p>It's a few minutes and fries into their drive when Rio notices the same SUV creeping up on them when she changes lanes. Rio narrows her eyes and keeps glancing in her mirrors, tracking the SUV and other cars around them. </p><p>She might be worrying about nothing but her gut is unsettled and she needs to be sure. </p><p>Rio pulls off at the next exit citing gas as a reason when Agatha looks at her in question. </p><p>They stop at a stop light and the SUV is two cars behind them. Rio checks the GPS on her dashboard to find a nearby gas station and purposefully doesn't use her blinker when she merges to the right at the last moment to make the right hand turn. </p><p>Agatha gives Rio a side-long glance but says nothing.</p><p>Rio glances in her driver side mirror. </p><p>The SUV is one car away.</p><p>Rio slows when she nears the parking lot of a mini market attached to a gas station and turns into the mostly empty lot, her eyes glued to the SUV who turns in after her, now blinding her with LED headlights once again.</p><p>The alpha squints against the glare and bypasses the parking stalls, heading toward the opposite street exit. </p><p>"What are you doing?" Agatha finally asks, noting Rio's strange behavior and the obvious shift in her scent.</p><p>"I think we're being followed," Rio replies tersely and presses her foot on the gas pedal to cut into traffic, speeding up as she cuts over again. </p><p>The SUV behind them speeds up and taps their bumper, making the car shake as both women are thrown forward slightly. </p><p>"Yup, definitely being followed," Rio quips, stabilizing the wheel and making a hard right and speeding up to try and put some distance between them and the other car.</p><p>Agatha braces herself with one hand on the dash and the other against the shoulder of Rio's seat, trying to look over her shoulder at the rapidly approaching vehicle, her heart speeding up as adrenaline pumps into her system.</p><p>Rio grabs her phone and presses speed dial, the call echoing through the car speakers as Alice picks up after one ring, "Gulliver."</p><p>"Need assistance," she answers, her voice focused and tense, "Unmarked SUV, at least two occupants, in current pursuit, tried to run us off the road. I have Agatha in the car."</p><p>"Turn on your tracking," Alice replies, jumping immediately to help her partner. </p><p>Rio speeds around traffic, weaving in and out of lanes as other cars brake and honk in surprise. She reaches over the dash and presses a few buttons on the touch screen.</p><p>"It's on," she nearly shouts and there's a brief pause over which Rio and Agatha can only hear the sound of the engine roaring.</p><p>'Come on, come on, come on,' Rio chants under her breath, trying to lead the car away from more populated areas.</p><p>"Got you," Alice confirms, "Local PD on the way, I'm heading to you. Weapons?"</p><p>"Unknown," Rio barks, "But they haven't shot at us at least."</p><p>"Keep it that way," Alice barks back and Agatha thinks she can hear a note of concern in the alpha's voice.</p><p>Rio looks in the mirror and Agatha's eyes widen as she looks ahead.</p><p>"Red light!"</p><p>Rio swears and downshifts and pulls the hand brake, the car drifting into a hard left and just missing the bumper of another car. She straightens out and steps on the gas again, wheels screaming against the pavement as they speed down another street, Agatha looking behind them searching for any sign of help as the SUV gains on them again down the straight shot of road.</p><p>The car surges forward when the SUV hits their bumper again, causing them to fishtail to the left and Rio leans into it, crossing the median and pulling a U turn into the opposite street, taking off again in the opposite direction. </p><p>"Alice!" Rio shouts.</p><p>"Twenty seconds!" The alpha shouts back.</p><p>"Fuck," Rio grinds her teeth together, her hands sweating against the steering wheel, eyes darting between the road, her mirrors, and the GPS. She needs to keep moving, if they crash or get run off the road, Rio doesn't know what will happen next, whether the SUV will stop or simply drive away. She's also hoping to catch one of these fucks alive for questioning so while she does want to lose them, she needs to keep them interested.</p><p>"I see you on the map!" Alice shouts, "Blind turn at an intersection coming up, slow it down, three cars waiting for you."</p><p>"Got it," Rio changes lanes and steps on the brake, enough for the SUV to catch up and tap their bumper again, jostling both women in their seats. </p><p>"What the hell are you doing?" Agatha shouts at her; she can see the intersection coming up and stares at the alpha's profile. </p><p>"Trust me," Rio says shortly and Agatha has no choice as Rio slows again and the SUV hits their bumper just as they pass the intersection. Marked police vehicles appear from the blind corner and flank the SUV and Rio hits her brakes hard, forcing the SUV to slow and allowing the cops to pin the vehicle from all sides as they exit with weapons drawn at the driver and passenger, shouting commands to put their hands out the window.</p><p>Rio draws her own weapon and exits the car, pointing her firearm at the windshield, reaching for her badge with her free hand to identify herself to the swarming officers.</p><p>Agatha sits in the passenger seat, fully turned around to watch the scene, panting and shaking from adrenaline. She doesn't recognize either man they pull from the vehicle as they wrestle them face down on the asphalt. </p><p>More cars pull up and Alice jumps from one of them along with other agents as the arrested men are loaded into cars and the agents begin talking with the officers and processing the scene. </p><p>As Agatha looks around, she notes that bystanders have their phones out and people are starting to stare and she ducks down in her seat, not wanting to be caught on camera by accident. </p><p>The officers begin to branch out and create a perimeter around the scene, pushing the crowd back and directing traffic as the street is cordoned off with plastic barriers.</p><p>Rio jogs back to Agatha's side of the car, "We gotta get you checked out and out of here. Soon as the EMTs arrive Alice is gonna take us to a motel. We can't get a car until tomorrow."</p><p>The alpha looks back at the crunched back of the car; her eyes are bright and alert and body fidgety, clearly just as jumpy as Agatha. The omega can only nod and unbuckles her seat belt.</p><p>The EMTs arrive and do a once over on Rio and Agatha and Rio sends a message to Dr. Banner to let him know and they leave the scene behind with Alice, driving back toward town to a motel and dropping them off to return back to scene. </p><p>Rio checks them in and gets a room key and with their limited possessions, they're quickly settled in, both of them standing in the small space between an old television and dresser and a queen size bed. </p><p>Rio tosses her wallet and her firearm onto the bedsise table and pulls off her jacket like it's constricting her. Agatha can see the extra energy coming off of the alpha in her restlessness and twitchy movements. </p><p>"You okay?" Agatha asks tentatively as Rio's hands clench and open. </p><p>"Yeah," Rio breathes, "Just a little hyped up. Usually after an arrest Alice and I will interrogate but..." </p><p>Rio trails off and Agatha can hear the implied '<em>but I'm here</em>' missing from the alpha's statement and she ducks her head, feeling a bit guilty.</p><p>Rio cups her face and lifts so that she can see Agatha's eyes, "Are <em>you</em> okay? No headaches, blind spots? Anything?"</p><p>Agatha shakes her head as her mind runs through the whole thing again and the corner of her mouth turns up.</p><p>"You're insane, you know that?" Agatha half-scolds, half-laughs, swatting at Rio's chest. </p><p>Rio's eyes sparkle and her arms drop to Agatha's waist, "Certifiable."</p><p>The alpha surges forward with anxious energy and kisses Agatha. It's a little sloppy, and Rio bumps against her teeth before getting it right. </p><p>Agatha can feel the transfer of energy igniting her own left over adrenaline and she matches Rio's fervor, untucking the alpha's shirt from her slacks. She brushes Rio's hands away when she gets too rough with Agatha's blouse.</p><p>"This is all I have to wear, you're not going to rip it," she scolds, unbuttoning it quickly and draping it over the dresser. </p><p>Rio's slacks come off first and she gets halfway through unbuttoning her shirt before she says 'fuck it' and grabs Agatha by the waist and turns her toward the bed, flattening her palm between the omega's shoulder blades and pressing until Agatha bends over the edge of the bed. </p><p>"Shirt is good enough," Rio growls and pulls both pants and underwear down to Agatha's knees. She isn't quite ready for her cock yet, so Rio swipes her fingers against the omega's cunt and purposefully releases her pheromones to blanket over Agatha's senses and trigger her arousal. </p><p>Agatha's groan is muffled against her arm as Rio's fingers play her expertly, doing everything she remembers Agatha likes to make the other woman feel as desperate as Rio does. </p><p>Rio's impatience gets the better of her and she unzips her slacks just enough to release her cock from the confines of her underwear. She grasps the base of it and rubs it between the lips of Agatha's cunt, barely gathering enough of the omega's arousal before she pushes against her entrance.</p><p>Agatha gasps and pushes herself up onto her hands, hissing at the sting as Rio stretches her too quickly but she fights the reflex to try and escape forward, enjoying the pain as her cunt floods with desire. </p><p>Rio only gives her a few seconds reprieve before rocking her hips back and pushing forward again, her hips hitting Agatha's ass hard enough that she lurches forward, nearly losing her balance. </p><p>"Okay, baby?" Rio leans over Agatha's back, dropping kisses against the bumps of her spine and Agatha's head rolls forward on her neck.</p><p>"Yeah," she breathes, her body warming at the new endearment.</p><p>"Keep going," Agatha whines, "Hurts so good..."</p><p>Agatha's words hit something dark deep inside the alpha and she bites down on Agatha's shoulder, making her howl when teeth bruise her skin, leaving a false mark. </p><p>"You like it when I use you like this?" Rio thrusts her hips forward in a punishing pace and Agatha cries out loudly. </p><p>Rio flattens her body over Agatha's, pushing her into the bed with her weight. She grasps Agatha's chin and shoves two fingers into her mouth, effectively gagging the omega.</p><p>"Usually I'd let you scream but we should be considerate guests," Rio speaks low against the shell of Agatha's ear as she moans and chokes around Rio's fingers, rocking her hips back to meet Rio's thrusts now that the alpha's cock is drenched in the omega's slick.</p><p>"Oh fuck," Rio moans and buries herself to the hilt, resting all of her weight on Agatha as she wraps her free arm around the other woman's chest, trapping her arms as well.</p><p>"You want to come?" Rio asks, pressing her fingers against Agatha's tongue, reveling when the omega starts to suck without thinking. </p><p>Agatha nods, eyes closed and face flushed, her hair spilling onto the bed beneath them. </p><p>"Then move your fucking hips for me, baby, show me how much you want it."</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha's moan vibrating against her fingers as she starts to grind back against the alpha as much as she's able. It's not nearly enough but Rio savors Agatha's desperation.</p><p>"Just like that," she praises, groaning when Agatha's cunt squeezes her.</p><p>Rio pulls her fingers from Agatha's mouth, leaving the omega panting, and reaches under Agatha's hips to seek out her clit, using her wet fingers to rub tight circles over the swollen bud.</p><p>Agatha cries out and her legs start to shake, Rio showing her no mercy as she ascends quickly toward her orgasm, crashing headlong into it, her cunt pulsing in waves as she comes, body jerking against Rio involuntarily. </p><p>Rio doesn't let up, she stands up straight again and pulls Agatha's hips up, and starts the rhythm again, chasing her own release as Agatha's cries grow tortured, just on the edge of too much as a plaintive edge strains her throat when she cries out.</p><p>Rio's strokes grow erratic as she fights to concentrate and keep her fingers moving against Agatha as she finishes with a loud cry, swelling and spilling inside Agatha's cunt just as another sharp climax shoots through Agatha's body as she jerks her hips away from Rio's fingers.</p><p>"Too much, too much..." she breathes, "I can't," Agatha gasps for breath as she pleads and trembles, her insides melting as she drops down and writhes against the bed, whimpering through the aftershocks of her climax as Rio splays a hand against her lower back; steadying her with a comforting touch. </p><p>Their breathing is the only sound for a while until Rio recovers enough of her strength to pull out of Agatha. Her energy is gone, adrenaline used up fucking the omega and now she can feel the weight of exhaustion in her bones. </p><p>Rio helps Agatha up and puts her pants aside when she steps out of them, removing her own shirt and pants and folding them on the dresser, leaving her in her underwear and bra.</p><p>Her weariness and the pleasant buzz running through her body makes Rio clingy and she nuzzles Agatha's neck and hair, running her hands over the omega's body, squeezing and massaging relishing in the feeling of skin against skin and all the places she's allowed to touch.</p><p>Agatha hums and wraps her arms around the other woman as she attempts to burrow into Agatha's neck.</p><p>"My alpha," Agatha murmurs and Rio tightens her hold. </p><p>"Yours," she confirms, pressing her lips to Agatha's neck. </p><p>Rio grows heavy the more comfortable she gets and Agatha nudges her toward the bathroom to at least clean up a bit before falling into bed. </p><p>The alpha keeps at least one hand on Agatha, never more than a couple feet away, climbing into bed with the omega when they're done and curling up behind her. </p><p>"I got you," Rio sighs and Agatha laces their fingers together against her stomach.</p><p>"I know," Agatha whispers back.</p><p> </p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It's early morning when Agatha's dreams take a turn. She doesn't remember what she was dreaming about before but her point of view shifts and she's back in the padded hospital bed.</p><p>She's talking but no one seems to notice, trapped in her mind, only able to observe and listen, like a passenger in her own body.</p><p>She can feel the IV in her arm and a blood pressure cuff that tightens automatically every so often and the ever-present beep of a heart monitor.</p><p>Agatha tries to shout but despite her straining, nothing happens.</p><p>A person appears in her line of sight but they're close enough that she can only see their scrubs, neck, and a diamond flower pendant centered by a pearl.</p><p>Agatha tries to speak to them but they fit an oxygen mask over her face and Agatha gasps awake, her eyes flying open as she pants, not recognizing her surroundings and sitting up quickly before her mind catches up and memories from the previous night flood her consciousness.</p><p>Rio shifts next to her, her arm dislodging when Agatha sits up abruptly, "Hm? S'time?"</p><p>Agatha pushes her hair out of her face and blows out a breath, checking the bright digital clock plugged in next to the television.</p><p>"Five," Agatha whispers, laying back down on her side, facing the drowsy alpha.</p><p>"S'wrong?" Rio mumbles, subconsciously shifting until her head rests on the edge Agatha's pillow, seeking out her scent.</p><p>"Just a memory," she whispers, letting Rio's legs tangle with hers.</p><p>The memory itself isn't terrifying, in fact, it's one of the more innocuous ones; but with every recovered memory Agatha feels like she's living it for the first time and that is more of a shock to her system than anything.</p><p>Rio mumbles something else that Agatha can't make out with the alpha's face half buried in the pillow.</p><p>"Shhh," Agatha whispers, tucking Rio's dark hair behind her ear.</p><p>"Sleep, I'm here," Agatha subconsciously releases her pheromones, calming and lulling Rio back to slumber as Agatha watches over her, eventually falling back asleep herself for a few more hours before they're forced from bed by an alarm.</p><p>The rude electronic beeping and the lack of readily available coffee make Agatha grumpy; the omega going non-verbal until they dress and walk to a nearby diner for burnt coffee and rubbery eggs.</p><p>A few hours later, Alice arrives with another car for them and they drop her back off at headquarters before heading back to the cabin.</p><p>Agatha feels more at ease once back in a familiar place and settles down after a shower, a change of clothes, and a better cup of coffee. She needs to charge her phone so she retrieves her glasses and uses her laptop to check emails.</p><p>Rio changes and hops on to her own laptop, getting updates on the interrogation and any new information they might have found. Rio works from the couch while Agatha is perched on the dining room table, easily within sight as they work together but separately.</p><p>Agatha takes the leave that Lilia originally offered her, letting her know the situation is more serious than she originally thought which is true but...Agatha is also terrified to be on a call or in a meeting and suddenly go blank or have an episode, deciding to save herself the humiliation.</p><p>She's in the process of transferring her cases and clients to others within the firm. As her work decreases, Agatha throws herself into preparing for the furture. Anything she can think of to give her some semblance of control, Agatha will try, down to putting together a fat lawsuit against the company for a nice payout to help secure her long term care.</p><p>When she isn't putting together a case, Agatha takes to recording video journals of her thoughts when Rio isn't around and other times she buries herself in emails to arrange logistic details.</p><p>Sometimes she thinks about starting a journal but she can't imagine it would be very interesting. She probably won't be able to read it anyway.</p><p>Agatha opens an email from her divorce attorney, mildly surprised to realize she hasn't heard from her in a while, but with Ralph not responding to the petition for divorce, there hasn't been much to talk about for a few weeks.</p><p>As she reads, a mixed feeling of relief and anguish settles in her stomach as she bites on her thumbnail.</p><p>Rio is so attuned to Agatha by this point that she looks up, sensing the change in her scent, "What's up?"</p><p>"I'm divorced," Agatha replies simply.</p><p>"Like officially?" Rio asks curiously and Agatha nods.</p><p>"The deadline to respond passed. Judge granted a no fault divorce," she explains.</p><p>"It's over."</p><p>Agatha's scent is still conflicted so Rio puts her laptop aside and walks over to Agatha, dropping her chin to the omega's shoulder and wrapping her arms around her from behind.</p><p>"What are you thinking?" Rio asks, pressing a kiss to Agatha's temple.</p><p>Agatha takes off her glasses and tries to settle on a thought to share but they all carousel through her mind at once, fighting for precedence.</p><p>She hasn't 'belonged' to Ralph in some time; even before Agatha left their home she had already started to pull away. Her biological unmating feels like a lifetime ago but even after, there seemed to be the smallest of threads keeping her connected to him like sticky spider webs.</p><p>This feels like a bigger thread falling away, the last legal thing that keeps her tied to him, severing them in the eyes of the law.</p><p>Agatha is free.</p><p>She can testify against him; she can make him answer for what he's done to her.</p><p>Her memory of their relationship pushes to the forefront, playing back in her mind like a slide show: the first few dates, their first kiss, the first time they made love, introducing him to her mother, the relief she felt when Evanora had approved, late nights partying with their friends, introducing him to Jen, their first trip together, meeting his Midwest parents, his proposal, their wedding, the moment he claimed her, whispering assurances of forever...</p><p>Agatha hates her traitorous mind, why would she choose now to remember the times they were happy when it ended in flaming disaster? Why, when Rio is so clearly better for her in every way?</p><p>Tears well in her eyes and she feels guilty mourning her marriage when she has Rio's arms around her. It feels like a betrayal on her part and it's only a matter of time before Rio realizes it too.</p><p>Agatha blinks rapidly to disperse the moisture in her eyes and leans forward, reaching up to peel Rio's hands away.</p><p>She turns in her chair and offers Rio a tight smile, "I'm glad it's over."</p><p>Rio furrows her brow, confused by the sudden emotional wall she encounters; wanting to reach for Agatha but stopping herself, sensing she might be pushed away again.</p><p>"Are you?" Rio asks cautiously, trying to decipher the conflict between Agatha's scent and the words coming out of her mouth.</p><p>"Why wouldn't I be?" Agatha snaps, eyes narrowing at the other woman.</p><p>Rio stands steadfast, unfazed by Agatha's defense as her eyes soften, "It's okay if you're not."</p><p>"Don't do that," Agatha can feel her defenses rising at what she perceives is pity.</p><p>"Do what?" Rio asks patiently.</p><p>"Don't say 'its okay' when it's not. When it clearly isn't fair to you," Agatha says grimly, standing and retreating to the kitchen area under the guise of making another cup of coffee.</p><p>Agatha is still running, Rio observes, but at the very least she hasn't fled far and Rio considers that progress.</p><p>"What isn't fair to me?" Rio presses from afar, trying to maintain the delicate balance of getting Agatha to talk and letting her control her space to feel comfortable.</p><p>Agatha fixes the filter and loads the coffee grounds, pressing the start button to begin brewing, "Is this some kind of humiliation kink I don't know about?"</p><p>Rio remains silent, not rising to the deflective bait or reacting to the sting of Agatha's barbed tongue.</p><p>Agatha's agitation grows at the lack of response; she continues flippantly, "Totally fine if it is, of course, I'm not gonna yuck your yum."</p><p>She opens the fridge with more force than necessary and grabs the almond milk, "Hell, I'll even play into it if you want, which one would you prefer? Sad divorcee crying over her ex-husband to her current fuck buddy or angry, vengeful bitch who can't stop comparing the past relationship to the present?"</p><p>Agatha has trouble unscrewing the cap on the milk with the way her hands shake so she puts it down and grabs the edge of the counter, cursing her weakness and using it to fuel the hurtful words that fly like spears from her tongue.</p><p>"Or you can just wait until I forget everything and start brand new, pretty sure she'd be a good lay," Agatha sighs harshly and Rio growls.</p><p>The alpha has had enough; Agatha speaks so quickly and her jabs at Rio are double-sided, cutting into herself with the same vicious intent that Rio recognizes is guilt masquerading as anger.</p><p>She moves quickly to Agatha's side, placing one hand on the kitchen island and the other on the opposite counter like shes bracing herself to endure the earthquake of Agatha's tantrum.</p><p>Agatha can smell the smoky edge to her scent as Rio's eyes bore into her profile with glaring agitation and Agatha reconsiders if Rio is bracing...or if she's holding herself back.</p><p>"Stop," Rio growls and Agatha tenses involuntarily, her omega obeying out of instinct.</p><p>"First of all," Rio grinds her molars together, her nostrils flaring as she huffs, "Don't ever call me your 'fuck buddy' again."</p><p>Agatha whips her head to the side, getting caught in the intensity of Rio's gaze, the alpha commanding her attention with ease.</p><p>"You and I both know this more than that. Second," Rio pauses, gathering her thoughts, "If you want to cry about your ex-husband it's fine. If you can't stop comparing that relationship to what we have well...it probably isn't healthy but what else have you known?"</p><p>"Why do you think it's unfair to me?" Rio continues, frustrated that she doesn't understand.</p><p>"Because he's your ex? Because you loved him? So what? I <em>know </em>why he's your ex. You're allowed to talk about him."</p><p>"You say that like you aren't bothered," Agatha growls, abandoning her flippancy.</p><p>"I am, but not for the reasons you think," Rio snaps back.</p><p>"I'm angry he did this to you," Rio shakes her head and clarifies, "Actually, I'm furious."</p><p>"You loved him and he did this to you. I'm not angry that you loved him, that's natural. I mean what the fuck, Agatha, you should be cold and cruel. I've met your mother and Jesus fucking Christ..." Rio builds up steam, seemingly venting what she's been keeping inside for a while.</p><p>"I'm not trying to be a dick but I thought I had it bad, at least I have my mom..." Rio runs her hand through her hair and Agatha winces, that one hurts but she deserves it, she thinks.</p><p>A pain pierces the base of her skull and Agatha grimaces and shuts her eyes, gripping the counter and hissing through her teeth.</p><p>
<em>For the first time in a long time, Agatha wants her mother. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Where is Evanora?" She pleads.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ralph pets her hand and hushes her, "Shh, we'll see her later, honey."</em>
</p><p>
<em>It's a primal instinct to reach for her parent; a cord that's nearly impossible to sever and one that hurts so deeply because she knows Evanora won't come. </em>
</p><p>
<em>But Agatha doesn't know what else to do.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Mother," Agatha croaks again.</em>
</p><p>"<em>She'd be so proud of you, sweetheart..."</em></p><p>Her vision gradually goes white, like someone messing with the brightness of her computer screen until eventually she simply fades out, a high pitched singular note the last thing she hears.</p><p>For a moment Rio thinks she's gone too far, watching Agatha's face contort with pain, but when Agatha's hands drop to her side, her scent fades away and Rio's stomach swoops with dread. She leans to the side, confirming the pupils in Agatha's eyes have disappeared, swallowed by the blue and settling into a neutral expression.</p><p>Rio curses under her breath, she can't help but immediately blame herself; she had pushed the omega after all, she should have known better and after the jostling in the car, and sex...</p><p>"Fuck," Rio swears again, running both hands through her hair and trying to collect herself enough to make a plan of action.</p><p>She runs back to the couch for her phone and dials Dr. Banner's number, keeping an eye on the other woman in case she snaps out of her blank state.</p><p>"Banner," he answers after the second ring.</p><p>"I need your help, doc," Rio starts shakily.</p><p>"Go ahead, Agent Vidal," The doctor is immediately concerned and Rio is grateful to have his assistance.</p><p>"Agatha blanked out again," she blurts out, not bothering to try and put it in any technical terms, "We were...talking, it wasn't an argument but she was definitely upset...then she just sort of winced in pain and then...nothing. She's just standing there."</p><p>Rio takes a breath and lowers her voice, "Is this because of the car chase? Should I have brought her in?"</p><p>"Breathe, Agent Vidal," Banner reminds her kindly. "You said the EMTs cleared her to leave the scene?"</p><p>Rio nods before she remembers he can't see her, "Yes."</p><p>"Did she display any signs of disorientation, headache, nausea, pain?"</p><p>"No, not that I saw," Rio takes a breath in through her mouth. If she inhales, her alpha will panic, unable to make sense of how the omega can be right in front of her but some how not, in the absence of her scent. It's like seeing a ghost, or maybe more appropriately, a zombie.</p><p>The living dead.</p><p>Why would anyone want this?</p><p>"Wait," Rio stops herself, "I think she remembered something the morning after, but she was responsive."</p><p>Banner pauses on the other line and Rio can hear him typing, most likely making notes as she talks.</p><p>"Do you think you'd be able to bring Agatha here? It would be wise to do a scan, just in case," he asks.</p><p>"Would she be safe to travel?" Rio asks hesitantly.</p><p>"I'm afraid in this case we may need to take the risk," Banner replies with sympathy.</p><p>"Does Agatha have a power of attorney?" He asks.</p><p>"I'm not sure," Rio answers, "She...she hasn't really talked to me about that," she confesses.</p><p>There's a longer pause and Banner hums curiously. Before she can ask, he speaks again, "Then the decision lies with you, Agent Vidal."</p><p>Rio is technically in charge of Agatha, having been assigned to surveillance and protection but it's a different feeling when Agatha is unaware. This feels...wrong, unnatural. It's too much control to give someone but her only other option is to wait the episode out for however long it might go and Rio isn't too proud to admit she's out of her depth.</p><p>"Okay," she agrees, "Can you have a team meet us at intake? I'll let you know if she snaps out of it before we get there."</p><p>"Will do. Good luck, Agent Vidal. Let me know if I can help at all," Banner is typing again and Rio says her goodbyes and hangs up, trying to figure out what she needs to do.</p><p>Agatha has been standing and staring without moving the entire time and Rio sidles up to her and touches her arm.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio calls her name and the omega turns to stare at Rio who shudders uneasily at her blank eyes.</p><p>"We're gonna go see Dr. Banner, okay?"</p><p>The other woman doesn't respond and Rio's stomach turns uncomfortably, like she might be sick.</p><p>"Can you sit on the couch and wait for me?" Rio scans Agatha's expression for any minute twitch of recognition or understanding but nothing happens.</p><p>This is new.</p><p>Rio's brow furrows; she thought the drug made omegas obedient? Is Agatha fighting the effects?</p><p>"Agatha, go sit on the couch," Rio tries again.</p><p>This time, Agatha listens, walking casually to the couch to sit; facing forward and staring at nothing, waiting for further direction.</p><p>Commands, Rio realizes. She only responds to commands.</p><p>She hates this. Rio wants to rip her hair out; everything about Agatha that she cherishes is gone; replaced by a stranger. She misses Agatha's voice, her snark, her laugh, her stubbornness...</p><p>Rio turns away and sprints up the stairs, taking them two at a time and packing an overnight bag and some toiletries for them both. She can always get more things in town if needed but she searches for something Agatha can have that means something...something physical she can hold on to but Agatha left everything of sentiment in the house she left behind.</p><p>The closest thing she can think of is her worn Quantico shirt, packing it just in case.</p><p>Agatha is still sitting where Rio left her and Rio ducks her head to speak to her, "Put on your shoes and get in the car."</p><p>Rio follows Agatha out when she stands, watching her carefully for any imbalance, but Agatha doesn't falter and moves perfectly through the requested actions, sitting in the passenger seat with quiet poise.</p><p>Rio's gut churns and she has to take a breath through her nose and out her mouth.</p><p>It's too easy, Rio thinks. Agatha questions nothing. No concern for her safety or destination; just absolute obedience. A myriad of dangerous scenarios run through Rio's mind, all ending with Agatha being taken advantage of in the worst ways and her alpha howls mournfully, determined to prevent that from happening ever again.</p><p>Rio climbs into the driver's seat and starts the car, giving Alice a heads up and turning on their tracking.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The ride over is thankfully uneventful and Rio is pretty sure she's pissed off more than a few other cars as she rides the speed limit and avoids potholes, but she doesn't give a damn.</p><p>She's more worried what will happen if Agatha regains awareness while they're in the car.</p><p>Turns out her anxiety is for nothing when Agatha remains firmly in her trance-like state.</p><p>As promised, Banner and his team meet Rio at the entrance with a wheelchair, and Rio puts the car in park to help get Agatha into it, explaining what she's learned to Banner and telling him she'll be back as soon as she parks the car.</p><p>He tells her they need to sedate Agatha and get her into an MRI and lets Rio know where to find them.</p><p>Rio departs quickly, feeling guilty and anxious every minute she's away from Agatha.</p><p>She trusts Dr. Banner, but he doesn't know the little things about Agatha that Rio does; he doesn't know how to make her feel better when she's freaking out and she can only hope Agatha doesn't wake when she isn't there, worrying about how scared the omega might be if she wakes up alone in a hospital.</p><p>By the time Rio catches up to Banner and his team, Agatha is already in the process of getting an MRI so Rio waits in the observation booth, staring at images she can't comprehend but know means something to the medical professionals around her.</p><p>"You need to take out the IV before she wakes up," Rio advises Banner absently.</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"Take out the IV before she wakes up," Rio repeats, "Otherwise she'll take it out herself. You'll terrify her."</p><p>Banner nods, "Got it. She should only need it for a short time."</p><p>Rio presses her lips into a tight line, not thrilled about the necessary evil but she has no choice but to endure it.</p><p>When Agatha is moved to a room, Rio follows and makes sure they take the IV out of her arm before the nurses leave them alone.</p><p>Agatha sleeps for the most part and Rio breathes a sigh of relief, thinking it's better than her sitting and staring at nothing in bed.</p><p>Rio takes a seat on the available chair and prepares to wait.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Hours pass, nurses check Agatha's vitals periodically but she continues to sleep, reclined in the bed.</p><p>Rio is never too far away, leaving only to grab a coffee from the vending machine, too afraid to leave Agatha alone for any longer than that in case she wakes.</p><p>It's late in the evening and Rio is face down on the mattress near Agatha's legs, napping with her head pillowed in her folded arms.</p><p>She's pulled from sleep when she smells citrus blossoms, her alpha subconsciously rousing her and coming to consciousness when she hears sniffling.</p><p>Rio's head shoots up and she blinks hard to force her eyes to focus.</p><p>"Agatha," she calls out of reflex and the omega lifts her head from her hands and reaches for Rio who climbs into the bed without hesitation.</p><p>The top half of the bed is raised in a seated position so Rio fits herself behind Agatha so she can lean back and pull the omega against her chest, burying her nose in Agatha's hair to seek out her scent.</p><p>"You're okay, you're safe," Rio assures.</p><p>She tips Agatha's head back, relieved to see her eyes are back to normal and her expression, though tortured, is hers.</p><p>"Where are we?" Agatha asks, her voice small and unsure, breaking Rio's heart.</p><p>"We're in the hospital, Dr. Banner has been treating you," Rio explains.</p><p>She doesn't want to overload Agatha with information so she waits for Agatha to ask, answering her questions when she asks what happened and how she got to the hospital, and how long she was gone.</p><p>"About five hours. It's the longest episode you've had," Rio finishes, swallowing heavily and licking her lips anxiously. Both of them understand the unspoken: she's getting worse.</p><p>The silence lingers between them, charged and full of fear, neither woman knowing what to do as they're faced with the reality of Agatha's situation.</p><p>"Um," Rio breaks the silence, "Dr. Banner asked if you'd assigned anyone power of attorney."</p><p>Her leg wants to shake; nervous energy builds up in the alpha's body with nowhere to go so she rubs her hands up and down Agatha's arms and back.</p><p>"I told him I didn't know, I didn't even think to ask if you have anything like that..."</p><p>Because Rio still has hope this can be fixed, Agatha thinks to herself.</p><p>All of her preparations have been outside of Rio's purview in an effort to protect the alpha from anguish. Agatha knows eventually she'll have to break Rio's heart but it's happening much sooner than she thought; just like everything else, she thought she had more time.</p><p>"It's Jen," she croaks, and Rio looks at her in surprise.</p><p>"Jen has power of attorney if I...if I'm not able to decide for myself," Agatha explains. "There's an official last will and testament on my computer."</p><p>A small part of Rio hurts to hear that Jen is in that position but it makes logical sense, Agatha trusts Jen to carry out her wishes.</p><p>A larger part of Rio hurts because why didn't Agatha tell her?</p><p>"Anything else?" Rio's voice cracks. She knows Agatha well enough by now to know she wouldn't have stopped at just power of attorney.</p><p>"There are instructions. Things in place for when it's time," Agatha tries to phrase things euphemistically in an effort to gently ease Rio into the reality they both now face but Agatha can feel the rapid beat of Rio's heart and hear her labored breath. She should know there's no gentle way to break a heart.</p><p>"Are you giving up?" Rio chokes on her words, losing the battle to control the distress in her voice.</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes; she feels like a villain despite her lack of control over the circumstances.</p><p>"I can't fight the inevitable," Agatha says as softly as she can, repeating the words she'd told Dr. Banner.</p><p>Agatha can smell the torment coming off of Rio in waves and her omega reacts automatically, releasing her own calming pheromones to console the alpha.</p><p>"Please don't give up," Rio whispers reluctantly, like she's forcing herself to speak. Agatha knows Rio; she knows the internal struggle she's going through, trying not to be selfish but unable to give up what she's found.</p><p>Agatha recognizes it because she feels the same way.</p><p>"I'm not giving up," Agatha opens her eyes to find Rio's glassy stare, tears staining just under her lashes.</p><p>"I'm choosing you," Agatha lifts a hand to cup Rio's cheek.</p><p>"Whatever time I have left, I want to spend it with you."</p><p>Rio's face crumples when she starts to sob and Agatha wraps her arms around the other woman's waist.</p><p>"I know, I'm so sorry," Agatha whispers.</p><p>She can feel Rio's tears falling into her hair; triggering her own as they both cry, releasing some of the tension lingering between them.</p><p>Rio wants to rail and tantrum and beg Agatha not to go. She hasn't felt desperation like this since watching her father come centimeters from taking her mother away. Now, instead of her father, she faces the unknown; Agatha's fate is unfeeling and immovable, no amount of begging will stop it.</p><p>So she cries until her eyes are red and swollen and burning, clinging to Agatha like she could disappear at any moment.</p><p>Rio knows the depth of her connection to Agatha goes beyond what they've already established. She knows the name of the feeling that overtakes her heart and steals the breath from her lungs but to name it now, to give it life only to kill it before it takes its first breath...it feels cruel.</p><p>"I'll take whatever time you offer," Rio hiccups through her tears, pushing the words past her constricting throat.</p><p>Agatha lays her head over Rio's chest, listening to her heartbeat, her calming scent filling the hospital room, clashing with the alpha's sorrow and fear.</p><p>Rio doesn't know how long it takes for her tears to slow but by the time they do her knees and back hurt and she needs to wipe her face, her cooling tears making her skin sticky and tight.</p><p>Agatha gives her space when she wiggles out from behind the omega and grabs the hospital box of tissue, putting it on the rolling tray for both of them before sitting back down on the edge of the bed.</p><p>"Are you still angry?" Rio asks after a while once their tears have been wiped away.</p><p>Agatha is immediately concerned, trying to recall what Rio is talking about.</p><p>"About the divorce," Rio clarifies.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head as if doing so will help her memories slide into place; before blanking out, Agatha remembers talking about her divorce and vaguely insulting the alpha and her immediate concern becomes whether or not Rio is resentful.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Agatha replies reflexively, spurred on by the sensitivity of the raw emotion flowing between them.</p><p>"I didn't...I felt terrible. I thought I would be happy once I got the divorce," Agatha looks down at the crumpled tissue in her hands.</p><p>"I'm relieved but I started thinking about Ralph and... and all the times I loved him and it feels like I'm doing something wrong," Agatha inhales shakily, steadying herself.</p><p>"You've done so much for me..." Agatha trails off guiltily and Rio covers her hand with her own.</p><p>"You don't owe me anything and I definitely don't want you to police your thoughts because of me," Rio speaks softly, rubbing her thumb over Agatha's wrist.</p><p>"Part of you still loves him," Rio points out, hoping Agatha doesn't interpret her statement as an attack.</p><p>"It's <em>fine</em>," she insists, cutting the other woman off when Agatha opens her mouth to protest.</p><p>"I'm not angry with you for thinking about him and I'm definitely not going to be upset if you're not celebrating your divorce."</p><p>"I'm not jealous of your past, not when I have you now," Rio squeezes her hand, "Let me be here for you. Please."</p><p>Dr. Banner's words echo in Agatha's mind, <em>You <b>can</b> choose who stands with you.</em></p><p>It seems selfish to ask Rio to stay but the alpha is Agatha's match when it comes to stubbornness, refusing to leave her side; returning again and again when Agatha shoos her away just to bask in her attention, so Agatha decides to let her stay.</p><p>Besides, she doesn't have it in her to deny Rio her request.</p><p>Agatha nods and Rio leans forward to press her forehead against Agatha's. She should be calling a nurse to tell them Agatha is awake and responsive but she can't help but steal little bits of time knowing there is only a precious amount left.</p><p>Besides, the nurse will check on her again soon; they can find out then.</p><p>"So," Rio brushes her nose against Agatha's, attempting to lighten the mood, "Since you're single," she offers a playful but sincere smile, "You think I have a shot?"</p><p>Agatha scoffs, "The bar is incredibly low."</p><p>If anything, Agatha thinks she's the one who should worry about having a shot. She's an older, divorced and previously mated omega. Rio is younger than she is, single, incredibly attractive, successful and an alpha.</p><p>"You and Jen," Agatha sighs, "I don't know why you both hang around."</p><p>"Well, not sure about Jen, but I can think of many reasons to hang around," Rio leans forward and pecks Agatha's lips, smiling when Agatha chases after her for a longer kiss, making her stomach flutter.</p><p>Rio stomps down her excitement before it can ignite the kindling into full blown arousal, pulling away before either of them go any further.</p><p>"I should be more careful with you," Rio murmurs, smoothing her hand over Agatha's hair.</p><p>"If you start treating me like glass, we're gonna have a problem," Agatha threatens lightly.</p><p>"Maybe not glass," Rio concedes, "But definitely somewhere between bubble wrap and a helmet."</p><p>Agatha pinches Rio's leg and she laughs, "We'll find a compromise," the alpha promises, though she can't resist one last jab.</p><p>"It can be a purple helmet," Rio chuckles.</p><p>Agatha wrinkles her nose in disgust, "Ugh, that sounds like a euphemism for your dick."</p><p>Rio snorts in amsuement, "Bubble wrap it is, then."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"Will you tell me what you've planned already?" Rio asks quietly, her voice retreating from its playful tone and adopting a more serious note.</p><p>"Yeah, if you want," Agatha drops her eyes bashfully and leans back against the bed.</p><p>The alpha nods and laces her fingers with Agatha's.</p><p>"I do."</p><p> </p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Conversations with Jen and a special delivery.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It's time for Agatha to tell Jen.</p><p>Now that she's awake, Dr. Banner checks in with her, detailing the deterioration in her scans and confirming what Agatha already knows.</p><p>He suggests Agatha stays for at least 48 hours for observation just in case another episode occurs. As he explains, Banner makes it clear that while the episodes don't seem to be inherently harmful, they leave Agatha in a vulnerable state and considering the ongoing investigation, he expresses his concern for her safety.</p><p>Rio suppresses her offense, knowing that his concern isn't anything to do with her capability but her alpha still bristles at the idea of not being enough to protect the omega.</p><p>Banner assures them that it isn't something he's going to push for but to keep it in mind considering the progress of Agatha's condition. And now that her power of attorney is known, it's time to loop in Jen to cover their legal bases.</p><p>She decides to call the other woman instead of having her visit the hospital out of caution.</p><p>It's early evening, hopefully Jen is already off of work. Rio gives her the room, letting Agatha know she'll be in her office a building over if needed, the omega urging her to take a break</p><p>The phone rings twice before Jen picks up.</p><p><em>"Harkness,"</em> she practically purrs and Agatha smirks.</p><p>"Jen," she greets back, "Got a minute?"</p><p><em>"Depends,"</em> Jen hums, <em>"I can charge you my hourly fee or you can tell me why your agent is sending me flowers, the correct ones at that."</em></p><p>Agatha can hear tapping on the other end and pictures Jen tapping her finger around a glass of wine.</p><p>She blushes, feeling like they're back in their dorm room in grad school and her fondness for the other omega surfaces.</p><p>"It was a thank you," Agatha answers vaguely and she can practically feel the glare Jen gives from across town.</p><p>
<em>"So after the first five minutes I discount depending on the length of consult-"</em>
</p><p>"Okay, fine," Agatha huffs. Jen would <em>absolutely </em>send her a cash app request if she doesn't confess.</p><p>Agatha fidgets with the edge of the Quantico shirt she wears.</p><p>"Rio and I are," Agatha hesitates, unsure exactly what they are now that she's confronted with naming it.</p><p>"Together," she settles for a broader term.</p><p><em>"Oh my god you fucked,"</em> Jen nearly squeals and Agatha lowers the volume on her phone.</p><p>"Jesus fucking Christ," she hisses, more upset about the shouting in her ear than Jen's crude words.</p><p><em>"Yeah I bet,"</em> Jen snickers.</p><p><em>"So, wait, why is Rio sending me-"</em> Jen gasps like she just found the cure for cancer.</p><p><em>"You rocked her fucking world didn't you?"</em> Jen starts to fake cry, <em>"Oh my god I'm so proud!"</em></p><p>"I fucking hate you," Agatha groans, her heart lighter than it's been in days. She wants to hold on to this feeling, knowing that once she tells Jen everything, the same ominous cloud that hangs over her life will extend to encompass her best friend.</p><p><em>"Lie better,"</em> Jen scolds. <em>"So is this a courtesy call to let me know you're adopting two cats and getting a Subaru or what? Or are you waiting for the divorce?"</em></p><p>"Divorce was granted. No fault," Agatha tells her.</p><p><em>"I knew I was having a good week for a reason,"</em> Jen quips.</p><p>
<em>"So now once the Versa case is over you can ride off into the sunset in your U-Haul and have little social justice babies."</em>
</p><p>Agatha grimaces and bites her bottom lip. Jen would be such a good aunt. She would probably teach a child to swear and drink milk out of a wine glass but she would love them so well.</p><p>"I have to tell you something," Agatha's voice drops.</p><p><em>"I was just kidding, please don't tell me you're pregnant,"</em> Jen rushes out and Agatha laughs sadly. If only. That would be the easier to deal with than the reality.</p><p>Agatha launches into the story, telling Jen what she is able without compromising the case.</p><p>Jen is silent through all of it; unusual considering Jen would usually be asking a thousand questions by now. It's the first time she's ever rendered the other woman speechless and she would celebrate if the news weren't so glum.</p><p>Agatha tells her the details of her plans including Jen's position as power of attorney should she suddenly, or eventually when, Agatha becomes incapacitated.</p><p><em>"Email me what you already have,"</em> Jen instructs when Agatha finishes, her voice flat when she finally breaks her silence.</p><p>"That's it?" Agatha asks in disbelief, confused by Jen's reaction.</p><p><em>"What do you want me to say?"</em> Jen snaps and Agatha is taken aback.</p><p>She forgets sometimes that she and Jen are cut from the same cloth; sarcastic and calculating, and quick to anger when emotions begin to overwhelm.</p><p>"I don't know! Do you even want to be my power of attorney?" Agatha snaps back.</p><p>It's their language; only able to be vulnerable under the guise of caustic remarks, both of them not healed enough from past trauma to speak with any softness.</p><p><em>"Don't be stupid, of course I do,"</em> Jen huffs.</p><p>"Then what the fuck is your problem?" Agatha pushes, familiar with the irritation building in her chest.</p><p><em>"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have anything prepared for 'my best friend is the target of a trafficking ring and by the way, she's gonna forget who the fuck you are because her shitty ex-husband was born instead of swallowed'!"</em> Jen shouts, getting louder the longer she rants.</p><p>"That's not my fault!" Agatha protests.</p><p><em>"I fucking know that!"</em> Jen argues.</p><p>"So why are you yelling!?"</p><p><em>"Because it's not fucking fair!"</em> Jen is on the edge of hysterical and Agatha backs off, recognizing her best friend's limit.</p><p>"I know. I fucking know, okay?" She sighs.</p><p>Agatha can hear Jen's breathing on the other end of the call; punctuated by an occasional sniffle.</p><p><em>"Can I kill him?"</em> Jen sneers.</p><p>"You know what? If the trial fails, sure," Agatha scoffs.</p><p><em>"Remember you said that when you're sitting in jail with me,"</em> Jen threatens.</p><p>"I'm not gonna remember anything, you're on your own," Agatha chuckles.</p><p><em>"Bitch,"</em> Jen grumbles.</p><p>There's a longer pause between them; Agatha would assume the other woman hung up if she couldn't hear Jen breathing and moving around every so often.</p><p><em>"Where are you?"</em> Jen asks finally.</p><p>"Can't tell you," Agatha says sadly and Jen scoffs.</p><p>
<em>"Figures."</em>
</p><p><em>"You better keep me updated,"</em> Jen demands.</p><p>"I will," Agatha promises.</p><p>
<em>"I'm serious."</em>
</p><p>"So am I."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha has another episode of blanking out the next day, thankfully only lasting an hour this time but it's the first time it happens without Rio around to help.</p><p>Rio had taken the day to work in her office at Agatha's insistence and Rio had agreed only if Agatha let her bring her lunch so they can eat together, the alpha unable to go the whole day without seeing Agatha at least once to quell the worry that builds the longer she's away.</p><p>It's takes the nurse about five minutes to notice that Agatha's scent has disappeared and that she's become unresponsive, easily missed in the busier hospital environment.</p><p>Banner assigns a nurse to Agatha's room both for observation and for safety though it's a boring assignment for the nurse when Agatha remains seated and staring until she blinks awake, jarred when she realizes she's not alone.</p><p>An embarrassed blush rises through her face and she avoids looking at the nurse when she asks her a standard set of questions and has her complete simple movements like picking up a pencil to confirm her mental and physical competency.</p><p>It's all very clinical and Agatha resists the urge to call for Rio, chastising herself for being needy; she certainly wasn't like this before and Agatha half-blames Rio when her omega whines like an addict in withdrawal.</p><p>Dr. Banner stops by to check on her vitals and tells her he would feel more comfortable letting her leave if she doesn't have an episode in at least twelve hours to which Agatha agrees knowing she's going to check herself out either way, hitting her limit with being in the hospital.</p><p>Her day gets mildly better when Rio arrives with lunch. The baba ganoush and falafel clashing oddly with the smell of fall that Rio produces naturally.</p><p>They share the rolling tray table, Rio snapping playfully at Agatha's hand when she steals a fry.</p><p>"One of our would-be attackers broke today," she informs Agatha who perks with interest.</p><p>"Someone really doesn't want you to testify," Rio continues, "He won't give up a name, says he doesn't have a contact, just instructions."</p><p>Agatha snorts; she can guess, especially with the judge granting her divorce but without any solid evidence or testimony it's all conjecture so she keeps it to herself though she's positive Rio is thinking the same.</p><p>"Though we might be able to get more out of him. Turns out, someone forgot to tell them a federal agent was in the car and he wasn't very happy."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes; the idiocy only confirms her suspicions.</p><p>She tells Rio what Dr. Banner told her emphasizing that she would rather be in the cabin than in the hospital.</p><p>After lunch, Rio returns to her office with promises that she'll be back in the evening which is another sticking point for Agatha. With the hospital room bed and the more public setting, Rio can't comfortably stay with her overnight.</p><p>She's either going to be relegated to the uncomfortable chair or a small cot Alice provides when Rio's grumbling gets the better of her.</p><p>Agatha spends the afternoon recording more videos and catches up on the news and her emails.</p><p>A cold wave of anxiety washes over her when she catches up on news about the Versa case. Photos of Ralph, Paul, George, and Ron are plastered under headlines of arrests and speculation of their level of involvement.</p><p>So far the details of the drug trials and the circumstances of Kelly's death are only vaguely referenced but there are enough articles that anyone who knows her would be able to connect the dots.</p><p>Another article covers a "high-speed chase involving the FBI" accompanied by vertical phone footage of the arrest; police cars and bright lights starbursting on the screen. Luckily her face doesnt appear in any clips she can find and her name doesn't appear, simply referenced as a "witness" to the case which but it's enough to make Agatha uneasy.</p><p>She preemptively blocks her mother's number, just in case.</p><p>Evening arrives and with it, Rio and dinner.</p><p>Agatha had gone the rest of the day without an episode, encouraging them both that she'll be able to leave soon.</p><p>When Jen calls, Agatha doesn't think twice about it, having sent her the paperwork the other woman requested earlier in the day.</p><p>"You know you can leave work at work right?" Agatha greets when she accepts the call.</p><p><em>"There's a package at my apartment for you,"</em> Jen cuts right to the point.</p><p>Agatha goes on high alert and Rio picks up on the change in her scent, putting down her fork and wiping her mouth with a napkin.</p><p>"Did you open it?" Agatha questions.</p><p><em>"I'm not stupid,"</em> the omega scoffs, <em>"I saw your name and called you."</em></p><p>"Hang on," Agatha lowers the phone and turns to Rio.</p><p>"Jen just got a package with my name on it, delivered to her apartment," she informs her and puts the phone on speaker when Rio gestures.</p><p>"Jen? It's Agent Vidal," Rio moves closer to talk into the phone.</p><p><em>"Evening agent, sorry to interrupt anything important,"</em> she quips.</p><p>"Not a problem, you have my full attention."</p><p>
<em>"Ooh hear that, Agatha?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha smirks despite herself. Jen is nervous, her sarcasm gives her away, a natural defense to hide her true feelings.</p><p>Rio smirks then falls into her professional training, "Have you touched the package?"</p><p>
<em>"Damn, I mean I have experience but..."</em>
</p><p>"Jen," Agatha scolds.</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> Jen answers.</p><p>"Okay," Rio speaks calmly though Agatha can see the tug of a smile on the corner of her mouth.</p><p>"Is there anything on the outside of the package? Dust or any kind of film?"</p><p><em>"Doesn't seem like it,"</em> Jen replies.</p><p>"No sounds coming from it?" Rio checks.</p><p><em>"Silent as a grave,"</em> Jen replies.</p><p>Rio nods, "I'm going to send my partner and few agents to you okay? Don't touch the package and wait in a separate room. My partner will identify herself if you're nervous. Her name is Alice Wu-Gulliver."</p><p>The alpha is confident and assuring and even Agatha is calmed, comforted by the quick and decisive action that no doubt is a result of training and job experience.</p><p><em>"My very own agent, must be my lucky day,"</em> Jen deadpans.</p><p>Rio has her phone out, making a call to Alice while Agatha jumps back on the line.</p><p>"Do I need to cash app you money to make this up to your roommates?" Agatha sighs.</p><p><em>"Hmm, I'm never going to say no to extra cash but Teddy and Maria are fine. They owe me for intimidating the landlord into lower rent under threat of litigation,"</em> Jen muses.</p><p>"Using your powers for good?" Agatha scoffs.</p><p><em>"If you saw the rent spike you would have too,"</em> Jen argues.</p><p>Shuffling and knocking echo faintly on the opposite line.</p><p><em>"Feds are here, hope they don't find the drugs,"</em> Jen quips as Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>They say their goodbyes so the other omega can greet the agents at her door.</p><p>Agatha huffs in annoyance; she should have known Jen would be next. Unable to get directly to Agatha, the next logical step would be someone close to her and with Ralph's knowledge, he would know to pick Jen over Evanora.</p><p>The tense moments of waiting are difficult to overcome. Agatha can't really bring herself to continue talking about anything mundane so she remains quiet, waiting for the next update.</p><p>Forty five minutes later, Rio gets a notification that the package is on the way to be scanned and opened by the lab, the danger to Jen is minimal but Alice remains there on surveillance now that contact has been made.</p><p>Jen texts Agatha shortly after.</p><p>
<em>Scratch what I said earlier, it <b>is</b> my lucky day.</em>
</p><p>A candid photo, a little blurry and clearly shot from hip level, comes through; Alice pointing and talking to another agent, oblivious to Jen's antics.</p><p>Agatha snorts, "<em>Down, girl" </em>she types back and Jen replies with a smiling devil emoji.</p><p>At least someone is getting something out of this mess, Agatha muses.</p><p>"Hey," Rio taps Agatha's shoulder to get her attention.</p><p>The omega puts her phone down and gives Rio her full attention.</p><p>"They opened the package, it's a flip phone. Tech is gonna run it and make sure it's safe," Rio looks down at her phone, getting real time updates.</p><p>"They're gonna check for prints and go over cameras to see if someone dropped it off in person."</p><p>Agatha nods and Rio looks up to find her eyes, "Any ideas who would go through Jen?"</p><p>Agatha gives Rio a look, narrowing her eyes, "You know who."</p><p>Rio nods solemnly, "I know, I just have to check."</p><p>"Will Jen be safe?" Agatha asks with concern, folding her arms around her middle.</p><p>Rio nods, "Alice will stay to do surveillance and then they'll take shifts, if we need to, we can move her to a safe house."</p><p>Agatha grimaces and hopes it doesn't come to that. The idea of being a burden and disrupting Jen's life adds to the guilt on Agatha's shoulders though she finds its getting easier to bear, knowing Rio won't let her blame herself for long.</p><p>It's a couple hours later that two other agents arrive at Agatha's room. Agatha recognizes the short blonde omega, Belova, while the other agent, an alpha, introduces herself as Agent Bishop.</p><p>"No tracking or signal transmitters found," Belova tosses Rio the phone and the alpha catches it against her chest.</p><p>"Seems like a normal phone," Agent Bishop adds. "Battery is fully charged, but there's a voicemail waiting."</p><p>Rio looks down at the simple flip phone reminiscent of the 2000's and flips it open, the LCD screen brightening to a standard color swirl background.</p><p>The contacts and messages are empty and the phone has no app capability but as Agent Bishop said, there is a pixelated voicemail notification at the top of the tiny screen.</p><p>Rio goes to it and presses play, turning up the volume for all of them to hear.</p><p>
<em>"My you're hard to find.</em>
</p><p>
<em> But I never lose track of what's mine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Answer when I call. Your FBI friends can even listen in if they want. </em>
</p><p>
<em>If you don't...well let's say for Ms. Kale's safety you will.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Bye bye, Agatha."</em>
</p><p>The voice on the message is male but very clearly an AI voice, losing some of the human inflection without understanding the context.</p><p>Agatha can feel three pairs of eyes staring at her and she looks out the window, uncomfortable with the scrutiny.</p><p>Fuck him, Agatha thinks.</p><p>There's a desperation in his actions that threaten to escalate if he's ignored; the push back against the divorce, attempted break in, the SUV trying to run them off the road...</p><p>And now he's involving other people; if Rio is right and they don't want her to testify, Agatha must be a bigger threat than she first thought. Or maybe they're aware her memories are returning.</p><p>"Make a copy of the voicemail," Rio instructs, returning the phone to Agent Bishop.</p><p>"Then bring it back."</p><p>The two agents nod and leave quickly, urgency in their pace as they carry out their instructions.</p><p>Rio is on the phone with Alice seconds later to give her an update and Alice confirms she'll stay on surveillance at Jen's place as a precaution.</p><p>Minutes later, Agent Belova returns with the phone, leaving it with Rio and Agatha.</p><p>Agatha stares at the device on the rolling tray, not sure if she wants to be the one to hang on to it even though the message was clearly stated for her.</p><p>She feels like if she picks it up, she'll be sucked back in to the sticky web she just liberated herself from, but there is no way to know what he wants if she doesn't answer and she won't endanger Jen's life that way.</p><p>He's put her in another impossible place; herding her until she has no choice but to do what he asks. Agatha bares her teeth at the thought, she's tasted freedom and she won't go back.</p><p>She's smarter than him, of that she's sure.</p><p>"What do I do when he calls?" Agatha asks tentatively.</p><p>"Answer," Rio says simply. "Once we know what he wants we can go from there."</p><p>Agatha sighs and Rio gives her a tense sympathetic smile.</p><p>"I guess we're not leaving any time soon?" Agatha asks, disappointed.</p><p>Rio ducks her head, "Sorry."</p><p>Agatha sighs again and tilts her head back to stare at the ceiling. It's the first time she actually wishes to blank out, tired of the constant stress and hyper-vigilism that's haunted her life for months.</p><p>When she disappears it's like falling asleep; drifting until she's suddenly pulled above surface, not even realizing she had been unconscious the whole time.</p><p>The only blessing is that there are no memories and thus no pain.</p><p>It's just nothing.</p><p>Agatha blinks up at the hospital ceiling light and wonders if that's what death feels like, just...bigger.</p><p>Her thoughts take a dark turn and Rio's nose twitches, catching the heavy note of sadness in Agatha's scent as she looks over the way the omega's shoulders drop and her eyes grow haunted.</p><p>Agatha might be physically okay for now but emotionally she's deteriorating quickly.</p><p>"Let's go," Rio says after a moment and Agatha looks up in surprise.</p><p>"You just said-"</p><p>"I know," Rio cuts her off, "But you can't stay here. I'll let my team know we'll be in a hotel nearby."</p><p>"You're not going to get in trouble for this are you?" Agatha asks but based on the way she leans forward and her scent changes, Rio knows she's interested.</p><p>"Do you want to stay here?" Rio asks, picking up the duffel bag and turning to face Agatha. It's possible she'll be reprimanded but nothing as serious as a write up when there's a hotel two blocks away. Besides, Rio thinks, isn't it within her job description to keep the witness able to testify?</p><p>If the prosecutor wants to piss off their star witness then that's their prerogative; Rio, on the other hand, chooses peace.</p><p>"No," Agatha answers quickly, gathering what little she has with her and following Rio out, stopping to inform Dr. Banner's office of their departure, citing the patient's "mental wellness" as a concern and leaving the name of the hotel.</p><p>Agatha feels embarrassingly out of place in her casual pants and sweater as she walks with Rio, passing doctors and agents in suits on the way to the elevators while Rio makes a call to her director.</p><p>The call is mostly silent on Rio's end after her initial greeting and update and Agatha eyes her out of her peripheral, mouth tight and brow furrowed in concentration.</p><p>"Understood," Rio answers and hangs up, her expression losing some of its tension and Agatha suspects the alpha was just chewed out.</p><p>"Sure it's okay?" Agatha mutters in the empty elevator.</p><p>Rio presses her lips together, "He's not happy but sounds like Banner signed off on it so..." she shrugs.</p><p>Agatha hums, "Guess he's not terrible."</p><p>Rio smirks, "Glowing endorsement."</p><p>They leave the hospital and make the short drive two blocks to the hotel, checking in and heading straight for their room.</p><p>Despite not being in a familiar place, Agatha feels a hundred times better than in the hospital. Rio is right, she would have been increasingly miserable there, constantly reminded of her situation and stuck in her mind, replaying her mistakes over and over and driving herself mad.</p><p>In the absence of prying eyes, Agatha moves to Rio and wraps her arms around her shoulders, sighing heavily against her neck when Rio's arms circle her waist.</p><p>The closeness soothes some of Agatha's nerves as does the solitude. When she pulls away, Agatha removes the flip phone and puts it on the bedside table between the twin beds dressed in matching blue bedspreads. For a moment Agatha realizes she misses the guest room at Rio's house and even more so she realizes she's never actually slept in or seen Rio's bedroom.</p><p>It seems like such a trivial thing to think about but it's so oddly backwards when they've already slept together, lived together, and tiptoe around the deep well of feelings between them.</p><p>Agatha sits on the edge of a twin bed, Rio sitting next to her and crossing her legs.</p><p>"Do you think if things were different we would have dated?" Agatha ponders out loud.</p><p>"If you gave me the time of day, maybe," Rio smiles softly.</p><p>"What makes you think I wouldn't?" Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Gala," Rio replies.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "That was different, I was married."</p><p>"So you wouldn't have been instantly annoyed if you were single?" Rio prods playfully.</p><p>"I wasn't instantly annoyed," Agatha protests.</p><p>Rio smirks in disbelief, "What were you, then?"</p><p>Agatha thinks back to the gala, turning to face the woman attached to the sultry voice, large brown eyes dancing with mirth, her alluring smile and the red dress tailored to perfection like a second skin and above all, breathing in Rio's scent for the first time.</p><p>"Stunned," Agatha confesses.</p><p>It's clearly not the answer Rio is expecting when her playfulness wavers for a second for something more sincere.</p><p>"Then annoyed," Agatha adds and Rio's eyes drop into a glare though her smile stays in place.</p><p>"Maybe it's good we met like this then," Rio drops a kiss to Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>"You're still annoying," Agatha turns and nudges her nose against Rio's.</p><p>"What a compliment," Rio murmurs and presses her lips to Agatha's.</p><p>Agatha kisses her back slowly at first, chaste pecks that grow longer until Agatha deepens the kiss, tilting her head to slide her lips over Rio's, swiping her tongue against the inside of her bottom lip.</p><p>Rio hums and meets her with her own tongue, losing herself in the softness of Agatha's lips until her need to breathe forces her to pull away.</p><p>"I don't want to hurt you," she admits, smoothing her hand over Agatha's hair, cradling the back of her head.</p><p>"You won't," Agatha insists.</p><p>"No, I mean," Rio leans back to look at Agatha.</p><p>"I don't want to accidentally trigger an episode," she explains, "I didnt tell Dr. Banner we slept together after the accident and I wasn't exactly gentle..."</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to retort but Rio holds up a hand to stop her, "I know it's most likely the accident but the possibility is there and I feel kind bad about not telling Banner."</p><p>Agatha's stomach drops and she leans back a bit, putting space between them, anticipating a rejection. The part of her that cares for Rio, however, argues that she knows Rio is sensitive about her aggression harming someone else whether on purpose or accident; her rejection has nothing to do with wanting her.</p><p>"What would make you feel better?" She asks hesitantly.</p><p>"One more day?" Rio replies hopefully. She doesn't want Agatha to think she's deciding for her so instead the alpha provides a compromise.</p><p>Agatha exhales in relief. Her trust is atrophied like an under used muscle and to have her exercise it and pay off feels like a victory.</p><p>"Okay," she agrees and Rio squeezes her hand.</p><p>-------------</p><p>When they wake the next morning, crowded and cramped on one of the twin beds, the phone is still silent.</p><p>The battery is still fully charged but no notifications pop up, just the default screen background and the time.</p><p>They order in breakfast and more of Rio's team arrives to brief with her and give updates. They drop off a recorder for when the call comes through and Rio continues working from the hotel room while Agatha goes stir crazy twiddling her thumbs and flipping through channels on the hotel TV.</p><p>Luckily, or maybe unfortunately, Agatha doesn't blank out, experiencing every painful moment of boredom and though she has ideas about how to spend their time, she's trying to be respectful of their agreement.</p><p>She changes the channel again and settles on a cooking show.</p><p>Rio looks over in sympathy when Agatha sighs for the fifth time in an hour.</p><p>"Not exciting like the movies is it?"</p><p>"There are so many better ways to use my time," Agatha grumbles.</p><p>"Drama queen," the omega mumbles under her breath and Rio pauses, taking a break from her computer at the small desk and turning to face Agatha sitting on the bed.</p><p>"Who me or him?" Rio asks curiously.</p><p>Agatha smirks, "Both of you actually, but I meant him specifically."</p><p>Rio makes a face but gestures for Agatha to continue.</p><p>"Of course he'd want me to stop everything I'm doing just to wait for a stupid phone call," the omega explains.</p><p>'When we were together I thought it was <em>endearing </em>that he wanted my attention all the time," Agatha sneers, "Now I realize he was trying to keep my attention so I wouldn't look anywhere else."</p><p>"Was he your first?" Rio crosses her legs, resting an elbow against the back of the chair.</p><p>Agatha laughs under her breath, "No, he's just the one that lasted."</p><p>"Said all the right things, nice dates, gifts," Agatha waves her hand dismissively.</p><p>"Typical narcissist," Rio huffs.</p><p>The phone rings as if summoned.</p><p>Both women whip their heads toward the lit up LCD screen and Rio grabs the recorder and plugs it in to the charging port on the phone.</p><p>They stare at one another and Agatha has a brief moment of fear before she takes a deep breath, inhaling Rio's scent and flips it open to answer.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>There's nothing at first, not even background noise, then the same AI voice from before answers.</p><p>
<em>"Hello, Agatha."</em>
</p><p>Her body tenses, reacting instinctively to the perceived threat.</p><p>"Who is this and what do you want?" She demands.</p><p><em>"Always so straight to the point,"</em> the voice on the other end teases.</p><p>
<em>"How are you doing?"</em>
</p><p>"None of your business," Agatha growls.</p><p><em>"Don't be unkind, Agatha,"</em> the voice scolds.</p><p>
<em>"Just worried for your health, the headaches must be unpleasant but I'm sure someone will be there to wipe the drool from your chin when you're in hospice."</em>
</p><p>Agatha's blood runs cold and Rio's scent flares as she grinds her teeth together.</p><p><em>"They didnt tell you did they?"</em> The voice taunts, <em>"You die at the end of this."</em></p><p>"You're lying," Agatha replies breathlessly.</p><p><em>"You shouldn't have left,"</em> the voice ignores her and continues on, <em>"You lost your protection and you're going to pay for it."</em></p><p>"Then why call?" Agatha hisses.</p><p>
<em>"Because I have an offer."</em>
</p><p>The words ring in Agatha's chest and she searches out Rio's eyes, not sure what to expect.</p><p>Rio presses her lips together and nods, giving her encouragement to keep going.</p><p>"What is it?" Agatha grunts.</p><p><em>"An antidote,"</em> the voice replies and Agatha has to temper her hope with reality, imagining the offer could be a trap or a lie among other things.</p><p>"Go on," she prompts and though the voice is fake, Agatha swears she can hear the smug smile on the other end of the line.</p><p>
<em>"You agree not to testify and make a statement of your non-involvement in the case. We'll give you half of the antidote now, enough to stabilize you, and the other half after the trial, once your end is fulfilled."</em>
</p><p>Agatha's mouth goes dry, "How do I know you aren't lying?"</p><p>
<em>"What other choice do you have?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha says nothing, unable to argue.</p><p><em>"The offer expires after twenty four hours. Think about it,"</em> the voice continues.</p><p>
<em>"Have a good night. You too, Agent Vidal."</em>
</p><p>The line goes dead and defaults back to the main screen and Rio is instantly on the phone with her team to try and track the number and to send a recording of the call to tech.</p><p>Agatha can only sit with the phone in hand.</p><p>A chance to live a normal life, to wash her hands and walk away and leave this chapter behind; maybe even a chance to move forward with Rio.</p><p>If it's true and there's a way to reverse the damage, it's her one opportunity to try and save herself, otherwise...</p><p>Is she really going to die? Dr. Banner never brought it up; was he keeping something from her? Was Rio?</p><p>Agatha looks up at the alpha pacing on the phone in front of her. Her body is tense and a hand rests on her hip just over her badge. She seems agitated and restless and though her trust wavers for a second, Agatha decides to hold on to it for now.</p><p>But in the face of losing months of work on a high profile case, Agatha fears she'll be compelled to testify, facing subpoena and jail time, putting her life in danger all over again.</p><p>A handful of possibilities run through her mind, annoyed by the manipulation, leaving her with choices designed to make sure she loses in the end.</p><p>Agatha looks down at the phone again and imagines throwing it into the opposite wall but puts it back on the nightstand, knowing they'll need it later.</p><p>Instead she sits and shakes with anger; paralyzed by it, the urge to destroy and lash out blooming ravenously in her chest as she desperately seeks a target that isn't Rio.</p><p>With no other options, Agatha turns on herself, digging her nails into her legs painfully as the white fog starts to blur her vision.</p><p><em>No, </em>she thinks, <em>I don't want to disappear, not now.</em></p><p>Agatha doesnt realize that Rio has stopped talking, glancing at Agatha every so often to be sure she's alright; but when her scent dips, Rio ends her call and reaches for Agatha, grasping the sides of her head to look at her eyes.</p><p>Agatha is fading, her pupils shrinking and dilating as she tries to push back. Her hearing grows muffled like she's been pushed underwater, and her mind begins to float.</p><p><em>Rio</em>, she tries to hold on to a singular thought, directing all of her mental energy into focusing on the alpha's name.</p><p>"Stay with me," Rio murmurs, curling her fingers around the back of Agatha's neck. She wants to shake her, to physically break the hold Agatha is slipping under but nothing reaches her.</p><p>In seconds, Agatha is gone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<em>"NO!"</em>
</p><p>Agatha gasps back to awareness and tilts before jerking up right like she's trying to keep herself from falling; pain lances through the base of her skull and she presses her palms to her eyes to try and stop the throbbing behind them. The blood drains from her face and she breaks into a cold sweat.</p><p>Her inner omega is silent; disoriented and confused, Agatha feels like she's operating without half of her soul; like looking at her heart operating outside her body, her brain knows something is wrong but struggles to comprehend what is happening and how it's possible.</p><p>It feels unnatural to be disconnected from her instincts and nausea threatens to rise.</p><p>She moves without thinking, seeking a flat surface and sinking hard to the floor, forcing herself to roll onto her back so she can breathe.</p><p>Her eyes remain closed but her hearing returns; Rio's concerned voice is nearby and Agatha lifts a hand to try and stop her from speaking when the sound echoes too loud in her head. There's the faintest chirp of her omega returning, like a familiar silhouette in the foggy distance coming closer and Agatha breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>Fingers wrap around her hand and Agatha squeezes and takes a deep breath, pushing her lungs out as far as she can before she blows out through her mouth.</p><p>"Dizzy," she explains, regaining her bearings enough to open her eyes, squinting against the light.</p><p>Rio kneels over her, wearing the same pantsuit Agatha remembers and if she looks to the right, she can see the blue of a blanket from a twin bed. Not much time has passed, Agatha guesses.</p><p>Her head and neck throb but she doesn't feel like she might faint anymore so she pushes herself up on her hands as Rio helps her sit up to lean against the side of the bed.</p><p>"What happened?" Rio murmurs, keeping her voice low.</p><p>"I fought it," Agatha groans and draws her legs to her chest, dropping her forehead to her knees and pressing her hands against her temples, trying to alleviate the pain that feels like an ice pick to the her inner ears.</p><p>Resisting an episode feels like a hollow victory when all she wants to do is stab herself in the eyes because surely that would hurt less than her brain trying to birth itself through her skull.</p><p>Rio moves quickly and shuts off all the lights and closes the curtains on the windows. She grabs water and some painkillers, delivering them to the omega who takes them quickly, handing the glass back after a few sips.</p><p>Rio leaves the glass on the nightstand and bends down, "Do you want to stay here or move to the bed?"</p><p>Agatha's omega wants to pull down the blankets and pillows and make a nest between the beds to hide and heal but she refuses the urge when thinking about the effort makes her head pound harder.</p><p>"Bed," Agatha whimpers.</p><p>Rio nods and helps Agatha up, removing her shoes before tucking her into the covers.</p><p>The omega pulls the covers up over her face to try and block out more of the room while Rio sits next to her up against the headboard and threads her fingers through Agatha's hair to rub small circles against her scalp and neck.</p><p>"Is this helping?" Rio asks, stretching her legs out and crossing them at the ankle.</p><p>Agatha's response is muffled but she doesnt flinch away so Rio continues.</p><p>"A few agents are going to come by to pick up the recording, I'll talk with them in the hallway so you can rest," Rio hums.</p><p>Agatha makes a noise of affirmation and Rio leans her head back against the wall.</p><p>She doesn't know which is more upsetting, the episodes or the consequences of fighting against them. Agatha's scent is still all over the place but she's never actually seen the omega resist an oncoming episode and watching Agatha slide to the ground made her panic for a good minute, her blood pressure spiking until she realized Agatha was responsive.</p><p>Rio suspects a pattern of what triggers Agatha's episodes but it isn't concrete and she isn't eager to test it out either; but if Agatha gets agitated, if she stews, the stress could be triggering an overload.</p><p>Granted, she only has two solid instances to back up her theory but still, it's a thought.</p><p>When the painkillers kick in after an hour, Agatha falls into a light nap and Rio slips from the bed and meets the agents in the hallway as promised, letting the omega rest as long as possible before making one of the most consequential decisions of her life.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"I'm well aware of what's at stake but you can't ask her to give her life for a case," Rio growls, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>Rio feels like she's in a three way stand off with her Director and Dr. Banner, discussing the implications of the offer. Stuck between two agitated alphas, Dr. Banner looks uncomfortable but Rio cares little for his comfort when her alpha perceives a threat to it's chosen omega.</p><p>"How close are you to creating a reversal drug?" The Director asks Dr. Banner and Rio's eyes shift to the Doctor, who looks pained. Rio wishes he would take a side.</p><p>"Months," he answers honestly.</p><p>"She doesn't have that kind of time," Rio argues.</p><p>"And we may never get another chance," The Director shoots back.</p><p>"And if she refuses?" Rio raises an eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>Banner also seems interested in the answer, eyeing the Director.</p><p>The Director sighs, "I can't stop a judge from issuing a subpoena."</p><p>Rio bristles and Dr. Banner interrupts before Rio can respond, trying to diffuse the tension as the only omega in the room.</p><p>"I would advise against it, the FBI can provide evidence that testifying under stress would lead to witness deterioration as well as endangerment."</p><p>Rio huffs, feeling justified but the Director continues to push, "We've been providing protection and relocation. From what I understand you've done an exemplary job."</p><p>The Director stares at Rio and something behind his words make Rio's hackles rise and she resists the urge to bare her fangs.</p><p>"If the witness testifies, our teams can arrange for entry into witness protection," he adds and Rio imagines Agatha having to disappear somewhere halfway across the country, her alpha only interpreting the option as a threat of separation.</p><p>"Is that the best use of FBI resources?" Rio asks, sarcasm just edging into her tone.</p><p>The Director's scent flares and Rio tries to remember the chain of command despite her alpha's urge to challenge the other alpha.</p><p>"I can reassign you if that's what you're asking," The Director snaps and Rio bites her tongue, still quietly fuming but not willing to risk reassignment.</p><p>The Director stares at Rio with lips pressed into a thin line, "I'm aware of the...<em>personal</em> nature of your connection to the witness."</p><p>Rio feels a flush climb from her chest to her cheeks but she refuses to flinch, staring down the Director and presenting no denial.</p><p>There is a certain allowance society silently gives to alphas; the argument that the more "dominant" designation cannot help but indulge in their natural tendencies. Rio doesn't necessarily agree, but she will use it to her advantage in this case.</p><p>"But there are other factors to consider," The Director continues, "Not just months of work across multiple departments, but the victims waiting for their perpetrators to face justice."</p><p>Rio huffs, nostrils flaring, "She's a victim, too. It's too much to ask."</p><p>The alpha hates that Agatha is simply referred to as a "witness", like an asset. It feels like her usefulness outweighs her own victimization and Rio's alpha rails against the injustice.</p><p>"I didn't say it was an easy choice but I want you to make sure the witness understands the potential consequences," The Director replies evenly, leveling his gaze with hers to be sure the gravity of his words settle over the agent.</p><p>Rio grinds her molars together and offers the Director a sharp nod, "Understood."</p><p>Banner gives her a look of sympathy but she doesn't want it; glaring at him and turning on her heel, anticipating the dismissal and leaving before she says or does something that counts as insubordination.</p><p>Her drive back to the hotel is short and direct. She doesn't want to take any more of Alice's time, entrusting her partner to remain with Agatha while she is summoned to the Director's office.</p><p>While Rio knows the choice she would make, she can't help but feel guilty. Offers like these are always designed to benefit one side but gambling with Agatha's life is not something she's willing to compromise on.</p><p>When Rio returns she's immediately suspicious; Alice's scent is spicier, nervous, and Agatha wears a mischievous grin as the women face each other while sitting on opposite beds.</p><p>"Hi?" Rio interjects and Agatha's smile softens when she catches sight of Rio and Alice looks relieved, like she can't wait to get out of there.</p><p>Another round of painkillers after her nap had Agatha functioning enough to ignore the dull throb in her head while assuring Rio she would be okay without her for an hour and that she's comfortable enough with Alice if anything does happen.</p><p>But maybe Rio should have been more worried for Alice...</p><p>"Uh, everything okay?" Rio looks between the two women and Agatha shrugs.</p><p>"Girl talk," she explains vaguely and Alice offers no further explanation, avoiding Agatha's gaze.</p><p>"What about you?" Alice asks, clearly changing the subject.</p><p>"What did boss man have to say?"</p><p>Rio curls her lip in a snarl, "Quote, be sure the witness understands the consequences of her decision, end quote."</p><p>There, Rio delivered his message. He didn't tell Rio to lecture Agatha, though the undertones were clear, but strictly speaking she's done her job and she refuses to add to Agatha's guilt.</p><p>Alice wisely says nothing as Agatha's scent turns sorrowful and stands to leave, offering Agatha a shy nod and a small smile while making a hasty exit, giving the two women space to talk.</p><p>"You dont have to listen to what anyone says, you know that right?" Rio sticks her hands in her pockets and sways on her feet, restless and agitated.</p><p>"And ignore the consequences?" Agatha replies humorlessly, her attempt at sarcasm falling flat.</p><p>Rio might be willing to put months of work on the line for Agatha but Agatha is sure the same can't be said for all agents on the Versa case. She imagines there will be a few agents, and victims, with chips on their shoulders should she decide not to testify which makes Agatha wonder; does <em>Rio</em> understand the consequences of her decision?</p><p>Rio shakes her head, "Not ignore. Deal with."</p><p>Agatha can practically see Rio metaphorically digging her heels in and sighs internally. She bites her lip, warring with her familiar habit of choking down the truth of her worry, knowing she promised Rio she would try and tell her what she really feels, but old habits don't die easily.</p><p>Agatha detests how small her concern makes her feel and worse, how vulnerable it leaves her to Rio's judgement and whim.</p><p>She cares what Rio thinks of her; to the point Agatha is sure the alpha could break her with a single word of disapproval.</p><p>Agatha can only wonder if the alpha realizes how much power she holds.</p><p>Rio gives Agatha a few long moments to work through her thoughts; the omega's bitter lemon scent the only outward expression of her inner conflict.</p><p>The alpha watches as Agatha attempts to self-soothe, wrapping an arm around her waist and biting her nail, a sign she may potentially need some support to navigate her thoughts.</p><p>Rio removes her jacket and hangs it over the back of the desk chair before rolling her sleeves up and sitting on the bed, back against the headboard and legs crossed.</p><p>"What would make you feel better right now?" Rio asks quietly.</p><p>Agatha shifts her eyes to Rio, continuing to nibble on her thumbnail distractedly as she shrugs.</p><p>Rio lifts an eyebrow. She's both concerned and intrigued by this side of Agatha. The emotional damage done to her is clear and Rio's heart aches as old fractures expose themselves, buried long ago only to be exhumed when Agatha's foundations are shaken.</p><p>Watching Agatha try to work through her feelings, Rio can effortlessly picture the omega as a child, developing a threadbare patchwork of half-baked coping mechanisms to survive through trial and error with failure bringing severe punishment or retribution.</p><p>With nudging from her inner alpha, Rio tries again.</p><p>"Do you want to come here? I can hold you and we can talk," she offers and frowns when Agatha shakes her head in refusal.</p><p>Something tickles in the back of Rio's brain; like a hound catching a scent, Rio senses a puzzle as her determination rises a step.</p><p>"No? Did I do something?" Rio asks evenly, keeping her voice gentle but firm.</p><p>Again, Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>Rio wrecks her brain for why Agatha would keep herself at a distance if she isn't angry, going over what she knows about the omega.</p><p>Agatha retreats when she's overwhelmed and that overwhelm is usually stemmed in guilt, based on what Rio has already experienced.</p><p>"Are you worried about me?" Rio asks and this time Agatha nods.</p><p>Rio hums and puts together her next questions, "Are you worried about something happening or how I'll react?"</p><p>Agatha pulls both knees up to her chest and Rio tilts her head; Agatha is trying not to run, retreating into herself instead and the more Agatha retreats the closer to the truth she must be, Rio surmises.</p><p>"Both," Agatha whispers.</p><p>The corner of Rio's mouth lifts, encouraged as she lures the omega out like a timid animal.</p><p>"Okay, let's talk about them one at a time," Rio says steadily, purposefully releasing a wave of pheromones to entice and calm the omega.</p><p>"What do you think will happen?" Rio asks as Agatha fidgets uncomfortably.</p><p>"I don't want any one to be mad at you because of something I did," Agatha mumbles and Rio needs to lean forward to hear her properly but she's bolstered as Agatha starts to open to her.</p><p>That makes sense, Rio thinks; Agatha has been taught her actions are a reflection of both her mother and Ralph, using their disapproval as a way to control her choices.</p><p>"You think my team will blame me?" Rio clarifies and Agatha nods.</p><p>"They might be frustrated," Rio says honestly, "But this is our job. If all of it falls apart because we lose one witness then we didn't do our jobs right. We have other evidence."</p><p>Agatha's scent doesn't change and Rio frowns, reaching for Agatha's hand to tug her closer.</p><p>The omega tugs back at first but Rio's insistence and her pheromones as well as Agatha's own need drains the fight from her and she follows Rio's pull until she's seated sideways in the alpha's lap.</p><p>Rio's alpha rises the more submissive Agatha becomes, sensing her distress and unbalance and eager to make up the difference. Her alpha continues to alter her scent, not to pull Agatha from her submissive state but to allow her to sink into it and trust Rio to take care of her.</p><p>Agatha nuzzles her nose against Rio's neck, seeking out more of her smell, her instincts growing needy as Rio's pheromones coax Agatha gently toward surrender.</p><p>Rio wraps her arms around Agatha and rests her chin on the other woman's shoulder, "Talk to me."</p><p>Agatha whimpers, "I want to make you happy."</p><p>"You do," Rio assures, rubbing her hand over Agatha's back.</p><p>The omega's scent morphs and Rio can feel Agatha's pulse stutter at the smallest bit of praise and Rio latches on to it, using it to her advantage.</p><p>The alpha turns her head to press her lips to Agatha's ear.</p><p>"You're doing such a good job, sweetheart, keep going," Rio murmurs, making Agatha shudder.</p><p>"I don't want you to be mad at me," Agatha sputters quietly.</p><p>"Why would I be?" Rio presses and Agatha shifts in her lap and remains silent, her scent growing fearful.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio pushes a little harder, "Look at me."</p><p>Rio is aware she's pushing at Agatha's limits but she knows the omega is close to letting her defenses down, just needing an extra nudge to surmount her fear; the alpha prodding because she knows Agatha is safe with her.</p><p>It takes her a moment but Agatha lifts her eyes to look at Rio, eyes shining and intense and Rio can feel the weight of Agatha's heart in her hand.</p><p>"There she is," Rio grins warmly and a flush colors Agatha's cheeks as her pupils dilate.</p><p>"There's my good girl."</p><p>The pink in Agatha's cheeks darkens and spreads down her neck and she drops her eyes in embarrassment though her scent is a dead give away for how much she likes it.</p><p>"It's not for you to decide if I'll be angry or not," Rio says firmly, "But if I am, I won't take it out on you."</p><p>"You won't be angry now, but what happens three months later when the case is still ongoing?" Agatha argues shakily.</p><p>"Or if one of them flees the country? Or more victims appear?" Agatha adds.</p><p>"I don't want you to resent me," Agatha mumbles.</p><p>Rio smooths her hand over the back of Agatha's head, "I don't think I could resent you for choosing to live."</p><p>There's a pause as Agatha processes her words. Rio understands how choosing herself seems like a selfish choice. Agatha's past tells her there must be some kind of debt to be paid at a later date, whether literal or karmic, and she needs to be prepared to pay up when the time comes.</p><p>Rio, however, doesn't wish for payment.</p><p>She just wants time.</p><p>"Even with the cost?" Agatha asks like she can read Rio's thoughts.</p><p>"Worth that and ten times more," Rio assures.</p><p>If she's lucky, Rio will have a long career in the FBI. Versa will be one of hundreds, if not thousands of cases that cross her path in that time, eventually fading into the background of her memory to make room for more important information.</p><p>However, Rio knows with a certainty that comes from deep attachment that she will never find someone like Agatha again; no matter how many people she meets, Rio will recall every detail of the omega.</p><p>Agatha leans forward, tucking her head under Rio's chin and relaxing heavily against her. Rio kisses the top of Agatha's head, finally feeling at ease as the tension seeps from the omega's body.</p><p>"I'm proud of you," Rio whispers, "My good girl."</p><p>Rio smiles when Agatha huffs and grumbles, not used to genuine praise and struggling to accept it despite how much she longs for it.</p><p>"You are," Rio rubs her cheek against Agatha's hair, her alpha subtly releasing more of her darker woodsy scent, inviting the omega to follow and give in.</p><p>Rio can feel the puff of breath against her chest when Agatha starts to respond and gives her a moment to decide what she wants, idly caressing a section of wavy chestnut hair.</p><p>After a moment, Rio can feel Agatha's lips against her neck, pressing gently under her jaw.</p><p>Rio smiles against Agatha's hair, her hand dropping to her thigh and squeezing, "So good."</p><p>"You want to..." Rio trails off as Agatha hums and nods.</p><p>"Take your shirt and pants off and lie down," Rio whispers, pecking the top of Agatha's head before she lets her go.</p><p>Agatha pouts and whines and Rio grasps her chin lightly.</p><p>"None of that," she scolds gently, "I want to make you come, are you going to be good and let me?"</p><p>Agatha bites her tongue, the reward good enough to stay her sarcasm for the moment and nods.</p><p>Rio decides to push, "Words, Agatha."</p><p>The omega shoots her a brief glare, flexing the muscle in her jaw as her molars clench.</p><p>Rio slides her hand over Agatha's ass and squeezes, making Agatha's eyes flutter and spurring her to answer.</p><p>"I'll be good," she pushes out through a sigh.</p><p>Agatha pulls her blouse over her head and puts it aside, scooting off Rio's lap and pushing both her underwear and pants down and discarding them as Rio smirks.</p><p>"I won't say you're being naughty, but you're definitely getting cheeky," Rio chuckles and maneuvers Agatha until she's laying on her stomach, giving her a pillow to rest her head and arms.</p><p>Rio senses Agatha is nearing the end of her good behavior, not because she doesn't want this but it's simply in her nature; she'll obey, but she'll complain the entire time.</p><p>Just as Agatha opens her mouth to retort, Rio lowers her hands to Agatha's back, smoothing her thumbs over tight muscles, turning Agatha's remark into a sinful moan as goosebumps erupt over her skin.</p><p>Rio grins and her body warms; unable to resist the arousal that comes with the sounds Agatha makes.</p><p>She uses the tips of her fingers to dig into the small muscles on either side of her spine, stretching and massaging them until they're pliable and moving down to the next part of her spine to repeat the process.</p><p>Having Rio's hands on her skin makes Agatha's body buzz pleasantly and the firm pressure from Rio's fingers and palms only add to the gradually building desire even as she sinks into the mattress.</p><p>Rio's hands move methodically over her shoulders and back and finally over her ass and the backs of her thighs. She uses long strokes from Agatha's knee to just below her ass, massaging along her hamstring one leg at a time.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curl in the pillow and her breathing picks up; the anticipation doing more to drive her mad than Rio's touch at the moment.</p><p>Rio's sure thumbs travel down to her calves and Agatha hums, relaxing little by little until her body feels like lead.</p><p>"See?" Rio purrs, "Feels good doesn't it?"</p><p>Rio's hands move back up Agatha's legs, her thumbs dipping toward the inside of her thighs, moving higher with each pass.</p><p>Agatha shifts her legs apart and Rio gladly takes the invitation, rubbing her thumbs over her labia and pushing them apart to peek at the arousal coating her slit.</p><p>Using one hand to hold her open, Rio uses her other thumb to brush directly against her clit, watching her cunt clench around nothing as Rio and Agatha both groan in unison.</p><p>Rio does it again and Agatha's moan is muffled into the pillow.</p><p>"Good girl," Rio praises breathlessly, turning her strokes into slow deliberate circles, gathering her arousal until her thumb slides effortlessly across her clit.</p><p>Agatha claws at the edges of the pillow before she braces her hands on either side of her body to give her leverage to tilt her hips up toward Rio's touch.</p><p>"Do you want more?" Rio coos and Agatha nods immediately.</p><p>"Words," Rio reminds her.</p><p>"More," Agatha breathes and Rio leans down to place a kiss against the back of her shoulder.</p><p>"Turn over," Rio instructs, pulling her hand away to give Agatha room to do so while the alpha sheds her pants and underwear, working on the buttons of her shirt before Agatha stops her.</p><p>"Leave it on," she requests, eyes heavy and glazed over with need.</p><p>Rio smirks and drops her hands, climbing back on to the bed and parting Agatha's legs to fit herself between them.</p><p>"Think you'll be okay?" Rio checks, bracing her weight on one hand as she leans over Agatha and smoothes her fingers over her forehead.</p><p>Agatha nods, "I trust you."</p><p>Rio's eyes soften and she leans down to catch Agatha's lips, sighing happily when the omega responds in kind.</p><p>The alpha reaches between them to grasp her cock and align herself, pushing forward slowly as Agatha parts her legs further and cries out against her lips.</p><p>Rio swallows her every sound, dropping down to her elbows as her cock is swallowed by Agatha's heat, her hips cradled against the inside of Agatha's thighs.</p><p>It's only been a few days but Rio has missed the feeling of Agatha surrounding her and her alpha revels in the feeling of coming home.</p><p>Rio trails her lips down Agatha's neck to where her faded mark sits above her scent gland, drawing her tongue over it as Agatha keens, arching her back.</p><p>Rio refuses herself the urge to bite but she can't help but nibble and suck when Agatha cries out and clenches around her each time her teeth nip at her.</p><p>Rio sets a languid pace, dragging her cock against every surface of her inner walls before sliding forward again to fill her. She keeps her mouth against Agatha's scent glad, sucking hard enough to leave a bruise and send Agatha spiraling, her fingers clawing and pushing at Rio's shoulders and arms like she can't decide whether it's too much or just enough.</p><p>Her cunt floods with arousal and Rio slides in easily, her groan vibrating against Agatha's chest, pinching skin between her teeth and pressing her mouth down hard against gland and muscle as Agatha's eyes roll back and the tendons of her neck stand out in sharp relief.</p><p>Ragged moans fall from her open mouth as Agatha squirms beneath the alpha, jerking and writhing every time Rio's mouth presses down, teasing her omega until she's practically crying for release.</p><p>"Fuck me," she whines, rolling her hips to try and urge the alpha to move faster.</p><p>"I knew you could use your words," Rio breathes and Agatha can feel the stretch of her smile against her skin as the alpha obliges, quickening her pace until Agatha wraps her legs around Rio, locking them against her lower back as the alpha's cock hits just the right spot inside her.</p><p>"Oh, fuck!" Agatha shrieks and hooks her arms over Rio's shoulders as her eyes slam shut, clinging on to the alpha tightly and burying her face in Rio's hair, muffling herself against the slope of a shoulder as her cries rise in volume; so close to her release.</p><p>Agatha's wails border on sobs and with a few more strokes her cunt pulses and tightens as her entire body is wrecked with tremors and Rio moans against her ear, thrusting as deep as she can to draw out Agatha's climax.</p><p>Rio's muscles ache with use as she chases her own release, Agatha echoing her low moan when she spills inside, muscles tightening in her stomach with every spasm until she's entirely spent.</p><p>Rio's arms shake with exertion so she fits their legs together and rolls slowly until they're both laying on their side, wary of putting too much weight on the omega.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio pants, pulling her head back enough to see Agatha's face, relieved to see a hazy but normal expression in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha nods and licks her lips, still breathless, "You know, I might talk about my feelings more if you fuck me like that every time."</p><p>Rio chuckles, relieved that Agatha seems back to her normal self.</p><p>"Like a carrot on a stick?" She quips and Agatha smirks, resting her head against Rio's.</p><p>"Something like that."</p><p>They stay together that way for a while, parting when Agatha starts to get uncomfortable and needs to use the bathroom.</p><p>Rio follows shortly and turns on the shower, leaving the sliding door partially open in invitation, humming happily when Agatha's arms slip around her soapy waist.</p><p>They shower quickly and Rio wraps Agatha in a towel, holding out a hand to help her step over the raised ledge.</p><p>After they change, Agatha tugs Rio into bed, the twin mattress forcing Agatha to lay half on top of Rio as the alpha adjusts the covers, making Agatha's nesting urge rise again though she pulls it back, knowing she won't really be satisfied with anything she makes in a bare hotel room.</p><p>At least the small bed satisfies her need for closeness, letting herself indulge in the neediness that Rio seems to inspire.</p><p>Besides, the alpha doesn't seem to mind.</p><p>Rio wraps an arm around Agatha's back, rubbing absently and turning on the TV, content with the quiet peace between them.</p><p>Agatha has said what she needs to.</p><p>All that's left is to wait.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The follow up call comes right at the twenty fourth hour and just like before, Rio plugs in the recording device and hands Agatha the phone, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>Agatha nods and presses the green button to answer and another to put the call on speaker.</p><p>"You have a deal," she answers stone-faced.</p><p>"Good choice, Agatha," the AI voice greets her again and she scrunches her nose in disgust.</p><p>"I want you to know, if you try to screw me over in any way I'll make sure to make your life a living hell until my dying breath," she growls.</p><p>"That won't be very long if you try to pull one over on me as well," the voice almost sarcastically responds.</p><p>"Speaking of, you'll need to retrieve the vial I have here for you," the voice continues.</p><p>Rio's scent changes to one of tension and Agatha curls her lip.</p><p>"Where?" Agatha grunts.</p><p>"Shipping ports, a day from now. Eleven pm. You'll receive specific terminal directions an hour before."</p><p>Rio types furiously on her phone sending messages to her team and Director, automatically sending teams there to search for anything suspicious.</p><p>"No wires, no trackers, no agents, or the deal is off," the voice warns.</p><p>Agatha looks at Rio over the phone in her hand; she knows the alpha isn't happy about the terms and neither is she but they're forced to agree at least until they have more leverage.</p><p>"Fine," Agatha snaps.</p><p>"It's a date," the voice replies and hangs up as Agatha slams the phone shut and tosses it back on the nightstand in disgust.</p><p>Rio is on the phone, getting briefed with the rest of her team and hanging up once dismissed, stuffing the phone in her pocket.</p><p>"No agents, no trackers, no wires," Agatha repeats, looking to Rio in question.</p><p>"There are other ways, let us worry about the logistics, okay?"</p><p>Agatha nods, trusting Rio to come up with something to keep her safe.</p><p>He wants her alone and vulnerable, whether it's a mind game or a precaution on his part, Agatha isn't sure but she refuses to be helpless.</p><p>She needs to let go of the idea of justice for now and focus on survival; every step like a butterfly effect, branching out with multiple possibilities and fated paths that she can't access unless she survives.</p><p>And if she does, he has no idea how long she can hold a grudge. She might not testify but there has to be another way; Ralph is determined but sloppy, he'll fuck up at some point and when he does, Agatha will be there to cut him down.</p><p>"Think you can do it?" Rio asks, trying to gage Agatha's thoughts.</p><p>Agatha nods, "I have some ideas of my own, if you're open to it."</p><p>A smile tugs at the corner of Rio's mouth.</p><p>"Let's hear it."</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>11pm at the port.</p><p>Agatha stuffs her hands in the pockets of her coat and walks past shipping containers to the 23rd terminal.</p><p>The metal containers creak from rusted corners as the ocean moves against the port and the wind off the sea blows mildly, smelling like oil and old fish, but the sound of her boots is by far the loudest thing in the area.</p><p>Hours of planning and arguing over the last day have lead up to Agatha walking into a meeting with no wires, no tracker, and no agents.</p><p>The logistics were fairly easy to plan, marking off exits and entrances on a map of the shipping yard and strategically canvassing the area for any potential threats or areas of concern.</p><p>The sticking point with the team had been the elimination of a tracker.</p><p>If Agatha is abducted it will be that much harder to find her and they will have lost a witness. However, if a tracker is present and their contact is spooked then the deal is off and Agatha is back to square one.</p><p>Agatha takes an active role in planning considering it's her who will be making contact and the argument is settled when Agatha insists they abide by their contact's stipulations. If it's Ralph, Agatha is sure he wouldn't be stupid enough to try and kidnap her or remove her from the area when the FBI would come after him in waves.</p><p>She asks for Rio's trust and the alpha gives it, opening the door for other agents to agree.</p><p>Agatha knows Rio is worried, it's hard not to be, and the alpha's scent reflects it, wavering between dark wood and campfire at any given moment though she does her best to keep it at bay, choosing to trust the omega.</p><p>Agatha in turn tries to ressure Rio, becoming more touchy with the alpha, leaving her citrus blossom scent to linger on Rio's skin and clothes, bathing herself in Rio's scent in turn, like an invisible claim.</p><p>Rio tries to maintain her professionalism though her alpha wants to rub its scent over Agatha one more time before she leaves, her alpha possessive and wary as the omega goes to meet with another alpha. One with a previous claim.</p><p>Rio's jealousy is unfounded and she knows this, but it doesn't stop her imagining different scenarios with varying endings, some of which end with Agatha back with Ralph for protection Rio can't provide.</p><p>Agatha does her best to reassure Rio when she's dropped off, squeezing her hand one last time before she leaves the car and Rio drives off, glancing repeatedly in her mirrors at Agatha's dark and shrinking silhouette.</p><p>Agatha finally makes it to the 23rd terminal; spotting the sign with painted white numbers, weather beaten and aged by the salt of the sea. She looks around, noting the silent shipping containers that surround her on three sides with multiple points of possible entry and escape.</p><p>Agatha's body thrums with anxiety, ready to run or fight at any given moment, listening for any sound that might be an indication of something coming her way, relying on her ears since the dim yellow direction lighting does little to help illuminate the area.</p><p>She smells him before she hears him, hairs standing up on the back of her neck when the wind carries the scent of patchouli and cigars. It's difficult to think now that she once enjoyed his scent and sought it out when it only registers as a dull pull at her omega.</p><p>If anything, it makes her long for the smell of pine and earth.</p><p>Ralph appears in an aisle between shipping containers but Agatha refuses to move closer, her body and omega on guard, letting him step into the more open loading space closer to the ocean.</p><p>Agatha turns her wrist up to herself, checking the time on her watch.</p><p>11pm exactly.</p><p>Time starts now.</p><p>"Agatha," he greets, voice low and rough.</p><p>When he steps closer to the light, Agatha notes his appearance; his mustache and beard are longer than they've been in a while, his hair is shaggy and he looks thinner than she remembers. The bags under his eyes make the rest of his face look grey and there's a cagey edge to his movements that makes Agatha wonder if he's on drugs or just not doing well.</p><p>Agatha glares at him, "I'm here, where is it?"</p><p>Ralph shakes his head and the corner of his mouth lifts though his smirk doesn't reach his eyes.</p><p>"Hold out your arms," he demands, eyes darting around as if to spot any agents who might be hiding nearby.</p><p>Agatha's lip curls in a snarl, both of them staring at one another in a silent battle of wills until Agatha reluctantly lifts her arms out to the side.</p><p>Ralph steps into her space and Agatha resists the urge to step back as his hands start at her shoulders and run over her arms, removing her watch and checking it before patting down her sides and legs and sticking his hands in the pockets of her coat. His hands come back up over her stomach and Agatha growls in warning, nearing the end of her tolerance.</p><p>He finishes by lifting the edge of her blouse, finding no wire but the dark bruise Rio left over her scar catches his eye.</p><p>His eyes darken and his face contorts with disgust, "Whore."</p><p>Agatha grits her teeth and pushes him away with both palms on his chest. He doesn't fight the momentum, backing up a few feet to face her.</p><p>"I don't know whether to be impressed you followed directions or disappointed how stupid you are to come here alone," Ralph's grin is menacing and Agatha can feel her legs vibrating with adrenaline.</p><p>Agatha nods to the watch he still holds, "You don't think they're nearby? You have forty-five minutes until this place is crawling with agents."</p><p>Ralph frowns and glares at her, "Forty-five minutes is more than enough time to deal with you."</p><p>Agatha almost wishes he would try. Her fury feels bigger than her body, stoking and building like a furnace glowing red hot and ready to cremate him until nothing remains but dust.</p><p>"Go ahead," Agatha snarls and bares her teeth at her former mate.</p><p>"If anything happens to me, you won't like what happens next," she threatens.</p><p>"What? Your agent will hunt me down?" Ralph scoffs.</p><p>"She can join you with a bullet between the eyes."</p><p>Ralph draws a gun on her, pointing it directly at her face and she can feel the blood drain from her cheeks and limbs. It takes all of her control not to lift her hands in surrender, looking past the barrel to his crazed blue eyes.</p><p>"I don't need her to get revenge," Agatha fights to control the tremble in her voice.</p><p>"If I die tonight, by tomorrow morning, every news outlet, social media page, and YouTube channel will be flooded with footage of you, an alpha, experimenting on your wife while she begs you to stop," Agatha cuts herself off when tears well in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha had come up with the contingency with Rio outside of their meetings with her team. Agatha is familiar with how Ralph operates. He won't try to kidnap her, but he might try to kill her.</p><p>Agatha is a liability and therefore his responsibility to eliminate. He's failed twice now and Agatha knows he's a sore loser, especially if he's being pressured.</p><p>Rio didn't want to entertain the idea at first but Agatha insisted it might be one of the few advantages they could hold above Ralph, giving her a chance to ensure her survival.</p><p>Rio had reluctantly agreed.</p><p>Ralph freezes and Agatha can see the whites of his eyes as he stares and she takes the opening provided.</p><p>"Surprised? I always told you not to leave your shit lying around," Agatha huffs.</p><p>"I've seen all of them," Agatha continues, "And if you murder me, the world will see them too. You'll be guilty before you ever see a courtroom."</p><p>Agatha places emphasis on the word 'murder'. He's never killed anyone, of that she's sure. It's a big line to cross and Ralph still wants to keep his hands clean.</p><p>Ralph's gun hand shakes and a sheen of sweat covers his forehead.</p><p>"Give me the SD card," he demands.</p><p>"You searched me, I don't have it," Agatha shoots back.</p><p>Ralph roars with frustration, lowering his gun to gesture with it instead.</p><p>"Why do you always have to be so <em>fucking</em> difficult!" He rages.</p><p>"Everything has to be a fucking fight with you because you refuse to act like a fucking omega! You run around delusional, acting like an alpha...get it through your thick fucking skull, you were MADE to serve and if you don't like it, too fucking bad!"</p><p>"You're an embarrassment," he spits.</p><p>"And you were a mistake," she snarls back.</p><p>They stand there glaring at one another; lovers turned enemies through the worst kind of betrayal, any affection or fondness long dead and replaced by pure contempt.</p><p>"Running out of time," Agatha reminds him and his expression grows panicked.</p><p>"Bring me the SD card. Then you get the meds," he attempts to renegotiate.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "That isn't the deal. Give me the meds first. Then we make a new deal."</p><p>Ralph glances at the watch in his hand and grows more agitated, "No, I make the terms. Bring me the SD card then you get the meds. After the trial, you get the second half."</p><p>"I want my own insurance, give me the meds or I leak the videos one by one," Agatha replies.</p><p>"Then you get nothing," Ralph stares at her in confusion and spite.</p><p>Agatha digs deep and gathers her courage, allowing herself to release the darker thoughts she's held at bay, slipping into the liminal place in her mind that straddles madness and rage.</p><p>Agatha's grin is toothy and unhinged, a picture of a woman pushed to her limit with nothing left to lose; focus pinpointing toward revenge, even at her own expense.</p><p>"And I'm starting to care less and less by the day," Agatha curls her lip in digust.</p><p>"You took what you wanted until I had nothing left to give," she continues, fangs glistening in the low light.</p><p>"And then had the <em>audacity </em>to be offended when I fought back," The omega turns on it's former mate, unafraid to challenge him as if he's another omega needing to be put in his place.</p><p>His scent grows acrid and smoky and Agatha knows she's treading the thin line of his temper but the urge to break him is too tempting.</p><p>"All I want, is to be rid of you. To never have to see your face again," she pauses, nearly spitting the words.</p><p>"And if you make that difficult, do not underestimate my willingness to burn myself alive if it means taking you with me," she warns.</p><p>Agatha steps closer and Ralph raises the firearm again but Agatha continues forward till the barrel is pressed against her collarbone.</p><p>Her pulse races beneath cold metal, high on adrenaline and fury, impulsively making her peace with dying while her mind flits to Rio before dedicating all of her focus to running head first into the threat of death.</p><p>Agatha grins, "I'll die in peace as I drag you to hell."</p><p>Ralph stares at her like he doesn't recognize her.</p><p>Good, Agatha thinks.</p><p>He never knew her anyway.</p><p>"Tick, tock," she taunts.</p><p>An unrelated police siren sounds in the distance and Ralph jumps and Agatha bites the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>He's nervous and he should be.</p><p>Agatha has every intention of following through on her threats.</p><p>Ralph fishes around in his pocket and throws a vial toward her that she manages to catch, tucking it away in her coat pocket while she keeps her eyes on Ralph.</p><p>"You fuck me over and I'll shoot you on sight, do you hear me bitch?" He presses the gun into her skin, growing more nervous by the minute and Agatha nods, agreeing easily.</p><p>She has what she came here for, there's no need for her to continue baiting him.</p><p>Ralph seems to wait, expecting a retort but when none comes, he turns and quickly flees, disappearing into the aisles between the shipping containers, his scent growing fainter the further away he gets.</p><p>Agatha's breath whooshes from her lungs and she places her hands over her face as she struggles not to hyperventilate, forcing her breaths through her nose and out her mouth until she's no longer dizzy.</p><p>Without her watch or her phone, Agatha has no idea how much time is left but it can't be much if Ralph's hasty exit is any indication.</p><p>She decides to wait. The agents know where she is; Rio will come.</p><p>Agatha sticks her hands in her coat pockets and her right hand finds the glass vial. She doesn't bother reading it, it's too dark for her to try, but she holds on to it to reassure herself it's physically there.</p><p>It needs to be run through testing and there's a chance it could still fail but for a quiet moment Agatha hangs on to hope.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>She can hear the approaching teams and recognizes Rio's voice, holding her hands up in anticipation of them coming upon her. Pools of bright light from flashlights dart along the ground and Agatha squints when they shine in her face for a second before lowering again.</p><p>There are multiple scents mixing together as the agents flood the area but she can pick out Rio's scent as it makes a direct line to her.</p><p>"Hey," Rio greets her breathlessly and Agatha resists the urge to wrap her arms around the other woman and Rio seems to feel the same, lifting her arms before redirecting her hands to Agatha's shoulders.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio scans Agatha's body for anything out of place, but Agatha wraps her fingers around Rio's forearm to bring her attention back to her face.</p><p>"I'm okay," she confirms, noding while another agent approaches.</p><p>There's no down time, they need to interview Agatha as soon as possible before any details are lost to foggy recall, and shortly after, she's retelling what she can while the rest of the agents canvas the area.</p><p>She answers question after question, even when they repeat, knowing consistency needs to be established, and hands off the vial of medicine to another agent to courier it back to Dr. Banner and his team to begin testing.</p><p>Agatha purposefully leaves out mention of the videos, knowing Rio's team will want to take it for evidence but Agatha isn't ready to release her strongest asset so she explains the deal has been altered; he wants something else from her. He's nervous and Agatha suspects he's in some kind of trouble.</p><p>Agatha cuts Rio off with a look when she opens her mouth to rebut. It's easier for Agatha to take the blame than Rio and now that it's out there it can't be taken back. She'll tell them later or they'll find out when she's dead.</p><p>By the time Agatha is allowed to leave, birds are starting to wake and the horizon is fuzzy with dim light.</p><p>She has no energy left for talking let alone her usual bed routine and as soon as she changes, Agatha falls into bed, her racing mind reluctantly pulled under by her body's exhaustion.</p><p>
<em>Brenda. </em>
</p><p>
<em>She recognizes the other omega despite the lack of bubbly personality and rails against her restraints, trying to call to the other women though she does not respond. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Enough," Ralph hushes her and uses a firm hand on her shoulder to push her back down, moving her IV line out carefully of the way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Can't imagine what she's like at home," someone quips, a female voice.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The nurse monitoring her vitals re-adjusts one of the electrodes on her chest, same necklace in her face as the woman bends down. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Why do you think she's here?" Ralph sighs. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Must be stressful," the nurse sympathizes and Agatha feels rage blooming silently in her chest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ralph chuckles mirthlessly, "You have no idea."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"It was cute at first but after a while it's just disrespectful."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"And embarrassing," the nurse adds and Ralph nods. </em>
</p><p>
<em>'Then divorce me,' Agatha thinks bitterly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"So why keep her around?" The nurse asks conversationally like they aren't talking about Agatha right in front of her incapacitated body. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Because other than that she's perfect," Ralph admits.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha can feel the conflicting feelings of old attachment and insult warring in her chest. She can hear the affection in his voice but can't reconcile it with the restraints covering her arms and legs and vile betrayal of his actions.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"You met in college?" The nurse asks and Agatha wonders how much this woman knows about her. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Mhm," Ralph nods. "You think she's bad now, you should have met her then."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"By the time I got to her, she pissed off half the alphas in her pre-law program and rejected the other half," he huffs a laugh. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I was the only one she ever let get close," he finishes proudly and Agatha's stomach turns. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"You managed to tame her a bit," the nurse's voice picks up hopefully. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yup," Ralph smiles like he's reliving fond memories. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"My college buddies called her the Shrew and told me good luck...cause you know...Taming of the Shrew..." Ralph trails off awkwardly, running his hand through his hair.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The nurse giggles, the sound high and fake, a polite response to a stupid joke. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I will say, her resistance is almost impressive, almost ten times that of the other subjects," the nurse observes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yeah, that's Agatha," Ralph scoffs.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Everything is a fight with her."</em>
</p><p>-<em>------------</em></p><p>Rio's alpha is restless, never truly falling into a deep sleep when traces of Ralph's scent linger. She isn't sure if it's just her imagination or because Agatha's clothes from last night are in the same room but her alpha is definitely agitated and territorial.</p><p>Nevermind that he pointed a gun at her though Agatha had of course predicted such an outcome and thus the contingency plan created between them, but it still did nothing to settle Rio's nerves, clinging to the omega as she sleeps, rubbing her cheek against Agatha's hair and shoulders jealously.</p><p>It's the next best option aside from re-asserting her claim sexually which Rio wants to avoid simply because of her alpha's aggressive insistence and she worries she'll disregard Agatha's health in favor of satiating an envious urge.</p><p>Rio finally gets up when sleep escapes her, slipping out of bed and replacing her spot with her pillow when Agatha complains, feeling a bit better and smiling fondly when the omega immediately wraps herself around it, holding it between her knees and against her chest.</p><p>She needs a workout. It's been far too long since she's been able to run and her adrenaline and her alpha's tense pacing have Rio going stir crazy.</p><p>Texting Alice, Rio asks if she can stand outside of Agatha's door while she burns off her energy.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Three hours and one note to Agatha later, Rio is in the hotel gym, sweat covering her skin and soaking into the neckline of her sports bra as she runs on a treadmill.</p><p>Her normal preference would be the footpath near her home but since she's known to be associated with Agatha, she doesn't want to take the risk of recognition.</p><p>The burn feels good in her legs and lungs, expelling her anger and pent up concern until the stitch in her side and her waning energy force her to slow down.</p><p>Lowering the speed on the treadmill, Rio cools down at a walking pace, hands on her hips as her chest moves up and down while she catches her breath.</p><p>About two minutes in, the music in her ears cuts off and an incoming call rings through her headphones and she double taps her right ear bud to answer.</p><p>"Vidal," she barks.</p><p>"Mijita," her mother's voice greets her and Rio is taken aback, looking at her phone for both the time and to confirm it really is her mother.</p><p>"Hola, mamí, qué lo que?"</p><p>It isn't unusual for her mother to call but it is unusual for it to be this early.</p><p>"Mijita," her mother repeats and Rio is immediately alert, hearing strain in her mother's voice she hasn't heard since her abuelita passed.</p><p>"Mamí, what's wrong?" Rio stops the treadmill and grabs her towel, wiping her face and finding a corner with a bench to sit and talk.</p><p>"Your father called."</p><p>Three words and Rio feels like she might shatter.</p><p>What the fuck? How dare he force himself back into their lives when she and her mother had written him off long ago. Rio thought she would go the rest of her life without ever seeing or hearing from him again, had laid that part of her life to rest with his exit, barring and locking the door behind him.</p><p>Suddenly she's eight years old again and fighting the tighteness in her chest.</p><p>"Why? What's wrong? Estás bien?"</p><p>She's older now, she can do more than she could as a child and, as far as Rio is concerned, she won't hesitate to shoot just because he's her sperm donor.</p><p>"I'm okay, mijita, he had a message for you," her mother says shakily, poorly concealing her worry.</p><p>"What is it?" She asks immediately. Why would he want to talk to her after all these years? He barely cared for her; she's surprised he remembers her at all.</p><p>"I won't repeat it word for word," her mother says firmly which can only mean it was vile or laden with curse words. Probably both.</p><p>"But he said to tell you to back off."</p><p>"Back off of what?" Rio asks, trying not to interrogate her mother like a suspect.</p><p>"He didn't say, just that your... <em>preferences</em> are..." Her mother hesitates, aware how sensitive the topic is for her daughter.</p><p>"Are what?" Rio encourages, "It's okay, mamí, I know it's not true."</p><p>Her mother sighs deeply and it sounds like relief. Rio feels her affection swell, knowing her mother wouldn't want to say something that upsets her. Sometimes Rio wonders if it's because she's an alpha or because her mother is trying to make up for her childhood. Either way, Rio doesn't want her mother to worry; determined she have a softer life than what she had before.</p><p>"Your preferences are interfering with his life, he said," her mother answers, "and you need to back off."</p><p>"Is something going on, mijita?"</p><p>There's no way, Rio thinks. But there's only one reason she would need to back off of anything and though she doesn't want to believe it, the resources and the motivation are there.</p><p>"Just an intense case," she tells the half-truth. The last thing she wants to do is drag her family into this mess.</p><p>"Maybe he read something or someone he knows found out about me," she tries to assuage her mother's worry.</p><p>There's a pause and Rio wonders if her mother can see through her explanation but she either accepts it or lets it slide.</p><p>"Be careful, mijita," she says finally.</p><p>"I will," Rio promises, "te amo."</p><p>"Te amo, mi amor."</p><p>As soon as her mother hangs up, Rio is on the phone to her team and then the Maryland FBI office, giving them a heads up and asking them to keep an eye out for more potential threats.</p><p>Rio heads back up to their room relieving Alice who, by her look, already knows thanks to rapid communication.</p><p>"You okay?" Alice asks and Rio nods distractedly.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm good, just...weird, you know?"</p><p>Alice doesn't really know but she nods along anyway, "Want me to hang around? I can get a cover for surveillance..."</p><p>Rio waves her off, "No, go. The less this affects the case the better."</p><p>Alice looks torn but Rio insists and Alice leaves for her surveillance shift, leaving Rio to enter the room.</p><p>The smell of shampoo and bodywash is the first thing she senses and under that, Agatha's scent, warmed by a shower.</p><p>The omega emerges from the bathroom, hair wet and wrapped in a robe and Rio can't help herself and walks to her quickly, wrapping her arms around the other woman, holding her tightly as if she can meld their bodies together by sheer will.</p><p>Agatha's initial smile drops to concern and her arms automatically come up, one wrapping around a slim waist and the other laying flat against her spine.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Agatha asks, attempting to pull back to look at the other woman but Rio doesn't give an inch so Agatha stops trying and leans into the alpha, releasing a wave of pheromones to calm her distress though her own panic starts to rise.</p><p>"It's a lot," Rio sighs and sniffles and Agatha squeezes her in response.</p><p>"What is?" Agatha murmurs, carding her fingers through Rio's hair, ignoring the dried sweat along her hairline.</p><p>As Agatha's pheromones start to take effect, all of the physical exertion and lack of sleep hits Rio all at once and suddenly, explaining everything feels like a monumental task. All she wants is to sleep next to her chosen omega and hopefully wake up in a better head space to deal with what she's learned in the last 24 hours.</p><p>"I need to sleep, I'll tell you after," Rio nearly begs and it sounds more like an apology than anything else so Agatha bites back her curiosity.</p><p>"Go shower," Agatha instructs, "I can work on the desk for a few hours."</p><p>Rio grunts in disapproval, "Stay? Bring the computer to the bed if you have to."</p><p>Agatha can't bring herself to refuse. How often has she been the one to ask Rio the same thing? And now that their roles have reversed, Agatha's omega jumps at the chance to care for her m-</p><p>Agatha freezes and violently cuts off her train of thought.</p><p>"Go," she urges Rio, "I'll be here."</p><p>Rio pouts but does as she's told, knowing she'll feel better after a shower.</p><p>The water starts and Agatha turns back to the much too small twin bed, again frustrated at the inability to build a proper nest, and turns down the blankets, crawling into the bed with her phone to wait for the alpha.</p><p>Rio emerges in her own robe, skin pink and dewy from the heat and scrubbing, and crawls straight into bed, not bothering with pajamas, making herself the big spoon and molding her body to Agatha's curves.</p><p>It isn't too long before Rio falls asleep with her face buried against the back of Agatha's shoulder, snoring softly.</p><p>Whatever is bothering the alpha has Rio tightening her hold in her sleep every time Agatha shifts so she forces herself to remain still for a while, ending up on her back with Rio using her like a body pillow.</p><p>The flip phone sits charging on the night stand, silent since the previous night. Agatha expects she'll be contacted again as soon as Ralph figures out what to do.</p><p>She wonders if Brenda would be in the same position if she weren't in a coma. Selfishly she wishes the other omega were awake, at least then they could compare notes. Ralph must be under pressure to keep Agatha quiet or get rid of her no matter how. His desperation is evidence of that.</p><p>Something must have happened in the short time Rio was gone, Agatha surmises. The alpha's scent fluctuates in intensity, shifting with her dreams as Agatha's omega responds accordingly, soothing her in sleep with her pheromones.</p><p>Agatha thinks back over the night, feeling a little embarrassed by how rash she was but she brushes it off, she's alive and ultimately they have the vial of medicine in possession.</p><p>They were told it would take at least a week to examine, test, and analyze the contents. Until then, Agatha prefers to pretend it doesn't exist, not willing to raise her hopes too high.</p><p>Rio in turn, dreams; her mind subconsciously trying to reconcile Agatha's meeting and everything her father's warning drags up from the depths of her past.</p><p>She can feel the threat pressing in on her, gunning for the omega she protects with her body, hunched over her like a human shield, flashing between her alpha and human self and growling constantly.</p><p>Her dream self knows this isn't sustainable. She tries to run, hiding Agatha away, but they're always found and again Rio is faced with running to protect Agatha from a threat that even Rio isn't sure she can handle.</p><p>It isn't until she turns and faces the threat that Rio feels more in control. She isn't sure whether she'll win but it's better than being under the constant stress.</p><p>Just as she lunges, Rio is jarred to consciousness, her mind leaving the outcome of the fight a mystery.</p><p>It's about mid-day and Rio groans. She hates waking up in the middle of the day. It feels like her whole routine is thrown off, wasting a perfectly good day to the point she wants to go back to sleep and start over again tomorrow.</p><p>Unfortunately she's awake and alert enough that Rio knows there's no point in trying to go back to bed.</p><p>Besides, she can feel the weight of Agatha's hand in her hair, scratching absently and pausing when Rio stirs. The alpha stretches and Agatha bookmarks the page in her book and sets it aside.</p><p>Rio groans, clearly cranky and Agatha is lightly amused. Usually Rio is up before Agatha, much too alert and already sipping on coffee. Seeing the alpha grumpy is a whole new experience; entertaining in how out of character it seems.</p><p>"We have to go back to the cabin today," Agatha whispers and Rio frowns, pouting.</p><p>"We need the videos," Agatha continues, coaxing her like she might a sleepy toddler.</p><p>Rio huffs and whines but tosses off the blanket, robe askew from her tossing and turning while Agatha stares unabashedly, heat rising to her face.</p><p>She's never wanted a person so much.</p><p>Agatha exhales and masters her self-control, refusing to let herself get distracted by her own libido.</p><p>"And I was thinking...in the car," Agatha proposes tentatively, "We could talk."</p><p>A single sleepy eye opens and stares at Agatha; depths of brown that go on for ages, shifting as her thoughts flicker and blinking slowly.</p><p>"Yeah, I did say I would tell you later didn't I?" Rio sighs.</p><p>Agatha frowns and grows prickly, "Well you don't have to if you don't want to."</p><p>"No, sorry," Rio places her hand on Agatha's leg, "I'm anticipating."</p><p>"Anticipating what?" Agatha huffs, her irritation dissipating.</p><p>"How you'll react," Rio rubs her hands over her face, trying to motivate herself to leave the bed.</p><p>"Well now I want to know even more," Agatha replies honestly and Rio chuckles.</p><p>"I promise I'll tell you in the car," Rio offers.</p><p>If she doesn't get out of bed now, she's going to lose the will to be productive and with Agatha in bed and her emotions a little strung out, all her alpha wants to do is sequester both of them in the hotel room to take turns at sleep and sex.</p><p>"Fine," Agatha huffs and rises from the bed, displacing the alpha enough that it's easier for her to rip herself away from the blankets to get dressed.</p><p>Agatha finds herself admiring the alpha with affection and thinks it odd still to have small moments of happiness within the disaster that is her life, wondering if she's been broken enough to desperately seek what she lacks or if it's normal to vacillate between grief and joy.</p><p>Opting for a blouse and a long skirt, Agatha packs up her bag and waits for Rio to get ready, making sure to grab the flip phone and placing it in her coat pocket.</p><p>Arms snake around her waist and Rio drops her forehead to Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>"Caffeine first," she grumbles, "Then car."</p><p>Agatha melts, unable to hold on to her annoyance.</p><p>"Fine," she grumbles affectionately.</p><p>"Caffeine first."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Turns out, Rio's choice of mid-day caffeine is a RedBull.</p><p>"This is awful," Agatha makes a face after taking a sip and Rio takes the can and downs a healthy gulp.</p><p>"But it works," Rio shrugs.</p><p>They've been on the road for about fifteen minutes, stopping by a gas station to grab drinks and snacks since they'll be missing lunch while driving, and it isn't until Rio merges onto the highway that she's settled enough to start talking.</p><p>"My dad called my mom."</p><p>The temperature in the car seems to drop.</p><p>Agatha glances at Rio in her peripheral in concern, trying to gage Rio's feelings, sipping her iced tea and waiting for the other woman to continue.</p><p>Rio doesn't seem very upset initially and Agatha tries to recall everything Rio has told her about the man who sired her.</p><p>"He had a message for me," Rio continues, finding it easier to talk while focusing on the road.</p><p>Agatha lifts an eyebrow and bites her tongue to keep the questions from spilling out of her mouth and Rio glances at her, noticing the restraint and pressing her lips into a tight smile.</p><p>"I didn't get it word for word but something about my <em>preferences </em>fucking with his life," Rio's voice rumbles in her chest.</p><p>For a second Agatha almost callously asks if that's all before beating back the instinct and reminding herself just because she's used to being a disappointment doesn't mean everyone else is and outside of her father, Rio has known love and support.</p><p>"Welcome to the bad kids club," Agatha quips, "Once we get more than two members we can make jackets."</p><p>Rio smirks and takes another sip of her energy drink, the carbonation and sweetness coating her throat as she swallows.</p><p>"He warned me to back off," Rio finishes and Agatha can't help herself anymore.</p><p>"Back off of what? Why does he care now?"</p><p>Rio looks over at Agatha, her weighty gaze settling for a few seconds on Agatha's and she answers her own question, pieces clicking into place.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>A new type of guilt settles over Agatha. As much as she didn't want anyone going after Jen, she hadn't given a thought that Rio might be vulnerable too.</p><p>The darkness in the back of her mind returns but not filled with memories, instead she envisions Rio's life ruined because of her. If any trace of the company is left, Rio will always be looking over her shoulder. Especially if Agatha doesn't testify and the case is lost.</p><p>Agatha will be gone and Rio will carry the burden.</p><p>Suddenly, threatening Ralph with the videos seems like a stupid idea. Her selfishness allows her to discard her own life and give no further care to what ripples her actions might create.</p><p>The shift in Agatha's scent is easy to detect in the small space and Rio reaches across the center console to grasp Agatha's hand.</p><p>"Don't," she says, more of a request than a demand.</p><p>"Don't what?" Agatha shoots back with more force than intended.</p><p>Rio squeezes Agatha's hand, relieved when the other woman doesn't pull away.</p><p>"You scared him," Rio says firmly.</p><p>"If he weren't scared he wouldn't be going to desperate measures," Rio insists.</p><p>This is the reaction Rio anticipated, knowing Agatha would blame herself like she's a curse, bringing bad omens and misfortune to everything she touches.</p><p>But Rio knows better.</p><p>"It's a pattern in some cases," Rio explains, "Suspect gets desperate and sloppy when they feel like they aren't in control so they do something to try and reassert their power."</p><p>Agatha leans her elbow on the lip of the car window, fidgeting with her fingers rubbing over her lips as she tries to digest Rio's words while her internal psyche continues to whisper scornfully in the voices of her past.</p><p>"Your family-" Agatha starts but Rio cuts her off.</p><p>"Is fine," Rio assures and presses her lips together.</p><p>"And I don't give a shit if it affects my dad."</p><p>Agatha can tell by the alpha's scent that Rio isn't quite telling the truth and she understands the pain that comes with rejection from a parent but she can't imagine the amount of damage done when it's your sire.</p><p>In a way, Agatha is lucky her bond withered at birth; though she wonders if it didn't simply transfer over to her mother with the way she isn't able to cut the woman out of her life entirely.</p><p>"It's a fucking bitch isn't it?" Agatha grumbles after a few moments of silence.</p><p>"What's that?" Rio asks curiously.</p><p>Agatha bites her thumbnail, "Caring for people who don't deserve it."</p><p>The corner of Rio's mouth lifts mirthlessly as she huffs, "Yeah, it really fucking is."</p><p>Rio lifts their joined hands and kisses Agatha's knuckles as the omega watches.</p><p>A silent understanding passes between them, the acknowledgement of a shared pain, of knowing they both deserve better but still susceptible to the festering parental wound that flares up when provoked.</p><p>Part of Agatha would like to meet Rio's mother but she refrains from mentioning it, not wanting to imply anything more permanent between them.</p><p>Still, a part of Agatha wonders what it would be like.</p><p>As they are right now, it's as if they exist in an isolated and chaotic bubble, only concerned with the people in their immediate circle by necessity, leaving the two of them to lean heavily on one another. Part of Agatha enjoys it and her omega is thrilled but another part of her wants to weave Rio into her life and vice versa until they're intertwined and inseparable.</p><p>Agatha rubs her thumb over Rio's, "Sure?"</p><p>Agatha isn't quite sure what she's asking, it feels like a lot of things at once but Rio flicks on her blinker to merge lanes and catches Agatha's eyes as she looks over her shoulder and seems to understand.</p><p>"I'm sure," Rio nods.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The cabin is a little stale but other than that, it's exactly the way they left it a few days ago.</p><p>It feels a little bit like coming back from a vacation in that the cabin is a more familiar and lived in space and exclusive to the two of them, again isolating them in their own little bubble.</p><p>The first thing Agatha does is secure the hard drive, keeping it safe and storing it in the nightstand upstairs.</p><p>After that, she changes the sheets while Rio opens the downstairs to allow for airflow and checks on what's in the fridge that needs to be tossed.</p><p>It's all very domestic and Agatha almost feels embarrassed by how much she enjoys it.</p><p>When she's finished upstairs, Agatha goes down to the kitchen where she can hear Rio rustling around and finds her bending over to check if some of the produce is still good.</p><p>Agatha smirks, admiring the alpha's figure and leans her hip against the kitchen counter.</p><p>Her admiration isn't entirely sexual, though it is the most prominent feeling, but it's more of an intense fondness found in familiarity that strikes in the most innocuous of moments, creating a memory from the mundane.</p><p>"Lettuce is a little wilted but still good for a couple days," Rio says absently, scenting Agatha's presence as soon as she is near.</p><p>"We can have a salad and something else for dinner," she suggests and it's so painfully ordinary that Agatha wraps her arms around herself, trying to keep herself from getting caught up in pretending.</p><p>Rio says something under her breath and Agatha's ears perk, "What?"</p><p>Rio smirks, "I said I know what I'm having."</p><p>Agatha frowns in confusion, "What is it?"</p><p>The alpha turns to look over her shoulder, purposefully dragging her eyes from Agatha's feet to her face and Agatha can feel the heat rushing to her neck and cheeks and scoffs.</p><p>"Real food," Agatha replies firmly, rolling her eyes as Rio huffs.</p><p>"Fine, you can be dessert."</p><p>"Christ, you're obnoxious," Agatha snorts.</p><p>But after dinner, when Rio leads her upstairs, Agatha goes willingly, parting herself for the alpha to lap at like she really is trying to devour Agatha, moaning louder than the omega like she's tasting the most intoxicating ambrosia, selfishly chasing the taste more than the pleasure, using a firm grip to keep Agatha in place as she writhes and bucks.</p><p>They spend the night touching and exploring; much slower than their previous rushed and impassioned encounters that were bordered by high emotions.</p><p>Fingers and mouths travel over curves and valleys, mapping and expanding and using the sounds between them to create a network of pleasure and desire that runs from fingertips to toes.</p><p>Rio wants to make Agatha come over and over, addicted to the feeling of watching the omega fall apart in her arms, body trembling uncontrollably as the breath leaves her lungs and her head falls back in surrender.</p><p>Just when she thinks they might be done, Agatha will whisper in Rio's ear, using her silver tongue to expertly stoke the coals of her desire; or Rio's touch will gradually go from affectionate to amorous, leading Agatha from relaxation to arousal without much effort until they come together again.</p><p>This feels like a luxury, like decadence; spending time, their most precious resource, to indulge in one another, both silently agreeing it's worth the price of a few hours of sleep to know the feel of lips on skin and the weight of hips against thighs.</p><p>And when they do finally fall to exhaustion, limbs tangled and skin pressing against skin and sharing the same pillow, Agatha feels a peace she isn't sure she's ever felt; willingly melting into another soul without feeling the need to fight and without fear of never resurfacing.</p><p>She falls into a tranquil slumber, blanketed by moonlight and Rio's steady contented scent.</p><p>------------</p><p>It takes two days for the next call to come.</p><p>Agatha reveals to Rio what happened in the rest of the meeting with Ralph resulting in an argument when Rio gets upset about Agatha's disregard for her own life, taking a break from one another when they both start to get overwhelmed and Agatha starts a headache.</p><p>But it's Agatha who is surprised when Rio returns an hour later, calmer and more rational. She had expected them to simply ignore it and move on when they both feel better; instead, Rio sets the stage for them to talk about the underlying and unavoidable fear of loss that rears its head.</p><p>Rio agrees to move on, what's done is done and in exchange Agatha promises to be more careful. They agree to figure out an alternative plan for the next meeting that doesn't involve Agatha going in alone and unarmed.</p><p>Agatha doesn't keep the flip phone on her person; doing so feels akin to attaching a chain to her own leg, but she does leave it in the common room when they're awake with the ringer on full volume and on the nightstand when they sleep.</p><p>No other threats or related activity pops up during that time, thankfully, and Agatha gets to hear Rio speaking Spanish to her mother, reassuring her everything is fine while Agatha struggles to control her traitorous desire that before was once so manageable, and even ignorable, at times.</p><p>She still takes her suppressants, so Agatha is forced to eliminate biology as a reason but she isn't ready to face her remaining options, finding it too deeply vulnerable for her to handle right now.</p><p>Its early evening when the phone's vibration on the dining room table buzzes harshly followed quickly by the ringer as the LCD screen lights up a digital green, unable to display the encrypted number.</p><p>Rio joins her with the recording device and Agatha pushes her glasses up onto her head.</p><p>Under the table, Rio wraps her ankle around Agatha's, needing some kind of contact she hadn't been able to provide the first two times.</p><p>Agatha presses the green answer button and puts the call on speaker.</p><p>"I hope you've come to bargain," she greets.</p><p><em>"I've always admired your mind,"</em> the AI voice answers leisurely and the hairs on her arms stand up.</p><p>The tonal shift throws her for a loop; Ralph would be hurling insults and cutting straight to the point, not complimenting her intelligence.</p><p>Her instincts tell her this isn't Ralph.</p><p>"Then you won't waste my time," Agatha replies tersely, recovering from her momentary shock.</p><p><em>"Indeed, time is precious these days,"</em> the voice coos and Agatha clenches her jaw, unsure if the statement is meant as a slight.</p><p><em>"I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement,"</em> the voice continues.</p><p>
<em>"I'm not too proud to admit you've put us in a precarious situation so I offer you this."</em>
</p><p>Agatha holds her breath and it's so silent between the two of them that Agatha can hear her own heart beat in her ears.</p><p>
<em>"You agree not to testify and you deliver the SD card. In exchange, we give you the second part of the reversal treatment and you walk away, no strings attached and free from any further involvement."</em>
</p><p>The deal is heavily in Agatha's favor; giving her exactly what she wants and it makes her immediately suspicious.</p><p>"What's the catch?" Agatha asks bluntly.</p><p><em>"No catch,"</em> the voice replies.</p><p>
<em>"Of course if you do decide to renege, we will hunt you down and make sure you never speak again."</em>
</p><p>Rio growls softly and squeezes Agatha's ankle.</p><p>
<em>"But you've proven to be a woman of your word and I doubt you would risk jeopardizing such a favorable agreement."</em>
</p><p><em>"Would you?"</em> The voice taunts and Agatha stares at Rio across the table.</p><p>"Of course not," Agatha scoffs, lowering her eyes to the table in front of her, "I'm not stupid."</p><p><em>"Exactly,"</em> the voice sounds smug and Agatha feels belittled, swallowing it down to get through the call.</p><p><em>"Three days from now, VRX distribution trucking. Same terms. No wires, no trackers, and no agents,"</em> the voice pauses to let their words sink in as if they can tell Rio is tapping away on her phone, updating her team in real time.</p><p>
<em>"You'll receive a message an hour before our rendezvous. Be ready."</em>
</p><p>The caller hangs up without a goodbye and Agatha closes the phone and pushes it away from her, the sight of it offending her with everything it represents.</p><p>Rio is again on the phone with her team, discussing planning sessions and assigning agents to look into the trucking company as a potential stop in the trafficking ring, surmising it would be a perfect cover to transport omegas.</p><p>They assign agents to canvas and survey the area, setting up around the clock surveillance in the days leading up to their meeting to see if any other suspicious activity can be detected.</p><p>In her mind, Agatha creates the outline of her own plan, waiting patiently for Rio to finish before discussing any of the details.</p><p>Rio hangs up after an hour or so and Agatha moves to the couch, wanting to settle in for the discussion and be able to touch the other woman.</p><p>"No trackers, no agents," Rio confirms, "But we can do a wire. Sort of."</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes skeptically, suspicious of the idea, "An hour isn't enough time to set that up and he searched me the last time."</p><p>"It doesn't have to be wired," Rio posits, her leg shaking as she thinks.</p><p>"Make a copy of the SD card and give it to Jen," Agatha interjects her own thoughts.</p><p>"If anything happens, release it. If they stick to the deal you can use it when I'm gone," Agatha instructs.</p><p>Rio tenses beside her and Agatha rubs her hand down her arm.</p><p>"Just a pre-caution," she soothes and Rio nods tersely.</p><p>"I asked the lab about the vial, nothing conclusive yet," Rio confesses.</p><p>Agatha nods, "They said it would take about a week."</p><p>"I know," Rio pouts, "But I had to check..."</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together, understanding the urge. It's why she refuses to think about it and pretends it doesn't exist because the torture of not knowing is a type of personal hell Agatha is sick of and with so many unknowns, it's best to focus on what she can control though she's sure it will still eat away at her the same way it does Rio.</p><p>"Tomorrow we have to go back to headquarters to plan with the rest of the team," Rio informs her as Agatha nods and curls into Rio's side.</p><p>Three days. A lot of planning can happen in three days and she wonders if the date is arbitrary or if there are other hidden agendas at play.</p><p>"You know that wasn't Ralph right?" Agatha asks and Rio nods.</p><p>"I wasn't sure until you reacted," Rio explains.</p><p>"But we know he isn't acting alone."</p><p>"No, he isn't," Agatha agrees.</p><p>"He's smart but he doesn’t do well under pressure. If he's lasted this long it's because he has help."</p><p>"Do you think Evanora might be helping him?" Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "I don't think so. If the news is picking up on the details of the case she'd be too embarrassed."</p><p>Besides, when would her mother ever compliment her mind?</p><p>"It's someone else."</p><p>They continue planning and talking over details and eventually head to bed early in an effort to beat morning rush hour into the city.</p><p>They have three days. It feels like what Agatha imagines the world ending might feel like, focusing only on making it to the end and surviving, unsure what comes after.</p><p>Survive first, she thinks.</p><p>Live after.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Agatha rests her head on her hand, fingers tangled in her hair as she watches the agents disseminate and argue over plans and information for the thousandth time since lunch.</p><p>Normally she would jump into the thick of it like last time but with so many other alphas in the room over a longer period of time, her omega becomes wary of making a fool out of Rio. So for the past day and a half Agatha has been watching and listening, absorbing what the team says and keeping her quips mostly to herself.</p><p>Rio tries to bring Agatha in to the conversation but she either defers or gives a shorter answer than expected. The alpha gives Agatha a puzzled look after a while that Agatha subtly waves away.</p><p>The team takes a short break, some agents continuing to review case files while others leave for a snack or coffee or the bathroom.</p><p>Rio cocks her head toward the door and Agatha follows her out, grateful to leave the conference room and clear her nose and lungs of the other alphas in the room.</p><p>Rio leads them toward a small garden on the first floor; part of the "wellness" initiatives their branch had started a few years ago, walking along the stone path toward a round concrete table with benches.</p><p>"You're quiet," Rio points out and Agatha is just tired enough that her filter fails.</p><p>"Bet you're thrilled," Agatha snaps and Rio frowns.</p><p>"I miss your voice," Rio says sincerely and apparently it's the right thing to say because Agatha deflates easily and Rio presses her leg against Agatha's under the table.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio ducks her head down.</p><p>Agatha leans toward the alpha, resisting the urge to basically shove her face in Rio's neck.</p><p>"I don't want to piss anyone off," she sighs.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow and pokes her tongue against the inside of her cheek.</p><p>"In the nicest way possible, when has that ever been a problem?"</p><p>Agatha narrows her gaze, glaring at Rio, "You're at work."</p><p>"So?" Rio shrugs.</p><p>"It's not embarrassing to have your..." Agatha cuts herself off.</p><p>Now that she hears herself say it out loud, Agatha realizes how ridiculous she sounds. Agatha is a witness and Rio is assigned to her as protection. She's acting like Rio is her mate, assuming her actions reflect on the alpha.</p><p>Agatha mentally tells herself to get her shit together.</p><p>"Your witness just jump in all the time?" She covers.</p><p>Rio frowns, "No, we work with witnesses all the time."</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together and nods, gathering herself from her near slip.</p><p>"I think I'm just exhausted," she excuses.</p><p>"It's been a long day of talking."</p><p>"Yeah," Rio agrees.</p><p>It's likely to be a long evening as well, needing to nail down details since the call could come at any time tomorrow.</p><p>Rio sneaks her arm around Agatha's waist, still keeping just within the bounds of propriety and rubs her hand over Agatha's hip.</p><p>Rio scent intensifies and Agatha hums in relief and acknowledgement.</p><p>They stay for a few more minutes until Rio gets a text and they're forced to head back upstairs to the conference room.</p><p>As they gather, Agatha claims the chair closest to Rio and though the alpha's arms are crossed over her chest and her expression remains serious, she can feel Rio's shoe against hers in silent approval.</p><p>"Three mile radius," one agent starts and this time Agatha is quick to speak.</p><p>"Five at the closest, you'll spook them," she argues.</p><p>"That adds another minute to response time if anything happens," another agent points out.</p><p>"Then I guess you better drive fast," Agatha quips.</p><p>The agents begin debating distances and fastest response routes and Agatha glances at Rio in her peripheral, a proud smirk playing on the alpha's lips that has her omega rolling.</p><p>Agatha settles in for the rest of the evening, buoyed by Rio's presence and steady support.</p><p>-------------</p><p>The day of, they both wake early and much too sober for morning.</p><p>Agatha wears a dark burgundy pantsuit accented with gold jewelry; a simple matching set including a pair of earrings, a bracelet, and an emerald green pendant that reminds her of Rio's home.</p><p>Another necklace from her recovered memories itches at the back of her mind. The same pearl surrounded by smaller diamonds, making it look like a dainty flower. She remembers seeing it but not what it means. It looks like something Ralph would have given her but without access to her old jewelry box, she can't confirm.</p><p>Agatha pushes it aside for now, adding it to the pile of random snippets of memory she has no context for.</p><p>They drive into the city to Rio's office, not really caring about getting stuck during morning rush hour into bumper to bumper traffic.</p><p>There is nothing else planned aside from waiting for the phone call and Agatha grows quickly annoyed at the office, not wanting to start any task in the event she needs to drop it and leave.</p><p>It leaves her bored and anxious and Rio is no better, fidgety and tense as she cups her coffee in one hand.</p><p>They visit the shooting range but both of them are distracted, eyeing the phone every so often as if they might miss the call, the anticipation hanging over them like an menacing lingering entity.</p><p>Every time an hour passes, Agatha grumbles, thinking of a million better uses of her time.</p><p>The call comes near the end of the work day and Agatha forces herself not to answer after the first ring.</p><p>She doesn't bother with a greeting, simply pressing answer and waiting for instructions.</p><p>"See you in an hour. Back warehouse office."</p><p>The caller hangs up and Agatha hands the phone to Rio, no longer needing the device.</p><p>Rio sends a message to her team and grabs her keys, "There's an Uber downstairs at the corner."</p><p>Agatha nods and falls into step with Rio as they walk to the elevator and exit in the parking garage.</p><p>Rio halts Agatha with a hand on her elbow before they part and Agatha turns her head just in time to catch Rio's lips, feeling the alpha's fingers in her hair against her temples.</p><p>She kisses Rio back, matching the alpha's fervor and pouring unspoken affection and worry into the other woman, curling her fingers over Rio's wrists and chasing her lips for a last few pecks before pressing their foreheads together.</p><p>"I'll see you soon," Agatha promises and Rio blows out a slow breath.</p><p>"I'll be there."</p><p>Agatha turns her head to press her lips to Rio's palm, soaking up a last bit of comfort before forcing herself to walk away, refusing to look back lest she lose her nerve.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Getting in to the compound is smooth and quick, after the Uber drops Agatha at the front gate.</p><p>She walks past, noting the amount of trucks both parked and driving around, moving to loading stations, weighing stations, and finally out directly onto the highway.</p><p>Agatha knows from their planning the facility has three such exits depending on the destination of the truck, perfect for moving a large amount of goods, drugs...or people.</p><p>She walks past the main front of the building and once she's inside, the noise is nearly deafening; pallets of cling-filmed product are moved around to various loading areas, forklifts beep loudly as they back up, orders that sound like gibberish to Agatha under the noise are shouted between workers with accompanying hand signals and for a moment Agatha wonders how she's supposed to find the back office in this chaos.</p><p>Is she supposed to ask someone? As it is, no one seems to pay any attention to her which strikes Agatha as odd. Dressed as she is, Agatha thought a few more eyebrows would rise in this environment but they ignore her like they're used to seeing well dressed women come through frequently.</p><p>The implications of that thought turns Agatha's stomach as she continues searching for a hint of where to go.</p><p>There's a red safety light above a door with a glass window covered by blinds in the far corner of the loading area and Agatha assumes it's her best bet, cutting across the large area as quickly as she can and trying the door, finding it unlocked.</p><p>When Agatha slips inside and lets the door close behind her, the sounds suddenly fall to a dull background hum and her ears ring for a moment, adjusting to the sudden change in volume.</p><p>There's a short hallway in front of her and two doors on her left. One room has its lights on so Agatha knocks and opens the door, finding it to be a smaller-sized office, cramped with a too large desk and mismatched filing cabinets that look like they might be older than Agatha.</p><p>Behind the desk sits Ralph and Agatha stops cold, two scents hitting her at once.</p><p>Behind Ralph, stands Paul.</p><p>Her heart slams against her ribs and for a moment she thinks about running, fighting the instinct and rooting her feet to the floor.</p><p>"So I'm not allowed to bring a friend but you are? Hardly seems fair," Agatha scoffs and Paul grins while Ralph remains stone-faced and glaring.</p><p>"Beautiful as always, Agatha," Paul greets, leaning back against the filing cabinets, hands in his pockets.</p><p>"Paul," Agatha nods tersely.</p><p>"Put your arms out," Ralph growls, pleasant veneer gone; replaced with contempt and spite for his former mate.</p><p>Agatha sighs heavily but does so, letting Ralph check her for a wire or a weapon, hands trailing over her arms and inside her suit jacket while Agatha growls threateningly on instinct, her omega complaining about the touch of another non-preferred alpha.</p><p>He reaches into her coat pockets, coming up with the SD card and holding it up between two fingers for Paul to see over his shoulder.</p><p>Agatha lowers her arms when Ralph steps away, her growling ceasing for the moment as she re-adjusts her jacket and crosses her arms over her chest.</p><p>As Ralph rounds the desk and sits back down, Paul pipes up, "How've you been, Agatha? It's been a while."</p><p>Agatha cuts her gaze to Paul's smug grin, "Not really any of your business is it?"</p><p>Paul's pout is exaggerated, "Ouch. We used to be quite friendly, Agatha."</p><p>"Were we?" Agatha raises an eyebrow and Ralph opens a laptop and inserts the SD card into a side slot.</p><p>"I considered us friends," Paul shrugs and disgust crawls up Agatha's spine.</p><p>"Even had a bit of a sire-like urge to watch over you," Paul continues and Ralph's sneer isn't subtle though Agatha wonders why he cares.</p><p>"Wonderful, a guardian angel from hell," Agatha replies her tone falsely saccharine, no longer obligated to bite back her true thoughts from the alpha.</p><p>Paul only chuckles, "I did always enjoy your rather prickly attitude."</p><p>"That makes one of you," Agatha glares at Ralph as he checks the contents of the SD card and scans it for any malware or hidden code.</p><p>"Hm, I was rather disappointed to hear about the divorce," Paul says sympathetically and Ralph's shoulders tense, rising slightly toward his ears and even Agatha clenches her jaw, feeling the awkwardness of not just mentioning it but it seems just as much of a barb toward Ralph as it is to Agatha.</p><p>"Yeah, well," Agatha waves it away.</p><p>"But I've heard you might have a new beau," Paul keeps pushing and Ralph curls his lip and Agatha's flush invades her chest and neck uninvited as she grinds ger molars together, her scent growing noticeably bitter.</p><p>Paul holds his hands up to placate Agatha, "Like I said, I feel <em>protective.</em>"</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together and frowns; Paul's version of protection feels like a layer of slime weighing her down, clinging and threatening suffocation.</p><p>"But there's a difference between protection and possession isn't there?" Paul continues conversationally.</p><p>"Your agent knows that."</p><p>Agatha's pulse beats faster and she glares at the alpha over Ralph's head.</p><p>Paul pushes himself off the cabinets and walks around the desk, hands in his pockets.</p><p>Agatha resists the urge to step back but her nose wrinkles when his scent gets closer; her body still remembers the danger he poses and she struggles to control her response, swallowing painfully around a knot in her throat.</p><p>Paul stands about an arms length away and Agatha tightens her arms over her chest, subconsciously, trying to protect herself.</p><p>"It's a difficult lesson to learn; the line between love and obsession," Paul shakes his head as if disappointed.</p><p>Agatha glances at Ralph behind the desk, unable to figure out the direction of the conversation or its purpose and her ex offers no clues, seemingly just as confused as Agatha.</p><p>"What does that have to do with anything?" Agatha asks carefully.</p><p>"Well, like father like daughter, no?" Paul shrugs.</p><p>"I mean, granted, she may not try to sell you off to other men to settle her debts like him, but from what I recall, he was quite possessive of his wife," he pauses, a half-smile tugging on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>"He tried to offer his daughter instead."</p><p>Agatha's breath grows shallow, trying to process what she's being told as her heart thrums anxiously and aches for her alpha.</p><p>Paul rocks on his heels, "Can you believe that? A sire rejecting their offspring."</p><p>He sighs, "Probably sensed she was too much like him."</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, her gut rolling uncomfortably as Paul goes on, unwilling to continue playing coy.</p><p>"Why are you telling me this?" Agatha asks suspiciously, shifting her weight from one foot to the other.</p><p>"I wasn't actually talking to you," Paul smirks.</p><p>Paul removes a hand from his pocket, stretching out a finger and tapping on the emerald green pendant around her neck.</p><p>"I was talking to Agent Vidal."</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio's heart drops as she listens on the other end with her team. Her palms sweat and there's a sense of betrayal torn anew, learning information she is sure she was never meant to know, shaking the foundations of her relationship with her mother.</p><p>The communications team are wide-eyed and fearful, all of them holding their breath as they stare at Rio.</p><p><em>"It's been a pleasure, Agent Vidal," </em>Paul addresses her directly now.</p><p>
<em>"But I'm afraid the next part of this conversation is private and it'll remain that way unless you'd like your witness back piece by piece."</em>
</p><p>The blood drains from Rio's extremities and her stomach swoops with dread.</p><p>He has Agatha. The moment they lose contact there's no telling what Paul will do; if he moves Agatha to a second location the chances of them recovering her drop drastically.</p><p>They can't talk back to him so they're forced to listen as the operation takes a dire turn.</p><p>
<em>"Goodbye, Agent Vidal."</em>
</p><p>The transmition cuts off shortly after and Rio feels like she's floating adrift in open water.</p><p>"Go," Rio nods hoarsely to Alice, forcing herself to remain calm before she's removed from the operation.</p><p>The other alpha jumps into action, taking three other agents with her as Rio grabs her own keys, heading toward her car.</p><p>She can't let him have Agatha. Despite Paul's threat, Rio knows the alternatives could be so much worse.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Paul rips the necklace from Agatha's neck, leaving a cut against her collarbone and throws the chain to the ground, crushing the pendant beneath his heel.</p><p>Agatha hisses and lifts a hand to her neck but Paul is faster, his large hand wrapping around her neck and gripping her chin until Agatha's face goes red.</p><p>"I should kill you for that little stunt," Paul threatens evenly and Ralph stares in shock until his expression transforms into one of smugness and righteous validation.</p><p>Somehow that's more upsetting than the lack of oxygen.</p><p>Agatha claws at Paul's hand, gasping for breath.</p><p>"You think I got to where I am without being able to spot a trap?" Paul spits and lets Agatha go, the omega gasping and coughing as she rubs at her chest and blinks away choking tears.</p><p>"Can't blame me for trying," Agatha rasps and Paul smirks cruelly.</p><p>"I can't. Like I said, I enjoy you, Agatha," he sighs and his smile drops, transforming his face into one of determined resignation.</p><p>"But unfortunately, I can't tolerate mistakes."</p><p>Paul draws a firearm from his coat pocket, pointing it at Agatha as he turns and steps around the desk to look over Ralph's shoulder at his screen, "You finish your scans?"</p><p>Agatha can hear her own shallow breathing and glances toward the door, wondering if she can edge closer and at least try to make a run for it.</p><p>If he shoots he might hit her but better to be wounded than dead.</p><p>Ralph nods and briefly looks over the results, "Yeah, it's clean."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Agatha watches in slow-motion as Paul swings the pistol around, her heart stopping in fear for her life when the barrel flashes and she blinks and jumps. Agatha screams and expects pain but feels nothing but numb shock.</p><p>Ralph slumps to the side, blood and brain matter on the desk and wall, not even a millisecond for him to process the betrayal; one moment alive and working with supposed allies and the next, gone by their hand.</p><p>Agatha's breathing picks up and she works to control it, though she wants to throw up and burst into tears, clasping her hands over her mouth as if to physically keep everything inside.</p><p>No love is lost and eventually Agatha will accept it was Ralph's decisions that got him killed but in the moment, all she can process is that she just watched her ex-mate die.</p><p>Violently.</p><p>"What the fuck?!" Agatha yells, pressing a hand back against the wall, putting as much space she can between herself and the other alpha.</p><p>Paul reaches carefully over Ralph's body and ejects rhe SD card and pockets it in his coat.</p><p>"I don't like mistakes," Paul reiterates.</p><p>"And losing this was a very big mistake."</p><p>He rounds the desk and hides the pistol in his pocket, taking Agatha's elbow firmly with his free hand.</p><p>"Time to go," he orders, giving her little choice when he pulls her along with an iron grip, heading toward an exit in the opposite direction of where Agatha entered, realizing no one would hear a gunshot over the sounds of the warehouse and thus, screaming would be useless.</p><p>If she runs, there's a chance she might make it to the door and maybe she can get someone in the warehouse to help her but she's too afraid to try in the small hallway.</p><p>Agatha chooses to wait, hoping an opportunity will present itself for her escape or that agents are on their way.</p><p>He leads her to a right turn and a door with a push handle that leads out the back of the building and toward a small non-descript white truck, pushing her into the cabin from the passenger side and climbing in after her, forcing her into the driver's seat.</p><p>Paul removes the pistol from his pocket and points it at her, "Drive."</p><p>Agatha looks at him and the gun then to the keys, hesitating and not wanting to comply.</p><p>Paul leans toward her and pushes the barrel of the gun into her ribs, "Drive."</p><p>Agatha winces and lifts her shaking hands grasping the wheel and the keys, starting the engine and putting the truck into gear.</p><p>Paul directs her toward the growing traffic at the exit lanes as the shift changes to late evening and the day shift workers head home.</p><p>Their white truck blends in perfectly; and as Agatha exits the distribution warehouse onto one of the highway on ramps, she mentally apologizes to Rio, hoping the universe won't make her a liar as she recalls her last words to the woman.</p><p>
<em>"I'll see you soon."</em>
</p><p>
<em>-------------</em>
</p><p>Agatha thinks about driving the truck into the first ditch or telephone pole she spots but Paul seems to read her mind, jabbing the barrel of the gun into her ribs hard enough to bruise and terrifying her enough to maintain the speed limit at least.</p><p>She rides in the slow lane and hopes that pisses someone off enough to grab someone's attention but the most she gets is the occasional honk and rude gesture.</p><p>"Where are we going?" Agatha asks tentatively, trying to gage Paul's state of mind.</p><p>The alpha is calm; much too calm for someone who just murdered a person; not even his scent changes. Ralph's outbursts are predictable; focused on domination and control and quick to anger when things don't go his way.</p><p>Paul is another level above that, stone-faced and practiced in his actions; hard to read as she probes for a weakness.</p><p>"I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise," Paul chuckles.</p><p>"And what about our deal?" Agatha replies, annoyed.</p><p>Anger is the easiest emotion for her to cling to; if she delves any deeper than her surface level anger she might fall apart, primed for a panic attack that she can't afford at the moment.</p><p>"It still applies. So long as you cooperate," Paul replies smoothly.</p><p>"I just needed the chance to tie up a loose end. Ralph was too sloppy," Paul sighs.</p><p>"I never understood why he tried to control you," he shakes his head, "I suppose he felt he had something to prove."</p><p>Agatha can't really argue with that.</p><p>"If he was smart he would have worked with you instead of against you."</p><p>"Is that what you're doing?" Agatha lifts an eyebrow in question.</p><p>Paul tilts his head and shrugs, "I mean, I don't see why we both can't get what we want."</p><p>"What do you want?" Agatha asks.</p><p>"Right now? Anonymity," Paul answers quickly, "The case has gotten too much public attention. I just want to go back to the work that makes me money," he feigns sincerity and humbleness, hiding behind his "older man" persona.</p><p>"Take the next exit," he instructs.</p><p>Agatha merges and gets off the highway reading the exit sign, "To the beach?"</p><p>Paul hums and smirks, "You don't enjoy the ocean?"</p><p>Agatha huffs, irritated at the forced small talk and the casualness of it; how many people has this man killed to move on so quickly?</p><p>"I prefer the mountains," she grumbles and takes another two turns when he instructs, the road eventually narrowing, passing some nicer and larger beach front houses.</p><p>She thinks of Rio and the scent she carries that envelopes her in the steady comfort of solid earth and ancient, unbending trees and her omega aches with uncertainty, needing to fulfill her promise to return to the alpha's side.</p><p>"So you must like the cabin then?" Paul asks, dangling bits of information in front of Agatha, never revealing how much he truly knows but showing just enough to make it clear how dangerous he is.</p><p>Agatha doesn't reply though her heart beat spikes, not wanting to confirm anything in case he is probing for more information, tricking her into revealing more than she intends or confirming rumors he may have heard.</p><p>Agatha is familiar. It's a tactic she's used to great effect in cross examination.</p><p>Paul seems to read her mind, glancing at her knowingly with a hint of pride.</p><p>"You can speak freely," he says, "Like I said, I'd like us to be friends."</p><p>"Like how you and Ralph were?" Agatha snaps, shooting him a glare.</p><p>Paul has her turn onto a private road, only four houses occupy the area, all newly built. She pulls into the driveway of the last house on his intruction and kills the engine.</p><p>The area isn't familiar to her but the construction of the houses screams wealth and she surmises it has to do with Paul's connections, possibly his extra properties he always talked about.</p><p>Paul shrugs, "You're much smarter than he was."</p><p>He turns in his seat to face Agatha, still holding the gun to her ribs.</p><p>"Ralph begged for a chance to join our ranks. He was desperate for power and importance; enough to sacrifice anything for it."</p><p>Agatha winces knowing she is part of that sacrifice.</p><p>"But he never counted on just how stubborn and clever you are," Paul continues and Agatha's skin crawls at the compliment.</p><p>"Ralph was too stupid to figure out the tighter he tried to make your leash, the harder you would fight and you and I both know he wasn't strong enough to win that fight."</p><p>Agatha digs her fingers into the steering wheel. She agrees with him and it pisses her off, uncomfortable with the idea of being on the same side of anything with Paul.</p><p>"Did you just bring me here for a girl power talk or can we wrap up this deal?" Agatha narrows her eyes.</p><p>"I'm offering you something better," Paul cuts to the chase.</p><p>"We're both intelligent people, Agatha. I know you've probably made multiple copies of the videos and <em>you </em>know because of that I can't let you leave this car alive."</p><p>Agatha's palms grow clammy and every time she inhales she's reminded of the gun tightly pressed against her side, threatening to rip apart her chest in an instant.</p><p>Sweat starts to gather near her hairline and Agatha swallows thickly, unable to keep the tremor of fear from trickling into her voice.</p><p>"What do you want?" Agatha asks, turning to look at Paul, studying his face.</p><p>"Take his place," Paul offers.</p><p>"Everything he wanted, I'm offering it to you," he leans into her space and takes her chin between his fingers.</p><p>Agatha inhales through her teeth, her body tensing and her omega snarling in defense.</p><p>"Why?" Agatha snaps, trying to jerk her face away but Paul is persistent.</p><p>"I told you," he shakes his head like he's talking to a toddler; patronizing and purposefully patient.</p><p>"I enjoy you. You're beautiful and smart, and though you're quite outspoken for an omega, I believe that could be an asset for us."</p><p>Paul taps the gun against her side.</p><p>"I don't blame you for finding refuge in another alpha. It's the smartest thing to do for someone in your position and designation."</p><p>Paul scans her face like he's inspecting livestock, turning her head to the side to look at the healed mark at the base of her neck. Agatha resists the urge to snarl, her omega snapping at the intrusion.</p><p>"It really would be a shame to kill you but I don't think you're stupid," Paul stares at her mouth and Agatha flashes her teeth in warning.</p><p>"Come and work for me. You can have everything you want. A career, a family, a chance at a better mate. More power than any omega has had probably in a generation," Paul murmurs.</p><p>His voice is like silk, tempting and soft in its benevolence, offering Agatha everything she dreams of but her brow furrows, his offer catching on the thorn of a caveat.</p><p>"All of that means nothing if I lose my mind," Agatha points out.</p><p>"I'll let you in on a little secret. A trust exercise if you will," Paul whispers and leans forward, his lips brushing her ear.</p><p>"The cure is real."</p><p>Agatha's eyes widen and her breath stutters and Paul grins, close enough to catch it.</p><p>"Why?" Agatha asks breathlessly, "Why make a cure?"</p><p>She can hear the smile in his voice, "The best way to create business is to create a crisis and then offer a solution."</p><p>Agatha connects the dots, understanding all at once. Had Versa not been implicated in the creation of the drug, they would have been hailed as providing the cure for the latest designer pill and making millions in the process.</p><p>It isn't just a trafficking scheme, but a money producing one at that.</p><p>Agatha is almost in awe of the magnitude of their operation; simple and efficient and nearly foolproof if not for some key mistakes that lead to the company's unraveling.</p><p>"So I get the cure and the life of my dreams and what do you get?" Agatha asks with trepidation.</p><p>Her body vibrates with anxiety, torn between revulsion and curiosity, unable to outright ignore the temptation being offered.</p><p>"You," Paul growls, punctuating his demand when he lifts the gun from her ribs to press against her faded mark, putting pressure on the scent gland there and triggering an involuntarily release of pheromones as Agatha chokes on a yelp.</p><p>"I'm not expecting romance or love and I doubt after your experience you expect it either," Paul rubs his thumb over her jaw.</p><p>"We're both practical people; I want to sire my heirs with someone who will produce strong offspring. You want a family and a career and freedom from reproach. So long as you don't interfere with my business, that freedom is yours," Paul's breath is close enough that Agatha can feel it on her cheek.</p><p>She doesn't have to ask what will happen if she refuses, it's heavily implied there is only one right choice to make but Agatha can't help but think about Rio and the warmth that comes in the safety of her arms and tries to imagine getting the same from Paul, her omega recoiling in disgust.</p><p>It's the terrible curse of knowing; now that Agatha knows what it's like to be cared for, it's impossible for her to imagine a life absent of affection.</p><p>But in the face of her own mortality, Agatha finds her pride crumbling.</p><p>Paul brushes the barrel of the gun against her neck, teasing her scent gland and drawing unwanted reactions from her omega; bowing her head in submission and releasing her scent in order to survive.</p><p>"How do I know you won't turn out just like him?" Agatha asks, lowering her eyes.</p><p>Paul takes it as a sign of Agatha's failing resolve and gets bolder with his liberties, pressing his lips against the skin of her cheek.</p><p>Agatha wants to turn her head and bite but her terror keeps her still.</p><p>"Because I reward good behavior," he growls.</p><p>"You see this house?"</p><p>Agatha glances out the windshield.</p><p>"This was Ralph's. A gift for completing the research we requested," Paul explains.</p><p>"It's yours now."</p><p>Agatha's expression morphs into one of disbelief, she trusts nothing coming from his mouth and Paul's expression softens.</p><p>"You did everything right and all he wanted to do was keep you in a cage," Paul tsks and eyes the scar at the base of her neck, licking his lips.</p><p>"A mark is enough for me."</p><p>'<em>Trading a cage for a leash,'</em> Agatha thinks bitterly.</p><p>His scent blankets her and Agatha chokes on it, desperate for a breath of clean air.</p><p>He lowers his gun, holding it aimlessly between them near her stomach, more comfortable with the power he wields against her and the lack of resistance from Agatha.</p><p>His rough thumb brushes over her scent gland and an involuntarily tremor runs through Agatha's body. He presses down harder, playing her reactions and demonstrating just how familiar he is with manipulating omegas to his will.</p><p>Agatha's breaths come in shallow gasps, her omega confused and overstimulated as her body responds biologically, ready to submit and give herself over but her mind and her omega resist, pushing back against this intruder who tries to take up space already reserved for another.</p><p>"It doesn't have to be so hard," Paul murmurs, releasing his own pheromones that have Agatha blinking heavily, effectively tranquilizing her omega's resistance.</p><p>"I don't want to hurt you or control you. I want to give you everything you deserve. You have so much potential," Paul leans down and presses his lips over his thumb and the soft touch makes Agatha mewl in response, clenching her jaw and folding her lips over her teeth to muffle the sound.</p><p>Paul can hear her though and he knows he's won.</p><p>Agatha's resistance grinds down to nothing, her omega submitting and metaphorically rolling over for the alpha who challenges her unclaimed status.</p><p>She swallows hard and parts her lips.</p><p>"Okay," she whispers, unable to bring herself to look at him.</p><p>Paul's grin is triumphant and he surges forward, taking a single word as if it's a flag on a piece of land, claiming her lips roughly as she winces and fights the urge to gag.</p><p>She can smell the change in his scent and her stomach turns as he presses forward, eager to get his hands on her body, discarding his gun on the dashboard in favor of groping at her thigh.</p><p>It feels like ages but in reality it's only a few seconds.</p><p>Once his gun leaves his hand the passenger door is ripped open and Paul is yanked backward and thrown to the ground, yelling in surprise and thrashing against his unknown attacker.</p><p>Agatha jumps as she's startled, her back pressing to the driver's side door in momentary fear until she recognizes Rio kneeling on Paul's back, restraining him with zipties.</p><p>A handful of other agents swarm and remove Agatha from the cabin of the truck, placing her in the back of a sedan for the time being though she refuses to lose sight of the other woman.</p><p>Paul doesn't yell as he's arrested but he does look around and Agatha is ashamed of herself when she ducks down but her mind and body are still locked in survival mode and she wishes she had something to hold as her fingers continuously flex open and closed; raw adrenaline with no where to go.</p><p>Rio hands off the arrest frantically and scans the area, nose turned high to the air for Agatha's scent and yelling to another agent who directs her to the sedan finding Agatha in seconds, and yanking the door open, half-launching herself at the other woman who eagerly clings to Rio.</p><p>"What took you so long," Agatha gasps.</p><p>She means it to be sarcastic but what's supposed to be a laugh turns into a sob as her fingers twist in Rio's jacket and the alpha crushes her in her embrace.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio apologizes breathlessly, trying her best to meld the omega into her body, unable to get close enough to reassure Agatha that she's safe; that it's over.</p><p>"It's done," Rio continues to murmur.</p><p>"We got him, you're safe."</p><p>Alice joins them after a few minutes, reluctant to interrupt but forced to out of necessity.</p><p>"Hey," Alice greets before putting a gentle hand on Rio's shoulder to get her attention.</p><p>The alpha looks up and stands up straight again, not really embarrassed about the display of affection but pulled back to the reality of the situation; there is still follow up to complete and procedure to follow to make sure everything entered into evidence will be admissible in court.</p><p>"We gotta head back to the office," Alice informs Rio then turns to Agatha and holds out her hand.</p><p>"I can take the wire back to comms."</p><p>Agatha exhales and shakily reaches for the second button on her jacket, unpinning it and placing it in Alice's palm.</p><p>The back up wire had been Rio's idea, using the necklace as a decoy to give Ralph, or in this case Paul, a false sense of security; playing into their sense of superiority to draw attention away from their back up.</p><p>Agatha is grateful. Without it, who knows how long it would have been before the agents could track her down and by that time, Agatha is sure she would have been forced to do things she would regret.</p><p>Her skin crawls again and she seeks out Rio's gaze.</p><p>"I need to change," she says, voice firm though Rio picks up on the underlying plea.</p><p>Rio can smell him on her; can hear his voice in her ear as he taunted and coerced Agatha into a corner, the dangerously lecherous tone sparking Rio's territorial urges as she imagines cutting off his hands and hanging them around his neck as a warning.</p><p>In her darker imaginings, Rio wants to climb into the back of the sedan and pin Agatha down and fuck her until she remembers that her place is beneath Rio; screaming her name until Agatha forgets every other touch but hers.</p><p>Rio knows Agatha has done nothing wrong but the image of Paul on top of her, putting his mouth and hands where they don't belong has Rio's alpha furious and anxious to reassert her claim.</p><p>She clenches her fist, squeezing tightly as she stuffs down the urge, hearing his taunting words testing her temper.</p><p>"I'll drive you back," Rio jerks her chin toward her car and Agatha follows, still too much in shock to realize anything amiss with the alpha.</p><p>As much as Rio is preoccupied with her own urges, Agatha battles with her guilt for the same reason, knowing she only did what she did because of the threat of death but she feels dirty, like she betrayed the alpha and carries his scent as evidence.</p><p>Agatha folds her arms over her middle as Rio speeds through evening traffic. She finally notices the smoky scent of Rio's ire and though she knows it isn't directed at her, Agatha's inner omega reacts instinctually, cowering and remorseful.</p><p>Despite both of their scents, Paul's lingers like a splinter in Rio's foot; irritating and painful and driving her toward madness as she obsesses about digging it out even to the point of deepening the wound in a bid for relief.</p><p>"There's enough time if you want to shower," Rio offers when Paul's scent starts to burrow further under her skin.</p><p>Agatha squeezes her waist tighter and grimaces, "Is it bad?"</p><p>A shower actually sounds wonderful. Maybe scalding hot water will burn away the memory of his mouth as well as his scent.</p><p>Rio pokes her tongue against her cheek, lowering her eyes for a moment with a contrite nod as Agatha ducks her head and looks out the window, watching the scenery fly by until the buildings take on a familiar color and size.</p><p>Once inside the building, Rio leads Agatha to one of the locker rooms equipped with showers and stops in front of a locker with her last name on it, passing Agatha the travel-size body wash and an extra set of gym clothes.</p><p>"I'll be here," Rio promises, taking a seat on the benches and nodding to where the shower stalls are and once again she stamps down the desire to follow and jump the omega; smothering her against cold tile as her cock pushes against the walls of her cunt until the other woman begs for mercy.</p><p>Rio huffs a breath through her nose and crosses her legs, battling back her alpha in an effort not to prove Paul right.</p><p>It's that thought that helps Rio maintain her self-control.</p><p>Rio can hear the shower water running and soon the smell of her body wash drifts into the air; Agatha's own scent hides beneath as Rio breathes deeply in relief.</p><p>Rio checks her phone for any updates. Alice texts her that Paul is being processed now and she receives an update from Yelena that they're still combing the warehouse and collecting evidence before Ralph's body is removed.</p><p>She hasn't seen the crime scene. Rio's focus had been solely on Agatha but she can imagine the sort of shock the omega will experience later when she begins to process what she witnessed.</p><p>Despite Rio's belief that Ralph's fate is deserved, she's hyper aware of the possibility that Agatha may not feel the same.</p><p>She did love him, after all.</p><p>By the time Agatha finishes, Rio has been ruminating, her thoughts bouncing between Ralph and Paul and how fucking <em>pissed</em> she is that they've both had their hands on Agatha as her alpha snaps territorially.</p><p>Agatha walks into a thick cloud of Rio's scent when she finds the alpha again and she's hit with another wave of guilt so strong it sends Agatha to her knees on the floor in front of a stunned and confused Rio.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Agatha says quickly, placing her hand on Rio's knee.</p><p>"I can fix it," she says hurriedly, looking up at the alpha with such fear that Rio's heart breaks.</p><p>Agatha trusts her, she cares what Rio thinks and wants her approval and Rio wants to cry as she imagines Agatha as a kid, begging her mother for a chance to right her wrongs, fearful of losing the connection she so desperately wants.</p><p>Agatha's hands travel suggestively up Rio's legs and the alpha stops her gently, placing her hands over Agatha's.</p><p>"Nothing is broken," Rio presses her lips together to keep her tears at bay and lifts her hands to frame Agatha's face, holding her still so Rio can lean down and mold her lips against Agatha's; a much gentler reclaiming as her alpha willingly adjusts to what Agatha needs.</p><p>It's Agatha who deepens the kiss, surging forward on her knees, seeking out a firmer pressure as her tongue demands entrance against the seam of Rio's lips.</p><p>Rio lets her take what she needs, matching her fervor and allowing a bit of her alpha to come forward, sucking lewdly on Agatha's tongue and grazing her teeth over the swell of her bottom lip.</p><p>Agatha whimpers and Rio can smell the desperation in her scent, ripping her mouth away and panting, noticing that Agatha has fitted herself between Rio's legs at some point, pressing her body as close as she can.</p><p>"What do you need?" Rio asks breathlessly.</p><p>"You," Agatha answers without hesitation.</p><p>Rio can't refuse, not when her thoughts have been running so close to possessiveness, and when Agatha's scent turns plaintive and wanting, Rio pulls her up by the elbows, kissing the omega hard enough to send her back against the lockers.</p><p>The sound makes Rio hesitate for a second but Agatha's roaming hands bring her attention back to the moment as agile fingers reach for her tucked shirt and the zipper of her pants.</p><p>"Quick and quiet," Rio growls and Agatha nods.</p><p>Rio eyes the door for a second and reaches for Agatha's hips, turning the omega to face the lockers as she pulls both underwear and sweats down to just below the swell of Agatha's ass.</p><p>Leaning back to take herself in hand, Rio pumps her fist quickly and drags the head of her cock against Agatha's slit, parting the lips of her cunt as Agatha arches her hips and bites her lip to stifle a whimper.</p><p>Agatha wants more than this; she wants to make a nest and hide away with the alpha until she's unable to tell their scents apart but the obligations of real life demand their attention and Agatha will take what she can get for now to quell her omega's demands to rid itself of Paul's influence.</p><p>Agatha inhales deeply; a wave of relief and arousal rippling across her skin, responding eagerly as her cunt grows slick in anticipation.</p><p>"Hush," Rio growls as Agatha lets out a needy whine when the alpha pushes past the entrance to her cunt, stretching and sliding until her hips press against Agatha's ass.</p><p>Agatha's hands press against the lockers as she grinds her hips back against Rio, humming quietly in satisfaction as she spreads her legs as much as she can with her clothes restricting her movement.</p><p>Rio brings her hands to Agatha's hips, taking over the pace and moving Agatha the way she wants and Agatha surrenders easily to Rio's direction, driving the alpha's desire to claim and use the omega because Agatha is <em>hers.</em></p><p>Agatha pants quietly and nearly yelps when Rio surges forward, using short sharp thrusts to target the sensitive spot near the entrance of her cunt, clamping her hand over her mouth when Rio's fingers dig into her hips in warning.</p><p>Rio bites her lip to stifle her own groan, leaving the lewd sounds of skin against skin to fill her ears. The idea that someone might walk in to see them, Rio with her cock buried to the hilt and Agatha trying not to moan, clearly staking her claim, makes Rio swell and she thinks about slipping her hand between Agatha's legs but a darker, more possessive thought crosses her mind.</p><p>Rio holds Agatha still as she pistons her hips faster, her stomach and legs tensing as she uses Agatha's cunt to make herself come.</p><p>Agatha bites down on her own fingers and squeezes her eyes shut; the rougher cadence satisfies her need to atone and the pleasure feels like a reward, like she's done something right.</p><p>Agatha reaches between her legs, seeking out her clit out of habit but startles when Rio pulls her hand away, holding her wrist and arm taut behind her.</p><p>"No," Rio chastises, choking as she struggles to keep herself quiet.</p><p>The alpha fills Agatha's cunt, burying herself as deep as possible as she comes, rocking forward each time her muscles clench and her cock twitches, spilling inside Agatha's warmth as the muscles of her cunt pulse and tremble with unfulfilled desire.</p><p>Rio withdraws slowly, making sure to drag her cock against Agatha's clit when she slips out, smirking when Agatha's hips jump and try to chase the sensation.</p><p>Instead, Rio pulls up Agatha's underwear and sweats, leaning forward to kiss the omega's cheek and press her nose against Agatha's temple when she gasps and turns to look over her shoulder in protest.</p><p>Rio wraps her arms around Agatha, pulling her tightly against her front.</p><p>"Any time someone mentions another alpha to you, I want you to remember whose cum is dripping between your legs," Rio's voice rumbles in her chest and Agatha moans, goosebumps rising on her arms.</p><p>She isn't even upset about her denied orgasm; not when Agatha revels in the feeling of being both desired and submissive, trusting that Rio will take care of her in her vulnerable state.</p><p>Rio lets Agatha go after a while and puts herself back together, trying to scrounge up whatever decency is left on the floor where she discarded it, blushing a bit in the aftermath when she realizes what her desire for this woman makes her do.</p><p>She's never considered locker room sex before but Rio guesses there's a first time for everything.</p><p>Agatha turns around and snakes her arms around Rio, burying her nose against the curve of her neck as if gathering the strength to face the world outside the door.</p><p>Rio understands. Her refuge is found in these quiet moments and though the ordeal is over, their resolve will continue to be tested as the investigation pushes forward.</p><p>Agatha sighs and Rio is in no rush, savoring the moment of peace.</p><p>All the while her alpha growls happily, chanting</p><p>'<em>mine, mine, mine.'</em></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The rest of the night passes excruciatingly slow.</p><p>Agatha retells the events from her point of view, repeating and answering questions when asked.</p><p>Right now she feels detached from what happened, like an observer outside of her body, clinically describing the sequence of events which helps her focus, and when she starts to get overwhelmed, Agatha presses her legs together and bites her lip, recalling Rio's words and distracting herself enough to regain control over her emotions.</p><p>It's especially useful when another agent is tasked with taking Agatha's statements; the team swapping out Rio to cover their metaphorical bases, not wanting to give the defense any leeway to argue against their evidence.</p><p>With her omega being so needy, Agatha gets restless without Rio's scent around and in a separate conference room, Rio is the same, crossing her legs and shaking her foot with anxious energy, trying to reason with her alpha that Agatha is close by and she will see her soon.</p><p>Rio's alpha still persists, wanting to return to Agatha's side and make sure her scent clings to the omega.</p><p>More than that, she wants to sink her teeth into Agatha's neck just to be sure there is no mistaking who Agatha belongs to.</p><p>Rio snorts and huffs quietly, reprimanding her alpha and trying to wrestle back control of her instinctual urges, repeating Paul's words in her head like a mantra to keep the beast at bay.</p><p>
<em>"Like father like daughter, no?"</em>
</p><p>Rio feels a spike of rage. There is so much she didn't know about her father; so much that her mother kept from her.</p><p>Logically she understands she was young at the time and her mother was trying to protect her.</p><p><em>She's probably still trying to, </em>Rio thinks. Probably making up for the times she couldn't during Rio's childhood.</p><p>But a small part of Rio stings knowing her mother kept this information from her. Not that Rio could do anything with it, but at the very least she wants her mother to be able to put this burden down.</p><p>She's an adult now, Rio wants to be able to protect her mother, too.</p><p>Rio starts to nibble on her thumbnail nervously then abruptly stops, fighting her smile when she realizes it's Agatha's habit she picked up. As much as she's rubbed off on Agatha, Agatha has influenced her equally.</p><p><em>Maybe even more</em>, Rio muses, thinking about how her very foundation has shifted since meeting Agatha, unable to ignore the pull toward the omega like being sucked toward a black hole.</p><p>Her thoughts, her decisions, her feelings all orbit around Agatha, treading the line of obsession; unsure if her reactions are normal or enhanced due to her parentage.</p><p>Rio makes a note to talk to Alice at some point, looking across the table at her partner who looks as tired as Rio feels.</p><p>They've both been so busy and Rio has been so wrapped around Agatha that a part of her feels guilty for neglecting her friend. And maybe she can talk to the other woman, alpha to alpha, and see if she's overreacting or not.</p><p>As much as Rio loves her mother and confides in Agatha, the obsessive and possessive tendencies of alphas are better understood by others in her designation. It only concerns Rio because she's never defaulted so easily to her baser instincts, not even with her previous partner that the alpha had considered claiming, still able to maintain control throughout their relationship.</p><p>By simply existing, Agatha wrecks Rio's carefully curated defenses.</p><p>Through her distracted musings, Rio catches snippets of her team discussing another vial found on Ralph's body and Rio remembers that Paul admitted the cure is real.</p><p>Rio's chest feels like it expands, mind racing to the future that had previously felt out of reach, visions suddenly coming to her in sharp relief, bright with color and happiness and laughter</p><p>And love.</p><p>The earthquake of a realization creates a small crack in the dam Rio has built to hold back her feelings and later she'll attribute it to stress and exhaustion, but the dam breaks and Rio feels like she's being tortured in the sweetest way, finding freedom in finally allowing herself to acknowledge her feelings though their strength and intensity intimidate her.</p><p>Part of Rio's torture is coming to this realization while sitting quietly at a conference room table, debriefing and planning next steps with her team while Agatha sits in a room down the hall.</p><p>Another topic of discussion is whether or not Agatha needs FBI assigned protection at this point.</p><p>Rio does her best not to jump in to immediately insist her protection continue. Mostly she's afraid of losing her excuse to be around Agatha all the time, but with Paul in custody and Ralph dead, the threat to Agatha is considered less of a priority.</p><p>When her team start to eye her for her silence, Rio levels out her voice to be as professional as possible and points out the threat might still exist.</p><p>Paul knows there is a cabin, who knows if he knows where it is or if he set anything into motion before his arrest. He's already proven to have a far reach and their protection should extend until the trial at least.</p><p>They discuss and Rio's team leader agrees to extend the personal protection until the end of the trial, ordering Rio to take herself and Agatha out of the cabin and arranging for another safe house closer to town.</p><p>The order is effective immediately which makes Rio groan internally, knowing it will add time to their already long night but she won't take chances with Agatha's safety so she swallows her grumbling and nods in agreement.</p><p>When they're finally released, Rio makes her way toward interrogation, stepping into the viewing room and watching one of her teammates on the tail end of debriefing with Agatha.</p><p>She sticks her hands in her pockets, listening in as she waits for the omega.</p><p>"And what happened after you accepted his offer?" The agent questions, voice devoid of bias or inflection.</p><p>Agatha stares straight ahead, her hands clasped together and tucked between her knees, clearly tired by the way her shoulders slump and her eyes squint.</p><p>"He leaned forward and put his mouth on mine and pushed his thumb against my...neck," Agatha swallows and the muscle of her jaw twitches as she clenches her teeth.</p><p>"Then he was suddenly gone and I realized the police had arrived."</p><p>Rio bristles and even though she feels like she could burn entire fields with how angry she is, her alpha more so yearns for the other woman, not so much sexually, though there always seems to be an underlying desire, but her alpha wants to cradle her until all her wounds are healed.</p><p>She eyes the cut at Agatha's neck and again feels her alpha bare her teeth, aching to mark the omega permanently.</p><p><em>Maybe</em>, Rio thinks to herself, trying to soothe her alpha, feeding it bits of hope now that she can see a way forward.</p><p>The agent finishes with Agatha and leads her toward the holding area and Rio meets them there, heart speeding up when she notices how Agatha's eyes settle on her and seem to spark back to life.</p><p>"We have to grab our stuff from the cabin," Rio updates Agatha who frowns and crosses her arms over her chest.</p><p>"We're gonna move you to a new safe house closer to town," she explains and Agatha seems to relax and nods, following Rio out toward her sedan.</p><p>The mood in the car is lighter though a different kind of tension exists between them that has more to do with their unwillingness to leave one another than the events of the past evening.</p><p>Agatha does experience a bit of regret leaving the cabin as she collects her things. They've spent time there and it's the place where she and Rio first came together.</p><p>It almost felt like a home.</p><p>She can feel the alpha's presence the same time her scent fills her nose as she folds her clothes and relaxes into Rio's arms when they snake around her waist, resting her arms over the other woman's.</p><p>Rio rests her chin on Agatha's shoulder and leans her head against the omega's.</p><p>"I was hoping a magic wand would wave and things could go back to normal immediately," Agatha confides and Rio squeezes her gently.</p><p>"One step closer," Rio hums and turns to kiss Agatha's cheek then her jaw.</p><p>Agatha sighs deeply and tilts her head, eyes slipping shut both in pleasure and exhaustion. Rio spots the cut on Agatha's neck and presses her lips over it, feeling the tremor that runs through the other woman's body.</p><p>Rio can't bite her from this angle, though her alpha wants to try, so she shifts her mouth to safer territory, nipping at the back of Agatha's shoulder and smiling when the other woman pouts adorably.</p><p>"I'm tired," Agatha whines though she leans back against Rio.</p><p>"Is that a no or are you upset because you're tired and you want to?" Rio nuzzles the back of Agatha's neck, burying her nose in her hair and rubbing her face against the soft waves.</p><p>"Second one," Agatha grumbles, tilting her head back, eyes still closed.</p><p>"Take a nap," Rio offers. "I can pack up the rest."</p><p>Agatha hesitates for a moment but Rio nudges her toward the bed and Agatha can't deny the temptation and crawls under the covers.</p><p>"I'll wake you up when it's time to go," Rio promises and Agatha is out in seconds, falling into much needed sleep.</p><p>Rio does as she promised, cleaning up the place and packing their things, doing a few sweeps to make sure they haven't forgotten anything. When she finishes, Rio hops on to her laptop to give Agatha a couple more hours of rest.</p><p>With Paul in custody, new warrants have been submitted to search his assets and seize any data they find for evidence. As predicted, he's lawyered up immediately and the DA intends to fight for no bail based on the danger he poses to others and the flight risk.</p><p>Rio reviews Agatha's typed out statement, correlated with time stamps from the wire recording; the alpha's emotions fluctuate as she reads the statement in Agatha's voice, forced into Agatha's point of view and trying to imagine someone physically manipulating her the same way Paul was able to control the omega's body.</p><p>It's difficult for Rio to imagine which only highlights the gap between the designations. An omega might be able to seduce an alpha, enticing them with their scent but even then, it's far easier for an alpha to regain control than it seems to be for an omega to try and resist.</p><p>She mourns the unfairness of it all.</p><p>The last couple of emails come with instructions for them to switch out teams, giving Rio and Alice and a few other agents some time off to recover before returning to the investigation.</p><p>The address of a new safe house is sent to Rio's phone after a safety sweep is done, giving them a new destination for the next stage of the investigation.</p><p>Rio sighs and wonders if all of her plants at home have died yet.</p><p>The alpha climbs the stairs to the loft, spotting the outline of Agatha's shoulders and hips under the covers and moves to the omega's side, sliding a hand over Agatha's waist.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio leans down, trying to call the other woman back to consciousness.</p><p>Rio rubs her hand firmly over Agatha's side and back, gently coaxing her awake but Agatha's brow furrows, her subconscious clinging to sleep as she rolls over, back facing Rio with a mumbled complaint.</p><p>"We have to go," Rio chases after Agatha, draging her nails over Agatha's back which only seems to lull the omega back to sleep.</p><p>Huffing in amusement and frustration, Rio moves to the foot of the bed and slowly starts to pull the covers away, prompting a whine from the omega as she grabs the other pillow and wraps her arms and legs around it tightly.</p><p>Rio chuckles and slides halfway onto the mattress, squeezing Agatha's hip.</p><p>"Aaagathaaa," Rio coos, grinning when the other woman grunts in irritation.</p><p>Rio's hand passes back and forth over the swell of Agatha's ass and the omega sighs and cuddles back into Rio's touch, hoping to return to sleep.</p><p>After a few passes, Rio snakes her hand beneath the top of Agatha's sweat pants, expecting to encounter underwear but surprised to find only skin.</p><p>Rio smirks and shakes her head, slipping her hand between Agatha's legs from behind, using her middle finger to press lightly against the warm lips of her cunt.</p><p>Agatha hums and shifts but Rio follows, tracing the seam of her cunt until just the slightest bit of arousal touches Rio's fingertips.</p><p>Agatha huffs and hugs the pillow tighter, burying her face as she fights between her body's desire and her mind's demand for rest.</p><p>Rio dips her fingertip between Agatha's folds, spreading and gathering her wetness, lazily tracing from the bottom of Agatha's entrance to the hood of her clit, feeling her cunt twitch as Agatha cries out quietly into her pillow.</p><p>Rio pulls away to tug at Agatha's sweats, turning the other woman onto her back and dragging them easily down her legs and tossing them aside.</p><p>She can tell Agatha is mostly awake by the sound of her breathing and the way her fingers curl into her pillow but her eyes remain stubbornly closed, like an unspoken challenge for the alpha.</p><p>Rio fits herself between Agatha's legs, laying on her stomach and pushing pale thighs apart, holding Agatha open as Rio lowers her mouth to Agatha's cunt, dragging the length of her tongue over her with deliberate intent.</p><p>Agatha inhales shakily and one of her hands falls to her stomach, clutching aimlessly until Rio takes pity and laces their fingers together.</p><p>Rio flattens her tongue over Agatha's clit, playing with the amount of pressure, teasing with light circles before sucking deeply and drawing a low moan from Agatha's throat.</p><p>Rio brings her fingers to her lips, sucking on them until they're wet and when she's satisfied, Rio returns her glistening fingers to Agatha's weeping cunt and teases her entrance, holding her open as she slides two fingers inside.</p><p>Agatha gasps, her chest lifting toward the ceiling as her cunt floods with arousal, eagerly accepting the alpha as Rio curls her fingers upward and brings her tongue back to Agatha's clit.</p><p>Agatha whimpers, her chest rising and falling with labored breath as her stomach jumps each time her pleasure spikes while her free hand travels to her chest, squeezing and pinching over her shirt and bra, adding kindling to a quickly growing fire that burns through her every nerve.</p><p>Rio hums at the sight and flicks her tongue faster, moving her fingers at a steady pace, seeking out the rigid patch of flesh against the walls of her cunt and pressing firmly against it as Rio sucks Agatha's swollen clit between her lips.</p><p>Agatha's cries rise in pitch and her fingertips dig into Rio's hand, turning white with pressure as her toes curl against the mattress and her thighs begin to tremble, her body growing taut and edging closer to release, gasping when she remembers to breathe.</p><p>Rio moves her fingers and tongue in tandem, gradually building the pace when she feels the walls of Agatha's cunt flutter and her body elongates and arcs, hovering just at the edge of climax before the coiled pleasure snaps, her stomach tensing as her cunt squeezes around Rio's fingers.</p><p>The alpha softens her tongue, flicking gently and curling her fingers, refusing to relent and chasing the tails of pleasure, pushing Agatha into a second weaker orgasm, drawing a proper moan from the omega's lips.</p><p>Agatha circles and bucks her hips, toes curling as she lifts her leg, digging her heel into Rio's back, her free hand flailing and darting between pressing against her stomach, pushing Rio's head, and clutching at the mattress when the alpha refuses to stop.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha whines, her body heading toward overstimulation as she jerks away from Rio's mouth but the alpha curls her arms around Agatha's thighs, holding her tightly and sealing her lips against Agatha's cunt.</p><p>"I can't," Agatha whimpers, gripping Rio's fingers so hard they ache, slamming her other hand down against the mattress and flexing her fingers.</p><p>"I can't, I can't, I can't," Agatha babbles and her back arcs off the bed, her head falling back as her lips part in silent cry, the tendons of her neck taut and flexing as her final orgasm slams into her like a brick wall and her hips buck sharply as she digs her heels into the mattress, pushing herself up the bed as her cunt pulses.</p><p>"No more! No more!" Agatha pants, body twitching with aftershocks of her climax as she presses her legs together.</p><p>Rio relents, licking her lips and swiping at her chin with the back of her hand, a self-satisfied smirk gracing her features as Agatha's eyes open, hazy and blown as she blinks slowly.</p><p>"Time to wake up," Rio sings sweetly, grinning down at the omega.</p><p>"Fuck," Agatha breathes and Rio chuckles.</p><p>The alpha helps Agatha sit up when her breathing evens out and kisses her softly, grabbing a change of clothes for her from their packed things.</p><p>"Where did your underwear go?" Rio asks curiously as Agatha slips her legs into a new pair.</p><p>"I took them off. They were ruined," Agatha glares pointedly at Rio who puffs her chest in pride.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and finishes dressing, following Rio downstairs after she's assured Rio packed everything.</p><p>After a final sweep, they climb back into the car, leaving the cabin behind and driving back toward the city in the middle of the night.</p><p>-------------</p><p>By the time they make it to the next safe house, a small one bedroom house on the edge of the city, there isn't much time to explore as Rio's energy fades, forcing them to seek out the bedroom first.</p><p>Rio takes off her shoes, her shirt, and her pants and nearly face plants on the bed, not bothering to pull back the covers or take out her hair, simply curling up on her side and holding out an arm, beckoning Agatha closer to join her.</p><p>Agatha smirks and changes into shorts and a sleep shirt. She rounds the bed and takes out Rio's hair, smoothing her hands over soft inky strands and tugging the covers out from under Rio to pull them over the alpha as she climbs in beside the other woman.</p><p>Rio pulls Agatha against her body like she's her own personal body pillow and though normally Agatha would roll her eyes and try to reclaim some space, after the close call and the memory of Paul's hands on her body, Agatha welcomes Rio's needy grasp.</p><p>She wants to be taken and held and kept; all things Agatha has rejected from any other alpha, including Ralph, feeling trapped by the notion of being claimed though she had tried to make the best of her situation.</p><p>Alphas who approached her, she now knows, always did so one of two ways. Either they demanded her immediate submission or they hid their intent to tame and own.</p><p>Rio falls somewhere in between. She had tried to suppress those urges and only when Agatha had demanded, did Rio plainly state her desire to <em>have</em> Agatha in every way, giving Agatha the choice to come to her that Agatha had made willingly.</p><p>It occurs to Agatha that every time she's submitted to Rio, it had been her choice to do so.</p><p>The alpha snores lightly, twitching occasionally in her sleep. Agatha turns over and Rio shifts with her, ending up with her head on Agatha's chest with an arm sprawled over her waist. Agatha turns and presses her lips against Rio's hair and the alpha sighs in her sleep as something deep tugs in Agatha's gut, aching to be tied to the alpha in every way possible.</p><p>The scent gland at her neck seems to itch or maybe it's Agatha projecting, but she wants to feel the pain of teeth piercing flesh and be able to trace her fingers over a raised scar, proud for the first time to sport a mark.</p><p>Rio's breathing and her weight on Agatha eventually lull the omega back to sleep, drifting toward slumber as she clings to the fantasy of falling in love.</p><p>-------------</p><p>When Rio wakes, she's warm and comfortable, wrapped around what's either a pillow or Agatha.</p><p>She rubs her cheek against the nearest surface and the warmth and soft hum that greets her makes Rio sigh in return.</p><p>Rio can tell the moment Agatha comes to consciousness when her body tenses but after a moment she seems to remember where she is and how she got there and relaxes into Rio, turning over and hiding her face in the curve of Rio's shoulder.</p><p>There's no rush; Rio has time off and with the investigation continuing with potential new evidence, she knows all of it will take time to collect and process.</p><p>They aren't out of the woods yet but the respite is welcomed.</p><p>Rio rubs her hand up and down Agatha's back, aware how easy it would be to steer them toward sex but other than the short conversation at the cabin, they haven't talked and Rio wants to know what the other woman is feeling.</p><p>She's read Agatha's statement but obviously what is on paper won't reflect the omega's true thoughts and Rio worries Agatha will regress back into burying her feelings after the intense stress.</p><p>Agatha stirs, her mouth sucking gently on the base of Rio's neck as her knee slips between Rio's legs.</p><p>Rio hums, "Morning."</p><p>Agatha hums her acknowledgement and continues making a trail to Rio's ear, pressing the length of her body against the alpha.</p><p>Before she gets swept away by desire, Rio wants to be sure Agatha is okay. She misses Agatha's voice and the omega has been unusually quiet which is understandable considering what Agatha went through but it sets off a warning in Rio's head.</p><p>Rio leans back and smooths Agatha's hair away from her face, getting a proper look at her in the late morning light.</p><p>Agatha's face is paler than usual and circles are starting to form under her eyes. There's a gathering storm in the blue of her eyes that Rio wants to diffuse so she heads straight into the rain to confront the clouds.</p><p>"You okay, baby?"</p><p>It's spoken with such tenderness that at first Agatha looks offended, narrowing her eyes and searching Rio's face suspiciously for any hint of mockery.</p><p>The alpha watches as all the scathing remarks Agatha has at the tip of her tongue melt away when the corners of her eyes relax and she diverts her gaze away.</p><p>"I don't know," Agatha answers honestly, picking at the neckline of Rio's sports bra absently.</p><p>"I don't think it's hit me that Ralph is dead," she continues timidly.</p><p>"And..." Agatha hesitates, eyes darting to Rio's for a second then away.</p><p>"I wish you had killed Paul."</p><p>Agatha looks guilty, but not for wishing someone dead, but because she's holding something back.</p><p>Rio furrows her brow and Agatha squirms under the scrutiny, uncomfortable with how transparent she feels under Rio's gaze.</p><p>"Tell me," Rio urges and Agatha presses her lips together.</p><p>"I'd rather fuck you," Agatha replies candidly.</p><p>"To forget?" Rio asks, her question tinged with sadness.</p><p>If Agatha wants to use sex to escape her thoughts, Rio can't really find it in herself to stop her but she doesn't want to be used like that; at least not at the moment.</p><p>"To forget <em>him," </em>Agatha clarifies, tracing her fingers lower over Rio's chest, still weakly trying to entice the alpha.</p><p>Rio places her hand over Agatha's, flattening Agatha's palm against her chest.</p><p>"He's never going to touch you again," Rio promises adamantly, eyes hardening to amber with anger.</p><p>The alpha's scent grows smoky and Agatha responds instinctually, her pheromones growing submissive as she presses her body against Rio's again in supplication.</p><p>Rio scoots back when she inhales, eyes widening a fraction in realization.</p><p>"I'm setting you off aren't I?" Rio asks though she knows the answer even before Agatha bites her bottom lip guiltily.</p><p>Rio had been so preoccupied with stifling her urge to claim the omega that controlling her pheromones had fallen to the back of her mind and she immediately feels bad for not recognizing the signs earlier, unintentionally triggering Agatha's submission.</p><p>Dread settles in her stomach, wondering if she's <em>forced </em>Agatha into submission.</p><p>
<em>Like father, like daughter, no?</em>
</p><p>Rio sits up, letting the sheet pool in her lap. Her jealousy and possessiveness got the better of her and, despite her intentions, Rio still ended up trying to control the other woman.</p><p>Her scent changes again, signaling her distress and Agatha sits up after her, reaching out to frame Rio's face with her hands.</p><p>"I'm- You're not-" Agatha huffs in frustration as she tries to find the words to soothe the alpha.</p><p>"If you're setting me off," Agatha pushes the words out haltingly, "It's okay."</p><p>Rio shoots Agatha a glare and opens her mouth to protest but Agatha cuts her off.</p><p>"I like it."</p><p>Rio freezes in place and a pink blush tints Agatha's neck even though she looks annoyed at having spoken at all.</p><p>"I don't want to do the same things they did to you," Rio feels the need to explain, just to be sure Agatha understands why she's hesitant.</p><p>"I know," Agatha brushes her thumbs over the sides of Rio's face.</p><p>"But I didn't want it from them. They used their scent and my body against me and I fought the entire time," Agatha's voice carries a fragility that makes Rio wince with sympathy.</p><p>"I don't want to fight you," Agatha shakes Rio's head lightly to drive her point home as if doing so will help the pieces fall into place for the alpha.</p><p>"I don't want you to fight yourself either."</p><p>Rio's expression grows pained because the offer is tempting but she needs to be sure Agatha is okay above all else.</p><p>"I don't want to hurt you, even by accident."</p><p>"What if I want you to?"</p><p>Agatha drops her hands and stares at Rio, her blue eyes shining and unwavering as Rio stares back, confused and concerned.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Rio narrows her eyes, her alpha tugging at her impulses, still reacting to Agatha's submissive scent.</p><p>Agatha plays with the sheet absently, organizing her thoughts before she speaks and Rio wonders about the ones that have Agatha's pupils dilating.</p><p>"I know you're holding back and I know why," Agatha shifts, bending her knee and resting her chin on it and clasping her hands over her shin, adopting a partially protective pose signifying how vulnerable she feels.</p><p>"But every other alpha has taken liberties and it feels wrong."</p><p>Rio growls quietly in agreement and goosebumps rise on Agatha's arms.</p><p>"I can feel them and I hate it."</p><p><em>"I can fix it," </em>echoes in Rio's head except this time it's flipped, Rio wants to fix this.</p><p>Her alpha tugs harder, returning to her thoughts of pinning Agatha down and taking her, except instead of begging for mercy she imagines Agatha screaming in ecstasy but Rio still wants a safeguard.</p><p>"Safeword," she taps Agatha's knee. "Just in case."</p><p>Agatha is about to argue but Rio gives her a stern look; it's not something she's willing to compromise on, needing to feel like there is a fail safe in place.</p><p>"I will be drier than the Sahara if you make me say 'pineapple'," Agatha deadpans and Rio chuckles.</p><p>"How about red light?" Rio suggests and Agatha makes a face.</p><p>"Just 'red'," she shoots back and Rio thinks about it for a moment and nods.</p><p>Agatha doubts she'll be using it but Rio looks more at ease so she doesn't mind at least having it there for her to use. She nudges Rio's leg with her big toe and the alpha looks down and back up with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha fights the urge to pout and reaches for Rio, sliding her hand high on the alpha's thigh suggestively.</p><p>"Yes?" Rio's eyes flash for a second and this time Agatha does pout, dragging her palm over the front of Rio's briefs and intensifying her pheromones.</p><p>Rio's warm brown eyes darken and her pupils dilate, her own dominance responding and making Agatha duck her head in deference though she keeps her hand in place.</p><p>"Did you want something?" Rio continues to tease and Agatha glares, frustrated at being stonewalled, but Rio wants to hear Agatha ask for it.</p><p>"You," Agatha replies quickly but Rio isn't going to let it go.</p><p>"I'm right here."</p><p>Agatha grumbles low in her throat and though Rio can smell her irritation, her arousal increases with it until Rio can almost taste it in the air.</p><p>"Why are you being stubborn?" Agatha complains as Rio snatches her hand away by the wrist and pulls her forward, forcing Agatha to uncurl her legs and lay half-sprawled in front of the alpha.</p><p>"Why are <em>you </em>being so stubborn?" Rio parrots, grinning as she climbs atop the omega, slipping her leg between Agatha's and holding her wrist hostage next to her head.</p><p>Rio drops her lips to Agatha's collarbone and rocks her thigh against the omega as her free hand slips under Agatha's sleep shirt to grasp and squeeze at soft skin.</p><p>Suddenly inundated with sensation, Agatha's eyes flutter closed and she tilts her head back in a quiet gasp, her free hand clutching at Rio's side and hip.</p><p>"Tell me what you want," Rio hums, sucking a mark onto the pale skin at Agatha's sternum as her fingers find a hardened nipple and pinch roughly, tugging when Agatha groans and rocks her hips, seeking more pressure that Rio is happy to provide.</p><p>There's an underlying tone of command in Rio's voice that Agatha wants to push back against if only to drive Rio further into her dominant state but when Rio gathers her shirt and lifts it to expose her breasts to her greedy mouth, Agatha doesn't have it in her to resist.</p><p>Rio's warm tongue circles a nipple and draws it into her mouth, biting and soothing and holding Agatha down as her chest arches and small cries of pleasure leave her lips.</p><p>"Fuck me," Agatha pants, squeezing her legs around Rio's thigh.</p><p>The alpha can feel how warm Agatha is as her slick starts to soak through her underwear and shorts, grinding shamelessly against firm muscle in a futile search for relief.</p><p>"Fuck you how?" Rio sinks her teeth into the top of Agatha's breast and the omega cries out in equal parts pain and pleasure that has Agatha's scent gland burning, aching for the same kind of pressure.</p><p>"Hard," Agatha whines, writhing beneath the alpha.</p><p>Rio sits up, letting Agatha go and sliding backwards off the edge of the bed, standing to shed her briefs and her bra as Agatha pulls off her shirt before Rio hooks her arms around Agatha's legs, pulling her to the edge of the bed.</p><p>Rio tugs at Agatha's shorts, pulling both underwear and shorts off as Agatha lifts her legs to help. The alpha smooths her hands over Agatha's calves and parts her legs, squeezing her thighs and kneeling, unable to resist the urge to put her mouth on the omega's glistening cunt.</p><p>"Oh my god," Agatha moans, curling her fingers in the sheets as Rio's tongue spears her cunt and her hands push Agatha's thighs apart, holding her open and pushing her knees against her chest.</p><p>Rio rips her mouth away and places open mouth kisses along the inside of Agatha's thigh until she chooses a spot, soft and delicate, and sinks her teeth into skin hard enough to bruise, marking the omega like a temporary tattoo and satisfying some of her alpha's desires.</p><p>Agatha cries out and tries to twist her body away as Rio soothes the bite with her tongue, tracing the indents left by her canines, sucking lightly to ensure the blood rushes to the surface of her skin.</p><p>Rio is still hesitant so she only allows herself to indulge a little bit at a time, watching Agatha's reactions carefully as she pants during the brief reprieve.</p><p>Rio stands and takes herself in hand, stroking her cock a few times before holding the base and dragging the length against Agatha's flushed cunt a few times, pushing the head against her entrance until the alpha breeches the walls of her cunt.</p><p>Agatha gasps and Rio pushes forward to fill her all at once, groaning as the warm walls envelope her cock and she buries herself to the hilt, her alpha finally tasting a fraction of satisfaction as she takes what the omega offers.</p><p>Agatha's mouth drops open and she claws at the edge of the bed when Rio starts a steady rhythm, her slim hips crashing against the inside of Agatha's thighs, jarring her body with each thrust.</p><p>"Oh, fuck, yes!" Agatha pants, reaching for Rio as the alpha leans over her, holding tightly as her body rocks in time with Rio's thrusts.</p><p>She feels so full, Rio hitting something that she can feel in her stomach and still if she could take Rio deeper she would, wanting to feel the alpha filling her womb as her omega slips into place, begging to be bred.</p><p>Rio's alpha can sense the change and she swells almost painfully. Her hand travels aimlessly until Agatha drags it up to her neck, her half-lidded eyes sparkling as she brushes her nose against Rio's.</p><p>"Please," she whispers and Rio's alpha jumps at the chance, tightening her grip until Agatha's eyes fall shut again and she can feel the strain in the tendons beneath the pale skin of her neck.</p><p>The muscles in Rio's legs and stomach ache as she moves faster, driving Agatha mad with the wet friction as her body stiffens, growing taut as pleasure coils low in her belly.</p><p>Rio shifts the hand around Agatha's neck, positioning her thumb over the scent gland that yearns for some kind of attention. Agatha practically mewls and turns her head, stretching her neck for Rio to take.</p><p>Rio can feel the sharp edge of her fangs cutting into her lip and keeps her thumb in place, blocking herself from biting down where she really wants to. Instead, Rio presses down and Agatha nearly shrieks, cunt tightening around her cock as Rio drops her head in an indulgent groan.</p><p>Rio rolls her hips and slows momentarily, massaging her thumb over the gland at Agatha's neck as the omega whimpers and squirms, grinding against Rio desperately as her need clouds her logical mind, focusing only on the sparks and shocks that shoot through her body, making sounds she would consider obscene if she were in her right mind.</p><p>"Alpha, please," Agatha begs raggedly, her throat raw as Rio groans through clenched teeth, the hair rising on the back of her neck as tingles travel down her spine.</p><p>She picks up her aggressive pace, matching the cadence of her heartbeat, the sound of skin upon skin joining the chorus of their cries, ignoring the hair falling in her face as their bodies slide against each other; Agatha digs her nails into Rio's back, leaving crescent shaped marks and angry red lines that will sting later but at the moment only feeds into the sensations and urges swirling in Rio's head.</p><p>Rio wants her.</p><p>She loves her.</p><p>Agatha is <em>hers.</em></p><p>With those three thoughts spinning through her mind, the urge to bite is overwhelming so Rio sinks her teeth off center into Agatha's shoulder as she presses down hard against the gland under her thumb and all at once, Agatha spasms and screams, tightening and holding Rio in place as she comes, lifting her hips from the bed and bucking as the blood rushes in her ears and the air in her lungs is stolen.</p><p>Rio can feel the sweat dripping down the back of her neck and collecting near her collarbones as her cock starts to swell and when Agatha's cunt tightens, drawing Rio's cock in further, the swelling doesn't stop, her knot forming at the base, threatening to lock them together if Rio doesn't pull out.</p><p>Agatha gasps, feeling her cunt stretch further as her omega wails happily, growing slicker and inviting the alpha to knot her on instinct, clawing at Rio's thighs as the alpha stands up again, hovering between pulling Rio closer and pushing her away.</p><p>It's almost too late when Rio pulls herself out with steady force, already partially swollen and stretching Agatha until the widest part passes and she slips out all at once.</p><p>Agatha nearly sobs with the emptiness.</p><p>"No! Alpha, please," Agatha whines, a shattered groan echoing in her chest when Rio re-enters her shallowly.</p><p>Agatha isn't full as she wants but it's better than being left bereft and she'll happily take whatever pleasure her alpha gives, reduced to a whimpering and incoherent shaking mess.</p><p>A few more rapid thrusts and Rio is coming on the inside of Agatha's thighs and Agatha bites her lip to stifle her complaint, wanting the alpha to spill inside her cunt, driven by a deep instinctual desire.</p><p>Rio gasps for air as her cock twitches, spilling cum against Agatha's slick skin in thin ropes, dropping forward to brace her hands on either side of Agatha's body when her climax steadily winds down and she tries to catch her breath and blink away the white bursting lights behind her eyelids.</p><p>"Fuck," Rio breathes, her arms shaking as she holds herself up.</p><p>Agatha pulls Rio down, wanting to feel the alpha's weight on top of her, kissing her messily in a mix of teeth and tongue, pressing her forehead against Rio's as they breathe in tandem.</p><p>"Did you almost-"</p><p>"Sorry," Rio replies, slurring her words as she struggles with coherence and trying to will her knot away.</p><p>"Didn't know if you'd be okay with..." Rio trails off, trusting Agatha will understand.</p><p>Agatha nods and holds Rio's face in her hands. There are dangerous words dangling at the tip of her tongue, threatening to break her heart apart to bleed all over the alpha. She's never felt so cared for, so</p><p><em>Loved</em>.</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, trying to expand her rib cage to make space for the sudden influx of emotions as the alpha takes a place somewhere next to her heart and under her lungs, stealing her breath.</p><p>She tilts her head and kisses Rio slowly, caressing her lips with hers in tender reverence.</p><p>"I want <em>all </em>of you," Agatha murmurs, echoing Rio's past words.</p><p>A slow dopey smile stretches across Rio's lips.</p><p>"Green."</p><p>"What?" Agatha asks.</p><p>"Opposite red," Rio hums, lowering her head to brush her lips against the bruise forming on Agatha's shoulder.</p><p>A shiver runs down Agatha's spine and her cunt twitches.</p><p>"You're so stupid," Agatha scoffs, rocking her hips against Rio's, feeling the alpha's moan reverberate through her body.</p><p><em>Stupidly in love, </em>Rio thinks, nuzzling Agatha's neck.</p><p>"And you're still here," Rio teases instead and Agatha smiles and hides her reply in a kiss.</p><p>
<em>There's nowhere I'd rather be.</em>

<p>Rio is much more affectionate over the next few days.</p><p>Agatha doesn't mind though she acts like she does, swatting at Rio's hands when they wander when she's busy cooking, showering, responding to emails from her divorce attorney, or watching her reality shows.</p><p>Sometimes Agatha will let Rio succeed in seducing her, occassionally finding herself over the arm of the couch as the television plays in the background or making a frozen pizza when Rio gets impatient and Agatha is on her knees, too preoccupied to notice dinner is burning.</p><p>Being in their bubble shields Agatha from the worst effects of nightmares or random bouts of sadness that sneak up on the omega, mourning for her past self that she feels so divorced from it's like looking at a completely different person.</p><p>It helps when Agatha needs to correspond with her ex-in laws, communicating thankfully through the family lawyer since Agatha can't imagine a scenario in which Ralph's family would be cordial with her and nor does she want it; hoping never to speak to them again once Ralph's material things are parsed or sold.</p><p>It reminds Agatha that he had been a person and she hates it; wishing he could be a one-dimensional villain that she can hate indiscriminately, but the reminder that he had parents and family, people who cared for him...</p><p>Agatha hates that she cares.</p><p>She is finally able to call Jen, giving her a long overdue update, skimming over the meetings as much as she can to focus on the possible treatments for her condition.</p><p>Jen sounds relieved in the end though she does initially cuss Agatha out for almost dying which Agatha sits through dutifully, knowing it comes from a place of care and tells her about Paul's arrest since that's now public record.</p><p>Paul is arraigned for murder, trafficking, extortion, and assault among other charges and soon after, one of the hired guns that tried to run Rio and Agatha off the road starts talking to take a plea deal that would lessen his sentence and get him transferred to a different prison- away from Paul.</p><p>The request reminds Agatha that they still don't know the extent of Paul's reach or the nature of his connections, unsure if the suspect talking is a victory if he's so eager to put distance between himself and Paul.</p><p>Either way, they learn that Ralph directed him toward Agatha, saying he had been referred by a previous contact. He also confirms that Brenda Moore had been pushed instead of the initial speculation of her jumping off the overpass.</p><p>As far as Agatha knows, Brenda is still in a coma in the hospital.</p><p>Though there are many updates happening daily, the one place that has been silent is Dr. Banner's team at the lab.</p><p>Agatha refuses to let Rio check for updates on her behalf, not wanting to piss off the team and trusting they'll let them know when something is found.</p><p>That email comes a week later.</p><p>Dr. Banner asks Agatha to come in for more scans and to discuss her options going forward.</p><p>Agatha notices Rio's anxiousness when she tells her, though the alpha tries to downplay how much she's worried. Agatha can't blame her, she's just as nervous and there are so many things Dr. Banner can tell her that it feels overwhelming to prepare for every possibility.</p><p>So instead, Agatha schedules the first available appointment, facing the unknown head on and caging her anxiety temporarily while pouring her attention into her relationship with Rio.</p><p>It's an odd feeling putting a name on what they're doing together; of course it's been a relationship the entire time but to actually call it that or acknowledge it, even in her head, feels substantial to Agatha.</p><p>She doesn't know what to refer to Rio as either, except just...Rio.</p><p>Are they girlfriends? Agatha cringes, feeling juvenile, but it's the closest thing Agatha can find to describe her attachment to the alpha.</p><p>Rio isn't <em>her</em> alpha; at least not in any traditional sense but 'girlfriend' isn't deep enough to encompass the depth of her feelings or the way she feels destined to be entwined with Rio.</p><p>Or how much she loves her.</p><p>If Agatha thinks about it too hard tears well in her eyes.</p><p>She's partially in awe; surprised that she has the capacity to feel so much after being so emotionally stunted for most of her life and the rest of her idles on disbelief.</p><p>Sometimes, if Rio falls asleep first, Agatha will stare at the alpha like she's going to disappear. Before, Agatha had wondered what karmic debt she could owe for all the terrible things in her life but she stares at Rio and wonders if she's too good to be true.</p><p>Agatha might have endured terrible things but she certainly hasn't been good enough to deserve this.</p><p>Still, the needy and selfish part of her hoards every bit of affection, drinking it all down like a parched man in an oasis, like she may not get another chance.</p><p>Agatha had told Rio she wanted to spend whatever time she has left with her and a small, innocent voice speaks up in her head:</p><p>
<em>What if it's forever?</em>
</p><p>She holds the question close to her heart; Agatha's best kept secret and the one that brings her the most shame, coloring her cheeks with <em>need</em> that feels like ripping her chest apart to offer a paltry sacrifice; a beating, bloody, and broken heart.</p><p>Because to <em>need </em>Rio, to put herself in a position so vulnerable, is no different and the thought of being found wanting sends Agatha's stomach into free fall, unable to fathom recovering should Rio decide to toss her aside.</p><p>Agatha isn't sure how to measure the worthiness of a partner; her track record is trash and she knows love can fade, leaving resentment in it's wake.</p><p>If worthiness is measured in time invested they surely don't qualify; barely acquainted for half a year and together for much shorter.</p><p>If measured in acts of service, Rio knocks it out of the park; from helping her escape Ralph to her dedication to keeping Agatha safe, Rio is more than worthy. But it then points out the imbalance; Agatha hasn't done nearly enough to be considered worthy of Rio and the idea of keeping score is one she would like to leave behind with Ralph.</p><p>Agatha ponders long and hard at night while Rio snores lightly, watching the alpha's face and hands twitch while she dreams and it's one night, when Rio's dreams seem to turn that Agatha has an epiphany.</p><p>The alpha had started with whimpering and Agatha watches as Rio's lips turn down, frowning as her brow furrows. Rio's fingers twitch again, curling inward and grasping and her scent shifts enough for Agatha to notice.</p><p>Agatha blankets Rio with her scent and smooths her thumb over Rio's brow until it unwrinkles and the alpha sighs deeply in her sleep, gravitating toward Agatha, resting peacefully once again.</p><p>She's proud of herself for doing something right and it occurs to Agatha that maybe it isn't about worthiness but acceptance.</p><p>Rio sees her as she is and smiles.</p><p>Agatha looks back and feels like she's home.</p><p>However, with her health issues and the case, Agatha can't seem to find a good time to actually talk to Rio about any of the big feelings taking up space in her chest.</p><p>It certainly has nothing to do with her fear of rejection and avoidance of emotional intimacy.</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>With that thought in mind, Agatha goes to her appointment, narrowing her focus to her health for the time being, pushing off the rest for later.</p><p><em>Later, </em>Agatha huffs.</p><p>How lucky she is to have a 'later'.</p><p>Rio stays for the scans and heads to the lobby to wait for the omega while Agatha sits in the familiar office.</p><p>Looking around, nothing has really changed; not that Agatha expected it to, she knows it's her that's changed so drastically that she feels like she's viewing the office through new eyes.</p><p>Her posture is much more relaxed than the last time, legs crossed at the knee and leaning back into the deep seated chair, elbow resting on the arm rest, and her eyes are sharper, more decisive than fearful.</p><p>Let's face it, she watched her ex-mate die and had a firearm pointed at her twice.</p><p>Somehow it puts things into perspective.</p><p>Dr. Banner walks through the door, closing it behind him and carrying his usual tablet and genial smile on his face.</p><p>Agatha nods in acknowledgement, noting the doctor looks good in green and her thoughts draw her back to Rio again in milliseconds, and Agatha lifts her thumbnail to her lips to hide the urge to smile like a lunatic.</p><p>"Hello, Agatha," Banner greets, settling into the chair opposite her.</p><p>"Doctor," Agatha replies, eyeing the dark tablet.</p><p>Instead of reaching for it and starting with her scan results, Banner leans forward with his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands in front of him.</p><p>"I've been keeping up with the case and before we get in to the technical parts, I wanted to check in with you."</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"You've been through a lot in a short time as a civilian," he explains. "We're here to talk about your health and that includes your overall well-being."</p><p>Banner lifts his glasses to rest in his curly hair.</p><p>"Is there anything you want to talk about? It doesn't have to be about what happened," Banner adds quickly. "But I did want to check."</p><p>Banner's voice is warm and inviting and Agatha sighs, her defenses aren't at full alert, deciding to take the opportunity to discuss what happened without worrying what the other person thinks. But she can't continue without saying her piece.</p><p>"Can I be honest?" Agatha asks and Banner chuckles softly.</p><p>"I would prefer it."</p><p>"I'm having a hard time trusting you because it feels like you have a stake in the case."</p><p>Agatha watches his reaction carefully and though he does look a little stung, he recovers quickly.</p><p>"Could you explain more?" He asks kindly.</p><p>"I'm a key witness right? All your work would be for nothing if I'm not fit to testify," Agatha's eyes flash, keeping her gaze steady in obvious challenge to prove her wrong.</p><p>To his credit, Banner doesn't cower but instead nods in understanding and his smile grows.</p><p>"Thank you, for being honest," he ducks his head to think.</p><p>"I do hope you're able to testify. My job is, in a sense, to do as you say and be sure you're able to," Banner steeples his fingers. "But as a doctor first, my duty is to do no harm."</p><p>"You would rather lose the case?" Agatha challenges.</p><p>Banner taps his fingers against his lips in thought, "I would prefer not to."</p><p>Agatha tenses.</p><p>"I enjoy my job," Banner confesses. "It's a powerful position, especially for an omega, which you know. But."</p><p>He pauses, "I became a doctor to help other omegas and I take my oath seriously."</p><p>His words are heavy with a purpose that Agatha can respect and she relaxes a bit.</p><p>"How many alphas did you piss off along the way?" A smirk tugs at her lips and Banner chuckles.</p><p>"A good amount," he says vaguely. "There were a few complaints when I stepped into this role."</p><p>Agatha huffs, "And which alpha fought on your behalf?"</p><p>"The Director," he answers knowingly. .</p><p>"Do you think we'll ever be able to do anything without an alpha's permission?" Agatha asks quietly, silently extending a connection to the man sitting across her.</p><p>"One day," Banner answers optimistically, "You don't?"</p><p>Agatha thinks about Rio and wonders if there are other alphas like her.</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe."</p><p>"Well right now, it seems you have total control over your decisions, no?" Banner asks curiously.</p><p>"I suppose," Agatha concedes. "You know what happened at the beach house arrest?"</p><p>Banner nods.</p><p>"It was too easy for him to manipulate me without a mate," Agatha exhales shakily, fingers fidgeting on the arm rest.</p><p>"Yes, but he did so by assault," Banner points out and Agatha grimaces.</p><p>"I know," Agatha grinds out, "It doesn't change the fact that it was easy."</p><p>Banner nods sadly, conceding her point, "And so where does that lead you?"</p><p>Agatha is quiet for a while, staring out the office window, silently trying to push back against the mental block that keeps her from admitting her fear.</p><p>"Is it so wrong to want to be claimed?" Agatha grinds out, tears stinging her waterline.</p><p>Banner looks at her curiously and Agatha darts her eyes away, not able to handle any judgement that might linger in the doctor's gaze.</p><p>"What makes you say that it's wrong?"</p><p>Agatha pulls herself together and blinks rapidly to disperse her tears.</p><p>"Being claimed is a sacrifice," she explains. "It felt like giving up a part of myself and becoming an off shoot of someone else."</p><p>Agatha grinds her teeth together.</p><p>"But I still want it."</p><p>"I don't think that's wrong," Banner replies quietly. "It's a part of our biology but it's also natural to want connection."</p><p>"Even at your own detriment?" Agatha asks incredulously.</p><p>Banner pauses, "Your previous experience being claimed doesn't have to carry over to your next experience."</p><p>"My next experience?" Agatha asks, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.</p><p>Banner ducks his head and Agatha is surprised to see a blush coloring his cheeks.</p><p>"Can I be honest?" He asks her, parroting her words from earlier.</p><p>"I think you're legally required to be," Agatha shoots back and Banner smiles.</p><p>"You, uh," He stutters and Agatha raises both eyebrows, now worried about what he has to say.</p><p>"You've been scented," he clears his throat. "Quite strongly."</p><p>It's Agatha's turn to blush, her chest and face heating up with embarrassment as she ducks her gaze.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Apparently being in their bubble has some drawbacks, Agatha muses, but her embarrassment mostly comes from someone else pointing it out rather than her connection to Rio.</p><p>With just the two of them most of the time, Agatha has probably gone noseblind to Rio since she's so used to smelling her all the time.</p><p>Banner smiles kindly, though it comes off a bit awkward and Agatha shifts in her seat. It does feel nice to have something of Rio with her.</p><p>"Is she going to face any trouble?" Agatha asks in concern.</p><p>Banner shakes his head, "There are certain...allowances made for agents in field work."</p><p>Before she can ask Banner perks up and reaches for his tablet, waking the dark screen and pulling up a scan for her to see, "This actually might be a good time to talk about your scan results."</p><p>"Why?" Agatha asks, confused when she can't find the connection, watching Banner stand and walk over to the chair next to her, nodding his chin at it.</p><p>"May I?"</p><p>Agatha nods and he takes a seat and turns the tablet to her, showing her a brain scan with obvious decay and reduced activity. She panics for a moment, wondering how it's possible she's still conscious but Banner interrupts her thoughts.</p><p>"Despite you being the only person able to testify, you are not the only living survivor of the tests," he explains bringing up another scan with obvious differences.</p><p>"Ms. Moore's scans show similar degradation in the same area of the brain suggesting she will experience the same memory loss eventually."</p><p>Agatha bites back her responses, waiting for the doctor to continue.</p><p>"However, despite both of you stopping the supplement and divorcing your husbands around the same time, Ms. Moore's scans show significant decline where your scans," Banner points to another scan, much more colorful and filled out.</p><p>"Have stabilized."</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, a turbulent mix of fear and hope fighting for dominance as she tries to make sense of what Dr. Banner is telling her.</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>"I had the same question," Banner nods in sympathy.</p><p>"When we got the first vial from you we ran an analysis and compared it to what we already knew," Banner swipes his finger on the screen to a chart with notes and a small diagram.</p><p>"It isn't as advanced as the 'z-drug' as the media is calling it. Seems like this serum is still in the early stages of development. But within it, we found during simulation and limited testing that the drug and this serum attaches to the receptors in our brains that are activated by the same neurotransmitters as a mated individual."</p><p>"So being mated..." Agatha replies slowly, understanding dawning on her.</p><p>Banner nods, confirming her train of thought, "Being mated keeps you stable. The moment you and Ms. Moore lost your connections to your mates, it kick started a domino effect that lead to your headaches and eventual black outs."</p><p>"Like a self-destruct," Agatha murmurs as Banner nods.</p><p>"We don't know if that was purposefully built in to the compound or if it's simply a useful side effect."</p><p>"Useful?" Agatha scrunches her face in disgust.</p><p>Banner ducks his head in understanding and explains, "If any omega were to escape the trafficking ring, they'll be incapacitated in a few months time. No way to trace them back to the perpetrators."</p><p>Agatha shudders and wonders how many omegas have already met such a fate.</p><p>"So what does that mean for my scans?"</p><p>"When is the last time you had an episode?" He answers her question with a question.</p><p>Agatha has to think and realizes it's been a while, not since she'd given herself permission to be with Rio, thinking they were on borrowed time.</p><p>"Weeks," she admits and Banner nods excitedly like he's confirmed the last piece of a puzzle.</p><p>"I think your body has subconsciously accepted another mate," he explains delicately, zooming in on a part of her brain that is lit brightly.</p><p>"Your receptors are active."</p><p>"So I need to be mated to fix this?"</p><p>"Yes and no," Banner puts the tablet back to sleep and places it on the table.</p><p>"Our simulation testing projects that if you are mated, there's a good chance you'll stabilize. You won't lose your memory but you may also never recover what you lost," he explains.</p><p>"And what about the medicine? Is it useable?" Agatha questions.</p><p>"It is," Banner pauses and Agatha holds her breath, sensing a caveat.</p><p>"The serum seems to have the ability to restore some of the damage done to your limbic system and there's a higher chance you'll recover most of your memories. However," Banner takes a breath.</p><p>"Since the neurotransmitters use the same receptors as a mating bond, it's unlikely you'll be able to be truly mated again."</p><p>Agatha sits and absorbs what she's being told; Banner giving her a moment to do so.</p><p>"Truly mated how?" Agatha needs clarification.</p><p>"You can have a mark and legally you can still be recognized as mated but biologically, the bond most likely won't be there. You'll be effectively mated to the serum."</p><p><em>An artifical mate</em>, Agatha muses, her eyes darting back and forth.</p><p>The dark parts of her mind, the bits that Paul seemed to find kindred, go to thoughts of turning the drugs around and reverse manufacturing the serum in an omega's favor.</p><p>"Would it be the same as being mated? Would other alphas be able to influence me?"</p><p>There's a bit of hope in her voice that she feels a bit guilty about but hopefully Banner, as an omega, understands.</p><p>He seems to follow her train of thought and weighs something in his head.</p><p>"It's very possible alphas would not be able to easily, no," he settles on, eyeing Agatha's expression.</p><p>Agatha briefly imagines a reality of omegas artificially mated to avoid forced matings or omegas who choose not to be mated at all.</p><p>Would it be possible to manufacture an artificial resistance to alpha influence as well?</p><p>Agatha gets a glimpse of why Paul wanted her to work with him. She imagines the power and money that would come from not only releasing a cure but also targeting a whole new market, half the population, knowing other omegas would jump on the opportunity to also be free of unwilling alpha influence.</p><p>
<em>Create a crisis and offer a solution. </em>
</p><p>"I think," Agatha starts and stops and shakes off her inner thoughts, catching Banner's eyes briefly.</p><p>"I think I need to think about it," Agatha exhales, furrowing her brow as her brain goes into overdrive as she tries to process both the emotional and practical at the same time and a question rises to the forefront.</p><p>
<em>What does she tell Rio?</em>
</p><p>Panic joins the cacophony of emotions going off in her mind and her omega urges her to find Rio to help fix it while Agatha wants to take a moment away to think, knowing the alpha will be curious and suspicious if Agatha discloses nothing about her appointment.</p><p>How does she explain to Rio the temptation of absolute freedom?</p><p>Agatha loves Rio, surely that won't change if she chooses freedom. Her ability to love and be loved wouldn't change; her pull toward Rio even while mated to Ralph is proof, but she knows in her gut Rio wouldn't be happy.</p><p>The alpha would respect Agatha's choice, she's positive of that, but whether or not Rio would be able to stay with her... Agatha is unsure.</p><p>It should be an easy choice, Agatha should be running toward Rio, toward love and relationship, but she can't help but give thought to the 'what if' and the fear that whispers from the dark places in her mind.</p><p>Maybe that's what her mother meant when she said Agatha was wrong.</p><p>She always rejects what is supposed to be natural.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>The omega is brought back to her present surroundings and she catches Banner's look of concern.</p><p>"You can absolutely think about it," he says quietly and takes a moment.</p><p>"You seem unsettled," he points out and Agatha sits up straighter and shifts to try and collect herself and smooth over her composure.</p><p>She is starting to trust Dr. Banner but Agatha is nowhere near letting herself break in front of him.</p><p>"It's a lot," she says vaguely, pushing her hair back over her shoulders.</p><p>"It is," Banner concedes. "Talking it over with someone might help," he suggests.</p><p>"Isn't that what we're doing?" Agatha's bark doesn't affect Banner but it doesn't matter, there is no real venom to her voice.</p><p>Banner nods, "You can talk to me but maybe also talk to her, too."</p><p>It's the first time Banner directly addresses Agatha's relationship to Rio and her pulse jumps, still not used to the feeling of 'doing nothing wrong'; that Banner has no authority over her to make her feel chastised and thus, she has nothing to hide.</p><p>It takes her a moment, but Agatha begins to unfurl like a blooming flower testing the sun.</p><p>"And say what?" Agatha murmurs, "How do you explain to an alpha the temptation of total autonomy when they take it for granted?"</p><p>Banner smiles and Agatha thinks it looks a bit sad as his cheeks lift but his eyes don't; he seems to understand.</p><p>"Do you think she takes it for granted?" Banner asks and Agatha shrugs.</p><p>"No, I don't think so..."</p><p>"You'll never know until you try," Banner urges and Agatha shoots him an unimpressed look.</p><p>"<em>What if I fall? My dear, what if you fly," </em>Agatha quips sarcastically, not satisfied with recycled words of encouragement.</p><p>Banner smirks in genuine amusement, "Okay, so you fall. What happens then?"</p><p>Agatha chews on her bottom lip and a wave of anxiety washes over her.</p><p>"She leaves."</p><p>Banner nods sympathetically.</p><p>"It's possible she might, you can't really control that."</p><p>"What happened to 'do no harm'?" Agatha quips and Banner chuckles in spite of himself.</p><p>"I think if you care about her leaving enough to worry about it, then it might be worth trying to explain before you make a decision."</p><p>Agatha huffs; the truth of what Banner says resonates and an internal struggle commences between standing and facing something that feels larger than herself and running away.</p><p>
<em>It's only a profile if it's a pattern.</em>
</p><p>Agatha needs to break the pattern; something she's only done in the past with Rio's help. For the most part, they've faced outside ordeals that pushed them closer and solidified their connection but for this, Agatha feels like she's turning inward, placing her opposite the alpha in conflict.</p><p>"How long do I have to decide?" She asks.</p><p>"Sooner is better but if you need a timeframe...should I check back in a week?" Banner offers and Agatha nods; having a deadline might help force her to do what she needs to do.</p><p>Banner checks the clock briefly and returns his attention to Agatha.</p><p>"We're out of time but if you need to talk, I'm an email away," Banner assures and picks up his tablet as Agatha stands and he walks her to the office door.</p><p>Agatha pauses for a moment at the threshold, steeling herself to see Rio.</p><p>Banner seems to notice and offers a sympathetic smile, "You deserve to be happy," he reminds her, "Whatever that looks like."</p><p>Agatha gives Banner a side glance, inhales, and steps through the door, making her way to the waiting area where she can see Rio talking casually with a colleague as she waits.</p><p>Agatha can almost see the hairs rising on Rio's arms and knows she's been noticed. Rio confirms it when her eyes dart over her colleague's shoulder, briefly making eye contact with Agatha before returning her attention to the conversation.</p><p>It's a second long interaction but Agatha knows that though Rio's eyes are not on her, the alpha is still watching, hyper aware of Agatha whenever she's near.</p><p>The conflict in her chest clashes like choppy waves on a beach, hitting the sand hard, earth and sea daring the other to give in first in an eternal battle of back and forth.</p><p>Agatha watches Rio wrap up her conversation and turn her amber-tinted gaze toward her as a shiver travels down her back and her omega basks in the attention.</p><p>"Hey, everything good?" Rio approaches and a warm blanket of forest-scented comfort washes over Agatha and she closes her eyes briefly, Rio's hopeful expression burning itself into the back of her eyelids.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha breathes and offers a tentative smile as Rio cocks an eyebrow, not entirely convinced though she accepts the answer for now, aware of the public setting.</p><p>"Ready to go?" Rio tilts her chin toward the elevators and Agatha nods, keeping her eyes focused on the walls around her in subconscious contemplation.</p><p>Rio tries her best to be as neutral as possible, treading delicately around the omega though she isn't sure what she's trying to avoid, just a feeling that there is something precariously balanced that Rio doesn’t want to disrupt.</p><p>The drive is silent and Rio gets no hints from Agatha's scent though the other woman looks deep in thought the entire time and Rio wonders if Agatha is consciously trying to control it though Rio is sure if the news was dire, Agatha wouldn't be able to control it so easily.</p><p>Rio can only assume the news is bittersweet in some way but she tries desperately to keep her mind from spiraling through possibilities, chastising herself for putting so much pressure and importance on the serum, worrying she subconsciously put pressure on Agatha in turn.</p><p>When they return to the safe house, Rio decides to wait for Agatha to offer up any information though her alpha whines plaintively, yearning for the other woman. She reminds herself to be patient and let Agatha come to her, remembering the early days of living with the omega.</p><p>"Dinner?" Rio asks, pulling out rice and chicken.</p><p>Agatha recognizes the ingredients and she softens a bit and nods, "Sure. You want any help?"</p><p>Rio relaxes a bit in turn, noting that Agatha isn't actively shutting her out which she takes as a good sign and shakes her head.</p><p>"Nah," Rio juts her chin toward the living area, "Pick something to watch."</p><p>The alpha falls back into their familiar routine finding comfort in it and hoping it might help Agatha open up a bit. She really wants to ask about Agatha's appointment and the curiosity is starting to get the better of her despite her attempt to give Agatha space.</p><p>When dinner is ready, Rio makes two bowls and hands Agatha's hers, a new season of a reality dating show featuring couples testing their bonds with other single men and women is queued up for them to watch.</p><p>Rio settles while Agatha presses play and the intro starts, filling the silence with preppy voice overs and pre-recorded sound bites.</p><p>Both women force themselves to focus on the show, steadfastly ignoring the tiny pebble of tension that rubs uncomfortably; not quite annoying enough to do anything about but still noticeable.</p><p>It's the kind of friction that both know will lead to an open wound if left unaddressed.</p><p>On screen, tension is skyrocketing between couples as singles make their interest known, exchanging little tokens to signify attraction while reactions range from tears to jealousy to unbothered confidence.</p><p>An omega tries to console his girlfriend when a third alpha shows interest, addressing her by every pet name except her actual name which makes Agatha frown, immediately disliking the omega.</p><p>"Ralph used to do that," she says quietly, breaking the silence between them as they finish their dinners, empty bowls sitting on the coffee table as Agatha curls her legs up on the couch.</p><p>"Whenever he was apologizing or if I got angry, he'd call me sweetheart, honey, baby, darling... it used to irritate the hell out of me."</p><p>Rio can't help but wonder what thoughts are running through Agatha's head or why she's bringing it up; the alpha's impatience wants to cut through Agatha's words and delve into the root of what she wants to know but Rio urges patience, taking the opening for conversation at face value for now.</p><p>"What did he call you when he wasn't apologizing?"</p><p>Agatha thinks for a bit, eyes still watching and absorbing the various twists and turns on screen.</p><p>"Sometimes a tease or 'vixen'," Agatha rolls her eyes. "Usually when he wanted sex."</p><p>Rio snorts unhappily but gets over it quickly.</p><p>"So not a fan of pet names then?" Rio side-eyes Agatha knowing they've both called one another certain things in bed, but who knows, maybe Agatha's the kind of person to keep it to the bedroom only.</p><p>"I didn't say that," Agatha murmurs, glancing at Rio briefly.</p><p>Rio tilts her head, trying to figure out what Agatha is really trying to say.</p><p>A sudden and silent epiphany hits Rio, returning her eyes to the screen. Agatha isn't good at expressing her emotions outright; fighting a mix of reluctance and loss of words. Maybe the omega has found a work around in her shows; using on screen conflict to try and frame her own emotions and express her thoughts in a way that feels safe for her.</p><p>Rio's heart speeds up with the excitement of discovery and instead of impatience, Rio finds her alpha more amenable to patience and following the conversation, letting Agatha lead.</p><p>She'll point it out to Agatha later, doubtful that the omega even knows she's doing it, but for now, Rio shifts her focus.</p><p>"Did you have any pet names for him?" Rio asks tentatively.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "Not anything I used on a consistent basis."</p><p>"My ex used to call me her 'little cactus' to annoy me," Rio offers and Agatha makes a face.</p><p>"I'm starting to understand why it didn't work," Agatha quips and Rio smiles.</p><p>"You're right, it wasn't the cheating, it was the nicknames," Rio shoots back and Agatha bites her lip and smirks, letting the conversation fall into a lull for a bit.</p><p>Not wanting to let her opening go, Rio poses her own question.</p><p>"So it doesn't bother you when I call you 'baby'?" Rio isn't sure why the question makes her blush but at least she's not alone as Agatha's cheeks become rosy.</p><p>"No," Agatha mumbles shyly.</p><p>Rio's grin grows slowly, turning a bit playful as she gently pokes at the omega.</p><p>"I'll make a list and try some out then," Rio teases as Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>"I will absolutely use sex as a weapon if any are especially egregious," Agatha threatens.</p><p>Rio feels some of the tension between them ease or, at the very least, Rio feels better now that Agatha seems to be opening up to her, bantering back and flirting in the way that makes Rio's chest warm.</p><p>The alpha reaches for the other woman, wrapping her arms around Agatha's waist and pulling her close, happy when the omega doesn't resist.</p><p>"What if I promise not to use them when I'm upset with you?"</p><p>Agatha tenses then scoffs, "Then I guess I'll just be Agatha to you from now on."</p><p>It's meant as a joke but there's a hint of resignation that concerns Rio, squeezing Agatha gently as if she might slip through her grasp like mist.</p><p>"What makes you say that?" Rio probes, murmuring quietly next to Agatha's ear.</p><p>"What would you have done if I didn't leave Ralph?" Agatha asks instead, blindsiding Rio with the topic change though she reminds herself to roll with it.</p><p>"Uh," Rio takes a minute to think. "I don't know. I think I would have been disappointed."</p><p>Rio sighs, "I would've tried to force myself to ignore you, forget your scent...tried not to show up at your office again like a stalker."</p><p>Rio can feel the way Agatha's breathing changes and she's close enough to see her swallow.</p><p>"Do you think you would have succeeded?"</p><p>She sounds nervous and Rio can't figure out why so she elects to answer honestly instead of guessing what Agatha wants her to say.</p><p>"Eventually, and with a lot of effort and therapy," Rio admits.</p><p>Agatha trembles and Rio turns her head, watching tears gather and fall from crystal blue eyes and Rio turns them both so they can face each other.</p><p>"What if I wanted you around? Even if I couldn't leave?" Agatha presents more stipulations and Rio studies the omega warily.</p><p>"Are you asking if we would have had an affair?" Rio furrows her brow and Agatha shrugs.</p><p>"I...don't know. Maybe," Rio tries to imagine being in that position knowing it would be a bad idea but if Agatha wanted her, she's not sure she'd be able to resist.</p><p>"But it would have to change at some point, either by you leaving him or me..."</p><p>
<em>Leaving you. </em>
</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to say that but Agatha already knows, her tears flowing freely now.</p><p>The alpha reaches for Agatha's hand, "Why are you asking?"</p><p>Agatha's expression morphs in anguish, "I have to tell you something..."</p><p>Agatha repeats Dr. Banner's words in fits and starts, withdrawing her hand from Rio's in anticipation when the alpha frowns, taking in Agatha's options and feeling her heart crack when Agatha explains the temptation of an artifical mating.</p><p>For a second, she's elated; Agatha could be hers. Her mate.</p><p>But as Agatha continues to explain the side effects of the serum and how appealing they sound...</p><p>All Rio hears is Agatha would be hers but not truly <em>hers.</em></p><p>She would never be.</p><p>Suddenly Agatha's questions all make sense and the omega seems poised for an explosive reaction but it doesn't come.</p><p>All she feels is disappointment.</p><p>And rejection.</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>Her voice breaks and maybe that's worse, Rio thinks as she watches Agatha's face crumble.</p><p>Rio doesn't reach for her; doesn't know how to react beyond what she feels in the moment. Her stomach drops and she leans back, putting some space between them as her own tears manifest.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curl into fists; angry at herself for hurting Rio and regretting the choice to bring it up as the dark unhealed parts of her whisper that she knew this would happen, it was only a matter of time.</p><p>She wants to blame Banner, cursing him for encouraging her to <em>talk </em>but Agatha grows even angrier knowing deep down this is <em>her </em>fault.</p><p>Rio can't focus with Agatha right in front of her as she wars with disappointment, grief, and anger, not sure how she should respond to all of it, only certain that it feels like she's been punched in the gut.</p><p>"I think I need a moment," Rio keeps her voice even and stands as Agatha nods, pressing her lips together tightly to keep from calling for the alpha.</p><p>Rio walks out of the room and heads for the bedroom and Agatha lets her go, sitting alone in the living room as the television continues to play.</p><p>But Agatha doesn't hear it above the one question circling the forefront of her mind.</p><p>
<em>Was it worth it?</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha cleans up the dishes, not knowing what else to do, going through the motions of washing and drying and putting things away, finding herself adrift afterward, stuck in a torturous limbo.</p><p>She knew Rio's reaction was a possibility when she took the risk of telling the alpha but expecting it and experiencing it are two different things, Agatha concludes as her heart clenches painfully.</p><p>Agatha returns to the couch and stares blankly at the television, picture blurring when her tears well and she blinks, spilling them down her cheeks to be wiped away with the back of her sleeve.</p><p>She's a coward looking to have her cake and eat it, trying to live as an alpha and love as an omega in a world where it simply isn't sustainable; sacrificing connection for freedom.</p><p>Being with Rio but not truly with her dooms the alpha to what is essentially an unrequited relationship; of course Rio would reject the idea, she's probably insulted Agatha would even ask.</p><p>As more time passes anger rises to meet her self-chastising, arguing back that Agatha was wrong, apparently Rio <em>does</em> take her freedom for granted; the alpha can't possibly understand what Agatha sacrificed to be mated.</p><p>She was a slave to Ralph's moods, her omega instinctually pulling her with him even if she didn't want it. The urge to go against her own comfort and wishes in favor of his felt like a leash around her neck; controlling and pulling and straining, and she never wants to feel that again.</p><p>Even now, her omega tugs at her, urging Agatha to fix this and restore the happy equilibrium between them, desiring the bliss of the past few days and already feeling the withdrawal that comes with Rio's absence.</p><p>Rio's hurt expression is flash burned into her vision and Agatha doesn't know what to do in response to Rio needing a moment; the alpha has never asked for one before, nor walked away from Agatha.</p><p>It frightens her.</p><p>Does needing a moment mean a few hours? Days? Does she want Agatha to chase after her or leave her alone? With Ralph, he wanted her to comfort him and chase after him but with Evanora, needing a moment meant to leave her alone on threat of punishment or outright abandonment.</p><p>If she chooses the wrong option, she'll make it worse and drive Rio further away.</p><p>So Agatha sits, paralyzed by indecision and internally spiraling, wondering if she's just destroyed the budding relationship and silently hoping Rio comes back.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio can't decide if she wants to pace or curl up on the bed.</p><p>What she really wants to do is go for a run or visit the range to throw her knives but she's confined to the house by assignment and despite how Rio feels, she's not going to leave Agatha unprotected.</p><p>In the end, Rio sits on the floor, legs stretched in front of her as she leans back against the bed.</p><p>She thinks about Agatha's hypothetical scenario. Ralph was nothing less than an abusive ass to Agatha during their marriage. If Agatha wanted her then...Rio can't imagine a scenario where she wouldn't be trying to get Agatha to leave him or make it safe for the omega to do so.</p><p>Maybe she would have given in to the temptation and fallen into an affair with Agatha but Rio is sure it would have been the most painful experience of her life; not just because Agatha wouldn't be hers but because Ralph didn't deserve her.</p><p>But the serum isn't abusive. It would be a completely neutral and silent third partner in their relationship.</p><p>Rio tries to conceptualize what that would be like, settling on the idea of a lavender marriage. If Agatha needed to mate with a friend for her safety but wanted to be with Rio still, would she do it?</p><p>If they were in a situation like that, maybe where same-sex relationships were still frowned upon then Rio would take whatever she could get but that situation implies there is a threat to Agatha's safety.</p><p>Ralph is dead.</p><p>Paul is in jail.</p><p>Rio is the only threat.</p><p>The alpha inhales sharply as the thought pierces her chest like a shard of glass; precise and sharp, and a fresh wave of sadness hits her with a force that knocks the wind out of her lungs.</p><p>Whether she realizes it or not, Agatha is afraid of Rio.</p><p><em>But I don't want to hurt her</em>, a small part of Rio whispers, arguing bitterly with the universe about fairness and fighting her old people-pleasing habits with the modicum of self-respect she's managed to build since starting therapy.</p><p>If it were five years earlier, Rio might have agreed without hesitation; doing anything to keep Agatha near despite what she might have felt to avoid rejection.</p><p>But now...Rio knows what she wants.</p><p>She might never be fully happy with half a relationship.</p><p>Rio pulls her legs up and holds her head in her hands, resting her elbows on her knees.</p><p>But the thought of leaving Agatha is quite literally painful; her body shudders with a wave of nausea as her fingers tingle with pins and needles. Rio's alpha has made its stance clear; prying away from Agatha will be akin to waging war with herself.</p><p>Rio tugs at her hair, squeezing her eyes shut in frustration.</p><p>She wants to call someone for an outside perspective but Rio hesitates; it's such an intimate problem that touches on personal feelings that talking to Alice or her mother feels like a violation of Agatha's privacy.</p><p>Whatever happens they need to work it out between themselves.</p><p>Another thought niggles in the back of Rio's mind, piggybacking on her fresh feelings of rejection and rising from depths Rio had tried to shove down and ignore.</p><p>
<em>"Can you imagine that? A sire rejecting his offspring..."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yelling echoes down the hallway.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"She probably wouldn't try to sell you to settle her debts like him..."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Urgency and fear, Rio's heart thrumming as she runs to the bedroom door and twists the knob.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I'll do it!" </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Like hell you will!"</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>Rio presses her palms against her temples to silence the voices of her past and present that only fuel her anger and poke at a primal instinct that demands she act before Agatha can, claiming the omega whether she wants it or not.</p><p>She digs her nails into her knees, the stinging pain a reprimand against those base instincts, snarling back at the alpha in her mind until the urge backs down and she relaxes her hands, tension leaving her body as she exhales with the effort.</p><p><em>This is what she's afraid of, </em>Rio's conscience whispers brokenly as the alpha takes a shuddering breath.</p><p>Rio reaches around for her phone before realizing she left it in the other room with Agatha.</p><p>She wants to email her therapist; maybe Rio can request an emergency session for the next day to try and make sense of the complicated layers of emotion that threaten to suffocate her, but she's not ready to face Agatha yet.</p><p>Looking around the room Rio spots Agatha's laptop, figuring she can log in to her personal email then log out.</p><p>When she opens the computer, Rio is greeted with two user profiles, one with Agatha's name and one with hers.</p><p>Immediately distracted from her task, Rio clicks on the icon and is brought to the desktop screen.</p><p>For a moment Rio wonders if there is something nefarious involved but Agatha's computer is encrypted and the omega has been using the laptop as recently as the previous night; Agatha would have said something if her computer had been tampered with.</p><p>Rio concludes that Agatha must have made the profile herself but why?</p><p>Aside from the standard pre-installed apps, a single mp4 file sits on the desktop named <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>Tense and emotionally strung out, Rio doesn't have the fortitude to resist the temptation to double click, opening a screen with a large play button and a freeze frame of Agatha at the beginning of the video.</p><p>Her alpha reacts to the image, howling in a mix of yearning and sadness, feeling the tug to return to the other woman's side deep in her gut.</p><p>The cursor hovers and Rio presses play.</p><p>Agatha sits on a plain bed and shifts in her seat, clearly awkward and uncomfortable, pulling her leg up toward her chest and looking off camera for a few beats.</p><p>The background, Rio recognizes, is the hospital room after Agatha had her longest black out and she spots the ear buds perched in the shell of Agatha's ear when she pushes her hair back over her shoulder.</p><p><em>"Hi</em>.<em>"</em></p><p>Agatha's on screen visage makes brief eye contact with the camera and she smiles so softly that Rio's stomach twists into knots. Agatha is beautiful, bathed in the light of a window, and there is an aura of vulnerability that radiates from her that Rio wants so badly to hold it makes the omega irresistible.</p><p>
<em>"I wasn't sure if I was gonna make one of these for you, everything is so new..."</em>
</p><p>Rio tries to estimate when the video was made but she can't quite tell. From Agatha's slight flush, however, Rio assumes this is after Agatha told her the truth about her plans for her future when her future had been uncertain.</p><p>
<em>"But what the hell, if you're watching this I'm probably gone, I won't be able to care."</em>
</p><p>Rio winces in time with Agatha on screen.</p><p>
<em>"And you at least deserve to know...you've done a lot for me, more than I can probably thank you for."</em>
</p><p>Her dark hair falls forward again and Rio's pulse flutters knowing how soft it feels between her fingers.</p><p><em>"I don't think..."</em> Agatha presses her lips together tightly, even alone it's difficult for her to express the feelings she's unaccustomed to, not quite trusting them, waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>Agatha takes a breath, chest rising and falling and Rio finally notices the omega is wearing Rio's Quantico shirt.</p><p>
<em>"I've been happy. All this shit and I'm the happiest I've ever been...it seems really stupid but I wanted to say that's because of you."</em>
</p><p>Agatha huffs, corner of her mouth lifting in a self-deprecating laugh.</p><p>
<em>"It figures I would find you when it's too late but I don't regret any of it."</em>
</p><p>Agatha bites her lip and blinks a few times, while her eyes grow glassy with tears.</p><p><em>"I'm sorry we didn't have more time." </em>The edge of Agatha's teeth rake over her bottom lip repetitively and Rio wants to reach out and soothe it with her thumb.</p><p><em>"I think I could have fallen in love you," </em>Agatha blinks and a few tears escape that she swipes away with her palm.</p><p>
<em>"I think I already have."</em>
</p><p>Rio practically slams the space bar, pausing the video because she wants to be able to hear the rest of it but her heart can't get past the overwhelming joy and relief that shatters her and feels like salvation at the same time, breaking her only to be put back together a different person.</p><p>Agatha loves her.</p><p>Her heart, her alpha, and her soul all cry out for Agatha in response, no longer trying to deny her feelings for the other woman, grieving harder because it isn't the inevitable that separates them now, but Agatha's decision might.</p><p>Rio sniffles and wipes at her eyes, stretching the neckline of her shirt, and blows a few breaths through her mouth and presses play to resume the rest of the video. There isn't much left.</p><p><em>"Sorry," </em>Agatha tilts her head sheepishly. <em>"I know it's the cowardly thing to do, to tell you through a video when you have no chance to respond but despite what you believe, I've never been brave."</em></p><p>Agatha fiddles with her toe and then the case for her ear buds.</p><p><em>"I hope you find someone who is," </em>she says sadly.</p><p>
<em>"You deserve everything you want. I hope you find it."</em>
</p><p><em>I already did, </em>Rio thinks mournfully.</p><p>Agatha rubs her lips together and inhales deeply, trying to keep her voice from shaking.</p><p>
<em>"Thank you for showing me what it feels like to be loved."</em>
</p><p>Agatha gives the camera one last look and leans forward to stop the recording and the video resets to the beginning with the play button over a freeze frame of Agatha.</p><p>Rio slumps in her seat, stunned as she tries to process the cacophony of emotions stirred up by Agatha's video, torn between running to the other woman and screaming in frustration.</p><p>They're in love with each other, it should be natural to fall into sync, to follow not just desire but what feels instinctual, the completion of a bond meant to tie them together intimately above all others.</p><p>
<em>I've never been brave.</em>
</p><p>Bullshit. Rio has seen Agatha be brave. She's been there for it.</p><p>Rio's mind and heart eventually slow down enough for her to think and organize her thoughts, forgetting her original task and sitting on the edge of the bed, hugging her knees to her chest.</p><p>Agatha runs; she avoids and hides but she's never been able to hide from Rio, not when the omega draws her focus simply by existing. Rio would do anything to stay by Agatha's side, she can't imagine hurting her in the way others have.</p><p>Why doesn't Agatha believe her?</p><p><em>Because she's scared, </em>Rio's conscience whispers, unable to hold on to her frustration.</p><p>Rio rests her head on her forearms as reason and sympathy take hold, dissolving her arguments and leaving room for guilt to settle.</p><p>Agatha has every right to be afraid.</p><p>Maybe not of Rio but of alphas in general.</p><p>Rio rubs her face against her arms and curses the universe, the world, the alphas who hurt Agatha, and society in general.</p><p>She doesnt want to control anyone, least of all Agatha.</p><p>
<em>"I know it's the cowardly thing to do, to tell you through a video when you have no chance to respond..."</em>
</p><p><em>But I can,</em> Rio thinks. She has a chance now to respond and now that Rio knows Agatha loves her, she decides to take her own advice and stop fighting what feels as natural as breathing.</p><p>Rio can't let Agatha decide without telling her exactly how she feels.</p><p>Her heartbeat picks up again, this time in anticipation as she builds her courage.</p><p>Whatever Agatha chooses, Rio will accept; she's too far in to leave Agatha now, but Rio needs to temper Agatha's trepidation; needs to be sure that Agatha understands what she feels, hopefully accepting it though Rio predicts it will be difficult.</p><p>For Agatha, accepting Rio means a large step away from everything Agatha is used to; not trusting what she doesn't know. She might even accept it better if Rio were harsher, more exacting, but she can't bring herself to do that and she so desperately wants to change the narrative of Agatha's internal monologue to something softer.</p><p>But in order to change, Agatha's old habits have to die and if Rio understands anything, it's how that darkness clings and screeches, using the last of it's strength in a final attempt to drag her back to the familiar.</p><p>It's not up to Rio to save Agatha, but she can give her something to reach for.</p><p>Rio wipes her face and inhales deeply, preparing to face the other woman again as she leaves the bedroom and walks the short distance to the living room only to find it empty.</p><p>The tv is still on and the blanket is there, creased and bunched but Agatha is no where to be found.</p><p>Rio panics and starts scanning the area, rushing to the kitchen and then the bathroom in quick succession, her stomach dropping when she finds nothing.</p><p>Finally she rushes to the small back porch area, opening the sliding door with too much force as Agatha startles and Rio sighs with relief.</p><p>Agatha sits on a cramped love seat, leaning forward and clutching the edge of the cushion, darting her eyes away from Rio when she realizes who it is.</p><p>"Sorry," Agatha mumbles. "I just needed air."</p><p>Agatha's pale skin glows in the low light and Rio can smell her on the slight breeze that chills her, goosebumps rising on her arms.</p><p>When Rio moves closer, Agatha shudders and Rio wonders if the omega is actually cold or if she's reacting to Rio's proximity.</p><p>"It's okay," Rio sits on a stool adjacent to the love seat. "I'm sorry you can't leave when you want to."</p><p>Rio assumes this is the closest thing to running away that's available to Agatha but the omega shakes her head sadly.</p><p>"I couldn't leave even if I wanted to," she confesses, implying just how attached she is to the alpha.</p><p>"Neither can I," Rio admits, earning her a surprised look from the other woman.</p><p>"I didn't know if you were coming back," Agatha replies.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio apologizes, "I didn't mean to scare you. I was overwhelmed. I should have told you I'd come back."</p><p>Agatha shrugs it off, lifting her shoulders toward her ears though relief runs through her body knowing Rio isn't planning on leaving.</p><p>Rio takes a breath; if she wants Agatha to be honest it's only fair Rio does the same.</p><p>"I get why the serum is appealing," Rio starts, "But all I could hear was you don't want me."</p><p>Rio holds her hand up to keep Agatha from interrupting when she opens her mouth in protest.</p><p>"I'm not saying that's what you said, it's just all I could feel in the moment," she clarifies and Agatha deflates, argument leaving her.</p><p>"It feels like..." Rio pauses, leg shaking where it rests on the rung of the stool, "Like you're afraid of me. Afraid I'll hurt you like they did."</p><p>"I'm not afraid of you," Agatha insists, eyes hardening in her stance. "You're nothing like them."</p><p>"Then why," Rio chokes, "I don't understand."</p><p>Agatha hesitates and Rio rushes to soften her words.</p><p>"I promise, I'll accept whatever you decide to do," Rio swallows around the tightness in her throat. "I can't leave you, it would literally tear me apart. I just want to understand," she pleads.</p><p><em>You want to know if you're a monster after all, </em>Rio's own darkness whispers to her from the pockets of insecurity that linger in her mind.</p><p>Agatha's heart clenches painfully and she quietly gasps for air, upset at the thought of making Rio feel like she wasn't wanted when in every possible future Agatha can imagine, Rio is there, serum or no. It was never a question of wanting Rio.</p><p>But she does see how choosing the serum could feel like a rejection...</p><p>Because it is.</p><p>It's a rejection of Rio's alpha.</p><p>And a quiet suggestion that Rio is no better than her designation.</p><p>Agatha's heart threatens to climb into her throat and she swallows hard.</p><p>"I'm scared of losing myself again," she whispers into the night just loud enough for Rio to hear.</p><p>"It's so easy to be overwhelmed by an alpha. You lose control over parts of yourself whether you want to or not at the whim of someone else."</p><p>Agatha let's herself zone out into the middle distance as she recalls what it was like being mated to Ralph.</p><p>"You become an extension of your alpha, like an extra independent appendage, walking around freely but still answering to an influence outside yourself. Even now there's something there telling me to fix it and make you happy."</p><p>"I feel it, too," Rio confesses to a mildly surprised Agatha.</p><p>"It's there, telling me to do everything in my power to make you happy. To make you feel safe."</p><p>Rio locks her eyes with Agatha's, almost daring her to look away.</p><p>"And I would."</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath, aware of the line she's about to cross; one that can't be taken back.</p><p>"I love you," Rio says shakily as Agatha stares at her in disbelief.</p><p>Agatha's glassy eyes dart back and forth over Rio's face, searching for any hint of a lie as Rio stares back openly.</p><p>"I know you're scared, you have every right to be but despite what you believe, you're not a coward, Agatha."</p><p>The omega's gaze sharpens as she regards Rio suspiciously for a few beats.</p><p>Rio hides nothing, meeting Agatha's eyes with a knowing look.</p><p>"You watched it."</p><p>It's not as accusatory as Rio expected as Agatha's eyes narrow when Rio nods.</p><p>"I did. I was going to email my therapist but then I saw it," Rio replies sheepishly.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she offers when Agatha burns with embarrassment. "But if you let me, I'd spend whatever time we have together showing you how loved you are."</p><p>Agatha squirms under the sincerity, tears falling steadily in two rivulets because she wants what Rio offers so badly her body shakes not quite believing she gets to have this without paying a price, but she can't deny how good it feels to know Rio loves her and that as much as Agatha is drawn to the alpha, Rio also can't ignore that feels it just as much.</p><p>Rio slips off the stool and kneels in front of Agatha, taking both her hands between hers.</p><p>"You'll never be an extension of me. I don't want that," Rio promises, squeezing Agatha's hands.</p><p>Rio brings Agatha's hands to her lips, kissing her knuckles reverently in subservience, easily assuming the typical posture of a traditional omega, putting Agatha above her in the position of power.</p><p>"You said I deserve everything I want," Rio ducks her head to catch Agatha's eyes, looking up at her, heart laid bare.</p><p>"I want you."</p><p>Agatha is crying but she doesn't pull away and Rio can smell her heady scent, meant to draw the alpha to her and it gives Rio hope, taking Agatha's hands in hers to kiss her open palms.</p><p>Rio gives her a tentative smile and Agatha lifts her fingers, touching Rio's brow and skimming down the slope of her cheek.</p><p>"You're insane," Agatha breathes, staring at Rio in wonder as her protests fall away one by one. She has no resistance left, nor does she want to fight herself any more, not when Rio sits at her feet begging for a chance to prove Agatha's fears wrong.</p><p>In the face of the alpha her fear evaporates like morning mist.</p><p>Rio makes her feel brave.</p><p>"I love you," Agatha whispers, "More than anything."</p><p>Rio's grin is bright enough to rival the moon in the night sky and Agatha is blanketed in the alpha's warm scent that makes her omega rejoice, elated to be the reason for Rio's smile.</p><p>"It's terrifying," Rio nods, "But you're worth every risk."</p><p>"And if you change your mind?"</p><p>Rio's alpha protests loudly at the thought and she shakes her head.</p><p>"Not about you. Never about you."</p><p>"You can't predict the future..."</p><p>"And neither can you," Rio interrupts. "But you're not powerless, you never were, and no matter what you choose, I'll be here because I want to be."</p><p>Rio covers Agatha's hand, pressing it against the side of her face.</p><p>"That's my choice."</p><p>Agatha caresses Rio's face and Rio stares so hopefully up at her, like Agatha holds the answers to life's secrets, a precious treasure to be awed at.</p><p>Rio blinks slowly and tilts her head into Agatha's hand like she's grateful for the touch.</p><p><em>Not a treasure</em>, Agatha thinks, finding Rio's worshipful gaze again when she opens her honey-colored eyes.</p><p>A goddess.</p><p>Agatha draws Rio's face closer, urging the other woman to sit up on her knees so Agatha can kiss her slowly, returning Rio's offering in the form of her blessing, trying to fit all of her stubborn emotions into her touch as her hand settles over Rio's rapidly beating heart.</p><p>Rio kisses her back gently then with more force as her feelings surge and she holds Agatha's face in hers, drinking her in as if she's kissing her for the first time, opening the dam to let her feelings flow freely.</p><p>"I love you," Rio whispers when they finally break apart, pressing her forehead against Agatha's as they both breathe quietly, sharing the space so intimately, Agatha can feel Rio's breath against her lips when she speaks.</p><p>"I couldn't let you decide without telling you."</p><p>Agatha wraps her arms around the other woman, parting her knees to give Rio space to move closer as the alpha returns her embrace, face buried in the crook of Agatha's neck, inhaling deeply and splaying her hands over the omega's back.</p><p>Agatha sighs and her body relaxes, leaning her head against Rio's. She wants to apologize for the stress she's put Rio through and thank her at the same time for her patience but her capacity for words has nearly met its limit for the night.</p><p>She's emotionally wrung out, breathless and exhausted but euphoric, like running to the top of a hill to watch the sun rise and basking in the cool morning light. Her body and her omega want to offer her neck for Rio to mark but she resists for the moment.</p><p>Agatha knows better than most that sometimes things looked different in the light of day and Banner had given her a week to decide; it feels foolish to make a rash decision after such a large declaration.</p><p>But at least now the tension between them is somewhat eased, removing a large weight that rested on both of them, giving them a freedom of affection that has Agatha sighing in relief, seeking Rio's touch like a balm to soothe her wounds.</p><p>"Is it okay if I take some time?" The omega asks hesitantly, afraid of hurting Rio again.</p><p>"It doesn't change how I feel about you," Agatha rushes to add, ears metaphorically pressed against her head in submission and appeasement, afraid to upset the fragile peace between them.</p><p>For a moment Agatha slips in to old habits, bracketing Rio's hips with her thighs and subtly arching closer, using her scent to pre-emptively placate the alpha.</p><p>"It's okay," Rio soothes, sliding her hands to Agatha's waist to still her movement, scenting the bit of distress under the layers of pheromones meant to assuage any anger.</p><p>"Take your time, <em>mi amor</em>," Rio whispers as Agatha bites back a smile, turning her head to hide her face in Rio's hair though she can't quite contain the pleased whimper that leaves her throat.</p><p>Agatha can feel Rio's smile against her temple and relaxes again, slumping against the alpha and finally noticing the cold, shivering as Rio leans back to rub her arms.</p><p>"Ready to go inside?" Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha nods and reluctantly lets go, letting Rio stand and smirking as Rio hisses when her knee cracks.</p><p>Rio pinches Agatha's side and offers a hand for Agatha to take, helping her up from the loveseat and leading her back inside.</p><p>Rio turns off the television and folds the blanket, taking care of the lights on their way to the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha stretches her neck and reaches for the buttons on her blouse to begin the arduous task of undressing but Rio's hands on her hips give her pause, turning around to face the alpha who takes over for Agatha.</p><p>There's no amorous intent behind Rio's touch, just that same gentle reverence as Rio pushes her blouse from her shoulders and puts it aside.</p><p>Rio brushes the back of her fingers against Agatha's arm, watching goosebumps rise in their wake.</p><p>Rio moves to Agatha's slacks, letting the loose fabric fall to the floor and kneeling to collect it and put it aside with Agatha's blouse. Her hands rest on the outside of Agatha's legs as Rio kisses each one, standing slowly as her lips travel upward, leaving a trail from Agatha's stomach to her ribs, each shoulder and finally a lingering kiss against Agatha's lips.</p><p>Reaching around Agatha's body, Rio unclasps her bra and adds it to the pile of clothes to be washed, retrieving the Quantico shirt from Agatha's things and motioning for Agatha to lift her hands so Rio can place it on her.</p><p>Normally Agatha would have made a remark about being able to dress herself but she's enjoying the attention and allows Rio to continue doting on her.</p><p>Rio changes her clothes quickly and leads Agatha by the hand to the bathroom, reaching for Agatha's make up wipes and leaning back against the sink as she swipes over Agatha's skin, kissing her forehead when she's finished.</p><p>They brush their teeth and after, Rio finger combs the tangles from Agatha's wavy hair as Agatha practically purrs, eyes slipping shut briefly as her scalp tingles.</p><p>Agatha huffs quietly when Rio stops and the alpha chuckles and leads Agatha to bed, laying on her back so the omega can pillow her head on Rio's chest and she can resume playing with Agatha's hair.</p><p>The silence is comfortable, neither feeling the need to fill it after saying the most important things, quieting their thoughts now that they don't have to guess at the other's feelings, happy to exist in the wonder and newness for a while.</p><p>Agatha traces her fingers over Rio's chest, feeling the steady beat of her heart beneath her cheek, reveling in the ability to nuzzle her nose against Rio's skin without shame, needing no further explanation to do so other than she loves the way it feels and the way it stirs Rio's scent.</p><p>The alpha hums and Agatha smiles, she loves all of Rio's sounds, how the timbre of her voice changes when she's tired or aroused or content; she loves the slight curve of Rio's shoulder and how it perfectly fits her head and how the alpha's fingers feel in her hair, tugging and combing and sending pleasant tingles down her spine.</p><p>Agatha shifts herself closer, tangling their legs together and pressing her nose against Rio's neck; if she had the option to climb into Rio's body at that moment, Agatha would take it in a heartbeat to satisfy her need for closeness.</p><p>Rio happily complies with being half-smothered, thrilled to discover and accommodate the uninhibited clingy side of the omega.</p><p>Rio doesn't expect Agatha to say those words again any time soon; between the two of them, Rio is the more vocally affectionate while Agatha tends to be conservative, re-learning how to give and accept affection and praise at face value.</p><p>But it's hard to doubt the omega's feelings as Agatha settles, her leg possessively thrown over Rio's, face tucked against her and fingers twitching against her chest as she dozes.</p><p>Whatever happens, they'll be together.</p><p>Rio drops her lips to Agatha's hair and closes her eyes, following Agatha in to slumber and letting herself sink into the mattress as the rhythm of their breaths align in content.</p><p> </p>

<p>Some how everything changes and nothing does. </p><p>When Agatha wakes in the morning curled around Rio, it takes a moment for her mind to catch up through the haze of sleep, tensing for a brief moment when she first remembers the pain then relaxing a bit when she recalls sharing whispered confessions under the moon.</p><p>There is still some nervousness and embarrassment that washes over Agatha as it's always done when she feels like she's been overly vulnerable. Just as a pendulum swings as far in one direction, it swings back in the other and Agatha finds herself wanting to take it back to protect herself, old habits pulling her fiercely in the opposite direction. </p><p>But when Rio wakes, blinking and squinting and turns over to greet Agatha with a sleepy grin, those thoughts dissolve like morning mist and she gravitates to Rio like she's the sun, needing her light to bloom. </p><p>"Hey," Rio murmurs, stretching with her arms above her head, pointing her toes and arching her back as her muscles tense and Agatha takes in every detail greedily, no longer hesitant about her open appreciation of the alpha as she rakes her eyes over the outline of Rio's ribs and chest and up to the alpha's knowing smile. </p><p>"I like it when you look at me," Rio confesses easily. "It feels like you want me."</p><p>"I do," Agatha replies with as much ease, surprising even herself with her honesty.</p><p>Waking up together is nothing new to them, they've done it enough times to fall into routine, but the free-flowing connection between them is new and such a relief; removing the metaphorical filter between her mind and her mouth, realizing now how much she had previously policed her thoughts. </p><p>Like a mind reader, Rio brushes Agatha's hair back from her face and asks her what she's thinking. </p><p>"I feel...raw," Agatha replies after a pause. It isn't good or bad but she definitely feels overly sensitive and that could go either way. </p><p>Rio nods in understanding; Agatha's grief, fear, and sadness are cloaked in a thick shell of anger that protects her like a shield. This softer version of Agatha is like a newborn, fragile and easily overwhelmed, not yet fortified to face the harshness of the world quite yet. </p><p>"Regrets?" Rio asks evenly and Agatha shakes her head slowly. </p><p>"Just...new," Agatha scoots forward to brush her nose against Rio's. </p><p>Rio meets her kiss with languid tenderness and hums when Agatha's leg hitches over her hip.</p><p>Her hand curls over Agatha's thigh but before she can get too carried away, a thought occurs to Rio that needs to be discussed if only because it will bother Rio if she waits until after...</p><p>"Is...this isn't an apology is it?" Rio winces; she can't quite figure out how to say what she wants to without it sounding like she's accusing Agatha. </p><p>"Sorry," Rio apologizes immediately, "I mean, you don't have to do things... for me, I'm not upset, you don't have to make up anything..."</p><p>Agatha looks at her curiously, brow furrowing as she tries to understand and Rio blushes, embarrassed that she can't seem to find the words to explain her concern.</p><p>Rio huffs, "Last night, you thought I'd be angry and you sort of scented like sex..."</p><p>Agatha looks a little surprised and Rio wonders if Agatha even realizes she was doing it or if it's such an ingrained habit that it came to her like a knee-jerk reaction. </p><p>"I didn't realize..." Agatha confirms her unawareness and Rio holds tight to Agatha's leg to keep her in place. </p><p>Rio rolls her lips over her teeth, feeling a little guilty about pointing it out. Agatha's gaze drops to Rio's shoulder, and Rio can almost hear her thinking, going over memories in her mind to see whether or not Rio is right in hindsight. </p><p>"I... don't know how else to make you feel better," she finally concludes. </p><p>"That's not your job," Rio tells her gently, smoothing her thumb over the soft skin under her hand in comfort rather than arousal. </p><p>"Isn't it?" Agatha asks skeptically.</p><p>Isn't that the domain of an omega? To keep the peace of the home? </p><p>"No, of course not," Rio scoffs. "Can you imagine, with my job?"</p><p>Agatha is forced to agree, knowing the type of work Rio is involved in, it would be exhausting to cater to the kind of trauma found in case files. Still, though, Agatha is so used to evaluating another's mood that it's a difficult habit to drop. </p><p>"You're not responsible for my feelings," Rio assures, watching Agatha work through her thoughts. </p><p>"I mean, I like that you care enough to want me to feel better, but it's not your responsibility to change my mood," Rio continues. </p><p>The alpha leans forward, nudging Agatha's cheek and kissing the corner of her mouth and each eyelid. </p><p>"When you offer yourself, I want you to do it because you love me and you want me," Rio murmurs, trailing her lips down the front of Agatha's throat to her sternum. </p><p>"Not because I'm upset." </p><p>Agatha's eyes flutter shut and she hums contentedly as Rio looks up at her adoringly. </p><p>"Understand?"</p><p>Agatha smiles fondly and nods, brushing the backs of her fingers against the side of Rio's face. </p><p>"Good," Rio growls playfully and Agatha's smirk blooms into a smile. </p><p>Rio smacks Agatha's thigh playfully and Agatha yelps out of surprise rather than pain; her body is starting to wake up and respond to Rio's touch, not opposed to the sting that fades into a light tingle. </p><p>"Now...breakfast," Rio taps her again and Agatha pouts as the alpha slips from bed, prompting Agatha to do the same, choosing to forego pants in the name of comfort and because Rio seems to enjoy the view. </p><p>She likes it when Rio looks at her, too. </p><p>"Be patient," Rio takes Agatha's hand, twining their fingers together.</p><p>"We have time."</p><p>-------------</p><p>Turns out Rio's patience only lasts about as long as it takes her to drink a cup of coffee.</p><p>"Oh, God, yes," Agatha breathes, her hips jumping as her stomach dips and stretches under Rio's relentless tongue.</p><p>Agatha's fingers curl around the edge of the table, trying to be mindful of the coffee cups near her head though it's getting harder to concentrate on anything other than the way Rio devours her weeping cunt.</p><p>Harmless banter had turned into flirting and once Rio's eyes darkened, pupils dilating, Agatha had braced herself for the pounce, draping her arms over Rio's shoulders as she's maneuvered to the dining table.</p><p>Agatha's chest arches toward the ceiling as Rio's fingers speed up and the walls of her cunt flutter, climbing quickly toward release and nearly squealing when Rio takes her clit between her lips.</p><p>Rio can tell Agatha is close, recognizing the way her breathing stutters and her legs tremble and twitch. On her next thrust she adds a third finger, using her knowledge of the omega's body to give her exactly what she wants.</p><p>Agatha gasps, head falling back as her stomach tightens and the string of pleasure running through her body grows taught, her cunt pulsing as Rio fucks her through her climax until Agatha falls limp against the table.</p><p>Rio licks her lips and cleans her fingers with decadent swipes of her tongue and swipes at her chin when she's finished.</p><p>Agatha pushes herself up to sit and pulls Rio up until she's standing between her legs, tasting herself on the alpha's tongue as she meets her lips eagerly and reaches for the front of Rio's briefs.</p><p>Rio hesitates for a second, pulling her mouth away and placing a hand on Agatha's forearm.</p><p>"Shhh," Agatha coos, brushing Rio's hand away, "I know."</p><p>Agatha tugs at Rio's briefs freeing her cock and wrapping her fingers around feverishly warm skin, moving her hand slowly from base to tip and over again.</p><p>A wave of relief washes over Rio when she realizes Agatha isn't trying to pull her inside, humming low in her throat as she leans into Agatha's hold, claiming her lips in silent gratitude.</p><p>It's an understanding that Rio wouldn't be able to explain well and she sighs in relief; the next time she's inside Agatha she's either going to claim her or already be claimed. The temptation to bite is too overwhelming at this point and Rio's self-control is threadbare.</p><p>Agatha's fingers trace the head of her cock, slipping against the beads of moisture leaking from the tip as Rio's hips stutter and rock, seeking more attention, prompting Rio to grasp at Agatha's hips and pull them closer, trapping Agatha's hand between them, gripping tightly as the head brushes against Agatha's stomach.</p><p>Rio squeezes her eyes shut; its just enough for her to imagine she's inside Agatha where she wants to be, rolling her hips up into Agatha's firm grip as the omega's legs squeeze around her.</p><p>"You feel so good," Agatha purrs.</p><p>Goosebumps appear on Rio's arms. Agatha knows Rio well enough to know she loves hearing Agatha whether she's moaning or talking and while Rio is withholding from thrusting inside of the omega, Agatha uses it, whimpering quietly next to Rio's ear.</p><p>Rio's steady rhythm falters for a moment and Agatha grins, knowing she's got her.</p><p>Agatha pumps her hand faster and turns her head to rake her teeth over an earlobe.</p><p>"Just like that, baby," Agatha breathes as Rio regains her momentum, head dropping to Agatha's shoulder with a pained groan, inhaling her scent until her senses are overcome with nothing but the omega in her arms and the hands wrapped around her, playing her expertly.</p><p>Agatha's fingers stroke the head of her cock while her other hand tightens around the base, thumb brushing against the sensitive spot there that makes Rio gasp and twitch in her hands.</p><p>"Fuck!" Rio surges forward, "I'm gonna come if you keep doing that."</p><p>Agatha grins and kisses Rio's shoulder, massaging her hand at the base of her cock and adding pressure with her thumb again and this time she can feel the muscles in Rio's stomach and thighs constrict as she lets out a broken moan.</p><p>"That's the idea, my love," Agatha coos, repeating the motion again and again until every sinew is pulled tight in Rio's frame.</p><p>Rio's breathing stutters and stops for a moment, her mouth dropping open as her body shudders and she swells against Agatha's stomach, the slick head of her cock reddening and releasing, staining pale skin with her seed as her hips twitch when Agatha moans in turn, both missing the feeling of fullness.</p><p>Rio pants against Agatha's shoulder as her hands slow and Agatha brings her hand to her lips, cleaning the stains from the web between her forefinger and thumb, licking her lips with an obscene 'pop' when she's finished.</p><p>Rio chuckles breathlessly and leans back, relinquishing her hold on Agatha's bruised hips and caressing them in apology.</p><p>"Stay," Rio points at her with a playful grin as she rights herself and Agatha is immediately tempted to do the opposite but stops herself when Rio moves for a cloth and wets it at the sink.</p><p>She cleans the mess on Agatha's thighs and stomach and retrieves her discarded underwear, helping Agatha back into them and off the table, sweeping her around with an arm around her waist and an off center kiss hindered by the way their lips smile against each other.</p><p>"I'm going to starve to death at this rate," Agatha chides lightly, scratching her nails down Rio's shoulders as the alpha's lips skitter over her jaw.</p><p>Rio nips at Agatha and grins, "Dehydration is more likely."</p><p>"It was a statement not a challenge," Agatha pinches Rio's butt and the alpha yelps, uncharacteristically high-pitched as Agatha's head falls back and she laughs, full throated and carefree.</p><p>It's the most beautiful thing Rio has ever seen, wishing for time to slow so she can remember this moment forever.</p><p>It's quickly over-taken by the sight of Agatha walking away from her, Rio's shirt falling from her shoulder, bare legs glowing in the morning light and hair lightening in the sun as crystal blue eyes look back, shining in invitation to follow.</p><p>Goddamn.</p><p>Rio follows; unable and unwilling to resist.</p><p>She's never going to get enough of this woman</p><p>-------------</p><p>Their days pass much in the same way as before aside from the affection that's more than doubled from Agatha, choosing to sit near Rio as they work, brushing her fingers over a waist as they maneuver in the kitchen, the conversations that continue even when Agatha steps into the shower, leaving the door open so Rio can hear her.</p><p>And Rio eats all of it up, a little surprised at how tactile this softer version of Agatha is, almost as if she's starved for human touch, needing to fill a deficit like Rio is her own personal reserve.</p><p>And Rio has so much to give.</p><p>On the third day, Agatha cautiously approaches the topic of living arrangements once the trial is over.</p><p>Rio feels her out just as cautiously, leaving it open to Agatha whether they live together or apart and Agatha shyly shows Rio some bookmarked listings with enough room for two, timidly admitting it would be too big of an adjustment to be on her own entirely but that if there's enough room for them to have their own spaces and of course a yard, it could work.</p><p>Besides, she's going to sell the house she shared with Ralph, why not use that money toward a new life?</p><p>Rio kisses Agatha's temple and takes the laptop, looking through each one with Agatha tucked against her side as they compare and debate the merits of different areas, preferred layouts, and decorative choices, leaving no doubt as to the future they both want, making plans with both their dreams in mind.</p><p>Between plans for their future and meetings about evidence and testimony with prosecutors, Agatha steadily builds her life back, emailing with Lilia and arranging to start working again and more frequent texts to Jen that begin to sound like their old banter, a sign that the world is falling back into place, creating a promising landscape for new dreams.</p><p>More often than not, Agatha finds her hands and mouth wandering when they have an idle moment, exploring her new appreciation in watching Rio try to hold out while Agatha's mouth coaxes her down her throat or testing Rio's concentration, stroking her with deft hands as she tries to make lunch.</p><p>Half the time, Agatha isn't even intending to tease to alpha but she'll find herself coming on Rio's fingers, task interrupted and panting and crying out in pleasure against whatever surface Rio deems fit enough for the moment.</p><p>It's on the fifth day, when Rio trades out with another agent for the day to Agatha's displeasure, the higher ups deciding to pull Rio away to discuss new evidence that Agatha is not allowed to be privy to.</p><p>The agent is cordial and Agatha maintains a professional distance, leaving him to the living area while she retreats to the bedroom, mood cloudy now that her routine has been disrupted and it occurs to Agatha once she's safely alone:</p><p>She hasn't considered the serum once.</p><p>Agatha has been so excited to finally surmount the biggest hurdle of their feelings that she completely forgot there's still a choice to make.</p><p>Is it even a choice at this point?</p><p>Her skin grows heated and a wave of tingles rushes to her toes and back up to her heart and she feels dizzy enough that she needs to sit down on the bed, unsure if she's having a panic attack or if she's just overwhelmed with the certainty of what she needs to do.</p><p>Agatha flexes her fingers a few times and begins to move slowly but with purpose, gathering items from the spare linens and bathroom.</p><p>When she goes to gather things from the living room, she catches the replacement agent's eyes and he nods politely, working at the table and seemingly ignoring Agatha after that though she knows better than to mistake ease for a lack of vigilance.</p><p>She's at least thankful for the facade of not being perceived.</p><p>Agatha checks the time and texts back and forth with Rio throughout the day; it's mostly Rio pouting about better uses of her time as Agatha scoffs and assures her she'll be back soon, the thought making Agatha nervous and excited as she holds her small surprise in mind.</p><p>Rio is later than anticipated, Agatha nervously making dinner and wondering if she should offer some to the agent when Rio comes through the door, jacket over her arm and a grocery bag heavy with items.</p><p>Agatha bites her lip to keep herself from beaming at the alpha as she greets the other agent and thanks him for taking her assignment for a bit.</p><p>Rio responds so genially that Agatha wonders if she's going to invite him to stay but Agatha relaxes when Rio ushers him to the door, apparently just as eager to have Agatha to herself after a long day.</p><p>Once the door closes, Rio abandons the grocery bag by the front door and moves for Agatha, the other woman meeting her halfway and clasping her hands around Rio's back.</p><p>Rio kisses her soundly and brushes Agatha's hair over her shoulders, looking her over as if anything might have changed in the last eight hours.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late but I come bearing gifts," Rio sways them back and forth a bit and pecks Agatha's lips again before she releases the omega to retrieve the grocery bag and take it to the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha follows and watches Rio unpack the bag, putting groceries away as she waits for said gifts.</p><p>Rio produces a bottle of wine and Agatha nearly claps her hands together and takes it excitedly, searching for glasses and an opener.</p><p>"I thought you'd enjoy that," Rio smirks and produces a bakery box with a small tiramisu.</p><p>"I got you some books, too, just in case. I've been meaning to ask about supervised trips, I know you're probably sick of seeing this place and the inside of an office all the time."</p><p>Agatha twists the cork out of the bottle neck with a 'pop' and feels her heart ache with what she knows now is love, touched at the way Rio tries to anticipate her needs.</p><p>Agatha pours them both a glass and hands one to Rio, "Thank you, my love."</p><p>Rio melts and hides a blush behind a sip as Agatha grins in turn, watching the alpha devolve into a bashful mess, making her more sure of what she's planning.</p><p>"Dinner?" Agatha offers, turning to the stove and watching Rio's expression.</p><p>Rio sniffs and looks over at the stove, her face lighting up in surprise, "You made arroz con pollo?"</p><p>"I tried to," Agatha replies, trying to temper Rio's expectations though she's fairly proud she's managed to recreate it.</p><p>"It's the first thing you made for me," Agatha explains. "Comfort food."</p><p>Rio's rosy cheeks seem to glow and she presses her lips against Agatha's cheek, "Sounds perfect."</p><p>Agatha makes two bowls for them and hesitates for a second, wondering if they should sit at the table instead of their usual sitting on the couch and watching TV.</p><p>A part of her snags on the idea that this should be more formal, like sitting at a table would validate the gravity of the situation but Rio takes her bowl and settles on the couch, grabbing the throw blanket and shaking it out for Agatha.</p><p>Somehow this feels right; their routine ingrained after so much repetition, creating an indelible mark on both their lives the same way Rio has made a space for herself in Agatha's heart.</p><p>Agatha joins her on the couch and turns on a show, adjusting the blanket to share as she chooses another show about couples scientifically, spiritually, and sociologically chosen to marry and then following their journey to see if they remain married after a trial period.</p><p>Agatha silently sympathizes with some of the couples struggling with emotional intimacy, seeing the obvious mirror in her own relationship and she wonders if Rio thinks the same, unable to discern her thoughts through the silence.</p><p>Small lies threaten to tear one of the couples apart and Agatha kind of agrees with the omega on screen, if it were her she would leave knowing what she knows now. If her partner is willing to lie about something small, what else would they lie about?</p><p>Rio seems to agree when she snorts at the alpha's explanation, nose scrunching as she finishes her mouthful of food.</p><p>They eat and watch in comfortable silence, Rio doing the dishes when they're done and Agatha wrings her hands together nervously, noting the parallels of her own decision with those on screen.</p><p>Agatha reaches for the remote and shuts off the television.</p><p>It's time to focus on her own story.</p><p>Rio steps back into the living area, her hands still a little damp and her rolled up sleeves splashed with water, sit high on her forearms, highlighting the muscle there and Agatha can feel her mouth go dry.</p><p>"Done, already?" Rio asks with some concern. It's late but not late enough to head to bed and she had been ready to ask if Agatha wanted some tiramisu.</p><p>But the look in Agatha's eyes halts Rio in her tracks and she stands frozen as Agatha stands and walks toward Rio, taking her hand and lacing their fingers together.</p><p>Rio closes her eyes and inhales deeply and feels a stirring in her stomach, recognizing Agatha's scented arousal and squeezing her hand in acknowledgement.</p><p>Agatha leads Rio to the bedroom, hoping Rio doesn't feel the way she trembles in anticipation but of course, Rio notices everything.</p><p>"Everything okay?" Rio wraps her arms around Agatha's waist as she twists the knob to the door and lets it swing open, revealing the makeshift nest she created during the day.</p><p>It's nothing elaborate, a few extra blankets and pillows and some tea candles and matches she found in the bathroom and pantry.</p><p>There's so much more Agatha wishes she could have done; Rio deserves it and Agatha silently vows to herself to make it up to the alpha as soon as she's able.</p><p>They have time.</p><p>Rio for her part stands frozen in the doorway, her mind trying to reconcile that she's looking at and what it means, looking to Agatha for help, too scared to get her hopes up.</p><p>Agatha nervously leads Rio to the bed, standing next to it and taking Rio's hands and kissing them in an echo of the alpha's previous affections.</p><p>"I've never been so intensely, <em>consumingly</em> happy than when I'm with you," she says haltingly, rubbing her thumbs over Rio's fingers to soothe her nerves and give her courage.</p><p>"But if it's possible, I would be even happier, if you would be my mate."</p><p>Agatha notices she's not the only one shaking now and Rio pulls her into a fierce embrace, clinging to Agatha like a lifeline as Agatha cups the back of her head and clutches at Rio's shirt.</p><p>"I would be honored," Rio murmurs, her response muffled by Agatha's shoulder and though she had no doubt, Agatha sighs in relief and melts into Rio's frame.</p><p>Agatha is nervous, not for the act but in anticipation of the pain. Going through the process once has Agatha preparing herself to bite her lip to keep herself from crying out as she bares her neck to Rio.</p><p>Rio leans back to look, lifting her hand to Agatha's neck and brushing her thumb over the silvery scar, making Agatha shiver for a different reason, feeling the arousal spark to life in her belly.</p><p>Rio leans close, her breath brushing over skin as Agatha tries to relax and keep the tension from seizing her body. Agatha nearly jumps when instead of a sharp piercing, Rio's lips caress the sensitive skin there, Agatha squeezing her legs together as her underwear grows wet.</p><p>"I want to make you feel good first," Rio whispers, her hands going to Agatha's hips, rucking up her shirt to reach skin, quickly divesting Agatha of the barriers that keep Rio from putting her mouth where she wants.</p><p>Agatha's bralette follows and Rio lowers her head to a pink nipple that calls for her attention, enveloping it between her lips and flicking her tongue against the pebbled flesh while her other hand pinches the neglected breast, drawing ragged breaths from the omega squirming against her.</p><p>Rio fits her leg between Agatha's, encouraging her to rock forward while the alpha plays with her nipples until they're red and glistening from her attention and Agatha presses impossibly closer, seeking more to drive her pleasure higher.</p><p>Rio gives Agatha her fingers, slipping her hand down the front of Agatha's pants, expertly parting her folds and spreading the slickness she finds there until two of her fingers, press down on Agatha's clit, the omega jerking forward into Rio's hand with a surprised cry.</p><p>Agatha's fingers grasp at the front of Rio's shirt, arms trapped between them as she tries to grind her hips, hooking her leg up onto Rio's hip to give her more access.</p><p>Rio keeps her pressure firm as her fingers move in quick circles, building Agatha up quickly as she begins to pant against Rio's neck and her body starts to quake, signaling the quickly approaching orgasm as Agatha's slick coats her fingers up to the knuckle.</p><p>"Oh fuck, oh fuck, Rio," Agatha whimpers and Rio grins, thankful for the warning as she abruptly stops and draws her hand from Agatha's pants, licking her fingers as Agatha cries out in protest.</p><p>Agatha's body cools down fairly quickly though her cunt aches for release and she pushes her thigh against the line of Rio's cock standing out prominently in the front of her pants, trying to coax Rio into giving her what she wants.</p><p>Rio hums and kisses Agatha lightly, "Soon," she promises, directing Agatha to sit on the bed. "I want you desperate first, I don't want to hurt you more than I have to."</p><p>A flush of warmth washes over Agatha and she looks up at the other woman, eyes shining with gratitude and prompting her to fall to her knees and reach for Rio's waist, fingers deftly unbuttoning her slacks and tugging them down Rio's hips.</p><p>"This is supposed to be about you," Rio protests when Agatha's fingers curl in the top of her briefs but Agatha ignores her, freeing Rio's cock and wrapping her hands around it to hold it steady.</p><p>"I need you in my mouth," Agatha breathes, enveloping the swollen head between her lips and moaning as her tongue tries to cover every bit of skin she can reach.</p><p>"Fuuuck," Rio groans, head falling back as her hand settles on the side of Agatha's head, brushing her hair away so she can watch the way Agatha's cheeks hollow and her glorious mouth sucks and draws her in further.</p><p>She can't believe she has this beautiful, incredible woman on her knees in front of her, looking up at her with so much affection that she feels like she could explode.</p><p>As it is, Agatha bobs her head a few times, taking as much of Rio as she can, making her cock shine with her saliva as she swallows again, constricting her throat around Rio's girth, triggering Rio to jerk back and hold Agatha at a distance.</p><p>Rio gentles her touch when Agatha looks at her in confusion, "Too much," she explains.</p><p>"I'm not gonna last if you do that."</p><p>Agatha's smirk is smug and deservedly so, Rio can't think of another person who has tested her self control like Agatha. It's both intoxicating and torturous.</p><p>Rio unbuttons her shirt, peeling it from her shoulders as Agatha watches adoringly from her position at Rio's feet, trusting Rio to lead and keep her safe.</p><p>Agatha's eyes dilate as the final piece of clothing falls from Rio's form and she can't help but touch, smoothing her hands over the plane of Rio's stomach and up to her breasts, cupping them and squeezing gently as Rio sighs.</p><p>"Beautiful," Agatha murmurs and reaches for her own pants, stepping out of them and her underwear as they pool at her feet.</p><p>Rio leans in to claim Agatha's mouth again, both groaning in satisfaction at the feeling of skin against skin from head to toe.</p><p>Agatha climbs backwards onto the bed and Rio follows, hovering over Agatha as her lips map every bit of skin she can find. She nudges Agatha's legs apart and makes a direct path with her mouth toward Agatha's slick cunt, licking from bottom to her clit as Agatha moans and spreads her legs further, opening herself for Rio to take.</p><p>Rio takes her time, lapping at her labia, pointing her tongue and parting her inner lips, flicking her tongue against Agatha's greedy entrance and humming in satisfaction when Agatha clenches around nothing.</p><p>Agatha's fingers tangle in Rio's hair tugging to try and keep Rio's restless mouth where she wants it, her body arching when Rio passes over her clit in random intervals, teasing her with pleasure and making her jump when her lips finally close around her clit.</p><p>Her cries grow more frequent as her legs jerk and close around Rio's head and the alpha brings her hands to Agatha's thighs, holding her down during her relentless assault, wet sounds falling from her lips as she flicks her tongue rapidly.</p><p>Agatha writhes on the bed, the build up happening quicker than the first time, the familiar coiling in her legs and stomach growing tighter and tighter as Agatha bites her lips trying to keep herself from crying out and giving away just how close she is, but Rio knows her too well, slowing her movements as Agatha clenches her teeth together, her growl dipping into a whine, making her displeasure clear.</p><p>"Impatient little thing," Rio growls and Agatha feels a fresh wave of arousal flood between her legs, wishing in this moment that Rio would use her like a 'thing', growing desperate to relieve the burning arousal that is slowly taking over her consciousness.</p><p>Rio's thighs press up against Agatha's and the omega nearly cries out in relief, hoping her torture is coming to a close, but Rio takes herself in hand and drags the head of her cock against her slit, using it to tease Agatha further as the omega growls from deep in her chest.</p><p>"Fuck me," Agatha demands, circling her hips and reaching between them to push Rio toward her needy cunt but Rio snatches her wrist and holds it tightly against Agatha's stomach.</p><p>"Be good, <em>mi amor</em>," Rio warns lightly. The phrase itself and the hint of authority makes Agatha mewl as she tosses her head back in frustration, the length of Rio's shaft gliding agonizingly close to her entrance but never inside.</p><p>"Take me," Agatha pleads, her body buzzing with need as her omega cries out with want, releasing her pheromones to entice the alpha.</p><p>"Shhh, soon," Rio coos but Agatha isn't pacified, gripping Rio's forearm with her free hand to get her attention.</p><p>"Alpha, please," Agatha is reduced to begging, rocking her hips wantonly, trying to appeal to the alpha directly.</p><p>"I don't want to..."</p><p>"You won't," Agatha cuts her off, catching Rio's gaze with her own.</p><p>Agatha loosens her fingers and strokes the firm muscle under her palm.</p><p>"I trust you," Agatha murmurs, tugging Rio closer, encouraging her to rest her weight over her body and bringing her legs high against Rio's hips.</p><p>"Let go, my love," Agatha murmurs against Rio's lips.</p><p>Rio's alpha agrees with Agatha, demanding to take control, to finally fulfill her purpose and claim the woman beneath her, marking her permanently as hers.</p><p>Her hesitation falls away as she studies Agatha's face, taking in the softness around her eyes and the hopeful expression asking Rio to trust her with the parts of her that scare her.</p><p>Rio inhales Agatha's sweet scent that makes her alpha salivate and cautiously loosens the reigns, her pupils dilating as her instinct comes to the forefront, her scent changing to something more primal and entirely carnal.</p><p>The omega can't help but respond, driven by deep seated need, programmed into her very DNA, stomach swooping when Rio's eyes harden to obsidian.</p><p>Rio surges forward, all teeth and lips, pushing her tongue past Agatha's lips to claim her mouth as she reaches between them to steady her cock, pushing against Agatha's dripping cunt and filling her all at once and sinking her teeth into Agatha's lip on a groan.</p><p>Agatha chokes on a cry, feeling the sudden stretch that steals the breath from her lungs, hands finding Rio's shoulders as her eyes roll shut in equal parts relief and pleasure. It isn't that Rio fills a missing part of her; Agatha has always been whole, but Rio unlocks parts of her Agatha thought were long dead, depths of feeling she never thought herself capable of are all suddenly accessible and, more impressively, freely given.</p><p>"Yess," Agatha hisses as Rio rocks her hips forward to grind against her clit. She locks her ankles around Rio's lower back and squeezes her thighs as she chases the feeling, drawing quiet gasping breaths whenever she gets the angle just right.</p><p><em>Mine, </em>Rio's alpha begins to chant and all thoughts of drawing out Agatha's pleasure disappear from her mind; there's time for that later, right now the chanting in her head syncs with the beating of her heart, drumming a rhythm that Rio can't help but follow, pulling her hips back to drive them forward again and again in cadence as Agatha's nails create bright spots of pain against her shoulders.</p><p>Rio clenches her molars together when Agatha's cries get louder, echoing in her ears and joining the chant, a salacious treble that moves in time to create a perfect melody of bodies, changing key as her climax builds rapidly after being denied.</p><p>She angles her hips, gasping when the blunt head of Rio's cock pushes against her cervix and the thought of being bred, of having a child with this woman she loves so much, pushes her over the edge, her orgasm slamming into her harshly and carrying her away with the power of a flash flood as she pulls Rio down on top of her, desperately clinging on to brave the currents and tilting her chin toward the ceiling, baring her neck where Rio can see the flutter of her pulse.</p><p>Her fangs sharpen.</p><p>Her alpha screams.</p><p>
<em>Now, now, NOW!</em>
</p><p>Rio moves on instinct, clamping down on the base of Agatha's neck until she tastes blood.</p><p>Agatha's grasping hands tense as the haze of pain begins to push back against the heat in her veins and she can't stop the urge to try and jerk away.</p><p>Rio's alpha tells her to hold on a little longer; she grapples for Agatha's hands, pinning them down by the wrist on either side of Agatha's head.</p><p><em>Oh. </em>Agatha's cunt pulses and tightens again as she gulps down air, surrounded inside and out though her body feels like it's expanding, growing beyond its physical form to fill the room, or maybe it's her spirit leaving her body.</p><p>Her eyes roll shut and distantly she can hear herself wailing but everything sounds like she's underwater and soon she even feels like she's floating, unable to feel the sheets or Rio's weight on top of her; just a pure weightlessness that feels like peace.</p><p>Rio's hips have stopped moving, her strength and concentration focused on making sure the claim sticks.</p><p>She understands the biology behind the instinct; her saliva needs time to bond with Agatha's hormones and over a 24 to 48 hour period, the bond will have travelled through the omega's body, biologically sealing them together.</p><p>But nothing could have prepared her for the real thing.</p><p>Rio is sure she's drunk on Agatha. A pleasant haze settles over her senses and it feels like Agatha's scent is magnified a hundred times, bringing every good feeling and memory she has to the surface as she rolls her hips, grinding her pelvis against Agatha's inner thighs, not willing to pull out when Agatha's walls grip her harder, begging her to stay.</p><p>Their small movements start to add up again and the knot at the base of Rio's cock flares as if reading her mind, swelling quickly and locking them together as Agatha's body practically lifts off the bed, sliding from one orgasm into the next, her moans ragged and almost distressed though she scents the opposite.</p><p>Agatha tightens around Rio and the alpha can't hold back anymore, feeling a heat surge from the top of her head and down her back, muscles tensing and shaking as they flex and contract, jerking forward and coming in spurts, emptying herself over and over until her stomach burns from the tension and her arms shake with exertion.</p><p>When her alpha finally settles Rio releases her jaw, lapping delicately at the new wound as Agatha writhes beneath her, whining with overstimulation as she shudders and sinks heavily into the mattress.</p><p>
<em>Mine.</em>
</p><p>Rio's tongue finishes cleaning the mark, knowing the ragged edges will eventually heal but guilt seeps in and she places a kiss against the angry skin in silent apology.</p><p>She rolls them to the side, pulling Agatha's leg over her hip for comfort as they wait for her knot to go down.</p><p>Agatha groans at the slight shift, still sensitive but too tired to protest further as she tucks her head against Rio's and drapes an arm over a slim waist.</p><p>There's no pain from the mark though Agatha knows there will eventually be discomfort, but for now all she can feel is her heartbeat in every part of her body as her hearing and sense of touch gradually return.</p><p>Rio pushes Agatha's hair away from her neck, studying the mark with satisfaction and resisting the urge to trace the edges if only to give the omega a reprieve from further stimulation and a her cock a chance to soften lest she remain in Agatha all night.</p><p>Her cock twitches inside Agatha traitorously and Rio huffs in amusement.</p><p>"Okay?" Rio asks with some trepidation and Agatha grunts in response, punch-drunk on the hormones running through her body, limbs limp and boneless with exhaustion.</p><p>With some effort, Agatha opens her eyes just enough to see the hazy details of Rio's face through her unfocused gaze as she licks her parched lips.</p><p>"Yours," she whispers on an exhale.</p><p>"Mine," Rio's answer rumbles in her chest, the sound resonating in her ears, grateful to finally be able to say it out loud.</p><p>"<em>Mine," </em>Rio repeats a little louder and the corner of Agatha's mouth tilts upward as she contracts her inner muscles with intent.</p><p>Rio chokes and swallows hard to clear her throat, "Okay, nevermind that's definitely yours."</p><p>Agatha laughs, adding heat to the simmering arousal in her lower belly, letting herself give in to desire despite her weariness, not willing to deny herself or Rio, at least for tonight.</p><p>Tonight is for indulging and yielding and grasping their piece of happiness, and for marveling at the beauty of finding a safe haven in a tumultuous and violent world.</p><p>"Mine," Agatha murmurs fondly.</p><p>"Always."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>They fall asleep at some point during the early morning, tangled together as much as their scents that fill the air, too exhausted to rise for a shower, their bodies deciding to rest for them when their energy dips into the negatives.</p><p>For Agatha it's a blissful, dreamless sleep, burrowing into the blankets until only her nose, eyes, and hair peek out above, pillowing her head on Rio's chest, shifting together when one of them moves, in sync even in sleep.</p><p>When she wakes only four hours later, Agatha is surprised at how awake she feels.</p><p>Agatha shifts and stretches, tightening and elongating her muscles, curling her toes and pressing her hands against the headboard. She revels in the ache of her body; the lingering pain is a reminder that this is real. There's a stiffness in her shoulder and Agatha is suddenly possessed with the urge to look at the mark.</p><p>She slips from the bed, the cooler air chilling her bare skin as she pads softly to the en suite bathroom, leaving the door cracked open.</p><p>After taking care of her bladder, Agatha stares at herself in the mirror as she washes her hands, eyes immediately drawn to the wound in the curve where her neck meets her shoulder.</p><p>It looks violent and Agatha worries Rio will be upset. The skin is bruised; bright red that hasn't yet faded into the typical purple and green, and the indents are dark red, a thin scab already starting the healing process and making each puncture tight when she moves her arm too far in one direction.</p><p>But Agatha doesn't see carnage; a clean bite with no dragging means a shorter healing time and a neater scar and it's deep enough that Rio won't need to bite her again to make sure the mark sticks. Agatha only sees intent; Rio following through on her wish to cause her the least amount of pain.</p><p>Searching through her things, Agatha finds some antibacterial ointment meant for scrapes and burns and dabs a bit on her neck just to be safe. She thinks about applying lotion but ultimately decides against it.</p><p>She wants the mark to scar.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha jumps, too distracted to hear Rio's approach but it quickly morphs into a rumbling warmth that tumbles through her chest and stomach.</p><p>The alpha leans against the doorframe, arms crossed over her chest as she studies Agatha and offers a half smile.</p><p>"Don't be," Agatha turns back to the mirror and tilts her head.</p><p>"It's beautiful."</p><p>Rio winces, trying to see the beauty in it when she has seen similar injuries hidden by her mother's clothes and tightly pressed lips, remembering the bruises around Agatha's neck in the shape of fingers.</p><p>Agatha senses Rio's hesitation as if it's her own, toes curling against the cold floor. She can't help but compare her past and present experiences and marvels at how much more connected she immediately feels to Rio, wondering if it's her own bias or if there's a scientific explanation.</p><p>"It's beautiful to me," Agatha insists, tugging Rio away from the doorframe and into the mirror with her, wrapping her arms around Rio's waist and meeting her eyes through their reflection, tilting her head in admiration.</p><p>"I love it."</p><p>Rio melts and tears her eyes away from the mirror to look at the woman in her arms, filled to the brim with pride, marveling at the strength of the omega.</p><p><em>Her </em>omega.</p><p>Rio's arm wraps around Agatha's back, her hand coming to rest possessively against Agatha's ribs just under her breast.</p><p>Agatha watches Rio's expression morph in the mirror, her thighs growing slick where she rubs them together. Rio looks at her with a combination of desire and pride that makes her preen, thrilled to be the focus of Rio's attention.</p><p>The alpha moves behind Agatha, peeking over her shoulder with dark, playful eyes, brushing her other hand over the tops of Agatha's thighs.</p><p>Agatha spreads her legs, not bothering to hide how much she wants the alpha, nudging her ass against Rio's half-hard cock.</p><p>"Desperate little thing," Rio purrs, placing a hand on Agatha's hip to steady her.</p><p>Agatha hums and continues to grind her hips backward, remembering Rio saying something similar before.</p><p>"Is that what I am to you? A little thing?" Agatha's voice is like velvet, deep and rich in tone and just as soft. There's no hint of accusation, just a gentle banter that invites Rio to play along.</p><p>"<em>My</em> little thing," Rio purrs, slipping her hand over Agatha's hip and parting her with a single digit, a simple gesture like lighting a fuse that leads to an explosion, but Agatha is already burning with anticipation and meets Rio's eyes in the mirror.</p><p>"Prove it," Agatha challenges with a devious smile.</p><p>Rio's answering smirk is half hidden as she removes her hand in favor of freeing her cock, using her other hand to press between Agatha's shoulder blades, urging her to lean over the counter.</p><p>Heaven forbid she leave a challenge unanswered.</p><p>When the blunt head of Rio's cock slides past Agatha's entrance with ease, Rio grins and leans over to whisper in Agatha's ear.</p><p>"Your needy pussy is proof enough," Rio groans in satisfaction, pushing forward until her hips press tightly against Agatha's ass.</p><p>A long moan echoes off the bathroom walls and Agatha's eyes fall closed but as soon as they do, Rio leans over her back and cups Agatha's chin, lifting her head to look in the mirror.</p><p>"Open your eyes," Rio growls with enough intent that Agatha obeys, noticing her eyes are blown and her skin flushed but what draws her attention is the mark on her neck and the intensity in Rio's eyes.</p><p>"My sweet little thing," Rio purrs, running the edge of her teeth against Agatha's ear lobe and Agatha has to fight the urge to close her eyes again, lashes fluttering with the effort.</p><p>Rio sits up and pulls her hips back and buries herself in Agatha's warm cunt as the omega cries out sharply.</p><p>"Mine to fuck," Rio emphasizes her point with another thrust as Agatha rocks forward with the momentum.</p><p>There's a tingling that feels like static buzzing around her mark and Agatha assumes it's Rio's claim taking firmer hold when it travels through her chest and down toward her stomach.</p><p>"Mine to take," Rio moves faster, body quaking every time her hips collide with Agatha's ass.</p><p>Rio leans back and looks down, watching Agatha's cunt swallow her length and her vulva split around Rio's girth when she pulls out, the sight urging Rio to move faster, wanting to hear Agatha's cries fill the room.</p><p>"Fuck, yes, take me," Agatha turns her head and moans into her arm.</p><p>Rio grins, "I will."</p><p>Rio places her hand on Agatha's ass, fingers spread wide as her thumb brushes against the base of her cock where she's buried in Agatha until the pad of her thumb is slick with Agatha's arousal.</p><p>Rio resumes her pace and Agatha whines, high pitched and needy, lifting her head and letting it fall back on her shoulders.</p><p>Rio's smile is smug as she drags her slick digit to the ring of Agatha's ass, teasing and spreading the arousal like lube before pushing in, stopping at the first knuckle.</p><p>Agatha's head shoots up as she gasps and her hand braces on the edge of the the counter.</p><p>Her wide eyes find Rio's steely challenging glare in the mirror as she battles with the new sensation of intrusion and fullness, choking on a moan when Rio thrusts and hooks her thumb, triggering Agatha to arch her back and lift her hips, her other hand reaching out to press flat against the mirror, desperate for some kind of leverage.</p><p>"Holy shit," Agatha gasps, parting her legs further, indulging in the sinfully obscene feeling of being entirely spread apart for her alpha.</p><p>Rio's lips split in a feral grin, all teeth as she wiggles her thumb further, using that and the grip on Agatha's ass to pull her back onto her swollen cock as Agatha's cries out, lips parted and eyes closing as her head falls forward, pressing her forehead against the cool granite surface.</p><p>Rio stalls and hooks her thumb, tugging upward until Agatha yelps and tilts her hips up at a severe angle, her eyes opening again to find Rio.</p><p>"Keep. Your eyes. Open." Rio punctuates her words in time with her thrusts and a heated flush colors Agatha's face and chest as her cunt starts to drip around Rio's cock.</p><p>"Is this enough proof for you?" Rio growls, reaching forward to brush Agatha's hair away from her mark.</p><p>"You like it so much, you can keep looking at it."</p><p>Agatha's hair falls to the side and she desperately tries to keep her eyes open, fluttering at a drunken half mast, watching Rio pound into her from behind and the way her breasts bounce with every quake. At the forefront, her mark tingles, spreading through her chest and flooding her with hormones that have her gulping down air around ragged wails.</p><p>"More," Agatha sobs, her cunt clenching around Rio's cock which only makes her tighten around Rio's thumb, gasping sharply.</p><p>Rio lifts her eyebrows in surprise and mild amusement and pokes the inside of her cheek with her tongue. She withdraws her thumb and swipes her two middle fingers through Agatha's slick and works one, then a second against her backside until she stretches and gives and Agatha's face twists in open mouth ecstacy, her inner muscles fluttering and tightening in pulses.</p><p>Rio's stomach tightens and she feels the blood rushing through her veins as her cock swells and she works Agatha faster, driving the other woman higher and higher toward a peak that promises a steep drop that makes her stomach flip in anticipation.</p><p>"My desperate little thing," Rio grunts with affection and Agatha moans in confirmation.</p><p>"Yesss," Agatha's garbled cries fall from her lips and the tips of her fingers turn white with pressure as the crescendo begins to bloom just as Rio's cock finds that spot deep within that makes her scream, tumbling forward into her climax and free fall, her body shuddering and jerking as Rio presses up against her harder when her knees dip.</p><p>"Oh fuck! That's it," Rio uses her free hand to pull at Agatha's hips, driving herself as deep as she can go with her last few thrusts as a gutteral cry leaves her throat, emptying herself in pulses inside Agatha's twitching cunt.</p><p>They both pant, desperate for lungfuls of air as their sweat and cum slicked bodies cool down and eventually stop moving.</p><p>Rio drags her lips against Agatha's spine and Agatha hums, satiated as Rio's warmth blankets her skin.</p><p>"Good girl," Rio breathes, dropping a kiss to Agatha's shoulder blades as she lifts herself after a moment.</p><p>Agatha mewls and twitches, stomach elongating as she inhales sharply when Rio slides first her fingers then her softening cock from her body, humming as her body adjusts to the feeling of emptiness.</p><p>Rio slips an arm under Agatha's torso and pulls her upright, chest to back, smoothing her hands over Agatha's stomach.</p><p>"I meant it when I said, I'd have all of you," Rio murmurs and Agatha grins.</p><p>"Take it, it's yours."</p><p>-------------</p><p>The next few days are filled with spontaneous moments of love making and when reality slowly starts to creep back in and knock on the door of their little haven, they both reluctantantly emerge facing the world as a united force.</p><p>Agatha emails Dr. Banner to update him and she can swear she sees the smile in his cordial but friendly response, reminding her of an upcoming appointment to monitor her brain activity to confirm their hypothesis.</p><p>The serum is offered to Brenda's family, believing that the dual edge of her physical and mental injuries are preventing her from healing and waking.</p><p>They make the decision for her and Agatha wonders if Brenda will ever resent them.</p><p>But when it works and weeks later Brenda opens her eyes, Agatha thinks it might be one of the best decisions they could have made, but that's not Agatha's call to make.</p><p>She decides not to visit her when she gets a thank you note for "saving" Brenda's life, the other omega deciding it was Agatha's actions that saved her life once she's briefed on the relevant parts of the case.</p><p>It feels gross to Agatha. Had she chosen the serum, Brenda wouldn't have had this chance so accepting her gratitude is the last thing she wants to do.</p><p>It's similar feelings of guilt, shame, and stumbling vulnerability that drive Agatha to continue seeing Dr. Banner on a regular weekly schedule, recognizing that the other omega might have some good guidance though she'll never say it out loud.</p><p>Banner seems to understand, content with Agatha continuing to show up for their appointments and gently supportive of the new developments in her relationship with Rio.</p><p>Weeks extend into months and Rio is able to negotiate returning to her house, arguing that they can start to taper off the protection when no further threats arise.</p><p>It's good to be back in a familiar place and Agatha knows Rio is happy to be home, tending to her neglected and dying plants to bring them back to health.</p><p>It's quickly decided that Agatha's things now belong in Rio's room and Agatha secretly revels in being allowed into Rio's sacred space, noting pictures, small gifts, and books that seem to mean more to the alpha than some of the other things around her home. It feels like a glimpse into her person, one that Rio encourages; so casually making room for Agatha as her most valuable treasure, feeling like she's been given a place of honor.</p><p>It's the perfect stepping stone toward their new life.</p><p>And inevitably there are tests and stressors; preparing to take the case to trial means more prep with the team of prosecutors lead by a pretty red head with rounded features that make her soft enough to look approachable while her large green eyes cut across every microexpression, analyzing and calculating.</p><p>"Maximoff, Wanda," she extends her hand upon first meeting, respectful for an alpha, and Agatha is intrigued if not a bit hostile at first, testing the woman's ability to keep up much to Rio's amusement as she sits back and watches the two women volley back and forth in legal speak.</p><p>Agatha's main concern is the obvious weakness; her affiliation with Rio and the FBI, interested in how Wanda will navigate that when the defense for Versa inevitably bring it up. She doesn't like to think that their relationship is a detriment but it's an easy target to try and discredit Agatha's testimony, especially if they're desperate.</p><p>Rio only steps in when one of them gets close to exploding or when they look like they're about to launch across the table, fangs and claws bared.</p><p><em>Kind of a hot visual actually</em>, Rio muses when she herds a huffy Agatha for a break one afternoon.</p><p>Aside from protecting her relationship, Agatha's other concern is the implication, or the lack thereof, against the last partner, Ronald Davis.</p><p>Ralph is dead, a mountain of evidence stares Paul down, George is implicated in his ex-wife's attempted murder and appears on the recordings now in FBI possession...</p><p>Ron is the only partner without concrete ties to the testing, implicated on financial charges, but it doesn't stop the other two surviving partners from signing over their shares to Ron, protecting their assets in an obvious attempt to recoup and rebuild their losses.</p><p>Agatha is insistent that she <em>knows </em>he is involved and their charges won't stick, pushing for more discovery though Wanda argues they're out of time, having extended beyond what they're already allowed.</p><p>"If we make the financial fraud charges stick at least we'll be able to keep an eye on him and monitor if he starts to build another business," Wanda sighs, rubbing her temple in exasperation, "At least the FBI will be aware of him now."</p><p>It's the best they can do.</p><p>Agatha hates it.</p><p>Something nudges at the back of her mind, a small detail that stubbornly remains out of reach, ruffling Agatha's feathers and leaving her more grumpy than anything when they retreat back home.</p><p>Agatha starts to review her notes, writing down her memories over and over, not sure what she's looking for but hoping she'll know it when she sees it.</p><p>Sometimes Rio joins her, other times Rio will place a plate of food in front of her or nudge her to bed. The alpha knows better than to stop Agatha from obsessing when she would do the same. The least Rio can do is make sure she eats and sleeps.</p><p>Unfortunately by the time trial commences, her efforts haven't produced anything useful and Agatha is issued a date to appear in court.</p><p>The first day is spent waiting in a holding area with Rio and a paralegal from the prosecution team. It's boring and Agatha feels like she's trapped in a cage until they're released for the day with instructions to return tomorrow.</p><p>Agatha remains agitated for the rest of the afternoon and evening, understanding that the timeline of a trial isn't exact but she's always been sitting behind a desk, never behind the stand.</p><p>She has a new appreciation for some of her clients.</p><p>Rio is a steady presence, deferring to Agatha's expertise in the field and never once telling her to let go of her frustration as long as she doesn't direct it at the alpha or an unsuspecting clerk.</p><p>The second day Agatha is summoned, she waits about six hours before security informs them Agatha is needed.</p><p>Rio grasps Agatha's hand and squeezes in the few seconds they have, giving her a reassuring smile and holding the door open for Agatha to step out.</p><p>Agatha walks briskly, her heels tapping on the linoleum and wood floors, steeling herself before entering into the court room, picking a spot at the back to stare at so she doesn't falter at the assault of different scents as Rio's fades, muted in the sea of the filled courtroom.</p><p>The bailiff allows Agatha past the bar and she spares a glance for Wanda as she walks past, tilting her chin in a nod of acknowledgement.</p><p>Agatha takes her place on the stand as she's sworn to oath, smoothing her skirt and folding her hands in her lap, making an effort not to look at the jury; not yet.</p><p>Her eyes travel the rest of the courtroom, taking in some reporters, the prosecution, and the defense. George seems dejected and uninterested in her appearance but as her eyes travel to Paul, allowed a suit though his ankles are cuffed, he meets her gaze with smug bravado, like he knows something she doesn't.</p><p>The thought makes her uneasy and she breaks the eye contact in favor of staring at Ron who seems to be glaring at her and again something ticks in the back of her mind like an itch that she can't reach.</p><p>Wanda's voice breaks her train of thought and Agatha focuses, ready to answer their prepped line of questioning.</p><p>The first part is easy; establishing her name, her profession, and her relationship to the case, connecting Agatha to previous evidence and narratives that have already been introduced to the jury.</p><p>"Were you aware at all about the drug testing Versa was conducting?" Wanda starts to dig into the more important questions.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Did your husband at the time ever discuss his work?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Not even a little?" Wanda questions, preemptively attacking the most questionable parts of Agatha's credibility by establishing a clear timeline.</p><p>"He was very careful," Agatha shrugs. "I would ask but he would brush off my questions."</p><p>"So then what prompted you to leave him and turn to the FBI?"</p><p>Agatha can feel her hackles rising in anticipation and takes a breath through her nose.</p><p>"My husband was abusing me," she focuses on the facts. "It escalated to the point I feared for my life so I chose to leave."</p><p>"Why not a shelter? Or your mother? Why the FBI?"</p><p>Anger blooms in her chest but she has prepared for this and no doubt the defense asking the question first would not be so kind.</p><p>"My husband at the time was very well connected and monitored my phone and my work schedule. I feared he would find me if I escaped to my mother or a shelter."</p><p>"Did you feel you needed protection at the time?"</p><p>"Objection, leading," the defense pipes up and Agatha turns to look at the judge.</p><p>"Overruled," the judge replies and Agatha turns back to Wanda.</p><p>"Yes, I did," Agatha answers, matter-of-fact.</p><p>"And did the FBI require anything in return for their protection?"</p><p>"No. I've been cooperating by choice."</p><p>"And why is that?" Wanda's voice is softer, leading the jury like a conductor with her tone, painting Agatha as a sympathetic witness.</p><p>"Because what they did to me and others was violating and cruel..."</p><p>"Objection, speculation."</p><p>"And I want to make sure it never happens again," Agatha raises her voice just above the defense, ignoring the objection and finishing her statement quickly.</p><p>"Relevance, your honor," the defense continues to protest and Wanda backs off as the judge gives her a look.</p><p>"Sustained. Move along counselor."</p><p>Wanda nods, "Ms. Harkness, in your deposition you stated some of your memories of the events returned over time, is this true?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha replies.</p><p>"And you were encouraged by Dr. Banner to keep a record of what you remembered when those memories resurfaced?"</p><p>"Yes and I did."</p><p>"And how are you sure your recovered memories aren't false memories?"</p><p>"My recorded accounts were compared to mp4 videos of the testing that came into my possession when I left my husband. Dr. Banner verified that my recovered memories seem to match events recorded on video," Agatha repeats her prepped answer, grateful for her and Rio's fastidious tracking from early on.</p><p>"And from what you remember, can you say with certainty that Versa is no doubt involved in the creation and testing of this "designer drug"?"</p><p>"Without a doubt," Agatha replies confidently, spine straight with conviction.</p><p>Wanda nods and turns on her heel toward the defense, "Your witness."</p><p>The redhead takes a seat as the defense attorney rises, buttoning his jacket over his torso.</p><p>Agatha has already forgotten his name, though she's vaguely familiar with him through her own connections in the legal world.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness..."</p><p>"Ms," Agatha interrupts, narrowing her eyes as the attorney cows his head in feigned remorse.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness," he starts again effortlessly, "You say the FBI offered you nothing in return for your cooperation?"</p><p>"Correct," Agatha replies tersely.</p><p>"What if the offer didn't come from the FBI but one of it's agents?"</p><p>"Objection, speculation," Wanda protests immediately and Agatha clenches her jaw.</p><p>"Sustained," the judge replies and the defense lawyer paces leisurely.</p><p>"I'll rephrase," he cocks his head. "Would it be possible your relationship with Agent Vidal has influenced your decision to be cooperative?"</p><p>Agatha desperately wants to look at the jury to gauge their reactions but she refuses, if she looks now it will only make her look suspicious.</p><p>"No," Agatha replies firmly, "My relationship with Agent Vidal has no bearing on my decision to help bring my perpetrators to justice."</p><p>"Is there a way to prove that?"</p><p>Agatha resists the urge to snarl and notices Wanda watching intently, her team taking furious notes and murmuring to one another.</p><p>"Agent Vidal and I have been forthcoming with our relationship with the intention of transparency and have worked with the FBI to be sure any testimony and evidence is able to be verified by a third supervisory party."</p><p>It isn't a yes but it isn't a no and the defense attorney seems to know that as well but Agatha reminds herself she's trying to convince the jury, not him.</p><p>"But there's no way to be absolutely sure is there?"</p><p>Agatha squeezes her hands together, eyes hardening as she stares at the attorney.</p><p>"I suppose it's difficult to ever be absolutely sure about the influence of feelings which is why we-"</p><p>"That's unfortunate," he cuts her off and Agatha silently fumes. "And the "feelings" in your memories, would that mean you can't be absolutely sure of those either?"</p><p>"The logged accounts of my recovered memories were verified by Dr.-"</p><p>"Yes, you stated that but we just established that there's no way to be absolutely sure about a feeling, so could it be possible your memories are tainted by desire to seek revenge on your husband through his former partners, Mrs.- sorry, Ms. Harkness?"</p><p>Wanda's objection and Agatha's knee-jerk reaction come at the same time.</p><p>"Objection, badgering!"</p><p>"They're all involved!"</p><p>Wanda shoots Agatha a look that clearly tells her to shut her mouth and Agatha bites the inside of her cheek hard.</p><p>"Sustained. You're walking a thin line Mr. Buchanan."</p><p><em>So that's his name, </em>Agatha muses.</p><p>"Understood, your honor," he again ducks his head in performative apology.</p><p>"Let's go back a little," he sticks his hand in his pocket and brings a hand to his mouth like he's thinking.</p><p>Agatha wants to bash his head in.</p><p>"You said they're involved, meaning my clients," he swings back to gesture toward the men sitting behind the defense desk.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha grinds out.</p><p>"All of them?"</p><p>The question gives Agatha pause. She knows Ron doesn't appear on tape and there are no memories for her to fall back on to confirm his presence.</p><p>"It isn't all of them is it?" He asks, already knowing the answer and turning to address the jury.</p><p>"Ron Davis does not appear on any video, text, email, or memo related to the alleged crime."</p><p>He turns back to Agatha, "Can you confirm if you recall Mr. Davis from your recovered "memories", Ms. Harkness?"</p><p>"I don't," Agatha grinds out. The words taste bitter though they're truthful and again the tick in the back of her mind goes off, telling her she's wrong.</p><p>"You don't confirm or you don't remember Mr. Davis?" He asks for clarity.</p><p>A lump forms in Agatha's throat, frustrated at the direction of his questioning and that she had predicted something like this would happen.</p><p>"I have no memories of Mr. Davis," Agatha replies, willing her voice to remain level. "But I'm sure of his involvement."</p><p>"As sure as you are about your relationship not affecting a bias?"</p><p>Agatha sees red, her nails digging onto her palms leaving crescent indents in her fury.</p><p>How dare he assume anything about her relationship with Rio? The only thing her alpha is responsible for is giving Agatha the courage to follow through on testifying and burning Versa to the ground.</p><p>Agatha looks past the defense attorney, sweeping her gaze over the many pairs of eyes in the courtroom until she finds the one she wants, Rio standing near the back, both hands stuffed in her pockets, shoulders noticeably tense even at a distance and Agatha feels a surge of protectiveness, willing to do anything to protect her mate.</p><p>Just as she thinks it, a slight movement catches Agatha's attention and she watches Elizabeth Davis, Ron's wife, lean over the bar to whisper something to her mate.</p><p>
<em>Willing to do anything to protect her mate.</em>
</p><p>Agatha stares and finally the missing piece slips into place and her eyes widen a fraction in realization.</p><p>"Tangentially? I'm positive," Agatha bites back, surprising the defense attorney, knocking him back on his heels for a moment.</p><p>"Please, explain," he challenges when he recovers.</p><p>"From what I remember of the testing there were dedicated staff and nurses who monitored my vitals and administered medication intravenously," Agatha speaks quickly, avoiding the panic in Wanda's eyes.</p><p>They hadn't prepped this.</p><p>"Most wore masks but one nurse in particular wore a necklace; a pearl surrounded by diamonds on a silver chain."</p><p>Agatha stares directly at Rio who looks almost hopeful.</p><p>"The same necklace Elizabeth Davis is wearing right now."</p><p>Multiple things happen at once.</p><p>All heads turn to stare at Elizabeth, searching for a glimpse of her necklace.</p><p>Elizabeth raises a hand to cover the pendant.</p><p>The defense lawyer shouts an objection.</p><p>Wanda shouts for a recess.</p><p>Many voices blend together in a wave of buzzing and murmuring as the judge's gavel comes down and he calls for court to ajorn pending investigation.</p><p>Agatha is shuffled from the stand by the bailiff, Wanda's hand wrapping around her elbow and leading her to a side chamber.</p><p>Her inner omega snarls a bit, not happy with another alpha touching her but she quiets that part of her, certain Rio will find her soon. She always does.</p><p>The last thing Agatha sees when she looks over her shoulder is security and FBI converging on the defense table and the sudden worried looks of all three men.</p><p>The cacophony is silenced once the door closes behind them and Wanda releases Agatha in favor of placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>"What the hell was that?!"</p><p>"I think I just won you your case against all three men," Agatha replies flippantly. "You're welcome, counselor."</p><p>Wanda groans and pinches the bridge of her nose but says nothing because Agatha knows she's right.</p><p>"Dig a little deeper or put some pressure on her and I can guarantee she got involved at her husband's direction," Agatha continues and Wanda glances at her from behind a curtain of red hair.</p><p>"Or she could take the fall for him," Wanda points out and Agatha shrugs.</p><p>"Not my problem," she bites back acerbically.</p><p>Agatha could care less what Elizabeth Davis decides to do; the moment she turned on her own designation she damned herself to whatever fate awaits her.</p><p>
<em>Let's see if her mate protects her now.</em>
</p><p>The door opens again and both women snap their heads up, Agatha softening when Rio appears and shuts the door behind her.</p><p>"Elizabeth Davis is in custody, she's being transported to headquarters for questioning now."</p><p>Agatha's eyes linger on her mate, taking in her scent and presence and feels her body release some of its tension but Rio is all professionalism, waiting at a distance though her body seems to vibrate.</p><p>Wanda sighs heavily and waves a weary hand at Agatha.</p><p>"Go home. There's more work we need to do. Be prepared to return if needed."</p><p>Wanda turns on her heel and leaves, murmuring to herself while Agatha bites back her snarky remark, not wanting to prolong her time in court any more than she needs to.</p><p>Agatha's eyes find Rio's and her alpha nods with a faint smile.</p><p>"Home?"</p><p>"Home," Agatha nods.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Rio collapses on top of Agatha, both of them breathing hard, bodies slick with sweat and trembling in the aftershocks of pleasure. Agatha's drunken grin tugs at her lips, moaning indulgently when Rio's lips ghost against the sensitive flesh of her scar, spreading a tingling warmth through her limp body.</p><p>"Fucking incredible," Rio sighs, falling to the side and pressing her lips to Agatha's forehead as the omega chuckles.</p><p>As soon as they stepped through the door, all the vibrating energy in Rio's frame was released and Agatha found herself up against a wall as Rio babbled continuous praise, proud and awestruck by Agatha's cleverness, unable to express enough in words as she lets her hands worship, heart bursting at the seams.</p><p>Agatha wonders if she'll ever get used to this feeling.</p><p>Looking back on her darkest days, Agatha never thought she would end up here when her future has been uncertain for so long and looking forward, there is still so much to do.</p><p>Rio's warm smile fills Agatha's gaze and her stomach flips as her heart speeds up, over taking her worry and fueling the spark of hope until it burns and crackles like a fire, optimistic for her future for the first time in her life.</p><p>She tilts her chin and kisses Rio gently, a soft melding of lips and just enough pressure to remind her this is real.</p><p>She's in love.</p><p>And more importantly:</p><p>She is loved.</p><p> </p>
