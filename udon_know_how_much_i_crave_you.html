<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Agatha, this isn’t healthy,” Jen’s voice cut through the trance like a blade through silk—sudden, unwelcome, and far too familiar. “You cannot just run on pure ambition. You need nutrients and sleep.”<br/>“I’m eating,” Agatha huffed without looking up from her monitor.<br/>Jen’s eyebrow arched like it had been trained for this exact moment. She folded her arms, the picture of relentless exasperation, “Yeah, and what is it that you’re eating?”<br/>Agatha gestured vaguely toward the side of her desk, where a wilted paper bag slumped beside her trash bin. “Whatever takeout my assistant brings. There are salads,” she added, defensive now. “So there—nutrients.”<br/>Jen didn’t blink. “You take one bite and then vanish into your work for seven hours straight. By the time the smell starts bothering you, it’s already spoiled. Then you throw it out and say you forgot. Again. Look, all I’m asking is to give it a try. Call the service.”</p><p>OR Agatha is a busy business owner who is unable to feed herself properly. Her friends suggest a personal chef service. Enters Rio. Will she be able to help Agatha remember how to take care of herself again?</p><p>OR Personal Chef AU</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>For those who know me, welcome back, weirdos. I got possessed again!<br/>For those who don’t know me. Hi, I’m Steph.

These short stories are my tender getaway whenever I need to take a break from the loaded plot of my main fic.</p><p>This one was supposed to be a oneshot, but when I started writing, I realized that this universe Agatha has way too many bottled feelings for it to fit into a simple oneshot. So, now, I’m unsure how long it will take her to allow herself to love and be loved. But I promise, we’ll get her there!</p><p>I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it!

</p><p>“Agatha, this isn’t healthy,” Jen’s voice cut through the trance like a blade through silk—sudden, unwelcome, and far too familiar. Yet, Agatha didn’t flinch. She wasn’t drowning in cacophony, no. She wasn’t dizzy, either. Everything was under control. Agatha had full control of the situation. “You cannot just run on pure ambition,” Jen pressed. Ah, right, Jen. Still here. Still talking. “You need nutrients and sleep.”</p><p>“I’m eating,” she huffed without looking up from her monitor.</p><p>Jen’s eyebrow arched like it had been trained for this exact moment. She folded her arms, the picture of relentless exasperation, “Yeah, and what is it that you’re eating?”</p><p>Agatha gestured vaguely toward the side of her desk, where a wilted paper bag slumped beside her trash bin. “Whatever takeout my assistant brings. There are salads,” she added, defensive now. “So there—nutrients.”</p><p>Jen didn’t blink. “You take one bite and then vanish into your work for seven hours straight. By the time the smell starts bothering you, it’s already spoiled. Then you throw it out and say you forgot. Again.” Agatha narrowed her eyes, calculating. She didn’t appreciate being read like a quarterly report. Jen, unfazed, kept going. “Billy’s one of my long-time customers. We chat when he comes by to pick up his skincare.”</p><p>“Do you have anything else to chat about other than my personal life choices?” They were ridiculous, really. Agatha had it under control. Supplements, infusions, blood purification, and IV drips existed. There were peptides and steroids, for crying out loud, in case things get way too far for vitamins alone to sustain her system. There was nothing that Agatha’s money couldn’t fix, health included.</p><p>“They’re called human connections, Agatha. Maybe try it sometime,” Jen’s voice was flat, but the concern underneath was impossible to miss. Agatha said nothing. Jen clicked her tongue and added, “This is what caring looks like. Something you’re incapable of recognizing unless it’s tied up in quarterly reports.” Still, Agatha didn’t rise to the bait.</p><p>Jen sighed but didn’t stop, “You can’t live like this.”</p><p>“I’ve been living like this for the past fifty years,” Agatha objected, “and I made it this far, haven't I?”</p><p>“You weren’t on your own that whole time,” Jen shot back. “And back when Wanda was around, you were at least eating. Sleeping. Not just subsisting like a well-dressed vampire.” Wanda had been cooking, true. But Wanda also had a problem with Agatha building an empire, so Wanda has been cooking elsewhere for a long time now.</p><p>“Correction,” Agatha said crisply, raising a finger. “That <em> bloody witch </em> was trying to control me. That’s not called <em> care </em> , that’s called <em> micromanagement </em>.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes so hard it was a miracle they didn’t get stuck, “Look, all I’m asking is to give it a try. Call the service.”</p><p><em> The service. </em> Jen had been trying to convince her to try personal chef service for months now, like some kind of desperate intervention. However, the mere idea of some stranger in her house was making Agtaha’s skin prickle, not to mention letting said stranger use her kitchen and make her food—the food she was supposed to consume, to put inside her body. What if it was poisoned? Agatha was not paranoid, no. But one couldn’t help but wonder which gains exactly those personal chef services were pursuing.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Jen carried on, “Lilia is Alice’s friend, Agatha, not some rando with a knife fetish. It’s not like you’re opening your door to an unknown potential psycho who would skin you in your sleep.” Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but Jen cut her off with a look. “You don’t sleep,” she added dryly. That was inaccurate—Agatha <em> did </em> sleep. She slept a good total of four hours last night—an hour more than the entire last week. “But that’s a different crisis.” Ah, right, Jen. Still here. Still talking. “Right now we’re dealing with <em> this </em>,” she gestured grandly to the coffee table, which was covered in a chaotic arrangement of vitamin bottles, half-empty protein shake cartons, and a pile of electrolyte packets. Like a shrine to aggressive self-maintenance.</p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. “Jennifer, I am no longer conversing with you unless you’ve scheduled this intervention properly and come with an agenda,” she said instead, trying to keep it together.</p><p>“I <em> did </em> schedule it. I’m your six o’clock,” Jen smirked, unbothered. “Which, coincidentally, is the time a <em> normal person </em> might eat dinner. Not a meeting slot. But hey—who am I to fight your calendar worship?” No, seriously, Agatha needed to scream. Possibly into a pillow. Possibly directly into the sun.</p><p>Despite popular assumptions, Agatha Harkness was not a workaholic. Yes, she worked a lot—all the time, actually—but few understood that it wasn’t ambition driving her. It was habit—habit Agatha didn’t have the energy or desire to change. A survival instinct calcified into routine. A long chain of quiet catastrophes that left no room for stillness.</p><p>It started when she was twenty-seven. After weeks of sleepless nights and excruciating self-reflection, Agatha finally accepted—with a heavy, silent heart—that she was a lesbian. Traumatic experience number one. That revelation led to the unraveling of her marriage. Ralph, her high school sweetheart, was blindsided. Traumatic experience number two. Then, later that year, came the end of her world.</p><p>Her son, Nicky—her light, her heartbeat, her soul—died. Sudden. Senseless. Shattering. That wasn’t traumatic experience number three. That was the extinction of her life.</p><p>The divorce finalized itself like a footnote, irrelevant by then. She was absolutely alone and lost—she didn’t know what to do, where to go, or how to keep living. Nothing held her in Westview anymore, so one day, she packed two suitcases—just clothes—and left. She didn’t take photos. She didn’t take keepsakes. She left the corpse of Agatha Bohner behind, sold the house and everything in it, reclaimed her maiden name, and disappeared into the anonymous enormity of New York City.</p><p>She didn’t launch her company right away. She didn’t even work. For months, she simply... existed— just crying herself to sleep every night, waking up the next day to the breakfast of antidepressants with a side of agony, roaming in a fog till late, only to repeat the cycle again. And again. And again. Those were the darkest times in her life. You might expect that at her lowest, she met someone. A turning point. A salvation. But no. That wasn’t the case. It had been Agatha herself all along. There was no divine encounter. No significant event. No special person. Just her. </p><p>One morning, still numb and sleepless, she decided that enough was enough. If the universe wanted her broken, she’d make sure it regretted the attempt. She would claw her way back. She would crawl out of that grave and take, take, take—as much as needed to cover the cost of what she’d lost. Because she was Agatha fucking Harkness, and she would never let something so insignificant as a god or a fate leave her rotting. No, she would rise and burn everything around.</p><p>The concept of a PR and marketing firm came to her like a lightning bolt—sudden, crackling with energy. It felt right—full of life. And just like that, Agatha’s new life had begun. She was spending all her time and energy on building the company, and she was damn good at it, too. Agatha was ruthless and magnetic. It didn’t take long for her name to become recognizable, synonymous with influence, and the business to bloom. At thirty-three, Agatha was already building something unstoppable and could confidently say she was set for life.</p><p>She met Jennifer Kale at thirty-six—an idealistic entrepreneur with bright eyes and impossible optimism. Despite their differences, they clicked instantly. Jen’s fledgling cosmetics brand exploded under Agatha’s guidance. The friendship followed soon after. Thanks to Jen’s network, Agatha’s business never lacked clients. She kept growing. Kept building. Kept busy. And slowly, the grief receded. Not gone—but quieter. A shadow at the edge of her vision. Still, she never stopped. Because she knew: if she let up, even for a moment, the pain might return. And if it returned, it might win this time.</p><p>So, no. Agatha wasn’t a workaholic. She was just... cautious. And if working all the time kept her safe from getting buried alive in hell again, she would damn sure work her ass off until she passed out from exhaustion. Reboot after a couple of dreamless hours on caffeine and muscle memory and carry on. It worked for her perfectly fine. She had everything under control.</p><p>Most days were fine. Some days, she even managed more sleep than usual, and on those days, she was basically flying—sharp enough to slice the world open. Other days were not that great. But such was the cosmic law of balance, right? Something bad followed something good, and vice versa. The great duality of life. Agatha was not a philosopher; some things were just unspoken truths. So, yes. Some days sucked, but Agatha faced them with grace, knowing that this state won’t last forever and better days would come.</p><p>Today was one of the shitty days. It started with a headache that cracked behind her eyes the moment they opened. Three ibuprofen and a steaming cup of coffee later, she was halfway through her makeup routine when a sudden wave of nausea hit her. Back to square one—no ibuprofen and coffee in her system. She pushed through it. She always did. Work was a mess. Meetings moved. People forgot things. Agatha’s carefully orchestrated day began slipping out of tune, and everything around her started tasting a little chaotic. Still, Agatha wouldn’t let it get to her. Billy was exceptionally annoying today, trying to <em> nurture </em> her again, which she had told him <em> repeatedly </em> she did not require. He crossed a line when he brought her a box of pastries from the bakery across the street. Agatha sent him home early. Technically late—it was well after six. But still. Early.</p><p>Which was how Jen caught her off-guard, showing up bright-eyed and infuriating. Agatha had no idea they had this meeting. Jen was exceptionally annoying today, too. Why was it that when you had a slight headache, everything became times more overwhelming? More loud. More sharp.  It felt like all your nerves were laid bare, and the slightest movement nearby was going right straight through your system, hitting your temples with that drilling pressure. It’s like the universe was doing that on purpose, testing your limits. When it rains, it pours, they say.</p><p>When she finally made it home, it was just past midnight. Early, by her standards. She almost smiled. But coming home early meant she had time to think. And that was never ideal. She moved straight to the bathroom, opened her medicine cabinet... and discovered she was out of melatonin. Seriously? Billy was supposed to restock—</p><p>Right. She’d sent Billy home early today. Double ugh. But Agatha was resourceful. No melatonin, no problem. She had chamomile tea. A triple dose should do it. She was on her second cup when the nausea hit her again. Agatha inhaled deeply and stood up to grab some water. Suddenly, everything went black and became very, very quiet. Seriously, what was wrong with today? Was there something in retrograde or whatever is happening with the stars when they just don’t align? Agatha blinked her eyes open. She was on the floor. Oh. Okay. That has never happened before. She frowned and looked around, slightly disoriented. Her eyes caught a glimpse of the clock on the wall—a quarter to two. She blacked out for more than an hour. So… Maybe Jen was right, and her lifestyle was a <em> mild </em> concern. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>Back at the counter, a water glass in hand, Agatha weighed her options. It was true—these people were friends with her friends, so not complete strangers. If Alice vouched for someone, they usually turned out to be decent. Most of the time. All the time. Alice was such a ridiculously good judge of character that it was annoying. Besides, there was an NDA, so Agatha really didn’t have anything to worry about. And she could cancel anytime if anything felt off.</p><p>She grabbed her phone. She would start with just dinners, see how it works out, and then go from there. One meal at a time. Determined, she nodded and started typing an email. She needed to send it now, before morning arrived with second thoughts and excuses.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Agatha worshipped her calendar. She read it every morning, not like a newspaper but like the sacred text. So that’s why she noticed one particular name stood out immediately. <em> Rio Vidal. </em>Agatha didn’t schedule any of her meetings herself, Billy did, but that didn’t mean she was unaware of every block of time, every person walking through her doors. She knew her schedule like a psalm. She knew every single entry in her calendar and could tell you all the details you could possibly want to know off the top of her head, even when woken up in the middle of the night. She knew every client by name, with at least three personal facts to match. Not to brag, but she was damn good at her job. The photographic memory helped a little, too.</p><p>So when she saw her twelve o’clock, she frowned. “Billy,” she stabbed the intercom button.</p><p>His voice crackled through instantly. “Yes, your majesty,” he chirped, and not two seconds later, he came breezing into her office like a court jester summoned to entertain. “How can we, the noble eunuch, serve Her Highness today?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, crumpling a sheet of paper from her desk and hurling it at his head. He caught it midair with one hand and clutched his chest with mock horror. “Abuse!” he gasped. “Assault in the workplace!” She hated this kid. He was the most annoying person in her life—constantly on her nerves. She would probably die without him.</p><p>William Kaplan was the son of one of her oldest clients. She met him when he was just a teenager, tagging along to the meetings with his mother, Rebecca. Agatha remembered like it was yesterday how Billy would just quietly sit in the corner of her office, wide-eyed and attentive, soaking up every word like a sponge. It didn’t come as a surprise to her when, eventually, he gathered his courage and asked if he could intern at the office. It was clear he was interested in this particular field of practice. Agatha, assuming it would be a temporary gig for him, accepted the offer. Years went by, and Billy was still there—he learned quickly, ferociously, memorizing her habits, her routines, her temper. He was keen to learn something new every day—he was that unstoppable, little ball of ambition, full of dreams. Billy reminded Agatha of Nicky. That probably had something to do with why she’d let him stick around. She liked having him there. It felt... less empty.</p><p>One day, he told her he was enrolling in night classes at CUNY. Agatha expected him to burn out, to choose between school and work. But he didn’t. He burned at both ends instead, turning into Agatha—never sleeping, barely eating. But he never quit. He got his master’s in Marketing and PR. He wasn’t just her assistant anymore—he was her right hand. She was sure, once she decided to retire, this young man would be more than capable of taking over the company.</p><p>“I’ll show you abuse if you don’t explain what the hell this is,” she said, jabbing a perfectly manicured nail at the name on her screen.</p><p>Billy sauntered closer, hands tucked into the pockets of his overpriced slacks, “You mean your twelve o’clock?”</p><p>“No, I mean the phantom appointment that just materialized on my calendar without my approval. <em> Obviously, </em> the twelve o’clock.”</p><p>His grin widened—slow, smug, and very, very irritating. “Your personal chef service scheduled an introduction meeting,” he said.</p><p>“I was under the impression my point of contact was Lilia Calderu," Agatha said, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“She is,” Billy said brightly. “Ms. Calderu called this morning, double-checked your allergies, preferences, caffeine dependency levels—”</p><p>Agatha gave him a sinister glance. “Very funny,” she cut dryly. </p><p>“—and then she assigned a chef. This meeting’s with the chef," he explained.</p><p>She leaned back slowly in her chair, eyeing him like he was a suspicious substance on her rug, and let out a low hum. Goddamn, New York City gays worked fast<em> . </em> Impressive. Mildly alarming. Somewhat exciting. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>The meeting was going terribly. Everything was bad. Very, very bad. It was a catastrophe. And this was unfair. This was so unbelievably unfair and also a little suspicious. Was this intentional? Had Jen and Alice planned this all along? Were they conspiring behind her back? Because how would you explain the woman who was currently sitting across from Agatha? She was gorgeous. Absolutely, undeniably, and achingly gorgeous. Agatha <em> needed </em> to scream to let the steam off, or she was going to explode. Get younger friends, they said. You may pick up a thing or two from them, they said. No shit, the art of conspiring and betrayal. Because was that a setup? Because besides what Jen was calling being sleep-deprived and starving herself to death, Agatha has also had a questionable love life. Lack of love life, to be precise. Who had the time for a relationship, anyway? Everything was under control. Agatha had full control of the situation. Jen was just being dramatic. Three hours of sleep were enough to keep Agatha going. Caffeine existed. Supplements existed. She had it under control.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness?” the gentle voice sliced through her spiral. “Are you listening?” </p><p>What kind of question was that, of course, she’s been listening—they were in a meeting, for crying out loud. Something-something, rosemary—big brown eyes—thyme. It should be illegal to have personal chefs with such mesmerizing eyes. It shouldn’t be allowed to be this dreamy and provide any kind of customer service because <em> goddammit </em> . It had been <em> far </em> too long since Agatha had experienced anything resembling intimacy. She didn’t even have time to get herself off, nor did she have any desire anymore. At least, that’s what she thought right until fifteen minutes ago, until her future personal chef arrived for their introduction meeting.</p><p>She cleared her throat, shifting in her chair. “Agatha,” she said instead, avoiding the question because, honestly, she had no idea what the woman had said in the past seven minutes. “Please call me Agatha,” she smiled softly, which was another thing on the list of things she’d been lacking. A genuine smile was such a rare occasion for Agatha that it felt foreign now—not unpleasant, just odd. </p><p>The chef nodded, her own smile turning warm in that quiet, devastating way, “Okay, Agatha.” And oh, lord, have mercy on her worn soul—the way her name rolled off the woman’s tongue ignited something deep inside of her. She wanted to hear it again. And again. And then some more. And maybe in the quiet of her bedroom, whispered into her collarbone. “Call me Rio.”</p><p><em> Rio </em> . Any other time, Agatha would find a name like this dumb, lacking taste, lacking grace. Not now. Now, Agatha was mentally repeating it on loop, imagining how it would sound like screami—<br/><em> No. Stop. Pull it together. </em></p><p>She needed to calm down. It was just a pretty girl, whom she clearly had absolutely no chance with. Maybe Jen had a point, and lack of sleep and nutrients were turning her a little delirious. But just a little. Not that she would ever admit it, of course. She would never admit that she was a little attracted to the chef, either. Not that it mattered anyway because the woman was clearly way too young for her, and Agatha was sure someone like Rio would never pay her a second glance. It was fine—she could still enjoy the view, right?</p><p>Agatha forced herself to sit straighter, slipping into CEO mode. She folded her hands on the table, businesslike. “I will be honest with you,” she said briskly. “I don’t require any fancy, five-star Michelin meals. Just a nice home-cooked dinner would be more than appealing,” she said softly than she intended.</p><p>It felt odd—talking about this felt odd. It felt vulnerable, saying it. Like she was confessing something. Like she was admitting to being lonely. Which she wasn’t. Obviously. Her way of living was her deliberate choice. She was strong, bad bitch, she didn’t need anyone. But Rio didn’t know that. Agatha couldn’t quite understand why it mattered, however. After all, Rio was just a hired service. It shouldn’t have mattered. It was a business transaction—meet, discuss the menu, part ways. So why did it feel like a casual conversation then? The type of conversation you had to get to know each other.</p><p>“Simple meals sound perfect,” Rio said, her tone so gentle it felt like a warm, soothing balm, pouring over Agatha’s beaten, scarred soul. “I prefer simplicity over image, too.” Her smile was so genuine that Agatha found herself wanting to smile in turn.</p><p>She was just tired, and the woman was too pretty. It’s been a while since Agath has been one-on-one with a woman as pretty as Rio, so it was only natural that her fried brain responded. It wasn’t a big deal. She would probably never even see her again. They agreed that Rio would come over every day around four, prepare a meal, and leave it for Agatha in the oven for reheating later, when she gets back from work. And since Agatha never returned before midnight, the probability of them running into each other was zero. That sounded like an easy business setup. Now, Agatha just had to wait and see if Rio’s food was edible. Although judging by her personality and the way Agatha was undeniably connecting with her, there was no way her food tasted bad. Sometimes you could tell just by looking at a person—they’ve got their act together and everything they touch turns out well. Agatha could tell Rio was one of those people. She struck her as a smart, composed individual who clearly worked out, obviously cooked, and took care of herself. </p><p>The fact that Rio clearly went to the gym was something Agatha noticed right away. The woman was wearing a pantsuit with a crisp white button-down. And while her arms and upper body were somewhat covered by long sleeves and a blazer, her pants were hugging that ass like a glove. And, oh, lord have mercy on Agatha’s worn soul, she should’ve really stopped staring at her ass. But that was such a perfect ass. That was an ass of a person who clearly squated regularly and did hip thrusts with discipline. Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>Luckily for her newfound libido, Rio was sitting for the rest of the meeting, which did help, but not by much, as she’s been gesturing a lot, and Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes off of her hands. Agatha had a thing for hands in general, not in any kinky way or anything of that nature, just aesthetically. She found long fingers and delicate wrists attractive. And, boy, did Rio have long fingers. And, boy, did Agatha need to calm down—she had absolutely no clue what they were talking about. It was nothing like her—normally, her mind was sharp during a meeting. Normally, she would dominate the space and make the experience memorable. Maybe it was due to the fact that she wasn’t trying to sell her services for once that she subconsciously let her guard down and mind wander. Maybe it was due to the fact that there was something about this woman—something she couldn’t quite understand. She’d met attractive people before, obviously. She had experienced lust and desire. She had had crushes. This… felt somehow different. Agatha didn’t know what that was—didn’t know whether she wanted to analyze it even.</p><p>They settled on a test run tonight. Agatha had no idea what Rio was going to cook as she agreed to something on autopilot. Honestly, Agatha would have agreed to filet of cardboard if Rio said it with that voice. She sighed and flipped her hair to the side, and—</p><p>She wasn’t sure because it didn’t seem like something that could’ve happened, but she could have sworn she heard Rio’s breath hitch. Which was probably just her imagining things. Because there was no way someone as young and put together would find anything about Agatha attractive. Because, let’s be realistic, Agatha did look alright, she wasn’t by any means neglecting herself, but she was also aware that she was fifty. Her foot had never stepped in a gym, and it’s only thanks to her genetics that she was still somewhat fit. And her lifestyle was undeniably readable on her face: tired eyes, fine lines, stress etched like ink. And then there was her nose. Ugh, don’t even start with Agatha on her nose. She should’ve gone through the horrors of plastic surgery when she was young, but the recovery period was making her put it off until the appeal just expired. Now, she didn’t really care that much anymore—she still disliked it, but she reasoned she was way too old for this kind of change and made peace with it. It was fine. She wasn’t looking for any kind of relationship anyway. It was just her and her job, and her job didn’t care how she looked as long as her mind was staying clear.</p><p>Her mind refused to stay clear—she couldn’t focus all day. No matter what she was doing, she kept drifting back to her meeting with Rio. The way the woman was looking at her so intently as if reading her. The way her voice carried through space was like a warm embrace. The way the corners of her lips twitched every so often after Agatha’s responses. She didn’t believe in any nonsense like soulmates or, what was even worse, love at first sight—those were Hallmark movie scripts, not real life. But there was undeniably something that was going on between her and Rio—chemistry. </p><p>“Alright, Agatha,” she heard Billy’s voice closing up through the door of their joint office space. “If you don’t need anything else, I’m going to head home a bit early tonight. Eddie and I have that thing,” he said, standing in front of her now, clutching the strap of his messenger bag. </p><p>It was a quarter to five on a Friday, and Agatha was in the middle of her weekly reports. She waved her hand off dismissively, without even glancing up from her monitor. “‘Night,” she mumbled, only partially paying attention.</p><p>She was so absorbed in her Excel file that she was sure Billy had left when his voice cut through again, startling her, “This should be you, you know.” Her eyes flicked up, sharp, one brow arching in silent question. “Going home,” he clarified, gesturing vaguely toward the outside world, “catching the pretty lady in your kitchen while she’s still there.” He was grinning—wide, boyish, irritating. Like a kid who knew he was pushing it. Agatha stared at him, unimpressed. Lord help her, she really couldn’t hit people in her employ. Her lawyer had made that painfully clear. Multiple times.</p><p>“Say hello to Eddie,” she replied coolly, clicking her tongue as she turned back to her screen.</p><p>Billy wasn’t so easily dismissed. He rocked on his heels, still grinning like an idiot. “Come on,” he said, nudging the air between them, “aren’t you at least a little curious?”</p><p>“About what?” she asked without looking up, though her voice betrayed a crack of genuine annoyance.</p><p>“About what she’s cooking.” He sounded as excited as if Rio were cooking for him.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “We discussed that in a meeting, I know exactly what she’s cooking.” Agatha had zero fucking clue what she was cooking. She’d spent the entire meeting fighting inappropriate fantasies that were attacking her shamelessly. She’d retained nothing except how fast her heart had been beating.</p><p>Billy tilted his head, eyes narrowing with the kind of smug intuition that made him infuriating. “Yeah? And what is that she’s cooking?”</p><p>She jerked her head up at him. “Go home, teen!” she snapped, jabbing her finger in his direction like she was casting a spell.</p><p>He let out an exaggerated groan, throwing his head back, “Would you <em> please </em> stop calling me that? I’m thirty years old!”</p><p>Agatha bared her teeth in a mock-snarl, eyes gleaming with threat, “Leave, or I’ll throw a shoe at you.”</p><p>Billy clutched his chest like she’d struck him, gasping dramatically, “You wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>“Wouldn’t I?” Never breaking eye contact, Agatha slowly reached down under her desk. Her fingers found the heel she’d kicked off earlier. She raised it with theatrical menace, the glint of petty vengeance in her eyes.</p><p>Billy yelped—genuinely—and bolted for the door, laughter echoing behind him as he disappeared. The door clicked shut, and Agatha allowed herself the faintest smirk.</p><p>This kid. So dramatic. She shook her head.<br/>Agatha sat there alone, the room still humming with the echo of laughter, irritation, and something else. Something <em> new. </em>For the first time in a long time, she leaned back, let out a long breath, and felt it bloom in her chest—she was looking forward to getting home. Not that she would ever admit it, of course. </p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Shortly after the clock struck ten, Agatha gave up and stopped pretending to work. Leaving the office at this hour? Outrageous. She couldn’t remember the last time that had happened—certainly not in the past decade. But tonight, her mind refused to cooperate, flitting from one useless thought to another, stubbornly resisting any attempt at productivity. And being unproductive was the worst kind of punishment for Agatha Harkness. She couldn’t keep sitting there, staring at the same line of text for the hundredth time. She had to move. Do something. Anything.</p><p>She shut down her computer, packed her gadgets with tight, mechanical precision, switched off the lights, and left. At the door, she hesitated, glancing back one last time at the office walls, as if silently begging them to keep this early departure a secret. The only good thing about working late was that, by now, the city had finally quieted. The usual chaos of rush hour had dissolved into something gentler, less demanding. No honking, no gridlock. Just a smooth, dark ribbon of road guiding her home. Agatha didn’t live far from her office, and tonight, for once, she didn’t have to detour to grab whatever sorry excuse for a meal the night streets of New York had to offer. Her routine was practically sacred: grab something vaguely edible from any nearby place still open, drag herself home, enjoy a long, hot shower, hastily eat the food, wash it down with herbal tea—adding melatonin on particularly stressful days—brush her teeth, and then collapse into bed. On a lucky occasion, she would enjoy the act of eating after a long day, but those moments were extremely rare. No, Agatha didn’t have an eating disorder; she simply wasn't a fan of food—it took far too long to decide what she wanted, even longer to obtain it, and then came the process of chewing and consuming—time she could’ve spent on something productive. Agatha loathed the way pieces of food got caught between her teeth, dreaded the time she’d have to spend flossing, and then came the whole ordeal of digestion—half of the food she engaged with would make her feel bloated and uncomfortable. Just the entire experience of that affair… Agatha was not a fan. </p><p>At a quarter to eleven, Agatha opened the door to her penthouse—and froze. Her heart kicked up, uneven, unsettled. Not panic. Not excitement, either. Something in between. A low, flickering anticipation, she didn’t know what to do with. The minute Agatha crossed the threshold, she felt it—the energy of her home felt different. Something had shifted. She focused on the feeling—it didn’t feel bad. The initial impression on her senses was the scent. While she anticipated a subtle trace of cooking, that expectation was unmet—though the smell was present, it was accompanied by something else, more distinct. The space was filled with the scent of something woody, floral, and creamy, highlighted by subtle hints of earthiness and sweetness. It felt nice, somehow making the penthouse seem warmer, cozier. It clung to the air like a hug she hadn’t asked for—but didn’t quite want to shake off. Agatha scanned the surfaces around her and spotted it almost right away—a small essential oil diffuser, tucked discreetly on a side table, steam curling from its top. She didn’t own an essential oil diffuser.</p><p>The next thing her senses picked up was the lightning. The lighting had changed, too. Softer now. Dimmed to a golden hush, the sharp fluorescent edge of her usual world dulled into something gentle, like candlelight filtered through fog. She blinked in surprise. Apparently, her penthouse lights had settings she’d never cared to discover. But her eyes didn’t ache. Her migraine, that ever-present pressure in the back of her skull, wasn’t nearly as loud. It felt nice.</p><p>There was more. As Agatha moved toward her kitchen, the sound reached her—somewhere in the background, low and unobtrusive, there was the melody of a violin. She recognized it immediately—Vivaldi. Crisp strings, sharp turns, delicate footfalls of melody dancing across her skin. She had to admit, everything about the past couple of minutes felt a little surreal—it was her home, but somehow it felt like it belonged to someone else. As if she stole a glance at an alternative reality where she lived another version of her life—warm, domestic, and full of love. Agatha swallowed hard, forcing her trembling limbs to carry her forward.</p><p>Upon entering the kitchen, she noticed that the dining area, which she had never used since acquiring the penthouse, was tidied up, with a small round table set for dinner. Fine china she had forgotten she possessed adorned the tabletop, accompanied by two unlit candles and a matchbox on the side. A small teapot rested on a tripod with a tealight underneath. Agatha did not own a teapot. She kept scanning the surface when her eyes caught it—a handwritten note. Agatha picked it up in a daze.</p><p>
<em> Agatha, </em>
</p><p><em> Please forgive me for the intrusion. I took the liberty of adding several objects to your home to help create a pleasant experience, yet if </em> <em> you feel it's too much just leave them by the front door for me to collect later. </em> <em> You mentioned during our meeting that you don’t drink alcohol and prefer tea to any other beverage. Please accept this tea as a token of appreciation and an introduction to our hopefully future journey together. These herbs are from my personal greenhouse, so you won’t find anything “cleaner” than that. On the house. </em></p><p>
<em> You must have noticed the oil diffuser. I wasn’t sure if you owned one; it turned out you didn’t. I find the scent of sandalwood comforting, and prefer to be surrounded by it when I cook. I thought that perhaps you could use some comfort, too. On the house. </em>
</p><p><em> Now, let’s review your menu for tonight, shall we? You mentioned that you preferred simple meals </em> —something <em> “comfy”. I hope you enjoy this pasta bolognese with lean beef meatballs. There is some aged parmesan with grapes under the cover next to this note, because who doesn’t like parmesan? You also mentioned that you were not a fan of vegetables and preferred to get your vitamins and fiber from the Greens’ supplements, which is totally fine. However, I took the liberty of seizing this opportunity to offer you my signature creamy broccoli with spinach. Please try not to judge a book by its cover and give it a chance. I promise, the sauce makes it taste out of this world; you won’t even notice you’re eating vegetables. If you still don’t like it, the next three desserts are on me. </em></p><p>
<em> Enjoy your meal and evening (or is it already considered night by the time you read this note?). </em>
</p><p>
<em> Feel free to submit your feedback or any special requests. </em>
</p><p>—<em> Rio. </em></p><p>And there they were, at the foot of the note, a sequence of digits—Rio’s phone number. Agatha blinked. Shook her head a little. Blinked again. She kept staring at the note as if it’d grown limbs. What was that? Yes, Rio did make an impression of a genuinely nice person, but, seriously… who did things like that? When Agatha first started reading the note, she dismissed all these things as part of the service, but it became clearer the deeper she went that Rio had done some extra preparations specifically for her. <em> On the house </em>. Agatha’s mind short-circuited. She had no idea what to do with this information. Something in her chest ached. Not in a painful way. Just tight. Fragile. Like an old wound suddenly remembering how to feel.</p><p>She didn’t know how long she sat there, holding that note in one hand, her eyes unfocused. She just… breathed. The scent of sandalwood was filling her lungs. She exhaled, inhaled again. And again, allowing the comforting aroma to hug her from within. Rio was right, it did the job.</p><p>Agatha spent some time simply breathing, letting the setting Rio’d set to soothe her frayed nerves. She reasoned then that she didn’t have to react to the note or its contents immediately. She had time. Rio wasn’t going to return until four o’clock tomorrow—that is, if Agatha decided to keep the service. And it was Saturday, so Agatha could linger at home a bit longer in the morning before she went to the office. Because, yes, she did work on the weekends—her schedule was just more relaxing and casual. No meetings, just Agatha catching up on things she missed during a busy week.</p><p>After a long, hot shower, she padded into the kitchen, barefoot and wrapped in her robe, feeling the aroma of a now-warm meal fill her senses. She had to admit, it smelled amazing. And that came from someone who was not a fan of food, so it meant something. And as someone who was not a fan of food, Agatha didn’t know what she’d expected—probably to feel nothing as usual—maybe enjoy it just a little since it was a real home-cooked meal with all the ingredients made by hand. A few bites—a polite appreciation.What she didn’t expect was to moan—an honest-to-gods, <em> what the fuck was that </em>, soul-leaving-her-body moan—at her first bite of pasta. Her eyes snapped wide. She looked around, half-paranoid, cheeks flushed. She was extremely glad she lived alone, and her smart-house assistant was always offline because the sound that came from her was pathetic—vulnerable and weak. Seriously, what the fuck? How can you make something as simple as pasta taste this good? Agatha took another bite to make sure she hadn’t imagined that. She hadn’t. She narrowed her eyes in the direction of the vegetables. If pasta tasted this good, there was a high chance Rio wasn’t lying about broccoli. Here comes nothing. Agatha forked a tiny, green tree and closed her eyes tightly in anticipation like a woman about to face a firing squad. She received a punch—Agatha mentally punched herself for doubting Rio, believing that those vegetables couldn’t taste like non-vegetables. The goddamn vegatables didn’t taste like vegatables at all! Agatha was experiencing a severe cognitive dissonance. </p><p>She was one-third of the way into her meal when she realized something even more shocking—she was chewing slowly, fully focused on the food. There was no phone with more work in hand, no background noise of the news on TV, no wandering thoughts, and no rush to shove the meal down her throat as fast as possible just to be done with it. She was genuinely enjoying this meal, savoring it. She finished it all—the pasta, cheese-n-grapes treat, and even the vegetables. She actually enjoyed the vegetables. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>There were few things that could surprise Agatha anymore, let alone shock. She was definitely shocked now. Agatha Harkness, the sharp-tongued piranha, the destroyer of negative rumors, the nightmare of paparazzi and clickbait journalists, had been defeated. By dinner. What kind of sorcery was this? Was Rio secretly a witch? Had she enchanted the meal?</p><p>She was drinking her tea, rereading the note again and again. She felt a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. All of that should be alarming and concern her, but instead, for the first time in a long while, Agatha felt at peace—warm, satisfied, comfortable, and safe.</p><p>She saved Rio’s phone number in her phone and went to bed. And when she finally laid her head down, she fell asleep instantly—no melatonin required. </p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Agatha woke slowly to the kind of quiet that felt almost accusatory, as if the absence of her never-ending migraine were somehow a personal attack. For a long moment, she lay perfectly still in the warmth of her bed, unsure of what had gone wrong and deeply suspicious of how right everything felt. There was no pounding in her temples, no grit behind her eyelids, no dull ache in her jaw from grinding her teeth through half-formed and already half-forgotten nightmares or unspoken arguments with clients or ghosts of her own making; there was only a strange softness to her limbs, a looseness in her spine that unnerved her more than any pain ever could.</p><p>She opened her eyes slowly and cautiously, squinting at the flickering street lamps still lit at five in the morning. Her mind immediately began forming a mental list of tasks to tackle today—problems to solve, fires to put out. This wasn’t just a habit for Agatha; it was her second nature. Yet today felt different. She realized she was met with a deeply disturbing nothingness. Her usually anxious mind, always pressed by some invisible deadline, was calm as if acknowledging that there was no crisis demanding her attention before she could even wash her face. The silence stretched on, and it unsettled her, not because it was empty, but because it was unfamiliar, unearned, almost indulgent, like something fragile and precious had crept into her life when she wasn’t looking, and now she was afraid to move too suddenly in case it shattered.</p><p>She sat up slowly, the sheets falling away from her shoulders, and frowned at the strange sensation of being rested—not the jangled, desperate kind of alertness that came from three hours of shallow sleep followed by three shots of espresso, but the disorienting clarity of actually having slept through the night, uninterrupted, without cold sweats or clenching her fists in her dreams she could never recall, and that more than anything made her stomach twist. Because rest was not neutral. Rest was a warning. Rest meant vulnerability, meant she had let her guard down, had allowed some unknown variable into her rigidly controlled system, and the only new factor in the past twenty-four hours—her mind zeroed in on it instantly, cold and sharp was—</p><p>The diffuser. The lighting. The tea. The handwritten, infuriatingly charming note. The meal that had been, in a word, devastating. The only new factor in the past twenty-four hours was <em> Rio. </em></p><p>She pressed a hand to her forehead, like she was checking for fever, for madness, for divine interference, and scowled at the memory of the broccoli—goddamn broccoli—melting in her mouth like it had no business being that good, like it had some secret agenda she hadn’t been warned about. She hadn’t just eaten it. She’d <em> enjoyed </em> it. She’d gone to bed with the warm embrace of sandalwood, pleasant aftertaste of tea, and satisfaction still lingering in her bones, and now she was waking up in a cocoon of peace she absolutely, categorically did not trust.</p><p>Sliding out of bed felt like stepping out of a dream, or worse—out of someone else’s body, someone less prepared, less guarded, less like <em> her </em> , and as her feet touched the cold floor she braced herself for the inevitable throb of exhaustion, the weight of too many expectations waiting to crush her spine back into its usual shape—but it didn’t come. Instead, the silence greeted her again, like an old friend she’d forgotten how to speak to, and that made it worse, because the question loomed louder than anything else: <em> What the fuck did she do to me? </em></p><p>Not in a literal sense. Not like poison or mind control or magic—no. This was worse. This was subtle. This was kindness with no strings attached. This was care wrapped in creamy cheese sauce and green leafy deception. And Agatha didn’t know what to do with that. </p><p>She made it to the bathroom, splashed cold water on her face, stared into her reflection like it might offer answers, and watched herself scowl at nothing in particular, because nothing in particular was the problem. Her world had shifted, just a little, just enough to be felt but not enough to be explained—and that was where the danger lived. Her first impulse was the need to get ahead of this, to reassert control. She took a deep breath, ready to start planning her strategy, but her mind wasn’t cooperating. Instead, it came to a halt as if something got caught between the gears, basically screaming at her to take a step back and reevaluate the position she found herself in. Agatha frowned and tried focusing on her sensations. She noticed that she actually was not that opposed to feeling like an alive human being, full of energy. And if she put her mental habits aside, that sense of calmness actually felt quite nice. She lazily looked around, taking in the details of her penthouse, zeroing in on its energy flow—it felt different with someone having been worked around it. It felt nice—lived in—not just a shallow box Agatha was using to get, what she dared to call, sleep. She caught sight of the note still resting on the table. Rio’s handwriting—looping and warm, unlike Agatha’s chicken scratch with sharp edges. </p><p>The main reason for hiring a service was to help her take better care of herself. However, Agatha didn’t consider the implications beyond the initial hiring. Deep down, she hoped it would fail, allowing her to rub it into Jen’s face and dismiss any future similar suggestions. She was unprepared for any positive outcome and hadn't thought about any further steps. She had hired a service and now needed another service to help her navigate everything she was feeling. That whole affair ought to have included a manual. <em> On the house. </em> Agatha wanted to scream. She groaned instead, loud and long, and thunked her head gently against the bathroom mirror.</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The meal itself was exquisite. The salmon melted on her tongue like a secret whispered in the dark. The potatoes brought warmth to her stomach that made her want to close her eyes and curl up under it like a thick, feather blanket. And the asparagus—goddamn asparagus—had clearly graduated from the same school as broccoli, majoring in betrayal. And the fruit tarts…<br/>She took one bite, and her eyes almost teared up. They were perfect. Too perfect. They tasted like something someone would make for a person they cared about. Not a client. Not an employer. Someone whose happiness mattered.<br/>She blinked hard and stared down at her plate, jaw clenched. She wanted this. Every night. This quiet gentleness. This unspoken knowing. This feeling of being seen without having to ask. If only there were a way to tell Rio that.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first thing Agatha did after restocking caffeine level in her bloodstream was email Lilia Calderu. Yes, Agatha saved Rio’s number. No, Agatha was not going to text her. That seemed rather unprofessional, inappropriate even. Intimate. In a moment of weakness, she considered writing a reply note on the back of Rio’s, folding it carefully, and placing it where she’d left the dishes. But it was only a moment—an indulgent, reckless, dangerous moment. Common sense had taken over just in time, yanking her back from the precipice before she could do something reckless and unhinged. Something emotional. Something she would definitely regret later.</p><p>Agatha was proud to say she functioned well under stress. No matter how deeply things unravelled behind the scenes, she could always maintain the façade. She had learned that the key, in situations like this, was to stick to the routine, not to stray from the previously set plan, not to allow yourself to succumb to emotions, and not to be compulsive. She always knew what she needed to do; the rest was irrelevant. Her feelings? Irrelevant. Her desires? Unnecessary. The plan? The plan was sacred. The plan was survival. And right now, the plan was to keep the service and submit her feedback in the most professional way possible. She couldn’t afford detours. Detours led to emotional wreckage. Detours were for people who had the luxury of falling apart.</p><p>Agatha liked emails—emails were her jam. She could compose the entire two-day seminar in the body of a single email, providing all necessary information in the most explanatory way for the recipient while still maintaining charm, warmth, and unwavering control. Her emails had won her hundreds of customers throughout the years. Emails were where she excelled. Emails were safe. Emails were her comfort zone.</p><p>She informed the service that the experience had been proper, and she was willing to keep the dinner program going. She was prompt and polite. No unnecessary additional information. No further requests. Just plain confirmation of the service. Thank you very much, and have a pleasant day.</p><p>Agatha was not delusional. Normally, she was capable of acknowledging an issue and working towards neutralizing it. Or, if it wasn’t possible to neutralize it right away, she would at least ensure it didn’t cause any negative, lasting effect on her perfectly structured equilibrium. Rio Vidal was not an issue. The chef was clearly competent, professional, and charming in that quiet, devastating way—soft-spoken, yes, but disarmingly direct, as if she saw through every defense Agatha had ever built and chose, gently, not to tear them down. Agatha’s feelings were the issue. She was painfully aware she was attracted to Rio in more ways than just physical. Physical was easy, it didn’t pose a problem—lust was natural, it was biology, and one couldn’t help it. It came and went. In Agatha’s book, it didn’t really mean that much. It was impersonal. Nothing to panic over. </p><p>She’d had her fair share of flings over the years—not too many to be judged, but not few enough to be pitied. Frankly, she didn’t even notice when her sex life faded into the background. When she was younger, sex had never had much appeal, but that was because, as she later discovered, she was gay. It changed after she came out. The realization that being with women like that was a possibility came along with new desires, and, naturally, Agatha dove headlong into discovering them. It was thrilling—sex finally felt good. Yet, months went by and the novelty had worn off, leaving a routine, messy affair with a lingering aftertaste of loneliness—Agatha could not connect with anyone she’d been sleeping with, she just… didn’t click with those people. It all felt like pretending—like reaching through glass for someone who was never really there. Then Nicky passed away, and the disappointment of yet another unfit relationship was suddenly the last thing on her list of things to agonize about.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, she crossed paths with Wanda. Charming. Magnetic. Passionate in a way that made Agatha feel something again after years of grieving. She didn’t see the cracks at first. Or maybe she did, but she didn’t care—she just wanted to feel something that wasn’t the bitter aftertaste of grief. She wanted to be chosen. But Wanda… Wanda hadn’t wanted Agatha, not really. She’d wanted a version of her—a curated, softened, palatable version. They were together not for long—Agatha spotted the patterns quickly and ended their relationship. Wanda wasn’t a bad person, per se; they were just incompatible. Agatha wanted to grow, to rebuild her life, and gain total independence. She wanted to pursue her career, to spend more time with her clients, building relationships and network, while Wanda wanted to be one of those cliché couples who did everything together. She wanted a partner in domesticity—lazy mornings and joint vacations—learning each other and the world around them. Agatha couldn’t say she didn’t want those things, but she didn’t want those things at that particular period. In that particular period, she wanted to conquer the world; she didn’t want to feel like she had to shrink herself to fit into a two-bedroom dream.</p><p>They’d barely settled into their new test-drive living together trial before the fighting started. And Agatha was quite pleased with herself for suggesting they test those new dynamics first before officially moving in together. Because they were fighting every night without fail, when Agatha would finally drag herself across their threshold at one in the morning. After a month of pointless arguments, she had to conclude that yet another relationship is not going to work. It wasn’t even dramatic. Just sad. Quiet. Like snuffing out a candle that had never been lit properly in the first place. She knew if she asked Wanda to wait, she wouldn’t have waited. Which was for the better—if Agatha were completely honest, there was never that spark between them. As usual, it wasn’t clicking despite how much Agatha wanted it to. Love couldn’t be forced, they said.</p><p>It didn’t mean it didn’t hurt her deeply—to open up to someone after what she’s gone through, only to be met with… how could she even describe that? Politeness? Platitudes? Agatha was unsure whether it was her and her perspective of the world, or just other people being unintentionally annoying. When she would finally share something personal with someone, that clearly had an impact on her and meant a lot, the last thing she needed was for the other person to offer a cliché “this is going to be okay,” or “no, you’re not broken, I don’t see you like that,” or “I’m sorry you feel this way, it is valid and I understand” or something of that nature.</p><p>Those—were clichés. Agatha despised clichés. It was like people were incapable of expressing themselves, using pre-approved social lines instead—a lazy approach. She didn’t want someone who responded to her deepest scars with rehearsed, scripted empathy. Wanda had been full of clichés and full of subtle manipulation. Agatha didn’t even know if she was doing it on purpose—she wanted to believe she wasn’t. But her gut still twisted at the thought. In the end, it didn’t matter. It was another relationship that didn’t break her. Another almost that ended in nothing.</p><p>But Agatha never let herself leave empty-handed. Every failure was fuel. She hardened. She learned. She adapted. Love was unreliable. But power? Power was consistent. Achievements didn’t wake you in the middle of the night and ask if you still loved them. Goals didn’t leave. She stopped getting carried away. Stopped reaching. Relationships were overrated. She was fine. She was thriving.</p><p>How long had it been since Wanda? Twelve—no, fifteen years, maybe more. She stopped counting. What she <em> did </em> count were the contracts signed, the heads turned around, the accolades earned—her empire being built stone by stone. Her life was her own.</p><p>And that’s why now, her feelings were an issue. Feelings were distracting—dangerous. Physical Agatha could handle. Lust was irrelevant—it always passed eventually. But being attracted to someone… not <em> just </em> someone in this very case—an open person who was kind to her, while she couldn’t even be kind to herself… <em> that </em> was dangerous. And Rio Vidal was dangerous. Not because she had done anything wrong. But because her voice was soft, and her smile warm. She saw Agatha looking at her and didn’t look away. And Agatha didn’t know what to do with that kindness. Not when it was real. Not when it was offered to her like it was as easy as breathing. Not when she might want to take and keep it.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to focus on her tasks at hand and take full advantage of the quiet Saturday office. She could <em> not-think </em> about Rio later; she wasn’t going anywhere now that she had decided to keep the service. Agatha was glad Billy wasn’t coming in on the weekends because there was no way in hell that boy would’ve missed the storm gathering behind her composed expression, the subtle tells she could normally suppress with ease. It was becoming more and more challenging lately. Focus. Keep the mouse moving. She wasn’t delusional; she was perfectly aware that she was going through <em> something </em>, and that the whole situation she found herself in was affecting her far more than it should have. Far more than she wanted it to. But fine. Fine. That didn’t mean she couldn’t work through it. Suppress it. Dissect it with logic and precision and file it into the correct internal cabinet. She’d done it before.</p><p>When she got back home that evening, it wasn’t as overwhelming as the night before. She already knew what to expect—or so she thought. The setting was similar—the subtle scent of sandalwood lingering in the background like a memory just out of reach, the lights dimmed to a low, golden hue, and soft music curling through the air—jazz tonight, slow and smooth, just the way she liked it.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway. Was it just…coincidence? Or had someone told Rio? Had Billy provided Lilia with some additional information, or had Rio just… guessed? Precisely? <em> Twice in a row? </em> Her chest squeezed around the thought, and she brushed it away like a cobweb. She went to the bathroom immediately, determined to avoid the rising anticipation in her chest. She would <em> not </em> look at the table. She would <em> not </em> check for a note. If there was one, it could wait. If there wasn’t… well. Then that would be better, wouldn’t it? She paused to consider and realized that it would leave her feeling disappointed. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>Her shower was boiling hot and long as always, the water beating down on her scalp in thick, steady threads. Normally, Agatha would think of nothing in particular, standing under the stream. This was her sacred time. Her blank, liminal space. She had trained herself to switch off her mind, to feel the water without letting it wander too far in any direction, and to let it wash away the day with all its struggles and triumphs. But lately, her mind and her body had been conspiring against her, like traitors. Little rebels in the dark, stirring inconvenient needs. Now, all she could think about was the meal waiting in the oven. The warmth of it. The care behind it. And worse—what it would feel like to come home to a served table every night. With someone waiting for her. Someone who knew her taste in tea and music. Someone who thought to make an extra effort just because she might enjoy it.</p><p>That was an inappropriate train of thought. Agatha clenched her jaw. That was fantasy—a dangerous one. There <em> was </em> no one. There was no shared home. No gentle voice waiting to ask her how her day had been. And she should not indulge in such fantasies, self-sabotaging, and giving her soul any false hope. But what if—</p><p><em> No </em> . She told the small voice inside her head. No. She snapped the thought in half like a brittle stick and tossed it into the void. Rio was just doing her job, she was a nice person in general. And even if she was in fact doing a little extra because she, by some miracle, liked Agatha​​ beyond professional obligation, that still didn’t change the reality of the arrangement, and was still a massive no. Because Agatha was <em> paying </em> her. She was paying <em> her </em> . And Agatha Harkness did not pay for intimacy. <em> So, there, voice. Do you have any more questions? </em> She waited. The voice didn’t try again. <em>Good</em>.</p><p>She emerged from the steam feeling taut and sharp, like a blade fresh from quenching. Her hair was still damp as she moved toward the kitchen, stomach knotted. The back of her head was throbbing now, an ache of restlessness and something else—<em> hope, </em> maybe. A hope she refused to name. She opened the oven and inspected the dish. Smoked salmon, small potatoes, and asparagus under the same sauce Rio had used for the broccoli. Her heart clenched at the memory of that broccoli, the quiet betrayal of it being <em> good </em>, against all odds. She hit the buttons to warm it up, pulse quickening—she needed to see what lay on the table. When Agatha finally turned, she felt the corners of her mouth twitch—the note was there—In the same place in the middle of the plate. Agatha sat at the table and reached for it with slightly trembling fingers.</p><p>
<em> Agatha, </em>
</p><p>
<em> Do you have anything against direct communication? (I am not trying to sound judgmental, just so you know. I am actually smiling right now.) Glad to hear my efforts were… proper. Dare I assume you liked the additions as well? You haven’t returned them, so I would like to believe you are enjoying those small, extra touches. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Your tea is a little different tonight. I’m going to experiment a little to give you a chance to try different blends and decide which one you like the most. Who knows, perhaps one day, you will share your feedback. And if not… I will just keep trying until I find the one that leaves you with something to say. On the house. </em>
</p><p>
<em> There is a treat for you under the cover next to this note. It is the weekend, and apparently you still went into work as it is a little after seven now, and you’re still not here. So, I took the liberty of assuming you would like something pleasant after working non-stop yet another day. These fruit tarts are my favorite—they are low calorie, don’t have any sugar, butter, or eggs, meaning you can have several without overthinking it. Give it a try? On the house. </em>
</p><p>
<em> As you have probably already seen, I included some asparagus in your meal tonight. Well, you never told me what you thought of the broccoli, making me automatically assume that you enjoyed it. See, you would have to communicate to cancel the vegetables, such are the rules. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Enjoy your meal and night. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You know what to do if you have any special requests. </em>
</p><p>—<em> Rio. </em></p><p>This… felt different, less rehearsed somehow, more friendly, open, maybe a little teasing. There was a warmth to it that twisted like a knife in Agatha’s gut, and she hated how easily she read between the lines. How Rio managed to make every word sound like an inside joke just for her. A wink across a dimly lit room. An invitation. And what was that about emphasizing that Agatha wasn't home after seven? Had Rio been waiting for her? Did she expect to see her tonight? Because it shouldn't have taken her three hours to prepare a meal, should it?</p><p>She reached for the cover and lifted it, revealing three fruit tarts. Agatha froze, staring at them. They weren’t perfect. They were <em> imperfect </em>in a spontaneous way—uneven, with jello slightly dripping down the sides, just a little messy, just a little raw. Like they’d been made last-minute, not rushed exactly, but unplanned. Unpolished. Her throat closed. The fact that Rio hadn’t corrected the imperfections—that she’d left these as they were—that did something to Agatha she couldn’t explain. They smelled amazing. Sweet and fresh and real. How do you make something sweet without sugar? Agatha wished she could ask Rio. How do you make something this thoughtful without knowing a person? Agatha wished she could ask someone.</p><p>The meal itself was exquisite. The salmon melted on her tongue like a secret whispered in the dark. The potatoes brought warmth to her stomach that made her want to close her eyes and curl up under it like a thick, feather blanket. And the asparagus—goddamn asparagus—had clearly graduated from the same school as broccoli, majoring in betrayal. And the fruit tarts…</p><p>She took one bite, and her eyes almost teared up. They were perfect. Too perfect. They tasted like something someone would make for a person they cared about. Not a client. Not an employer. Someone whose happiness mattered.</p><p>She blinked hard and stared down at her plate, jaw clenched. She wanted this. Every night. This quiet gentleness. This unspoken knowing. This feeling of being seen without having to ask<em> . </em>If only there were a way to tell Rio that.</p><p>She picked up the note again. Read it twice. Let it burn in her palm like something sacred.</p><p>Silently and appearing far calmer than she felt, Agatha finished her dinner, washed the dishes, brushed her teeth, and went to bed. She did not write a reply on the other side of the note. She did not text Rio.</p><p>It turned into a routine after that—quietly, easily, like breath. Agatha would return to the newfound warmth of her home every night, stepping into a curated dreamscape of dimmed lights, low music, and some impossible scent drifting through the air like memory. The food was always divine—sensory-orgasmic, unfairly perfect, designed to break down walls one bite at a time. There would always be a new tea blend, subtle and strange and comforting in ways Agatha couldn’t name. There would always be some small treat, something thoughtful and unnecessary, something that somehow knew exactly what kind of day she’d had. And there would always be a note.</p><p>Agatha didn’t realize how much she had come to rely on the notes until she caught herself anticipating them. Not just the food, though that, too, was becoming a kind of emotional sedative, but the quiet ritual of holding that square of paper, of tracing the words with her eyes as if they were meant only for her. She told herself it was indulgence, just another sensory delight after a long day.</p><p>Agatha never replied to the notes.</p><p>She read them, of course. Carefully. Greedily. Often three times. But she never wrote back. Not once. Not even a <em> thank you </em> . Which, apparently, wasn’t stopping Rio. On the contrary—her notes had grown longer, warmer, more teasing. Agatha noticed how it evolved over time, grew more knowing, and laced more care into every line. Rio never asked for anything. She offered. She noticed. She remembered. She adjusted. It was a little devastating because Agatha wasn’t used to kindness without an agenda. There was an irreverent intimacy in the notes, a kind of soft audacity—as if Rio could <em> feel </em> her, feel Agatha responding despite pretending to be immune. As if Rio knew she was being read, and smiled at the knowledge. As if she were writing not to elicit a response but to keep Agatha company, to leave a trace of herself in Agatha’s space and say, <em> I’m staying anyway, for as long as you keep me.  </em></p><p>It wasn’t quite flirting. It was something quieter, something gentler—care dressed in mischief, affection with plausible deniability. Agatha had no idea what it was. But it felt nice. Rio felt nice. And Agatha, who had spent years wrapped in armor and strategy, who understood every shade of manipulation and pragmatic planning—that Agatha let herself enjoy it. Because as long as she didn’t write back, it was safe. Harmless. A kindness she could absorb without risking anything in return. She told herself that. Every night. That it was nothing. Just words on a page. Just a kind person being nice. And every night she would sit a little longer at the table, fingers brushing the edge of the note, heart beating too fast over tea.</p><p>It was a Wednesday. Late, cold, and raining in a way that made the whole world feel distant. Agatha had been spiraling all day, stuck in her head, too sharp, too tired, too <em> everything </em>. She’d snapped at Billy for something meaningless. She hadn’t eaten lunch. She hadn’t spoken a single kind word to herself. It was one of those days.</p><p>When she stepped into her apartment, the scent of honey and cardamom met her at the door. There was no music playing tonight. Just quiet. She could tell immediately that tonight’s tea would be sweeter. Softer. There was something deeply tender in the air, like Rio had <em> known </em>. Like she’d read the exhaustion in the silence between them and adjusted accordingly.</p><p>The meal was simple—something gentle on the stomach, nothing rich or overwhelming. And the note was shorter tonight. It was resting on the plate again, folded neatly as always, but there was something else tucked underneath—a small USB drive. Agatha frowned, reaching for the note.</p><p>
<em> Dear Agatha, </em>
</p><p>
<em> I think I could feel your restless energy all the way across town today. You feel like you could use a little quiet. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I played something for you. It’s an old piece—I learned it for someone I lost, long ago. It’s quiet. Gentle.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hope this makes you feel a little less alone. It’s not perfect. But it’s yours tonight… and any other night when you need it. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Take care of yourself. Please. </em>
</p><p>
<em> —R </em>
</p><p>Agatha stared at the note for a long time, fingers tightening around her mug. <em> Dear Agatha. </em> She kept rereading it again and again and again. The lump in her throat came out of nowhere. She didn’t cry. She wouldn’t let herself. But her chest ached with something she couldn't quite put into words..</p><p>She stared at the USB drive that somehow felt heavier than anything else in the room. Without waiting to overthink it, she carried it to her laptop and plugged it in. There was only one file. No title. Just the time and date—today’s date, at 3:33 pm—right before Rio was supposed to leave for Agatha’s. She swallowed hard and clicked play.</p><p>Soft piano flooded the space—hesitant at first, almost shy, then blooming slowly into something rich, tender, aching. It wasn’t showy. It wasn’t polished like the music she typically listened to. It sounded real, alive. It sounded raw and passionate. Like someone who was silently screaming to deliver a message. Like someone who cared deeply. Like someone who was aching to help.</p><p>She sat very still. Let the notes wash over her. Her chest cracked open a little more with every tone. Her hands were trembling, and her heart was beating in sync with the melody. No one had ever played for her before.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around nothing. She took a shallow breath and went to the kitchen, reaching for the junk drawer and grabbing a pen. She sat back at the table, flipped the note, and stared at the blank paper. The tension was thick. The storm outside thrashed against the windows, as if echoing her heartbeat and the piano in her speaker. Her fingers hovered over the paper. The pen almost touching down—one line, one word, and she’d cross this boundary.</p><p>A thousand phrases flitted through her head—</p><p><em> Thank you. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> You didn’t have to. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> How did you know? </em> <em><br/></em> <em> It’s helping. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> I’m not okay. </em> <em><br/></em> <em> Please don’t stop. </em></p><p>—but in the end… she capped the pen, folded the note, and put it aside.  She pulled up her knee, wrapping her arm around it, and rested her chin on top, letting the song play again. And again. And again. Later, after she’d moved to bed, she left her laptop open on the nightstand and pressed play one more time. Just to fall asleep with it. Just to pretend, for a moment, that someone was still there. That someone cared enough to fill her silence with music.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, Agatha remembered her dreams. She dreamt of delicate hands with long fingers on piano keys. Gentle. Steady. Waiting for her.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>It had been an extremely stressful week. Not just one, but two of Agatha’s clients dragged their names into a scandal, and she was extinguishing fires back to back—a PR nightmare. She was barely sleeping again, and the only thing that had kept her going was the anticipation of coming home to Rio’s notes. It was ridiculous. She didn’t even <em> answer </em> them. And yet she would reread them like a schoolgirl. Several times. Sometimes she would catch herself smiling like a fucking idiot while eating, her eyes darting to the kitchen like she could still feel Rio’s warmth in the air. It was all getting deeply out of hand.</p><p>It had been a particularly cold winter in New York, so it really didn’t come as a surprise to Agatha when she woke up today and couldn’t open her eyes. Her head was throbbing, her chest so congested that she could barely breathe, and she was burning up. Great. Fever. She’s been so good to her system for the past three weeks; she was getting at least four hours of actually restful sleep every night, and she was eating a hot, nutritious meal with actual vegetables every night. Yes, she was still a mess during the day, but she’s been improving. She had made the effort. She had <em> tried </em>. And now her body betrayed her, as if it had been waiting to strike the moment she allowed herself to fall back into her old habits, not even intentionally this time, but as a result of circumstances.</p><p>She groaned, annoyed, dragging herself out of bed and stumbling toward the medicine cabinet. Some Tylenol PM, washed with NyQuil, and a hot cup of honey tea—everything she had the strength for. She settled on the couch, wrapped in a large, plush blanket, tea warming her palms. She squinted at her phone screen, the light was too bright and was making her sick, so she shot a quick message to Billy. <em> Not coming in. Reschedule calendar. </em> She had just enough strength left to hit that <em> Send </em> button before she dropped her phone somewhere and passed out under the effect of medicine and tea.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long she had been out. She couldn’t comprehend what had awoken her at first. Her mind was fuzzy; she felt like her head was wrapped in a pillowcase full of packing peanuts. Her limbs felt weak and heavy at the same time, and she was still struggling to breathe. She attempted to concentrate on the sounds: the jingling keys, distant shuffling, faint music as if coming from headphones, and soft humming. The humming. She knew that voice. That was Rio’s voice. <em> Oh no. No no no no no. </em></p><p>A bolt of panic jolted through her like wildfire, and if she had any strength in her body, she would’ve jumped into action. <em> Son of a bitch </em> , her stupid fryed brain forgot to cancel Rio! <em> Fuck! Shit! </em> What were the chances that Rio would not notice a human-sized blanket burrito on the couch in the middle of an adjoining living room and kitchen? Pretty high, right? <em> Fuck.  </em></p><p>She curled tighter under the blanket, her head covered too, so she couldn’t see anything, only listen, holding her breath. First, she heard the footsteps and shuffling stop. Something dropped on the floor, likely a grocery bag. Then, the music was shut down. Footsteps again. Voice. Rio’s voice was very close now; she was undoubtedly right next to the couch.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was warm yet tinged with confusion and something else—something concerned and tender.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut and, without pulling her head from under the blanket, mumbled, “Sorry, I forgot to cancel, you should go home.” None of the words she said sounded articulate, as apparently she was sicker than she thought she was, and the congestion was making her incoherent. She heard Rio’s breath hitch.</p><p>“Does anyone know you’re sick?” Rio was moving, and Agatha felt the couch dip as she sat down right beside her burrito form.</p><p>“I’m fine, just need to be horizontal for a bit,” she insisted weakly. A lie so transparent it didn’t deserve breath. Suddenly, she felt a tug on the blanket. She instinctively clutched it and protectively jerked it back, covering more of her head. She heard Rio chuckle.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said it like a warning, yet she was obviously smiling. Agatha sighed, defeated. Fine, whatever. If she wanted to see her at her lowest—a complete mess—so be it. That would mark the end of the illusion. The non-flirting over one-sided notes was nice while it lasted. She should have really appreciated that time more. She felt a little bitter now, knowing that it was going to end. “What you need,” Rio’s voice cut through her sulking, tugging at the blanket again, and slowly revealing her overheated head, “is a comfortable bed to rest in properly, Vicks all over your chest, a cold compress on your head, and chicken soup.” She tugged a little more, and Agatha finally let the blanket slip from her burning with fever and embarrassment face. She braced herself for disgust at the state she was currently in.</p><p>But Rio was smiling at her affectionately. <em> Wait… </em> she was smiling? Why was she smiling? Agatha didn’t need to look in the mirror to know that she looked absolutely horrific. “Hi,” Rio said in that gentle voice of hers, and before Agatha could process it, she continued, “I’m going to pick you up now.” <em> Wait, what?!  </em></p><p>Adrenaline surged in her veins, and before Rio could reach her, Agatha stopped her with the palm placed between them. “Stay away, you’re gonna get sick, too!”</p><p>Rio smirked. She <em> fucking </em> smirked. What was wrong with this woman? “So, you’re admitting, you’re sick?” <em> Oh </em>. </p><p>She opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again. “I’m fine, really,” she wheezed, sounding like a dying pterodactyl. Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, “Agatha.” That warning tone again. And maybe it was the fever, but Agatha thought it was hot. She looked up. At last, Rio added, “Shut up.” <em> Hot </em>. Not waiting for a reaction, she moved closer and scooped Agatha up with one arm under her knees, and the other wrapped around her middle. She picked her up and stood so effortlessly as if Agatha weighed nothing. Her arms instinctively flew over Rio’s shoulders for balance, and she felt her grip on her weak body tighten.</p><p>Rio placed her on the bed with so much care it felt devotional, and Agatha didn’t know how to process. It felt like she was selling something of little value, being offered a hundred-dollar bill, and she didn’t have that kind of change. She didn’t have any change. Agatha wanted to scream. That’s when she noticed what Rio had been wearing—a muscle tee. One of those gym excuses for a cover, with sleeves cut off so deep you could see the entire torso. She gulped. Rio had muscles—well defined shoulders, and fucking biceps. Agatha <em> needed </em> to scream.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long she had been lost in her lust-infused, fevered stupor; the next thing she registered was the freezing weight of a makeshift ice compress on her forehead and the scent of Vicks in the air. She blinked herself into awareness and looked at Rio suspiciously.</p><p>“I would need to move your shirt out of the way,” she said, softer now. Agatha could only nod her head, dumbly, too far gone to form words. She was struggling to process what was happening. She expected her to lift it up or tug the collar down. What she didn’t expect was for Rio to pinch the fabric with one hand, lift it off her body, and slide her other hand underneath it, spreading her Vicks-covered fingers over her chest. And did Agatha mention she wasn’t wearing a bra? Because why would she? She was sick at home. She froze.</p><p>“Breathe,” Rio’s voice was the gentlest of touches on Agatha’s soul. Agatha tried. She really did. But her lungs didn’t know how to be lungs anymore. Her whole body felt like it was made of sparks. She must have looked absolutely terrified because the next thing she knew, Rio started talking. “Do you want to hear about a puppy I saw on my way here?” Agatha couldn’t look at her, but she heard the smile in her voice. Her fingers were slowly working on rubbing the ointment into her skin. Agatha knew somehow that Rio’s gaze was locked on her face. “He was the chonkiest little fella I’ve ever seen. And he was trying to chase a ball, but his legs were too short, and his tummy was too round, so he tripped over himself and fell on his side.” She felt herself slowly relaxing. The stupid story was surprisingly helping. “And then he tried to get up, but he couldn’t. So, he was just rolling there like a cheese ball in melted butter. By the time I was close enough to help him, he’d already tired himself out and was sound asleep.”</p><p>It was ridiculous, an absolutely silly anecdote about nothing in particular, but the timbre of Rio’s voice managed to loosen Agatha’s nerves and distract her from the rising panic. When she could finally breathe again, Rio’s hand gradually pulled away from her skin, and she slipped it out from beneath her shirt. “Okay?” she asked her softly. Agatha finally looked at her—her eyes were full of something Agatha didn’t want to name. She just nodded. Rio flipped the compress, her hand lingering so close to Agatha’s cheek. “I’m going to run to the store because I wasn’t prepared to cook a chicken soup tonight. Can I trust you to rest while I’m gone?” She searched Agatha’s eyes. Again, Agatha could only nod. But Rio didn’t move. “Agatha,” she nearly whispered, “I need you to use your words.” <em> Fuck. What the fuck was she doing to her. </em></p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat and rasped, “Okay.” Her body was burning. Her voice was broken. Yet, Rio smiled like it was the most precious sound she’d ever heard. And Agatha—Agatha lay there, her skin still tingling from where Rio had touched her, her chest aching, wanting everything Rio was willing to give her, and suspecting that there was a high probability she was ruined. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>When Agatha woke again, it was to the barely audible Beethoven from her living room area and the scent of seasoning and garlic. There was an undeniable presence in her home—someone else existed in this space alongside her at that moment, working around the kitchen. Her mind, sluggish and slow from fever, struggled to surface. She blinked against the grainy pull of sleep, her brain dragging itself through molasses to make sense of reality. Her eyelids were so heavy it felt like a cruel joke. Her head throbbed like someone had driven nails through her temples. Every inch of her body protested consciousness. She felt congested all over. Her ears felt like someone was pressing palms over them, her nose was stuffed beyond all reason, and her chest—tight. Her chest. The ghost of the gentle touch. Rio. Rio was here. The realization hit her with the force of a crashing wave—ice-cold and blinding. <em> Rio was here </em>. She was sick, helpless, vulnerable in a way she never allowed herself to be—and Rio had stayed. Agatha’s heart stuttered, then lurched into a panicked gallop. It felt unbearable in her ribs, frantic and confused.</p><p>Before she could surrender to the avalanche of implications, before her brain could spiral into shame and terror and longing, she heard her bedroom door open quietly as if not to disturb her in case she was still asleep. Her gaze snapped to the sound. Her breath hitched—Rio was balancing a tray on one hand with the grace of someone who’s done that a thousand times before. Her eyes met Agatha’s, and something softened instantly. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth—small, warm, almost reverent. Like seeing Agatha awake was a gift.</p><p>“I was about to wake you up,” she said, moving toward the bed and setting the tray on the nightstand. “You need to drink some water and eat.”</p><p>Agatha stared. This wasn’t real. This was a fever dream. A sweet, delusional hallucination brought on by dehydration and the unbearable ache of being alone too long. Rio wasn’t here. Rio couldn’t be here—with food, with that expression on her face. That look—like Agatha was something fragile, precious, and worth musing over. She opened her mouth to say something, anything, but all she managed was a dry crackle. Her throat felt like sandpaper. Humiliation burned down her spine—<em> pathetic </em>, that’s what she was, pathetic and sick and exposed—</p><p>Rio immediately reached for her, gently grabbing her shoulder and sliding her other arm under Agatha’s torso, lifting her up. She moved with no hesitation as if it were the most casual situation in the world. “Okay, we need to put some water in you,” she murmured, adjusting Agatha’s limp body into a semi-sitting position. “Sit,” she said, pulling the pillow under her back and leaning her over the headboard. She sat on the edge of the bed so close to Agatha that their thighs almost touched, grabbed the glass with water, and pressed it softly to Agatha’s lips. Not pushing, not forcing, but just holding it there. “Could you please drink this?” And the way that was asked—full of hope and tenderness, made Agatha involuntarily part her lips, letting Rio tilt the glass.</p><p>The first stream of liquid washed over her sore throat, and Agatha’s brain finally caught up, realizing how dehydrated she was. She chugged the entire glass—it felt divine. Her throat felt much better. She finished the whole glass before she even breathed again. It felt like waking from a long coma.</p><p>“Thanks,” she rasped. Despite popular assumptions, Agatha Harkness was capable of thanking people when necessary; she just rarely did so, as most people did not deserve her thanks. She could do everything herself and didn’t need help—she wouldn’t accept help. Therefore, there were not many scenarios in which she would have needed to thank others, but she did possess that ability. Now, she said that without even thinking, without weighing it in a significant way. Because now it felt like the most natural thing in the world. Maybe it was just fever, but Agatha caught that feeling deep within her—existing in Rio’s orbit felt like the most natural thing in the world. Like gravity had finally stopped pulling her in every direction, and was just... still. It was like she didn’t need to pretend to be someone else, didn’t need to carefully choose words, didn’t need to act a certain way. She could simply be, and Rio would accept her regardless. Definitely fever. </p><p>“I made you the king of all soup—the all-healing chicken soup—my abuelita's recipe,” Rio’s voice cut through her spiral yet again. It was starting to become a pattern—Rio pulling her out, grabbing her hand, and tugging her out of the dark, and making her feel less like she was drowning.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “‘Mnot hungry,” she mumbled, and of course her body decided that particular moment to betray her yet again, and her stomach growled. Rio tilted her head and rolled her eyes with that insufferably fond expression, the one that made Agatha want to scream or melt or throw herself off a bridge.</p><p>“Sure,” she said, already reaching for the bowl of soup.</p><p>“I don’t think I can chew or swallow anything thicker than liquid,” Agatha said—not in defiance, but with honest defeat. Her body felt too heavy, too tired. Even chewing felt like a battle she didn’t have the strength to fight.</p><p>“I know,” Rio quietly said. “I blended all the ingredients—it’s a purée soup, so you don’t need to chew anything.” She smiled softly and reached to brush a loose strand of hair from Agatha’s face. She didn’t even notice it was there until she felt a whisper of Rio’s touch on her skin. Her breath caught. Her heart clenched, stuttered, broke open in her chest. It was a simple gesture—Rio simply blended the soup. It was thoughtful. It wrecked Agatha. She wanted to scream. Or cry. Or kiss her.</p><p>The soup felt damn good. She couldn’t taste much, but it definitely made her feel much better and more human. She sat there, dizzy with exhaustion and barely able to keep her eyes open, watching Rio take the bowl and place it back on the tray with careful, practiced precision. Rio’s hands were a marvel—capable of conjuring miracles out of nothing, capable of transmitting jolts of electricity into Agatha’s skin at the mere contact. Agatha let her mind follow these thoughts—it was pleasant. She was warm and comfortable, still struggling but too tired to agonize about it, so it didn’t take long for her to start falling asleep. She felt Rio gently easing her down into the lying position again and cracked open one eye to look at her.</p><p>It felt like Rio’s smile was just ever persistent, or maybe it was just fever-inflicted hallucinations. “Sleep,” she whispered. “I’m staying in your guestroom tonight in case you need anything.”</p><p>And that was almost too much. The words barely registered before they hit like a sledgehammer. Rio was staying. Not out of obligation. Not because she was asked. But because she wanted to. And if Agatha hadn’t already been half asleep, she would’ve definitely argued under the effect of a solid mental meltdown and the beginning of a full-blown panic attack. Would’ve fought Rio on it. Would’ve thrown up every wall she could summon. But the only thing she could muster was a satisfied sigh and a smile before she let sleep sweep her into the limbo between realms. She felt the ghost of something blooming in her chest. It felt a little like safety, but also—</p><p>Agatha was sound asleep before the thought could fully form.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Next time Agatha woke wasn’t as brutal. Her head still felt stuffy, clogged like a poorly tuned instrument, but it was lighter now, less pounding. She could feel the aftertaste of fever-inflicted headache, but it was faint now—bearable. Her ears felt less congested, and no longer throbbed with every breath—she could finally draw air into her lungs without that sharp, stabbing pain. She was still very much sick, her body heavy and sluggish, but compared to yesterday, it felt like resurrection. Yesterday. Agatha’s inner monologue faltered, stalling mid-thought like a skipped heartbeat. Had yesterday really happened? Or had it been a fever-drenched hallucination, stitched together by the delirium that had gnawed at her brain? She slowly opened her eyes, preparing to squint at the daylight—bracing for the sting of discomfort. But pain never came—her drapes were shut tight. She didn’t remember doing that. There was no way she could do that, in fact, as she was half-dead last night when she collapsed into bed. <em> Wait… </em> she didn’t go to bed. She frowned, taking in her surroundings—she <em> was </em> in her bedroom. Somehow. The foggy memories flooded her mind—Rio and her ridiculously well-defined muscles, the warmth of her body, the faint smell of her perfume—something woody and a bit spicy—and how safe Agatha felt pressed against her.</p><p>She tried to find any confirmation of last night’s events—there was none. Although there was a tall shaker on her nightstand, along with a bottle of ready-to-drink hydration beverage. It was her favorite—grape flavored. Agatha slowly moved into a sitting position, her limbs groaning in protest, and reached for the liquids. She drank half the electrolytes, the flavor familiar and soft on her raw throat. When she grabbed the shaker and took the first sip, she moaned, involuntarily, helplessly. It was clearly a homemade protein shake—thick and creamy, and not chalky like most store-bought ones. It was rich in flavor and was hitting Agatha’s taste buds just right. To say it was pleasant on the stomach would be an understatement—it spread warmly, tender and soft like a well-loved quilt. Agatha could definitely taste banana and peanut butter, but there was something else she couldn’t quite recognize. What she could state with a hundred percent clarity, however, was that she was ruined for any other protein shake.</p><p>She was sitting on the edge of the bed, slowly sipping the shake, savouring it, and letting the reality sink in. She was deadly sick, and realistically, there was no way she could make it into work for the next couple of days. She needed to update Billy, although it was not essentially necessary as that was not anything new. Agatha didn’t get sick often, but when she did, it was pretty bad, so she would be forced to stay at home for several days. The first couple of days were the worst as she would feel like a dying swan, couldn’t move, let alone work. After the all-consuming pain and fever subsided, she would do some work from home until she felt semi-decent to reemerge into the real world. Billy would know to cancel the week. He always did. He never asked questions anymore, not after the first time she threatened to put a hex on his descendants for trying to bring her soup. So, mercifully, he never bothered her with trying to offer any kind of care, letting Agatha deal with it in her own way.</p><p>Agatha’s way was fine. Yes, maybe it wasn’t the most effective one, but it was efficient enough—lock yourself in the penthouse, ride out the fever like a storm, sleep it off full of penicillin. It worked. Being taken care of, fed, and observed was not Agatha’s way. It was… it felt invasive. Agatha felt like she was being placed under a microscope—she felt trapped. Given that perspective, it would’ve been logical for her to feel utterly uncomfortable now. She sighed, slowly finishing her shake, preparing for a fresh wave of embarrassment with a side of humiliation. However, by the time she finished both of her drinks, none of the devastating feelings came. She frowned and tried focusing on her sensations.</p><p>Behind the thick front of flu haze and aching muscles, there was something deep within her chest that she wasn’t sure she wanted to poke. She circled around as if approaching a wild animal—cautious, slow. It felt warm, a little tingling, but pleasant. It was small, tucked deep inside her ribcage—pricking faintly, like light through velvet. The more she paid attention to it, the more it bloomed—like a flower she didn’t remember planting, spreading the petals of gentle energy waves all over her like an invisible hug. It felt nice. Agatha realized that she didn’t mind it. She was uncertain as to whether she was welcoming it, but she didn’t want to run from it, either.</p><p>Maybe it was the fever’s aftermath. Or maybe she was just tired. Or maybe the stars had aligned wrong and broken her defenses for one brief, holy second. But she felt… open. Cracked in a way that didn’t hurt. And in that crack, feelings were seeping through—unfiltered, unguarded, terrifyingly real, and Agatha felt like allowing herself to feel for a moment. Without logic, without implications, without consequences, without restraint—the genuine feelings that she usually kept under seven seals deep within herself. And when she finally unleashed it, moving past the last wall, it didn’t consume her or overwhelm her like she initially feared it would. Instead, it spread evenly, filling every cell of her being with peace. Agatha sat very still, expecting the other shoe to drop, bracing for the backlash, expecting something to go wrong. Yet, seconds ticked, and nothing else came. That was… it felt strange. It felt like the entire self-protection campaign Agatha had carefully built was a lie. It felt like a trick. Like the universe was playing a cruel joke, showing her what she could’ve had all this time—if only she hadn’t been so afraid. Yes, it was definitely the aftermath of the fever. It seemed to take a toll on her this time around. But Agatha supposed there was nothing to lose—she wasn’t proposing her hand in marriage to anyone; she was simply deciding to allow herself to enjoy the dynamics. The very platonic dynamics with another human being. The <em> human connections </em> that Jen liked to tell her about, and Agtha never believed in. She was simply deciding to allow herself to try those. </p><p>She dragged herself into her ensuite bathroom and flinched looking in the mirror—her hair was a mess, tangled and greasy with sweat; she was paler than usual, and there were deep, dark circles under her eyes. She looked only half-alive. She needed a shower and she needed to brush her teeth badly. Shower had always made her feel better, and this time was no exception. She dried her hair on the towel, deciding against the blow dryer, brushed her teeth for longer than it was CDC-approved, and washed her face. She couldn't do anything about the dark circles, but at least she felt refreshed enough to emerge from her infection-infused dungeon of a bedroom. She put on sweatpants, a very thick, warm hoodie, and fuzzy socks. Yes, Agatha owned all of those things, but it was a secret, kept behind the closed doors of her home. A secret she realized she didn't mind Rio knowing—she’d seen much worse last night and still stayed with her.</p><p>Agatha dragged herself out of the bedroom at last. Slowly, hesitating. Preparing herself to find the penthouse empty, but hoping Rio would still be there. She emerged from the hallway into the open space of her living room-slash-kitchen, and her heart sank—Rio was nowhere to be seen. Agatha had already gone through a well-loaded spiral of explaining to herself why it should not matter, and why she should not feel disappointed, but no amount of rationalization could dull the sharp edge of that disappointment. She flopped onto the couch with a heavy sigh, some mix between a groan and surrender, and dropped her head back. Her eyes shut tight. She wasn’t the one to cry over something like this—especially over something like this. She wouldn’t—</p><p>The sound of the bathroom door came out of nowhere, it startled the living hell out of Agatha, making her full body shudder.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.” Rio’s soft voice was soothing the sharp edges of the shockwaves. She was moving toward the couch, drying her hands on a towel. “I wasn’t expecting you to be up for another hour or so,” she said, sitting next to Agatha. It all felt so casual, like they’d done that hundreds of times before, like they were familiar with each other on a deep, intimate level, and that domesticity was something they had grown so accustomed to that it was infused with their bones.</p><p>When Agatha’s brain had finally stopped short-circuiting, and her breathing returned to normal, she acknowledged the fact that she was just sitting there, staring at Rio. She needed to say something—anything. But what was she supposed to say? What was she supposed to start with?</p><p>
<em> Thank you. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You shouldn’t have stayed. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I appreciate you more than I would ever show. </em>
</p><p>
<em> There is so much happening, and I don’t know how to navigate any of that. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You feel like a gift from the universe—one I have never deserved and clearly received by mistake. </em>
</p><p>“Hi,” she said instead. Immediately, her entire soul cringed. <em>Hi?</em> <em>Fucking hi?</em> She had a master’s degree in business with almost two decades of running the most successful PR practice in North America, and <em>hi</em> was all she could manage? Was she an idiot?</p><p>Rio apparently didn’t think she was an idiot because Rio chuckled softly, and it landed like sunlight through fog. “Hi yourself,” she said, eyes twinkling, warm and open, like she could read Agatha’s panic and reached to soothe her. When Agatha finally found it in herself to look at her, Rio asked, “How are you feeling?” Her tone was not clinical or pitying, it was fond.</p><p>Agatha’s initial impulse was to brush it off as something insignificant, to put distance between herself and that unbearable tenderness, to deflect as always, saying something along the lines of <em> Well, I walked here, </em> or <em> Still alive, </em> or <em> It would take more than that to kill me </em>. But remembering that she decided to allow herself to feel, she said, “Better. Still sick, but definitely much better.” She didn’t regret choosing that approach because immediately, she was rewarded with Rio’s smile. Bright. Honest. Unfiltered. She wanted to say all those things she thought about, trying to choose one to start with when her eyes finally focused on Rio’s form. “You… changed,” she murmured instead, frowning. Seriously, was she an idiot? But can she really be blamed? A part of her wanted to appreciate Rio’s shoulders and arms while in a clearer state of mind. She had only caught a glimpse of it last night, but it made a strong impact even through the feverish fog. And now, Rio was sitting in front of her, wearing a plain, one-tone long-sleeve that seemed quite boring and disappointing. Agatha wanted to pout.</p><p>“I had to dash back home and grab some stuff when your temperature dropped,” Rio explained quietly. And it wasn’t lost on Agatha that, apparently, Rio had been checking on her throughout the night, and only stepped out when she was sure the fever was not getting worse. Has she slept at all? “I would never have imagined running into you here, much less staying over, so I had to go grab some essentials. Also, you were not supposed to see me like that.” </p><p>Agatha stared at her like she was saying something completely absurd. ”Umm… hello?” She gestured vaguely at her own chaos—way too casual hoodie with a faded image, pale skin, and undereye bruises.</p><p>Rio chuckled again, and perhaps that was starting to become Agatha’s favorite sound. “You’re allowed to be comfortable while home sick. I was at work.” <em> Comfortable </em> . The choice of her words. She didn’t say Agatha looked shitty or like a mess. Obviously, she wasn’t going to say anything like that because Rio was well-mannered, but she could’ve said literally anything else, worded it in any other way. Instead, she chose a simple, <em> comfortable </em> . And truth be told, Agatha was now noticing that she, in fact, was comfortable around Rio. With Rio. With this. With whatever this might be. Maybe that <em> human connection </em> wasn’t so overrated after all. And maybe, if she were very careful, very brave, and just reckless enough—</p><p>She could let it grow. The thought of paying Rio for her service still nagged at the back of her mind, but for now, she pushed it aside—she wasn’t going to fall into bed with this woman, so that fact did not affect their dynamics if their dynamics were simply talking. That sounded harmless enough.</p><p>“You scared me.” Rio’s voice brought her back to the present moment. It was prompt, honest, raw. Agatha didn’t know what to do with it—Rio’s tone and intensity of her gaze made it clear it wasn’t an inconvenience for her. Agatha wasn’t an inconvenience. </p><p>She wanted to say so many things, but instead, she deflected—bad habits die hard, they said. “It was just a fever.”</p><p>"Agatha," Rio said, her voice tinged with seriousness—and something deeper—"you could barely stay conscious. Your temperature wouldn’t drop for hours."</p><p>Agatha knew what was going to come next. <em> You can't live like this </em>. That was the most common thing people in her life said to her. She braced to receive it once again, mentally preparing a proper response. What Rio said instead completely threw her off.</p><p>“I need to touch you to make sure you're okay, and your temperature is not getting high again,” she said quietly as if she was scared that if it were said an octave louder, Agatha would not let her. </p><p>Agatha was just sitting there, staring. She wasn’t sure she was even blinking because <em> Excuse me? What? </em> Rio wasn't moving; her gaze was scanning Agatha’s face, waiting. <em> Okay. Motor function, hello </em>—Agatha needed her brain to respond to her commands. She needed to make her vocal cords work. Rio most likely just meant a thermometer—to measure her temperature with a thermometer, which did require some minimal touching. Agatha, CEO of overthinking, was absolutely overthinking it.</p><p>“Okay,” she finally succeeded in croaking out a response.</p><p>Rio moved then—she scooched toward Agatha, their bodies so close they were almost touching. Their faces were millimeters apart, and for a brief moment, Agatha thought she was going to kiss her. Rio looked into her eyes so deeply that Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. This close, she could see orange flecks in the browns of her eyes. This close, she could see fatigue hiding behind her careful warmth. Today, Rio opted for a subtle makeup look, contrasting with their first meeting when her eyes were accented with smoky hues. This close, Agatha could smell her powder. Her fingers were aching to trace her cheek.</p><p>“Have you slept at all?” she merely whispered.</p><p>“I caught a few hours when I was sure your fever stopped climbing.” She could feel Rio’s warm breath on her skin. It had a faint mint smell from probably brushing earlier, which made Agatha pat herself on the shoulder for deciding to shower and brush her own teeth before stepping out into “public”. Rio’s close proximity was making her hot all over again, but not with fever. She needed to ease the tension between them somehow, or she wouldn’t be responsible for what her still half-sick brain would conjure up. </p><p>She needed to ease the tension, or she was going to spontaneously combust. "I'm the one who doesn't sleep around here. Are you trying to steal my thunder?" Agatha tried, aiming for a joke. Was it flirting? Oh God, it was flirting.</p><p>Whatever that was, Rio played along. “I know. The audacity.”</p><p>Before Agatha could process what her brain was constructing and approve it for public consumption, her traitorous system went behind her back yet again, making her mouth say the words aloud, “I'd better watch you before you steal something else.”</p><p>She would’ve panicked, but Rio’s eyes sparked with mischief. “I can be sneaky,” she murmured. </p><p>“I doubt that,” she said with mock accusation.</p><p>Rio laughed then—low but bright. “Agatha, I sneaked vegetables into your diet. You’ve been eating them without complaining for almost a month.”</p><p>That distracted Agatha for a moment from Rio’s closeness until she felt warm lips on her forehead. She stopped breathing and froze. <em> What was happening? </em> Agatha only inhaled when Rio detached herself from her skin and looked at her with those careful eyes. She had questions, but before she could open her mouth, Rio was already talking as if sensing her confusion.</p><p>“Lips have a higher concentration of temperature-sensitive nerve endings compared to the hands. The skin on the lips is closer to the body's core temperature, which allows it to detect smaller temperature variations, making them more sensitive to subtle changes, so it's more likely to accurately reflect the body's overall temperature,” she explained calmly. And, <em> okay, wow. </em> It shouldn’t have been a thing, but Rio talking science was totally doing it for Agatha. She definitely got permanent brain damage from that fever.</p><p>“Okay,” was the only thing her brain could produce then, completely useless otherwise.</p><p>Rio studied her face for a long moment, and finally moved back to her previous spot on the couch. “We need to put some food in you,” she said, slowly raising up and changing the subject.</p><p>“I had the shake,” Agatha said. “Which, speaking of, has ruined me for any other shakes.” <em> Seriously, what was she doing?—Flirting, while still sick and looking like hell. What was wrong with her? </em> She wanted to scream.</p><p>“I’m sure, there is a way for you to have it every day,” Rio smirked. She <em> fucking </em> smirked! Who was flirting now? <em> Wait… </em>that was actually somehow worse. Because that suggested that Rio was interested, and Agatha had already established that it was very unlikely. So, what exactly was that? Permanent brain damage, Agatha reminded herself grimly.</p><p>“But you need actual food,” Rio continued without waiting for a reply. “Shake while sustainable is not a meal replacement—I just needed to make sure your protein levels were restored. You haven’t really eaten much in the past twenty-four hours—you need carbs and fiber.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. Here we go again. Different person, same lecture. “Yeah, I know what you're going to say next—the way I’m living is killing me.”</p><p>Rio frowned, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. “I wasn’t going to say that,” she replied honestly. “I was going to say that I’m glad I was here when you needed help.” She paused, a faint smile ghosted over her lips, “Even though you will never admit it.”</p><p>How could she read Agatha with such ease? She was glad Rio was here, too. If only she could say it. But wait… she could. Agatha opened her mouth—</p><p>She noticed a slight movement in her peripheral vision—Rio’s hand twitched as if she wanted to reach out and touch her. Agatha wished she would. But she hesitated. And at this very moment, it struck Agatha—Rio has been the one to reach out this entire time; she was the one to make all the first moves, moves that Agatha never responded to even once. Rio wasn’t aware of the turmoil of different feelings within Agatha; she didn’t know any of her internal struggles or hear her dialogues. From what Rio knew, Agatha was simply not interested. It ignited something deep within. Agatha realized with dreadful clarity that she did not want any of that to stop—did not want Rio to stop reaching out. And that this time, it had to be Agatha who made a step forward.</p><p>Catching this wave of reckless bravery, she reached for Rio’s hand. It was just a tentative slide of fingers over the back of her hand at first—feather light, a whisper of contact, yet it burned, persistent and real. She watched Rio’s eyes widen, then immediately soften into something achingly gentle. She grew very still as if afraid to breathe and break this moment. Agatha felt a surge of courage and gently squeezed Rio’s fingers. It was somewhat awkward, a half-touch that wasn’t quite full contact, resulting in hand-holding, but it still felt nice. She swallowed the lump in her throat and whispered, “I’m glad you <em> are </em> here.” Rio’s expression lit up as if she were a kid on Christmas morning, and Agatha couldn’t help the answering smile.</p><p>It was different to actually have Rio around instead of a ghost of a presence in the notes. They talked. About everything and nothing. It was nice and easy. It felt awfully domestic. Rio was kind and funny, and she never responded the way Agatha initially anticipated she would. Agatha learned soon enough that she was different—she didn’t think in standardized categories and would probably be considered weird by social norms. For Agatha, she didn’t seem <em> weird </em> in a way that needed to be <em> fixed </em> . She seemed <em> weird </em> in a way that fit that empty slot in Agatha’s soul—the soul that was incomplete by default, as if it were factory damaged, and she didn’t have any paperwork to return or refund it. Rio didn't flatten herself into socially acceptable shapes—she just was. Agatha, of course, had noticed those undertones in the notes, but she dismissed it as a miscommunication over that imperfect messaging system they’d built—Rio had built. Because it was hard to transmit information over paper, while your recipient was not even responding. But it was becoming clearer to Agatha the more they talked that Rio was actually like that, and the more they talked, the more comfortable she got and let her social acceptance mask slide. And that mere fact did something to Agatha, something she wasn’t sure how to articulate. Because Rio was absolutely everything she’d ever dreamt of in a potential partner. And right until now, she was bitterly aware that such a person could never exist in reality. Yet, here was Rio—odd for the entire world, and carefully assembled by the universe to be exactly right for Agatha. She wanted to scream.</p><p>Rio was stirring something on the stove. Agatha wasn’t sure what that was since her nose was still pretty stuffy, and she couldn’t really smell that well. Not that she cared that much—her attention was fully zeroed in on Rio. She was standing with her back to Agatha, and to her utter disappointment, she was wearing slightly baggy jeans today, that completely concealed her magnificent ass. Tragic. A tragedy, really. Truly. The jeans were cuffed neatly at the ankles, revealing <em> The Nightmare Before Christmas </em> socks. Rio had an apron on and a purple chef's hat. Purple chef’s hat with red eyes and ears on it—it was a Gengar. Yes, Agatha knew some Pokémon; she raised a boy during the late nineties. The stupid hat had a tail on the back, too, and Agatha couldn’t stop staring at it because that was ridiculous. There was a gorgeous woman in her house who was smart, funny, and kind. A woman who, in a matter of a month, somehow weaved her way into her heart without even talking in person. A woman whose vegetables were so good that Agatha forgot all about her beef with the greens. A woman who was preventing her demons from reaching her. And that woman was wearing a fucking Gengar hat with deadly seriousness because <em> Gengar is an extremely underrated Pokémon, Agatha—they are very powerful in battle if you Gigantamax them, and it’s purple. </em> Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>She was sitting at the counter, drinking tea, which was another thing Rio totally ruined her for. “I don’t normally do that—just lounge, doing nothing,” she said, moving her fingertip around the rim of the mug, and trying to switch her attention from the stupid hat. It wasn’t quite an attempt to justify her unproductivity or an excuse, or anything, really. She just felt like saying that—a tiny marble of personal information for Rio to collect if she wanted to. “That hasn’t happened in… forever.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “You are also getting a whole three-meals-a-day experience today. Bet, that hasn’t happened in forever either,” she said playfully. </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, “You’re not staying with me for the entire day, are you?”</p><p>“Why not?” Rio appeared truly puzzled, as if Agatha were requesting her to solve an advanced math problem.</p><p>“Because… I don’t know, life? Commitments?” she paused. “Family?”</p><p>Rio was still at the stove, so Agatha couldn’t see her face, but she could swear Rio smiled. “Is this your polite way of asking me whether I’m in a relationship?”</p><p>Agatha winced under her breath, “No, you’re right, it’s none of my business. I’m sorry.”</p><p>But RIo didn’t seem to be bothered. “There is no one, Agatha.” Not <em> single </em> , but <em> no one </em>. She said it slowly as if she wanted to be unmistakably clear. People could be single and still have stuff going on, but Rio chose to emphasize that there was no one. Rio had always chosen very specific wording for everything. She wasn’t just saying things—she meant them.</p><p>“How?!” Agatha wasn’t going to ask that, and surely she wasn’t planning on her voice to sound so high, but it just happened.</p><p>Rio chuckled fondly at the sound of her gasp. “I could ask you the same thing.”</p><p>There was <em> definitely </em> something happening here. The air between them hummed with it, and Agatha wanted to do something about it. "I never said I was single," she said, her voice low, almost daring. She lifted her mug to hide the faint curl of a smile threatening her lips, feeling reckless and warm in a way she hadn’t in years.</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up from where she was plating something at the stove, a wicked glint sparking to life in her eyes. She set the pan down with a soft clatter, wiping her hands on a dishtowel as she turned to face her fully. "Oh?" Rio’s mouth curved into a slow, teasing smirk. "So is there a secret missus hiding somewhere in this penthouse?"</p><p>She crossed the space in a few unhurried steps, casual in the way a tiger is casual before it pounces. Agatha's heart lurched painfully in her chest, the world narrowing to the sound of Rio’s bare feet padding across the hardwood, the tilt of her head, the playful lift of her brow. "Someone who’s going to kick my ass," Rio continued, her voice dropping into a soft, mock-worried register, "for trying to remind her lady to take better care of herself?"</p><p>Agatha felt her breath hitch, caught between laughter and something heavier, something dangerously close to longing. She set her mug down before she dropped it, fingers lingering a second too long against the rim. "Something," Rio added with a smile so bright it could've split her in two, "that should, by the way, be <em> her </em> job."</p><p>Agatha's fingers twitched, aching to reach out, to pull Rio closer and see if the magnetic pull between them was real or just her wishful thinking. This Rio was… bold. She liked it. In fact, she was sure she was blushing, but that could also be easily still fever. And if it still was fever, Agatha supposed there was no harm in indulging herself in a possibility—in allowing herself, just for a moment, to think of Rio as something more than a fleeting presence. It was just a moment of weakness, she told herself—she was sick and vulnerable, and Rio was here all gentle and carrying, and understanding, and Agatha was warm all over, and it felt nice, and she would absolutely totally stop thinking that tomorrow. But today…today she would indulge herself just a little, just to help her system recover faster.</p><p>Breakfast was simple. Just some oatmeal with banana, raisins, sugar-free syrup, and vanilla protein because apparently Agatha was not eating enough protein. Because, apparently, that wasn’t just some bodybuilding thing or an emergency remedy. She didn’t argue, letting Rio educate her about different kinds of protein and its effects on the human body. She was such a nerd, and it was cute, and Agatha was weak. The oatmeal tasted incredible, by the way. Agatha had no idea it was possible to make something that simple that good. She wished she had Rio cook her breakfast every morning; she wished they could just lounge like this every day after it—warm and comfortable, and softly talking about nothing in particular. It felt pleasant. But the reality was Agatha’s rough 5 am mornings included an exquisite breakfast selection of ibuprofen, nootropics, and more shots of espresso than should be legal. So, Agatha reasoned, if she hit a lottery and had one full day with Rio all to herself, she would take full advantage—no overthinking and no guilt. They would return to how things were tomorrow, and she would regret wasting time spiraling when she could have just enjoyed herself. Enjoyed Rio.</p><p>Morning slowly progressed into noon. They were lazily talking, and some random marine life documentary on the TV was in the background, humming at a low volume. Rio did most of the talking while Agatha absorbed various insights about her, deepening her fondness for the woman with each passing moment. She’d learned that Rio was the only child; she lost her parents when she was very young, and ever since, she had been on her own—a couple of friends, but remaining a hermit. They were more alike than Agatha had initially anticipated—running on stardust along for so long. Rio found it difficult to connect with people, too, and preferred quiet nights in, tending to her plants instead. She loved plants much more than people, and Agatha could easily understand that. She loved food—not the consumption process of it, but the science behind it, and, of course, cooking, which in a way resembled science as well. Similar to mixing chemicals to initiate a reaction, ingredients were combined to create a dish.</p><p>Lunch was also simple. Just some grilled chicken breast with sweet potatoes, and Rio’s signature broccoli that she wouldn’t show Agatha how to make because <em> It is a secret recipe, Agatha. The only thing that makes me valuable. </em> She was adorable. Agatha found herself smiling today more than she’d been smiling for her entire life.</p><p>“I was expecting you to weigh your food for some reason,” Agatha commented, leaning casually against the counter as she watched Rio plate their food with charming ease.</p><p>“I am weighing it,” Rio simply replied, her voice even, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Agatha raised an eyebrow, skeptical, and tilted her head slightly, prompting Rio to elaborate. “In my mind," Rio added, a slight, lazy shrug rolling off her shoulders. "I can eyeball the approximate weight of anything—I’ve been in a relationship with food for a really long time." She said it so nonchalantly, like it wasn’t a big deal. Like having the ability to fucking weigh stuff with nothing but her brain was just some normal thing everyone could do.</p><p>“How accurately?” Agatha asked, her arms crossing over her chest in disbelief. There was no way that method was even remotely reliable.</p><p>“Pretty accurate," Rio said, still maddeningly calm, her tone measured and clear, like she wasn’t even trying to impress her. "Give or take a couple of grams."</p><p>Yeah, no way. Agatha narrowed her eyes, suspicious. “While I admire your confidence, I find it very unlikely,” she drawled, already moving toward the kitchen junk drawer. She rifled through it until she found a small digital kitchen scale, triumphant. “How many grams is this chicken?” Agatha pointed at the piece of meat sitting neatly on Rio’s plate, eyebrow arched.</p><p>Rio blinked at her, amused. “Are you serious?”</p><p>“Humor me,” Agatha said sweetly, the corner of her mouth twitching into a smirk.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes—affectionately, not annoyed—and studied the piece of chicken with laser-like precision. “Approximately, ninety-seven grams.”</p><p>Agatha set the piece down carefully on the scale. It blinked once, twice, before settling on—<em> 96 g. </em>Just a fluke, Agatha decided instantly, refusing to be impressed. “Do the potato?” she challenged, pointing.</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, peering at the potato with an almost scientific detachment. “One hundred forty-eight grams.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath, placing it on the scale—<em> 148 g </em> . even. She stared at the number, her mind blank for a beat. <em> How?! </em>“Do the—” she started, looking for another item, but Rio cut her off, chuckling low in her throat.</p><p>“Are you a cat, Agatha?” Rio teased, a glint of mischief in her eyes.</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked, thrown off.</p><p>“Stop playing with your food and eat it before it gets cold,” Rio said softly, smiling as she finally sat down, cutting into her chicken with unbothered grace and taking a bite like she hadn’t just performed some impossible party trick.</p><p>There was another marine life documentary when they relocated back to the sofa, likely some marathon on National Geographic. Agatha didn’t care; all she wanted was to hear more of Rio’s stories. She genuinely wanted to know her, which literally never happened. Agatha was great with her clients, knew all sorts of personal things about them, but that was somehow impersonal—she wielded that information as a weapon aimed to conquer. Now, not only was she interested in someone, but she also wanted to share herself with them. That would have been terrifying had it not been Rio, because Agatha quickly learned that when it came to Rio, everything she thought she knew was reevaluated. Somehow, Rio, with her kind, open, warm gaze that lingered on Agatha just a little too long, unlocked a sense of safety and peace she hadn’t known existed within her before.</p><p>“Did you know that seahorses mate for life?” Rio suddenly asked, her eyes glued to the screen where two seahorses were tangled together like in a dance. Agatha knew that, vaguely—some random fact stored in the depths of her memory lane, probably learned in school, insignificant. It was the way Rio had said it, filled with so much longing, that struck Agatha like a lightning bolt, leaving goosebumps in its wake. “They rub their noses together, and cuddle, and it is actually scientifically proven that they look forward to seeing one another—they experience longing just like we do.”</p><p>And Agatha, who has never been open about her feelings in public, who never shared any personal information besides what was considered a polite exchange—that Agatha watched the words leave her mouth in slow motion as if they were said by someone else, someone who possessed her body and captured her mind. “I’ve never been involved with anyone who made me feel even remotely like that.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped at her immediately after the words materialized into this world. “Never?” she asked quietly. Agatha shook her head. “Me either.” <em> Oh </em>.</p><p>“This is rather sad—unable to relate to a seahorse,” Agatha chuckled bitterly at last. It was also rather stupid. Agatha hasn’t shared anything too profound for the entire day—just skin-deep, surface facts, and now, out of the blue, her traitorous system decided to throw her under the bus like this. How poetic—melancholy dipped in fever—Sylvia Plath material. </p><p>Rio was looking at her in a way that made Agatha’s insides burst into sparkles—with complete concentration, adoration, and awe. Agatha hated clichés, but nobody had ever looked at her like that—like she was something to unfold layer by layer, yet not to possess or claim, but to hold, cherish, and care for.</p><p>She didn’t know how long they had been sitting in that comforting silence. So lost in the warmth radiating from Rio, she didn’t acknowledge the movement until it was too late, and she was right beside her. “I’m going to touch you again now,” she murmured, voice dropping into a near whisper. “You begin to look tired. I need to check your temperature.” Agatha’s heart stumbled painfully against her ribs. She blinked at Rio, momentarily forgetting how breathing worked. Did she not realize that thermometers existed? Agatha had one gathering dust in her medicine cabinet. She could have easily pointed to it, demanded they do this properly. But… she enjoyed this method infinitely better. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered back, her voice threading into the small space between them. She barely had time to brace herself before Rio’s lips brushed her forehead. Just like the previous time, it was a soft, warm contact that left Agatha just a tiny bit lightheaded. She shut her eyes, willing herself to memorize every molecule of sensation—Rio’s breath ghosting against her skin, the gentleness, the grounding heat.</p><p>Rio hummed and retreated, yet didn’t move away too far. She was looking at Agatha with that calculated precision again, carefully scanning her face. “Your temperature is a little high,” Rio assessed calmly, her voice that same steady cadence Agatha had already started associating with <em> safety. </em> “Not high enough to be considered fever, but high enough that you need some rest to help it subside.” Her gaze flickered, catching a loose strand of Agatha’s hair curling rebelliously along her cheek. Before Agatha could react, Rio reached out and, with unbearable tenderness, tucked the strand behind her ear. Agatha forgot how lungs worked. It felt different this time—this time she was fully conscious and aware of every quark of energy sparkling between them. She needed to scream.</p><p>“Could you do me a favor and nap a little bit?” Rio asked, her voice lilting into a soft plea, crowned with a small, almost shy smile. “It will majorly contribute to your recovery. I will start dinner and wake you up when it’s ready.” Agatha did not want to nap; well, she could use an hour or so of sleep, but she didn’t want to lose any precious minutes she could be spending with Rio instead. But the way she had worded it, goddammit. It was not an order, not a scolding—just a request. What was up with that woman and wording things perfectly? It was like she knew exactly what Agatha’s next move would be and prevented it from happening, slipping past all of her defenses by simply using a different word, the one that would resonate with her. It should’ve felt invasive, but instead, Agatha felt seen.</p><p>Dinner was easy and quiet—domestic, cozy. Rio was lazily recounting absurd and surprisingly charming highlights from the history of the potato, of all things. And somehow, despite herself, Agatha was entertained. Apparently, Rio could make any random food fact interesting. The way Rio told a story, even the most mundane facts became lively, vivid—colored with a sly wit and understated humor, and Agatha didn’t want the moment to end. By the time they reached their tea, the world outside had completely fallen away. It was just the two of them, suspended in this tiny pocket of time, when Agatha realized something. Usually, when she got to the tea part, she would enjoy whatever <em> on-the-house </em> treat Rio left her that day.</p><p>Agatha cradled her cup, feeling a little bold. She tilted her head just so and asked, “So… what is my <em> on-the-house </em> treat of the day tonight?”</p><p>Rio regarded her with her signature calculated gaze, scanning every twitch of her facial muscles, and returning to her eyes as if searching for the parts of Agatha she didn’t know how to hide. “I’ve been here for the past twenty-four hours, doing… things,” she said, her tone neutral at first. But then her mouth curled into a mischievous smile, her voice slipping into something warmer, more playful, “<em> I </em> am your <em> on-the-house </em> treat of the day tonight.” Agatha choked on her tea, coughing violently as Rio smirked. Oh, that was... that was bad.</p><p>That was so much worse than Agatha was prepared for. She wanted to scream. She wanted to sink into the floor. She wanted to kiss her senseless.</p><p>It hit Agatha all at once—how much she didn’t want Rio to leave. The thought of being alone again, after this impossible, golden bubble of time they'd shared, was unbearable. But Rio had been here for over twenty-four hours. She needed to go home eventually, no matter how Agatha’s heart protested. Even if she was growing drowsy again, worn out from the emotional whirlwind and the stubborn remnants of her illness, it still felt <em> tragic. </em></p><p>Rio prepared her a hot casein beverage with honey, swearing that it was a remedy for restless sleep during the flu, and asked Agatha to <em> please go to sleep for the night </em> , her tone somewhere between a promise and a lullaby. And, <em> fine, okay, </em> apparently Agatha was a little pushover when it came to this woman because she wanted to do anything she asked her to.</p><p>They lingered at the front door, both pretending they weren’t stalling. The air between them hummed, charged, and heavy with unsaid things. Agatha leaned back against the wall, her body thrumming with exhaustion and adrenaline all at once, and fidgeted slightly with her fingers. Somehow, she found the courage to say, “Circumstances aside… I had a very good day.” She watched Rio carefully, bracing for rejection, for deflection. But instead, Rio smiled—that breathtaking, wide-open smile that made Agatha feel like she was standing in sunlight.</p><p>She hesitated for a split second, but then reached for Agatha’s restless fingers. She held them lightly, squeezing just once—<em> exactly </em> the way Agatha had done that morning, echoing the gesture back to her without a single word. Her voice, when she finally spoke, was quiet and warm, threading straight into the hollow places of Agatha’s chest.  “Me, too.” In an inexplicable way, that almost brought Agatha to the brink of tears.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Agatha expected something to change. She didn’t know what exactly—just that something should shift.. She was afraid their dynamics would shift, but nothing happened. Rio was still coming over every day, making her the most devastating meal, leaving a treat, and a note. The notes didn’t stop—on the contrary, they’d become deeper, longer, and more personal. They started looking like real letters, and Agtha couldn’t be more thrilled. She read them during dinner, and then again in bed, right before falling asleep. It felt like Rio was there with her. It felt… nice.</p><p>It was Agatha’s birthday—an ordinary day just like any other. Everyone in her life—all… two people… and Billy… and Mrs. Hart—knew better than to mention it. It wasn’t that Agatha despised her birthday or thought anything negative about it, really. She simply didn’t find the day significant and didn't see a point in wasting her time on unnecessary celebrations. She had more important things to busy her life with. She didn’t like acknowledgements either. You wanted to wish her a happy birthday? You needed to prepare to fight then. Agatha just didn’t want this kind of attention. It had taken years, but finally, she had reached the point in her life where everyone made peace with it and left her alone.</p><p>Agatha disliked working late on her birthday, not because of the day itself, but because every app, every store, every algorithm on earth felt the need to "celebrate" her with relentless, insulting notifications. Exclusive offers, birthday discounts, limited-time coupons. God have mercy on her worn soul, piss off already. Agatha had everything she needed. And if there were things she didn’t yet have... well, that just meant they weren’t obtainable yet. But she was working on it. She always was. This year, there was one particular thing on her wishlist. And for once, it wasn’t something she could bring into existence with hard work. It was a quiet little thing. Soft. Personal. And Agatha reasoned that, since it was her birthday, maybe... maybe she could let herself have it. Just for tonight. She could go back to normal again tomorrow. </p><p>The thing in question was simple: time with Rio.</p><p>Agatha was standing in the hall, in front of her front door, taking measured breaths to calm her racing heart. It was a little after five, so Rio was there, likely still cooking. Agatha turned the knob, stepped through — and startled Rio so badly, she yelped.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio squeaked, wide-eyed.</p><p>Agatha bit back a laugh. “I live here,” she said dryly, “this is my penthouse.” Rio just stared at her, like she couldn’t quite believe it, like she was trying to connect the dots in real time, and Agatha would’ve started second-guessing her decisions if it weren’t for an awestruck smile that was spreading across Rio’s face. “I’m Agatha, by the way,” she added teasingly.</p><p>“My brain is rebooting now. Please hold while I’m trying to connect you,” Rio said, completely deadpan.</p><p>Agatha snorted—full, unexpected laughter spilling out. <em> Dork </em> . She started moving toward the kitchen when she saw it. <em> And oh, no. No no no no no. It’s been going so well; Rio’s been so attentive to the details, so perfect. Please, no. </em>“Rio,” Agatha said sharply, her voice low and warning. “Tell me that’s not a birthday cake.” Because, of course, Rio knew it was her birthday—it was on Agtaha’s file after all. But Rio didn’t know her birthday was a no-go. How would she? Agatha has never opened up about anything personal, so technically it was Agatha’s fault. Rio was simply being Rio and attempting to do something nice for her; she did nothing wrong. Yet, Agatha could already feel the first signs of anger within her.</p><p>Rio, unaware of the turmoil, said, “This is not a birthday cake. This is a birthday pecan pie.” Her tone was unbothered, even.</p><p>Agatha was choosing the right words to start this fight because, yes, they absolutely were going to fight, but she didn’t want to go very hard on Rio at the same time since it was her first strike. She opened her mouth when her gaze caught the surface of the pie and—</p><p><em> Happy Birthday Mr. Vonnegut </em>said the line on the pie. Agatha blinked. She looked at Rio, looked at the pie, looked at Rio again. “Are you serious?” she finally mustered.</p><p>“He is a very notable author, Agatha,” Rio said sweetly, sing-songing the words in a fake whine that didn’t even try to sound serious. Agatha kept staring at her, not replying. “You once mentioned that you allowed yourself to indulge in the flavor of pecan pie a couple of times a year on a special occasion,” Rio offered an explanation. She remembered. Agatha had only said it once in passing that morning they had breakfast back when she was sick.</p><p>“And you decided… that special occasion was Vonnegut’s birthday? Is it even his birthday today?” Agatha asked, already googling with one hand. <em> Kurt Vonnegut, born: November 11, 1922 </em> . It was his birthday. <em> Goddammit </em>. God damn that perfect woman, and her perfect wording, and her perfect timing, and her perfect attention. Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>“He’s made an impact,” Rio added with a tiny, smug shrug. Agatha raised an eyebrow in question. “Agatha, your Player Piano <em> hardcover </em> is dog-eared.” Agatha gasped, scandalized. Rio just grinned wider, “What? You have a massive home library right next to the kitchen, and expect me never to look? When do you even make time to read?”</p><p>Agatha tried to fight it, but the heat rising in her chest was too warm to push away. Rio knew it was her birthday, but what struck Agtaha, however, was the careful way she was trying to approach it instead of trying to weaponize it. She didn’t make a big deal out of it. She found a way to honor it, to honor Agatha, without setting off all her alarms. And somehow, it made Agatha feel seen. In a way, she didn’t realize she’d been starving for. Agatha realized then that she wanted to let her. So, she silently moved to the cutlery cabinet, pushing past Rio. She opened the drawer, grabbed a fork, a knife, and a spoon, opened the upper cabinet, grabbed a plate, and added it all next to her setup at the dinner table in the corner. She then sat at the counter and looked at Rio, expectant. Rio was watching her with a frown, following her moves but saying nothing—cautious, unsure. Agatha’s heart kicked hard in her chest.</p><p>“You’re staying over,” she simply said.</p><p>“You want me to stay for a pie?” Rio’s tone was amused as if she couldn’t believe what she had just heard.</p><p>“I want you to stay for dinner.” Agatha let the words sit there, heavy and real. <em> Fuck it </em> . It was Agatha’s birthday, and if she could have just one thing— <em> this </em> is what she wanted. She hasn’t celebrated since she was twenty-seven; the universe owed her a lot of gifts. She only wanted one—this one. She added after a moment, “If that’s okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled then. “If I’m staying for dinner, you’re helping me cook it,” she said, already wrapping an apron around her torso. It was a grey standard apron with pockets up front, like the one she’d seen her wearing before. The only difference was that this apron had the plain text on it—<em> REAL MEN CAN COOK LIKE THEIR MAMA. </em> Agatha arched an eyebrow, amused. Rio reached the pocket and pulled the chef’s hat. This one was red with eyes, a stick going through it, and a green dragon tail in the back. Agatha did not know this Pokémon.</p><p>“How many of these do you own?” she chuckled softly.</p><p>Rio lit up like a kid on Christmas. ”I only wear Dipplin when I focus on desserts because they are a caramel apple. It only makes sense,” she explained excitedly. “But they also evolve into a really cool dragon, so I can wear it when I cook other stuff, too.” Agatha had absolutely no clue how a character on the hat was connected to Rio’s work, but she was stupidly cute, babbling about it, and Agatha was maybe adoring her a bit too much to care. “They are one of my absolute favorite Pokémon,” Rio said, adjusting the hat proudly, “a special hat is for a special occasion—seemed fitting for today.” All she could do was sit there, propping her chin on her hand, watching Rio buzz around her kitchen like she belonged there, and try really hard not to fall completely, hopelessly in love with her. Nicky’s favorite Pokémon were dragon type, too. He would’ve loved this one. He would’ve loved Rio. Agatha’s heart was swelling in her chest.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>It had been a little over a month, and Agatha finally decided to reply. It shouldn’t have to be a big deal. It was just a gesture. She hasn’t celebrated her birthday since she was twenty-seven, and Rio made the day so low-profile, yet meaningful, that Agatha could not just let it slide. She had a great time, and she wanted to thank Rio for that. She pulled up at The Green Thumb the next day, two minutes after the business opened. She couldn’t help it, she felt excited—something she had only felt before securing a new client. Only this time, there was something more to it, something Agatha had been carefully circumventing.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed as she entered, but the receptionist didn’t immediately acknowledge her. The woman glanced up briefly and then went back to typing on her computer, offering a polite, “I’ll be with you in a second, ma’am.” It only took a moment for her brain to catch up, and her head snapped up, eyes widening as she realized who had walked in. “I apologize, Ms. Harkness! I didn’t recognize you. You look… different,” she said quickly, rising from her desk, clearly flustered. Did she really look that different? Agatha wondered, but before she could think about it more, the receptionist added, “Please, come in, come in. Mrs. Davis doesn’t have anything scheduled until noon today, so she’ll be happy to see you.” As they walked toward the office door, the woman’s gaze flicked over Agatha once more, a sultry, yet polite smile tugging at her lips. “We’re always happy to see you. It’s been a while.” Agatha froze. Was she flirting with her? It had been a long time since anyone had tried to flirt with her. Or maybe Agatha had just stopped noticing it. Either way, she couldn’t say it didn’t catch her off guard.</p><p>“Look what the cat dragged in,” Mrs. Hart greeted, as Agatha stepped into the office.</p><p>Polite introductions to conversations be damned—Agatha had known Sharon Hart Davis for almost two decades. Mrs. Hart had been one of her first clients, and over time, they had become more than just business acquaintances. They had become <em> people </em> in each other's lives. Agatha didn’t like the word “friend”—it felt too intimate for someone who prided herself on her emotional distance.</p><p>“I need a plant,” Agatha said, skipping the pleasantries.</p><p>“Agatha-<em> I don’t think nutrition is necessary for survival </em>-Harkness needs a plant?” Mrs. Hart’s voice dripped with playful sarcasm. “You do know that plants require care, right? You may not need nutrition, but they do.” Her tone was not stern, per se, nor was it judging. She was just nagging Agatha all the time like a mother would nag her child.</p><p>“I just want to purchase one plant with no extra bullying, please,” she growled, already feeling the familiar irritation bubble up.</p><p>“Ah, but darling, bullying is always on the house. Specially reserved for you.” Mrs. Hart grinned mischievously. Seriously, could Agatha have <em> one </em> normal person in her life? Just one—is it that much to ask for?</p><p>After a beat, Mrs. Hart softened. “It’s good to see you, Agatha,” she said, her expression becoming more sincere as she regarded Agatha with her sharp gaze. “You look well.”</p><p>“I’ve been sleeping more lately. And getting some nutrients… from actual food.”</p><p>Mrs. Hart said nothing to that, only hummed in acknowledgement, clearly pleased with what she heard. “Okay, what kind of plant are we talking?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You know perfectly well, I know nothing about plants,” she admitted. Because it was true. And despite popular assumptions, Agatha Harkness was able to admit facts when those were statistically accurate.</p><p>Mrs. Hart smirked and tilted her head knowingly, “Does the plant have anything to do with your recent changes?”</p><p>“Maybe?” Agatha replied evasively. They were absolutely not talking about Rio. No. It was no big deal. Nothing was happening, and Agatha had no intention of discussing her evolving dynamic with Rio with anyone. She was a very private person, thank you very much.</p><p>Mrs. Hart raised an eyebrow, catching the change in Agatha’s tone. “God give that woman patience to handle Agatha Harkness,” she teased, the words light but pointed.</p><p>Agatha bristled. Even though it was based on a truth she couldn’t deny, she didn’t like the assumption. Not one bit. “It’s nothing like that,” she said a little too aggressively.</p><p>“I’m sure it isn’t,” Mrs. Hart responded with a knowing smile before switching back to business. “What are you trying to say with the plant?”</p><p>Agatha had thought about this for a while—on the way to The Green Thumb, she had a clear idea of what she wanted to convey. But when it came down to it, words failed her. She wasn’t great at expressing feelings or communicating anything that wasn’t related to work. That had always been a struggle for her. “Umm… thank you?” she offered finally because, essentially, that was what she wanted to say.</p><p>Mrs. Hart’s eyebrows shot up as if she knew exactly what kind of turmoil Agatha had been going through daily for the past month, and couldn’t believe a thank you was all she came up with. Although if she wanted to make an amused comment, she didn’t, she just hummed thoughtfully, a glimmer of understanding in her eyes, and Agatha was grateful for that. </p><p>They chose a cyclamen—a beautiful plant with neat leaves and delicate pink flowers. It was visually striking, and that was enough for Agatha as she really knew literally nothing about plants. She just hoped Rio would like it.</p><p>She stopped by the penthouse on her way to the office and carefully placed the pot on the kitchen counter, the spot where she knew Rio was usually doing all the chopping. She liked it—the plant, the placement, the gesture. Yet, something was missing. She dashed to her home office and came back with a sticky notes pad and a black pen. Again, there were so many things she wanted to say—things that would never fit into the tiny square of a sticky note sheet. She uncapped the pen and doodled a small, simple, little heart. It was perfect. Just like Rio. Agatha smiled, heart full of affection, capped the pen, and left the note beside the plant before heading out the door.</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha was not dumb. She acknowledged precisely what was happening. Rio, somehow, paved her way into her perfectly scheduled life and managed to set a permanent camp there. She was making Agatha break her habits and change her point of view on things she thought she knew to a T. It was subtle and gentle, not rough and demanding like Wanda, not pressing and pushing like Jen—it felt nice, felt natural. It slipped under her skin without resistance, reshaping her from within, not through force, but through its unbearable kindness. And Agatha realized then that she really didn’t mind the change; it was making her into this new version of herself that wasn’t quite bad. In fact, Agatha had to admit, she liked this woman—a woman who laughed a little softer, who lingered at windows just to watch the snow fall, and the sun shine, who sometimes caught herself smiling at nothing at all.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha didn’t receive a comment on the plant or any acknowledgement of it that night. She would be lying if she said it didn’t affect her. She tried not to think about it—Rio didn’t owe her anything. Besides, it was Agatha who hadn’t replied to Rio’s attempts to establish communication ever since it started, so what was she expecting, really? She thought they’d shared a few moments the other day, but maybe she had severely misread their dynamics. Maybe she had imagined the gentleness, the way Rio’s lips had hovered a second longer than necessary against her forehead, the way her voice had dipped into something almost reverent. Maybe she had built it all up inside her own head, a fantasy stitched together out of loneliness and the desperate, tender hunger she hadn’t allowed herself to name. She was second-guessing everything now, rewinding every single interaction, every single line of dialogue, every lingering gaze, every touch in her mind—slicing herself open on memories she wasn’t even sure were real now.</p><p>Mercifully, her agony was short-lived. She returned home the following night and spotted it right away (not that she had looked in the direction of the kitchen first thing upon entering the penthouse, of course)—a single, pink cyclamen flower carefully placed in a tall pint full of water. Her breath caught. There was a sticky note on the pint, too.</p><p>
<em> His name is Beauford, and my girl Vanessa has finally gotten a boyfriend. She says thank you. </em>
</p><p>Under the pint there was a single Polaroid photograph tucked in. <em> There were people out there who still owned a working Polaroid? </em> Agatha blinked at it, her heart knocking unevenly against her ribs. There were two plants in the picture, one Agatha recognized as hers—the one she’d given to Rio, the other one was, apparently, Vanessa. <em> Who named their plants? </em>Apparently, Rio did. Of course she did. That strange, tender creature, living with a softness Agatha had long since buried under armor. She chuckled, despite herself, and shook her head affectionately. And just like that, the heavy weight on her shoulders had lifted, and she could breathe again. Rio loved the plant. Agatha smiled.</p><p>It changed after that. Agatha started scheduling her four o’clock meetings out of the office, so she wouldn’t need to come back. If Billy noticed that things were out of the ordinary, he never commented. Yet, Agatha saw him suppressing a smile every time she left the office for her four o’clock, as if he knew, as if he was quietly rooting for her without saying a word. She was trying not to be obvious and was only doing that a couple of times a week, telling herself it was nothing, it was just a “test-drive”. But the truth was shimmering there, just beneath the surface: she was drawn, irrevocably, to the possibility that had opened up between them. She wanted more time in Rio’s orbit. She wanted to <em> be seen, </em> not as the intimidating CEO, not as a project, and especially not as a broken woman holding herself together by burying her life in work, but just <em> as herself, </em> raw and fallible and human.</p><p>When she first got home at around six one day, she caught Rio packing to leave. Rio, usually so composed, was surprised to see Agatha home so early and was visibly caught off guard, and just a little skittish. It was new—those dynamics were new, and neither of them knew quite how to navigate the uncharted terrain. Rio had fallen into some kind of perfected routine with the way she prepared the nights for Agatha, like a ritual she honored even when no one was watching. So it was only natural that she was slightly thrown off now that Agatha was actually here and could react to her efforts in real time. And Agatha Harkness was anything but unreasonable, even when her own instincts screamed at her to seize, to conquer, to possess—she decided to ease Rio into those hopefully new dynamics without shattering the fragile equilibrium she had established. She simply leaned on the coat closet by her front door, lingering there while Rio prepared to leave. She didn’t go straight to the kitchen, didn’t comment on anything, didn’t push. She just let herself exist in that time and space—in Rio’s orbit, where the air always seemed a little warmer, a little softer. That made Rio relax a little, the tension bleeding out of her shoulders, and they shared a quick, casual interaction, mainly the highlights of Agatha’s menu for the night. When Rio left, it didn’t feel disappointing or like a failure. Sure, Agatha wanted her to stay longer, wanted to reach out and close that last aching inch between them, but she also understood that this new thing had to marinate for a bit before it could bloom into something real—she wouldn’t force it. She would let it grow, tender and unhurried, in the safety of patience.</p><p>It was nothing significant at first—random and casual, something that could easily be brushed off as a coincidence. Coincidence that Agatha happened to have a short meeting and came home at the same time Rio was about to leave. Coincidence that their conversations lingered a little longer each time. Yet it was resonant, soul-deep, how Agatha got that feeling of anticipation with a side of butterflies at the mere prospect of seeing the woman, and it was clear from Rio’s expression—those eyes lighting up, that easy, delighted smile—that she, in turn, was thrilled to see Agatha. She started lingering, cleaning the surfaces that didn’t need extra cleaning, pretending to busy herself while sneaking glances in Agatha’s direction. They talked while moving around the kitchen as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. As if it were just Agatha coming home to find Rio waiting for her, busy with basic household chores in the meantime. As if the cold vastness of Agatha’s penthouse was slowly, miraculously, becoming a home.</p><p>It made Agatha feel so many things she didn’t know how to feel. Because how do you just wake up one day, fully aware that you’re an achieved-everything-in-life fifty-year-old, and realize that you’ve actually been craving completely different things all along? How do you acknowledge the hollow places inside you that no success, no prestige, no amount of calculated control had ever managed to fill? Yet, you made your soul forget that by drowning it in social standards and unhealthy coping mechanisms, and it had taken a hurricane named Rio to blow all that artifice away. It would’ve been confusing and overwhelming had it not been for Rio. Rio, who simply had been Rio, and made everything seem so easy just by smiling that bright smile that made her eyes sparkle, and Agatha’s soul full of tiny fireworks—colorful, and warm, and promising. Fireworks that spoke of beginnings, not endings. Of hope, fragile but fierce.</p><p>
<em> Allow yourself a break, and I promise to keep you safe from your demons if you decide to spend it with me. </em>
</p><p>Agatha was still processing it. She replayed those words in her mind over and over, as if turning them over in her hands would make them safer to believe in. Rio had said it so effortlessly, as if it weren’t a major fucked-up thing about Agatha—her fear of stopping, her bone-deep terror that if she paused for even a moment, everything inside her would shatter. She had said it so softly, as if it didn’t bother her at all. But what if it really didn’t? What if Agatha had finally, against all odds, met someone who was mentally strong and steady enough for both of them to accept her with all her baggage, gentle enough to hold all her broken pieces without flinching? That was a dangerous path of thinking. Dangerous because it made her want. Dangerous because it made her hope. Agatha shook her head slightly and massaged her temple. No, she didn’t have a migraine; it was more of a habit by now—muscle memory—deep in thought was equivalent to massaging temples. She was painfully aware that, technically, Rio was under her employ as she was still paying her for the service. Yet, she was also painfully aware that she wanted to see if this, whatever that was, could become something. And that wanting was sharp enough to make her bleed.</p><p>“Billy,” she pressed her intercom button before she talked herself out of it. She heard the door of her office crack open, and Billy let himself in, typing something on his tablet, yet fully alert and present, as he always was when it came to her.</p><p>“Yes, your majesty,” he said, finally looking up with an impish grin that was more annoying than charming.</p><p>Agatha had been thinking about this for a while now. She knew Billy was more than capable, yet some part of her still viewed him as a “green” teen. But she couldn’t fuss over him forever; she had to let him leave the nest and become what he was supposed to become. She had to trust him to do right by her. Intellectually, Agatha knew she could trust Billy, and that he wouldn’t let her down, but it didn’t mean it was easy for her. Giving up control had never been easy for her because control was the only thing that she had left. Or so she had been thinking for many, many years. It was terrifying, this loosening of her grip on everything she had built around herself like a fortress. But maybe that was the point. Maybe the walls had served their purpose, and it was time to open the gate.</p><p>“Tell me everything there is to know about Mrs. Hart,” she prompted, leaning back in her chair and folding her arms in front of her.</p><p>Billy’s eyebrows flew up, followed by a slight frown. He knew better than to ask Agatha questions, however. “Sharon Hart Davis, seventy-four, born in Pasadena, California,” he started listing the facts in a monotone voice. “Graduated from UC San Diego in nineteen-seventy-seven, majored in history. Met her husband Todd during her senior year, and got married after being together for three years. Have been married until death parted them in twenty-twenty-three. One child—daughter Heather, forty-eight.” He looked at Agatha as if checking whether she had any comments so far. She didn’t, and gestured for him to continue. “Mrs. Davis resides in NYC and is the founder of a florist brand, The Green Thumb. Her company is the main caterer for this city’s major events during the awards’ season, Broadway and movie premieres, and private functions. Her public appearances are usually uneventful; she keeps to herself and has zero dirty laundry.” He finished, looking at Agatha expectantly. He didn’t miss one bit, not that Agatha doubted him.</p><p>“She is your account now,” she simply said.</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened. “Are you serious?” His voice pitched a little higher, the way it always did when he was overwhelmed with excitement.</p><p>“Yes. You had been ready years ago. We will start with my old-time clients who wouldn’t mind the transition. Simple accounts first—no drama. And once you’re more comfortable, we will start adding up.” </p><p>Billy looked at her carefully, analyzing every change in her expression. She could see it in his eyes: the gratitude, the disbelief, the fierce loyalty. “Please don’t take this for me being ungrateful, because I’m obviously thrilled, and will likely scream and jump after I leave your office, kicking my feet and being cringe. It will actually be very embarrassing, so please never replay that footage. But...” he hesitated for a split second. “Are you okay, Agatha?”</p><p>She exhaled, slow and heavy, her fingers brushing against the fabric of her sleeve as if she could find the words tucked somewhere there. “Do you want an honest answer?” Maybe it was time. Maybe it was time to loosen the iron bands around her own heart. To stop pretending she could bear the weight of everything alone, and begin letting those close to her in. Maybe Rio had ignited that in her—believing in other people, believing they would not let her down.</p><p>Billy’s face softened in an instant, all the bravado dropping away to reveal the boy who was hiding behind the professional mask—the boy who had always cared deeply about her. His hands twitched slightly, and when he spoke, his voice was small, almost breaking, “Yes. Please tell me what it is, no matter how bad it is.” He swallowed hard. “You’ve been… different. As if you’re reflecting on your life, like you’re preparing for something…” He trailed off.</p><p>It hovered between them, unspoken but unbearably loud. The air felt thinner for a moment. Agatha stared at him, feeling the sudden tightness in her throat, the aching swell of guilt. She hadn’t realized he was worried. A brittle laugh cracked out of her before she could stop it. Light, unexpected. Billy flinched at the sound, his head jerking up in alarm—staring at her like she was something wondrous and terrifying all at once. Right…he’d never seen her ever producing this kind of sound before. “I’m fine,” she said, more gently this time, smoothing the words over the ragged edges inside her. “I just think…” She hesitated, the truth suddenly so raw it almost hurt. “I think it’s time I start making time for myself.” It felt strange to say it out loud, like she was trying on a new skin. “And it’s time for you to become the true you—to shine.”</p><p>Billy blinked rapidly, visibly grappling with the flood of emotion behind her words. He nodded, biting his lip, and for a moment, he just looked at her as if memorizing her face in case she changed again. Then, tentatively, he teased, “Having Rio around looks good on you.”</p><p>Agatha felt the reaction before she could stop it: a flutter in her chest, a warmth spreading up the back of her neck. She lifted a sharp brow, but there was no real heat behind it, and she knew that he could see the betrayal of a smile fighting at the corners of her mouth. “We are just talking,” she said dryly. But the words didn’t have their usual armor. They felt soft, exposed.</p><p>Billy shrugged with a lopsided, knowing smile. “It’s good to have someone to talk to,” he said, his voice dropping to something almost reverent.</p><p>Agatha looked away, feeling a strange, frightening tenderness swelling inside her chest. It was good. Good in a way that slipped past every wall she’d built. Good in a way that terrified her, because she knew—once she let herself want it—she would never be able to go back to being alone. For a long moment, she just breathed, letting the realization settle into her bones. And for once, she didn’t push it away.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>The Festival of Lights took place every year and was held at Bryant Park in New York City. It was a seven-day celebration of Lunar New Year at the end of January, the beginning of February, with an enormous street fair, carnival, and a live music show on the final day. There were several charity auctions held during the day, all imaginable social activities, and even a petting zoo. Everyone who was anyone wanted to be a part of it, be it just an ad in social media, or direct participation—that event was extremely valuable for reputation. So it wasn’t surprising that almost two dozen of Agatha’s active clients were honorable guests of the festival, making her a low-key curator of the event.</p><p>Most of the time, everything worked passively without her direct involvement; that’s how well-attuned her enterprise had been. Everyone knew their lines, everyone knew what to do, and Agatha only needed to check in once in a while to make sure nobody strayed from the path, which, thanks to modern technology, was possible remotely. She, however, did make a quick appearance on the final day of the festival, just to pay respects.</p><p>That’s exactly how she found herself roaming the busy aisles of the fair, making her way toward the main entrance, phone in hand, and already pulling up Uber. Mrs. Hart drove them here earlier today, and after what felt like ages of mundane mingling, Agatha was ready to go home. It was still early, not even four in the afternoon, but it was quite chilly, and her feet were killing her after walking nonstop booth-to-booth since noon. The cold gnawed through her tall, navy coat, each gust of wind slicing like a thin, cruel blade against her skin, and still she pushed forward, weaving through clusters of strangers who felt suddenly too loud, too close. She loved the coat; it made her look powerful. Yet, right now, it felt like a poor choice of clothing for the day—she didn't realize how cold it was, and she had to be outside for almost the entire day. Agatha was pretty tired, the kind of tired that soaked deep into her bones and made the world blur at the edges, but the prospect of going home now and catching Rio at the beginning of her “shift” stirred something within her. Something that was not fatigue at all, but a restless, golden flutter, a yearning so sweet it ached. It would be nice to spend the entire evening with her, and maybe if Agatha felt bold enough, she would even ask her to stay for dinner.</p><p>They had fallen into those new dynamics with ease—at first, Agatha would come home early a couple times a week, they would talk a little, but with every new day, Rio lingered longer. Their conversations were becoming deeper, braided with shy smiles, lingering silences that pulsed with unspoken things, and the kind of trust that felt reckless and vital all at once. And very soon, two random nights a week turned into set-in-stone Wednesday, occasional Friday, and always a Sunday. Always. Like a promise she had never dared to ask for but was somehow being given.</p><p>Agatha was not dumb. She acknowledged precisely what was happening. Rio, somehow, paved her way into her perfectly scheduled life and managed to set a permanent camp there. She was making Agatha break her habits and change her point of view on things she thought she knew to a T. It was subtle and gentle, not rough and demanding like Wanda, not pressing and pushing like Jen—it felt nice, felt natural. It slipped under her skin without resistance, reshaping her from within, not through force, but through its unbearable kindness. And Agatha realized then that she really didn’t mind the change; it was making her into this new version of herself that wasn’t quite bad. In fact, Agatha had to admit, she liked this woman—a woman who laughed a little softer, who lingered at windows just to watch the snow fall, and the sun shine, who sometimes caught herself smiling at nothing at all.</p><p>So, she stopped working on Sundays altogether. A decision that would have horrified the Agatha from three months ago—structured, ruthless, untouchable. And Rio… with no previously discussed arrangement, just started coming over in time for lunch, knowing that Agatha was home. No grand declarations, no contracts signed. Just presence. As if it were the most natural thing in the world. As if it had always been meant to happen. It was always casual—Rio would claim that she had a complicated meal planned that required more time. And sometimes it did, indeed, require some extra time to prepare. But most of the time, it didn’t. Agatha noticed, of course, but never said anything, because why would she? And most of the time, they would end up having lunch <em> and </em> dinner that day. And somehow Sundays became their date-non-date days. It wasn’t anything like a date, but it felt more than an ordinary day at the same time—sacred, slow days stitched together by laughter, shared silences, <em> accidental </em>brushes of fingertips, the low hum of something inevitable between them, the slow building of something vast and bright and terrifying in its tenderness. Agatha was going through the entire week, anticipating Sunday—that was the only thing that could help her push through the toughest days. The thought of it—a quiet table set for two, the sound of Rio’s voice filling the empty corners of the house, the smell of something warm drifting from the kitchen—was the thread she clung to, her anchor against the dark tides that sometimes still threatened to pull her under. But somewhere deep inside her, a tiny, rebellious hope had taken root. That maybe, just maybe, some days didn’t have to be survived. Some days could simply be lived.</p><p>Agatha was moving through the crowd with practiced ease, gracefully skipping the obstacles in the form of distracted, half-sober people and enthusiastic, running children. She was focused on her screen, trying to make her frozen fingers respond to her commands, when someone suddenly emerged from around the corner, and she had no time to maneuver and avoid the collision. Street fairs and open-air festivals were always like that—people were too excited to pay attention to where they were going. Agatha was not going to start a fight over something so irrelevant as that; in fact, she was not even going to acknowledge that in any way. She would just continue on her mission of ordering an Uber, not looking up or replying to an apology. Only an apology never came. What did come instead were steady hands on her arms. <em> Who the fuck had the audacity? </em>—</p><p>“Your coat, while absolutely bewitching, does not look very proper for this weather.” Rio’s hands were gently feeling the material of the coat, her fingers brushing over the fabric like she was trying to memorize it. Her voice was soft—too soft for the chaotic setting they were currently in, almost as if she were whispering directly into Agatha’s bloodstream. There was a hush in it, something sacred that didn’t belong to the clamor of crowds.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot up, and there she was—Rio, grinning with that awestruck, effortless joy that made Agatha feel both furious and breathless. Her eyes were sparkling like she’d just won something, and Agatha could not, for the life of her, understand how someone could stay that happy all the damn time. Rio was wearing a plain, black beanie with a tiny, golden Star Trek insignia embroidered on one side, a massive dark-purple scarf, and a thick, black bomber jacket. Her makeup was full force today—smokey eyes and expressive eyebrows, bold and disarming, something that belonged in a photoshoot, not here, pressed into the crowd. Agatha hated how stunning she was. Well, she loved it. But she hated how much her chest tightened just by looking at her. And she hated the thought—bright and acidic—that women had probably been hitting on her all day. Not that she cared. Obviously. Why would she care? She did not care. She felt it like an ache behind her ribs. She sensed Rio’s grip loosen on her arms and fought against her disappointment. “Hi,” she added softly, like it was an answer to something unspoken.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked open like glass. “Hi,” she echoed, and her lips curved before she could stop them. She could’ve sworn Rio’s smiles were contagious. “What are you doing here?” That was a pretty stupid question to ask because it was the last day of the festival, and everyone was here, the entire city was here.</p><p>“Making food,” she replied as it was obvious. “We’ve been one of the official food vendors for the festival for years now.”</p><p>“It is good publicity, brings new customers,” Agatha pointed out, her voice still wearing the crisp edge of her work persona like a suit she couldn’t quite shrug off.</p><p>Rio’s gaze was amused. Her head tilted, and her smile deepened, like she could see straight through all of Agatha’s armor, “I just like feeding people, Agatha.” And the way she was always saying her name like that was doing something to Agatha on a primal level. Each syllable was held with care, like it was something rare and delicious. Before she could collect herself enough to respond, Rio was already speaking again. “Don’t worry, I’m finishing up here and going to yours in a few,” she said, so breezily, as if that were just a normal sentence and not something that sent a lightning bolt of warmth through Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Her first impulse was to offer to ride to the penthouse together—it made sense since she was going there too, but then she realized something—an insight cracked through the routine like sunlight through clouds. She’d had Rio all to herself lately, safe behind closed doors, tucked into the golden cocoon of their shared hours. She’d grown used to it. Addicted to it. But this—this was different. This was public. And she realized she wanted to be seen by her side. It was an unexpected need, dyed in possessiveness. It felt raw and a little desperate. She just wanted all these people, who clearly had eyes for Rio, to know that Rio was with <em> her </em>. She wanted them to see that Agatha was the center of her attention. Okay, maybe she did care just a little bit.</p><p>“Or we could stay here?” she offered, too quickly. Then steadied herself. “How about a day off?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly in disbelief and sparked with excitement, “You want to stay here? With me?” <em> God, yes. </em></p><p>Agatha wanted so badly to touch her, to grab her hand gently in her own, and give it a little reassuring squeeze. “I mean,” she said, trying to maintain her carefully casual tone, and not to make a big deal out of it, “we are already here, and since you’re a food vendor, at least <em> some </em> of the food is… <em> proper </em>.” She saw the spark in Rio’s eyes before the chuckle escaped her lips. Agatha felt the sound like a drop of water in the middle of a drought. She was absolutely and totally and completely captivated by Rio’s chuckles. She wanted to make her chuckle all the time, and she wanted to be the only one to make her chuckle. And maybe she wanted her to make some other sounds. Not that she would ever admit it, of course.</p><p>It was late noon on the final day of the festival, so most of the activities began slowly wrapping up. The carnival and street fair were still in full swing—people losing at rigged games, clutching horrendous stuffed animals that barely resembled creatures, sipping glühwein, arguing with vendors over trinkets no one needed. There was something about the energy of those street fairs that was unlike anything—something almost magical. Only in New York could one find something as chaotic and unnecessary, yet pleasant and joyful as the Festival of Lights. Agatha had always loved it. So, it really didn’t matter to her what they would do if they stayed as long as she was with Rio.</p><p>“Have you eaten?” Rio narrowed her eyes as if she could read the contents of Agatha’s stomach just by looking at her. That was a simple question, yet Agatha tensed a little. Because she had not eaten anything. Because she had been busy all morning, and then came here. She’s been making rounds, engaging in social interactions—working.</p><p>“I had the shake in the morning,” she confessed quietly. The shake had become a staple in her fridge after the day she and Rio spent together when she got sick. She never asked for it; she never paid for it. She only admitted that she loved it, and back then, when Rio said she was sure there was a way for her to have it every day, Agatha thought she was flirting. However, she discovered the next morning that Rio had actually left a fresh shaker in her fridge. And then the morning after that. And then the morning after that, too. And it simply became a thing. Agatha remembered what Rio had said then—shake is not a meal replacement, so she braced herself for some nagging that she usually would get from other people in her life.</p><p>Instead, Rio just softly said, “Okay.”<em> Okay. Okay? That was it? That was all she had to say? No comments on Agatha’s poor nutrition choices? No lectures? No passive-aggressive jokes wrapped in sugar? Well </em>… perhaps Rio didn’t really care that much, after all. But before she could go deeper in her spiral, Rio reached her wrist. She hesitated mid-air, and it was clear that she wanted to take her hand, but instead she loosely hooked her finger in the crease of the fabric where the sleeve was folded, and tugged ever so gently. “Come on,” she said, her tone soft and carrying, but it cut through the noise of the festival. “Let’s feed her majesty.” Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, releasing the butterflies in her stomach. It was not because of the title, but the fact that Rio remembered.</p><p>She had, of course, told Rio about how Billy was calling her. However, she only mentioned it in passing while complaining about how annoying he was. Rio had chuckled at that then, saying it was somehow very fitting. They’ve never revisited the subject since. Yet, apparently, Rio remembered because, of course, she did. Because Rio remembered everything about Agatha, even the things Agatha herself thought unimportant. It was as if Rio was starved for any piece of information Agatha let slip, every fragment of herself she accidentally shared, Rio neatly stored it in the drawers of her memory without sorting it into important or non-important categories because, apparently, everything Agatha told her deserved to be labeled as important. And Agatha didn’t know what to do with that. Nobody had ever paid her that much undivided attention without asking anything in return.</p><p>They had now come to a trailer behind the food booth. “I would like it if you waited inside while I get the food,’ Rio said. ‘It’s quite cold, and your coat is pretty thin.” She then opened the door and waited. Agatha didn’t get it at first; she just stood there, staring at Rio until she gestured with the tilt of her head and a smile. <em> Oh. </em> Somehow, Rio had this ability to stun Agatha and leave her speechless with just a simple gesture—it worked like a charm every single time. When Agatha crossed the threshold, she was met with warm air and a faint aroma of sandalwood. The corners of her lips twitched—Rio was leaving traces of herself wherever she went. </p><p>“Would you like something specific to eat?” Rio asked her quietly. She stopped her with a hand on her shoulder, and when Agatha turned her head slightly to ask, Rio grabbed her coat by the shoulders and pulled it lightly. <em> Oh</em>. Agatha let her slide it off of her. She was watching Rio hanging it by the door <em> , </em> transfixed. When she was done, she simply walked toward Agtha, grabbing the sleeve of her blazer the same way she did earlier with the coat, and guided her to the small sofa by the wall. “So, food?” she asked again. And, <em> yes, food, </em>Agatha had already forgotten what they were doing.</p><p>She shook her head and murmured just as quietly, “Anything is fine, if you’re the one cooking.” Rio grinned.</p><p>They were existing in that quiet space of a warm trailer, just hovering, present, when Agatha heard the slide door between the tiny trailer rooms move. “I told you people countless times to stop bringing your carny hook-ups to the office.” The voice was high and bright, it belonged to someone used to being obeyed—Agatha could smell power from miles away. When the woman emerged from the doorway and saw them, she smiled. </p><p>“It’s just me,” Rio said, laughing quietly.</p><p>The woman looked at her, then looked at Agatha, then looked at Rio again. “Didn’t think I needed to tell <em> you </em>that,” she said, arching her eyebrow.</p><p>“You don’t,” Rio replied, “Lilia, this is Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>She extended her arm, going for a handshake. “Lilia Calderu. Your emails are the best worded correspondence I’ve received in centuries,” she said, her tone friendly.</p><p>‘So, I’ve been told,” replied Agatha, shaking her hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Calderu.”</p><p>“Likewise,” she said, wincing playfully, “please call me Lilia.” She turned to Rio then and asked whether they were staying. “Well, I’m going to leave you to it, then. Lock up?” Rio nodded and gave her a thumbs-up. Lilia slipped into her coat then and reached for the door. “Have fun, kids. Use protection,” she said with a smirk before vanishing into the outside chaos.</p><p>That was not even the protection joke that got Agatha—though it <em> did </em> get her, but the kids part hit harder. For the first time in many, many years, Agatha caught herself actually feeling young. Maybe it was the energy of the festival, maybe it was because she was at the festival with Rio, who was always cheerful about even the most mundane things in life, or maybe it was because of the way Lilia addressed them, implying that they were going to do something reckless and stupid. The reasoning didn’t matter after all. What mattered was that at this moment, Agatha didn’t think of her age, or baggage, or anything that usually held her off—she just existed in the moment, and she was enjoying this moment. She was enjoying the way Rio’s fingers felt where they were grazing her skin under the sleeve of her blazer, while she guided her to the sofa. She was enjoying the tender look Rio was giving her, saying that she would be back in less than five minutes. She was enjoying that warmth that was spreading within her at the thought of spending the entire evening with Rio. And she wouldn’t lie, she was enjoying Lilia’s implication earlier that there was something between them. Even though there actually wasn’t, for some reason, it affected Agatha—the thought of people seeing them like that.</p><p>When Agatha took the first bite of the taco, she couldn’t help the shameless moan that escaped her throat. “Oh, my god!” she covered her mouth with her palm, still chewing while talking. “What is in this?” It tasted amazing, just like anything Rio made, but tacos… Agatha was sceptical about them when Rio returned and gave her the plate. She was not the biggest fan of tacos,  but to be fair, Agatha was not the biggest fan of food, period. Yet, she’s been eating a lot of different foods lately and enjoying it, too. She supposed that was just a Rio effect—she was making her reevaluate a lot of her views on different things in life. And apparently, tacos were now on that list, because goddammit, those were making her jaw spasm. Was a mouth orgasm a thing? It should absolutely be a thing.</p><p>Rio grinned, clearly very pleased that Agatha was enjoying the food. “It’s my secret-sauce tofu—’ she said. Agatha grimaced. <em> Tofu? She was voluntarily eating tofu without being tortured into it? </em> That woman… “—mixed with egg whites, shredded chicken breast, cheese, a ton of seasoning, and your favorite—vegetables.” Agatha stared at the taco like it had personally betrayed her. Three months ago, she wouldn’t have gone near that ingredient list.</p><p>“I don’t care how many vegetables there are in here if it tastes this good,” she said, taking another bite and closing her eyes. “I want to have this for lunch every day.’</p><p>“Okay,” Rio simply replied. It was soft and quiet while her eyes were sparkling with joy.</p><p>“Rio, wait… no,” Agatha swallowed her mouthful, smiling now. “I was just joking.”</p><p>“I never joke about food," she said just as softly as before. “And I don’t want to ever joke about you.” <em> Oh</em>.</p><p>They had only just stepped into the crowded fairgrounds when Rio stopped abruptly, as though struck by a thought. Agatha frowned. Nothing had happened—they’d been walking in a comfortable silence since leaving the trailer three minutes ago—yet Rio was suddenly still, her expression unreadable. That calculating look returned, the one that made Agatha feel like she was being carefully assessed. She could almost hear the gears turning behind those brown eyes.</p><p>Then, just as quickly, Rio smiled. She reached for her oversized scarf, unwrapping it from around her neck in a few practiced motions. Stepping in closer, she placed it gently around Agatha’s shoulders. It was still warm from the heat of her body, and it smelled like her—woody, spicy, grounding. Agatha swallowed hard. She didn’t dare move, didn’t breathe, barely blinked, just stood there transfixed while Rio wrapped the scarf snugly around her neck, careful and tender, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.</p><p>“Now, you’re ready to enjoy the night,” Rio finally said, taking a step back and admiring her work, and Agatha was suddenly very warm and not because of the scarf.</p><p>They started walking again—no particular destination, just wandering the tiny streets of the fair, watching people.</p><p>“I don’t hate vegetables, you know,” Agatha suddenly said. ”Despite the popular assumption.” Rio hummed in acknowledgement, but didn’t say anything. She looked at Agatha, indicating that she was paying attention. “I just don’t find them convenient for my lifestyle,” she continued. She didn’t know where that urge to share came from. Perhaps it was prompted by the way most of the fair vendors knew Rio by name, greeting her with warm familiarity and tossing her easy, harmless questions every time they passed a stall. Or maybe it was the way women looked at Rio—hungry, curious, like they wanted to memorize her. Or maybe it was simply overdue. Agatha didn’t know. What she did know, however—what pulsed louder than her rational mind—was that she needed to draw Rio’s full attention. Not that she was jealous or anything of that nature, of course. </p><p>“I work all the time, so when I finally get to eat something, I’d like it to be as sustainable as possible—enough calories to last me until dinner, and preferably easy to consume. Vegetables are just… Too much unnecessary chewing for that little energy they provide—not worth it.” Her tone was quiet and measured. Agatha wasn’t trying to justify anything; she genuinely wanted Rio to understand her better. “I can’t waste time on something like eating. It’s too much… idling,” she added, softer now, barely audible. Like a confession pulled out from beneath a thousand well-defended layers. She knew what usually came after that—concerned looks, overly sweet voices, unsolicited advice cloaked in clinical language. People trying to care in ways that felt more like condescension than kindness, informing her that she was suffering from an eating disorder and needed professional help. <em> Ugh, people </em>. But it was fine, she supposed—if Rio wanted to toss in one more of those remarks, she’d take it. If it brought them a step closer, she’d survive it. Because Agatha needed to know if this woman was truly paying attention. If she was interested. Really interested. And what better way to test it than to lay a crack in the armor and see if Rio stepped closer or walked away.</p><p>Rio didn’t walk away. Rio was listening, absorbing that new information without commenting or interrupting, without arguing or giving care advice. No criticism ever came. What came instead was a soft “I know.”<em> How could she possibly know?</em> They had never talked about it. She narrowed her eyes, trying to understand. “You take Movement is Life quite literally,” Rio finally said, her voice warm with something close to fondness. A soft smile curled at her lips. Not mocking. Not patronizing. But… touched. And that made Agatha want to scream. Or cry. Or both. <em>Why was she smiling like that? </em>It was as if she found this deeply broken, maladaptive thing about Agatha endearing. Like it made her more understandable, not less. Like she wasn’t a problem to be solved. <em>What was wrong with this woman?</em></p><p>Agatha frowned, overwhelmed. “What, you’re not going to ask how I got this way?” she asked before she could stop herself. No judging remarks? No concern? Not even basic nosiness? Nothing?</p><p>“No,” Rio simply replied, her tone steady and unshaken. “If you ever feel ready to share your traumas with me, I will be honored to have that trust. And if you prefer to keep it to yourself, this is okay, too.” <em> How? How was Rio doing that? </em> “I just need you to remember that my offer to keep you safe from your demons will always stand,” she added, her tone so tender that Agatha wanted to cry.<br/>She didn’t know what to say to that. She had never found herself in a similar social situation where another person, not to mention a person she was attracted to, would treat her with so much kindness and understanding. Now, <em> that </em> was real <em> care </em>right there, and not that socially pre-approved nonsense.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered. That was all she could manage. <em> Okay </em>. Was there a manual for Rio that she could borrow somewhere? Because she desperately needed one. It was quite ironic, actually. Her entire life, Agatha loathed the standards, the scripted socially appropriate replies, the models of social situations, the rehearsed reactions, and emotional algorithms that defined most human interaction. She had been praying to find someone different, someone whose hands were not tied by the invisible etiquette that strangled real connection. But Agatha was not delusional; she knew that such a person likely didn’t exist because no matter how outside of the box one thinks, the society creeps into their bloodstream passively, making an impact—there was no way avoiding that. Even Agatha sometimes found herself succumbing to the “appropriate” notion because sometimes it was just an easy road, sometimes it wasn’t worth it to fight. The sad reality of existence—nobody was really free or had free will. So, it was quite ironic, that she had finally, by some cosmic miracle, found such person, and now she had absolutely no fucking clue what to do with that. </p><p>“Okay,” Rio mirrored her reply. She had been maintaining eye contact ever since Agatha started talking, her eyes focused and steady. Something sparkled in it. Then her attention shifted, lighting up with sudden delight. Agatha followed her line of sight and saw it: the basketball game booth. “Come on,” Rio reached for her hand, but didn’t take it to Agatha’s utter disappointment. “Let’s throw some hoops.”</p><p>She laughed, “These games are rigged.”</p><p>“The world is rigged, Agatha,” Rio replied, a playful tilt in her voice, “doesn’t have to mean you can’t learn how to navigate it in your favor.” Agatha wasn’t sure what she was talking about, and as if sensing it, Rio added, “Everything has a system—a code. Rigged or not, things still follow patterns. If you look close enough, you’ll see it. And once you learn to read that code, you can bend it. Interact with it however you need to.” She smiled then, it was warm and inviting. “I’ll show you,” she said, already pulling out some cash to pay for the round. Agatha was intrigued because there was no way this poetic thinking could be actually applied to a very real, very intentionally misshapen hoop.</p><p>The booth attendant, of course, knew Rio. Called her by name. Was <em> far </em> too enthusiastic. Leaned too close. Touched her arm like they were old friends—or more. Agatha’s blood boiled. It was not jealousy. Absolutely not. She was simply observing—protectively, of course. She was just making sure this girl respected boundaries. That was all. But Rio didn’t seem to notice; she just grabbed a ball and jogged to the throwing line, turning her head and smiling at Agatha.</p><p>The first throw was a miss, and <em> the booth-girl </em> was cheering enthusiastically. She said something Agatha didn’t catch because her ears were ringing with irrational, furious static. Rio, however, was not paying the girl any mind—Her expression turned serious. Focused. She narrowed her eyes and stared down the hoop like she was casting a spell. Her breathing slowed. Her shoulders relaxed. She tilted her head slightly and extended one arm as if visualizing the trajectory in her mind. And then she smiled, wide, lazy, and confident. She turned to Agatha and asked, “Ready?” She didn’t have any time to reply because the next thing she knew, Rio threw a ball, and it went straight through the hoop, clean and easy. <em> The booth-girl </em> started cheering again, but Agatha barely heard her, captivated by Rio’s pinning focus on the hoop—she was hypnotizing it, not looking away for even a second. Another ball went through, and then another one, and then the one after that. </p><p>She scored nine out of ten, winning the first prize, which turned out to be a medium-sized plushie bunny. Surprisingly, it wasn’t hideous. <em> The booth-girl’s </em>enthusiasm dimmed instantly as soon as Rio took it and turned on her heel toward Agatha, beaming. She was holding the bunny in front of her with so much care that one would reserve for a baby. “Señor Scratchy,” Rio said solemnly, “this is Agatha. Your job is to make sure she doesn’t forget to be kinder to herself, and to remind her that she is safe.” She turned to face the bunny again, and added, quieter now as if only for him to hear, “Be there for her when I'm not around, okay?” She then pressed his artificial fur into Agatha’s hands gently, and she had no choice but to take him, not that she would’ve considered not to. It was ridiculous. It was sweet. Rio was sweet. Agatha smiled, small and involuntary, and clutched the bunny to her chest like it might shield her from the fact that she was falling—fast and hard.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>The night drifted on with them lazily roaming the fairgrounds, talking about nothing, orbiting each other like it was the most natural thing in the world. And it <em> was </em> easy—being around Rio. She wasn’t pushing, wasn’t asking for anything; it was obvious the only thing she wanted was to be near Agatha. That was it. Just her presence. She listened carefully to every story Agatha told, even the ridiculous ones, the mean ones, and laughed like she found Agatha’s bite endearing. Cute, even. It threw Agatha off. She was used to people low-key judging her, telling her she ought to be nicer, more understanding, that she should try not to alienate everyone in a ten-foot radius. But how was that fair, when <em> everyone </em> was either irritating, incompetent, or actively making her job impossible? Rio, on the contrary, seemed to encourage her behavior, which also put her in a slight cognitive dissonance since Rio was the sweetest person she knew. But it wasn’t fake—Agatha could tell that Rio genuinely didn’t think her way of living was wrong. So, yeah. Being with her felt… easy. Natural. Like something essential had clicked into place. Like they’d always been meant to fit together—two halves of a whole.</p><p>They were strolling past the food court alley when someone called Rio’s name. Agatha bristled—<em>ugh, not again</em>—but when she turned, she realized it was just a boy from Rio’s booth, holding out treats. Marshmallow-meringue squares. Her heart clenched. It was faint now—muted by years—but it would never fully leave her. The treat was simple: cereal crisps folded into melted marshmallow, hardened, and topped with tiny meringue swirls. A sugar-coma delight.</p><p>When Rio passed her one with a smile, but instead of an echo smile, she got a narrowed, suspicious gaze, she frowned slightly. “These are not what they look,” she said urgently, “I made them—there’s no added sugars, and the cereal base has protein in it.” Of course, Rio had found a way to make a healthier equivalent of a sinful treat—that made Agatha chuckle softly.</p><p>“Sneaking in better choices to the public, I see,” she said playfully. She knew RIo could see her deflecting; she had that ability to see right through Agatha, or so it seemed. And so… <em> here goes nothing </em>. “These were my son’s favorite treats,” she merely whispered, trying to maintain eye contact. She saw the surprise flash in Rio’s eyes. “He died when I was twenty-seven,” she added, bracing herself to receive that scripted empathy, a socially approved condolence, or whatever other crap people were supposed to say in these kinds of models of behavior. But none of that came. Rio’s gaze was steady and bright on her—the same as usual, nothing changed.</p><p>“How old was he?” she asked, and there was no pity in her tone; her voice was gentle but clear. That made Agatha exhale in relief, her shoulders momentarily unclenched. </p><p>“Six,” she said quietly. She never talked about Nicky with people, not because it hurt—it still did, but it was her background now, something she learned to live around—but because she didn’t want to create that social situation for either of them. She hated the way people looked at her after she said it. Like it changed her. Broke her into a tragic woman. Jen knew, because Jen knew most things about her, because Jen was the only person in her life whom she could tolerate. She also was not easily shaken by anything. Billy knew, but only the surface, the bare facts—his name was Nicky, he died when he was six—nothing more than that. He never asked follow-up questions.</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, absorbing the information. Agatha didn’t know what she was expecting, but what she got instead was not it. Rio looked at her with that same observant calm and asked, “Does Billy remind you of him?”<em> Oh </em>.</p><p>She had to blink a couple of times to get herself in the present moment—the moment where she was not receiving bullshit in reply. “All the time,” she said with a ghost of a smile.</p><p>Rio grinned, tilting her head. “So, <em> the </em> Agatha Harkness has feelings? How outrageous.” Agatha wanted to scream in disbelief. Fuck clichés but that was literally the first time ever when she felt good opening up about her past. Rio was making her share more—she was making her feel safe.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha smirked, slipping easily into flirtation, “I’m only human.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio smirked, raising her eyebrows, eyes gleaming, “I thought you were a vampire.” <em> Fuck me </em> , Agatha thought, somewhere between delighted and unhinged. She <em> needed </em> to scream.  </p><p>And just like that, Rio knew one of her deepest wounds—one of the roots of the whole damn mess that was her life. And she didn’t shrink from it. Didn’t offer comfort she hadn’t asked for. She just received it. As if Agatha’s past didn’t make her fragile. As if it didn’t make her less<em> . </em>To say it felt fantastic would’ve been an understatement. </p><p>Agatha told her how much Nicky loved the festival. How his birthday always landed on that week, and how she’d turn it into a celebration weekend. Thursday night, they’d drive up, check in at the hotel, and go to some hideous New York City diner or a hole-in-the-wall. They would spend Friday at the festival, doing everything—rides, crafts, face-painting, games. Saturday, they’d leave before the show because Nicky never cared for it. And Sunday, there’d be a party at home, where he’d excitedly recount every detail, making his friends jealous and their parents exasperated with her.</p><p>Agatha told her how he always asked to make those treats at home, but Agatha had always put it off, telling him they could do it later. And then “later” never happened. And again—Rio didn’t offer her any <em> You did nothing wrong, </em> or <em> You could’ve never known </em> , or <em> You shouldn’t feel bad </em>, or anything of that nature. What she did offer instead was to make damn treats. She lit up and exclaimed enthusiastically, “These are very easy to make. We’re making them tomorrow. It’s Sunday, it’s perfect.”</p><p>And,<em> well, fuck, okay </em>. They were making Nicky’s favorite treats for his birthday two decades later. Better late than never, right? Agatha wanted to cry. Or kiss Rio. She undoubtedly wanted to kiss Rio.</p><p>They left the food alley and made their way down the main street. It was more crowded here, louder—people funneling toward the stage in waves, all vying for the best view. Agatha didn’t even know who the headliner was this year, but the air buzzed with anticipation, so she assumed it was someone important. Important to someone, at least.</p><p>“Rio!” a man’s voice cut through the busy buzzing. <em> Seriously? Men too? </em> But when Agatha turned, her guard dropped—just a little. It was another fair worker, an older man who was grinning at them kindly. “Last call on the Ferris Wheel before we give our girl a well-deserved rest. Fancy sharing your favorite locations with the lady?” He smiled at Agatha. And, <em> okay </em>, maybe he could live, maybe Agatha would spare him. She couldn’t help but notice the thrill she felt at being called Rio’s lady. She liked the implication. Liked it a lot.</p><p>Rio looked at her, her eyes bright and hopeful. “Would you like to?” And, honestly? Agatha would like to do literally anything with Rio as long as she was with Rio. And apparently, Rio was well aware of it because she was already grinning, hooking her finger in the crease of Agatha’s sleeve, but not moving further—waiting for Agatha’s response.</p><p>She chuckled lightly, “Yeah, okay.” She felt Rio tugging at the fabric of her coat then, guiding her toward the Ferris Wheel.</p><p>The fair attendant opened the small gate of the cabin, but didn’t move otherwise, letting Rio offer Agatha her hand to step into the gondola. It was starting to look more and more like a date with every passing second—and Agatha wasn’t even pretending to mind. She sat beside Rio in the little cabin, still wrapped in the other woman’s scarf, holding a ridiculous plush bunny to her chest. She felt twenty again.</p><p>She felt a movement behind her and struggled to suppress a smile. Rio’s arm was casually draped over the back of her seat. Smooth. Then came the soft, steady voice, narrating parts of the city visible from above: the arcade she liked, her favorite indie bookstore, her first gym, a tucked-away farmers’ market that sold artisan honey and small-batch soap. Her school. Her house. A no-name park where she liked to jog in the mornings. Each place was a breadcrumb. A glimpse. And Agatha found herself hungry for more. Each spot painted a clearer picture of Rio’s life—and made her ache to be included in it.</p><p>“And over there,” Rio said, pointing to a distant high-rise, “our headquarters. Top floor’s ours. We may have claimed the roof, too.” Agatha looked at the building and gasped in awe.</p><p>The entire surface of its roof was a large garden. Not a rooftop patio. Not potted decor. An actual <em> garden. </em> The perimeter was lined with real trees—some flowering, some small and shapely, others tall with layered canopies. Twinkling lights wove between raised flower beds and trellises, and there was a glass greenhouse structure on one side that caught the lights of the city like a gem. It wasn’t landscaped—it was created with love. She couldn’t see all the details from that far away, but somehow, Agatha just knew that it was Rio who created that small paradise in the middle of the concrete jungle. It wasn’t just a rooftop garden. It was a <em> sanctuary </em>. A secret world above the noise.</p><p>“This is so beautiful,” she murmured, voice catching in her throat. She turned her head and realized just how close Rio had gotten. Their faces were just inches away. Two breaths apart, if that. If Agatha leaned in just a little bit, their noses would touch. She studied Rio’s face—she wasn’t maintaining eye contact, for a change, because her eyes were instead glued down to Agatha’s lips. Her pulse jumped. She followed the line of Rio’s stare, her own breath faltering as she noticed the soft parting of Rio’s mouth, the subtle rise and fall of her chest. She smelled like something sweet, and Agatha wanted to inhale her. When she looked up again, Rio’s eyes were back on her face, her gaze so intense that Agatha felt hot all over. Rio’s pupils were blown wide, and she looked like she was going to do something reckless. <em> God </em>, Agatha wanted her to.</p><p>She didn’t know who leaned in first. It didn’t matter. What mattered was the heat coming off Rio’s skin, which Agatha could feel in every cell of her body. The way the hand that had rested behind her now pressed gently against her shoulder. <em> God </em> , it was criminal she was wearing a coat. She wanted to feel that touch <em> everywhere. </em>They were so close now; their lips were almost touching. But before either of them could take that final step and press them together, the gondola lurched and came to a jerking stop, swaying more than it should. The sound of screeching metal pierced the bubble, and they both jerked back instinctively, clutching the sides of the seats.</p><p>“Sorry about that, folks!” Agatha heard the fair attendant call from below. “Our old lady is a bit tired. Please, give her a moment.” </p><p>The blood was slowly coming back to her brain, her ears pulsing violently. Agatha realized that her hands were trembling, too. She looked at Rio and found a soft smile and tender gaze as if they didn’t just share an intense moment that completely broke Agatha’s equilibrium. She would’ve thought that perhaps it didn’t affect Rio and all, and that she didn’t care as much as Agatha did, but then she felt the warmth of her skin on the side of her face. Rio reached up and gently tucked a loose strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear, fingertips brushing the curve with aching tenderness. Her touch lingered. “You okay?” she asked softly.</p><p>Agatha gulped. No, she wasn’t fucking okay. She wanted to scream, to punch the nearest wall, or explode. Or maybe all three. “Yeah,” she whispered instead.</p><p>Before they had a chance to speak further, the Wheel squeaked once more and began to move again.</p><p>By the time they made it back to the fairgrounds, dusk had settled in. The alleys were thinning out, and people drifted toward the main stage as vendors began packing up. Agatha and Rio wandered with no particular direction, just existing near each other, talking, listening. The air buzzed with the energy of the festival’s final hours, and Agatha could feel it creeping in—laced with the sweetness of endings, enveloping her, and she didn’t want the night to end. She wasn’t ready to let Rio go yet, she wanted more. She was selfish, so what? Sue her.</p><p>“Do you want to stay for the show?” she tried to sound casual.</p><p>“Do you?” Rio asked a little too quickly. That was odd. Rio was not normally the one to dodge questions, it was usually Agatha. So, she felt her tensing right away.</p><p>Agatha tried to go for playful, without pushing too much. “I asked you first,” she said with a challenging smirk.</p><p>“I’m not a huge fan of modern music or loud noise, to be honest. Sorry.” Rio’s tone was controlled and even, and visually, she didn’t look any different, but Agatha could tell that the mood had switched. She disliked it.</p><p>“What are you apologizing for?” she asked, frowning slightly. Because, seriously, what was happening right now? How did they get from almost kissing five minutes ago to <em> this </em>?</p><p>Rio, who was usually so confident and unshaken, went on, “I’m aware this is rather an unpopular opinion. So, I’m sorry if you wanted to stay, but I’d rather we didn’t.” </p><p><em> Okay </em>. Agatha was no expert in feelings, but she knew this one. Also, Agatha was horrible at this—she didn’t know how to be that supportive partner. They were not even partners, but Agatha didn’t know how to be a partner either. How did Rio do that so effortlessly all the time? How could she make Agatha feel normal about her insecurities? She was the one insecure right now, and Agatha didn’t know what to do with that; she just knew she needed to do something. Rio had always been able to pull her out of her spirals just by being herself, just by talking to Agatha until she stopped drawing. Agatha didn’t know how to talk like that, but desperate times…</p><p>“When I first moved to NYC, I had to wear earplugs and shooting range muffs at home for almost a year,” she started, watching how Rio’s attention on her fidgety fingers slowly switched to her face. “That’s how everything around was just a terrible noise for me.” Rio was listening to her carefully, her head tilted a bit to the side, and her eyes scanning Agatha’s. Agatha took a deep breath, here goes nothing. “How would you know when someone finds your opinion popular if you keep feeling bad about it?” She wanted, desperately, to hold her hand. <em> Desperately </em>. Rio wasn’t saying anything; she just kept fidgeting, a little less now, though. And Agatha wanted to scream because her mind, her soul, her entire essence felt that urge to soothe the woman in front of her. “I may not be the most accomplished emotion interpreter in town,” Agatha tried for a joke, stealing a barely audible snort from Rio. She smiled, that was something, she’ll take it. “But I promise you, when there is something you need to apologize to me for—you will know.” She paused, and then, lowering her voice, warned, “I will make it well-known, trust me.”</p><p>Rio was absorbing her words like a sponge; she could see it in her eyes. Not waiting for an answer, Agatha finally went with her instincts and grabbed Rio’s hand possessively. She heard Rio’s breath catch in her throat, yet she didn’t jerk her hand free. “Let’s get out of here,” Agatha said firmly, turning on her heel and tagging Rio along. At first, she didn’t know where they were going; she just knew they had to <em> go </em>—somewhere quiet, somewhere not full of strangers and light and noise. This place served its purpose; they had a great time, but now it began feeling suffocating, and she needed to relocate them. They were on their way to the parking lot, Rio’s hand still clenched in Agatha’s, when it suddenly occurred to her that she hadn’t seen Rio eat anything except for a marshmallow treat. A quick glance at her watch confirmed they had some time.</p><p>“You spoil me with healthy homemade meals every night, but may I corrupt you with a greasy all-American burger? Just for tonight?” she turned to look at Rio.</p><p>And finally, finally, her bright eyes were looking back at her. “A night out at a traditional roadside diner?” she asked dreamily.</p><p>Agatha smiled and said quietly, as if not wanting to risk switching Rio’s mood again, “If you want it to be.”</p><p>“I do enjoy a greasy burger sometimes,” she confessed.</p><p>Agatha gasped theatrically, earning a chuckle, “Outrageous.”</p><p>She liked the image they created—RIo holding the doors open for her, gently guiding her to the booth with a hand on the small of her back. People around them probably had no doubt they were a couple. Agatha liked this. The diner wasn’t anything special—just another roadside mom-and-pop. It was designed to mimic the 50s with puffy seats, neon lights, and a jukebox in the corner. It was quite cozy. However, Agatha didn’t pay much attention to it or the food. Her focus was entirely on the woman across from her, dipping fries into her milkshake and then stuffing the soggy mess into her burger like it was a delicacy. It was ridiculous, and a little gross, and cute. For some reason, it made Rio so happy that Agatha didn’t even care how gross it looked.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha had to make peace with the fact that the night had to come to an end. She was climbing out of the passenger seat with Rio opening the door for her, offering her hand without a word. And Agatha hated to admit it, but her heart fluttered, and her stomach was full of butterflies. It was so stupid, the gesture was nothing special, they had shared far more intimate moments before, and yet…</p><p>She was lingering at the front door of her building, trying to read Rio’s expression. What was the protocol here? Agatha hated those, but in situations like this, she had to rely on something. Anything. She’s never done that before—dated someone she was crazy about. Not that they were dating, but semantics.</p><p>“Would you like to come up for tea?” she finally asked. <em> Tea? Seriously, Agatha? It was almost midnight, and you’re asking her to come up for tea? </em>She was an idiot.</p><p>Rio smiled, tender and warm—a smile Agatha’d learned was reserved only for her. “I would love nothing more, but it’s late, and today was…” she paused, looking for the right words. “Rich—so full of emotions,” she said. Agatha was glad to learn that today’s events affected Rio as well, and that she wasn’t the only one who felt that way. “I will see you tomorrow,” Rio smiled. “For now, let’s get some rest.”</p><p>Agatha was transfixed. She didn’t want to let Rio go. But at the same time, she wanted to fall asleep <em> immediately </em>—just to make tomorrow come faster, so she could see her again. “Okay,” she said quietly.</p><p>“Don’t stay up late, please?” Rio asked her hopefully. “Remember that Señor Scratchy is there for you,” she added, gently patting the bunny’s head.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha swore, she knew other words. Honest. She couldn’t remember any at that moment.</p><p>She looked at Rio taking a tentative step closer, and her breath caught in her throat. She didn’t dare move as Rio slowly leaned in and, without hesitation, pressed her soft lips to her cheek, a little too close to the corner of her mouth. And, lord have mercy on her worn soul, Rio’s lips were softer than she had imagined. She couldn’t move because if she did, she knew she would fist her stupidly sexy jacket and slam that ridiculously ripped body into hers, claiming every piece of her that her mouth could reach.</p><p>Rio lingered a little longer than considered friendly, her breath hot on Agatha’s skin. It was maddening. It was everything she’d ever wanted. “Good night, Agatha,” Rio whispered so close to her lips that they could as well just be kissing.</p><p>Agatha realized then that her eyes were closed. She opened them and looked at the woman in front of her. Rio’s eyes were wide open; she didn’t look like someone who had a very long, busy day. She looked alert and a little wild. Yet, the gentle care behind it made Agatha feel her bones melting away.</p><p>“Drive safe,” Agatha finally reached her cognitive ability to form coherent sentences that actually made sense. “I had a very good day today,” she whispered before she could change her mind.</p><p>Rio’s smile was radiant, and the energy that was coming from her sparkled like thousands of tiny fireworks. “I had a very good day today, too,” she whispered back.</p>

<p>Agatha crossed the threshold of her penthouse and leaned back against the door as it clicked shut behind her. She clutched the rabbit to her chest, her head falling back with a soft <em> thud </em>. A dazed, delighted smile played on her lips. Who was this woman—standing here in the dark, smiling like someone in love? She thought she’d buried this version of herself. But somehow—without force, without fanfare—Rio had found her again. Reached in and gently, impossibly, pulled her back into the world, and back to life. Only then did Agatha notice her scarf was still looped around her neck. She lifted it slowly and pressed it to her face—the faint scent of Rio’s perfume still clung to the fabric. Agatha inhaled, and her chest fluttered, her pulse quickening like it remembered something her mind wouldn’t say aloud.</p><p>She didn’t try to analyze it. Not tonight. Instead, she kept her promise and went straight to bed after a long, hot shower. Her mind didn’t spiral tonight. There were still things to confront—like the fact that Rio was technically still employed by her—but that could wait until morning. Because that question would inevitably drag her into another, deeper subject: Rio being far too young for her. Agatha wasn’t ready to go down that particular rabbit hole. Not tonight. Because tonight, for the first time in what felt like years, she didn’t feel like a burden or a bomb waiting to go off. Tonight, she felt at peace. And she wanted to keep it. She slipped beneath the covers and brought Scratchy with her, hugging him close to her chest. As the night's lullaby carried her into a dream-filled journey, she murmured something against his fur—that she would forget by morning—but it was gentle and intended for Rio.</p><p>She didn’t set her four-thirty alarm. She’d promised Rio she’d get some rest, and her promises to Rio had somehow become something non-negotiable. That should have been concerning and frightening—how easily the woman was slowly but surely changing her—but it hadn’t. It felt natural. Seamless, even. Rio was weaving herself into her life so gently, showing her—never telling, never forcing—how things could be different, where they could be adjusted. She never judged or told Agatha she was doing something wrong. She never pushed or demanded. She simply showed her how she was doing the same things, and most of the time, Agatha had to admit she saw the appeal. So, she had started following her lead. Little things. Softer ways. More gentle mornings. Fewer punishing nights. And she’d been surprised—genuinely, quietly surprised—by how much lighter everything felt. How much more room there was to breathe.</p><p>Agatha realized one day, without knowing exactly how it happened, she had come to the point in her life where she was no longer just tolerating the existence, surviving her life—she genuinely was enjoying the journey. She started wanting to live it. It didn’t feel like falling off a cliff as it used to. Now, it was more like standing on solid ground and realizing she didn’t want to walk it alone anymore.</p><p>Something had opened up between them—not shattered, just gently parted, like silk drawn aside to let the light in. And through that small, sacred opening, something warm began to seep through—soft and slow, but steady. A pulse of possibility. And Agatha, despite a lifetime of teaching herself not to feel certain things, not to want certain things, felt something unfamiliar begin to stir in her chest. Hope. It bloomed within her so quietly she almost missed it, delicate and golden. But it was there. Opening up to Rio hadn’t been the disaster she’d imagined. It hadn’t ended in judgment, or pity, or cold silence. In fact, it had been… nice. Liberating, even. To finally speak aloud the thoughts she’d buried for years, and to be met not with sympathy, but understanding. Real understanding. Rio didn’t coddle or recoil. She simply listened, the way a person does when they know something of the same pain. It was strange—new and utterly unfamiliar—but it felt good. Clean. Like a breath after being underwater for too long. So now they stood here, right on the edge of something. They could leave it at this—a rare and beautiful friendship, grounded in trust and mutual care. That would be enough.</p><p>Or—</p><p>She could try. She could step forward, reach for Rio, and see if she would reach for her, too. Maybe this wasn’t just in her head. Maybe Rio wanted something more—deep and intimate. It felt like she did.</p><p>The evening had a different weight to it tonight. Every moment shimmered with that strange clarity, like the air before a thunderstorm. Charged and inevitable. Tonight had felt like a date. It <em> was </em> a date, in every sense that mattered. Agatha could feel it in her bones—they were standing on a precipice, one quiet breath away from something irreversible. <em> God </em>, they needed to talk about things. They needed to talk about so many things Agatha had absolutely no fucking clue how to talk about. But they needed to resolve everything that was happening between them and decide which direction they were heading. And this time, it had to be Agatha, who was a brave little toaster, who did the talking because Rio had been reaching out this entire time. Despite how terrifying it seemed, Agatha had to take the leap, trusting Rio to catch her on the other side. And if Rio was not serious about this, if this was all just a passing crush for her, something fleeting and tender but not meant to last—then now was the moment to stop. Before it got too deep. Before Agatha gave too much. Because she had already started to feel things she was too scared to put into words. Now was not too late. If they stopped now, Agatha would survive. She took a long breath, deep and steady, and closed her eyes. That was enough thinking for the day.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Agatha had always liked Sundays. There was something distinct about the energy of the day—quiet but purposeful, like the world collectively exhaled. People went to church, or busy themselves with household chores, wandered grocery aisles, had family gatherings—it didn’t matter what they were doing because essentially it all led to that special vibe. For Agatha, Sundays had always belonged to Nicky. That was their day. They would always go out somewhere with an arcade, or burgers, or open-air activities, but there had to be burgers. Always burgers. That was their special meal, which they only got on Sundays together. That was their ritual. Agatha had never gotten burgers with anyone else.</p><p>Until last night. She hadn’t planned that; it just happened. One moment, she was trying to pull Rio out of her spiral, and the next thing she knew, she was dragging her away from the noise of the festival, wanting nothing more than to put her somewhere comfortable and safe. Burgers had always been <em> comfortable </em> and <em> safe </em>concepts in her mind. And so, Agatha took her out for burgers. It just felt right. Initially, she feared it would feel like a betrayal, as if she were violating the sacred ritual reserved only for her and Nicky. But it didn’t feel anything like that. Instead, it felt like a resurrection and amplification of previously conducted magic. As if the energy of the event had been picked up off the shelf, where it had been sitting in static for a long time—never forgotten, but not being used—cleansed of the dust it had collected over the years, breathed in new life, and filled with colorful, bright rays of new energy. It felt like a rebirth.</p><p>Agatha accepted the fact that the ritual was going to hold a new meaning from now on with an open heart and a tender smile. Rio appeared genuinely happy, sitting across from her in that booth, doing something absolutely vile to her burger, and Agatha found herself unable to look away. She never thought she’d want this again, but she did—a special person she would get burgers with every week. A special person, she would reserve Sundays for.</p><p>She was finishing up putting her makeup on—something light today. There was nowhere to be, nothing to conquer, nobody to intimidate, no need to impress. Just her and Rio. And Agatha wanted to look softer for her. Because that was how Rio was making her feel—softer. When she first realized that, she thought her system would reject it and fight against the change, but it never happened. That version of herself, the one who dared to be a little less sharp and guarded, had been allowed to live quietly behind the closed doors of her penthouse. Seen only by Rio. As she applied the last coat of mascara to her lashes, a soft knock came from her front door.</p><p>Despite having the key to the penthouse, Rio never used it on Sundays, saying it felt weird to open the door herself when Agatha was home. It didn’t feel weird; it felt domestic, intimate. Agatha wondered, not for the first time, if Rio felt it too, but didn’t know how to say it.</p><p>It was still early, not even eleven in the morning, but was Agatha going to complain about the prospect of spending more time with Rio? Of course, not. She opened the door to find Rio wearing the same bomber jacket from yesterday, unzipped now to reveal a ridiculous black t-shirt. At first, Agatha just registered the nerdy print and didn’t think much of it—Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Hawaiian shirts and floral swim trunks, laughing as Vader flipped burgers on a grill, helmet still on. It was absurd. It was cute. But then Rio shrugged off her jacket, and Agatha’s eyes caught the words written across the chest:</p><p>
<em> NOT THE BEST FATHER IN GALAXY </em>
</p><p>
<em> BUT TRYING </em>
</p><p>Agatha stared. A thousand thoughts went through her head, but before she could articulate any of them, Rio, as if sensing, pinched the fabric and said, “It’s your boy’s birthday, and we are cooking his favorite treats. I thought that was fitting.” Her tone was considerably lighter than the implication of that gesture.<em> The implication. </em> The implication that if Nicky were still here, Rio would’ve accepted him as her own. Agatha couldn’t breathe. That was… Was Agatha reading this wrong? Was there even another way to read that? <em> That. What the fuck was that? </em> She was completely motionless, frozen in the moment, her brain short-circuiting. They were not even together, or dating, or even talking about what was happening between them. And then, here was Rio, wearing that damn shirt with those damn burgers, on Nicky’s birthday, on a Sunday.</p><p>“Energy never dies, Agatha,” Rio said softly, interrupting her turmoil, breaking the silence without breaking the moment. “As long as we allow it to flow, they never truly leave us. We carry them within ourselves, with the only difference being that we can no longer reach out and touch them,” she said that like a truth, not a comfort. She was looking at Agatha with that careful precision, cataloguing her reactions. Always patient. Never pushing or demanding a reply. Always waiting for Agatha to collect her thoughts, to find her voice.</p><p><em> What the fuck was happening? How was Rio doing that? </em> How was she making Agatha feel as if she’d just been there twenty years ago, none of the damage would’ve spiraled so far out of control? That if Rio had existed in her life back then, she would’ve healed? She felt her mouth part, but no words came out. Overwhelmed would be an understatement. Yet, that was not a bad <em> overwhelmed </em>, but more like an awestruck.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what expression her face had at that moment, because the next thing she knew, Rio hesitated. Rio rarely hesitated. “Did I… overstep?” she sounded a bit uncertain, and her fingers began to fidget slightly. </p><p><em> Cognitive function? You son of a bitch, brain, respond! Now! </em> Agatha blinked. <em> Faster! </em> She blinked again. Rio was inspecting her face; she was visually calm, but Agatha could feel how she was becoming more restless with every passing second. Finally, <em> finally </em>Agatha’s hand twitched, and she didn’t waste a second. She couldn’t afford that—she needed to soothe Rio’s growing worry.</p><p>She grabbed her hand gently, before the moment slipped through her fingers. “You didn’t overstep.” Her tone was tender. “I just…” <em> Ugh, feelings </em>. Feelings were hard, yet Agatha realized suddenly that Rio’s close proximity was somehow making it easier—lighter. The kind of vulnerability that didn’t feel dangerous. Three-months-ago-Agatha would never have entertained the idea of considering feelings, but now, she was attempting to communicate through them. She felt Rio’s thumb begin tracing small circles on the back of her hand. The corners of her lips twitched. That was so Rio—still trying to ensure Agatha was okay, even though she was the one who just needed soothing. Always giving. Agatha exhaled, “I’m not used to being treated this way. I have no idea how to navigate it.”</p><p>“Just be you,” Rio murmured, her previous worry vanished as if it had never existed in the first place, and her eyes were sparkling with that genuine awe again. “I don’t expect anything from you—I’m just me, and I would like it if you were just you,” she said with a gentle smile, her thumb never stopped its ministrations. </p><p>“I’m trying,” Agatha whispered. She really was. For the first time in probably ever, she was really trying to be emotionally available for someone else. She wondered if Rio could see how difficult it was for her to overcome the wall she had constructed.</p><p>“So far, you’ve been doing really well.” So, perhaps she could see that after all.</p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. “Where have you been my entire life?”</p><p>“I am here now,” Rio’s tone was quiet, yet sounded like a promise.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>“Have you eaten?” Rio asked her as they made it to the kitchen. Her voice wasn’t sharp or suspicious—it was soft, almost shy, but there was intent behind it. Agatha didn’t answer. Not because she didn’t want to. She just… Rio frowned slightly. “I wasn’t here last night,” she was analyzing aloud as she set her bag down, “so there was no shake for you this morning.” Agatha didn’t flinch, but something in her chest fluttered. The shake. She’d missed it. Missed the way it was a subtle thread connecting them. When their eyes met, the look Rio gave her was not judgmental or disappointed; it was a little worried, but otherwise fond. Her brown eyes searched Agatha’s face like she was trying to read a book written in a language she was only just learning. “Agatha?” she asked again, tentatively.</p><p>Agatha sighed, “In my defense, it’s still early.”</p><p>Instead of arguing or commenting, Rio simply reached out and took her hand, tugging her toward the table with that gentle confidence of someone who was sure they’d be followed. Her fingers were warm, and Agatha absolutely loved the way they were slightly calloused. They felt real. “Let’s have a quick bite first, and then we can start making our special-day-treats,” she said brightly, and a bit too excited as if something as simple as sharing a meal with Agatha was worth thriving over.</p><p>Rio began unpacking groceries from her impossibly sensible cloth bag. Of course, she had a cloth bag. Of course, she packed it thoughtfully, like someone who loved both the earth and whoever she was feeding. Agatha leaned against the table, eyes following Rio’s movements like a tether. She didn’t mean to stare, but watching Rio in her element was annoyingly soothing. Then she spotted it. A familiar little brick of packaged noodles peeking from the bag.</p><p>She squinted at it suspiciously. “Ramen?” Her voice was incredulous, tinged with amusement.</p><p>“Udon-type noodles that we’ll use as a base for otherwise nutritious soup,” Rio corrected without looking up from her task of unbagging, her tone was completely unbothered.</p><p>“So… ramen?” Agatha insisted.</p><p>Finally, Rio looked up at her. “Udon.”</p><p>“Udon <em> is </em> ramen,” Agatha countered, her voice rising, teasing. “The Rio Vidal—CEO of health and nutrition—is feeding me ramen?” She let the fake offense flourish on her face. “ <em> Scandalous </em>,” she intoned. ”I’m composing Lilia an email right this second,” she made a threat while pulling her phone from her pocket, not bothering to hide the smirk twitching at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes affectionately. “Agatha,” she said, low and amused. “Shut up.” Agatha gulped. She hasn’t seen this side of Rio—teasing but firm—ever since she’s been sick. Back when she was feverish and barely coherent, and still, somehow, Rio had managed to cut through the fog with just that same voice. She remembered thinking it was hot at the time. Now? Still hot.</p><p>The ramen was a crime against her expectations. It was delicious. Outrageously so. Because apparently, anything Rio Vidal’s hands touched was delightful. It looked nothing like the ramen Agatha was familiar with. It had a full serving of beef—Bulgogi, Rio had explained, Korean barbecued beef, tender and caramelized, sweet and savory all at once. She brought it with her, meaning it was pre-cooked in advance, meaning Rio had planned to have lunch with Agatha. There was a soft-boiled egg, sliced perfectly, the yolk just shy of runny, topped with sweet chili sauce that made Agatha’s lips tingle. Bright green beans, crisp edamame, and chopped baby corn. A scattering of scallions, more of Rio’s special sauce, and a lot of spices.</p><p>Agatha was chewing slowly, enjoying the flavor and texture of this culinary abomination—ramen was not supposed to taste this good, <em> goddammit </em>. It wasn’t supposed to make her feel this warm, this… held.</p><p>“You are quiet,” Rio looked up from her own bowl, eyes glinting with amusement. “Ramen’s that bad, huh?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a fierce look that didn’t really have any heat behind it. “Shut up.” Rio just laughed, bright and reckless.</p><p>The truth was that Agatha got quiet for several reasons, yes, one of those was her enjoying the meal and chewing it thoroughly, but there was more. In her mind, she was trying on different scenarios for their inevitable conversation. How do you even start a conversation like that?<em> Hi, yes, I think I might be falling in love with you, and I need you to tell me everything about your intentions in case I need to not fall in love with you anymore. </em> Yeah… she wasn’t good at this. Agatha didn’t do vulnerability. She did presentations. Reports. Contingency plans. She didn’t ask for what she wanted. She felt things deeply, but never out loud. <em> Oh, lord, have mercy on her worn soul </em>. Agatha could compose a press release that made headlines in under an hour. She could neutralize a PR scandal with two sentences and a smile. She could command silence in a room with a single arch of her brow. But here, with Rio quietly slurping soup across the table, she was reduced to a silent ache and half-formed words. She didn’t know how to be this version of herself. But Rio made her want to try.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Rio was rummaging through her cabinets, pulling out things that Agatha had no idea she owned. Like that shiny, chrome mixer, for example. Whose mixer was that? She had never used it in her entire life. “For someone who doesn’t cook, you’ve got a pretty impressive kitchen,” Rio remarked. “My first night, I had a trunk full of appliances and tools—figured a busy business person probably didn’t own much, but then I opened a couple of drawers, a few cabinets, and I swear, I thought I’d died and gone to heaven,” she said lightly.</p><p><em> Heaven </em>. That word had never belonged in her home before. Nothing about this space had ever felt divine. But with Rio in it, with her light touch and casual grace and maddening softness—it was like everything was being translated into a new language. One Agatha didn’t yet speak, but could somehow understand. That was something new for her, but then again, most things were new when it came to Rio. Somehow, she managed to keep introducing Agatha to something novel every day, be that a spice she’s never tried, or another way to pick food from the plate. It didn’t confine itself just to the kitchen, however. Rio had shown her how to style her hair so the hairspray wouldn’t tangle it too much; she shared a secret of keeping the footwear clean longer; and encouraged her to switch to certain products that, surprisingly, she ended up liking more than what she’d used before. Different minor everyday things—irrelevant on their own, completely insignificant—but in the grand scheme of things, they fostered an experience of engaging with the world with a fresh perspective. And Agatha found herself thinking one day that she actually didn’t hate that world as much anymore.</p><p>“Would you believe me if I told you that I don’t even know what's in this kitchen?” Agatha asked lightly, her voice soft but clear. She needed to tread carefully for many different reasons. First, she was terrified. Terrified of a lot of things—Rio's lack of seriousness about this; outcomes not aligning with expectations; unavoidable life disagreements; potential fallout; and Rio ultimately not wanting her as she is. Second, she simply lacked the emotional capability to engage in those types of conversations. Agatha didn’t do feelings—she felt things, analyzed them quietly in her mind, drew necessary conclusions, and locked them away without ever letting them see the light of day. So, it was only natural that she didn’t know how to talk about feelings with another person. However, Rio had been persuading her to try something new each day, and up to now, the experience had not been unpleasant. Did it feel frightening to alter something you’ve done a specific way your entire life? Definitely. Did taking that leap and shifting your perspective by trying something different prove worthwhile? Also, yes. So, she was going to try because if she didn’t, she would ask herself <em> What if? </em>until the rest of her days.</p><p>“I would believe you, actually, yes,” Rio responded with ease; her tone held no judgment or further inquiries. It almost felt like Rio was aware that Agatha was leading somewhere with that opening line, and she simply waited for her to continue at her own pace. Perhaps it wasn’t just a feeling, and maybe Rio was, in fact, doing precisely that. </p><p>“When I bought this penthouse, obtaining necessities wasn’t exactly my sole focus,” Agatha probed, volunteering a little more information. She looked at Rio’s reactions carefully, and when she didn’t find anything alarming, she continued. “Everyone grieves differently. For me, that year felt like my own death. I lost my child. I finally admitted that I was a lesbian. Got divorced. Moved to New York. I didn’t want to live. But I didn’t want to die anymore. So when I finally managed to escape that limbo of sorrow, I buried myself in building something instead. Threw myself into work until I couldn’t feel anything but the constant exhaustion.” Her tone was even, and she looked composed, but that was on the surface. Inside, Agtha was falling apart, shaking with fear of… she didn’t even know what she was afraid of.</p><p>Rio was listening, fully focused on Agatha. Her facial expressions and body language didn’t reveal any of her reactions. She was just still. The only indication that she was an alive being was that she was blinking and her chest was rising and falling slowly with measured breaths. And then, gently—like a thread slipping through a needle—she spoke. “Every single thing in life happens for a reason,” she said, voice low. “We may think of some things as curses, or punishment, or gods’ wrath, or simply bad luck, but behind even the worst experiences lies our true path that we are destined to discover and walk.” Agatha blinked. That was… nothing that she had anticipated. Not in the slightest. Rio, once again, succeeded in leaving her at a complete loss for words. “And that path,” Rio continued, “will take us exactly where we are supposed to be.” She smiled then, tender and light, and in the soft gleam of the kitchen light, she looked almost unreal. “Look where it has taken you.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “On top of the snob-train?” she cackled. “Surrounded by fancy bastards, I ensure to stay fancy and desirable for as long as their money can keep me?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “No, to this kitchen—making your son’s favorite treat.” She paused for a second and switched to a more gentle tone, “You lost Nicky, gained something new in the form of this home, lost yourself in the fog of agonizing destruction, and found a new purpose in life in the form of building your own empire. Now, you're standing here, using these old, forgotten tools to create something Nicky loved. Don’t you see?” Rio asked, her eyes bright and gaze intense. “You’ve come full circle.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>Agatha needed a minute; her throat tightened. Because that was… Somehow, that five-minute exchange soothed something in her that years of therapy hadn’t even touched. She exhaled slowly and shakily. “I used to cook, you know,” she said quietly. Not justification or a defence, but a fact—a memory. “When Nicky was alive.”</p><p>“I figured.” When Agatha looked at her questioningly, Rio clarified, “I stopped speaking Spanish when dad died.” Rio shrugged as if to make it look less significant, “Lost sense for me without him around.” She smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>“Shame,” Agatha said smoothly, her voice dipping into a flirt because, obviously, Rio wasn’t one of those people who would take offense at not receiving condolences. On the contrary, she did not want any just like Agatha. The universe had a peculiar sense of humor, first teasing Agatha with someone who mirrored her so closely, but then making it increasingly clear with every passing day that it was entirely possible for Agatha to have that person in her life. “I rather like how Spanish sounds,” she smirked, challenging.</p><p>“Is that so?” Rio raised an eyebrow. And Agatha just hummed affirmatively, making Rio’s eyes sparkle again.</p><p>“I guess, you’ll have to get creative and come up with something to find that out,” she cut, her tone while teasing was strong and demanding.</p><p>Aside from those wild eyes, Rio looked totally calm; she was busying herself with laying out the ingredients on the prep table, not reacting to Agatha's tease in any way. The doubt that she might have misinterpreted flirty energy hadn’t even crossed Agatha's mind. She hadn’t misread anything. Rio was devising a plan in her mind—Agatha recognized that look. It was genuinely exciting that, even though they hadn't known each other long, Agatha could already interpret many of Rio’s behavior patterns. The bond was there without a doubt.</p><p>Rio put on her<em> real-men </em> apron and pulled out the Dipplin hat when her eyes lit up. “I almost forgot,” she gasped, darting toward the couch where she’d left her backpack. “I got you something.” She rummaged for a second before jogging back with a little bundle cradled carefully in her hands. “You’re my sous-chef today,” she said with a toothy grin, “so you’ll need this.” She unfolded the bundle, and Agatha blinked. It was a chef’s hat. Light purple, trimmed with turquoise, pink, and white, patterned all over with tiny teacups and pots. Each one had a little purple ghost peeking out from inside. It was a Pokémon. One Agatha didn’t recognize. She didn’t let that fact distract her from the issue at hand.</p><p>“Rio,” she said flatly, narrowing her eyes. “While this pot—”</p><p>“Polteageist,” she interrupted, pointing her index finger.</p><p>“—while this Polteageist is absolutely adorable,” Agatha continued without missing a beat, ”there’s no way I’m wearing a hat.” Agatha spent way too much time on styling her hair every day; in fact, her hair was one of the rare things that made her feel sexy these days. She knew it was impressive, knew that it could get people’s attention. Her hair was her weapon; she loved how it was making her feel. There was no way in hell she was messing up her hairdo with a hat.</p><p>“Agatha,” she exhaled slowly. And was Rio’s tone serious now? <em>Oh?</em> <em>Wait</em>, she should probably pay attention to what Rio was saying. “You are cooking with me today, and you are wearing the hat. These are the rules.” Bossy. <em>Okay. Fuck</em>. Still no on the hat.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, “What else, a <em> good-girl </em> apron to match this?” she gestured to the script on Rio’s apron.</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrow. Sharp and amused, yet not impressed. “You getting splashes all over your clothes is totally your personal business. You don’t want an apron—you don’t wear one. But your hair, while absolutely <em> gorgeous </em> ,” she emphasized, her gaze lingering as if she could caress Agatha’s hair with just her eyes, “is not getting in our food. Not in <em> my </em> kitchen.” Her kitchen. <em> Her </em> kitchen. <em> Fuck me. Okay, fine </em> . Apparently, that’s all that it takes to break Agatha Harkness. She outstretched her arm, palm up, and ready to surrender, expecting Rio to hand her the hat. But, as always, Rio did absolutely nothing that Agatha was expecting. She approached her slowly and looked into her eyes, deep and steady. Agatha’s breath hitched, and she had to fight a moan when Rio’s hand made contact. She ran her fingers through her hair, gathering it gently in a ponytail, and twisting a little as if to form a bun. Her touch was soft, precise, respectful, but hot enough to set every nerve in Agatha’s body on fire. She could feel the warmth of her skin on her scalp and was trying to keep her eyes open, maintaining eye contact that Rio, as always, never broke. With her other hand, she unfolded the hat and tenderly put it over Agatha’s head, careful not to mess her hair too much. And, <em> okay, yeah </em> , Agatha could live with that. The hand that was just in her hair descended slightly and was now resting at the back of her neck. Skin-to-skin contact was burning like a wildfire. Agatha was watching in real time how Rio’s pupils dilated, and her breathing became a little shallow. Her fingertips were just resting there, not moving, grounding. She swallowed hard, and Rio’s eyes dropped to her lips. <em> Fuck </em> . This was very bad. Very, very bad. They needed to talk first. Before they did something reckless <em> , </em> they <em> needed </em>to talk.</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to say something—anything, but Rio beat her to it. “We will start with meringues,” her voice was so low that Agatha wouldn’t have heard her, had they not been that close. <em> They were so close. </em> But then Rio took a clearly unwilling step back. “Because it takes about two hours for them to set and dry, so…” She exhaled and moved toward the prep table, turning and reaching for Agatha’s hand. “Come on,” her voice was getting back to normal slowly. “You’re on the whip duty,” she said with a smirk. <em> FUCK ME.  </em></p><p>Unfortunately, this whip duty meant whipping egg whites with the mixer. Unfortunately, Agatha’s mind was too wrapped up in thoughts of another kind of whipping—one that made her fingers twitch and her thoughts scatter. And unfortunately, she was certain it was written all over her face, judging by the smug little curve of Rio’s lips. Unless she was just that proud that Agatha separated egg whites from yolks like she’d done that before. She had done that before, but she was sure neither of them cared about cooking anymore. The air was charged. Agatha could still feel the ghost of Rio’s fingers on her skin as she moved through the motions on autopilot. Her body seemed to be following some distant rhythm—egg whites in the bowl, mixer in hand—and Rio was casually sliding the Stevia extract onto the prep table beside her. Because, obviously, they were making treats with no processed sugar.</p><p>“Okay, so now—” Rio’s voice came from behind her, low and soft and close. So close, Agatha felt it in her spine before her ears caught the words. Too close. Then came the warmth of another body behind her, almost but not quite pressed into her back. Rio’s hands appeared from either side, framing her torso. One reached for the stevia packet on the counter, the other planted itself gently on the table’s surface, her forearm grazing Agatha’s waist. “—you start whipping,” she murmured, “and I’ll be slowly adding the sweetener.” Her voice was getting closer with every word, and finally, at <em> the sweetener,</em> Agatha felt hot breath on her ear. She gulped, as Rio drew closer. She barely had time to react before Rio stepped forward completely, closing the last inch of space between them, her front meeting Agatha’s back. The contact was light, careful, and subtle, not suffocating, rough, or possessive. Yet, it burned like thousands of flames. ​​She couldn’t focus on the egg whites. Couldn’t focus on anything. All she could focus on was Rio.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha half-whispered, half-whined, the sound catching in her throat. “I… I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>“It’s easy, look,” her breath was hot on her skin. “It’s all in your wrist.”</p><p>“I’m not talking about whipping,” Agatha said breathlessly. She expected to tense up, but instead, her body, as if having a mind of its own, leaned into Rio slightly. She heard a sharp inhale behind her. The stevia packet was abandoned on the counter with a soft rustle. Now both of Rio’s hands were braced on the prep table, trapping Agatha between its surface and her body.</p><p>Agatha began feeling a little lightheaded, like her body had tilted off its axis. “Do you have any idea what you are doing to me?” she tilted her head just enough to murmur against the skin of Rio’s cheek. She felt, rather than heard, the way Rio’s breath stuttered. Her own breath was not even either, and her pulse was loud in her ears.</p><p>“If what you’re doing to me is any indication,” Rio said in a voice so low it trembled through her, “then yes, I have a pretty good idea.” She shifted her head, and suddenly their lips were a breath apart. Agatha could feel warm puffs of air on her mouth. She smelled like ramen, and surprisingly, absurdly, she didn’t hate it. “Agatha,” Rio whispered. Agatha felt her hand slide slowly, reverently around her waist. Fingers splaying across her abdomen, anchoring her. The touch was branding, and sent sparks darting through her bloodstream.</p><p><em> Now was the time to talk! </em> Agatha was screaming internally. And then she felt the faintest brush of lips against hers—a ghost of the touch, a whisper, as if Rio were testing the waters, waiting for Agatha to give her any sign—to pull away or pull her in. And although it physically pained Agatha, she had to pull away slightly. She pressed gently against Rio’s arm, just enough to break contact, her fingers curled around her wrist as if to say <em> I’m not leaving. </em>She knew she didn’t need to apply any force, with how attentive and attuned to her Rio had been—Agatha knew she would understand right away. Still, she felt compelled to clarify. “Wait,” she whispered, feeling Rio's grip on her body loosen, but it didn’t feel like a rejection. Just a quiet, steady patience.</p><p>Agatha turned slowly to face her, the prep table cool against her rear. She rested her palms on Rio’s chest, fingers twitching nervously at the straps of her apron. Her pulse thundered so loudly, a wild, frenetic beat against her ribcage, she was sure Rio could hear it. Rio’s hand, which had previously been pressed to her stomach, shifted to her side as Agatha turned, but she kept it there, holding her steady yet gently. Her eyes were darker than usual, searching her face with an intensity that made Agatha’s skin prickle. The smile Rio always wore, that playful spark, was gone—replaced by something different. Something raw, something deep. Agatha couldn’t look away. She had to close her eyes just for a moment to gather her thoughts. Her body moved on its own, as though some invisible tether was pulling her toward Rio. When her eyes opened again, she found herself pressing their foreheads together—even her subconscious reaching for Rio. It was everything Agatha had been running from. Everything she didn’t <em> want </em> to want. But here, in this moment, she couldn’t lie anymore. She couldn’t hide from what she felt. She reminded herself—she could tell Rio absolutely anything. Whatever different lines she had prepped in her mind vanished—the pragmatic side of her retreating, leaving only instincts, bare and vulnerable. She moved one hand up, fingers brushing along Rio’s throat, then cupping her cheek. Her thumb lingered just beneath her eye. She felt her breathing deepen, but she was keeping still otherwise. “Tell me—” Agatha’s voice cracked, barely there. She swallowed hard, tried again. “Tell me this isn’t just a passing crush for you,” she whispered, her tone desperate, almost begging. Rio’s fingers curled gently around her wrist—not to hold her, but to steady her. To ground them both.</p><p>“This is not a crush for me, Agatha,” she replied without skipping a beat, and Agatha had never heard her tone so serious before.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved. She couldn’t breathe around the ache in her throat. She needed her head clear to have this conversation. She needed to focus, <em>goddammit</em>. “I need to detach myself from you,” she murmured, her words barely there, as she gently pushed Rio back—just enough to create space, but not too much. Not too much, because everything in her screamed to close that distance again. “I need us to talk, but I cannot concentrate with you being so close.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, and her eyes held Rio’s gaze. "Give me room?”</p><p>Rio, without any remarks, complaints, or wounded silence, made a step back, her hand falling at her side. Agatha didn’t know if that was better because now all she wanted to do was keep touching Rio. Her body missed the heat of her skin already.</p><p>“Do I need to worry?” she asked Agatha softly.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help a smile tugging at her lips. When they first began this strange, tentative thing between them, she’d assumed Rio was just... emotionally stable. That’s why she didn’t recoil from Agatha’s sharp edges, why she didn’t flinch at the baggage that trailed behind her like smoke. Agatha thought—naïvely—that Rio had made peace with all of it, that she had the rare serenity of someone who could accept a partner fractured in all the wrong places. She soon found out that it wasn’t the case at all. Rio wasn’t serene—she was detached. Emotionally disconnected in a way that made her strange and brilliant, frustrating and extraordinary. She didn’t process things the way most people did. Her understanding of emotion was architectural, a structure built from analysis rather than feeling. She could trace pain and joy and fear like they were star maps, but she didn’t walk them like paths. And so, when she looked at Agatha, she genuinely didn’t see anything broken. That also explained how she never gave her any of that scripted bullshit Agatha had grown used to dodging.</p><p>It was as if each of them had empty slots within their essence—damaged energy fields marked by the dents—and the universe had scavenged its galaxies to discover the right quarks to fill those voids. From those quarks, it formed Rio’s soul that perfectly complemented Agatha’s, and Agatha’s soul that flawlessly matched Rio’s. It was quite a bizarre notion, but it was the only way to explain how the things that were making Agatha broken filled the missing pieces in Rio, and how Rio’s oddness was precisely what Agatha needed. Agatha couldn’t fathom how she had gotten so lucky to find such a person, and she certainly wasn’t about to question it now. She simply wanted to grasp it and flee, running until the cosmos caught on and recognized she shouldn’t have gotten this.</p><p>“Do you feel like you need to worry?” Agatha asked in return, not bothering to hide her smile. She’d learned early on that Rio needed encouragement to name her thoughts aloud. She didn’t always realize she had emotions unless Agatha gently, consistently helped her surface them. And she often needed some help to understand what was happening and what Agatha was feeling, too. It wasn’t always easy for Agatha since she had never been exceptionally good at talking about feelings, but they were in this together, and so she tried her best. Because Rio was making her feel safe, and she wanted nothing more than to be that safety in return. She wanted to be Rio’s shelter, her steady orbit.</p><p>“I feel like you’re about to argue,” Rio replied, voice precise. “Because you’ve been overthinking this. I’m not the biggest fan of arguing with you over something that you don’t even think, but that society tells you you <em>should</em> <em>think</em>.” Her tone was analytical, but not cold. And that was exactly what Agatha meant by Rio being attuned to her. That uncanny accuracy, that laser-point understanding of the subtext she never said out loud.</p><p>“Rio, I’m fifty,” Agatha began. Rio blinked but remained still otherwise. Agatha rarely opened up, and when she did, Rio always ensured she had all the time she needed to organize her thoughts and express them. She never interrupted or added remarks; she simply waited for Agatha to say everything. She leaned on the bar stool and listened, breathing evenly. “I’m not playing games,” Agatha continued. “Never been the type. And I’m definitely not interested in starting now.” There was a weight to the words she hadn’t planned on. She just needed it on record.</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, absorbing her like a data stream. “I’m not playing any games either. Especially not with you, Agatha,” she said, calmly as always.</p><p>And she believed her—trusting Rio wasn’t a problem; it had never been. What concerned Agatha was her uncertainty about whether Rio’s mind had been completely made up. “But you’re so young—you’ve got the whole life ahead of you—to figure out what you want to do, and how and with whom you want to do it.” Rio’s frown deepened, eyes never leaving Agatha’s face—examining her reactions, the timbre of her tone, the shifting of her gaze. Agatha wasn't going to pretend that it didn’t scare her—the probability of their dynamics being an illusion, something she had created in her mind based on her fantasies rather than real interactions. It scared Agatha that this illusion could probably come to an end today, but at the same time, she knew if it was going to, it was better this way—better end it now, until it got too far and hurt even more.</p><p>“Agatha,” as always, Rio’s voice pulled her out of the fog. “How old do you think I am?” Her tone was unusually light. Curious. Almost amused.</p><p>“I…” <em> Wait </em>, why was Rio looking at her like that? Agatha had never seen such an amused gaze on her before, and yet she could see the first tugs of a smile already begin appearing on Rio’s face, and the bright spark in her eyes was returning. It was Agatha’s turn to frown now.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said again, stepping forward, pushing off the stool. “I’m forty-three. Thi—“</p><p>“What?!” she didn’t mean to interrupt or yell, but… <em> WHAT?! </em> Rio chuckled and made another step toward Agatha, but she put her hand between them, stopping her. “I think I need to see some ID.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, “You are joking.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha deadpanned. How the fuck did this happen? How could she be so blind? </p><p>Rio pulled her wallet and dropped the plastic next to Agatha on the counter. She picked it up and looked at it, then looked at Rio. Looked at it again.</p><p>“Anything else?” Rio pretended to sound offended, although Agatha could hear the notes of affection in her tone. “My medical history? Dental chart?”</p><p>“How do you look like that?!” Agatha was still staring at the numerals on the card—<em> 1982 </em>.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, took the card from Agatha’s hand, and shoved it back into her wallet. “I use a very good foundation.”</p><p>Agatha was just standing there, completely still, blinking. Rio chuckled and leaned next to her on the counter, bumping her shoulder playfully, “I’m serious—layers of it.”</p><p>“This can’t be true,” Agatha argued. She squinted her eyes and dramatically moved her face closer to Rio’s as if to take a look directly through her skin. Rio just shook her head in that soft, indulgent way she always did when Agatha was being ridiculous. She turned suddenly and, without a word, left the kitchen, heading to the bathroom. Agatha was confused. She waited because what else was she supposed to do?</p><p>Rio emerged soon enough, her face freshly washed and bare of any makeup. She came close to Agatha, so close their bodies were nearly touching again. And this close, Agatha could see that Rio, in fact, was in her forties. She saw ​​the truth in the fine lines, the lived-in beauty. Before she could even recognize the impulse, her fingers moved to touch her face, to trace those lines with her fingertips. She wanted so badly to follow their path with her lips. “Don’t believe anything you see in public or online. We all are just trying to sell ourselves,” Rio said simply. “I do nutrition for a living—my appearance is my business card.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were still on her face when Rio reached up and took them. She held them carefully, like something rare. Something precious. “You okay?” she asked quietly. That was a million-dollar question. ​​Agatha had been bracing for this to fail from the beginning. She had rehearsed all the reasons—<em> it’s too complicated, she’s too young, I’m too much. </em> But now, one of the pillars had crumbled, and in its place stood possibility, and she was not prepared for that. </p><p>“I don’t know,” she said honestly.</p><p>“You don’t know?” Rio repeated, chuckling under her breath.</p><p>Agatha sighed. She would’ve run her hand through her hair, but Rio was holding them, and that was far too pleasant to stop. “I’ve been overthinking this for far too long, yet didn’t think this particular case scenario through—the positive outcome. And now I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>She felt Rio’s thumbs begin making soothing circles on her skin, and the contrast of the soft touch and callused palms was making Agatha shiver. “Tell me what is bothering you?” Rio whispered, voice thick with gentleness, as if she could wrap herself around Agatha’s fears and hold them too, making her forget what she was so afraid of to begin with. That was Rio, and she could talk about anything to Rio because Rio would always understand her. Because if Rio wanted to leave, she would have done that a long time ago.</p><p>“I thought you were at least ten years younger, and in my mind, the likelihood of you noticing me was zero,” she began, her tone shy, yet pushing through. It didn’t matter how embarrassing discussing such things seemed; she knew Rio would never think less of her. It was still not easy, but Rio’s touch—warm, grounding—and her proximity, the gentle tilt of her head, the quiet intensity of her gaze, definitely helped.</p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t change. “Well, now you know I’m not as young as you thought. I still don’t understand what the issue with me being younger is, though,” she admitted honestly, her voice soft but steady.</p><p>Agatha looked at her questioningly. Of course, such things were not on Rio’s radar. Something like that was irrelevant for Rio, who religiously believed that everything was code. “Not an issue, per se… I just assumed that it’s likely you would rather focus on pursuing your dreams, career, and fulfilling your aspirations.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly and gave Agatha a fond look. “And why can I not do all that while holding your hand in mine?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart fluttered in her chest. She genuinely couldn’t understand how Rio made everything feel so simple. Now, she was viewing her concerns from a slightly different perspective, considering the new objective, and perhaps Rio had a point. Maybe it didn’t have to be complicated at all. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I thought I would slow you down, hold you back—I’m not easy, and you still have so much to achieve.” Although the new objective—that Rio is much older—alleviated one of Agatha’s worries, she was still young enough to pursue opportunities in life, leaving Agatha uncertain about her place in that scenario.</p><p>Something shifted in Rio’s eyes, a spark ran through her gaze, as if she suddenly realized something. “I’m pretty much set for life,” she said simply. Agatha narrowed her eyes, waiting for her to continue. “Somehow this has never come up,” Rio chuckled lightly. “I have already achieved everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m a registered dietitian with a doctorate in psychology, and an additional master's degree in nutrition science.” <em> A what in psychology?! Rio Vidal was a fucking doctor?! </em>“This is my company, Agatha. I actually retired from cooking for people when I turned forty. I wanted to focus on the scientific side of nutrition and its link to the human psyche, and I have been working on my book for the past two years.” Agatha’s brain was short-circuiting, trying to process what she just heard. “I don’t need anything else on this path, except for someone to walk it with,” Rio paused for a split second. “And until recently, I had no doubt that such a person didn’t exist.” After a few moments with Agatha still not saying anything, Rio started to grow a little worried—the spark in her eyes dimmed a little, and she was desperately trying to read Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I was sure it’s Lilia’s company.” That was most likely not what Rio needed to hear, but Agatha had to fill the silence with something while she was rebooting her brain and forming coherent sentences on the matter. </p><p>“Lilia is my CFO, and she’s better with people than I could ever be,” Rio chuckled. Yet, it wasn’t lost on Agatha that it was not the usual cheerful sound. “This isn’t a secret to me that I differ from the norms in terms of human experiences and interactions,” she said quietly, shy. Agatha instinctively tightened her grip on Rio’s hands, thumb brushing gently over knuckles, silently offering reassurance. She hated how Rio thought that this incredible thing about her—the thing that made her <em> her </em>—was something to be ashamed of. “I realized that pretty young, actually, and started studying psychology to better understand how and why I am different. The more I’ve learned, the better I've been able to mimic, eventually excelling in masking. Or at least I think I’m excelling. Most of the time, people cannot tell I’m not like them unless I'm distracted and slip.” Agatha frowned. That was so fucked up—the way Rio thought it was something bad and needed concealing, forcing her brain to stay alert twenty-four-seven in order to maintain the facade. Though that was pretty much what she’d been doing for most of her life. “So, I’ve been doing alright on my own when I first started cooking for others until I scored that huge, celebrity account, and it blew up after that—I blew up. They recommended me to another famous person, and they recommended me to another one, and it just went from there. I started catering personal events, business functions, fundraisers, and such, hiring a team to help out. And it became apparent that I needed to expand. I wouldn’t have been able to handle management even if I had been socially adept, as I was busy cooking all day long. Lilia was the perfect fit.” Agatha was so absorbed in the narration that she didn’t notice that they had relocated and were now sitting on the couch. One of Rio’s hands was still holding hers, thumb stroking absentmindedly, and she was gesturing with the other one to support her story.</p><p>“She has been my dad’s financial consultant for years and became a family friend. I trusted her to run the company, making it thrive and prosper. Eventually, we got a full-staffed team of professionals, and today it’s a well-organized machine that can cover pretty much any event, along with dozens of personal accounts. And today, I can step out and do what I’ve always liked doing—science.” Rio’s eyes sparked with joy at that. Agatha liked the way she literally lit up anytime she was speaking of something she was passionate about. However, that spark wasn’t a long-lasting one as Rio continued, “So, see? Not only did I achieve a thing or two, but I should be considered worthy to fit your status.” Her tone faltered at the end. It wasn’t bitterness, not quite, but something adjacent. Something tight and vulnerable hiding behind her words. It hung there, delicate and unresolved, until Agatha felt the tension bloom between them like static in the air. So, <em> wait </em> . Had that been bothering Rio all along? Did she truly think Agatha saw her as <em> just </em> a chef? A hired hand with no place in her world beyond the kitchen?</p><p><em> God </em>, Agatha was so stupid. She felt the realization hit her square in the chest. Of course, Rio would think that. Of course, she’d internalized it, especially with Agatha keeping her distance for so long. And just now, that dumb, careless comment about Rio having “her whole life” to accomplish things. How small that must have made her feel. “I didn’t realize I was making you think that,” she said honestly. Her tone was steady and straightforward. Sincere. “So, I need to be clear—this has never crossed my mind. I’ve never cared about your status. I just thought… I didn’t dare to think you would be interested, that you were serious about this… About me,” she finally confessed, and searched Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio gave a soft laugh, half-amused, half-exasperated. “Agatha. I’ve been bending over backwards trying to stay consistent in those little extras for you for over three months.” And Agatha could tell that everything Rio had done for her was something she enjoyed. It was not an obligation, a task, or a chore. That was something she chose and put her heart into. “I’ve been basically writing you love letters for as long.” She scooched closer to her so that their thighs were touching. “I played piano for you—something that I haven’t done ever since dad died, simply because I didn’t see the point anymore.” She reached for a strand of Agatha’s hair, wrapping it around her finger in slow, deliberate circles. Like she was learning its weight, its texture, its meaning. Agatha stilled, her breath catching. “I stayed with you when you were sick,” Rio murmured, voice quieter now. “This is not the kind of service I provide.” Right. The service. Rio was still technically under her employ. Agatha opened her mouth to speak, but the words caught. She needed to address the blurred lines between them, the employment situation, the boundaries and ethics, but Rio kept going, gently dismantling every wall between them with the ease of someone who had already stepped through the door. “You always emphasize your age like it’s a flaw.” <em> And it wasn’t? </em> Agatha wanted to ask, but didn’t dare interrupt because that was another thing about Rio that totally captivated her—how her mind worked, how she saw the world.</p><p>“Yes, you look your age, but so do I.” Rio’s voice was low now, intimate. “I like it that we are not young, but have baggage of experiences.” Rio let go of her hair and traced her fingers under Agatha’s eye, “I like your wrinkles—they show you lived. I like your tired eyes, they show how hard you work.” Her fingertips caressed her skin, cupping her cheek for a moment. Agatha immediately leaned into the touch. “At first, I thought it was only about the company, but now, knowing all I know about you… You’re a fighter, Agatha.” Her hand kept moving slowly, now wrapping around her neck. “I admire your strength and courage. Your determination.” She buried her fingers in Agatha’s hair then and lightly scratched her scalp. Agatha wouldn’t be able to hold it even if she wanted to—she moaned softly, her eyes falling shut. “This is the face of someone who is not afraid to always move forward, who is not shy to always be thirsty for more,” Rio carried on, her tone like a lullaby—steady yet gentle, serious yet warm.</p><p>“And this is the body of someone who always rises.” Agatha felt their foreheads press together. One of her hands was still held by Rio’s, so she moved her other one. She palmed her jean-covered thigh and heard Rio’s breath catch. Although she didn’t stop talking, she was whispering now, “This is the body of someone who, despite being tired and beaten by life—it’s challenges, lessons, and trials—gets up every single time, and pushes forward. I admire your body and hope you will allow me the privilege of reading the memoirs that recount your journey inscribed on your skin.” Her breath was hot on Agatha’s face, and combined with those words, it was making her lightheaded, her pulse thumped with need—the need for Rio. To touch her. To kiss her. To hold her. Anything. She needed her in every way possible. “I don’t want someone younger, with a toned, perfect body—which I will tell you a secret, does not exist as a concept, but this is a discussion for another time—immaculate skin, and no drama. I want a real person who lived and lives. A person who messes up, makes mistakes, and learns. I want a person who knows they are not perfect and are always hungry for more, trying to become the most perfect version of themselves.” She pulled back just enough to meet her gaze and stilled. Agatha opened her eyes to find Rio looking back at her intently. Her eyes were blown wide, dark and burning with yearning. “And I want to walk this path alongside that person. Alongside you.” </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Her heart was drumming crazy rounds in her chest, and her breathing was shallow. Her hand crept higher up Rio’s thigh, slow and sure, making her inhale sharply. Agatha licked her lips, and Rio’s eyes dropped down. “I need you to resign effective immediately,” Agatha whispered, yet it was urgent, commanding, it sounded like an order.</p><p>Rio’s eyes shot up and burned into hers. “I already have,” she murmured back, leaning in impossibly close, and dragging her nose along Agatha’s. “Yesterday. I returned your payment, and your bank should process the transaction within the next three-five bus—“ The words got muffled in her mouth because Agatha was kissing her. She fisted Rio’s shirt, jerking her body into hers possessively, crashing their mouths together like it was the only thing keeping her alive. Like she'd been starving for years, and this was her first real breath. Which, in a way, was.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>The heat of the moment had softened into something quieter—but no less consuming. They were trading slower kisses now—memorizing the curves of each other’s mouths, chasing the breaths that stuttered between them. Agatha felt like she was decoding a language she’d only ever glimpsed in myth. Rio was soft against her—solid and warm and unbearably present—and she wanted to devour her, every inch, every breath. She tasted like all the things Agatha had permitted herself to imagine in secret, but never dared to reach for.</p><p>With the final swipe of her tongue over Agatha’s bottom lip, Rio pulled back ever so slightly. Agatha was ready to complain, to chase after her again, when she felt it. A soft, deliberate brush across her nose. <em> Rio’s lips were on her nose </em>. Not quite kissing, just softly gliding. Her breath hitched. “What… what are you doing?” she whispered, voice breaking on the edges of confusion and wonder. </p><p>Rio didn’t answer at first. She just hummed, her lips tracing the length of Agatha’s nose with delicate, lingering pressure—up and down, then up again—until she finally pressed a kiss to the bridge, then another a little lower, and another, right on the tip. “Fulfilling my long-time fantasy,” she murmured, her lips never stopping their ministrations.</p><p>Agatha gulped, stunned, “You like my nose?!”</p><p>She felt Rio’s smile against her skin. “I love your nose,” she said earnestly, without missing a beat. “I’m your nose’s humble prisoner, and I never want parole.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath of laughter—quiet and incredulous, like it had escaped before she could stop it. She felt ridiculous for laughing, and even more ridiculous for how much it moved her. Her chest ached with it. “You’re deranged,” she murmured, blinking at her, fluttering her lashes over Rio’s cheek.</p><p>Rio didn’t reply—she just kissed her again. Her lips trailed from the bridge of her nose to the corner of her eye, featherlight. She kissed her there, and then her eyelid, and then her temple. Her cheekbone and down her jaw. She was taking her time, laying a trail like a map only she knew how to read. “I love your laugh, too,” she whispered into her skin. “Like it’s a secret you only let out by accident and only I get to hear it.” Agatha's heart clenched. It was true—no one else had ever heard her laugh like this. It wasn’t something she gave away. Only Rio had drawn it out of her, like a soft miracle. And all that was a little too much—Agatha was certain that she had never been wanted like that, and she didn’t know what to do with that, with that tenderness, that affection. She needed something a little more familiar, so she didn’t lose herself in this stream of pure devotion.</p><p>She shifted slightly—instinct taking over, burying her hand in Rio’s hair and sliding the other one over her shoulder. Rio’s lips were skimming her neck when Agatha fisted some hair in the back of her head and pulled. The sound that escaped Rio was straight out of a pornography film. Agatha’s breath hitched. <em> Noted </em>. She adjusted her weight, moved with clean precision, and straddled Rio’s lap in one smooth motion. Rio’s hands immediately slid up her thighs, and Agatha could feel the heat of her palms through her pants. With the hand still in her hair, Agatha pulled Rio’s face close and branded her bottom lip with a possessive swipe of her tongue. Rio’s grip on her thighs tightened, and she parted her lips, giving Agatha full access. The kiss was hot and messy, the kind that left you dizzy with want. Agatha moved her hand from Rio’s shoulder to her neck, resting against her throat but not circling around it, not pre​​ssing, just present there.</p><p>She rocked her hips into Rio, and she gasped, “Agatha.” The name rang in her ears like an echo of a prayer. Agatha wanted to hear it again and again. She hummed but didn’t respond other than rocking into Rio again. Rio chuckled, breathless. “Agatha, slow down,” she whispered, tender and amused. “We’re moving too fast.”</p><p>“I don’t know if you noticed,” Agatha was panting against Rio’s lips, “but we are not twenty anymore. Can we really afford the luxury of a slow-burning romance?”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, pulling her mouth away. “Let me do right by you,” her voice was quiet, a warm hum against Agatha's skin. She pressed a gentle kiss to the corner of her mouth, and then another one to her jaw. “Let me take you out on a date,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s hand dropped from Rio’s throat and gripped the front of her shirt, the fabric soft between her fingers. She wasn’t pulling her closer. She was anchoring herself, trying to stay upright in a moment that threatened to unmake her. “Rio,” her throat felt hoarse despite her soft whisper, “we just had a date last night. And all the other Sundays before that.”</p><p>“One <em> real </em> date,” Rio whispered. "Please?" her mouth quirked into the faintest smile against the edge of Agatha’s jaw, but she didn’t press further—she was listening now, attuned.</p><p>Agatha sighed, pressing their foreheads together. They’ve been technically dating for three months, but <em> fine </em>, if that was what Rio needed. Even though it felt cliché, and Agatha loathed the idea of waiting, that was fine. She could do that for Rio. She had to start learning how to be a responsive, supporting partner, so let this be her first lesson. She pulled back just enough to meet her gaze—those brown eyes burned into her wide and unguarded. “Do you need me to stop?” Agatha asked, and her voice sounded steadier than she felt. She moved to dismantle Rio’s lap, but strong hands tightened the grip on her thighs.</p><p>“No, stay,” Rio whispered urgently. “I like the weight of your body on top of mine.” Agatha inhaled. This woman was going to ruin her. The great Agatha Harkness will face her downfall at the hands of a pretty girl. Poetry had tried to warn her that it was a thing, but she didn’t believe it. “I’m not asking you to stop,” Rio murmured, her thumbs now tracing burning circles into the fabric of Agatha’s pants, and she wished they were not in the way. “Just slow down?” Rio then reached up, her fingers trembling just slightly as she tucked a lock of hair behind Agatha’s ear, letting her touch trail along the curve of her cheek. Her skin was warm, grounding. </p><p>Agatha shook her head, slow and fond, “You’re making it very hard to stay composed.”</p><p>Rio’s features softened, melted, the heat in her expression dimming like twilight into something just as radiant but infinitely gentler. “I have faith in you,” she said softly, as though they were the only people left in the world, and Agatha knew that she wasn’t speaking just about this particular moment.</p><p>“Okay,” she blinked, there were no tears to fall, but her eyes were heavy with the weight of their connection. She welcomed that weight; it felt like a part of Rio was within her, holding her, protecting her. Her heart cracked open with a terrifying kind of freedom—a clean, wide break where light could finally reach. She nodded, just barely, “Okay.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio breathed. This time, when she leaned in, her kiss was the softest they’ve shared yet. She pressed her lips to the curve of Agatha’s neck, just above the collarbone, where her pulse fluttered like wings under her skin. “I want everything,” she murmured against her throat, each word a vow. “The sharp edges and the soft parts. The dignity and the mess. I want your 2 a.m. cuddles before you finally fall asleep, and your 5 a.m. grumbling. I want to know what you’re like when no one’s looking.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her voice came out thin, fragile, vulnerable, “You already do.”</p><p>And that made Rio crumble. Her forehead dropped to Agatha’s collarbone, breath catching like she’d just been winded. Her arms wound around her waist, drawing her in like she could press them into the same heartbeat. “How are you real?” she half-whined, her voice thick, but steady.</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers into Rio’s hair again, tugged—not too harsh, but enough to make Rio look at her, “Don’t cliché me, Dr. Vidal.” Rio’s eyes immediately darkened, pupils blown. She stilled, letting Agatha manhandle her, breathing hard. “Is this what you actually feel like saying?” She asked her sharply, yet there was no threat behind her tone. “Speak your mind,” Agatha grazed her jaw with her teeth lightly. “I want you to always speak your mind,” she nipped her skin then, not enough to hurt, but enough to claim, making Rio moan barely audible—she felt its vibration rather than heard the sound. “Never,” she bit harder now, “I repeat—never mask with me.” Then, without warning, she pulled away, making Rio whine, and letting the cool air sweep in between the heat of their bodies. She gripped Rio’s jaw in her palm and aligned their faces like twin constellations—close, deliberate. “Do you understand?” She could only hope that Rio wouldn’t find her too much. But if she was going to ask Rio to be real, then she had to do the same. And judging by Rio’s reactions, and the way she looked at her—like she was the only storm she’d ever willingly walk into... She had a pretty good feeling about it.</p><p>“That’s precisely what I meant,” Rio swallowed. “My dad was the only person who, despite not always understanding me, didn’t try to analyze me and make me fit. He just let me <em>be</em> without feeling threatened by the way I am.” Her tone was low and steady despite the moment they’d just shared. Agatha loosened her grip on Rio’s hair and cupped her cheek, feeling the woman beneath her lean into the touch. Rio smiled—dreamy and unguarded—and kept speaking, soft and clear, “And right until I met you, I thought that feeling was gone with him. You make me feel so at peace with myself. You are a marvel, Agatha. Someone who is real and raw. Someone who looks at me sees that there is something off, and still wants to be near. I’ve never searched for anyone, knowing there was nobody out there for me, and then…” She shook her head in that affectionate way, “You are someone who isn’t daunted by how I am, but is drawn to it. And I don’t know how the fuck did I hack that code to get <em> this </em>, but I’m never letting you go.” She smirked then, “Just so you know.”</p><p>Agatha froze. Rio Vidal—scholarly, measured, intensely composed Rio Vidal was <em> swearing </em> . Sitting with Agatha in her lap, saying all these unbelievable, devastating things. <em> Swearing </em> . She didn’t know how to move. She didn’t know what to say. All she could do was feel. The slight tremble in Rio’s hands. The ache in her chest from how hard her heart was beating. The unfamiliar miracle of being held—not claimed, not seduced, not examined or saved. Just <em> held</em>. Agatha let both of her hands frame Rio’s face now. Her thumbs traced along the clean edges of her cheekbones, featherlight, back and forth like they were drawing memory into her skin. Her own breath began to even out. She rested her forehead against Rio’s, eyes fluttering shut. And for the first time in longer than she could remember, Agatha didn’t feel like she had to perform strength. She just let herself be wanted without demand, and hoped she could convey that she wanted Rio just as much in return. And Rio just held her tighter, as if she truly had no intention of letting go.</p><p>They stayed like that for a long time—two hearts pressed close, not asking for more, not needing to. Rio didn’t flinch from being seen, and Agatha didn’t shrink from being held. They let themselves be wanted, not for what they could do or who they pretended to be, but simply for who they already were. And for the first time in too many years, the edges inside Agatha began to soften. The sharpness dulled, the pain quieted. She realized with shocking clarity that she could finally start healing now—not alone, not pretending, but with someone who embraced every part of her.</p><p>The world could wait. The past could ache. But here, in the hush between heartbeats, Agatha found something terrifying and beautiful: she had survived long enough to be loved. And she was finally ready to let herself live.</p>

<p>Eventually, they managed to detach and relocate back to the kitchen, though it took them several long moments of stolen kisses and reluctant separation. They cooked slowly, playfully, drifting around each other like dancers mid-rehearsal, brushing hands and sharing teasing glances. Every so often, Agatha would lean in to kiss Rio just because she <em> could </em> now, and each time she did, the world felt a little softer. A little less cruel. It was absurd, really—how much brighter everything seemed now that she could kiss Rio. The act itself wasn’t new to her, but <em> this </em> was. Rio’s mouth. Rio’s eyes, dark and steady, filling the spaces in Agatha’s chest that had long since gone hollow. Somehow, the whole world had shifted. They made a full batch of sweet treats and devoured them with another blend of Rio’s tea while a low-volume documentary played in the background. Eventually, they collapsed onto the couch—half-sitting, half-sprawled, limbs tangled, bodies aligned. They didn’t even pretend to watch the screen. They held each other, spoke softly, and listened with their whole bodies. It was intimate in a way Agatha had never known. Not sexual, but real. Steady. Close. She had known sex—sex was easy, mechanical, a shortcut to feeling something when nothing else worked. But this? This softness, this warmth, this shared silence with no demand hiding beneath it? She had expected it to be hard. Vulnerability always was. But instead, it felt as effortless as breathing. Maybe it was just Rio, or maybe it was them together that simply made sense. Agatha didn’t know. All she knew was that <em> this </em> felt incredible, and she wanted to keep <em> this </em> at any cost.</p><p>They were lounging on the couch, Agatha’s head pillowed on Rio’s chest. She completely gave up pretending to pay attention to the documentary on the screen, succumbing to the euphoria of being enveloped by the woman beside her. The steady rhythm of her heartbeat and measured breaths was comforting, and Agatha felt as if she was about to doze off. She had only ever taken naps when Nicky was a baby. He was always wild, just like Agatha, and struggled with sleep, so Agatha’s history of not sleeping properly began much earlier than anyone thought. During that time, she would sneak in a few hours of sleep whenever possible. She hadn’t napped since, but Rio felt warm and soft beneath her, and she was full of sweet treats, and warm tea, and she couldn’t fight it. Didn’t want to. Rio was running her fingers through her hair, scratching her scalp with maddening tenderness, and it felt far too good. Agatha was surprised to discover that she actually enjoyed it—she never thought she was into her hair being touched or pulled. Yet, every day, Rio was unveiling something new to her. About herself, about comfort, about what it meant to be held without consequence.</p><p>The noise of the outside world began to fade as the veil of shifting energy closed around her, luring her mind into the realm of dreams, but then Rio spoke. “I’ve never been in a real relationship.” Her tone was soft and low, and Agatha’s dream-soaked brain folded the words into a fantasy, like a line from some imagined version of the documentary, unfolding at the edges of her consciousness. “I think this is vital information. You should know.” Okay, so maybe not a dream.</p><p>“‘Mkay,” Agatha mumbled, her face buried in the soft cotton of Rio’s shirt, her lips grazing warm skin beneath. She nuzzled. It smelled like something sweet, and sandalwood, and just Rio.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “Okay?” She swept her hair aside from her face, which hung like a curtain, her fingertips lingering on her cheek, and Agatha frowned at the light attempting to seep through her closed eyelids. She burrowed closer, tucking herself into the crook of Rio’s neck like a cat seeking heat, and hummed contentedly. Rio kissed the crown of her head and murmured, “I’ll let you sleep then, mi amor.” </p><p>The pet name somehow pulled her out of the limbo between the realms, and she smiled into Rio’s skin. “Mm,” she murmured, “am I your first, Dr. Vidal?” She felt rather than heard Rio’s breath catch, and her arm draped around Agatha’s back tensed just slightly.</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be poetic?” Rio replied, light and airy—but Agatha knew her now. She <em> heard </em> the undercurrent. But, yes, it would, it really, really would. Agatha wished she could erase all he previous encounters with other people, so that she could only ever belong to Rio. “Sadly, no.” <em> Sadly </em>. So, Rio felt the same way about this. It made Agarha warm within. Her smile widened, and she pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s neck. “I’ve been with a couple of people when I was younger. Curious like everyone else. But I...” she trailed, choosing the right words, and Agatha wanted to tell her that there are no “right” and “wrong” words when it came to her. “I'm not a fling type—don’t do one-night-stands or casual hookups. If I’m in, I want to be in all the way. But you could probably guess that girls don’t really dream of ending up with someone like me—emotionally unavailable, and unable to understand them in the way they need.” She said it casually; her tone was almost clinical, revealing no emotion behind it. Not for the first time, Agatha wondered if that was something traumatic for Rio or if she didn’t regard it in any special way, like most things.</p><p>“Well, those girls can eat my ass,” Agatha snarled because <em> what the fuck </em> Rio was so amazing; she couldn’t fathom anyone treating this wonderful, kind soul unfairly, and the thought alone was boiling her blood. “They just didn’t know how to cook you,” she said, drawing a snort out of Rio. She was overjoyed that they could kiss now because she had always wanted to at moments like this, when Rio was being adorable or making those cute little sounds. And so she did—she pressed her lips to Rio’s neck in a tender, closed-lips peck, followed by a couple more kisses up the length, until she reached her jaw. She pressed another kiss there. “You understand me just fine.”</p><p>Rio’s hand was in her hair again. She tugged at it very, very gently to prompt Agatha to look at her, and when she did, Rio pressed their lips together. “That’s because you are a freak, too,” she whispered into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, smirking. “Well, that freak appears to be the ideal match for yours, so should you really be complaining?” she teased.</p><p>“I’m not complaining,” Rio smiled, scratching at her scalp, and drawing a happy purr. “Just wanted to touch base. That, as far as sex goes, I don’t really have that much practical experience.” Agatha shifted, supporting herself on her elbow, so she could maintain eye contact. <em> Why did this sound like an issue? </em> She frowned. “You would have to be patient while I’m learning this new skillset,” Rio added quietly. Ah, <em> okay, no </em>, Agatha was not having this—Rio should never feel like she isn’t enough, that was unacceptable. </p><p>“I’m not in this for the sex, Rio,” she said, voice warm and steady. That was true—she really meant it. She just wanted Rio, and sex was simply a nice bonus. She cupped her cheek and continued, “I’m in this for you. I just want to be in your orbit—hold your hand, talk to you, and do things together. I just want to live my life with you beside me.” Her tone had softened. She ran her thumb along Rio’s skin and leaned in for a gentle kiss on the lips, feeling overjoyed once again that she could do that. “But when it comes to it, I’m sure a doctor can figure out how hard, how long, and from which angle to touch my clit to make me come,” she whispered sultry, feeling Rio’s hands twitch, and her grip tighenen ever so slightly. “And if not, I’ll show you. It’s not a big deal.” She kissed her one more time, quick and easy. Intimate. Domestic. </p><p>Rio’s brown eyes were bright and wide, filled with hope, joy, and something else Agatha pretended not to notice at that moment. “Yeah?” she whispered back.</p><p>Agatha smiled, switching back to soft again, “It’s not rocket science, darling. I have faith in you.” She used Rio’s words from earlier, and the effect was immediate—Rio lit up, like something inside her clicked into place. She leaned in and rubbed their noses together. Agatha was suddenly reminded of a time when she was sick and they were watching a documentary about seahorses. She felt her heart grow in size.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio murmured, and Agatha had to kiss her again—deeper this time. More promise, more burn, but still anchored in that impossible sweetness.</p><p>She was becoming addicted to Rio’s kisses. She kissed with the focus and precision of someone writing code—much like conducting a scientific experiment or tackling a complex math problem. It was desire in another form, one that Agatha had absolutely no clue existed. It was desire, yet Rio didn’t let her hands wander too much. Which was either because she was being respectful, or… </p><p>When they parted for air, Agatha didn’t immediately dive back in. She lingered, breath still close to Rio’s, but pulled away just enough to look at her. She was so pretty like this: hair mussed from lying back on the couch, mussed more by Agatha’s wandering fingers, eyes half-lidded with pupils blown wide. Her lips were flushed, swollen from their kisses, and slightly parted in a breathless daze. Agatha reached out and traced her face with her fingertips as if trying to memorize it. “Rio?” she asked quietly, barely above a whisper, as if even the softness of her voice might break the delicate, golden thread of warmth between them. Rio hummed, her eyes blinking open, alert again. “Are you asexual?”</p><p>She froze for a split second. Then her gaze, still locked on Agatha's, deepened—sharp and assessing. Not defensive. Just… thoughtful. She was estimating the question the same way she approached everything: directly and honestly. “I actually have never thought about it,” she frowned slightly. “I don’t think I am—I experience desire occasionally. It’s just fairly rare. I can function perfectly fine without sex. I don’t require it as much as some people, but it doesn’t feel unpleasant. So, I suppose no, I’m not asexual. When you get to a certain age, you just become more chill, I’m sure you have noticed.” Her eyes were still scanning Agatha’s face. “Are you?”</p><p>Agatha loved this. She loved that they could talk about these things so plainly, so precisely, without shame. Loved that Rio met her closeness with curiosity instead of concern or defense. And talking about these things with Rio, who had a scientific, analytical approach toward everything in life, made it even easier.</p><p>“For me, it wasn’t aging that cooled my libido down,” she said, voice calm now, confessional in tone. “After Nicky, divorce, moving… after everything that happened, my sole focus shifted to the company. I was so absorbed that I hadn’t even noticed when exactly sex became irrelevant to me. Before, I used to indulge in some sinful scenarios,” she admitted sheepishly because now her sexual achievements suddenly felt somewhat embarrassing. Because now she knew none of those were real intimacy. “So, definitely not asexual. It’s just at some point in time, I turned into one of those people who are called married-to-work.”</p><p>“How about now?” Rio asked gently.</p><p>“I’m not at work now,” she said, looking her directly in the eye. “And I’m very much not thinking about work now.”</p><p>For a moment, the only response was the twitch at the corners of Rio’s mouth, a tell-tale spark of amusement. “What are you thinking about now?” she asked with a carefree playfulness. And, honestly? Agatha was not thinking about anything in particular. At last, her mind was not spiraling. Despite everything she <em> could </em> be obsessing over, her mind was miraculously quiet.</p><p>“I think,” Agatha said slowly, reaching for Rio’s hand where it had been resting in her hair, “that if you’re not asexual…” She guided Rio’s hand down the curve of her neck, her skin tingling beneath the contact. “You should not be afraid to touch me more.” Her voice was silk over steel. She continued moving Rio’s hand around, slow but unyielding, until it came to rest between her breasts, right over the steady thrum of her heart. She could feel Rio’s breath catch—a sharp inhale sliced the stillness. Rio’s eyes followed the movement, zeroing in on their joined hands on Agatha’s chest, her fingers twitched, but she didn’t pull away.     </p><p>“I am being respectful of your boundaries,” she said quietly, raising her eyes.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha began, intending firmness, but it slipped into a low, amused chuckle. “You bride-carried me to bed, wearing a shirt that barely covered your body the second time we saw each other in person.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened like she’d been caught stealing from the altar. “That’s different!” she squeaked. Agatha had never heard her make that sound before. It was painfully cute. “Those were special circumstances,” Rio added quickly, blushing slightly. “Also, you were not supposed to remember that, considering how high your temperature was.”</p><p>“Oh, I remembered,” she purred, letting her hand slide off Rio’s and trail leisurely up her arm, fingers skating under the sleeve of the t-shirt and over bare skin until they curled around her biceps. Agatha’s smirk deepened. “It’s hard to forget <em> these, </em>” she added, giving the muscle a gentle squeeze. Rio whined. She whined. Agatha beamed, absolutely victorious. She stared at Rio’s wide, stunned eyes for a beat longer before showing mercy and letting go of her arm. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you after that day,” she confessed, softer now, the heat giving way to something more vulnerable. “I couldn’t get you out of my mind before that, but that day… I think it broke something in me.”</p><p>Rio’s expression shifted—alert, concerned. “Broke?” she asked.</p><p>“In a way.” It was Agatha’s turn to tuck a strand of Rio’s hair behind her ear. It had become their thing, somehow—an unspoken gesture for safety. She let her knuckles drift along Rio’s cheekbone afterward, slow and reverent, and felt the other woman lean ever so slightly into the touch, visibly relaxing. “But not in a bad way. It was like after that day, I finally allowed myself to think about you,” she said softly.</p><p>“I acknowledged I was attracted to you more than just slightly that day, too,” Rio murmured, and Agatha’s heart set aflame, sending butterflies to her stomach and spreading warmth within every cell of her essence.</p><p>“And how long have you been attracted to me, Dr. Vidal?” Agatha teased, her eyes glittered. <em> Yes </em> , she had a thing for Rio’s title, <em> so what? Sue her. </em>And it seemed that Rio had a thing for Agatha, having a thing for her title, too, if her sharp intakes of air every time Agatha called her doctor were any indication.</p><p>“Pretty much from day one,” she replied sincerely. “There was something about you…. I don’t know… Your bright, sharp, calculating eyes that were just a little bit sad with permanent sadness.” Agatha’s breath caught, but Rio pressed on, gentle and steady. “All those awards on your walls,” she said, “yet not a single personal photo on your desk. I felt your loneliness right away because my own was reaching for it, recognizing familiar energy. It was as if we were reuniting and not meeting for the first time.” Agatha blinked, struck dumb by the weight of it. She swallowed, trying to stay afloat in the swell of emotion, in the aching familiarity of Rio’s words.</p><p>“I lingered that first night, waiting for you,” she admitted, the words catching slightly in her throat. Her fingers fidgeted with the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, where her hand was still pressed between her breasts. “That’s how the whole thing with the notes came to be. I thought if I can’t see you again, I at least try to talk to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lowered, her lashes casting shadows on her cheeks. “And I was never replying…”</p><p>“And you were never replying,” Rio gave a small, breathy laugh—one without her usual joy. “But I knew you were reading them and that was enough for that time.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow creased, a ripple of regret visible in the furrow between her eyes. She covered Rio’s hand on her chest, rubbing her thumb absentmindedly over the soft skin. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled by the sincerity of it, “For what?”</p><p>“For making it hard on you,” Agatha murmured, eyes lifting again. They were glassy, wide, filled with so many emotions that hadn’t yet spilled. Agatha didn’t expect the sudden motion—Rio leaning forward, hand rising to cup her cheek with a gentle urgency, as if the contact might ease the ache between them. Her palm was warm, steady. Agatha instinctively leaned into it.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice tight with emotion, “it would’ve surprised me if it were easy.” The air seemed to still around them, and as the weight of that settled, Rio’s thumb brushed lightly along the edge of Agatha’s jaw, as if to reassure her that she was real. That <em> this </em> was real. “You are exquisite,” she continued, and her words felt carefully chosen. “I knew from the start that I’d have to work hard for a chance with you.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a shaky inhale, lips parted slightly. Her heart pressed hard against her ribs, thudding like it wanted to speak for her. She tried anyway. “And you still wanted to go for it?” she whispered, disbelief catching in her tone like a splinter. “Why?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t waver. Not for a second. There was no hesitation. No caveat or clever deflection. Just truth—simple, seismic. “Because you are worth it.”</p><p><em> Worth it </em>. Agatha was uncertain whether she knew how to apply these words to herself. Had she ever been worth it to anyone? She expected her thoughts to break into the usual spiral, to unravel her by habit. But instead, her attention stayed tethered to the sensation of Rio’s palms—warm and steady—and to the way those dark eyes held her as if she were sacred, as if this moment was sacred. After taking some deep breaths and blinking repeatedly, she found her mind still comfortably enveloped in Rio’s soothing warmth. “You make me feel so at peace,” she confessed at last, her voice unguarded, almost defensive in how soft it sounded.</p><p>“Then why does it sound like a bad thing?” Rio asked. There was concern, yet it was expressed with subtle undertones of affection—so delicate that Agatha was sure only she could recognize it. It was exclusively meant for her; her soul instinctively traced the path of its energy, akin to a current. She didn’t need to see or hear. Only feel. It was embedded in her bones. She finally found the missing screw she had been searching for, the crucial element of her previously labeled ‘factory-damaged essence’.</p><p>“Not a bad thing. It’s just…” she paused. How was she supposed to explain the landscape of her mind to someone else? Her mind replied to this instantly—it was Rio—she didn’t have to sand down the edges. She could speak exactly as she was, without translation. There was never a need to present the words differently or make them easier for consumption, because that was Rio, and Rio would always understand her. “I’ve been spiraling my entire life. Not as bad when I was younger, but when everything happened… Is it weird that in my mind, I refer to that period as ‘when I died’?” she asked.</p><p>Rio was still next to her, eyes searching as usual. She just looked at Agatha for a long moment as if trying to merge with her, and then shifted so they could sit properly instead of half-lounging. Her arm curved around Agatha’s lower back with effortless support, guiding them to sit up together. And when they were upright, grounded in the space between each other, she finally said, “No.” Simple as that. One word. One syllable. The whole great meaning.</p><p>Agatha nodded as if encouraging herself to keep going. Yet, truth be told, she didn’t need any encouragement now. A three-month-ago Agatha would never have even entertained the idea of speaking about something as deep as that with another person. But this Agatha? This Agatha felt like sharing the depths of her soul with Rio was the most natural thing in the world. Also, overdue. “When I finally managed to claw my way out of that quick-sand of agony, I dissolved my entire essence in work,” she said, taking measured breaths and keeping the calm, neutral tone. Although she was feeling chills prickling inside, as that was the first time she had ever said those things aloud, shared those things with another being. “Work kept me busy, my mind was constantly focused on business, and I didn’t have time to wander. I was working non-stop, and by the time I got home, I was too exhausted to think. I would just crash. That exhaustion… it protected me. Even when there was room to spiral, I was too tired to fall.”</p><p>Rio was listening carefully, her head tilted slightly to the left. Agatha had noticed sometime ago that Rio preferred to receive important information, especially when it was Agatha opening up, with her right ear. She was unsure which difference it made, but it seemed to make a difference for Rio. And she was doing it now, which meant she was seriously invested. Her lips parted slightly, but no sound came at first. She narrowed her eyes just a bit, and Agatha immediately recognized the silent question. Rio was asking her permission to engage. It still felt bizarre to Agatha how they, in such a short period of time, learned to read each other so precisely. Her head moved in a half-nod—Rio would understand. “Are you afraid of stopping?” she finally asked Agatha.</p><p>“Yes.” One word. One syllable. The whole great meaning. “I’m terrified that if I stop moving, I’ll get pulled back into that swamp. That thick, suffocating sorrow.” She took a deep breath, shaking her head slightly. “Even though—intellectually—I know it’s been years. And truthfully, it doesn’t even hurt the way it used to. It’s dulled. Blurred. Like background noise. But it’s <em> always </em> there. Like static under everything.” She reached for Rio’s hand, which was calmly resting on her thigh, still. Agatha ran her fingers along Rio’s gently. “And this is what I meant,” she continued. “When I said you make me feel at peace. When I’m with you, the noise goes quiet. The background fades, and my mind isn’t spiralling. It isn’t bad, it is just very foreign. I don’t remember a version of myself that ever felt this safe.” She looked up. Rio’s eyes had gone wide, sparkling—luminous with a joy so soft it hurt to look at. It kept astonishing Agatha how <em> this </em> could make Rio that happy. How <em> she </em> could be the source of it. “You make me feel safe,” she murmured.</p><p>She felt Rio’s hand shift under her fingers, and when she looked down, she saw her hand flipped palm up now, inviting. Agatha’s lips twitched, and she placed her hand in Rio’s, who immediately intertwined their fingers. It was embarrassing how happy it made her. Ridiculous, even—how their hands could touch and it still felt like an awakening. They were grown women, far beyond the age of flutters and giddy thrills. And yet… here they were—aching for each other like a couple of teenagers who had never touched anyone before. It felt freeing.</p><p>“For me, it is the opposite.” Rio’s voice interrupted her blissful train of thought. “My mind comes alive when I’m with you.” Her thumb began its familiar ministrations on the back of Agatha’s hand, and suddenly she hated how far away they were. They were sitting so close together that their thighs touched, but it wasn’t enough. Agatha needed a full-body contact, or at least her head pressed into Rio’s chest, melting into her, and trying to become one substance with her bloodstream. </p><p>“You make me feel at peace with what I am, yes,” Rio clarified. “But physiologically, I think you noticed, I am always far too peaceful.” Agatha had noticed. Rio could sit staring at a spot on the wall for probably hours, if Agatha didn’t speak. It has never been an uncomfortable silence with Rio; it was just motionless—like she was made of stone or spirit. Most people would have called it eerie. Agatha had always found it profound. Beautiful, in its own strange gravity. “And whenever I’m still like that, my mind is still, too.” Agatha was wondering what was happening in her head during those moments. She assumed Rio was spiraling in her own way, too, but it turned out she was just in the state of here and now. Present. Always. “When we first met, I was surprised to discover that my mind has a setting of never shutting up,” she chuckled and squeezed her hand gently. Agatha squeezed back. “I mostly think about you,” Rio confessed. “What could I cook for you that you would enjoy, or what kind of music would resonate with your mood on the particular day, or what shade are your eyes…” she paused for a moment, and Agatha frowned. <em> Her eyes? </em> “Did you know that your eyes have different shades depending on your mood?” Agatha did not know that. “They are more blue when you’re happy. But they turn a cooler grey if you’re scared.” Agatha felt said eyes widen. Rio reached out and brushed her thumb under her eye, grazing the soft skin tenderly. “And I want to be there for both,” she murmured. “For the happiness. For the fear. I want to hold your hand when you’re lost, and share your joy when you find your way again.” Her voice softened even further. “I know you loathe clichés, but I‘ve never felt anything like this before. My mind has always been still. But you awakened it somehow.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to ask whether that was a bad or a good thing; she parted her lips, but Rio was already speaking again. “It surprised me at first, took me off guard, and concerned me a little. But then I let myself analyze it,” she trailed off. Of course, Rio would analyze that. Agatha felt a fond smile tugging at her lips. “And I must admit,” Rio declared with quiet certainty, “I rather like it.”</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Dinner felt different. This was the first time Rio cooked for her, not because of the professional obligation, though Agatha doubted that was ever the case—it felt personal almost from the very beginning, but as her… partner? They haven’t discussed the semantics, Agatha didn’t even know if they needed to. ​​It really didn’t matter as long as Rio was with her. <em> Hers </em>. She was here. In her kitchen. In her life. And she had chosen to be.</p><p>Rio was making the same meal she had made for her all these months ago for that first test-drive dinner—pasta bolognese with lean beef meatballs, her signature creamy broccoli with spinach, and some parmesan. She expressed a desire to redefine its meaning, transforming it into something that holds significance for both of them. However, Agatha believed it had always been meaningful in that way.</p><p>Agatha had dreamed of this. Quietly, secretly. She remembered watching Rio cook in this very space that day when she was sick and wishing—aching—that it could be like this. That one day, Rio would be here not because she was paid to be, but because she <em> wanted </em> to be. And now that it was real, Agatha didn’t know where to put all the happiness spilling out of her. So she stopped trying to contain it. She pushed off the bar stool where she'd been half-sitting, watching Rio with something close to reverence as she plated with her usual meticulous calm. It was intimate, almost sacred, the way Rio moved in her kitchen. Like she belonged here. Like the space had always been waiting for her. Agatha moved before she thought. Her arms slipped around Rio’s waist from behind, possessive and soft all at once. She tucked her face into the warm crook between shoulder and neck and inhaled deeply.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, “Sometimes you’re just like a cat.” Agatha made a faint, pleased sound—half purr—nuzzling up her neck and placing a delicate kiss on her cheek.</p><p>“And? You like cats,” she smiled into her warm skin.</p><p>Rio softly leaned back from her embrace, turning to face her while resting her hands on her front. “Don’t distract me,” she said with a grin, beginning to apply pressure to her chest, but Agatha didn’t budge. “You’re like a immovable object and an unstoppable force combined,” Rio laughed, dropping her forehead next to her hands.</p><p>Agatha just pressed closer, ignoring the gentle push to her chest. “And?” she said mock-annoyed with a smirk.</p><p>“And mean,” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>It was Agatha's turn to laugh—a real one, breathy and unguarded. “You are totally into it,” she teased, tightening her arms until Rio’s body molded into hers like two puzzle pieces finally fitting. She felt more than heard the contented sigh from where Rio was snuggled against her.</p><p>“I have no idea how we managed to find each other,” Rio mumbled, muffled against her chest, “but I’m definitely not complaining.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I think I do have an idea how we found each other.” Rio lifted her head slightly, curious. ”Our friends must have a hand at that.” Agatha, never breaking eye contact, slid one of her hands from where it was draped around Rio’s waist to capture hers sandwiched between their bodies. “You said you retired three years ago,” she murmured, voice velvet-soft now. “So, how did we get here again?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Lilia said there was a new account and no one else was available that day. Nobody she trusted. I think she was just a little intimidated. Since… you’re <em> you </em>. PR goddess. Reputation speaks for you. Dangerous, etcetera.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, fond and biting. “Lilia Calderu? Intimidated? Please.” Her tone was dry, but her eyes were gleaming. She looked at Rio in awe. How could a bright mind like hers also be so naive? She wanted to kiss that sincerity off her face. When Rio frowned, searching her eyes, Agatha didn’t hold herself back any longer, leaning in and pecking the tip of her nose. “Lilia is friends with one of my close friends, Alice. I’d bet money this whole thing was orchestrated,” she said.</p><p>“Oh?” Rio gaped at her. Then her frown softened, and the corners of her lips twitched. “Thanks?” she said, chuckling. Agatha’s face softened. She couldn’t help it. <em> God </em>, she was beautiful like this—sweet and flushed and laughing like she belonged here. Like they had always belonged like this. Rio was so adorable. Agatha just wanted to hold her and never let go. And suddenly she realized that nothing was stopping her from doing so.</p><p>“It doesn’t bother you?” she whispered, brushing her lips against the crown of Rio’s head. “That our hands might’ve been… guided?” She felt Rio shake her head slightly.</p><p>“No,” she murmured. “We would never have approached one another successfully in the natural habitat. Immovable object and unstoppable force. I’m sure we would’ve missed each other otherwise.” Agatha supposed that was true. The chances of them meeting naturally were close to zero, and even if they did, Agatha knew neither of them would’ve approached. Both of them were built differently—defensive, suspicious, and unavailable, yet secretly longing for love. Maybe it <em> had </em> taken a little divine meddling to break through. So, she should actually be thanking their friends if they had anything to do with it. Or the stars for aligning just right. </p><p>Rio was still in her arms, still and steady, and the weight of her there made something in Agatha's chest unclench. She kissed the side of her head, lingering. Rio made a soft, helpless noise, nuzzling deeper into Agatha’s shirt like she wanted to disappear into her skin. Agatha smiled—slow and aching and full of something that hurt too much to name. <em>Who’s the cat now? </em>She held her like that, letting the moment stretch out like a warm marshmallow between them. She realized then that nothing was stopping her from holding Rio like this every night. From being the one she came home to. From being the one Rio chose again and again and again. Her fingers curled protectively over Rio’s hand, as if by holding it, she could tether the entire universe in place. She didn’t say any of the things clawing at her throat. But she <em>felt</em> them. Every single one. And Rio, pressed into her chest, just breathed. As if she felt them too. Agatha liked this—how they could switch the dominance dynamics so easily, and she couldn’t help but wonder whether that would transfer into the bedroom, too.</p><p>Dinner was amazing—not just the food, although the food was, as always, an almost religious experience—but the entire ritual of it. The rhythm of shared plates, the quiet clinks of silverware, and low laughter, the unmistakable warmth of Rio across the table. It didn’t matter how many nights like this they’d had. Somehow, each one still felt significant. Agatha wondered if it would ever stop feeling this way—this good. She hoped not. She couldn’t imagine wanting anything less than this glow in her chest, the low thrum of happiness stitched between bites of broccoli and banter. “When I had the first bite of this meal that first night,” she said, gaze lingering on her plate, her voice soft with memory, “I’m not going to lie—I wanted to kidnap you and trap you in my kitchen forever.” She chuckled, like it was just a joke, like her fork hadn’t nearly trembled in her hand.</p><p>Across from her, Rio smiled. Not with surprise. Not even with teasing. Just this quiet, unflinching certainty. “I would’ve gone willingly,” she said, tone light, like she was offering a refill of wine. “All you had to do was ask.” Agatha looked up sharply, brow arching. But Rio just shrugged, as if it were obvious. As if her saying <em> yes </em> to forever was casual. Like she hadn’t just disarmed Agatha with four words and the steady, unbearable calm in her eyes. This woman was impossible. Agatha was torn between wanting to scream and kiss her. Rio tilted her head. “Please eat your food,” she added, with all the gentle authority of someone who meant it. “Don’t talk while chewing.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Why, excuse my manners, Dr. Vidal,” she mocked, a smile curling at her lips.</p><p>Rio’s gaze zeroed in on her; she looked unimpressed. “One of the reasons you get bloated is because you swallow air,” she stated, her tone clinical. “You swallow air when your mouth is open while chewing, breathing, or when you speak too fast.” <em> Wait what? </em>Agatha opened her mouth to reply, but nothing came out. She just stared at Rio, dumbstruck. Rio giggled, like she was fifteen and delighted by her own mischief. “Yeah, I was shocked too when I learned that.” Agatha was, against her better judgment, floored. Not because she didn’t believe her, but because… how the hell did Rio always know such things? The woman was a real-life Wikipedia. Agatha has never considered herself a know-it-all. While she was intelligent and had considerable life experience in various areas, she continuously learned new things from Rio. Whether it was domestic advice, scientific facts, or cultural insights, Agatha often found it absurd—these were things she felt she should have already known, yet she was only now discovering them. And every time it happened, something inside her cracked open a little more.</p><p>A sudden wave of emotion washed over her. She found herself looking at Rio again. Warm eyes, bright mind, and steady hands. Agatha didn’t want the night to end. She couldn’t bear the idea of Rio walking out the door and taking all that energy with her. “Today was perfect,” she said softly, looking at Rio with so much affection she was sure was borrowed because there was no way she could contain so much within herself.</p><p>“It really was,” Rio beamed in reply.</p><p>She swallowed thickly, the emotion sitting heavy in her throat. “Thank you,” she murmured, her voice naked and sincere. She rarely said that. But when she did—she meant it fullheartedly. Rio shifted to stand up, and Agatha got jolted by panic that she might leave. She wasn’t sure where so much possessiveness came from, but it mixed perfectly with that unwillingness to let Rio go, and before she could think or stop herself, her hand shot out, fingers wrapping around Rio’s wrist—not tightly, but firmly. Rio turned back to her, eyes wide with a flicker of confusion, but she didn’t pull away. She just… waited. Agatha stood, her breath came unevenly. She wasn’t sure what she was doing, only that the idea of letting go was unbearable. Without speaking, she pulled Rio gently into the living room, the world narrowing to the warmth at her back, the certainty of this one person who never asked for explanations. She turned. Placed a firm hand on Rio’s waist, while the other found her shoulder. And then, without ceremony, she pressed her down onto the couch. Rio let her. She didn’t flinch. She didn’t question.</p><p>Agatha climbed into her lap, straddling her with reverent intent. No preamble—just a kind of hunger that had nothing to do with lust and everything to do with closeness, with knowing, with longing<em> . </em>Rio’s hands didn’t move. Her breathing didn’t change. She just stayed still as always, listening to Agatha’s breath, scanning her face, decoding her. She was looking up at her like she was watching a constellation take shape across her ceiling. That look—that precise focus—it always unraveled Agatha.</p><p>“You’re impossible,” Agatha muttered, voice uneven, her hands fisting slightly in the hem of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “You dragged me in here and manhandled me,” she said calmly.</p><p>“And?” Agatha said, leaning forward so their foreheads touched. Her voice dropped to a murmur. “You’re still impossible.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft breath of laughter, “I’m literally just sitting.”</p><p>“You’re being <em> you. </em> It’s infuriating,” Agatha whispered. “You sit there with your fun scientific facts, and your calm demeanor, and your steady gaze, and I—” her voice broke. “I don’t want you to leave,” she admitted. The admission was terrifying. But she didn’t draw it back.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she brought one hand to Agatha’s waist. The other slid up her back, slow and sure, as if to anchor her. “I’m not going anywhere,” she said quietly. “But I will have to retreat home eventually tonight.” That made Agatha’s eyes sting. She reached out and held Rio’s face in her hands. Her skin was impossibly soft, bare without any foundation or powder. Agatha, lost in a wave of feeling too thick to swim through, leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>It was soft at first. The kind of kiss that said thank you, and I’ve been waiting for you my entire life, and I have no idea how to survive without you—all in one breath. Their mouths brushed once, again, then deeper—the rhythm languid, greedy, patient, and desperate all at once. Agatha threaded her fingers through Rio’s hair and tilted her head, pressing in harder, chasing the warmth of her mouth like it could soothe the ache that had built and built for weeks. Agatha kissed her like she meant it. Because she had meant to do this for weeks. One hand slid down to cradle Rio’s jaw, her thumb grazing the corner of her mouth as their kiss turned hungry. The kind of hunger that tasted like longing denied too long, like promises half-made and temptation pulling taut under the skin. Agatha kissed her like a woman possessed now—slow, molten, starving. Rio’s lips parted, and Agatha gasped against her, the heat between them rushing into every empty space inside her. She couldn’t remember the last time she had <em> needed </em> someone like this. Not just for the body, not just for the heat—but for the <em> anchor </em> of it. Rio’s mouth moved with hers, steady and generous, like she’d already memorized how Agatha liked to be kissed. </p><p>Agatha’s hands roamed without permission—one in Rio’s curls, the other slipping beneath the hem of her shirt to touch bare, warm skin. The contact made her groan. She pulled herself closer, chest pressed to chest, thighs squeezing around Rio’s hips like she could dissolve into her if she just tried hard enough. And Rio let her. She didn’t push her away. She didn’t tense or retreat. She let Agatha chase it—every kiss, every sigh, every greedy slide of her hands—and Agatha lost herself in it completely. Her mouth moved to Rio’s jaw, her neck, the spot just under her ear that made her pulse throb. She dragged her lips down the column of her throat and whispered something even she couldn’t understand—something desperate. She wanted, no, needed, more. She wanted to drown in her. She wanted to take Rio to bed, undress her slowly, kiss every inch of her body until she forgot her own name.</p><p>She slid her hand higher beneath the shirt, fingertips brushing the soft curve of her breast just under her sports-bra, and felt Rio suck in a breath. Her fingers flexed at her waist. “Agatha…”</p><p>“I know,” she murmured, still kissing her. “I know, we agreed. But I…” Her mouth drifted to Rio’s cheek, her jaw, her neck. “You’re already mine.”</p><p>Rio’s breath stuttered, hips shifting. Agatha rocked into her, just slightly. Rio’s hands flew up and held Agatha’s arms. Not harsh—it wasn’t rejection. Not scolding—just enough to anchor, to steady her. “Agatha…” she said more urgently now. Agatha’s breath caught. Her heart pounded in her throat. She pulled back half an inch and rested her forehead against Rio’s, panting. Her chest ached. Rio’s hand reached for her face, and she brushed her thumb over Agatha’s cheekbone. “One date is all I’m asking,” she murmured. “One date so that I can present my intentions before the great forces of the cosmos.” <em> Oh, come on! Goddammit, Rio, and her perfect wording. </em> Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>She nodded slowly in surrender. They stayed like this—foreheads pressed together, breathing each other in. Agatha felt the white swirls of storm within her begin to subside. Violent wind and roaring thunder turned into gentle breeze and quiet rain. She leaned forward and buried her face in Rio’s neck again, not to seduce, just to stay close. Rio’s arms wrapped around her torso, and she just held her. No rush. No judgment. Just her hands cradling Agatha’s spine like a promise.</p><p>“I’m still not letting you go home, just so you know,” Agatha whispered, still a little breathless, still trembling with the force of everything she hadn’t done yet.</p><p>“Is that so?” Rio whispered back.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and pulled back just enough to look at her. Rio was examining her with that maddening, unreadable calm. Like she could see straight through every trick Agatha had ever learned, every defense, every fear. “Mhm,” Agatha murmured, kissing the corner of her mouth. “Totally keeping you hostage overnight.” She nuzzled closer, pressing another kiss to her cheek. “I promise to behave.”</p><p>She felt Rio exhale, a long, shaky breath against her neck. “Agatha,” she rasped, shifting her hands from Agatha’s back to her chest, palms firm and warm, gently applying pressure until there was the smallest distance between them—barely an inch, but it felt like a chasm. Agatha caught her breath and moved her hands, catching Rio’s wrists—not to pull her closer, just to hold onto something grounding.</p><p>“Look,” she started, voice low, “I’m not exactly sure how your desire works, but I have a lot of trust in you,” she tried, reckless in her negotiation. Her pulse was still hammering from where Rio had just touched her.</p><p>Rio cast her a glance—simultaneously passionate and rueful—and let out a soft, devastating chuckle. “Agatha,” she murmured. “I want you just as much as you want me,” she said sultry, making Agatha gasp. “And that’s exactly why I need to retreat now. You may have trust in me, but I don't. I won’t be able to lie next to you in one bed and not touch you.” Her eyes were burning into Agatha’s, setting a wildfire within her.</p><p>“Yeah, you need to leave,” she said breathlessly. “You’re not helping at all.” Rio grinned, not sorry at all, and reached down to squeeze her thighs—slow, assured, possessive. Agatha sighed and started dismantling her. Tragic. A tragedy, really. Truly.</p><p>‧₊˚ ୧☕︎𓌉◯𓇋♨੭₊˚⋅</p><p>Agatha was lounging in bed after her long, hot shower. Her damp hair curling against her neck, and the hem of her silk robe rucked up a little. Her body still buzzed—echoes of hands that weren’t hers, lips that hadn’t been on her skin for far too long. Rio had left almost an hour ago, and the quiet had started to feel maddening. She kept drifting back ​​to the taste of Rio’s kisses, the sound of her laugh, the way her voice dropped like a storm cloud when she got serious. Today has been intense. Over three—almost four—months of build-up have finally unraveled. Agatha was struggling to wrap her mind around the fact that all those events happened in just one day. It was a lot to take in. Yet, she came to the realization that her mind was uncharacteristically calm. She felt at peace with herself and her desires. And, boy, did she have desires. Agatha couldn’t remember if she had ever wanted anyone like that. And it was not just about sex. It was maddening. She hated that Rio left. She hated that future date—they didn’t need it, but how could she deprive Rio of that? How was she supposed to learn to be a supportive partner if she couldn’t even give Rio that small thing? And Agatha wanted to be a supportive partner; she genuinely wanted to give Rio everything she wanted. Even if right now, it meant suffering. She sighed. She knew she was being dramatic, but in her defence, she hadn’t felt this horny in God knows how long—her body was simply overwhelmed with sensation. </p><p>Agatha was trying to focus on her book. She wasn’t succeeding—she didn’t even know what book she was reading, her eyes had been scanning the same paragraph over and over again for the past nine minutes. She groaned and dropped her head back into the headboard with a dull thud and pressed the book to her chest. A futile attempt at composure. <em> Utterly pathetic. </em> Then her phone rang. Her pulse spiked when she saw the caller ID— <em> Rio </em> . She answered without hesitation. “Hey,” she breathed, trying not to sound too eager, too wrecked, too feral<em>. </em></p><p>There was no warm, cheerful greeting on the other end of the line, contrary to her expectations. “I can’t stop thinking about you,” Rio’s voice was thick with emotion. Agatha felt the lightning bolt going through her chest, and something molten poured down her ribs. Rio sounded raw, unhinged—real.</p><p>“Shouldn’t have left,” she said with mock judgment. Her tone was composed, but inside she was burning with desire. She draped an arm behind her head. “Kind of cruel of you, actually,” she added, her tone teasing.</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily. “Don’t say things like that,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Say what?” she asked, voice dipping into something lazy, indulgent. “Facts?” She knew that teasing purr in her tone might have consequences, and she wanted to see how far she could push before Rio snapped.</p><p>There was a long pause. “You’re doing it on purpose,” Rio said softly. There was heat beneath the words, barely restrained. It curled into Agatha’s gut like a spark into dry leaves.</p><p>She shifted against the pillows, trying to control the sharp ache spreading through her thighs. “I was just making a point,” she said, feigning indifference. “If you didn’t want to deal with the aftermath of turning me down, you shouldn’t have kissed me like that on your way out.”</p><p>Rio made a low sound—half exasperated, half wounded. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “What? I’m wrong?”</p><p>“You’re mean,” Rio said.</p><p>That made her laugh, delighted. “Oh, sweetheart. This isn’t mean,” she purred. “You haven’t seen me being mean.”</p><p>A beat. Silence. Then Rio exhaled again, and this time Agatha could hear it—the breathlessness, the way it trembled with restraint. Like she was gripping the edge of something. “You really shouldn’t say things like that,” Rio repeated, voice lower now. Less warning, more plea.</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha teased, coy. “Darling, you’ll have to be more specific in your instructions.” She was having way too much fun with it.</p><p>“Talking like that,” Rio whispered. “You shouldn’t say things in <em> that </em> voice.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha tilted her head, suddenly intrigued. “You like this voice?”</p><p>There was a soft noise on the other end of the line. It wasn’t a word. It was a sound Rio made deep in her throat, like a yes that was too fragile to say out loud. Agatha stilled. Her smirk faltered, and her heart did a strange, terrible flip.<em> Oh. </em>Her mind caught up all at once, like snapping back into her body after falling too far into a dream. She could picture Rio wherever she was—pacing maybe, or curled up somewhere dark and quiet, holding the phone like it was her only anchor. Face flushed, thighs pressed together. Trying to be good. Trying to respect Agatha’s boundaries, which, if you asked Agatha, should not have been boundaries anymore. And here she was, pushing at her buttons blindly—without even realizing how far she’d already taken it.</p><p>“Are you…” Agatha’s breath caught. There was a silence so intense it prickled along her skin.</p><p>“I’ve never—” Rio started, then stopped. That alone made Agatha dizzy. Rio, who touched with reverence, who looked at her like she was scripture, who kissed like it was sacred—she’d never done this before. Not this kind of indulgent, unguarded release. Something deep in Agatha clenched.</p><p>“Well,” she said gently, her voice softer now, though still deliciously low, “will it help if I told you, I haven’t either?”</p><p>There was a soft, embarrassed laugh from Rio—barely audible, like she didn’t know how to proceed. Although she probably didn’t know, indeed. “Yeah,” she rasped.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha echoed, trying to sound calm while her pulse beat loudly in her ears. “So,” she murmured, returning to her previous velvety tone, one that apparently was driving Rio crazy. “What do we do now, pretty boy?” The silence that followed crackled with tension. She hadn’t meant to say that. It slipped out. But it landed. She felt it land. Rio made a sound that barely qualified as a breath. Agatha bit her lip, emboldened by the power laced inside that single, involuntary noise. She softened her tone, letting it go warm and low and coaxing. “Tell me what you’re doing. Right now.” Another pause.</p><p>“I’m lying on my bed,” Rio said, voice trembling with restraint. “Thinking about you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “What are you thinking?”</p><p>“I…” Rio gulped. And at that moment, Agatha realized that she was scared. Always calm and composed Rio—the same Rio who would always guide her through all her fears, no questions asked—was the one scared now. Agatha couldn’t rely on her to get them there this time. This time it had to be Agatha. It didn’t matter that she had never done this kind of intimacy before; it didn’t matter that she didn’t know how. What mattered was Rio on the other end of the line, shaking with both fear and desire. And Agatha had to find a way to navigate this new kind of dynamics with her. For her. For them.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, settling back into the pillows like a throne. Her whole body buzzed—every nerve ending alert, alive. “You were so fucking good tonight, Rio,” she murmured. “I couldn’t stop looking at you, couldn’t keep my hands to myself. You knew what you were doing, wearing that stupid shirt. And you knew what you were doing, saying all those devastating things.” </p><p>“I didn’t—” Rio faltered, flustered. “I didn’t mean to—”</p><p>“Oh, you didn’t mean to?” Agatha interrupted, letting a little bite into her voice. “You sat there looking like a fucking fantasy, feeding me food that touched my soul like you didn’t know exactly what kind of chaos you were causing.”</p><p>Rio whimpered. It made Agatha ache. “Agatha—”</p><p>“Shhh,” she said, and she could hear Rio fall silent instantly, obedient without thought. “You don’t have to say anything, baby. Just listen to my voice.” Agatha felt inspired.</p><p>Rio took another shaky breath. “Okay,” she whispered, barely audible.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and smiled. Oh, she was going to ruin her, and likely ruin herself in the process. She allowed a pause to slip in, just to catch her breath and gather her thoughts. She didn’t have that many thoughts, actually—just one. Her heart thumped loudly in her chest, and waves of arousal spread within her like molten lava. “I think I got turned on the moment you said you were a doctor,” she murmured. “And my mind’s been stuck there ever since.” She shifted, reaching for the nightstand and grabbing her earbuds—if they were doing this, she wanted to do it properly; she wanted both her hands available. Also, she didn’t trust herself to hold the phone as her hands were already shaking violently, and her heart hammering. She readjusted on the bed, pressing her back to the headboard and kicking the covers off her body. The skin of her thighs was covered in goosebumps, and she ran her palm along her leg, sighing in pleasure. “I’ve never allowed my mind to wander too far,” she said softly and low, as if revealing a secret. “Never touched myself, imagining you,” her tone was becoming more sultry with every word. She heard Rio’s breath hitch. “I didn’t want to cross that boundary until I was sure this is what you wanted, too.”</p><p>“I’ve never wanted anyone the way I want you,” Rio rasped. Her voice wasn’t steady as usual, and her tone was not as confident. She sounded breathless and a little broken, and Agatha felt arousal pooling in her lower belly, sending shockwaves along her torso. "So, definitely not asexual—was just waiting for you." Agatha's heart fluttered in her chest. She despised clichés, yet <em>this</em> somehow felt different.</p><p>“All I want,” Agatha’s tone was thick with desire now, and she didn’t care how desperate she sounded, “is for you to run your hands all over me.” She breathed in sharply, sliding one hand inside her robe, which had already fallen half-open. “But you’re always so damn respectful.” Her palm brushed over her breast, and she moaned softly, arching into the touch, her nails leaving half-moon creases on her thigh. “You think you’re so subtle, but I can see your eyes on my chest every time I have the first buttons undone on my shirt.” She glided her hand up her body and tugged at the knot of the robe, undoing it unhurriedly, while her other hand kept massaging her breast. “And I just want your hands on my boobs.” She had both her hands full now. “I want you to feel how fast my nipples go hard between your fingers,” she moaned deep and long, pinching and rolling her nipples now, and heard an answering moan on the other end of the line. It was muffled, barely audible, as if Rio was covering her mouth.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out, her fingers tugging and pulling. “Let me hear you, baby.” Another hard tug at a very right angle made her wheeze. “If I can’t have you here, I need to at least hear you. Don’t deprive me of that.” Agatha was not sure how she could still form coherent sentences, as her head swam through thick arousal, her body shaking at the sharp sensations of finally being touched. The thought of Rio, losing her mind, losing her composure, kept her going. And when she heard her moan—clear, and low, and so beautiful, she felt a fresh bolt of arousal strike through her, and she had to clench her thighs together, gasping.</p><p>“I’ve never been so wet for anyone, and you haven’t even touched me,” she panted. Her hand snaked down her body, leaving a fresh trail of goosebumps in its wake. She was pleasantly lightheaded and was bursting with anticipation. The first swipe of her fingers confirmed it—she was completely soaked. “Do you want to hear how wet I am for you, Rio?” she half-moaned, half-purred, already pulling out one of her earbuds with trembling fingers.</p><p>She heard Rio choke on air before she finally cracked, “Yes.” Her voice was hoarse and broken.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need more encouragement. She placed her hand on the crease of her thigh, positioning the mic as close to her center as she could manage, and her fingers slid through the slick heat again, slow and deliberate. She wasn’t sure how well the earpiece microphone was transmitting the sound, but judging by Rio’s heavy breaths and tiny whimpering exhales, it seemed to be doing the job just fine. She ran her fingers through her heat several times, gathering as much arousal as possible, spread herself with two fingers, and circled her clit. The first touch hit like a lightning strike. Her body arched clean off the headboard with a desperate scream. “Fuck,” she rasped, voice already unraveling, “so hard and sesitive for you, baby.” Rio was breathing like she was the one being touched. Like she could <em> feel </em> it. “I want you deep inside me,” Agatha groaned, shifting lower on the bed, spine curving as her thighs fell open. Her hand moved in practiced rhythm now, fingers working between slick and swollen skin. “I want you so bad, but I can’t—” she gasped. “I need to come now.” She moaned, “Baby… I…”</p><p>Her fingers froze mid-swipe as the voice—low, breathless, wrecked—came through the line, “Come for me, Agatha.” She pressed her fingers to her clit one final time, and the world splintered. Her body locked tight, then shook apart—legs trembling, muscles spasming, lips parted in a soundless cry. She came hard, clenching around nothing, breath shuddering out of her like she’d been punched from the inside.</p><p>Agatha lay there, boneless, catching her breath. Her fingers were still sticky, trembling slightly where they rested against her thigh. The line hadn’t gone quiet—Rio was still there. Still breathing like she was right on the edge, undone by nothing but Agatha’s voice and the echo of her pleasure. “Baby…” Agatha whispered, voice wrecked, lips barely moving. She lifted her earbud and placed it back into her ear, letting her body sink deeper into the mattress. “Are you touching yourself?”</p><p>There was a long silence—just the faintest shudder of breath. “No,” Rio whispered then, almost like a confession. </p><p>Agatha hummed, slow and low. Her eyes fluttered closed as she spoke, her voice turning velvety again, drenched in post-release warmth. “You’ve been so good for me,” she murmured. “Listening like that. Breathing like that. You stayed so quiet even when I knew you were aching.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio admitted. Her voice cracked around the edges. “You sounded so divine. I… I could hear how wet you were.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, pleased, drunk on it. “And you liked it, didn’t you?” She rolled onto her side, tucking a hand beneath her cheek. “I bet you’re soaked too. Aren’t you, baby?” A soft whimper confirmed it. Agatha’s tone turned coaxing, laced with power and affection. “Touch yourself, Rio.”</p><p>She heard a broken inhale. “I…” Rio was struggling with words.</p><p>“I’m here, baby,” Agatha’s voice turned molten. “Take off your pants for me. Right now.” She waited, listening—there was a shuffle of clothing, a tiny rustle, and then a breath that hitched so hard it made her stomach twist.</p><p>“Now put your hand on yourself. Just press down… feel how warm and swollen you are,” she said softly, and felt the air shift between them. </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whined.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” her tone was gentle, reverent, and teasing all at once. “Touch yourself slowly. Let me hear it.” Rio’s breath hitched again, then she heard the tiniest sound—slick, tentative. Someone gasped—Agatha wasn’t sure who. “There you go,” she cooed, her own thighs twitching sympathetically. She was hot all over again as if she hadn’t just come. “You’ve been waiting so patiently. I want to hear every little sound you make. Don’t hold back,” she encouraged breathlessly.</p><p>“I—fuck—”</p><p>“Circles,” Agatha whispered. “Soft, then harder. Picture me straddling you, soaked and desperate, but ignoring my needs to touch you. Picture me running my fingertips through your folds, gathering all that wetness you left me,” she purred, her tone sultry and daring.</p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio whined, “I’m so close already…”</p><p>“Then come for me,” she said, voice suddenly sharp with command. “Now.”</p><p>A strangled cry cracked through the line—low and deep and desperately beautiful. Rio’s breath shattered into fragments, jagged gasps mingling with tiny sobs as she unraveled, her pleasure bleeding through the phone line. Agatha shut her eyes and listened, heart pounding, something feral and tender twisting inside her. Every sound felt sacred.</p><p>When Rio’s breath finally started coming back to normal, there was only silence. It wasn’t uncomfortable or awkward. It felt almost timid and delicate, and Agatha yearned to simply hold her. “You okay?” she asked, gently now. The same question Rio had been asking her each time she was on the edge of falling. Now, she got to ask her that back. Her voice carried something quieter—something careful.</p><p>Rio laughed, breathless, almost dazed. “I think you broke me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled into her pillow. “Mission accomplished,” she teased. Then suddenly the line went dead.</p><p>Rio’s phone had obviously died. But the minutes kept ticking. Five minutes later, Agatha was still staring at the screen, jaw set, arms crossed, one heel bouncing against the bed frame like a metronome of dread—Rio still didn’t call back. Ten minutes later, her certainty began to dissolve, something bitter curling low in her belly. <em> Had she gone too far? </em>Fifteen minutes in, she started rationalizing—maybe Rio had simply needed a few extra minutes. Maybe she was just pacing around her room, trying to calm down. Twenty minutes later, Agatha decided to wait another ten and reach out in case Rio was spiraling and needed someone to pull her out of the fog, as she always had done with Agatha. Agatha could totally do that—would do that—guide Rio out. Twenty-seven minutes later, her phone finally lit up. Agatha picked up on the first ring, but before she could even say hey, Rio’s voice cut through, urgent, frantic, and a little high-pitched,” My phone died.”</p><p>“And it took you twenty-seven minutes to plug it in?” Agatha’s tone was half-annoyed, half-judging, but there was no real heat behind it. She was worried about Rio, and now that they were talking again, that was all that mattered. Rio was alright, and they were going to be okay.</p><p>Rio’s voice cracked as he spoke again, “Agatha… I’m at your door.” She appeared breathless, as though she had dashed up the entire flight of stairs to her penthouse.</p><p>
<em> Oh? </em>
</p><p>Agatha felt her pulse start hammering in her ears. “You have the key,” she murmured, trying to sound unaffected, coy.</p><p>“I wanted to do everything right,” Rio half-whined, half-sighed. Agatha heard the shuffling, and then the lock turned, and the door opened and closed.</p><p>“You are doing everything right,” she said simply; her throat tightened. It was true. Rio had been absolutely amazing—she was everything Agatha dreamed of, and everything she needed.</p><p>“I mean…” Rio trailed, and Agatha could hear soft, barely audible footsteps padding quietly down the hall. “I wanted to do everything in the right order—take you on a date, be gentle with you, woo you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, “You are already doing it every day.” She heard the footsteps closing in now. “I don’t want you to follow the order from Hallmark movies and romances that are pushed down our throats as the only right way. I want your order.” She heard the footsteps come to a stop, and Rio grew very quiet in her ears. “Baby,” she purred. “Open that damn door and come in, or help me god—“</p><p>The door slowly opened, revealing a wide-eyed, panting Rio. She was wearing sweatpants that hung low on her hips and a faded tee-shirt that was inside out and backward, as if she had thrown it on in a frenzied rush without looking before dashing out of her house. Her hair was rumpled, curls half-tamed by nothing but desperation, and blush was covering the tips of her ears, her cheeks, her neck, and collarbones. She looked wrecked and unhinged, and absolutely gorgeous, and Agatha wanted to grab her in a tight hug, press into her as hard as the laws of physics would allow, and never let go. Agatha didn’t think—just ended the call, removed the earbuds, and tossed them aside. They rolled off the bed and thumped onto the carpet with a dull thud. “Come here,” she whispered, never breaking eye contact. Rio swallowed hard, pocketed her phone, and moved toward the bed as if under a spell.</p><p>Agatha reached for her wrist, grabbing it gently and tugging Rio close. She let Agatha sit her on the bed, pressing her back to the headboard. She let Agatha straddle her lap, her thighs going tense beneath as she settled over her. <em>So what</em> if that was Agatha's favourite way to sit with Rio? <em>Sue her. </em>She needed this closeness. Needed to breathe her in. She ran her fingers down the curve of Rio’s cheek, then along her jaw, like she was mapping something sacred. “I love how gentle and attentive you are,” she murmured. “But, I don’t need you to be gentle all the time.” Once she made contact with Rio’s neck, she wrapped her hand around her throat and squeezed. Rio gasped. Agatha was watching her very carefully, hoping not to get a negative response. Rio swallowed hard against her palm but said nothing. Agatha tightened her grip then, and growled, “Don’t you ever dare resorting to that pre-approved Hallmark bullshit, do you understand?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened. “Yes,” she croaked, her voice already hoarse. The sound of it—wrecked, obedient, desperate—ripped through Agatha like lightning.</p><p>She felt a sly smile tugging at her lips. She adjusted her hand, never easing the grip, pressing harder on the sides of Rio’s neck now, and feeling her wind pipes vibrate with the shallow gulps of air she was trying to drag in. But she was sitting still beneath her. Just watching Agatha take full control. It felt thrilling. Agatha was getting drunk on that power. She leaned in and brushed her lips over Rio’s. “Good boy,” she murmured into her mouth, and the sound Rio made in response wasn’t a whimper, wasn’t a groan, wasn’t quite a moan—whatever it was, it shook straight through Agatha, and completely undid her. <em> God </em>, she wanted to eat this woman alive.</p><p>​​Agatha could feel the tremble in Rio’s throat now—not fear, not protest, but submission so complete it made something wicked and desperate coil low in her belly. She held her there, fingers pressing firm and decisive, eyes locked on Rio’s as they began to get bloodshot, dark lashes fluttering like wings about to fold. Her grip tightened ever so slightly—just a little more, just to the edge—and she watched Rio go quiet and still beneath her, chest rising with sharp, narrow effort. Her hand reached Agatha’s wrist, but she didn’t stop her or say anything; she just held on. Her grip wasn’t strong to begin with, but with every passing second, it grew weaker and weaker. Rio’s eyes began to roll, her lips parted, but no sound escaped. Only when Agatha felt her body begin to waver beneath her did she finally release her grip, yet kept her palm in place, wrapped protectively now. The air rushed in with a gasp, Rio’s throat convulsing under her hand as she swallowed breath after breath, and Agatha watched it all unfold like a sorceress intoxicated by the spell she’d just cast.</p><p>“I need you to understand something,” Agatha hissed, breath heavy, her fingers twitching around Rio’s neck. “The way you are—how you move through this world like it wasn’t made for you, how you don’t follow any script, any rulebook, any fucking societal cue—” She leaned in, nearly nose to nose now, her voice low and a little cruel, just the way she knew Rio liked it. “That is exactly what I have been searching for. My whole life.” Rio blinked, still dazed, lips parted and slick from panting, eyes unfocused—but still trying to look straight at her. Still there. Still hers. Agatha dragged her thumb over the pulse in Rio’s throat. “You’re not intimidated by me,” she said. “You’re not trying to make me change, or shame me, or pretend to understand me while never even grasping it. You—” she nipped at the skin of her jaw possessively, “—you’re <em> into </em> this. You’re into me like this. Aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed in a soft nod. Agatha’s voice turned sharp again, fierce. “Say it,” she growled, biting into the juncture of her jaw and neck.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio rasped. “I want all the versions of you,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I want this one, too. Especially, this one.”</p><p>It hit Agatha like a rush of blood to the head. No one had ever said that to her—not Wanda, not anyone. They all wanted to dim her, domesticate her, wrap her up in softness and shame and tell her that her desire was a wound to be healed, not a hunger to be fed. But Rio—Rio was giving her the reins and begging her to pull harder. And it was unraveling Agatha’s composure thread by thread. She released Rio fully then, hands trembling faintly as they pulled back. And for a moment, neither of them moved, air charged between them like a snapped wire still spitting sparks.</p><p>Then Rio surged. It was sudden, a quiet storm—Agatha blinked and she was on her back, pressed into the mattress, her own breath caught in her chest as Rio hovered over her like a question already answered. “You’re so perfect,” Rio whispered, voice still hoarse but filled with reverence, pressing kisses along Agatha’s jaw, her throat, her collarbone, anywhere she could reach. “The way you are—it fits into all the places I didn’t even know were missing something.” Agatha gasped as teeth grazed her shoulder, her hips jolting upward on instinct. Her whole body felt too sensitive, too raw, her skin singing in the aftermath of control surrendered and reclaimed. Rio didn’t stop. She kissed her like she was parched and Agatha was water. Her mouth moved lower, worshipful and hungry, her hands pinning Agatha gently but with weight, grounding her even as her kisses set her spinning again. The desperation in her touch, the softness of her lips—it was undoing Agatha all over again. She was embarrassingly wet again, or was she still wet? Rio hadn’t even touched her yet. Just her lips. Just her fingertips. Just her voice. Just <em> this </em>—this balance in their dynamics. This gain and surrender of control. This need for one another was deliciously maddening. </p><p>Rio’s hands were hot on her skin—so hot, like she’d conjured fire with her fingertips and pressed it directly into the curve of Agatha’s waist. Every place she touched became sacred, branded, <em> hers </em> . Agatha’s back arched involuntarily. She needed her robe off. <em> Now. </em> It clung to her like a prison, damp and suffocating. But her hands wouldn’t move. She was frozen, hovering at the edge of something irreversible. Rio’s mouth was on her neck now, just below her ear, slow, and gentle, and a little possessive, and Agatha was certain—she was going to fall apart right there, still clothed, just from being touched like this. Like Rio had been waiting her whole life to map her with lips and heat and steady devotion. Like she <em> knew </em> what to do with her., how exactly to touch her.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Because this was it, wasn’t it? The moment. The threshold. When her robe came off, <em> everything </em> would come off. The mystery, the control, the mask of perfection she’d worn like armor. Rio would see her—really see all of her. All the places time had touched. All the places other people had put their marks on. The soft spots she kept hidden. The sharp ones that had protected her. She felt raw under her skin, suddenly. Exposed without even being bare. Rio’s hands moved over her skin like they had all the time in the world. As if she wasn’t waiting for permission, but already had it, and now was savoring this power. <em> God </em> , Agatha wanted her. Wanted to be touched. Wanted to be <em> known </em>. But still a small part of her twisted with panic—what if Rio saw and changed her mind? What if this moment, this shimmering impossible moment, collapsed under the weight of reality? But Rio’s voice was low in her ear now, murmuring some praise she couldn’t quite catch, and her hands were tugging at the knot of Agatha’s robe. Agatha sighed, closed her eyes, and let go. She let it happen. That was it, Rio was about to undress her and—</p><p>“Agatha,” that gentle voice cut through the spiral as it usually did. “Look at me?” She did. Rio’s eyes were wild and wide, but she was holding it together. For her. “I’m crazy about you,” she whispered, fingertips brushing the sharp angle of Agatha’s jaw, tracing the edge like it was something sacred. “And I’m dying to put my mouth on you and kiss every inch of your skin until you forget anything that ever hurt. But I didn’t come here just so we could fuck.” Rio saying fuck was definitely doing things to her. “I was so overwhelmed and lost in this new experience that I didn't know what to do.”​​ Rio continued, thumb sweeping over her cheekbone. “I just knew I wanted to hold you. So, may I please hold you? And then we go from there. Slow. We don't have to do anything tonight.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to cry. How could someone <em> this </em> gentle, this devastatingly sincere, exist? How was this woman so perfect? “Could you…” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Just turn off the lights. Just for tonight?”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replied immediately, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. She pressed a soft kiss to her forehead, then started detaching herself from her body gently and slowly. "But before I do, I want to show you something.” Rio slid off of her and stood up beside the bed. She took the hem of her shirt and lifted it up just slightly, exposing her toned abdomen, then turned—first to the side, then front, then the other side. “I only look this cut when I flex, but when I don’t,” she exhaled deeply, letting her stomach relax—her sharp abs were gone immediately. “I get bloated the same as everyone else.”</p><p>She hooked her fingers in the waist of her sweats and tugged, revealing boxer briefs with Star Wars spaceships print. Agatha smiled at that. Of course, Rio had nerdy underwear. “I literally have only one pair of pants in which my ass looks good,” Rio confessed with a crooked grin. “My first-impression pants I usually wear to introduction meetings.” She smirked, knowing fully well Agatha remembered those. </p><p>Agatha laughed, warm and caught off guard. “I’m not going to lie, I couldn’t stop staring at your ass in those pants during our introduction meeting.”</p><p>Rio laughed too, sheepish. “That was intentional. A strategy. I assure you, my ass isn’t magic outside of those pants.” She turned her back to Agatha then and tugged at the legs of her boxers, revealing the skin. “Because underneath those pants, there’s cellulite and stretch marks.” Agatha’s eyes traced every exposed line of her. She was transfixed. “See? That’s why those are my first impression pants,” Rio said gently. “And that’s why most of the time I wear baggy jeans—there is nothing for others to see there.”</p><p>She was still with her back to Agatha when she released the fabric of her boxers and reached under her knees. “Varicose veins. From a life on my feet. Years of double shifts, gardening, and lifting heavy,” she gestured down her legs. She turned back around slowly, meeting Agatha’s gaze, baring more than just skin. Her gaze was open, sincere, vulnerable. Then, without hesitation, she pulled her shirt over her head and tossed it aside. Agatha stopped breathing while her heart set a violent rhythm.</p><p>“And then, there are my breasts,” Rio said, cupping them lightly in both hands. Agatha swallowed. She should be the one touching her right now. “Because my pictorial and lateral muscles are this well-developed, and my percentage of body fat is very low, my breasts just…” she paused as if to find the words, “hang there,” she let them fall, proving her point. “Like hand-washed mittens, drying on the railing,” she chuckled—self-conscious, but brave. “But that’s just how anatomy works—breasts are primarily composed of fatty and fibrous tissue, so when the body fat is low, their shape gets quite peculiar.” Agatha knew Rio was saying very important things, but Agatha also couldn’t help that she was getting incredibly turned on by Rio speaking science. Rio speaking science, standing there in only her boxers. She bit her lip, overwhelmed and aching. “Can do nothing about biology,” Rio carried on. <em> Yeah, no shit </em>. “That's why all female bodybuilders get implants.” She locked her eyes with Agatha then. “Do you want to touch them less because of that—because of how 'unattractive' they appear?” she asked. There was a hesitation—barely perceptible. But Agatha saw it.</p><p>“No,” she said at once, fierce and earnest.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “So, why do you think I won’t want to touch any part of your body then?” she asked softly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, throat tight. Goddamn Rio. Her stupid psychology doctorate. Her stupid way of peeling Agatha open like she was built for it. Her stupid ability to find the perfect words. Their stupid bond… “Come here,” she whispered, reaching for her with a desperation that she didn’t know how to pretend wasn’t there.</p><p>Rio gave her the gentlest smile. “Let me just—” she nodded toward the light switch. </p><p>“Fuck the lights,” Agatha interupted, sharp and urgent. “Come here,” she said more softly now. Rio obeyed instantly, stepping close, slipping back onto the bed and into Agatha’s outstretched arms. “You have a way with words, Dr. Vidal,” Agatha whispered, tugging Rio all the way down and on top of herself, making her giggle in the process of falling. In one fluid motion, she flipped them so now Rio was beneath her, hair spread on the pillow like a halo, eyes wide and wild. “I’m going to touch you now,” Agatha whispered the words Rio had used that day she was sick, and heard her breath catch in her throat.</p><p>She gulped and nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha lowered herself on one elbow, nuzzling Rio's neck, inhaling her. Her left hand reached out and touched her breast, light and gentle, palm just covering the flesh. “I can't believe you called your boobs, mittens,” her tone was amused, but so fond.</p><p>“I was told I’ve got a rather peculiar perception of this world,” Rio murmured, lips curving.</p><p>“Shocking,” Agatha said dryly. She loved this. She loved how they found a way to bare themselves before each other and be vulnerable. How they could talk during these intimate moments. She loved how easy it felt. </p><p>Agatha’s lips skimmed up Rio’s neck until they reached her ear. She kissed her earlobe, then sucked it lightly, feeling the sharp exhale Rio gave in response. “Your boxers are ridiculous, by the way,” she whispered, smiling against her skin. She dragged her mouth across the line of Rio’s cheek, kissed the corner of her mouth, then hovered—just a breath above her lips. “Do you shop in the boys’ section, ages seven to twelve?” she teased, saccharine sweet.</p><p>Rio’s breaths were growing short and ragged, her body twitching with need under Agatha’s weight. “’S not my fault, boys ages seven to twelve have good taste in science fiction,” she managed, before lifting her head and crashing their mouths together in a kiss that burned like a fuse catching fire.</p><p>Agatha met it head-on, parting her lips and letting Rio’s hot tongue in. She closed her teeth around it after a few moments of kissing. Not hard, just enough to pull a surprised gasp from Rio’s throat. “You’re such a nerd,” she laughed softly. It was so freeing to be this comfortable around another person—to be able to talk even minutes shy of fucking. The kind of intimacy that made her <em> feel </em> the fullness of her heart pressing against her ribs like it might crack them open.</p><p>“You’ll have to make your peace with it,” Rio said, maddeningly casual, as her hands trailed soft, slow patterns across Agatha’s back. She dipped her head and began kissing down her neck, open-mouthed, tongue warm and unhurried. “You’re stuck with me.”</p><p>“I don’t have a problem with it.” Agatha’s voice sharpened. She caught Rio’s jaw in one firm hand, tilting her head back up—not rough, but commanding. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied her.</p><p>Her eyes widened. “You don’t?” That flicker of doubt in Rio’s voice made Agatha ache. How could someone so brilliant still not see how wanted she was? How deeply adored? She knew that kind of self-doubt. Knew the weight of years spent thinking you were too much, or not enough. She also knew that she would need to be patient with Rio, just as she was being patient with her insecurities. </p><p>“No,” she said, completely honest. “I like how passionate you get about things.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, just a little, but she still looked unconvinced. “It bugs most people,” she said quietly, tired.</p><p>“I’m not most people.” Agatha smiled gently and pressed a kiss to her lips. “I like listening to you gush about what you love. Your whole face lights up.” Rio didn’t respond with words. She just wrapped her fingers around Agatha’s wrist and started caressing it, slowly, like she was grounding herself there. She wasn’t tugging Agatha into her body, wasn’t demanding anything—she was just there, in her orbit, looking into her eyes, decoding her. Agatha sighed contentedly and relaxed her grip on her jaw, cupping her cheek instead. “I need you to know it’s safe to be who you are with me,” she said softly, pressing a kiss to Rio’s mouth. “Please remember that.” Yes, she was very turned on, and yes, she couldn't wait to get her hands on Rio, but this was more important right now. Because before they actually go all the way through, turning the page, and starting a new chapter of their relationship. She needed them to get on that same page first—no misunderstandings, nothing unsaid—total abandon in trust. She didn’t want any part of Rio held back in fear. </p><p>“I…” Rio swallowed, eyes darting for a moment before meeting hers again.</p><p>Agatha traced her cheek with her fingertips. “Go on, baby, tell me,” she murmured.</p><p>“I like knives…” Rio exhaled.</p><p>Agatha blinked, lips twitching. “You <em> are </em> a chef.”</p><p>“No.” Rio flushed. “Like… as foreplay.”</p><p>Agatha laughed then, bright and delighted and just a little stunned by how much she adored her. “That was the first thing Jen told me when I hesitated to try the service,” she said between breathless giggles. “That I wasn’t inviting someone with a knife fetish into my home.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t laughing. She was pulling back, shoulders tensing like she was ready to retreat. “We don’t have to,” she started, voice quiet. “I—”</p><p>Agatha silenced her with a firm, slightly messy kiss that made Rio gasp. When she pulled back, her voice dropped low, right into Rio’s ear. “Don’t you <em> dare </em> ,” she said, barely above a whisper—but sharp enough to slice through the air. And when Rio’s eye finally snapped out of her daze and locked with Agatha’s, she smiled wickedly. She shifted slightly so her thigh slipped between Rio’s legs. Never breaking eye contact, she rocked forward, and Rio’s head rolled back into the pillow, guttural moan tumbling from her lips. “I can think of a few scenarios,” Agatha murmured into her neck, voice like smoke and satin, “where I <em> wouldn’t mind </em> your knife.” And then she sank her teeth into Rio’s throat, sucking until the skin flushed dark—an unmistakable mark.</p><p>Agatha had no idea how she knew—only that she did. Something in the way Rio’s body moved beneath hers, something in the stutter of her breath, in the way her thighs tensed when Agatha’s hips ground down into her. There was a slight hesitation there. Not fear, not unwillingness, just… preference. Agatha felt it like a whisper beneath her skin. So she didn’t push. Instead, she rolled her hips against Rio’s boxer-clad center again, dragging a choked sound from her chest. That was the sound she wanted. She did it again, firmer this time, and was rewarded with a soft curse and the sudden clench of Rio’s hands on her hips. Their mouths met again, hot and messy and breathless. Tongues and teeth. Desperate sighs and low moans swallowed between parted lips. Agatha’s robe kept slipping open, teasing skin and then covering it again. It was maddening.</p><p>She pulled back just enough to growl into Rio’s mouth, “Take my fucking robe off.” She shifted to give her access. “Why is it still on? How did this happen?” It was a bit annoying. Her voice was wrecked. Rio whimpered, hands immediately scrambling under the silk, and Agatha tugged at her boxers in turn, already soaked through. <em> God, </em> she could feel everything. How wet she was, how hot her center pressed against her thigh. It was insane that there was still fabric between them. They tore at each other with shaking hands. Not uncoordinated—just frantic. <em> Needy. </em>And then, finally, bare.</p><p>Agatha had a brief, flickering moment where she <em> might </em> have thought to cover herself, to hide something, anything—but it passed before it could fully form. There was no room for self-consciousness here. Not when Rio was sucking her nipples into her mouth with unrelenting devotion, her hands splayed wide over her ribs, holding her steady. “Oh—fuck,” Agatha gasped, threading her fingers through Rio’s curls, not knowing whether she wanted to push her away or drag her in deeper. “That’s—ungh, that’s perfect. Your mouth is so perfect, baby.” Rio moaned into her chest, the vibration tearing through her like lightning. Her touch was reverent but hungry. Tender but insistent. It was maddening. Agatha reached down, grabbed her wrist, and dragged her hand lower. “I need you to touch me,” she ordered, voice hoarse, trembling. “Now.” And Rio did—sliding her fingers down Agatha’s belly, over the slick heat of her. She gasped when she felt how wet she was, pausing for half a breath as if stunned by it. And then she slipped inside, slow but sure, curling her fingers perfectly, dragging a sob out of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop her own movements. She kept rocking her thigh over Rio’s center, even as she was being filled, even as Rio’s fingers thrust in and out of her, perfectly matching her rhythm—she never lost hers. Their bodies slid together, hot and wet and flushed, all muscle and friction and mouths finding each other over and over. Kisses grew frantic again—open-mouthed, gasping, tongues sliding past teeth, teeth catching lips. Every time Rio moaned, Agatha could <em> feel </em> it within herself. Every time Agatha rasped her name, Rio responded with something deeper—more carnal, more loving. Their rhythm built and built, sweat-slick bodies chasing the high together, never apart. Agatha pressed their foreheads together and stared into Rio’s wide, burning eyes, trying to memorize her face as she was getting closer to the edge of the cliff. That soft flush, the way her lips parted, the hitch in her breath, the <em> unbelievable </em> pressure of her fingers curling just right inside her.</p><p>Agatha broke first. She shattered with a sound that barely resembled her own voice—a raw, unrestrained cry that cracked open mid-scream, dissolving into desperate, broken gasps as her entire body locked around Rio’s hand. Her back arched like she’d been struck by lightning, muscles seizing, breath caught somewhere in the hollow of her throat. It wasn’t just release—it was a blinding, burning collapse that tore through her like a star going nova. Rio followed almost immediately, hips stuttering, mouth parted. She came with a strangled moan, her hips jerking, forehead pressing into Agatha’s collarbone as if to ground herself. It was like the force of Agatha’s orgasm had dragged hers out by sheer gravity. Like they’d crossed some invisible threshold together, a loop of pleasure and power that spiraled and fed into itself until they both tipped over the edge—together, their limbs and hearts fused. It felt more like an explosion than a climax. A holy, blinding burst that left them tangled and breathless, shuddering in each other’s arms, every nerve still alight.</p><p>And then it was quiet. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and sex. The sheets were twisted around them, damp and useless. They collapsed into each other, limbs tangled, breath shared, heartbeats racing in sync. Agatha’s voice was raw when she finally spoke, still breathless, “You are <em> shockingly </em> good at this.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, flushed and dazed. “You sound surprised. Do I need to get offended?”</p><p>Agatha snorted a soft laugh and tilted her head to kiss her shoulder. “No. It’s just… you said you didn’t have much experience. And then you go ahead and <em> ruin </em> me.”</p><p>Rio flushed even deeper, if possible, but smiled shyly. She leaned in and kissed Agatha’s cheek, then her jaw, then the corner of her mouth. “I just listen to you,” she said quietly. “And your reactions. And I decipher your needs.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. “Lord have mercy on my worn soul,” she whispered, tucking her face into Rio’s neck. “You’re such a <em> nerd, </em>” she whined.</p><p>And Rio, smug and warm, whispered against her temple, “You’re totally into it.” Agatha just smiled. Burrowed in deeper. She was, and she had no complaints.</p><p>They lay tangled in each other, breath slowing, skin still humming with the echoes of what they’d just shared. Agatha’s weight was a warm blanket over Rio, and her thigh was still pressed between her legs, slick and still trembling. One of Rio’s hands rested on the small of Agatha’s back, tracing patterns only she knew, while the other was buried in her hair. They were a mess of sweat and spit and whispered laughter, sticky and sated, hearts thudding in synchrony. Rio had tucked her nose into Agatha’s hair, inhaling slowly as if she were memorizing her scent—like she hadn’t memorized it already by now. Agatha stroked her ribs with languid fingers, barely there, just enough to keep her grounded. Everything was quiet. <em> Safe </em>.</p><p>She felt as if she was slowly dozing off, her mind overwhelmed with emotions, not even attempting to stay conscious anymore. And then, barely audible above the sound of their mingled breaths, Rio whispered into her scalp, “Por favor ten cuidado con mi corazón pues me estoy enamorando de ti.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, heavy-lidded and half-asleep, her body too wrecked to even turn her head. But the words slid past whatever defenses she had left. No hesitation, no filter. Only truth. “No te preocupes, ya me he enamorado de ti,” she murmured back, as instinctively as breath.</p><p>Rio stilled. Agatha could feel it—the jolt through her chest, the subtle intake of breath, the stunned static like her world had tilted. When she finally lifted her head, Rio’s eyes were wide and unblinking, staring at Agatha like she had just opened the sky. “What?” Agatha chuckled softly, blinking at her. “Somehow it has never come up,” she added with a mock-innocent smile, voice low and raspy from use. “I speak Spanish.”</p><p>And then Rio was kissing her. Hard. The force of it knocked the air from Agatha’s lungs—no finesse, no teasing, just pure, stunned joy and disbelief and reverence, like Rio had no other way to respond except to crash their mouths together and <em> stay there. </em>Agatha melted into it, laughing against her lips, letting Rio pull her in tighter. She reached Rio’s legs, wrapped them around her hips—non-sexual, but anchoring, grounding—and whispered, “Te lo juro, mi vida. I meant it.” She felt Rio smile as she wrapped her in a protective, warm embrace and kissed her cheek. Gentle now.</p><p>Agatha let her eyes flutter shut, her face tucked into the crook of Rio’s neck. She felt her hand at the center of her back, steady and protective, like a promise. They didn’t speak again. They didn’t need to. Love had already been declared—in touches, in laughter, in the collision and liberation of something divine. It had been whispered in another language, and answered without hesitation. Eventually, they drifted off, breath syncing, skin cooling, souls still burning. And for the first time in what felt like forever, Agatha Harkness drifted to sleep not with her system full of loneliness and melatonin, not bracing for a harsh morning full of disappointment, but with her arms full of something she never truly believed she could hold.</p><p>Something steady. Something soft. Someone who knew her every edge and every shadow, and chose to stay anyway.</p>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>That’s all, folks!<br/>From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for sharing this journey with me.</p><p>This story was initially intended to be a oneshot, but it escalated in the most beautiful way. With every new chapter, I kept telling myself that this would be the last one, yet I just couldn’t stop. These Agatha and Rio had so much to share about their lives that eventually I just succumbed and let them. Today, we are stopping at six chapters, but their story is far from finished. I have fallen in love with them in this universe and am not ready to say goodbye just yet. We will certainly visit these two in the future and take a glimpse into their life together.<br/>So, for now, we are saying, see you later.</p><p>— S.💜</p></blockquote>
