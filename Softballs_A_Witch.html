<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>At Westview University, Agatha Harkness reigns supreme as the sharp-tongued catcher and captain of the softball team. With a picture-perfect boyfriend, a demanding double major in energy engineering and physics, and a reputation as the queen bee of campus, she seems to have it all—at least on paper.</p>
<p>But everything shifts with the arrival of Rio Vidal, a brooding transfer student whose blistering fastball and botanical obsession make her both a softball asset and a walking disruption. Majoring in botany and minoring in physics, Rio prefers plants to people and chaos to conformity, especially when it means ruffling Agatha’s perfectly curated life.</p>
<p>What begins as rivalry on the field quickly spirals into something far more tangled beneath the surface.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is never late to class—that is, until today. It’s the first day of classes, and she is going to be late. Her routine was perfect: shower, get dressed, make the bed, have coffee and a granola bar, and walk to her first class.</p><p>Except for her walk to her first class, Physics, which was <em>interrupted</em>. One second, she is walking up the stairs, and the next, she is scrambling to stop her searing hot coffee from flying to the floor and unintentionally spilling it back onto her chest.</p><p>A gasp slips past her lips first, and then a frustrated and angry groan follows, with a death glare at the person who caused the problem. <em>Her white blouse is ruined.</em> Wide, brown, only slightly apologetic eyes stare back at her, but - <em>wow.</em> She's still mad, but maybe not as mad now because this woman is gorgeous and stuns her for a few seconds. The woman is dressed in all black, head to toe, from her Converse sneakers to the black hoodie over her head. Whatever insult she was preparing to spit out slips right out of her mind.</p><p>Then those eyes turn a little more appreciative of her wet blouse, and the insult is on the tip of her tongue once more.</p><p>“Are you <em>blind</em>?” Agatha grits out, quickly pulling the wet material away from her skin and hoping it didn't leak down to her La Perla bra. Anger brews inside her chest at the amused chuckle that meets her ears. The woman smirks, backing away as she continues to look at Agatha with increasingly lustful eyes that make her flush, then <em>shrugged</em>.</p><p>“I'm <em>definitely</em> not blind,” Rio husks with a satisfied smirk when an indignant, flabbergasted huff bursts from the brunette. “<em>Te veo.</em>” The incredulous look of disbelief and anger is kind of a turn-on. She continues her brisk jog up the stairs as expletives mutter at her back like daggers.</p><p>Rio truly hadn't meant to bump into her. She had been rushing to get a good seat at the back of the lecture hall for her first-semester class. Some physics class. Rio would've apologized if she wasn't so quickly distracted by the uppity, well-dressed brunette's chest soaked by coffee. The shirt is white and basically see-through from the liquid. Who can blame her for taking a look?</p><p>Apparently, the brunette can.</p><p>Agatha feels her cheeks turn red from embarrassment, anger, and something else she can't quite put her finger on. The offensive raven-haired woman is out of sight, so her priorities lay with her ruined blouse still soaked in her extra hot double shot salted caramel latte. Scaling the stairs quickly, she finds the closest restroom and strips out of the blouse. She gets more than her fair share of weird looks as women filter in and out of the bathroom to see her half-naked, scrubbing at the coffee stain with water and promptly drying it with the hand dryers.</p><p>A handful of minutes later and a noticeable but slightly less daunting stained blouse, Agatha rushes into the lecture hall. Unfortunately, she was five minutes late and walked right into the professor's introduction. She would've been able to sneak into the back had she not let the door slam behind her, effectively cutting off the professor's sentence with a loud bang.</p><p>“Ah, our first tardy student of the semester.” The professor smiles excitedly. Panic twists in Agatha's gut from that look. Rio smirks from her position in the back left corner of the lecture hall, a good five seats away from other students. The brunette's blouse is still clearly stained from the coffee but no longer wet or see-through, much to Rio’s disappointment. Agatha puts on a brave face, smiles, and walks to the first available seat.</p><p>“Sorry, Professor,” <em>Shit. What’s his name?</em> “Just a little coffee spill. It won't happen again.” She promises. Rio chuckles, short and soft, but the other woman hears it from her spot eight rows down and towards the aisle. Agatha takes her seat and glances over her shoulder, her eyes glaring at the raven-haired woman who dares to laugh at her. Rio smiles wider.</p><p>“It is the first day of classes, the first of the morning even, so I suppose I will be lenient for your sake,” The older man stares at her a little too long, eyes drifting down to her coffee-stained chest, “but know that I won't be so forgiving as the semester continues.” Agatha squirms under his gaze, busing herself with pulling out her laptop instead of thinking about how different the stranger's gaze made her feel. Warm and tingly, not queasy and disgusted like the professor’s does.</p><p>The class continues, and Agatha gives the woman behind her the cold shoulder no matter how hot that heated gaze makes her feel. Rio can't help but let her gaze linger on the other woman, studying as much of her body as she can see. Soft brown curls fall loosely down her back over the undoubtedly expensive white silk blouse. Rio watches her until class ends, and the woman rushes out of the lecture hall without another glance in her direction.</p><p>Agatha's day doesn't get better. It's as if the coffee spilled on her shirt put a sign on her forehead that read ‘inconvenience me’. Inconvenienced she was. Consistently running behind and stuck with stupid lab partners or arrogant professors. To take the edge off, she snaps at a few innocent bystanders but they were in her way. She justifies it and basks in the warm feeling she gets when they stare at her in fear. When practice comes around, she tosses her heavy bag onto the bench between the lockers and angrily rips her shirt off her body.</p><p>“Wow, practice hasn't even started yet and you're already pissed off. Is that a new record?” Jennifer Kale, first baseman for the Westview Witches, asks sarcastically as she leans back into her locker. Agatha shoots her an exhausted glare and changes into her practice clothes, an old set of sliding pants, and a Westview University t-shirt.</p><p>“I had a shit day - don't ask about it.” Agatha bites back, placing her foot on the bench to slip into her cleats and lace them up.</p><p>“Yeah, I wasn't going to,” Jen mutters distractedly while typing on her phone. Agatha rolls her eyes. She likes every woman on the team and even enjoys their company, but that doesn't mean they don't get on each other's nerves. They've had three years to figure out and balance the group dynamic.</p><p>“Wasn't going to what?” Wanda asks as she walks into the locker room, setting her things down in front of her locker across from Agatha. The redhead is the best pitcher she has ever played with, and their connection was immediate. They've been best friends ever since.</p><p>“Ask why Agatha has a stick up her ass.” Jen offers quickly before the catcher can explain. Agatha sends the first baseman the finger, a smug smile, and Jen’s finger fires back in return.</p><p>“Some<em> imbecile</em> spilled coffee on me this morning, didn't even attempt to apologize, then dared to laugh at me when I was late to class because of it,” Agatha groans in frustration when she picks up her stained shirt and tosses it into her open locker, “<em>And</em> my favorite white blouse is fucking ruined.” The locker slams shut. Agatha pants softly at the end of her rant. The outburst had bubbled under her skin all day. It felt good to let it out.</p><p>“Shit,” Jen mutters softly. Wanda's eyes are big and staring at her with concern and shock. Agatha sighed, rolling out her neck as her eyes closed, raising her hands in surrender. She can't change anything now.</p><p>“It's <em>fine.</em> I'm fine.” Agatha opens her eyes and immediately rolls them at Jen’s smug smile staring back at her. Wanda just looks at her with pity and a mouth that snaps shut. She knows from years of friendship that she should stay quiet to avoid the catcher's next outburst being directed at her. Agatha leaves the locker room as the rest of the team meanders in, forcing a smile at the other girls, taking a deep breath of fresh air when she crosses over to the fields.</p><p>“Harkness!” Her eyes pop up to the older man standing in front of the dugout. Herb, their head coach, waves her over. With a soft groan of annoyance, she shifts her catcher’s gear bag higher on her shoulder. She hopes it isn't anything important, she can't handle any more shit today. From his guilty, nervous look, she got her hopes too high.</p><p>“You're about to tell me something I'm not gonna like,” Agatha greets dryly.</p><p>Herb does give her an apologetically stern look, “Eastview State College closed a few weeks ago. Students were transferred all over the country. I think this could be an excellent opportunity-”</p><p>“Get to the part I'm not gonna like.” The catcher bites out quickly to stop the man's rambling.</p><p>“Here I am,” Rio steps around the cinder block dugout, smiling wide when she is greeted by Herb, the head coach and the brunette she ran into this morning. Literally ran into.</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenches, and her glare slides into place easily at the sight of the young woman dressed in black leggings, a T-shirt, and a pair of aviators resting atop her head. One glance from Herb, filled with guilt and maybe fear, makes her glare turn toward the older man. Herb sighs and begins rubbing the tension out of his neck.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that, Harkness. Rio could be a real asset to the team. I always say teamwork makes the dream-” Herb tries to explain. Rio lets her eyes scan down the other woman’s body while she’s distracted, excited to see her in something not so…up tight. Agatha catches the woman, <em>Rio</em>, looking at her from the corner of her eye and decides she doesn't care what Herb thinks.</p><p>“Eat my ass, Coach.” A small chuckle puffs past Rio’s lips with a smirk and a shake of her head. Herb sighs and quickly pulls his captain a few steps away from the newcomer.</p><p>“Don’t give me shit, Agatha. She’s a transfer student. State laws say we give her a spot, any spot. So, set a good example as captain and play nice.” Herb whispers softly and pointedly.</p><p>Agatha glances back toward the young woman who keeps herself busy shamelessly watching her over the top of her aviators. She can’t decide if she wants to throttle the bitch or flush from the attention. One tense nod of acceptance later and Herb nearly jogs away from her.</p><p>Agatha scoffs when Rio smirks and raises her eyebrows in silent expectation, “You’re on a roll,” the brunette walks closer, pinning the woman with her heated gaze as she stops in front of her, “What’s your plan here? Are you trying to ruin the rest of my day? Spilling coffee down my shirt wasn’t enough for you?” She sneers.</p><p>Rio has to bite back the amused smile daring to overtake her mouth, teeth digging into her bottom lip. “Not at all, captain.” Rio quips quickly.</p><p>Somehow, those words make Agatha angrier, and she pushes closer. She realizes too late how tall the other woman is, a few inches above her own, but she stands tall with a chin tilted up in defiance. Rio is amused but hides it well as she pays attention to the brunette in front of her.</p><p>“<em>Exactly</em>,” Agatha whispers pointedly, studying the other woman closely. “I’m your captain, your leader, and I am in charge, so don’t get in my way again.” The unspoken threat is evident in her voice, but she’s unsure what she is threatening. The urge to show her strength and control twists her stomach in knots. What is it about this woman that is driving her so crazy?</p><p>“If you wanna be in control,” Rio pushes her sunglasses onto the top of her head, eyes briefly glance at the captain’s lips, and lets her pause hang in the air thick with tension, “you can be.”</p><p>Agatha feels a flush of heat run through her body and settle between her thighs when dark brown eyes stare at her lips. It makes her panic, and her eyes flicker back and forth between intense brown eyes and anything else before she finally steps back to put some space between them. She spins on her heel and walks back toward the dugout to shake her head and drop her bag, rolling out her shoulders and keeping her distance and eyes off the other woman. <em>What the hell was that?</em></p><p>Wanda walks out with the rest of the team and sends Agatha a questioning look. She doesn’t know how to respond or think right now, so she just shakes her head as the group gathers around the dugout. Herb and Sharon Davis, the assistant coach, approach the team.</p><p>“Everyone, this is Rio Vidal, a transfer student from Eastview. She will be joining the Westview Witches as an alternate until we pin her down in a position.” Herb smiles brightly, really trying to sell the newcomer as anything other than a disruption to the team's status quo.</p><p>“What’s up? I’m Rio.” The raven-haired woman says bluntly. It would be comical if the team weren’t so stunned by the sudden addition. Sharon, always one to break up the monotony, claps her hands and gently touches the young woman’s shoulder to issue her greeting.</p><p>“It is <em>very nice</em> to meet you, Rio. Welcome to the team!” Sharon smiles widely, introducing the rest of the team before directing the women through a few stretches.</p><p>“What’s her deal, Agatha?” Jen whispers, inching her way closer to the brunette for more information, elated to have the chance to gossip. Agatha furrows her brow and fixes the woman with a glare.</p><p>“I-How would I know? Ask her yourself.” Agatha stutters with a bite in her tone. Jen screws up her face in disappointment and leans back over to Alice, the second baseman.</p><p>“Should I be afraid of her or do I want her number?” Jen whispers not so quietly. Agatha rolls her eyes as Wanda chuckles. Blue eyes glance across the group to find brown eyes watching her. It bristles her all over again.</p><p>“Keep it in your pants, Kale.” Agatha hisses under her breath. Jen sighs heavily and meets her captain’s glare with one of her own.</p><p>Rio smirked, glancing at the other woman Agatha couldn’t stop glaring at before continuing the stretches. Like anyone, Rio has her strengths, which she knows well. She is a pitcher through and through. But coming onto a team where she probably isn’t wanted, gunning for a position already taken, doesn’t work in her favor. Fielding isn’t her strong suit, but she does well, earning more than enough encouragement from the bubbly assistant coach.</p><p>Batting goes better. Even if hitting off Wanda is complex, being so close to the blue-eyed catcher is a win, even more so when Agatha tries so hard not to look up at her. She steps into the batter's box, squaring her shoulders and digging her toe into the dirt.</p><p>“What’s your coffee order, <em>Agnes</em>?” Rio whispers teasingly as the brunette settles back behind the plate. She knows her name is Agatha but she wants to see how far she can push. Agatha hesitates, brow furrowing in confusion until she realizes the tactics the newcomer intends to use. She’s being baited for a reaction, a slip-up, and she won’t take it. Those are the most annoying kind of batters, the talkers. She should've known. Agatha takes a breath, ignoring how close the other woman is, and calls her pitcher on the mound for a fastball. Rio groans softly when Herb calls a strike over her shoulder but squares back up.</p><p>“I’m guessing,” Rio tips the ball on the next hit, “vanilla soy latte.” Agatha scoffs and shakes her head, mentally berating herself for reacting. She knows better.</p><p>“Nah, you’re right. That’s not it. Maybe…” Rio trails off as Wanda takes a second longer to wind up on the pitching mound. Agatha hates how she is hanging off every word. “Salted caramel oat milk latte?” Rio smirks, having guessed the brunette’s drink order based on nothing but her personality. The brunette doesn’t know what to say. She’s just staring at the raven-haired woman in awe.</p><p>Rio swings and cracks the ball straight down the third base line. Agatha mutters a curse and watches her run the first baseline with a speed only Alice would be able to come close to. The next batter steps up, and Rio gets closer to home base with each hit. Soon, she is on third base, whispering God knows what to Lilia Calderu, the third baseman, but staring down Agatha behind home plate. All bases are loaded.</p><p>The batter smashes a hit to the outfield, and Rio jets off the bag, heading straight for home base. Straight for Agatha. One runner is tagged out at second, and the ball comes flying to home base. Agatha steps into the baseline when the ball hits her glove, but the younger woman is faster. When she drops her glove to tag her out, the player slides right between her legs into home base. Rio’s heels touch base before the catcher can make the extra reach to tag her out.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw twitches, and her eyes narrow on the dark-haired woman lying in the dirt between her legs, smirking up at her proudly. She forces herself to take a step back. Avoiding the rational side of her brain that asks why watching Rio between her legs pisses her off and excites her. She decides it is just because the rookie was able to score on her.</p><p>Rio picks herself up and dusts off her ass with a cheeky wink aimed at the brunette. Agatha glares back, which means Wanda does too. She’s unsure why the new girl annoys her best friend. Rio seems nice enough, maybe a little weird and mysterious, but nothing extreme. Wanda’s sure she’ll hear about it later. For now, she’s annoyed when Agatha is.</p><p>“So, when does Wanda practice her swing Coach?” Rio questions softly, sipping from her water as they watch the redhead strike out one of her teammates.</p><p>“Uh, Monica Rambeau is our best relief pitcher. She can manage a decent pitch in a pinch but doesn’t get much time on the mound. Only when Wanda needs a break.” Herb nods towards the shortstop, Monica, who dives for a grounder and launches it to first base for an out.</p><p>“I’d like to try it if you don’t mind - let Wanda get a few hits in.” Rio offers casually, raising her eyebrow at the man who seems intrigued by the suggestion. A slight shrug later, Herb calls Wanda off the mound to meet at home base.</p><p>“Wanna take a few shots, Maximoff?” The redhead tilts her head in confusion and glances over her shoulder at Monica. Agatha glances at Rio, who is stretching her arm out at the sidelines, glove in hand.</p><p>“Is Monica warmed up?” Wanda questions curiously.</p><p>“Rio wants to pitch,” Agatha mutters quickly, cluing her friend in. Wanda’s eyes snap to the newcomer, a frown curls her lips, and anger flashes in her eyes. Agatha isn't surprised. Wanda is friendly and polite until someone pisses her off then she gets <em>angry</em>. Her nickname, The Scarlet Witch, isn't just for her pitching skills. Wanda could tear off someone's head if she were angry enough.</p><p>“Oh, sure,” Wanda responds tightly, forcing a practiced smile and handing the ball to Herb. Agatha catches her pitcher’s wrist as the coach walks away, connecting their eyes.</p><p>“Give her hell.” The catcher smirks mischievously when she sees something dark flashing in Wanda’s eyes. Even so, the redhead holds up appearances by waving off her request. Agatha pulls on her mask and waits for Rio to take her stance on the mound before dropping into a squat behind home plate.</p><p>Rio nods dutifully to Herb’s advice, tucking it away for later before dialing into her routine. Hazel eyes meet azure. A few seconds pass with the tension and anticipation of the first pitch settling over them. <em>Breathe. Focus. Pitch</em>. Rio winds her arm around and snaps her wrist with the ball's release, her fast pitch slicing through the air to land with a smack in the catcher’s mitt. Agatha’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p><em>Rio Vidal can fucking pitch.</em></p><p>And that was a warm-up pitch. Her hand tingled with the impact of the pitch. Her eyes glanced at Wanda, who was frozen mid-swing, jaw dropped, eyes flashing with shock and anger. A few grumbles from the field brought Agatha out of her frozen state, and she stood up to return the ball to the pitcher.</p><p>Rio is surprisingly humble, taking the ball and settling in for another pitch. Herb stands beside the pitcher’s mound. His eyes lit up like he found the fountain of youth. Two more pitches and the heat of the rookie’s arm hasn’t dwindled. The catcher is starting to crave the tingling in her palm. The connection between them unfurls with ease and electricity. A partnership pulled out of thin air that just works. It excites and worries Agatha to no end.</p><p>“Let’s see how you do with a batter - Wanda.” Herb motions to the redhead, urging her to enter the batter’s box. Agatha offers her friend a supportive nod, but Wanda isn’t Wanda anymore. The Scarlet Witch is at bat, and she’s begging for a fight.</p><p>Rio recognizes the other pitcher’s anger and determination from the pitcher’s mound and lets a slight smirk cross her lips. Wanda feels threatened, and she should. Rio is <em>good</em>, and she knows it. Now, so does the rest of the team.</p><p>The first pitch flies past Wanda in the blink of an eye. No one says it, but they all know it was a strike. Wanda bristles and hacks at the next pitch, which is just as perfect as the first, but her anger makes her chop too high. A groan works from her chest. Agatha sees her best friend unraveling with rage and tries to reign her in.</p><p>“Take a second-” Agatha begins, only to be cut off.</p><p>“I got it.” Wanda snaps with a glare, bringing the bat up to swing again. Agatha sighs and shakes her head. If she wants the challenge, she can have it. A part of her hopes the newcomer strikes her out. Rio has to stop the chuckle from bubbling up from her chest at the redheads' outburst. Then she notices Agatha’s blue eyes have shifted with annoyance toward the batter, which bothers her.</p><p>So, <em>maybe</em>, she pauses extra long and cuts her pitch a little too far inside, but it still qualifies as a strike, just to piss the woman off. Just because those blue eyes look so annoyed at someone who isn't Rio.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wanda and Agatha see it for what it is: a shot at the batter. The redhead tosses her bat down and pulls off her helmet. Glaring and huffing with anger aimed at the pitcher’s mound. Rio just smiles because getting under someone's skin genuinely delights her. Agatha and Herb spot the potential conflict when the bat hits the dirt. Herb quickly calls for the end of practice and Agatha walks the flaming redhead away from the taunting pitcher, hands on her sides to lead her.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha whispers calmly, watching the Scarlet Witch actively struggle with her rage and calculating how to handle it. Rio watches them closely, specifically how strong hands land on Wanda's sides, and wonders if the pitcher and catcher are closer than she thought.</p><p>“She’s so fucking full of herself. Can you believe how close she got? She could've hit me.” Wanda hisses, seething with anger and vulnerability and a flare for dramatics. Agatha tries not to roll her eyes. The ball was maybe five inches from her body.</p><p>“I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.” The lie singes her tongue. Agatha doesn't know Rio Vidal very well but she has a feeling the woman makes a habit of playing these taunting little games. Nonetheless, the lie calms Wanda's nerves and she takes a deep breath while nodding her head.</p><p>“Right. She's new and she barely had any warm-up. Probably just an accident.” The pitcher reasons, already plastering on a forced smile and walking toward the dugout to collect her things. Agatha catches Rio’s eyes watching her and feels her stomach do somersaults.</p><p>There is <em>something</em> between them now. She has never had an understanding - a familiarity like this with anyone, not even Wanda. It's like Rio can see through her walls and into her mind without even trying - without <em>asking</em>. Agatha swallows the vulnerability climbing up her throat and removes her catcher's gear. That is a problem for another time. Right now, she needs to take a shower.</p><p>The locker room bursts with loud jokes, terrible singing, and slamming lockers. It puts Agatha on edge and makes her wonder how much time she can save by returning to her apartment to shower instead.</p><p>“Are there assigned lockers?” Agatha jumps slightly at Rio’s sudden appearance and glares at the woman for the jump scare. Rio doesn't seem to care, leaning heavily into the locker beside the catcher's and waiting patiently for an answer. Agatha gets a little lost in the sight of sweat sliding down a tanned neck to be soaked up by the material of her black shirt.</p><p>“No - uh, just anything empty. Coach can get you a lock.” Agatha stumbles through her words but ultimately pushes them out in a rush. Rio hums in thought and glances at the locker her shoulder is currently leaning against. A devious plan spawns in her mind.</p><p>“This one taken?” Rio questions curiously, standing straight to pop it open to find an empty locker. Just like she expected - well, <em>hoped</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen in a mixture of panic and bewilderment, “You can't-”</p><p>“You said ‘anything empty’. It looks pretty empty to me.” Rio challenges swiftly, raising an eyebrow with an anticipatory glint in her eyes. She wants a fight. She likes to fight.</p><p>Agatha can't believe the rookie is trying to take the locker next to her own. She won't survive with the raven-haired woman's relentless teasing and unwavering gaze in close quarters like this. Most certainly not when she's half-naked. Agatha can feel a few of their teammates watching them. Wanda is specifically curious to see if their captain will fight back. Not wanting to play into Rio’s game or encouraging the other members to make the newcomer feel unwelcome. She is at a standstill.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow to prompt a response.</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw. “<em>Fine</em>.” She grits out through her teeth. The pitcher swiftly kicks off her cleats and tosses them into the locker. The brunette sits on the bench and raises her foot to start untying the laces of her cleats. She is halfway through the first knot when she sees bare skin.</p><p>Rio pulls off her T-shirt first and tosses it into her bag. She works hard to get her body in shape, so why hide it? She's not the only woman currently half naked, just the only new member of the team, so all eyes are on her—including Agatha’s.</p><p>Black leggings quickly follow the t-shirt, and Agatha feels like her heart might beat out of her chest. <em>What is wrong with her?</em> She has seen fully naked women before. And yet here she is, nearly having a heart attack at the sight of Rio half-naked. Overwhelmed, annoyed, frustrated, turned- are those <em>tattoos</em>? Her eyes somehow widened further.</p><p>Vines and flowers etched in black ink flow from the young woman's left thigh, around her hips and waist, then up her ribs to disappear beneath her black sports bra. Agatha swallows roughly as her eyes helplessly follow each path of the vines and admire the detail in every flower. Not to mention the flawless skin put on display. Her eyes linger on the pitcher's toned thighs and black satin thong.</p><p>Rio spins towards the brunette, knowing that the captain is taking her fill of the exposed skin and tattooed art. Blue eyes quickly jumped up to her own from where they were studying the curve of her ass. Though she's sure, Agatha would strongly defend her honor by simply stating she was admiring the artwork on her body. <em>As if.</em> Rio hasn't felt this much heat from a woman's gaze in a loooong time. She's missed it.</p><p>“Towels?” It’s a simple question that takes Agatha far too long to answer as a flush creeps up her neck. Rio enjoys every second it takes for the woman’s brain to kickstart with a response.</p><p>“Towels, right, uh - on the back shelf,” Agatha mutters, vaguely pointing back towards the showers. Rio smiles gratefully, swiftly, and confidently, making her way down the corridor of lockers, earning wolf whistles and shocked gasps as she goes. A different feeling flares in Agatha’s chest with the reaction from the team, but she chooses to ignore it. Deciding she’s suffered enough cruel and unusual torment for today, Agatha changes into her sneakers and snatches her bag off the bench.</p><p>“Agatha, where are you going?” Wanda asks curiously.</p><p>“My apartment where the water pressure doesn’t suck,” Agatha excuses quickly, happy to escape Rio’s half-naked self. If only the image weren’t burned into her brain.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio can be nice. She's being nice right now, picking up coffee from the local café, The Caffeine Coven, for herself and Agatha. One hot salted caramel oat milk latte for the brunette and an iced Americano for herself.</p><p>Agatha has made a point of being ten minutes early ever since the first day of class. She sticks with her same seat which happens to pay off because the professor always looks at her a few steps through the door. His eyes jump down her body just hoping coffee is spilled on her again. Agatha forces a smile until he looks away then grimaces with an eye roll. Suddenly a coffee cup is placed in front of her and she looks up to see Rio watching her with a cocky smirk, sunglasses on top of her head and hair pulled back into a messy bun.</p><p>“What's this?” Agatha sighs, eyes glancing as quickly as possible down Rio’s attire of dark jeans and worn-out sweatshirt. She really shouldn't look so good in such a basic, worn down outfit. Rio hums softly in feigned thought and tosses her bag onto the floor. She can't help but briefly appreciate Agatha’s jeans and button down shirt, not stained with coffee.</p><p>“Coffee.” Rio plops into the seat beside the catcher, pulling out her laptop to prepare for class. The brunette preens and bristles at the dark-haired woman's close proximity. Of course, Rio is going to take the seat next to her.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, “No shit. Why?”</p><p>Rio sips from her coffee, the straw bit between her teeth in a smile. She doesn't want Agatha to think she is apologizing for spilling her coffee even if that's what her intentions are. Somehow that feels like losing and Rio doesn't lose.</p><p>“A…peace offering.” Rio explains confidently and the other woman raises an eyebrow in surprise. She notices the pitcher shifting in her seat and the way her eyes refuse to meet her own. Which is odd because this woman loves to stare her down any time of the day for any reason whatsoever.</p><p>“A peace offering,” Agatha leans in a little closer with a knowing smirk, “or an <em>apology</em>?” She draws teasingly.</p><p>“<em>Me</em> apologizing to <em>you</em>? Whatever for?” Rio asks innocently, refusing to admit the coffee is in fact an apology for spilling the brunette's coffee. Agatha’s lips part, ready to fire back with her growing frustration. She doesn't get a chance to speak before the professor begins the lecture. Rio smiles and Agatha scowls. That seems to be their new normal.</p><p>Agatha reluctantly sips from her coffee, hating that it is her exact order and it tastes better than usual. She clicks through the monotonous slideshow presentation, attempting to take notes instead of being distracted by the other woman's smokey perfume. She glances at Rio's iced coffee and wonders what she ordered. She wasn't going to ask right then, maybe later if she worked up to it. Rio sees her staring at the cup and leans over to whisper in her ear, her arm reaches out to rest behind the brunette's shoulders. The catcher sends a warning look towards the arm behind her back. Not that it turns Rio cautious in the slightest.</p><p>“It's an Americano. Four shots.” Rio provides knowingly. Not pulling away quite yet when she notices the brunette trying to look like she wasn't staring and because the smell of her sweet, spiced perfume makes Rio want to bury her nose in her scent. Agatha tries to put on a front like she wasn't trying to figure out her coffee order.</p><p>“Did I ask?” The catcher questions, facing forward again but definitely not paying attention because the raven-haired woman hasn't backed away since whispering in her ear. She feels her shoulders burning with the knowledge that Rio’s arm is inches from touching her.</p><p>“But you wanted to know - I could tell you were thinking about it.” Rio jabs back swiftly, leaning back but keeping her arm firmly at the back of the other woman's chair. Agatha scoffs and sends her a glance.</p><p>“You don't know what I'm thinking,” She whispers, trying to write down something the professor is saying just to look like she isn't distracted.</p><p>Rio smiles widely, “Tell me I'm wrong.”</p><p>“You're wrong,” Agatha snaps back quickly, because even though the pitcher wasn't wrong she will be the last person on earth to tell her she is right. She looks over at Rio who chuckles quietly and shakes her head. That pisses her off. Mostly because it's Rio but also because it means she doesn't believe her. “Also, are you a psychopath? That drink order is insane. Four shots-”</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” Agatha’s eyes snap up to the professor who is glaring at her from the front of the lecture hall, “perhaps you would like to teach the class about the laws of thermodynamics?” He begins walking up the stairs, closer and closer with eyes continuously dropping to her chest. Rio's gaze turns heated toward the professor when she notices the not so subtle look he is giving the catcher. Agatha is begging the flush to stay off her face from embarrassment and annoyance.</p><p>“Explain the first law,” the professor demands, smiling knowingly that Agatha wasn't paying attention. Luckily, she likes minoring in Physics a lot more than majoring in energy engineering and the question references to both. Not to mention her family is one of the biggest energy companies on the east coast, Harkness Energy. She sits up straighter in her seat, chin raised in defiance and challenge, meeting his eyes with strength.</p><p>“The first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or destroyed. Also known as the law of energy conservation.” Agatha responds swiftly and calmly, crossing her legs and raising her eyebrows for his response. For a second he doesn't have one, eyes narrowing angrily at being bested before he starts poking holes in her answer.</p><p>“Or…” The older man trails off, searching for an answer. Agatha’s brow furrows in confusion, sure that she didn't answer incorrectly. The older man sighs and shakes his head in disappointment. “Or transferred. I expected better from you, Miss Harkness but you were late to my first class. I’m not sure what I was hoping for.”</p><p>Agatha absolutely fumes with the comment, her professional and calm exterior falling slightly to glare at the older man. Just as her lips part to fire back with a retort her mother would surely have her ass for, the woman beside her speaks up. Rio scoffs and pins the man with her signature stare.</p><p>“Oh, <em>please</em>,” Rio bites back, “that was a perfect answer.” The professor huffs in disbelief and turns his anger onto the dark-haired student.</p><p>“Who are you to-” Rio doesn’t let him finish and Agatha can’t stop herself from staring at the woman defending her.</p><p>“Do you know who her mother is?” Agatha’s eyebrows jump up in surprise, not expecting the other woman to know who her mother is. The professor flounders, eyes jumping back to the brunette as his mouth opens and closes.</p><p>Rio answers for him, “Evanora Harkness, CEO of Harkness Energy. Agatha is the heiress to the highest ranked energy supplier on the East coast.” Agatha feels a little bit of confidence and pride leaking back into her with the pitcher’s effort to defend her. It makes her hot in a way that is incredibly frustrating.</p><p>“Oh…” The professor’s eyes widened as if he were just now putting two and two together. He swallows roughly and forces a smile. Agatha forces herself to look away from the pitcher to give the man a very satisfied look because he looks <em>terrified</em>. As he should. Rio chuckles and leans back in her seat, placing her arm back on the brunette’s chair once again.</p><p>“So, yeah, that was a perfect answer. Don't you think?” The raven-haired woman smirks that smug smirk and Agatha finds herself not hating it when it isn’t pointing at her. The professor clears his throat and refuses to meet either of their eyes.</p><p>“O-Of course, Miss Harkness. Let's get back to the lecture,” the professor is quick to move on. Rio shakes her head at the lack of an apology but refrains from bringing it back up again. Agatha glances at the woman beside her and bites her lip to hold back a smile that tries to push through when she notices Rio's angry frown.</p><p>Towards the end of class the professor makes an announcement of the lab due at the end of the week and requests everyone to pair off. Agatha is already slinging her bag over her shoulder and pointedly walking out of the classroom. The professor wouldn't dare call her out a third time and if he did, there would be hell to pay.</p><p>Rio scrambles to throw her things into her book bag and follows the catcher, coming up to walk beside her. Agatha sighs at the other woman's appearance, hoping she would catch a break and be able to study for her next class with some peace and quiet.</p><p>“Wanna be partners?” Rio questions curiously and receives a skeptical look. “What? Did you have someone else in mind?” She teases quickly, a cocky smirk taking over her lips because she knows damn well Agatha has little to no options to choose from.</p><p>The catcher sighs and sends the woman an exhausted glance but her gut already twists with excited anticipation to be working so closely with the woman. That doesn't mean she can't make her work for it. Agatha stops off to the side of the walkway where hundreds of other students rush to class.</p><p>“Sure, Vidal, I'll be your partner - under one condition.” Agatha smiles mischievously, putting Rio on edge and exciting her. Not one to back down from a challenge, the freshman steps closer.</p><p>“Shoot,” Rio prompts.</p><p>Agatha takes her own half step forward, “Apologize for spilling my coffee.” She smiles wider when the other woman’s already intense stare narrows on her. Rio does not want to apologize, even if she should. Because, much like admitting the coffee this morning was a wordless apology, saying it out loud would be like losing this little game between them. Rio doesn't lose, so she flips it around on the brunette as best she can while still getting what she wants.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio begins slowly, stepping closer and making blue eyes flicker down to the shrinking space between them. The tension between them grows quickly.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Her hand came up to brush back the wave of hair threatening to fall in the eyesight of the catcher, their eyes locked on each other. Agatha thinks she's done, lips part to gloat about how easy it is to apologize when you're not stubborn..</p><p>“For spilling your coffee,” Rio takes another half step forward. Agatha’s breath catches, not expecting the advance, the genuine apology or the hand that brushes back her hair.</p><p>“And staining your shirt.” Rio follows the strands of hair, letting her fingertips ghost down the brunette's slender neck, daring to glance at her chest suggestively, before dropping back to her side. Goosebumps rise in the wake of her fingers and the satisfaction of rendering the other woman momentarily speechless presents itself as a soft smile.</p><p>A fluttering in Agatha's chest keeps her rapt attention on Rio's extraordinary gaze, the people around them fading. She's beginning to wonder if this woman has some sort of superpower, an ability to make her yearn for something she's never wanted before. When the brunette doesn't respond and Rio has the urge to move in closer, she speaks again but a little softer.</p><p>“Do you forgive me?” The pitcher whispers, tilting her head slightly. Agatha finally snaps out of her trance, shaking her head slightly and swallowing roughly. Why is her throat so dry?</p><p>“Meet me at the library, seven o'clock - tenth floor in the back lab rooms.” Agatha mutters, fortifying her gaze toward the raven haired woman to move past the heavy tension. She pushes past the other woman with their shoulders bumping together in her departure. It makes Rio smile triumphantly and watch her walk away.</p><p>The day passes by quickly much to Agatha's displeasure. She obviously hadn't thought her plan all the way through, refusing to give credit to the other woman's tactics of distraction, because all she can think of is being alone with Rio.</p><p>Here she is on the tenth floor of the Stan Lee Memorial Library, tucked into one of the back lab rooms specifically made for physics students, waiting for Rio to arrive. Her pen taps nervously against her physics textbook, chewing on her bottom lip as her eyes flicker towards the stacks of the quiet library outside.</p><p>Agatha berates herself for picking such a secluded spot. This <em>thing</em> she has with Rio isn't really a friendship but more of a game, a competition they are both trying to win. She doesn't really know what <em>winning</em> means or what it would look like but she is determined to find out. The problem is she is always a step behind the infuriatingly smug woman.</p><p>Just like now.</p><p>Agatha's head snaps up at the glass door opening to reveal Rio, smirking because she knows she caught her off guard, and scowls in return.</p><p>“You're late,” Agatha fires off without a thought. Rio chuckles and shuts the door behind her and takes the seat right beside the other woman. The catcher wishes she wouldn't.</p><p>“I'm not late.” Rio doesn't even have to glance at the time to know that. Simply because she's been watching the clock ever since the brunette set a time for their lab work. Agatha glances at the clock on the wall and notes it is one minute past seven. <em>Technically</em>…</p><p>“You are exactly one minute late.” Agatha states matter of fact. Rio smiles widely and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Were you lonely without me?” The dark haired woman husks, opening her laptop and fixing the other woman with a sultry look. Agatha bites back a groan of frustration and stops the roll of her eyes, begging the blush to stay underneath her shirt, and settles for a glare instead.</p><p>“Let’s get this over with.” Agatha hisses, grabbing the lab instructions from her pile of papers and reading them aloud. Rio, while she enjoys teasing the other woman, focuses on the project ahead of them. Botany is her major of choice, loving any and every plant on the good green earth but physics is where things get exciting. Physics is chaos and order rolled together.</p><p>The lab passes by smoothly. Agatha realizes Rio <em>does</em> have the ability to keep her mouth shut and her mind focused - when she wants to, of course. When she does that, it makes Agatha not want to strangle her for smirking suggestively and staring at her with dark eyes, all of which sends her stomach into a mess of butterflies.</p><p>In turn, Rio realizes Agatha isn't just a skilled athlete but she is insanely smart. Rio likes watching her work which is how she got so distracted while completing the last practical portion of their thermodynamics lab.</p><p>“Ow- fuck!” Agatha hisses in pain, jerking her hand away from the hot rod they have positioned on top of the lab table. Rio quickly reaches out to take her wrist, noting the quickly reddened skin, dragging her towards the sink in the corner of the room.</p><p>“Deep breath,” Rio commands quickly, sticking the other woman's hand underneath the cold running water and placing a calming hand at the small of her back. Agatha gasps and winces at the first pass of cold water, nearly jerking out of the other woman's grasp before it tightens, but soon all she can think of is the warmth of the pitcher's hands at the small of her back and wrapped around her wrist. Her eyes drift up from the arm holding her wrist, noticing how close the other woman is and subconsciously leaning into the heat of her body, eyes watching dark brown eyes study her hand with concern.</p><p>Rio turns her gaze towards the brunette when she feels her eyes on her. Blue eyes swirl with intrigue and curiosity. Her thumb moves gently against her lower back, stroking softly to pull her closer.</p><p>Agatha leans further into the touch, her eyes dropping to Rio’s full lips and wondering if they're as soft as they look. She shouldn't be so tempted. She has never kissed a woman before but suddenly the urge is undeniable. She leans in a little more, surprising them both.</p><p>Rio is seconds away from indulging. She feels helpless, wanting to keep her distance and move closer all at once. She shouldn't. She shouldn’t. The hand on the brunette’s back wraps further around her body to grasp her hip and slide her closer. Nothing but a whisper of heated air stands between them now. Each soft breath fills the space with desire and adrenaline.</p><p>An announcement over the PA system pushes them apart.</p><p>“<em>The library will be closing in ten minutes. Please gather your things and make your way to the exits...</em>”</p><p>Agatha quickly pulls out of the other woman's grasp and puts distance between them, panic and confusion flaring in her chest. <em>What the hell was that?</em> Her eyes flicker between the ground and Rio, finding it too difficult to even think about what they <em>almost</em> did. She can't help but blame someone and she sure as hell won't be blaming herself, despite leaning in and looking at her lips first. Agatha glares at the raven-haired woman.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath, watching Agatha roll through emotion after emotion before landing on one - anger. Specifically pointed at Rio. She knows she should've kept her distance but the connection- the pull - towards Agatha isn't something she has felt before. Sue her for thinking about kissing the woman. It's not like the brunette wasn't thinking about it. Agatha is the first to start moving, putting on a show of normalcy even if it's for her own comfort.</p><p>“I'll turn the lab in tonight.” Agatha shuts off the running water and packs up her things.</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>“Don't.” The catcher tosses the dismissive word over her shoulder with a glare, quickly leaving Rio before she does something else incredibly stupid. Rio sighs and shakes her head because she simply doesn't understand why this woman chooses to be so stubborn.</p>

      Chapter 3: Chapter 3: Girls Night Out
  </h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha has a boyfriend...right?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha has a boyfriend.</p><p>Agatha has a boyfriend and she keeps forgetting that she has a boyfriend. It’s terrible, it is. She is a horrible person for forgetting her on-again-off-again boyfriend of three years. Especially since Ralph is the captain of the baseball team, the hottest man on campus, and always being doted on by random freshman girls. Ralph isn’t necessarily forgettable like most men.</p><p>Their relationship is more like a light switch because Agatha just can’t stand his presence <em>all.the.time.</em> She makes an effort, but one slip-up can send her up a wall - cutting him off until she needs an itch scratched, and then Ralph is more than happy to return.</p><p>Except lately, Agatha doesn’t have room for anything else in her mind but school, softball, and Rio <em>fucking</em> Vidal.</p><p>The dark haired rookie is eager. As soon as the coaches knew she could hit and pitch, the competition began. No matter how often Herb and Sharon reminded their first string pitcher that she wouldn't lose her spot, Wanda still felt threatened. Rio wasn't helping with her smug smirks and snide remarks but she never did anything she could get in trouble for. Which made Wanda even angrier and Agatha a full time babysitter for her pitcher.</p><p>Rio enjoys it, teasing Wanda also gets a reaction from the brunette who has begun to fire back at her taunting with an increasing amount of fire in her eyes. And since the two women are both minoring in Physics, the push and pull of their…<em>them</em> extends beyond the field.</p><p>The lab they worked on together was their last, Agatha using the professor's fear of her mother against him to be able to work the rest of the labs by herself. She didn’t need anymore distractions in the form of Rio Vidal. The raven-haired woman is consuming most of Agatha's thoughts as is.</p><p>So, Agatha forgets she has a boyfriend until hot, heavy hands slide onto her hips. She gasps softly, turning her head to glare softly at the tall, blonde, chiseled man behind her, who offers a big goofy smile in apology for startling her. It’s not the seductive smile she wants to see. It’s not the correct weight of hands on her hips.</p><p>Agatha tries not to shiver with disgust when Ralph’s breath, thick with the smell of beer, washes over the back of her neck. Suddenly, their on-again-off-again relationship feels <em>very</em> off. She scans the room, spotting dark eyes locked in on her through the crowd. Dark and mysterious but still so intense with something Agatha assumes, <em>hopes</em>, is jealousy.</p><p>She pushes down that disgust from earlier and leans back into the man’s chest, lifting the basic bitch vodka cranberry, heavy on the vodka, to her lips while keeping their eyes locked over the rim of the cup.</p><p>“What are you drinkin’, babe? I’ll get you another.” Ralph husks into her ear, probably trying to sound seductive and inch his body closer. His hand reaches around her to take her cup before she agrees. It takes everything in her body not to snap at him for it.</p><p>“Vodka cranberry,” Agatha responds over her shoulder, watching Rio’s eyes drop down her body as subtly as possible. It’s not so subtle to her, heat burning low in her belly with that look, but she hopes it is to everyone else.</p><p>She reaches back with her left hand and tilts her chin up, meeting Ralph in a soft kiss that has the catcher’s stomach-turning. Ralph smiles, as happy as a dog with a new bone, at the sudden public display of affection. Agatha forces one back and feigns affection when swiping her lipstick from his mouth.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes at the action and takes a healthy sip of her Jack and Coke. It’s not her regular go-to cocktail, but supplies are pretty limited at house parties, so she makes do. She had been watching the catcher dance, drinking, and talking with Wanda and the other team members at the party for a while. Then a man showed up, and suddenly, taking her eyes off the brunette became much more complicated even when she leaned back into him and offered <em>him</em> her lips.</p><p>Rio distracts herself by looking down at Agatha’s body, appreciating the tight black dress and the large expanse of leg she displays—the red lipstick softened from their kiss and the dolled-up face of makeup bringing the look together. The man, the human version of a golden retriever, leaves the catcher with her cup in what she assumes is a mission for a refill.</p><p>“Hey Jen,” Rio turns toward the first baseman and her crush of the night sitting on a chair. Jen hums noncommittal, flickering her gaze between Rio and the woman in her lap. “Who's the puppy dog following Harkness around?” It’s an innocent question, but Jen is too distracted and buzzed to care even if it wasn't.</p><p>“Oh, that’s Ralph, her boyfriend.” The first baseman chuckles and nods in avid agreement. “He does look like a puppy dog.” Rio smirked, hoping the nickname would stick, then focused on the brunette, who was once again accompanied by the <em>boyfriend</em> and a new drink. It’s not like she’s happy to hear the woman has a boyfriend, but it adds a minor obstacle. Nothing she hasn't gotten around before.</p><p>Rio isn’t sure exactly what this is between them, but she is excited to find out. Ralph leaves at the request of a few of his friends for a beer pong tournament, leaving Agatha alone—time to make her move. The pitcher weaves through the crowd until she appears next to the catcher.</p><p>“What are you drinking, captain?” Rio questions curiously, stepping close with a risky hand at the small of her back. Agatha doesn’t jump like she did with Ralph. The hand on her back is warm and light, not pressing for more contact like she's used to.</p><p>She remembers the night in the lab, similar to how they stand now, the other woman's hands on her satisfies a craving she didn't know she had. Her heart flutters when she sees the familiar dark and mysterious eyes beside her. Wasn’t she watching her from across the room only seconds ago?</p><p>“Vodka cran-” Rio is already grabbing the cup with her face twisted in disgust.</p><p>“Don’t finish that answer - or that drink.” Agatha frowns, but it quickly falls from her lips when a warm hand slides into hers, grounding her as they weave through the crowd and head toward the kitchen. Her palms are sweating, and she hopes the other woman will write it off as the heat from the absurd number of people in the house and not her nerves from the other woman’s close proximity.</p><p>Agatha loves the softness of Rio’s skin but doesn’t get a chance to touch her very often. Not very many excuses for up close contact in softball. <em>Why couldn’t they play soccer or basketball?</em> Agatha commits the feeling of her warm hand to memory. Rio tosses the cup into the sink and reaches for a new one, dropping the catcher’s hand.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha yells over the music, excusing the need for her hand to rest on the pitcher’s jean-clad hip. Rio looks over the sad excuse of a bar, slightly distracted by the hand on her hip, deciding on the drink of choice.</p><p>“Making you a real drink,” Rio answers back, eyes glinting in amusement when Agatha frowns again. Oh, the things she would do to kiss- “a <em>dirty</em> Shirley temple.” So maybe it isn’t a <em>real</em> drink, but it is better than a basic vodka cranberry. Plus, it makes the catcher smile, and Rio likes seeing her smile. Rio has one singular question gnawing at her and the liquor in her system lets it slip.</p><p>“Didn’t know you had a boyfriend.” <em>Smooth Rio</em>. Blunt and tinged with the strain it takes for her not to grimace at the word boyfriend. Agatha is surprised by the question. Her alcohol-flooded system struggles to find the best answer. The best she can come up with is a mix between the truth and a sense of instability in the relationship.</p><p>The last thing she wants to do is make Rio think she’s unavailable. That’s normal for friends to think, Agatha convinces herself. She’s not even sure they are <em>friends</em>, at the very least they're teammates. If she isn’t trying to ignore the very persistent hot and heavy feelings she has for the pitcher she finds herself wanting to throttle her for being so God damn smug and annoying and hot- <em>wait</em>.</p><p>“Ralph, yeah. Three years- off and on,” Agatha admits with a shrug, her eyes looking anywhere but at the raven-haired woman in front of her. That’s not weird. Rio finishes off the cocktail and offers it to the other woman. Agatha takes the drink, looking back into dark eyes to see what she’s thinking. Which is stupid because she knows she won’t be able to tell.<em> Fuck, this drink is really good</em>. Rio just stares at the brunette as she sips from the cocktail.</p><p>“He’s…” Rio trails off, grazing her canine with the tip of her tongue while she tries to find an accurate but nice word for <em>Ralph</em>, “Cute.” Agatha’s eyebrows raise in surprise.</p><p>“Cute?” The catcher questions in slight amusement and curiosity. She wants to know what the other woman truly thinks.</p><p>“<em>Cute</em>,” Rio commits to the word choice simply because it makes Agatha’s eyebrows furrow in that cute sort of way.</p><p>“You do not think Ralph is <em>cute</em>,” Agatha says unconvinced with a scoff. Rio is caught but she’s trying not to let her alcohol influenced tongue twist into the words she wants to describe him. <em>Golden retriever. Pathetic. Frat bro. Not good enough.</em> She doesn’t even know the guy, didn’t even know he existed until five minutes ago. Maybe he’s nice. Maybe he’s good for Agatha. But the catcher just looks so…bored. As if she is playing the part of the softball team captain, straight A student, and boyfriend loving girlfriend when she really wants anything else.</p><p>Rio settles on a nice version of those thoughts, “I’m just surprised you’re with someone like him.” <em>Instead of someone like me</em>, voices silently in her own mind, thankfully. It doesn’t matter because those words create the angry look the pitcher has grown to love and hate all at once.</p><p>“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Agatha’s eyes narrowing. She may as well have picked Ralph out of a catalog for how well they match. It took weeks of consideration for her to pick him. Even her <em>mother</em>, Evanora Harkness, CEO of Harkness Energy and the most judgmental person in the world, can appreciate how well matched they are. Rio looks a little taken aback for half a second before that smug demeanor falls back into place.</p><p>“He's just very obedient.” Rio shrugs, sipping from her cup with a smirk, knowing that she is getting into dangerous territory but unable to stop herself, “I thought you liked a <em>challenge</em>.” She shoves her free hand into her front pocket and watches Agatha's chest light red. She's not sure if it's from embarrassment or anger but she loves it.</p><p>Agatha's lips part, ready to fire back an insult, but suddenly her name is being shouted from across the room so she turns to see Vision, Pietro and Ralph excitedly winning their beer pong game. She catches Wanda's eye, who struggles to keep Vision upright. Rio disappears before Agatha can ask what she means by a <em>challenge</em>.</p><p>Rio distances herself from the brunette, her idiotic mouth almost getting her in trouble once again. She wants Agatha to want her. She doesn’t want to scare her away by pointing out her boyfriend is a cute golden retriever. <em>What was she thinking?</em> So, she sits back, sipping on water and supervising her drunken team mates. Cringing when the brunette chokes down another heavy pour of vodka mixed with cranberry juice.</p><p>Agatha drinks one cup after another, reluctantly reverting back to her pitiful vodka cranberries that have turned to more vodka than cranberry. She searches for Rio throughout the night and finds her watching from one side of the room or another but never coming closer. It drives her crazy. The more she drinks, the worse her frustration gets and the more she stews on the words of the dark haired woman. When she spots dark hair escaping from the party down a hallway and through a door, Agatha follows with a bone to pick.</p><p>Rio takes a step back in surprise when she closes the door and it opens immediately after her. What surprises her even more is Agatha pushing through the doorway and slamming it behind her, flicking the lock into place.</p><p>“Do you have a problem with me?” Agatha hisses and glares at Rio. The other woman chuckles and leans back against the sink to watch her in amusement, gripping the edge of the counter.</p><p>“No, Agatha.” Rio responds calmly, taking a breath to stop her heart from beating so fast. When was the last time they were alone like this? The lab, they got so close to <em>something</em>. Rio’s response really sets the catcher off. The liquor and her frustration mix to create a storm in her mind she can’t control.</p><p>“Because it seems like you do,” Agatha moves in closer with each word, “Did you know that you have a staring problem? I can’t take a step without your eyes on me. Not to mention, you disrespected my boyfriend for no- stop <em>fucking</em> smiling!” The brunette growls angrily, stopping only an inch from the dark haired woman, eyes flaring with fire when she spots that smug smirk.</p><p>Rio can’t help it, she smiles wider, because it is genuinely amusing to hear Agatha call Ralph her boyfriend. Even more so after following Rio to the bathroom just to address that fact which is an interesting choice in Rio's eyes.</p><p>“<em>God!</em>” Agatha grunts, hands clenched into fists and chest rising with labored breaths as she glares daggers at the younger woman, “You are infuriating. I just wanna- I wanna-”</p><p>“You wanna <em>what</em>?” Rio teases, enjoying the way the brunette is so easily riled up when she drinks. Agatha wants to wipe that fucking smirk off of her face.</p><p>Suddenly, she is cupping Rio’s cheeks to crash their lips together. It feels good. How has she never kissed another woman before? Rio is so soft and smooth, despite the crushing force of the kiss. She sighs into Rio’s mouth, melting under the warm hands sliding around her waist to settle on her lower back. Rio tugs her forward and a small moan slips from her lips. Already this is lightyears better than kissing anyone - better than kissing Ralph - <em>fuck</em>.</p><p>Agatha pulls away, her open palm connecting with Rio’s cheek as she pushes back, the smack echoing in her ears. A gasp slips past her lips and her stinging fingers come up to touch her lips in shock. Her eyes are wide and staring at the raven-haired woman as her cheek slowly turns pink.</p><p>Rio blinks a few times, trying to roll with the whiplash of the past few minutes, mentally taking stock. Agatha was yelling at her, Rio smiled, Agatha kissed her, <em>fucking moaned</em> then slapped her.</p><p><em>Agatha just fucking slapped her for kissing her…and liking it.</em></p><p>Rio huffs a soft laugh of surprise and disbelief, a smirk curling her lips. Her eyes drift back up to see the brunette watching her in shock from her own reaction. Lust and concern shining from her blue eyes. She's just glad the other woman isn't actually mad at her.</p><p>Rio’s cheek is lit red with the sting of the slap and the heat running through her body settles between her thighs with an intense ache. She won't be able to just walk away from this if Agatha decides to leave. She will need some sort of outlet for all the desire and anticipation brewing in her chest. Patient and hopeful, she waits and watches.</p><p>Agatha's fingers leave her lips to graze across heated red flesh in concern. An apology is on the tip of her tongue but she can barely process everything that just happened let alone speak. Her eyes drop to Rio’s lips once naked now smudged with her red lipstick and god it looks good on her like this. Only like this, when she has kissed the lipstick into place.</p><p>Next her eyes lift from the red lips and burning cheek to dark brown eyes, expecting the heavily guarded gaze she normally sees, instead finds the most expressive eyes she's ever seen. Lust and hope swirling together in dark brown eyes watching intently for her next move. <em>Rio wants her</em>. Then she sees that fucking smirk again and remembers how the kiss worked wonders to wipe the smirk off her lips. Agatha feels herself moving before she realizes it.</p><p>They're lips meet in a more graceful kiss but the passion isn't lost. Agatha’s hands dropped to the other woman's chest, fisting the material of her black button down to pull her closer. Rio hums softly, pleased to have Agatha's lips back on hers but still skeptical. She's waiting for another knee jerk reaction, another slap or maybe more yelling.</p><p>So, her hands hover an inch away from the brunette's body and she follows her lead in the kiss. That pisses Agatha off because she can feel the other woman holding back. She knows Rio can and would give her more. Rio could give her so much more. The desperate heat between her thighs urges her body closer and closer until Rio feels the counter biting into her ass. Teeth bite into her bottom lip and it takes everything in her not to hiss with the painful pleasure.</p><p><em>Fuck it</em>, Rio thinks, one hand landing on the small of Agatha’s back and the other curling around the back of her neck. Rio stands from her relaxed position against the counter and uses her height advantage and the hand on the back of her neck to take control of the kiss.</p><p>The first kiss may have been a mix of rage and lust, but this second kiss is pliable. As if Agatha has forgotten how to kiss and Rio has to show her exactly how it's done. Teeth clacking, tongues wrestling, soft sighs shared between the miniscule space as they part. It's a stark, chilling difference between any other kiss the brunette has had. She's lost all control. A moan, soft and full of relief, leaks past red lips. Agatha’s hands move down to rest on slim hips as her mouth becomes pliant under the pitcher's passion.</p><p>Rio moves forward, leading them back until the other woman is pressed against the door with a soft thud at the contact. Agatha grunts softly and digs her nails into denim to keep herself steady. Not that she needs to. Rio has her pressed firmly into the door and she <em>loves it</em>. For once in her life she <em>wants</em> to let go. She wants to lose her control. She wants to let Rio have her.</p><p>Agatha just <em>wants</em>.</p><p>Rio is more than happy to pick up the slack. Skillful fingers tease the sensitive skin at the back of her neck before twisting in loose brown locks, tugging just enough to tilt her head where she wants it and produce a gasp from her companion. It works, Agatha’s lips part with a sharp intake of breath and her hands tug the raven-haired woman closer for it.</p><p>Rio swipes her tongue across her plump, kiss bruised bottom lip and smiles at the way the catcher nearly shakes with the moan that leeches from her chest. Agatha hooks her fingers into belt loops to somehow show she wants whatever the other woman will give her. She wants more and she doesn't give a fuck if her next moan rings a little too loudly because Rio is kissing her with <em>tongue</em>. Deep and sensual, nothing compared to the sloppy rushed kisses she shared with Ralph.</p><p>Rio groans softly, feeling her resolve to keep this semi under control slipping, dropping her hand down to grab at the woman’s firm ass and tug. The dress makes things difficult at first but smooth thighs let the material glide up until a tone thigh can slip between them. Agatha whimpers and pulls away from the kiss. Her eyes squeeze shut and her head drops back against the door, her teeth biting into her bottom lip as her hips jump for friction.</p><p>Rio takes the opportunity to explore the expanse of skin in front of her without hesitation. The hand on the catcher's ass easily rocks her forward. A gasp quickly turns into a moan at the fresh heat ripping through Agatha's stomach. Her dress has worked its way up her legs enough for a toned, jean clad thigh to press flush against her covered center. Her nails dig into the woman's back to pull her closer.</p><p>Rio’s fingers pull on the hair intertwined in her grasp to tilt her head back further and reach more skin of the catcher's sensitive neck, careful not to leave marks. Nothing lasting anyway. The harsh panting breaths and moans mix with the deafening sound of blood pumping in her ears. Her teeth nip at the skin just below a strong jaw and a smile stretches across her lips pressing into heated skin when a hitched gasp sounds in her ear.</p><p>Their lips connect again once Agatha feels the other woman smile, groaning slightly in frustration, determined to kiss it away. Tongues battle for dominance between them with a mix of moans and sighs echoing each other. Agatha’s hands find home on a strong hip and wrapped around shoulders. Her hips, guided by Rio’s hand, roll again and she is seconds away from releasing a door rattling moan when the door shakes, but not from her.</p><p>The handle jerks and jiggles with the outside effort trying to open the door, unsuccessfully, resorting to knocking loudly. “Come on, man! I gotta piss!”</p><p>Agatha, unable to back away due to the door at her back, pushes the other body away from her with a yelp of surprise from the interruption. Rio stumbles backward, just barely catching herself on the counter, panting for breath. The catcher blushes heavily when she notices the darkened spot on black jeans, shucking down her dress and wiping her lips of any smudged lipstick around her mouth. She stares at the pitcher, the disheveled button up wrinkled from the brunette's own hands that now shake at her sides. The dark haired woman's lips are swollen from kissing her, so hard like she's not going to get another chance, and are covered in Agatha's smudged red lipstick. Thankfully, the bumbling drunk outside the door gives up and walks away from the occupied bathroom.</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath and shakes her head. She can't be doing this, whatever this is, she is the captain of the softball team and she can't be kissing the pitcher. She can't be kissing Rio. She can't be kissing anyone unless it is her boyfriend, Ralph. She can't because this could tank her entire life plan that has been crafted for her. Most importantly, she can't be kissing Rio because it is <em>Rio</em>. Because Rio is the rookie, she's a teammate, she's obnoxiously arrogant and cocky, she hates her. Agatha wants to hate her. <em>Why is it so difficult to hate her?</em></p><p>“This…This didn't happen.” Agatha whispers softly at first before her voice and eyes harden, the persona of the Wicked Witch of Westview sliding back into place with practiced ease, “Do you understand me?” Her voice is stern as she moves forward.</p><p>Rio shouldn't be surprised. She's not sure what she was expecting but she should've expected this, especially after that slap. The brunette is tightly wound and pinning her with a glare so fierce she's sure the woman is trying to set her ablaze with just a look. Part of her wants to taunt and goad, reminding the woman how she was moaning into her mouth while grinding on her thigh just seconds ago. The other part of her wants to escape the death glare and silent threat to keep her mouth shut simply because she has been here before. She has been the other woman catering to a straight woman's lust because they want something more, something their boyfriends can't give them. She doesn't want to do that again. So, Rio nods her head in agreement. It's not enough.</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha hisses. Rio huffs slightly, shaking her head and making the tip of her canine bite into her tongue to keep her first thoughts to herself. <em>Okay, Agatha, you didn't just moan into my mouth and grind on my leg.</em></p><p>“This never happened.” The pitcher concedes, eyes flashing with hurt but filled with a stubborn fight, jaw clenching shut. Agatha ignores the sudden flicker of feelings behind the cold wall Rio normally wears and and attempts to straighten her dress one more time before leaving the bathroom.</p><p>“You're a mess, clean yourself up Vidal.” Agatha’s bossy, captain attitude feels more like a slap to the face than her actual slap. The door closes and Rio groans at the audacity the woman has to tell her <em>she</em> looks like a mess - after making her look like a mess! Turning toward the mirror, she wipes away any evidence of their clandestine activities and splashes water on her face, returning to the party with one mission - get laid.</p><p>Rio grabs a strong drink for starters then looks over the party goers until she finds soft, feminine eyes watching her. <em>Bingo.</em> It takes seconds for her to chat up the young, brunette woman and pull her into a kiss. It's a good kiss, as good as a straight coed can kiss, but there is a nagging sentence in the back of her mind. <em>She's not Agatha</em>. It pisses her off enough to end the kiss and ask if she wants to go back to her dorm room, creating a distraction for herself. The poor girl nods in agreement and tags along behind Rio who leads them through the crowd with clasped hands.</p><p>Agatha just barely catches sight of raven hair leaving the party with an eager brunette clutching her hand. She bristles at the fact that Rio is choosing some nobody over her. Then she realizes she has no right to be upset. She has Ralph. Agatha told the pitcher, in so many words, to keep her mouth shut and forget what happened. She has no right to be upset.</p><p>So, she doesn't think too hard about why she drags Ralph out to his car and tells him to shut up and keep his hands to himself while she rides him, trying to chase the feeling she felt in the bathroom with Rio. No, she won't think about that at all.</p><p>Ralph, despite her request, keeps <em>touching</em> her and <em>grunting</em>. It is nothing like Rio, who utters soft sighs and caresses, which is amazing and terrible at the same time. Frustrating and relieving all at once. Agatha takes back her control, slamming a hand over his mouth and pinning his hands to the seats, deciding she will come before him and not after. Ralph listens the second time around and waits until Agatha falls over the edge trying, and failing, to think of anyone but Rio. She's not satisfied and she ignores the reason why.</p><p>Ralph smiles up at her, happy as a fucking clam and Agatha picks a fight just to wipe it off his face. The light switch that is their relationship flicks off and Agatha goes home with an itch she still needs scratched.</p><p>Rio doesn't take her time. She doesn't wait for the brunette's first orgasm to finish before starting her second. The woman is a screamer, she might get a stern talking to in the morning but for now, she lets her moans invade her mind because it fills space that would otherwise be occupied by thoughts of her captain. <em>Fuck, stop thinking about Agatha.</em></p><p>Rio buries herself in making the young woman come until she's twitching and pushing her away. The brunette gathers her breath and makes some lame excuse for not returning the favor but she waves off the lack of an offer anyway, scared of where her lust and frustrated mind would take her in the throes of her orgasm. As soon as the woman sneaks out of the door, thoughts of Agatha return. Rio buries her head in her pillow in an attempt to fall asleep before she thinks too much.</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio is struggling to peel her eyes off of Agatha for more than a few minutes. The team is out on the field, stretching before their first game, and the brunette is avoiding her like the plague. It would be fine if she could stop thinking about the way her lips taste and how her heat felt against her thigh. But no, of course, she can’t forget about that. She also can’t avoid how unbelievably hot the brunette looks in the black softball uniform, purple and green accents displaying their names, numbers and team.</p><p>Agatha can <em>feel</em> Rio’s dark, intense eyes on her. It makes her body heat up from more than just the sun. She can forget, she <em>wants</em> to forget but it is…difficult. Nothing she has ever done has felt like that. She’s never been kissed like it’s the last thing they’ll do. How is she supposed to forget about that?</p><p>Blue eyes drift up, drawn to the ones watching her so intently, flicking away as soon as an eyebrow raised. It sends Rio over the edge. Huffing and shaking her head, Rio decides it’s not her job to walk Agatha through what happened between them even if she is desperate to do it again. Especially since she’s been on the frigid side of Agatha’s abnormally cold shoulder since she got to the field.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda start the game off strong, striking out the first three batters on the other team, giving them an advantage. The Witches of Westview are not to be underestimated. Rio was itching to get out on the field but she knows she has to pay her dues and stay in the dug out until she earns her spot. Nonetheless, she enjoys watching her team play, smiling every time Jen tags out a runner on first or Agatha snaps the ball to second during a steal.</p><p>Squatting behind home plate, Agatha felt the familiar stretch in her thighs and the leather snug on her hand as she signaled the next pitch. The game blurred around her, her focus honed in on the Wanda’s eyes and the batter’s stance—until she glanced toward the dugout. Rio was chomping at the bit to get her hands dirty. Her chest tightens at the sight of her mischievous, eagerness buzzing with energy just outside of the dugout.</p><p>The sharp<em> pop</em> of the ball landing in Agatha’s mitt brought her back, and she threw it back to the mound with a touch more flair than necessary. Wanda raises an eyebrow but she shrugs a shoulder and quirks a small smile behind her mask. Agatha is feeling <em>good</em>. It is their first game of the season and they are killing it. Her eyes glance back toward the woman standing inside the dugout and feel a shiver rush down her spine from the smirk she gets in return.</p><p>The tension was palpable as the last inning unfolded, each pitch bringing the crowd to the edge of their seats. The crack of the bat sent the ball soaring, a line drive past the pitcher that forced the shortstop, Monica, into a dive. The ball gets picked up by the third baseman, Calderu, who launches it to first for their second out of the inning. Except Monica isn’t getting up. Herb curses and sends Rio a pointed look before calling a timeout and jogging out to the injured shortstop.</p><p>A quick discussion with the umpire seals the deal. Herb and Sharon are quick to help Monica out of the dirt and wave towards Rio. The shortstop cradles her right wrist and sends the newcomer a sad but supportive smile. Rio can’t help herself. She glances at Agatha who watches her jog out to post up between third base and second. Flexing her glove and dropping both hands to her knees to ready for the next batter. She would rather be on the mound but this will do.</p><p>Agatha’s teeth bite into her bottom lip, trying to keep back a smile. Go figures Rio can pull off the tight black softball team uniform. Maybe Agatha lets her eyes wander before settling back behind home base.</p><p>Bases are empty. They’ll need a strikeout, catch or tag to win. The next batter steps up to the box.</p><p>“Heard you and your boyfriend broke up again,” The blonde stepped up to base mutters to the catcher. Agatha rolls her eyes, the whole team having talked as soon as they stepped up to the plate, and tried really hard to bite her tongue on the <em>have at him</em> that begs to slip from her lips. She hates to admit it, but her priorities are elsewhere - not on Ralph. Wanda sends a fastball that easily lands as a strike. The batter sighs and steadies herself again.</p><p>“Got your eye on someone else? Maybe you’ll join our team, huh?” Another strike. Agatha’s fingers twitch and her eyes jump to the newcomer at shortstop and feels her chest tighten. With her mind distracted she takes a second to call the next pitch, a curve ball. It’s one of Wanda’s best pitches if she lands it right - which she usually does.</p><p>“Your new shortstop looks like she knows how to…<em>hit a home run</em>,” The batter drawls on lecherously with a pleased smirk with the innuendo, finally hitting a nerve with the catcher.</p><p>“Keep your mouth shut so I can watch you strike out, huh?” Agatha breathes out, nodding to Wanda who shakes her head, rejecting the call. The batter chuckles lowly and dark.</p><p>“Damn - the girls had a bet to see who could get to you,” The blonde glances down at the catcher with a flash of amusement in her eyes, “guess I win the pot.” Wanda bristles but finally nods her head. Agatha hopes she rips it over home base with a vengeance. Her jaw clenches shut, nice and tight to keep her lips from biting back.</p><p>“I should probably split it between me and the new hot piece of ass over there.” The woman taunts easily. Agatha sees red but the crack of the bat pulls her from falling over the edge. Wanda curses and groans. The ball flies over second base to land right in the sweet spot deep in the outfield between the two outfielders. The bases are empty, this is the last inning, she's going to rush home plate.</p><p>Agatha groans in frustration and steps out front of the base with her glove raised for the ball. There is nothing she can do but wait and watch the runner tag the bags. Rio snatches the ball out of the air and turns to third base where the runner is already heading home. Agatha steadies herself just outside of the baseline until her glove smacks with the weight of the ball from Rio, side stepping in front of home base. The blonde isn't deterred.</p><p>The runner drops her shoulder and Agatha waits for the painful impact. They both grunt with the hit, Agatha falling harshly onto her back and the breath leaving her lungs.</p><p>Rio feels her chest tighten with the rough hit. She curses under her breath, eyes flashing with anger and concern, and heads for home base right behind the pitcher. Agatha struggles to gather her breath as the runner climbs off of her but her fist closes around the ball in her glove. Wanda rushes to her side, eyes searching for the ball and pointing it out to the umpire who calls the last out of the inning. The Witches of Westview win.</p><p>Agatha is finally catching her breath, one stuttering intake, when Rio takes a knee at her side.</p><p>“Look at me. Deep breath,” Rio demands, using her fingers to turn her head so they're eyes meet. Agatha takes a deeper breath but still struggles to speak, pain flaring in the side that got hit. She's happy she can't speak because the amount of concern and rage in the woman's eyes is stunning.</p><p>“What hurts?” The raven haired woman questions in concern, helping the brunette out of the catcher's mask and pulling the glove from her hand.</p><p>“Fine, just my side. I'm okay.” Agatha breathes out through gritted teeth, thankful for the pads protecting her body because the hit could've been much worse. From experience, her ribs are going to be bruised by the end of the day. Coach will probably sit her out at the next practice.</p><p>“You're sure?” Rio whispers, unfastening the catcher's vest as Herb and Sharon walk over. Agatha nods her head and takes a few more deep breaths. Rio, satisfied that Agatha, while still clearly in pain, is in good hands, sets her sights on the runner smirking at them. Two strides have her squared up to the blonde.</p><p>“I saw you drop your shoulder,” Rio hisses angrily, the blonde smiles wider, so she smiles back, “If you have a problem, I would love to set you straight.” The pitcher threatens swiftly. The blonde laughs, holding up her hands in faux surrender. Agatha stands with the help of Alice and Lilia, spotting Wanda celebrating with their teammates while Rio is toe to toe with the blonde that knocked her down.</p><p>“Relax,” The woman backs up but the pitcher doesn't back off so easily. “What can I say? Your <em>girlfriend</em> is hard to knock down.” Rio doesn't hesitate, pushing forward with her fist raised to start a fight and wipe that smirk off her mouth. Jen quickly grabs her teammate around the waist and drags her back to their dugout.</p><p>Agatha hides her smile from seeing the raven-haired woman trying to push out of the first baseman's arms to get to the other woman. Rio finally relents her fight. Jen raises her hands and shakes her head, calling the newcomer a <em>psycho</em>. Lilia mumbles something along the lines of <em>crazy bitch</em> with an amused smirk.</p><p>Rio grabbed her own bag and Agatha’s, without a word to the brunette but she honestly can't complain with the pain still radiating in her ribs, before walking to the locker rooms with the rest of the team, always keeping the brunette in her eyesight. Sharon and Alice help Agatha into the locker room. Rio is waiting at their lockers, nibbling at her bottom lip with worry.</p><p>“Relax, Rio,” Wanda smiles widely when walking into the locker room and slaps a rough hand on Agatha’s ass, a playful gesture that makes Rio’s gaze darken dangerously. Agatha feels the flush threatening to rise to her cheeks and thanks God for the heat outside causing her cheeks to pink regardless. “Agatha can take a hit.” Wanda winks at her catcher who only glares back in response. It is very hard to ignore the redhead’s priorities after she got hit. Verify the out first, check on her injured teammate later.</p><p>“Oh we know you weren't worried.” Jen says strongly, slamming her locker closed with a glare toward the other woman. Wanda’s smile falls and the celebration from earlier dies down. Uneasiness and tension falls over the locker room. Agatha sighs and leans back against the lockers, curious to see where this goes.</p><p>“You got something to say Jen?” Wanda asks with sparks of anger in her eyes.</p><p>“Your catcher was in the dirt and all you could think about was the damn ball.” Jen points out swiftly, crossing her arms with narrowed eyes. Wanda rolls her eyes and grabs her things from her locker.</p><p>“I've been Agatha’s pitcher for three years. I know when she's fine. So, yeah, I was more worried about the ball, the out - <em>winning</em> our first game of the season.” The redhead bites back, the Scarlet Witch coming out with venom. The team stares and waits for their next move. Jennifer is usually the one to have the last word but even she doesn't know how to respond to that. Well, Rio does.</p><p>“<em>Outfielders</em> could see Agatha feel that hit.” Rio states calmly, eyes lit with a challenge. All eyes turn on her but she only looks at Wanda who spins on her with her own eyes blazing in rage. Agatha is surprised, after how she's been icing the woman out today she didn't expect her to step up against Wanda in her honor. It's exciting and worrisome because they both look like they could kill the other. Looks that could kill and intense eye contact must be a common theme with pitcher's. Maybe she should put an end to this…</p><p>“You don't know Agatha like I do, <em>rookie</em>.” Wanda hisses, stepping closer and closer with each word. Rio stands tall at her advance, daring Wanda to come closer, watching the woman for her next move. Wanda stops with a handful of inches between them but she cuts her gaze onto the catcher.</p><p>“You're good. Right, Agatha?” Anyone who didn't know Wanda would've assumed her tone was demanding but Agatha can hear the desperation in her voice slip through. She knows she fucked up but she can't admit it - not now. Maybe she will apologize later. Agatha clears her throat and shoots Rio a stern look.</p><p>“Like I said earlier, I'm fine, Vidal,” Agatha states strongly. This is the first time today their eyes have been locked for more than a few seconds. The brunette can't tear her eyes away, basking in the intense heat of brown eyes studying her closely.</p><p>“See?” Wanda backs up. Rio nods to Agatha and sends a cautious look to the redhead before backing up to grab her things. The tension in the locker room falls out as Dottie reminds them of their win. Rio grabs her things for the shower when she catches sight of Agatha stripping out of her uniform shirt. The start of some nasty bruising is already spotted across Agatha’s ribs. Rio's jaw clenches and she shakes her head, looking toward Wanda who continues to celebrate their victory.</p><p>“Yeah, you look just fine, Captain.” Rio grumbles, seething with anger at the injured woman's casual disregard of her own wellbeing, as she carefully passes behind the brunette. Agatha closes her eyes at the feeling of Rio's hot body moving behind her, sucking in a breath that makes her wince.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha gathers her things and walks back to the showers. She takes a long shower, letting the hot water run over her bruised ribs in the hope it will ease the ache later on. When she finally emerges from the showers and walks back to her locker, Wanda is the last one in the locker room, waiting for her. Her eyes speak of the apology she has yet to hear aloud.</p><p>“Everyone left?” Agatha questions, pulling on her spare clothes with some painful difficulty. Wanda winces at the catcher's tightening tone and obvious pain.</p><p>“Yeah, I told them I'd look after you.” The redhead says softly. Agatha hums softly, feeling her anger rising without the extra eyes watching them to keep her calm.</p><p>“Listen Agatha, you know I was worried about you right?” Wanda stands, beginning to pace when the brunette stays quiet. “I thought you were okay, truly.” Agatha grabs her bag with a withering look towards her pitcher. Rio was right, <em>outfielders could tell she was hurt</em>. Wanda bristles at the look and silent judgement.</p><p>“You wouldn't have had to take a hit like that if you had called a better fucking pitch.” Wanda bites out in a growl. Agatha laughs in disbelief. <em>Of course it is her fault</em>. Wanda Maximoff can do no wrong. She is sick of it.</p><p>“I called the perfect pitch, you just couldn't get it across the plate.” Agatha hisses back, pulling her bag onto her shoulder with a grimace. “Stop making excuses for yourself and own it Wanda - you were selfish today.”</p><p>“You know what kind of pressure I'm under with that bitch-”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em> helped me before my own pitcher. That says a lot more about you than it does about her.” Wanda huffs and sputters but she doesn't have a comeback so the brunette shoulders past her with a glare. Agatha is so deep in her own mind she jumps when another voice speaks.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio holds back a smile trying to sneak onto her lips from inadvertently scaring the catcher. Agatha looks up at Rio leaning back against the hood of her Bronco.</p><p>“I'm fine,” the catcher answers instinctively. Rio tilts her head and raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“Really?” The dark haired woman asks, watching the other woman make her way to the driver's side door. The brunette sighs, tossing her things into the back seat and sending Rio an exhaustive look.</p><p>“My ribs hurt like a mother fucker. Is that what you want to hear? You want to rub it in Wanda's face now?” Agatha snaps, slamming the door and turning on the other woman, finding her closer than she expected. Her breath catches when Rio’s gaze narrows on her, her proximity pushing the catcher back against the car. Rio is offended and why shouldn't she be? She hasn't given the brunette any reason to think she wouldn't care. She cares a lot more than she would like to.</p><p>“I want the truth - I want to know you are okay.” The pitcher states calmly. Agatha squirms under the other woman's gaze and swallows the guilt of snapping at her.</p><p>“I…” The catcher hesitates, wanting to voice her feelings about more than just her pain, “I <em>will</em> be okay.” She relents, watching the other woman relax slightly and the dark intensity in her eyes dwindle to a simmer. Agatha still feels the butterflies in her chest beating their wings under her gaze. She remembers the last time they stood like this, Agatha pressed up against something solid, but the raven-haired woman was much closer then. Doing dirtier things than just looking.</p><p>As if reading Agatha's mind, Rio steps closer, pushing fallen locks of brown hair out of the other woman's eyes before swiftly pulling her hand away, and clenching her fist. Stopping her hand from venturing and teasing like it had before when they agreed to be lab partners. Now is not the time. Agatha’s body begs to differ, eyes watching the other woman reign herself in when all she can think about is feeling her touch…her lips.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio breathes out softly, shoving her hands into the front pockets of her jeans and taking a step back.</p><p>“I'll see you tomorrow, Captain.” The pitcher mutters, starting the long walk back to her dorm room. Agatha bites her lip to stop herself from calling for the woman. Wanda exits the locker room, berating herself for a plethora of reasons, spotting the newcomer and the catcher parting ways with an intense look between them.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The night of their first big win, the group chat pings with messages of the parties the team will be attending in celebration. Many of the women beg for their captain to be there and Agatha, who doesn't normally indulge in parties, decides she will join. Not because Rio agrees first, no way.</p><p>“You major in <em>Botany</em>?” Dottie questions slowly, already three sheets to the wind and struggling to understand exactly what Botany is. “That's like…plants or uh, plant bodies?” Rio smiles and shakes her head, the blonde being saved from the confusion by Beverly who offers them both another shot.</p><p>Rio has had one already but accepts the second as soon as she spots Agatha walking towards the group, dressed in a tight short skirt and a black jacket. Something tells her she will need that second shot. Jen suddenly appears, just as drunk as the blonde, tossing her arm across Rio's shoulders and tugging her close.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness,” Jen calls out to Agatha waving her over, “What do you think about the nickname, The Green Witch, for Rio?” Agatha pushes through the crowd, to take a promptly offered shot from Beverley, and study how the first baseman's arm hangs around the pitcher's shoulders so casually. She takes the shot before responding.</p><p>“The Green Witch, huh?” Agatha raises an eyebrow, feeling her stomach twist with the pitcher's dark gaze. Rio watches her carefully. She doesn't seem to be in all that much pain but she takes the second shot just as quickly as the first.</p><p>“Yeah, you know cause the plants and everything…green.” Jen reasons soundly, waving around the hand on the woman's shoulder in loose explanation, sipping from her drink that smells heavy of whiskey. Rio chuckles lightly but waits patiently for the other woman's response, her eyes not having strayed from the catcher. From what she has learned Jen likes to ramble when she is drunk which means this should be interesting to watch play out.</p><p>“Yeah, Kale, that's a good one.” Agatha admits with a smirk. Rio’s brow furrows in confusion. She thought it was the alcohol speaking.</p><p>“Uh, sorry, do you two want to clue me in on this nickname?” Jen giggles to herself, shooting the brunette a secretive little grin.</p><p>“We're The Westview Witches, right?” The woman waits for Rio's nod of acknowledgement before continuing, “Well, Lilia is the divination witch, Alice our protection witch, Wanda is the Scarlet Witch, <em>blah blah blah</em>.” The first baseman drawls, leaning heavily on the newcomer and further getting under Agatha’s skin. The woman sways slightly and the catcher's eyes zero in on the dark haired woman's hand that comes to settle on the drunk woman's waist to steady her.</p><p>“Okay, so which <em>witch</em> are you?” Rio questions with a sly smile.</p><p>“The potions witch,” Agatha answers for her with a smirk, knowing the other woman hates it. Jen glares at the other woman.</p><p>“Wicked witch,” The first baseman fires back with a slow smirk climbing onto her lips. Agatha sighs and narrows her eyes before slamming back her third shot. Rio is quick to follow suit, studying the two women in amusement. They have quite the love-hate friendship. Jen gets pulled away so Agatha focuses on the woman in front of her, the party around them becoming dull background noise while they observe one another. Rio tilts her head slightly, curiosity begging her to ask what the brunette is thinking, but she keeps her mouth shut.</p><p>“I've never seen a woman so quick to incite violence - not even Wanda.” Agatha mutters softly, the other woman's brow furrowing. Without thought, Agatha takes a step forward and places a steadying hand on Rio's bicep to speak into her ear. Her mind blanks for a second at the feeling of the strong, capable muscles rippling under her grip but she pushes the words out. The shorter version, but still.</p><p>“You were quick to violence today,” Agatha husks. Rio fights back the shiver threatening to wash down her spine, the brunette's voice dropping low and heating her from the inside out. She smiles and turns her head to whisper back.</p><p>“That bitch dropped her shoulder,” Rio husks, quickly defending her actions, enjoying how Agatha’s smile reaches her eyes and the hand on her bicep tightens for just a second, “I wasn't going to let that slide so easily.” The catcher chuckles softly and turns her head, eyes catching sight of smirking soft lips.</p><p>“You might be as badass as you look,” Agatha whispers, watching the hand on the counter now testing the waters by gripping her hip. Rio, palming her hip, tugs her closer, as an excuse to whisper in her ear as the music gets louder. It's an innocent touch between teammates, nothing for anyone to worry about.</p><p>“Careful, Agatha, that sounded like a compliment.” There is no stopping the dark chuckle from bubbling from her chest. She finds it a lot easier to talk to the other woman when she doesn’t have to look her in the eyes.</p><p>Agatha parts her lips to say something about Rio's inability to keep herself under control, just to rile her up, when the presence of a certain brunette kills the mood with two words.</p><p>“Hi Rio,” The young brunette from the other night greets with bright eyes watching the dark haired woman. Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. Agatha pulls her hand away and takes a step back.</p><p>“Oh, Hi,” Rio mutters in pleasant surprise. After the whole lame excuse to not return the favor the other night she assumed she wouldn't be seeing this one again. The young woman’s eyes glance at Agatha with obvious disinterest before giving the other woman a lecherous smile.</p><p>As if the catcher's departure was an invitation, the younger woman places her own hand onto the pitcher’s bicep, sliding up to press flush against her. Rio twists slightly to accept the move, only after noticing the anger and annoyance on the older brunette's face, wrapping her arm around the young woman's shoulders. She's wondering how far she can push the other woman.</p><p>“Can I steal you away?” The young woman husks, her other hand coming to play with the highest button on Rio's shirt. Agatha is thankful she is three shots in but she needs more, sending Beverly a pleading look. The outfielder is quick to pass her a red solo cup with cranberry and vodka, she mouths a thank you. Rio smirks and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>The young brunette raises her mouth level with her ear, though it doesn't give her the chills like it did with the other brunette. Rio is sure the woman is mumbling something seductive or dirty but all she can focus on is how blue eyes are trying to burn a hole into the woman's head. She hums in acknowledgement and drops her hand lower to rest on the small of the woman's back, pulling her in.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flash with rage, eyes flicking between her hand and dark eyes watching her in amusement. Rio is playing with her and Agatha is falling right into the game and <em>losing</em>. With a scoff, the catcher pushes her way through the crowd, not interested in seeing Rio put her hands on anyone that isn't her. It's stupid and unreasonable, she chalks it up to the alcohol already flowing through her system instead of the possessive jealousy raging inside her.</p><p>“I'll catch you later, yeah?” Rio mutters quickly, pulling out of the woman's grasp and following her catcher with quiet curses. Too far. She pushed her too far.</p><p>Agatha climbs the stairs and pushes into the first unlocked room. A horny couple with wandering hands sits on the bed.</p><p>“Out.” The couple scrambles to get out of the brunette's way. The heat of the party downstairs has her cheeks flaming red, not the raven-haired woman. She rips off her coat just as the other woman enters the room. The thoughtless words leave her lips before she realizes.</p><p>“Oh, is she done humping you already?” Agatha hisses. Rio chuckles helplessly and shuts the door behind her.</p><p>“Don't tell me <em>Agatha Harkness</em> is jealous.” The pitcher walks closer toward the pacing woman, appreciating the low cut of her shirt. Agatha barks out a disbelieving laugh and shakes her head at the audacity this woman has. Her eyes flare with a dangerous warning, the other woman not deterred in the slightest.</p><p>“<em>As if</em>,” Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>“<em>Mhmm, sure</em>,” Rio responds sarcastically. Agatha huffs and sets her sights on the other woman, stalking closer until they are inches away. Her eyes darken with that fucking smirk shinning back at her. The tension between them is thick with anticipation, both women ready to snap with the pressure of it.</p><p>“I'm just disappointed.” The brunette whispers, smiling triumphantly while the taller woman looks down on her with a questioning, dangerous glint in her eyes, knowing this will be the last straw for both of them, “I thought you liked more of a <em>challenge.</em>” The last word leaves her mouth with venom, throwing the pitcher’s words right back at her. Rio pressed closer, chest rising and falling, breathing Agatha in to cloud her mind. The normal steely facade falls and the brunette revels in bringing out the desire and determination in her.</p><p>“You have <em>no idea</em>,” Rio hissed as her hand came up to slide around the back of the brunette’s neck, blue eyes hazing over with lust before closing. The pitcher leans in, her grip tightening when the other woman tries to lean in to connect their lips, she's not going to give in so easily this time.</p><p>Agatha huffs softly in frustration, the drawn out pause forcing their actions to the front of her mind and making her actually <em>think</em>, which is unacceptable. She wants to not think at all. Her hands finding hips to pull the woman forward, forcing her hand. The dark-haired woman smiles teasingly, lips ghosting where the other woman wants them so bad, watching the brunette struggle between restraint and desperation.</p><p>Just when Agatha has had enough, “Stop fucking-”</p><p>Rio is not interested in the insult that was sure to leave her smart mouth, crushing their lips together. Agatha groans into the bruising kiss, relief and lust washing through her as her hands grasp for more friction. Her whole body feels like it's on fire. Her lips part in a pained moan when strong hands skate down her side but it feels so good.</p><p>Rio pulls her hands away, remembering the woman’s bruised ribs, and slows down the kiss. The last thing she wants to do is hurt her. Agatha sighs, bringing her hands up to keep the woman deep in the kiss.</p><p>It’s all wrong. Agatha might be in some pain but it is the last thing on her mind. She wants Rio. She groans in frustration and pushes the other woman away. Rio falls back against the bed, bouncing slightly from the push and watching the brunette in shock.</p><p>“Don’t be so gentle,” Agatha hisses, swiftly straddling the raven-haired woman and sliding a hand into her hair, tugging to pull her head back. Forcing their lips into a rough kiss, the pitcher hisses in pain with the move but eagerly grips onto strong thighs with fingers twitching to dig into muscle.</p><p>Agatha takes the opportunity of Rio’s reluctance to lead the kiss. Searching tongues and clashing teeth, moans and sighs passing back and forth between them. Even still, the hands on her thighs stay caressing and not demanding.</p><p>“How the fuck are you so annoying even now?” Agatha growls once their lips part for air. Rio’s eyes narrow in disbelief.</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt-”</p><p>“If I wanted gentle I would fuck Ral-” Rio lunges forward, shuting her up the best way she knows how and digging her fingers into tense thighs. Agatha moans with the pain of the kiss, her hips grind forward for friction. <em>Finally.</em></p><p>A gasp slips past her lips when the other woman’s hands drift to her ass, rocking her hips forward to grind into her body. A pathetic moan slips past her lips and she breaks the kiss to let her head fall back, hips rolling roughly. Rio kisses down her neck, her mind set on the cleavage in front of her while her hands have a mind of their own, slipping the short skirt up strong thighs to sit around her waist.</p><p>“You would fuck <em>who</em>?” Rio husks, biting at the sensitive skin of her neck before lashing at the sting with her tongue. Agatha can’t speak, her hips jumping with the huskiness of the pitcher’s voice and the fingers in dark hair fists and pushes for more. She wants more. She bites back the whine in her throat that will beg for just that, the embarrassment keeping those words at bay. For now.</p><p>“<em>Ralph?</em>” Rio grumbles with disdain, blunt fingernails biting into soft flesh and dragging to scratch down the back of pale thighs. Agatha moans louder, loving the heavy hands on her body but needing <em>more</em> - always more.</p><p>Rio gets the hint, bringing one hand around, between her thighs, wanting to give the woman something without giving <em>too much</em>. Fingers trail lightly up tensed thighs, a drastic contrast to the rough hand on her ass. It drives Agatha crazy.</p><p>Agatha all but growls, “Rio.” Snapping her head up and yanking on dark hair to connect their gaze. That smug <em>fucking</em> smirk shines up at her.</p><p>“Go ahead - tell me what you want.” Rio whispers soft and encouraging but always challenging, still so smug and triumphant. The other woman keeps her mouth firmly shut even if her eyes rage and her hips grind desperately. Rio concedes, her own resolve falling apart when her finger tips graze the slick heat covering the inside of those thighs, caressing a perfectly wet cunt through a pair of soaked lace panties.</p><p>Rio groans deeply, eyes flashing with a disbelieving desire and tearing apart their connected gaze to observe the arousal on her fingers. <em>Fuck.</em> Agatha and Rio moan together. Her fingers immediately return back to the fire in front of her with a knowing smirk that Agatha leans forward to kiss away. It doesn't work, breaking away to moan again, the dark-haired woman's smile pressing to her chest instead.</p><p>“He can't make you wet like this, can he?” Rio mumbles, swiftly yanking up the shirt in her way and tearing down her bra to mouth at her breasts. Agatha wants to snap back with something witty and hurtful but the other woman isn't wrong. Ralph could never- <em>will</em> never make her as wet as Rio has. She gasps instead, Rio’s hands only getting rougher, arching into the touch and tightening the grip she has on black locks of hair. As soon as the pitcher's mouth finds the nipple she is searching for, she brings her hand back down to the ass in front of her, palming and squeezing to aid the woman in her search for pleasure.</p><p>Agatha gasps and moans as she grinds against the fingers between her thighs, but it isn't enough and she has no doubt the woman below her knows that. Rio chuckles darkly, muffled by the flesh in her mouth, sucking harshly at the nipple between her lips before pulling away.</p><p>“Off - take it off.” She demands, nodding towards the shirt and licking her lips in anticipation. The woman's grip had already shifted to pull off the offending article of clothing as soon as she pulled away from her chest. Without waiting for the next set of demanding words to fly from Rio's mouth, Agatha tosses her bra in that same direction.</p><p>The dark, heated gaze that examines her chest sends a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“Fucking beautiful,” Rio whispers lustfully to herself as her eyes take in the woman on top of her. Her eyes drift to the bruise blooming across heaving ribs and her grinding fingers stutter for only a second but Agatha catches on. A fist comes to tangle in her hair and pull until her neck is cranning to accommodate the demand, groaning happily at the jolt of painful pleasure, and accepting the kiss the brunette crushes against her.</p><p>Rio tears her mouth away, dropping her lips back to her breasts and sliding the flimsy little thong aside to fully touch her. Agatha moans, her hips coming to a stop at the strong hand on her ass moves to hold her hips still.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio mumbles into soft skin, nipping teasingly with a smile, “You're so wet already. I've barely touched you.” The pitcher muses, smiling wider when the brunette's breath catches and her hips squirm under her grasp. Agatha releases another quick frustrated moan and tries to drop her hips for more friction, but those daring fingers bolt out of reach.</p><p>“Do you need something?” Rio questions innocently, kisses and bites trailing up to her neck. Agatha feels what little control she has left slipping and scrambles for more power.</p><p>“You know what I need, <em>you brat</em>.” Agatha gasps when the touch returns, killing the dominance in her voice like a knife cuts through butter. She swallows down the next moan, not wanting the woman to have the satisfaction. Rio chuckles, dark and mischievous, gathering the copious amount of wetness on her fingers to circle around her throbbing clit.</p><p>“I want to hear it,” Rio begins conversationally, stretching her neck up to bring her lips closer to the brunette's ear, “I want to hear the wicked witch beg-”</p><p>Agatha’s nails dig into the back of Rio's neck as she bucks, “I don't <em>beg</em>.” The words slide off her tongue with a growl. The woman below her hums in thought but she still feels the smirking lips against her neck.</p><p>“Hmm, you <em>won't</em> beg,” Rio slides her fingers through her soaked folds to her entrance. Agatha parts her lips to reiterate her statement, <em>don't</em> not <em>won't</em>, there is a difference, but a moan leaks past her lips instead. “Then take what you want.” One finger slides into her pussy, the raven-haired woman biting her lip to keep a moan from leaving her throat at the feel of burning heat wrapping around her. The brunette moans softly in relief, momentarily lost in the pleasure of getting <em>somewhere</em> in this game between them.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows by what the woman is requesting dawns on her when she leans back slightly to watch. Rio expects the catcher to<em> ride her</em>. Her hips grind reflexively, moaning at the movement but forcing herself to stop. Is she really going to do this? Somehow, it feels like losing. Rio raises an eyebrow, expectant and waiting, genuinely curious to see if the other woman follows through.</p><p>“<em>Take it</em>,” Rio urges sternly. It rubs the brunette the wrong way.</p><p>Not one to back down from a challenge, Agatha narrows her eyes and digs her nails into the material on the other woman's shoulders, beginning a steady rhythm of thrusting hips. She leans forward and crushes their lips into another bruising kiss, shoving her tongue past curled lips to take control. She moans deeply into the kiss, one hand tangled in dark hair once more to keep their lips together. <em>Fuck breathing.</em></p><p>Rio moans in surprised pleasure, expecting more of a fight but enjoying the current scenario all the same. She loves the way the brunette moans and sighs into their kiss. She loves the way her nails dig into the material of her shirt, trying so hard to assert dominance even as she loses control each thrust at a time. Agatha, more concerned about the thrusting finger inside of her, begins to lose focus in the kiss. Rio is more than happy to pick up the slack as her free hand glides up the woman's side to cup her breast.</p><p>“Two,” Agatha whispers, trying to make a demand between kisses but it just sounds breathless and pathetic. Rio complies anyway, dropping her hand back down to hold onto the catcher's jogging hips into a pause, sliding a second finger inside along her first. They both moan, Rio's hand moving to the woman's ass with a heavy grip to encourage her to move.</p><p>Agatha tugs her closer, trying to meet thrusting fingers with a harsher roll of her hips as her orgasm coils in the pit of her stomach. She wants it rough and fast. She wants <em>more</em>. Rio notices the tense way her hips stutter and takes it upon herself to help her along, using the hand on her ass to push and pull her down onto her fingers.</p><p>Agatha gasps softly, hips taking everything she can get, grabbing onto a strong shoulder and the pitcher’s thrusting forearm. The heat between her thighs is unquenchable. Nothing can stop her now, not even the pitcher's infuriating smile sneaking into their kiss. Nails dig into tanned skin.</p><p>Rio groans softly at the pinching pain but stays in place, even curling her fingers on every out stroke to bring the woman closer. The fluttering around her fingers tells her exactly what she wants. Agatha moans deeply, breaking their kiss, trying to breathe as her orgasm rushes towards her.</p><p>“Come on, that's it,” Rio breathes, biting at the reddened, flushed chest in front of her. She can feel how the other woman's body refuses to release - refuses to give up control. The catcher moans, the words of encouragement racing to her clit and making her hips buck. So close.</p><p>“Let go,” Rio whispers, sucking a mark into the base of her throat, biting and lashing the bruised skin with her tongue. She shouldn't leave a mark, but she does.</p><p>They shouldn't be doing <em>this</em>, but they are.</p><p>Those two little words seem to do the trick. Agatha bites back a pathetic whine as her muscles deflate, searching for her orgasm, nothing else on her mind. Rio groans as the brunette's grip tightens on her forearm, surely leaving marks of her own. She forces her hand forward through the other woman's grip to make the heel of her palm grind into her throbbing clit just as her lips envelope her nipple to suck with a moan.</p><p>“<em>Fuck,</em>” Agatha moans loudly, thighs shaking and head falling back as her orgasm rushes down her spine. Flashes of white light burst behind her eyes squeezing shut, spine arching with the tension of her orgasm. Her breath catches and her fingers dig into flesh and muscle. Her hips struggle to keep pace but Rio is there, hands and mouth working her through her orgasm with practiced ease.</p><p>Her orgasm deepens just because of it, knowing that the woman wouldn't let her fall over the edge without being there to catch her. The release of finally letting someone else take control is euphoric. All her inhibitions fly out the window. Their connection is strong and alive, something that can’t be ignored anymore. Whatever this is between them is real and they both want it.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” The catcher whines, actually fucking <em>whines</em>, all high and desperate and pleading without saying anything more than her name. Rio crumbles, gives her everything, pushing her into her second orgasm before she finishes the first. The animalistic side of her revels in the feeling of muscles clamping round her fingers and nails in her skin. She wants more.</p><p>Rio wants the brunette naked and thrashing beneath her in orgasm and her cries of pleasure echoing throughout the room. The power and control that Agatha hands over is invigorating. If she thought the kiss was hard to forget…</p><p>Rio’s fingers and palm are coated in the evidence of her orgasms, daring to slick the rest of her arm if she continues. Her eyes glance up to watch the show, Agatha shaking and moaning on top of her, teeth tugging at her bottom lip to keep the louder moans muffled. She loves this. She loves pushing Agatha over the edge, but is too scared to admit she would be heartbroken if it didn't happen again.</p><p>Agatha doesn't let Rio fuck her to a third orgasm, her clit too sensitive and her body drained of any energy as is. The brunette's hand on a flexing forearm weakly tugs until the thrusting pressure stops and she is allowed to ride out the aftershocks with a shaky moan of pleasure. Her head drops forward, burying in Rio's neck, breath shaking with each intake and blood rushing in her ears while she comes down from her high. Rio kisses across her chest before venturing upwards. The room settles, panting breaths the only movement between them.</p><p>They should've known it wouldn't last.</p><p><em>Someone</em> is doing <em>something</em> outside of the room to bang against the door, startling them both into pulling away, sending the brunette clenching stiffly around the fingers still inside of her. Agatha groans softly, eyes slamming shut and heat from both panic, embarrassment and lust flushing her chest red. They wait on bated breath for the door to burst open despite it being loc-</p><p>“Tell me you locked the door,” Agatha whispers softly, trying to keep her voice calm, because she has no memory of herself or the other woman locking the door. Rio swallows roughly, avoiding blazing blue eyes.</p><p>“Ummm,” Rio mumbles, high pitched and definitely guilty. Agatha lets out a frustrated groan and swiftly pulls the annoying woman's fingers from her cunt, immediately missing the warmth of them. She climbs off of her lap, shifting her panties into place with an uncomfortable shiver and working her skirt back down her thighs.</p><p>“You are an idiot. Who fucks someone with the door <em>unlocked</em>?” Agatha screams in a low whisper, grabbing her bra from the ground. Rio sighs, rolling her eyes and trying to ignore her sticky fingers.</p><p>“Exhibitionists,” The other woman quips quickly. Only half regretting it when she gets a furious, unimpressed look in return. Agatha is pissed and if she doesn't play her cards right she won't be coming near her for a long time.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha, it's not like I planned <em>this</em> when I came up here.” Rio defends herself quickly and scours the room, thankful to be at a sorority house and not a frat house, to use a few tissues to wipe off her fingers. Agatha scoffs and yanks on her shirt, sending the pitcher a disbelieving look.</p><p>“<em>Mhmm, sure.</em>” She responds sarcastically, once again throwing the other woman's words right back at her, snatching her coat off of the chair and making a beeline for the door. Rio gets there as soon as she tries to open the door, palm slamming the opening door shut and facing the brunette.</p><p>“We should talk-”</p><p>“<em>Don’t.</em>” Agatha hisses angrily, eyes softening when she sees dark brown eyes flashing with hurt. She can't talk about what they did because it makes it that much harder to ignore. She spots the vulnerability in Rio’s face and knows her own shows the same.</p><p>“Don't.” She says quieter, anxiety crawling up her throat as she pulls open the door and slips back out to the party. Rio slams the door shut behind her.</p>

      Chapter 6: Chapter 6: Down, down, down
  </h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha and Rio are spiraling...towards each other?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is spiraling. She has two papers due by Friday night and she hasn't even begun to write them…it's Thursday.</p><p>It's not her fault. Seriously this time. It isn't her fault because Rio somehow fucked the brains out of her on Saturday night. Then proceeded to annoy the ever loving shit out of her every chance she got. Never directly, always with snide remarks and teasing smirks and eyes that just scream, <em>I've seen you naked</em>. It's infuriating and exhilarating. Agatha hates it- hates <em>her</em>.</p><p>So, she blows off the full team study party at Dottie’s house to cower in her small studio apartment for a little longer. She convinces herself it is because she needs to concentrate and not think about Rio. It's not working so well.</p><p><em>You're so wet already. I've barely touched you.</em></p><p>It is embarrassing how many times Agatha has played the entire scene over and over in her mind. It is even more humiliating when she finds her pretty designer thongs sticking to her by the end of the day. Then her chest clenches tight when she recalls the hurt in dark brown eyes as she left, refusing to speak about what they did. It makes her chest tighten even now.</p><p>She shifts in her spot on the couch, juggling her macbook on strong thighs and looking over the material for her report, noticing the familiar ache between her thighs and groaning in frustration. <em>Not again</em>. She isn't convinced Rio isn't a Witch. She shouldn't be this fucking horny on a Thursday morning. This is Rio's fault.</p><p><em>Come on, that's it.</em></p><p>Teeth dig into her bottom lip until she tastes blood, wincing with the sting but appreciating the reprieve from dirty thoughts - not that it lasts long. More flashbacks, more dirty thoughts flood her mind still struggling to focus on the paper she is supposed to be writing. Maybe she needs it out of her system, one orgasm to get her through. She hasn’t had one since…</p><p>Just as she is entertaining the idea of slipping her hand into her pants, fingertips trailing over the waistband of her pajama pants, the doorbell rings.</p><p>The MacBook nearly flies across the room in her surprise, an odd sense of guilt reddening her cheeks as if she was doing something wrong, catching the laptop before it falls and placing it on the coffee table with a deep breath. The doorbell rings again.</p><p>Agatha doesn't get many visitors, certainly not uninvited ones, so nothing prepares her for who she sees on the other side of the door.</p><p>“<em>Mother?</em>” She gawked in shock.</p><p>Evanora Harkness smirks, knowing very well her daughter hadn’t planned on her arrival, and raises her eyebrows expectantly. Taking a second to briefly look down at the young woman’s attire. Plaid pajama pants, oversized sweatshirt, a messy bun haphazardly sitting on top of her head and glasses slipping down her nose. The look of disapproval makes Agatha’s stomach coil uncomfortably.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to invite your dear mother in?” Evanora asks, a fabricated sweetness lilting in her voice. Agatha, already thrown off by the surprise, unwelcome visit, takes a stuttering step back from the doorway without hesitation. Evanora walks in with a sway of her hips but stops as soon as she notices the mess of the small studio apartment, setting her purse down on the counter with hesitance.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” The sharp disappointment in her mothers voice makes Agatha wince, shutting the door a little too hard before grabbing what pieces of the mess she can reach. Take out containers and clothes strewn across the apartment with carelessness. So, she’s gotten a little lazy. She’s busy with two degrees and softball, sue her for not wanting to clean at the end of the day.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting company,” Agatha mutters under her breath, shoving trash into the already overflowing can. Evanora hums in barely feigned understanding, observing the rest of the room with disgust.</p><p>“You should have accepted my very generous offer of a weekly maid,” The older woman says strongly, sending her daughter a pointed look towards the mess of old pizza boxes, “maybe a private chef too?”</p><p>Agatha snatches the boxes off of the counter and stuffs them behind the trashcan to throw out later. She takes a deep breath and fixes her mother with a narrowed look.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” the younger woman says strongly but the fight leaves her body when a terrifying darkness glints in similar blue eyes. “Thank you. I’m just behind on cleaning. It’s been a busy week.” Evanora smiles at that.</p><p>“Classes are going well then?” It’s not a question even if she phrases it like it is. It is an expectation - a bar set high and almost always out of reach. Almost. Luckily, this semester has gone better than the last and she has nothing lower than a ninety-six in every class. The ninety-four she got in Algebra last semester sent her mother into an hour-long lecture about success. She will not be sitting through that again.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha responds confidently. The pause in their words creates an uneasy tension in the air and makes Agatha shift on her feet, bringing her mind back to the uncomfortable feeling of sticky underwear. The urge to run to the bathroom to change is eating at her. She wonders if her mother’s normally intuitive investigative skills are working. If Evanora knows what she was about to do before the doorbell rang.</p><p>“And your…<em>extracurriculars</em>?” Evanora bites out with disdain, eying the bag of the brunette’s softball gear by the door. Agatha rolls her eyes, knowing her mother doesn’t actually care about anything but her studies, but answers regardless. Always searching for validation from the one woman who never gives it.</p><p>“Good - great actually. We started the season off strong and won our first game.” Agatha lifts her chin with pride and a satisfied smile on her lips. Evanora flicks her gaze from the bag to her daughter and stalks closer, unimpressed as always. Her strong fingers come to grip Agatha’s chin, tugging her head higher and forcing the younger woman’s neck into an uncomfortable stretch. The catcher’s brow furrows in confusion.</p><p>“That’s where you got this?” A thumb presses painfully into the cut on her lip. Agatha hisses in pain and tries to jerk her head away, panic flaring in her chest. Strong fingers keep her chin in a bruising grip to study her reaction.</p><p>Agatha forces the thought of herself on the couch only moments ago from her mind. Hiding the thought from the woman who may as well be able to read her mind and nods in agreement. Her mother thinking her split lip is from softball and not…<em>you know</em> is a sacrifice she will have to make.</p><p>“That <em>sport</em> is undignified and belligerent,” Evanora hisses darkly, releasing her daughter’s chin with a stern glare, “You’re a Harkness. You need to act the part. A split lip doesn’t exactly speak of the professionalism I need from you.” Agatha is used to the lecture she receives about her<em> unrefined sport</em> of choice but the talk of professionalism is a new addition to the normal degrading speech. Her eyes narrow suspiciously.</p><p>“Why are you here mother?” Agatha questions swiftly. Evanora fabricates a look of offense, the younger of the two barely containing the roll of her eyes.</p><p>“I can’t visit my only daughter for no reason at all?” Agatha waits patiently, knowing the act will drop as quickly as she plays it. Evanora lets the facade drop with grace and a forced smile. “I want you to attend the Westview Spring Gala and network for Harkness Energy.”</p><p>“No,” The rejection leaves Agatha's lips as soon as her mother finishes.</p><p>“Our partners should know who their next CEO is.” Evanora reasons, watching her daughter fall onto the couch and tug the MacBook back into her lap.</p><p>“<em>Please</em>, you will die at your desk when you’re old and decrepit and even then you will haunt me from the grave everyday.” Agatha grumbles angrily, trying to busy herself with the report she can’t seem to focus on for a plethora of reasons. It makes her feel a little better to know Rio is just one of many and not the sole reason.</p><p>Evanora purses her lips and narrows her eyes dangerously on her daughter. She takes a few strides forwards and closes the laptop harshly, nearly crushing the younger woman’s fingers in the device. Her hand stays firmly on the laptop as she leans over her daughter, imposing her dominance with ease. Blue eyes snap up to meet a reflection of blue filled with wavering patience and diminishing restraint.</p><p>“Let’s try that again,” Evanora whispers far too calmly with an edge in her words, sending a shudder through the younger woman, “You <em>will</em> attend the Westview Spring Gala to network for Harkness Energy.” An eyebrow raises in a silent question, daring her daughter to refuse the demand. Agatha nods once, sharp and reluctant, tearing her eyes away. A barely pleased smile crosses the older woman’s lips.</p><p>“Good,” The annoyance in her voice is obvious, pulling away with a sigh that speaks of her lack of patience, “Bring that charming boy with you. Randy, is it?” Evanora swipes her bag off of the counter and makes for the door. Agatha quickly sits up.</p><p>“No.” The single word makes the older woman spin on her heel with a death glare from hell, not wanting to fight with her daughter again, her patience as thin as tissue paper now.</p><p>“W-We broke up.” Agatha explains quickly, stuttering over her words and nervously picking at the fabric of her sweatshirt. Evanora huffs and shakes her head. The brunette can feel the disappointment and rage filtering off of her in waves.</p><p>“<em>Fine</em>,” It’s not fine, but it is tolerable, for now, “The Maximoff girl then? Her family is well respected in the Westview circles.” Agatha doesn’t like that either, considering their latest fight has them both avoiding each other, but it is certainly a better option than <em>Ralph</em>, not <em>Randy</em>. She agrees with a nod. Evanora plasters on another smile.</p><p>“Tomorrow night at eight o’clock. I’ll have two dresses sent over and a driver for you girls.” Evanora leaves with a flourish of flipping grey hair, shutting the door loudly behind her. Agatha groans and lets her head fall back onto the couch, dreading Friday night before it even arrives in twenty-two hours. Twenty-two hours, too soon.</p><p>Rio hates the dorms. They smell of body odor and weed, literal children playing music too loud and shouting down the halls. That is why she is studying at the library at ten o’clock at night so she can focus. There is nothing wrong with her grades. She obsessively checks them more than three times a day so she knows not a single class is below a ninety-eight, but she worries regardless.</p><p>Eastview Community College shut down and the state gave her a full ride to Westview University <em>if</em> she keeps her grades up, participates in the college community, and stays out of trouble. Without that scholarship she would be sleeping on the street working at a pathetic fast food chain. Good grades, softball and refusing the joint offered to her as she walked out of her dorm is all for a good reason. The library has been her sanctuary, a reprieve from distractions since she arrived in Westview.</p><p>Except, Agatha Harkness is a distraction she can’t escape. The catcher plagues her mind all day, every day. It doesn’t matter how much she drinks or how many women she fucks. Agatha is the only thing Rio can’t stop thinking about.</p><p><em>Rio</em></p><p>That whine of desperation in Agatha's voice had sent her reeling with animalistic desire. It still does, her thighs clenching together at the memory. Rio groans in frustration and tightens her grip on the pen in her fist.</p><p><em>Focus.</em></p><p>Her ringtone cuts through the quiet library, earning her more than a few glares and shushes to keep quiet. With a glare to each set of eyes that dare to meet her own, Rio answers the call without looking.</p><p>“What?” Rio hissed.</p><p>“Rio,” Fuck, it's Herb, a disapproving sigh echoing across the phone at the way she answered.</p><p>“Shit, sorry Coach,” She apologizes but the man on the phone is already sighing again at the curse she lets slip. Rio rolls her eyes at herself.</p><p>“I had a job offer for you but if you're going to talk like that…” Herb trails off but Rio jumps at the offer, sitting up straighter as if he would be able to tell how serious she is taking the call now.</p><p>Herb and Sharon are the only people on the team who know of her predicament. She has a full ride sure, but she still needs money for literally anything else the school won't pay for. Like equipment for softball, transportation and clothes, etc. However, with her schedule, she can't swing a normal job or even a God awful fast food restaurant schedule. So, Herb and Sharon send her one off gigs that are easy enough for a college student and usually for a decent chunk of change.</p><p>“No, no I can do it. Whatever you need, Coach.” Rio responds quickly. Herb makes an unconvinced noise from the back of his throat but continues regardless.</p><p>“The Westview Spring Gala is short a few heads for servers. It doesn't pay a lot but if you act right you should be able to make decent cash in tips. There's a lot of old money attending this year.” Herb offers. Rio sighs in relief, money being a constant worry and her stash of cash has been getting low.</p><p>“I'm in. Let them know I can bartend.” Rio accepts quickly.</p><p>“Really? Where did you" Herb questions in surprise. “Nevermind. I feel like I don't want to know.” The pitcher confirms and the call ends with Rio feeling a little better about her situation.</p><p>Agatha drags at practice Friday evening after staying up all night to finally finish those two papers, freeing up her Friday night for the Gala she really doesn't want to go to. The only plus side to the event is having Wanda come with her, if she agrees.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha greets softly, panting for breath as they finish practice and walk back toward the locker rooms. Wanda gives her a small glance filled with surprise and relief.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda responds softly. A few moments of silence keep both of them on their toes until Agatha bites the bullet the best way she knows how.</p><p>“My mom is here.” Wanda's eyes widened in surprise but also concern. They have been friends long enough to know the stress Evanora's presence puts on the catcher. “Yeah, and I need your help,” Agatha admits shortly.</p><p>“Okay…what is it?” The redhead asks suspiciously.</p><p>“Mother is forcing me to go to this Westview Gala thing but I broke up with Ralph so I can't bring him. Will you go with me?” Agatha throws the words out of her mouth as fast as she can, stepping into the locker room with a hopeful look in her eyes. The last thing she needs is to attend this event alone. Wanda, still a little upset about their fight, bites back with a retort.</p><p>“You don't want to ask <em>Rio</em> first?” Agatha sighs and pins the other woman with a pointed look. Wanda actually looks a little guilty for bringing the other woman into it.</p><p>“Come on Wanda. You know you're my first choice, always.” Agatha really sells it, taking the redhead's wrist in her hand and staring her down with a pleading look. “Plus, my mother got us fancy, designer dresses being delivered to my apartment tonight.” The pitcher’s eyes light up at the thought and a sly smile crosses her lips.</p><p>“I'm sold,” Wanda agrees readily, smiling wider with Agatha’s breath of relief, but she can't help but get in another dig at the secondary pitcher while the locker room is still mostly barren. “Can you imagine <em>Rio</em> in a <em>dress</em>? I'm not sure she owns <em>slacks.</em>” Agatha forces a smile, imagining Rio in either option and feeling herself getting hotter and hotter because of it.</p><p>Rio catches the insult on the way into the locker room. It doesn't bother her. She has heard things like that her entire life for many different reasons. She isn’t worried about Wanda Maximoff judging her, Agatha Harkness however, she hates to admit she does worry about what she thinks.</p><p>Speak of the devil, “Got plans for the weekend, captain?” Rio husks, giving the other woman a genuine smile. It's an innocent question and a sweet smile but those eyes, once so guarded, speak of nothing but <em>filth</em>. Knee shaking, moan and groan, rough hands type of filth she knows the other woman can deliver. Her stomach flips with the attention. Even more so when eyes drop down her body suggestively. Agatha flushes but sends a quick warning glare, turning away slightly to finish taking her shirt off, ready to respond.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Wanda exclaims in surprise, making Agatha freeze and look at the other woman, standing top less in front of the whole team. “Did Ralph become a vampire overnight?” Wanda laughs at her own wit and points to the deep hickey at the base of Agatha’s throat. Rio can't help it, she smirks in satisfaction.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asks in confusion, raising her hand up to her neck. Jen produces a small handheld mirror and holds it out to the catcher, looking impressed by the hickey. The catcher angles the mirror just right and gasps softly, touching the dark bruise with her fingertips. Agatha flushes red, eyes flickering to the raven-haired woman at her side who looks far too smug, rage and panic flaring inside of her. Agatha is going to have a talk with Rio.</p><p>“Hold on, I thought you and Ralph broke up?” Wanda saunters closer with intrigue and curiosity glinting in her eyes. Agatha struggles to gather her words when Rio raises an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p>“We did-”</p><p>“So, are you going to tell us who the lucky man is?” Wanda smirks. Her and the whole team pinning her with an expectant look. Rio fucking chuckles and Agatha is losing her mind. So, she tells them something that isn't the truth just to teach Rio a lesson. She hopes.</p><p>“Oh, no one special. Just a guy trying to <em>desperately</em> get in my pants.” Agatha explains swiftly, smiling to herself and leaning back against the lockers with crossed arms. Rio wasn't expecting that. Her brow furrows and Agatha sees it, spurred on to continue the lie.</p><p>“You should've seen him Wanda, he couldn't keep his hands off of me. It was a little…<em>pathetic</em>.” Wanda laughs and Rio feels her chest flare hot with unreasonable anger. The brunette isn't really talking about their hook up, right? She definitely couldn’t keep her hands off of the other woman but she is not pathetic.</p><p>“Was he good at least?” The redhead wonders, on the edge of her seat for more drama.</p><p>Agatha scoffs, “He…<em>scratched an itch</em>.” A shrug and sly smirk finishes it off. Rio shuts her locker probably too loudly and squeezes past the brunette and redhead. Her eyes catch blue. Agatha feels her stomach roll with the fire and determination in dark brown eyes. A promise of something dark and dirty if Agatha was to take another chance with her. She wants to. <em>God</em> does she want to.</p><p>The conversation fizzles into the women’s one night stand stories. Wanda hands her a bottle of concealer accompanied with a smirk. The locker room clears out quickly on a Friday night. Wanda agrees to come over to Agatha’s apartment a few hours before the Gala and leaves with a wave. Agatha is the last person in the locker room, packing up her bag and dreading the night ahead of her. So she thought.</p><p>“Captain,” Rio greets softly, smirking when the other woman jolts in surprise. Agatha breathes out the sharp gasp and sends a glare to the dark haired woman who doesn’t seem concerned at all for scaring her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha mutters back, zipping up her bag to escape the other woman quickly. Especially because the newcomer has a habit of returning to her locker half dressed and still dripping with water from her shower, smelling of sage and amber, daring to draw the other woman in every time.</p><p>“<em>Scratched an itch</em>, huh?” Rio questions bitterly, the helpless voice in her head needing to know it was more than that between them. She hates the little voice in her head. Agatha freezes, glancing at the woman before looking over her shoulder at the rest of the locker room. It’s empty but the panic twists her stomach anyway.</p><p>“We are not talking about this - not here, not at all.” Agatha hisses, tugging her bag onto her shoulder. Rio chuckles softly, pulling her sweatpants up toned thighs. The catcher has to look away but it doesn’t matter. She already knows what the woman looks like half naked and the urge to see more has been begging to be unleashed for a while now.</p><p>“You were happy to talk about it with the whole team.” Rio reminds her, pulling on her shirt and walking closer to the woman who finally looks at her again. Agatha’s eyes flash with anger and disbelief.</p><p>“You left a <em>hickey</em>. What are you twelve? What else was I supposed to do?” Agatha growls, stepping up to the other woman, breathing in the scent that is just <em>Rio</em>. It dulls her senses for a second. The pitcher glances down at where the mark should be and sees nothing but skin, brow furrowing before it dawns on her. Agatha covered it up.</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches, watching the woman’s eyes grow darker with each moment that passes. Her heart beats faster as Rio’s hand raises and her fingers caress the side of her throat and her thumb passes over the said hickey. Rio brings her thumb to the base of her throat and wipes away the makeup covering the bruise.</p><p>“You tell anyone who asks that the person who gave you this hickey made you come- <em>twice</em>, harder than you ever have before.” Rio whispers darkly, eyes locking onto hazy blue when she is satisfied the hickey is on full display once again. Agatha’s lips part to speak but nothing comes out because she is right. Of course she is right.</p><p>“I would even tell you to say it was a woman who fucked you so well.” Rio continues, her hand sliding back and up her lilith neck to tangle in brown locks. Agatha feels like she’s under a spell, incapable of moving or speaking. Completely silenced by the wicked woman in front of her and she loves it. She missed it. The coil of heat in the low of her belly burns hot and yearns for more.</p><p>“God knows a man couldn’t make you come as hard as I did - certainly not twice.” A soft huff of a laugh, amused by just the thought, and a curl of a smirk tugs at her lips. Agatha closes her eyes, trying to just <em>breathe</em> for God’s sake, but her eyes flash open with a soft gasp when the hand in her hair tugs. Rio watches the brunette carefully, satisfied with the lustful gaze that shines back at her.</p><p>Agatha slowly gets her voice back, “I…I can’t have hickeys Rio.” She didn’t really mean to say <em>those</em> words. Wanting to put up a fight and throw some harsh words at the raven haired woman to take that smirk off her lips. Rio’s other hand comes up to cup her cheek, thumb stroking softly across her cheekbone.</p><p>“You can’t have hickeys or you can’t have <em>visible</em> hickeys?” Rio questions calmly, softly so she doesn’t scare the brunette off. Something inside of her craves Agatha Harkness in any and every way possible. So, she’ll take this, sneaking off to be together in private. Treating the other woman gentle and undaunted. She will take this, Agatha all to herself and bared to her eyes only.</p><p>Agatha’s brain might’ve actually malfunctioned at the thought of Rio’s lips on other parts of her body. Parts that aren’t exposed to the world. She swallows roughly, forcing herself to speak calmly and not so eagerly with that thought running through her mind, conjuring images she can only dream of- for now.</p><p>“Visible,” Agatha chokes out, licking her lips when brown eyes drop her gaze. Rio hums low in her chest, a small noise of approval that makes Agatha want to melt, pulling the other woman closer. Blue eyes slip shut as the other woman’s warmth presses close, the smell of her woodsy body wash and sound of soft breathing fills her senses. She waits for their lips to press together. Rio is seconds from closing the distance.</p><p>“Girls?” Rio steps back quickly with a silent curse of frustration, Sharon Davis’s voice ringing through the locker room from the entrance, not far enough to see the two women, “Anyone still in here?” Agatha feels the panic bubbling in the pits of her stomach, quickly quenching the coil of heat, as she clears her throat and tries to claw back some semblance of her mind, responding quickly.</p><p>“Just me, Coach. I'm leaving now.” Agatha hates that her voice cracks in the transition between lustful and professional, grimacing. If it had been anyone else they may have ventured further into the locker room to investigate. But Sharon Davis trusts her captain and leaves her with a cheerful call for her to have a goodnight. Rio, knowing any further pushing or exploration of them would send Agatha running, grabs her bag.</p><p>“I’ll talk to you later, Captain,” Rio whispers softly, a meaningful look in her eyes as she passes the other woman. Agatha watches her leave before relief and regret washes through her. With a heavy sigh, the brunette adjusts the bag on her shoulder and heads out to her car, the night of the Gala weighing down on her already.</p>

      Chapter 7: Chapter 7: Westview Spring Gala
  </h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio is really good at bartending...and other things.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Rio takes a deep breath, smiling at her next customer and pouring </span><em><span>another</span></em><span> glass of red wine. Herb was right, the Gala is filled with old money. Old money that really enjoys expensive red wine and two fingers worth of even more expensive whiskey. </span></p><p><span>She almost regrets being a bartender until she sees a twenty dollar bill slipping into the tip jar from the man who has already ordered two whiskeys. He winks at her when he does it so she smiles brightly. It’s a very fake smile but he doesn’t know that. </span></p><p><span>Rio is in the middle of sliding another wine glass filled with red across the bar counter when her gaze is completely torn from the customer. Agatha walks into the Gala and Rio feels her chest tighten and her stomach flip at the sight of her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is dressed in a striking black evening gown, featuring a strapless neckline with a deep, plunging sweetheart cut, the bodice is form-fitting, accentuating the brunette’s silhouette, and transitions seamlessly into a long, floor-length skirt that flows elegantly. </span></p><p><span>Agatha straightens her spine when her mother’s fingers dig painfully into her back with a muttering of ‘shoulders back, dear’ whispering into her ear. She forces a smile and nods towards some of the guests watching them enter the Gala. </span></p><p><span>The venue is a grand and opulent space. The room features soaring ceilings with intricate architectural details, creating a sense of grandeur. Dominating the space are large, glittering chandeliers that cast a warm, golden glow across the room, enhancing the atmosphere of luxury. The lighting is dramatic yet elegant, with amber uplights highlighting the ornate columns and walls, giving the venue a rich and sophisticated ambiance.</span></p><p><span>The dining setup consists of long, impeccably arranged banquet tables draped in black tablecloths, paired with sleek silver chairs that add a modern touch to the classic elegance. The tables are adorned with sparkling glassware, flickering candles, and refined floral centerpieces that enhance the extravagant feel. </span></p><p><span>Off to the side of the long room are a few bars stocked high with wine and liquor, Agatha suddenly feeling herself in need of a very strong drink. Her eyes find Wanda only a few steps away, appreciating the sophisticated black evening gown her mother had sent over for the other woman. </span></p><p><span>The dress has a V-shaped neckline with thick, structured straps that provide a classic yet contemporary look. The bodice is tailored to fit closely to the body, creating a flattering silhouette, while the skirt has a wrap-like style with a high slit, adding a touch of elegance and allure. </span></p><p><span>Evanora had gushed over the redhead as soon as they stepped into the town car. It was probably all an act even though the dress does look amazing on her. Agatha barely received so much as an appreciative glance. Retribution for Agatha bringing Wanda instead of Ralph, she assumes. She told herself she didn’t care but at the end of the car ride she was seething at her mother’s ability to ignore her and praise Wanda instead. Even the redhead noticed and quickly dulled her reaction to the compliments. Not that it helped Agatha feel any better. </span></p><p><span>“Wanda, do you want to get a drink?” Agatha requests hopefully, trying to desperately escape her mother’s judgemental gaze. Wanda opens her mouth to respond but Evanora is quicker. </span></p><p><span>“Bring me a red wine, would you dear?” Evanora asks sweetly, eyes flickering darkly and pushing Agatha closer to the edge of madness. “Wanda?” The older woman turns back to the pitcher who flounders for words for a second. </span></p><p><span>“Sure, I’ll have the same.” Wanda answers, trying to move towards the brunette, “I should help you-”</span></p><p><span>“Oh no, Wanda, I have someone for you to meet. Agatha can handle it, can’t you?” Evanora swiftly wraps the redhead’s arm in her own, pulling Agatha’s lifeline right out from under her. </span></p><p><span>“Of course, Mother.” Agatha responds quickly, smiling through the fury and pain as Wanda is whisked off to speak to God knows who, about God knows what. The redhead sends her a helpless look. The brunette spins on her heels and stalks towards the bar with her order already in mind, a classic and very strong vodka martini.</span></p><p><span>“What can I get you, </span><em><span>Captain</span></em><span>?” She hasn’t even fully reached the bar, caught up in her own mind to notice </span><em><span>who</span></em><span> she was walking towards, stuttering in her steps when blue eyes meet brown. She stables herself on the bar, lips parting in shock at the sight of Rio Vidal behind the counter. </span></p><p><span>The dark haired woman is dressed in a white dress shirt, one two many buttons undone to be accidental, and tight black slacks. Her hair pulled back in a low bun with locks flowing in the front to frame her face. Wanda was so incredibly wrong - Rio looks </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>. Suddenly Agatha isn’t so worried about her mother but the heat reigniting between her thighs from the reminder of their encounter in the locker room earlier that day. </span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” Agatha whispers. Rio smiles and nods her head towards the tip jar on the counter. </span></p><p><span>“I needed to make some cash,” She explains simply, gaze dropping down to study the catcher’s gorgeous form in that dress, “What are you doing here?” Agatha’s chest turns pink from Rio’s heated look. She knows the other woman sees it because she smirks that fucking smirk and stares with eyes that are mentally undressing her. </span></p><p><span>“My mother is in town for the Gala. She wanted me to network for the company.” Agatha shifts on her feet with Rio’s surprised hum. </span></p><p><span>“Ah, so you need alcohol. What can I get you?” Rio asks curiously as she reaches for a glass, pausing with a hopeful look towards the brunette. “Please don’t tell me you want red wine.” A bright smile fires back at her and she realizes she really wants to see it again. </span></p><p><span>“Two red wines,” Agatha begins, the pitcher’s disappointed sigh makes her chuckle softly, “and a very strong vodka martini for myself.” Rio smiles in relief and quickly pours the two glasses of wine. </span></p><p><span>“Thank God. I've been pouring wine and whiskey for the past hour.” The bartender mutters, starting on the martini with practiced hands. Agatha watches in awe. Rio would be stupid to admit the brunette’s gaze actually makes her a little nervous but she hides it well. </span></p><p><span>“Where did- How do you know how to, uh, bartend?” Agatha stutters, recovering quickly to push the fumbling words out but Rio doesn't draw attention to it, simply placing a chilled martini glass between them. </span></p><p><span>“Just something I picked up over the years,” Rio admits casually, shrugging and filling the glass with the drink and a lemon twist. “Let me help you carry these.” The offer is generous but as soon as it leaves her lips Agatha can't stand the thought of her mother getting her claws into Rio. </span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha bites out quickly, fighting back a flush when the other woman raises an eyebrow in surprised curiosity, “I'll come back for my drink. It'll give me another break from my Mother.” The brunette smiles and relaxes when she sees Rio’s understanding gaze. Not pity or confusion, just reasonable understanding and it warms her chest more than it already is. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, where have you been?” Evanora questions, a smile present in the company of others but Agatha knows her Mother well. Her tone could slice her like daggers. Her shoulders immediately pull back to straighten her spine with her voice, tension filling her like a boiling pot of water. Only one thing crosses her mind, get her mother away from Rio.</span></p><p><span>“I was just on my way,” Agatha says quickly, passing her mother one of the glasses of wine and grabbing her own drink. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>?” Wanda questions in shock, eyes dropping down the bartenders form in surprised appreciation. </span></p><p><span>“Wanda,” Rio greets quickly, smirking at the redhead's initial reaction. Agatha sighs and bites at her bottom lip nervously, her eyes flicking between the three women. Evanora, turns her gaze to the young woman and studies her, peeved to find that she doesn't squirm under her gaze but meets her eye to eye. Rio smiles politely but she has heard enough about Evanora Harkness to know that the catcher and her don't have the best mother-daughter relationship. If the way Agatha’s entire body tensed wasn't a clear sign then she doesn't know what is. So, she stands tall and offers the woman and Wanda a forced smile. </span></p><p><span>“You two know each other?” Evanora wonders aloud, her eyes not drifting from the raven haired woman, gaze dark and dangerous but the other woman doesn't look away. </span></p><p><span>“Rio is on the softball team with us.” Wanda informs casually, frowning at the glare her best friend shoots her way. Evanora's eyes flash with disinterest and annoyance, but never one to drop appearances, holds out her hand to the young woman behind the bar. </span></p><p><span>“Evanora Harkness, CEO of Harkness Energy. Agatha’s mother,” The older woman greets, the line flowing off her tongue practiced and proud. The younger Harkness can count on one hand how many times she has heard her mother refer to herself as her mother. Rio takes her hand for a quick and firm shake.</span></p><p><span>“Rio Vidal, it's a pleasure to meet you.” Evanora hums in feigned interest, making a show of pulling her hand away to grab a napkin to </span><em><span>wipe off her hand</span></em><span>. As if touching one of the workers would give her a disease or turn her poor. Agatha groans internally, stomach twisting sickly, and pins her mother with a glare. </span></p><p><span>“Charmed,” Evanora mutters, meeting her daughter's glare with one of her own. Rio just barely contained a scoff and a roll of her eyes. Agatha feels the tension daring to bubble over, quickly merging with anger. Wanda almost laughs but manages to turn it into a cough at the last second, also earning herself a glare from the brunette.</span></p><p><span>“Come along, Agatha. We have people of importance to speak to.” Evanora wraps her arm up in Wanda’s to cart her off once more, an unapologetic smirk on her face now. Agatha sighs heavily and winces at the terrible phrasing she has no doubt her mother used to make her departure blunt and dismissive. Rio lets out a small huff of a chuckle and shakes her head in disbelief. She hasn't met a woman so far up on her high horse in a long time. At the noise, Agatha turns back to the dark haired woman. </span></p><p><span>“I’m sor-” </span></p><p><span>“You're not your mother,” Rio cuts off the apology quickly, fixing the other woman with that same understanding look, “Don't apologize for her.” Agatha’s jaw snaps shut, surprised and relieved. For once, someone understands her. Rio understands her. She wants to stay huddled around the bar, watching the other woman make cocktails and see the predatory glint in her eyes every time they speak. Unfortunately, Evanora is already calling her back to the masses. Despite the pitcher's warning, she sends her an apologetic look anyway, hoping it conveys the apology she was going to give. Rio chances a wink at her departure and smiles when blue eyes shine with a glint of excitement. </span></p><p><span>Agatha and Wanda are led and presented to anyone and everyone Evanora can introduce them to, easily creating business connections between Harkness Energy and others. Agatha doesn't mind the networking, finding it exhausting but worthwhile in the long run. However, the constant praise of Wanda and back handed compliments to Agatha are getting old quickly. The younger Harkness is on her third round of martini when the last straw lands heavy into her chest, and it isn't even about her. </span></p><p><span>“I'll get the next round,” Agatha offers, a smile on her lips and taking the small escape towards a particular bar with a very specific bartender just within eyesight. A hand closes around her wrist and keeps her grounded.</span></p><p><span>“You will slow down. I don't need potential investors and partners thinking my daughter is a drunk.” Evanora steps slowly, her height advantage allowing her to look down at the younger woman. She is smiling, keeping up appearances as always, but her eyes speak of the consequences if her commands are disobeyed. Agatha clenches her jaw and sighs, feeling the stubbornness grow within her as it usually does when it comes to her mother. Not to mention the alcohol has given her the liquid courage she needed to fight back. </span></p><p><span>“How else am I supposed to survive this event you've dragged me to?” Agatha questions softly. Evanora's smile drops and her eyes narrow. </span></p><p><span>“That is what Wanda is for,” Evanora hisses, her grip tightening on the brunette’s wrist. Agatha scoffs, shifting her hand in an attempt to loosen her mother's grip, a little bit of panic flaring in her chest when she can't shake her. </span></p><p><span>“You've managed to make her into your personal puppet.” Agatha’s eyes glance over Evanora's shoulder, the redhead spewing facts of Harkness Energy that the older woman has been discussing all night. It's disappointing to see Wanda so enthralled with her mother. At least Rio can hold the CEO’s eyes without a touch of hesitation. </span></p><p><span>“Is that why you've been running to that </span><em><span>bartender </span></em><span>all night?” Evanora's words are laced with barely contained disgust with the title. Agatha’s eyes flare with rage and her mother smirks at the sight of it. “You're mad Wanda is able to be </span><em><span>useful</span></em><span> to me so you've run to the first person to pay attention to you, is that it?” A mocking pout crosses her features. Agatha feels her cheeks heat with rage and embarrassment. The implication that she isn't useful or has the desire for attention isn't an uncommon accusation from her mother. It's the fact that she brought </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> into this. </span></p><p><span>Rio just barely catches sight of the brunette, having been watching her as often as she can when the catcher isn't at the bar, and notices the tension between mother and daughter. She notices the grip the older woman has on the brunette’s wrist and wonders if it is as painful as it looks.</span></p><p><span>“That's not-” </span></p><p><span>Evanora doesn't let her finish, “You are better than the </span><em><span>bartender</span></em><span> Agatha. You are a Harkness. Pull yourself together and return to the party - we will be discussing your outburst later.” The older woman hissed softly, nails digging into skin enough to cause a sting of pain, before pulling away. The facade of utmost professionalism and grace slips back over the woman's features when she turns from her daughter. </span></p><p><span>Agatha feels like she is being boiled alive with unquenchable rage, desperate to fire back at her mother with everything in her veins. Body tense and hand itching for a fight, the brunette slams the martini glass down onto the nearest table and pushes through the crowd. </span></p><p><span>Rio quickly tells the other bartender she is taking her fifteen minute break before following after the other woman. Just as Agatha is about to storm into the women's restroom, Rio catches her wrist with a light grip and pulls her away. The catcher is seconds from blowing up on the demanding hand around her wrist when she sees Rio, tugging her down the hallway. </span></p><p><span>“Rio-” Agatha tries to pull away, almost stopping in her tracks but the other woman stays strong. </span></p><p><span>“Trust me,” Rio says swiftly, leading them up a flight of stairs and into a deserted private bathroom. Agatha takes a deep breath and feels her rage settle only slightly but enough that she won't lash out. Not at the moment at least. </span></p><p><span>Rio's already gentle hand turns lighter as she brings the brunette's wrist up to her curious eyes. Even in the dim light she can see the painful looking marks in the catcher's skin. Knowing that Rio saw her and her mother, watched their fight, has anxiety, panic and vulnerability swirling in her stomach. </span></p><p><span>Agatha jerks her hand away just as soft fingers graze the half moon nail marks indented in her wrist. Their eyes meet and the brunette's stomach flips at the concern and anger she sees in brown eyes. </span></p><p><span>“I'm fine-”</span></p><p><span>“You're not fine,” Rio cuts her off quickly, not apologetic at all for the interruption. Agatha hates how easy it is for the woman to read her. She sighs, and raises an eyebrow, an expectant look in her eyes. </span></p><p><span>“What are you going to do about it?” Agatha raises the challenge. </span><em><span>Make me forget</span></em><span>, she thinks hopefully. Rio’s eyes switch from concerned and angry to intrigued and curious. Only a handful of seconds pass before the other woman is stepping closer, Agatha stepping back until they are once again in the familiar position they continue to find themselves in, her back pressed flush against the cold metal door of the bathroom and Rio’s heated body boxing her in. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn't speak, doesn't utter a single word as she brings her hands up to cradle the catcher's strong jaw in gentle hands, tilting her head up to bring their lips together. Agatha’s eyes had fluttered closed and her hands reached out to pull them against each other, fisting in the pitcher's white dress shirt. This feels so </span><em><span>right</span></em><span>. Agatha melts into the kiss, silently requesting more with her hands pulling the other woman closer. </span></p><p><span>Rios indulges, deepening the kiss with her tongue swiping at the bottom of Agatha’s lip in question. She smirks slightly at the brunette's soft moan as her lips part to grant her entrance. It isn't a fight for dominance like it was before. This time, Agatha wants the release Rio is giving her, she will take everything and still want more. Agatha's hands, having drifted up to wrap around steady shoulders, clutches at the back of the woman's neck and shoulder.</span></p><p><span>It doesn't take long for her hands to wander, knowing they are doing this on borrowed time. Rio drops her hands down to strong thighs and begins bunching up the black dress in fistfulls. When toned thighs are bare to her hands she grabs her hip with one hand, letting the material of the dress drape across her wrist. While her other hand slides along dampened panties. Rio moans at the feeling of wet lace under her finger tips, stroking purposefully. </span></p><p><span>Agatha gasps softly, hips bucking forward for more friction. Needing release more than air itself, her own hand meets the dark haired woman's hand between her thighs to gain more friction. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio's voice is husky with lust, her hand coated in arousal as she grinds her palm into the brunette's clit through the material of her thong, “Do you always get so fucking wet?” The pitcher's wicked mouth moves down to plant hot kisses against her neck. Agatha moans, dropping her head back against the door, giving the other woman more room to work, her hand sliding up into the loose hair at the nape of her neck.  </span></p><p><span>“Huh?” Rio prompts, noticing how the catcher keeps her forearm in a tight grip even when she slips her fingers inside of her thong to feel the wet heat without the barrier. </span></p><p><span>Agatha groans, biting her lip and pushing slender fingers further until two slip inside of her with ease. The moan it rips out of her is loud and uninhibited, swallowed up but the classical music from the party. </span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha admits a little reluctantly, shaking her head and breathing shakily when a dark chuckle reverberates against her neck. It sends heat straight down her spine. Rio groans, nails digging into bucking hips as her hand works harder, the sound of the other woman's arousal coating her fingers and palm deliciously. She brings their lips back together, kissing the breath out of each moan and gasp that she pulls from the other woman. </span></p><p><span>“You feel so good. </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, Agatha. I…” Rio whispers, moaning in awe when the velvet walls surrounding her thrusting fingers clamp around her. The desperate, hungry type of husk to the other woman’s voice has Agatha's heart pounding loudly in her chest, each beat a battle against the desperate plea that claws at her throat.</span></p><p><span>“I want to taste you,” Rio whispers into their kiss, grabbing soft thighs with purpose, fingers digging into flesh as she spreads her legs wider. Agatha’s next breath stutters on the intake of the air between them, eyes parting just enough to watch Rio drop to her knees. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Holy fucking shit</span></em><span>,” Agatha breathes out in shock, suddenly able to keep her eyes wide open to watch. It’s as if the fantasies in her head are determined to come to life. She has been eaten out before but it has been a </span><em><span>while</span></em><span>. Ralph didn't want to do it, made it out to be a chore, and it's not like he was good at it anyway so she certainly wasn't going to put herself through that just for the hell of it. </span></p><p><span>Rio smirks, yanking down the expensive panties the brunette is wearing, and pulling the flimsy material off of one ankle to hang loosely from the other.  </span></p><p><span>“Is that okay with you, </span><em><span>Captain</span></em><span>?” Rio pulls the woman’s thigh onto her shoulder, spreading her open and placing a kiss to her inner thigh, all while still thrusting her fingers. Agatha nods her head eagerly, momentarily mute, biting back a whimper. </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles and leans forward, swiping her tongue through sweet heat to find the brunette’s throbbing clit. Agatha takes in a sharp breath, her hands sliding into mussed hair to pull her in further. The moan that thrums across her clit has an echo of it ripping from her chest. </span></p><p><span>The pitcher groans deeply, immersing herself in the taste of the other woman, finding herself easily addicted and falling deeper into the rabbit hole that is Agatha Harkness. Not an inkling of regret or remorse plagues her mind, happy to dive in. Her nails dig into the soft flesh of the catcher’s ass to aid her movements and keep her stable while the woman grinds against her tongue. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Christ</span></em><span>, Rio,” Agatha moans, her eyes slipping closed despite the desire to watch the other woman work with her skilled, wicked tongue, “</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span> - fuck me, th-that’s good.” The brunette gasps out in between pleasurable moans, her head thumping back against the door. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s orgasm approaches quickly, crawling up her spine and making her back arch with the shock of it. Her fingers tug and twist in dark locks, only half guilty about ruining her hairdo before soft lips pull her mind back to the woman between her thighs. She’s going to come, arguably faster than the other night which was already pretty fucking fast for her. The knowledge that her release is going to crash down on her like a fucking tsunami makes her desperate for it. She wants to be ruined and she has already forgotten what she wanted to forget in the first place.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Soft and whiny just how Rio likes it. If she had it her way, the catcher would say her name like that and nothing else. The thigh muscles on her shoulder shake and the walls surrounding her fingers tremble. Playing the brunette like a fiddle, her fingers curl, beckoning the woman’s orgasm to the surface. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck- I’m gonna come. Rio - </span><em><span>oh, God</span></em><span>-” Agatha’s own moan cuts herself off. Rio hums pleased and tries to urge the woman to fall over the edge without pulling her mouth away, flicking her tongue as she sucks and holding on to the other woman with a tight grip. The catcher pulls the pitcher in, a sharp heel digging into her back as she shakes on thrusting fingers. Fingers curl inside of her, drawing out the orgasm that threatens to tear her apart. She slaps a hand over her own mouth to muffle the sounds of her climax. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is sure she is going to fall, holding onto the hair in her hand like a lifeline and leaning heavily into the door behind her. Her hips jerk and shake, confused between bucking for more or tearing herself away from the succubus of a woman kneeling in front of her. Her orgasm fades and she is still trying to catch her breath when devilish lips pull back and latch onto the sensitive skin of her thigh instead. </span></p><p><span>She gasps softly at nipping teeth and the dull throb of blood rushing to her skin, smiling lazily when she realizes Rio is leaving a mark. She pulls her head off the door to look down at the raven haired woman who seems content to stay on her knees and between her thighs. Agatha is tempted to go a second round especially when slick fingers pump shallowly inside of her and draw another quiet moan past her lips. The soft music past the door brings her back to reality.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha breathes out, her fingers combing lightly through dark hair and tugging slightly to pull the other woman's mouth away. Rio sighs softly, reluctantly pulling back to admire the dark bruise on the catcher's strong inner thigh with a smirk of satisfaction. </span></p><p><span>“I'm going to need my leg back.” The brunette teases, wiggling her high heel strapped foot. Rio chuckles softly, glancing up at the other woman with a stubborn look, pulling her fingers back regardless. With a steady hand she leads the other woman's foot back onto the ground, feeling more than smug when the muscles under her touch shake. </span></p><p><span>Rio rises from the ground with grace, wiping her lips with the back of her hand, and walks to the sink to wash her hands. Agatha struggles to maintain her balance even on her own two feet without the pitcher to keep her steady. She works her dress back down her legs, smoothing out the obvious wrinkles as best she can and drags her ruined thong back up her legs. </span></p><p><span>The catcher moves to stand behind the other woman to look in the mirror. Her lipstick is smudged around her lips with hints of red tracing the length of her neck where the other woman had mouthed at her with hot kisses. Her hair is a little unruly but the curls make it look natural. Other than that, she is well put together. She can't say the same for Rio. </span></p><p><span>The pitcher finishes wiping the lipstick from around her mouth, shooting the brunette a sly smile through the mirror, before focusing on her hair. </span></p><p><span>“You should get back out there,” Rio offers gently, turning around to lean back against the sink and let her hair down, “It's going to take me a second to fix your mess.” She smiles wider when pale cheeks turn pink. </span></p><p><span>Agatha </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> leave but her reluctance to return to the mob of stuffy people and her judgemental mother isn't exactly appealing. However, Rio looks very appealing. Especially with her hair down which she doesn’t get to see very often. She steps forward, running her fingers through dark hair and pushing it out of brown eyes. </span></p><p><span>Rio watches her closely, hands coming up to caress Agatha’s forearms to keep her close. Blue eyes flicker away from the intense eyes studying her to look at her hands combing dark unruly hair into smooth locks. Then to lips that are just begging to be kissed again. She has to pull away. </span></p><p><span>“You should leave it down more often,” Agatha whispers softly. Rio smiles softly, her ego taking a boost with the compliment. The brunette refuses to meet brown eyes, knowing a flush would take over her features with smugness she would find. </span></p><p><span>Agatha pulls back her shoulders and clears her throat, walking from the bathroom with every muscle in her body more relaxed than it was when she walked in. Rio smiles wider, turning back to the mirror and fixing her hair to look presentable without the bun keeping it back. She gets a little bit of an evil eye from the other bartender for coming back late but she sends it right back to him. </span></p><p><span>Agatha forces herself to ignore her mother’s jabs and avoid Wanda’s curious looks. She knows she is acting differently, relaxed but still professional. She can’t help it, Rio just </span><em><span>does</span></em><span> something to her. She cuts the strings that keep her spine so tight. So, when her mother calls for the car to come around she sends a longing look toward the pitcher who is already watching her leave. </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles, feeling her heart beat a little faster with the brunette’s attention. She helps clean up at the venue, taking home a good wad of cash and feeling the urge to keep her spirits high. Also, reluctant to return to her dorm that is sure to smell of weed and spilled cocktails by now. </span></p><p><em><span>10:48pm - Rio Vidal: Don’t tell me you’re done for the night.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha has to bite back a smile as soon as the text pops up on her phone. Not that it matters, both women have been studying her since she came back from the bathroom. Wanda nudges her foot and raises an eyebrow. </span></p><p><span>“Who’s got you smiling?” Wanda questions curiously. Agatha manages to keep the blush off of her cheeks and angles her phone away from both women. </span></p><p><span>“Randy, I hope.” Evanora mutters under her breath, her eyes sending a pointed look to her daughter before returning to furiously typing an email on her phone. Wanda’s brow furrows and she mouths ‘Randy’. Blue eyes roll. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Ralph</span></em><span> is asking about my night.” Agatha lies through her teeth and brings her phone back to her attention. Wanda chuckles, more questions obviously swirling in her mind but she won’t ask anything else in front of her mother. </span></p><p><em><span>10:50pm - Agatha Harkness: Maybe, maybe not. </span></em></p><p><em><span>10:51pm - Rio Vidal: Do you have roommates?</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha’s bottom lip catches between her teeth nervously. If Rio comes over, they need to do more than get swept up in each other. They need to talk about what they are and how to handle it. Once was a mistake, a slip up between lowered inhibitions and tension, but the second time, was deliberate. She thinks she is safe to assume they both want this, even if she won’t say it aloud. </span></p><p><em><span>10:58pm - Agatha Harkness: 300 Darkhold Lane, Westview, NJ 07660</span></em></p><p><em><span>10:58pm - Agatha Harkness: Midnight.</span></em></p><p><span>Rio smiles at the response, relief filling her chest with the breath that leaves her lungs. She was seconds away from chickening out and sending a follow up text to take back the question. She wondered if she had pushed too hard too soon. </span></p><p><em><span>10:59pm - Rio Vidal: Yes, Captain.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha rolls her eyes at the response but feels another smile attempting to take over her lips even through annoyance. She tucks her phone away and glances at Wanda, eyeing her suspiciously. She keeps her gaze for a few seconds before looking out the window. </span></p><p><span>On the return to her apartment, Evanora bids her daughter a distracted goodbye, still typing on her phone as she offers the redhead a ride to her apartment. Wanda takes her up on the offer but whispers into the brunette’s ear the request for the sordid details later. </span></p><p><span>An hour passes, Agatha busies herself with a quick shower and a distracted attempt to clean up the small apartment. Halfway through nervously cleaning the fucking microwave just to keep herself preoccupied, the doorbell rings. </span></p><p><span>Rio takes a deep breath, uncertain about what exactly she is doing at her softball captain’s apartment in the middle of the night. She had a singular focus in mind after the Gala that revolved around Agatha moaning and whimpering her name for many more hours, preferably completely naked. After the high of the night wore off, she started second guessing herself. </span></p><p><span>The door opens and neither woman knows what to say. Rio is stunned to silence from the brunette standing in front of her in a floral robe with damp hair flowing over her shoulders in soft waves. Agatha feels her mouth go dry at the sight of the raven-haired woman still dressed in the white button down from the Gala, sleeves rolled up to her elbows, but her hair is still down and flowing. Suddenly, she isn’t as concerned about talking. </span></p><p><span>“Come in,” Agatha takes a step back, letting the other woman step into the apartment. Rio’s eyes widened in surprise at the large apartment. Agatha shuts and locks the door, quickly pushing aside the cleaning supplies and putting a counter between herself and Rio who stands in the living room looking over the apartment. She needs alcohol. </span></p><p><span>“We need to talk.” Agatha begins strongly, grabbing one of her few bottles of hard liquor from the cabinet above her stove. Her options are limited to whiskey, rum and an empty bottle of vodka. Rio turns back around to see the brunette pouring two healthy glasses of whiskey. The brunette places one glass onto the breakfast bar and nudges it closer to the other woman, sipping from her own with a wince. </span><em><span>She needs more vodka.</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>Rio takes the glass and sips from the amber liquid. She knows she shouldn’t push but she can’t help herself. Getting under Agatha’s skin is her favorite pastime and she is wondering how quickly she can get that hot, angry flush on the catcher’s exposed chest. </span></p><p><span>“Whatever about, Captain?” Rio questions, a smirk gracing her lips as she takes another sip from her drink. The narrowing blue eyes make her chest warm. </span></p><p><span>“You know </span><em><span>what</span></em><span>,” Agatha grits out angrily, glaring at the raven-haired woman. The pitcher hums knowingly and swipes her glass from the counter and walks around to close the distance between them. Rio stops with a foot or two of distance between them. She tilts her head and takes a second to drag her eyes down the brunette’s lithe form. </span></p><p><span>Agatha suddenly remembers the very naked body she has covered by a very thin and short silk robe. It drives her mad how the calm, dark demeanored woman can send her into a downward spiral of lust and rage with a simple look. Heat flares between her thighs with those eyes watching her. </span></p><p><span>“I want to hear you say it.” Rio sips the whiskey, looking at the catcher over the top of the glass. Agatha’s jaw twitches with the tension she imposes with clenched teeth. The glare she is sporting deepens and the fingers around the glass tighten with white knuckles. </span></p><p><span>“Rio.” Her voice is stern and stubborn. Rio knows she is pushing too hard. What can she say? She likes to make the woman break. She drinks the rest of the whiskey and places the glass back on the counter. </span></p><p><span>“Maybe I should go.” Rio bluffs, turning to make her way towards the door. Agatha flounders for a second, chest tightening with panic and eyes widening with the woman’s sudden departure. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t.” Agatha bites out quickly, keeping her stubborn glare in place even as her voice wavers at the supposed demand that sounds far too panicked to actually hold any authority. The pitcher spins back around and moves closer, raising an eyebrow but knowing she shouldn’t push anymore than she already has. </span></p><p><span>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio begins softly but still sees the tension in strong shoulders and strives to release it, “You wanted to talk. So, talk.” Agatha takes another sip from her glass, then another, gathering the courage to actually speak. Maybe this was a bad idea. </span></p><p><span>“We need rules if we’re going to keep doing… </span><em><span>this</span></em><span>.” When the other woman smirks in amusement she definitely realizes it was a bad idea. She expects more taunting and teasing but the pitcher doles out mercy instead. </span></p><p><span>“Rules…” Rio drawls out, mulling the word over and keeping the catcher on the edge of her seat before continuing, “Okay, shoot.” She agrees, placing a steadying hand on the counter but drifting closer in the same movement. </span></p><p><span>Agatha has to force her brain to work, “No marks.”</span></p><p><span>“Ah, ah, ah,” Rio says quickly, moving closer until the brunette is backed into the corner of the counter, “No </span><em><span>visible</span></em><span> marks. Right? We’ve discussed that already.” The pitcher establishes their first rule quickly. Her eyes jumped down to the faded bruise on the base of the other woman’s throat then lower to her covered thighs where she placed a fresh hickey only a handful of hours ago.  </span></p><p><span>“No visible marks,” Agatha agrees, her breathing picking up as the other woman invades her space. She reaches back to grip the kitchen counter with both hands to keep herself grounded. Rio watches the silk robe part slightly with the spread of her shoulders, more skin of her chest being put on display. It drives her that much closer to saving this conversation for later. </span></p><p><span>“What else?” Rio prompts, placing her hands on the counter on either side of Agatha’s hips and leaning in. </span></p><p><span>“No one finds out. This stays between us.” Agatha says sternly, the one rule she certainly won’t waver on. Rio doesn’t hesitate to nod her agreement, raising an eyebrow expectantly. “We don’t do it anywhere we can get caught.” Rio chuckles in amusement, tilting her head with a mocking look on her face. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>It</span></em><span>?” Rio teases, blue eyes rolling, “Come on Agatha. You’re a big girl, use your words.” The pitcher’s voice turns sweet like honey with a sharp pinch of condescension, lurring the other woman into the game between them and sending heat down her spine. The brunette purses her lips, stubbornly keeping her mouth locked tight, and shifting back against the counter when the body in front of her moves closer. Rio licks her lips as she leans in to taunt the brunette. </span></p><p><span>“I've heard you say it before.” Rio urges casually, pressing their bodies together and effectively making the catcher's breath stutter. “When you're breathing hard and taking every inch of my fingers, you like saying </span><em><span>it</span></em><span> a lot.” She lets the words roll off her tongue slowly and pointedly. Watching blue eyes darken with every word. </span></p><p><span>Their thighs slide together. Agatha, feeling so deliciously cornered and hating that she loves it, tries to reign herself in. Even though Rio’s dirty words, suggestive eyes and close proximity is seconds from sending her over the edge. She raises her chin defiantly.</span></p><p><span>“No </span><em><span>fucking</span></em><span> anywhere we could get caught.” Agatha manages to make the word ‘fucking’ land with as much defiance as she intends but her voice loses its bravado as soon as strong hips roll into her. Her words end with a struggling breath. Rio groans softly, leaning in to kiss the brunette's cheek and nudging underneath her jaw to nip at the skin there. </span></p><p><span>“I love it when you talk dirty to me,” Rio husks, a teasing smile pressing into heated skin. Agatha groans partially in annoyance and partially because the other woman is driving her insane by being so close but not </span><em><span>actually</span></em><span> giving her anything to work with. She is struggling to keep her hips still but drops her head back onto her shoulders to give the devious mouth on her throat more access. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>God</span></em><span>, you are so annoying.” She easily keeps a sharp edge to her words that time around. Rio chuckles and brings her hands to grip her tense hips, lips trailing to her chest. </span></p><p><span>“Mmm, that's it. You really know how to turn a girl on.” Rio pulls them flush. Agatha sighs exhaustively, avoiding the zip of pleasure that runs through her system from the small praise, her fingers tangling in dark hair to tug back the smug woman from her neck. She tries to lean in to connect their lips and shut the infuriating woman up for at least a little while. Rio keeps her distance with a sly smile. </span></p><p><span>“Is that all?” Her fingers drift upwards to pull at the loose knot keeping the halves of the robe together, her eyes feasting on the uncovered skin as the silk parts, “Or can I fuck you now?” Rio mutters softly. Agatha pulls herself together, placing a stern hand on the pitcher's stomach to push her back and slip out from between the woman and the counter. She walks towards the bed, glancing over her shoulder and dropping the robe to pool on the ground in her wake. </span></p><p><span>“Yes, Rio, you can fuck me.” Agatha smirks and climbs onto the bed. Rio is quick to follow behind the brunette. </span></p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>They broke rule number three. </p><p>It's only been six days since they made the rules and they're fucking on the sink of the locker room.</p><p>“Fuck, I'm gonna come.” Agatha moans and arches her back, fingers tangling in Rio's hair and tugging her ever closer. The pitcher groans with the pain and digs her fingers into the back of the catcher’s thighs, keeping them spread and pushed back. It will leave bruises but the woman keeps wiggling and bucking underneath her despite her grip so she holds on tight.</p><p>“Show, don't tell,” Rio pants out hotly before resuming her hard working task, sucking and licking at her throbbing clit. Agatha places a hand over her mouth to muffle her climax as she shakes and bucks in orgasm. Her shoulders dig into the cold mirror behind her and her head falls back to thud against it. Rio moans quietly, slowing her tongue and pulling her mouth away as she watches the other woman come. </p><p>Rio's eyes catch sight of herself in the mirror. Lips and chin smothered in the brunette’s arousal, she can't get enough of her. The smug glint in her eyes only grew. Her tongue flicks out to swipe across her lips, collecting one last taste, before releasing the other woman's thighs to wipe off the rest of her mouth with the back of her hand. She stands up from her kneeling position on the cold, hard tile and keeps her body positioned between shaking thighs. </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha hissed, pushing up to sit and stretch out her neck. It has been a week since the Gala. Between Wanda badgering her for information about her new fuck buddy, her mother demanding she get back together with Ralph, and the team on a winning streak she is exhausted. Even still, Rio's mouth is the only thing to cure her lack of energy and motivation in times like this. Which means she broke her own rule and seduced the pitcher, not that it took much. They were always her rules, not Rio's. </p><p>That is why Agatha is pants less, her thong lost somewhere on the floor, with shaking legs sitting on the locker room sink counter with a very smug, satisfied Rio between her legs.</p><p>“Why didn't you use your fingers?” Agatha whispers, still catching her breath, tugging her T-shirt back into place and tightening her ponytail with bright red cheeks. It's a pointless and stupid question, she does want to know the answer because she loves the pitcher's fingers inside her, but she knows it will rile Rio up and that's really why she asks. Sure enough, brown eyes widen in disbelief.</p><p>“I was a little busy holding your squirming ass still.” Rio bites back, warm hands running up strong thighs to squeeze pointedly at her hips. Shivers and goosebumps rush across the skin under her hands. Agatha scoffs and reluctantly pushes her hands away, hoping off the counter with grace even though her legs are a little shaky.</p><p>“I thought you were good at multitasking?” Agatha taunts as she sends the raven haired woman a feigned look of confusion. She begins looking for her thong and leggings in the dim bathroom. Where the hell did her thong go? That shit was expensive. She should yell at Rio for being so careless. A hand grabs her wrist, tugging until she spins into the other woman's strong body with a gasp. </p><p>“You know there is one way I can have my hands free while I fuck you.” Rio’s voice is deep and her eyes dark, promising something with that mischievous glint in her eyes. Since she <em>just</em> had an orgasm, the needy desperate side of Agatha isn't so complacent to play into Rio's sassy and mysterious meaning. She bites back. </p><p>“Yeah, it's called <em>multitasking</em>.” Agatha says the word slowly, as if Rio can't comprehend the word otherwise. The dark haired woman laughs, fucking laughs right in her face, and shoves her back against the counter to box her in. Need and want swirl between her still drenched thighs as she looks up at the taller woman. The feeling of being trapped in the woman's snare makes her chest ache with excited anticipation. Agatha finds herself enjoying the feeling more and more every time she finds herself in this position. </p><p>“No, Ags,” Rio lets the nickname slip freely in private ever since she found that the accidental nickname turns Agatha bright red with rage so she makes it a habit, earning a glare “- well, that is part of it -” She thinks aloud with another prideful smile, “but no, I'm talking about a <em>strap on</em>.” Turnabout is fair play and Rio draws out the words for the brunette to comprehend slowly. </p><p>Except she actually needs the slow address. Agatha’s brow furrows before her brain lands on an image of her imagination, and now fantasy, of Rio dressed in her normal panties and sports bra but with a harness and dark green dildo jutting from between her thighs. <em>Fuck</em>. A hand comes up to grip her jaw and forces her to look up at brown eyes. </p><p>“Does that sound good to you?” Rio is smirking knowingly and pinning Agatha with such an intensely sinful look. As if she is thinking of all the dirty, nasty things she plans to do to the brunette and is trying her hardest to communicate that to Agatha with her eyes alone. </p><p>Agatha is struggling to fight back the urge to convince the other woman to bend her over the counter to take her fingers. The need to be filled by Rio in one way or another is a feeling she still hasn't become accustomed to. It catches her off guard most of the time but she knows what she wants and it <em>does </em>sound good. Too many delicious ideas and thoughts fly through her mind to land on one in particular. They'll need a lot of free time to explore this. The catcher parts her lips, thinking of a retort that doesn't sound absurdly pathetic and desperate, but she doesn't get the chance. </p><p>Lights from the front locker room begin to flicker on and the jarring loud voices of the team cut the lust filled tension between them with a butcher knife. Agatha scrambles for her clothes and Rio swiftly smoothes down her unruly hair. </p><p>“Where the fuck is my thong?” Agatha hisses, shooting Rio with a harsh glare. She shrugs and smiles and spins on her heel to walk back towards the lockers. The catcher gawks at her lack of concern but then again it is such a <em>Rio</em> move to leave her struggling to gather herself. Reluctant, Agatha forgets the thong and tugs her leggings into place with a grimace. She is <em>wet</em>. An orgasm and Rio’s dirty promises will do that to a woman. This will be the most uncomfortable practice of her life. She sighs and walks out to her locker. </p><p>The women don't even notice her arrival, just smiling and waving as if she walked in with them. Rio has her foot up on the bench, lacing up her cleats, with a perfectly normal smile if it weren't for her eyes staring directly at Agatha with mischief. Blue eyes roll and she grabs her own cleats to pull on. </p><p>Rio chuckles softly to herself and finishes getting dressed, ready to head out onto the field with the rest of the team when her phone rings. Agatha looks over at the raven haired woman who answers the phone, leaving the locker room as quickly as she answered the call. Agatha’s brow furrows with curiosity gnawing at her. </p><p>“Do you think that was a booty call?” Wanda whispers as they begin the walk out to the fields. Blue eyes immediately search for the second string pitcher, huddled by the dugout with her back toward the field talking on the phone in a hushed tone. </p><p>Jen pipes up from behind them, “I heard she's a <em>demon</em> in the sack.” The first baseman's presence, and investigative nature, scared the shit out of Agatha. The brunette jumps at her input and glances over her shoulder to see Jen and Alice approaching them. She forces her features to stay calm and neutral. She doesn't want to give away the fact that she <em>knows</em> Rio is a <em>‘demon in the sack’</em>. Whatever that means.</p><p>“<em>Really?</em>” Wanda’s eyes are wide in surprise but her voice is filled with curiosity and intrigue. Unintentionally dragging Agatha into the realm of jealousy she has never been in before. The feeling brews a mix of hot and cold right behind her sternum.</p><p>“You have a boyfriend, Wanda - <em>Vision</em>, remember him?” Agatha reminds the redhead, plopping down on the grass to begin stretching, eyes flickering back toward the raven haired woman still speaking on the phone. Much to her disappointment, possibly her fault, the three women sit down beside her to stretch and continue their conversation. </p><p>“Vis and I have been together since freshman year of high school. He's amazing and I love him - a lot! It's just, ya know, a woman can be…curious.” Wanda defends quickly, a flush settling over her cheeks as she speaks and avoids eye contact at all costs. Agatha blinks in shock. Her very straight and head over heels in love best friend is talking about sleeping with a <em>woman</em>. Not just any woman but possibly, <em>Rio</em>. </p><p>“Yeah, Agatha, aren't you curious?” Jen toys with them both so easily. The brunette pins the woman with a glare but she isn't deterred. “A woman with a reputation as good as Rio’s doesn't make you wonder what it would be like to fuck a woman?” The catcher ducks her face out of sight, leaning into the stretch of her hamstring, face down and away from Jennifer's taunting face.</p><p>“I've heard she does all the fucking,” Alice adds very unhelpful and daring the flush to rise to her skin. She has been on the receiving end of Rio’s very generous, albeit annoying, nature. She was on the other end of it only a handful of minutes ago. Suddenly remembering the wetness and ache between her thighs. It's nice out today, a cool breeze washes over them, Agatha won't be able to excuse her red cheeks. </p><p>“Even better. Rio is the perfect opportunity to explore sex with a woman without <em>actually</em> having sex with a woman.” Jen smirks knowing that she is beginning to piss the brunette off and turn the pitcher neon with their crude language. Agatha’s jaw muscles tense with the clench of her teeth. That can't be accurate, can it? Agatha hasn't really touched her-touched her but she touches her. That makes sense. She has sex with Rio…right? </p><p>“Maybe don't sexualize the newest team member? That way we can all stay off of Herb’s shit list for starting rumors and scandals.” Agatha bites back quickly, her eyes jumping back to Rio who has a genuine smile on her face now that she is almost facing the field again. She hates how much she hates to not be the reason for that type of smile. She gets plenty of smiles from the pitcher, dirty and knowing,  but very rarely does she get a smile as genuine as that. So, who the fuck is? It makes her jealousy mix with rage and the icy hot swirl in her chest turns into a roaring inferno. </p><p>“Touchy, touchy, Harkness. Does someone have a crush?” Jen teases. Agatha whips around with an insult on the tip of her tongue when Herb and Sharon call the team together at home base. </p><p>“Come on, girls! Huddle up!” Sharon's voice rings out in a high shrill. Jen keeps their gaze until Alice nudges the first baseman up from the ground, Wanda doing the same for Agatha. Jen <em>knows</em> without actually <em>knowing</em>.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“Harkness, get Vidal's ass over here.” Herb says tiredly, gesturing towards the pitcher still talking on the phone, completely oblivious to the team gathering. Agatha sighs and shoots the first baseman a glare when she hears her mumbling under her breath about Vidal’s ass. Jen smiles sweetly and waves kindly as if she isn't talking shit. It annoys Agatha to no end. She stalks closer and closer to Rio. </p><p>"...<em>Sí, abuela, estoy comiendo bien. No te preocupes. Te visitaré pronto, lo prometo</em>..." <em>Yes, Grandma, I'm eating well. Don't worry. I'll visit you soon, I promise.</em></p><p>Agatha's steps stutter at the foreign tongue escaping the other woman's mouth. Rio turns when she approaches, eyebrows raising in question as her eyes flicker back towards the team gathered at home plate. </p><p>“We're getting ready,” Agatha utters softly and nods her head back towards the group, keeping her eyes on the other woman. </p><p>"<em>Tengo que irme. Hablaré contigo mañana, abuela. Te quiero</em>." <em>I have to go. I'll talk to you tomorrow, Grandma. I love you.</em> Rio mutters quickly, promising her grandma that she will call tomorrow, noticing how blue eyes swirl with awe and something else. It intrigues her. She hangs up the phone and falls into step with the catcher as they walk to home plate. </p><p>“I didn't know you spoke Spanish.” Agatha mutters, searching for information without pushing. Of course the other woman notices and makes the best of that fact. </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio answers shortly, a small smile crossing her features when the brunette bristles at the lack of information. They reach the group and Herb starts off the practice with a smile. </p><p>“Today we will be assessing everyone and having fun.” Agatha knows what that means, her lips already turning up in a smirk and glances at Wanda to see her smiling as well. “Scrimmage, just enough to tweak anything that needs tweaking. Alright?” The team cheers and Herb lets them split off into smaller teams with just infield players. Wanda and Agatha start off on the field and Rio is the first up to bat. </p><p>“Hey Agatha,” Rio begins tauntingly, “I was wondering something earlier.” She knows it is just them at home plate, Herb having taken to the pitcher's mound to coach the redhead. Agatha stays silent because she knows talking to any batter, especially Rio, is asking for trouble. The raven-haired woman is determined to get a rise out of her captain and unfortunately for the catcher, she has gotten pretty damn good at it. </p><p>“How many orgasms do you think you could have?” The question catches the brunette completely off guard, the ball landing in her mitt with a last minute move to the right. Her widened eyes glance around them, relieved to find just her and Rio near home base. That fact does little to quell the disbelief and anger at the woman daring to speak so boldly about the arrangement they have. Agatha stands to launch the ball back to Wanda who studies the two players curiously before focusing back on the Coach's recommendations. </p><p>“<em>Shut up</em>.” Agatha hisses under her breath before situating herself back behind home plate. Rio smirks, pleased to pull a reaction from the woman, and ready her stance once more. </p><p>“No one can hear us Ags.” The pitcher taunts, the catcher groans in annoyance at the nickname, “It's a genuine question - how many orgasms do you think you could even <em>take</em>?” The woman muses thoughtfully, shaking her head in uncertainty. Agatha can't decide if she should be offended or annoyed that the other woman thinks she wouldn't be able to take more than one. </p><p>Rio herself has forced two orgasms out of her the first time they were together. That thought is incredibly uncomfortable, making her shift in her stance to relieve the ache between her thighs. Her arousal feels ten times more noticeable without a barrier between her wetness and leggings. She really wishes she had found her thong. </p><p>“I know I've managed to get you to two orgasms but I'm not sure you can take three.” Rio hums in contemplation, sending dirty thoughts right to the brunette’s lustful mind. She had an orgasm like twenty minutes ago, what is wrong with her? It's as if there is a little devil on her shoulder telling her to let Rio fuck her to three orgasms right on top of home base.</p><p>The crack of the ball meeting metal rips her out of her daydream. Agatha huffs her annoyance as the ball flies over second base just out of Alice's reach in a perfect hit. Herb praises the newcomer on the hit, making the pitcher and catcher bristle for very different reasons. Rio sends the catcher a wink when she settles at first base and focuses her tactics of distraction on the first baseman. </p><p>By the time the raven haired woman makes it to home base for her team's first score she has sufficiently pissed off the entire in field. Even Dottie, who can barely muster a dirty look for a runner who literally runs her over, has the newcomer taking the blast of the meanest glare Agatha has ever seen the blonde give. </p><p>Three outs later and the secondary team takes their turn on the field. Rio and Darcy take a few pitches to warm up. The satisfying slap of the ball landing perfectly in the mitt every pitch makes Agatha wish she was on the receiving end of it. Her palm tingles with the itch. </p><p>Rio, having little field time in their last handful of games, refuses to hold back. She shows the coaches everything she's got. She strikes out two very angry players before Agatha steps up to bat. </p><p>Rio smirks when blue eyes narrow in on her, taking the call of a curveball from Darcy with a nod. The ball whips through the air and lands in the catcher's mitt with a solid thud. Just like the others, Agatha is victim to the pitcher’s taunting and she huffs in annoyance, but squares back up to the base for the second pitch. The fastball call from her catcher makes her smirk, Darcy must have a taunting streak in her as well, accepting the pitch with another nod. </p><p>However, while watching from the sidelines, the brunette had pulled together a plan of distraction. Agatha tugs at her shirt until an inch or two of skin is visible at her waist. An intrigued brow raises from the pitcher’s mound and dark eyes wander. It sends a flush of very distracting pleasure down her spine but she focuses on the task at hand. She readies herself in the batter’s box and waits until the woman is seconds away from releasing the ball to put the final touch. </p><p>Agatha arches her back and shakes her ass, the small movement drags dark eyes out of focus. The pitch leaves the woman's fingers a hair too slow and Agatha sends her bat swinging to meet it for a hit that sends the ball deep into the outfield. </p><p>Rio shakes her head and watches the brunette run to first base with a pleased smirk. She is already thinking of different ways to get her revenge for the sneaky distraction. A lot of those ideas include making the brunette beg, an act she seems so reluctant to do. Agatha sends a proud smirk back to the pitcher. </p><p>The rest of the scrimmage continues as such. The secondary team taunting and teasing, catching up to the first string team the more they mess with them, the last inning is hard fought for both sides. The score is tied. Wanda is up to bat and Agatha waits on third base to rush home. The rest of the team cheers from the dugout. Wanda already has two strikes under her belt, two outs for the inning, one more and the second string team wins. </p><p>Rio is on a hot streak. After Agatha, who continues to easily distract the pitcher, she struck out Jen and Alice one right after another. Wanda was going to be a piece of cake - <em>was.</em></p><p>“Bring me home baby!” Agatha calls out to the redhead, smirking when dark eyes narrow dangerously in her direction. She wonders how quickly Rio will try to fuck the smirk from her lips once practice is over. She hopes soon. The fire between her thighs has been at a steady blaze for the last few hours. </p><p>Rio takes a breath and locks in. Her gut twinges with jealousy but she bites her tongue. </p><p>“Come on, Wanda, bring me home.” Agatha says a little softer, teasing the pitcher just as she sends the ball flying. Wanda manages to crack the ball into right field and sets off for first base, touching the bag seconds before the first baseman catches the ball. </p><p>Agatha is already halfway to home when the ball flies to third to get the tag. Rio drops forward with her glove out to grab the third baseman's ball out of the air. She dives for the tag just as Agatha slides onto her side to touch the base. Glove meets shoulder and Herb calls the out. Rio smirks at Agatha who fumes with the loss. </p><p>Sharon, always positive, gathers the girls to give a far too long pep talk. Soon enough practice is over and everyone is dragging their bags back toward the locker room. Rio is the first to undress, yanking her shirt off and tossing it into her bag. Agatha finds herself staring a little too long at the nail marks she raked down Rio’s back while they fought for dominance in the locker room earlier. </p><p>“Damn, Rio.” Alice wolf whistles as she enters the locker room, pulling attention to the raven-haired woman with an impressive look of both her skills and her body. “You've got a hot arm out there.” Alice compliments, more so stoking the fire of Wanda’s hatred towards the second string pitcher who is obviously just as good as her if not better. Sure enough, Wanda narrows her eyes on the second baseman. </p><p>“I hit off her just fine. I can't say the same for you.” Wanda smirks at the bird Alice sends her way. </p><p>“Is that why I struck you out the other two times you were up to bat?” Rio questions curiously, feigning innocence as she steps up to the redhead. Wanda huffs, a glint of excitement shining in her eyes. The sudden shift in the air puts Agatha on edge and she watches the two women square off to each other. </p><p>“Just because you struck me out doesn't mean you're ready to leave the bench.” Wanda hisses, eyes narrowing dangerously. Rio smiles and releases a small chuckle, playing with the redhead like she was born to do it. </p><p>“But it was so…<em>easy</em>.” Rio tilts her head slightly, crossing her arms over her chest with a shit eating grin on her face. A few of the other teammates chuckle at the diss. Wanda’s lips turn up into a near snarl. </p><p>“Watch it, Vidal.” Wanda warns, stepping closer. Rio matches the move, only a few inches from the redhead and loving every second. </p><p>“Or what?” Rio whispers, her sly smile deepening. She raises an eyebrow when Wanda doesn’t respond, only getting angrier with balled up fists at her side. Agatha sighs as soon as she sees Wanda’s eyes nearly change red with rage. </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha warns shortly, pinning the woman with a glare. The dark haired woman takes another few seconds to keep the redhead's fiery gaze before backing away with an innocent look toward her captain. Blue eyes roll at the act before landing back on Wanda who slams her locker shut and tugs her bag onto her shoulder, storming from the locker room with a glare. The last thing Agatha needs before their game tomorrow is a pissed off pitcher.</p><p>“<em>Nice</em>,” Agatha hisses under her breath when she comes to open her locker. </p><p>“Was it something I said?” Rio teases easily. Agatha groans, ready to slam her own locker and leave. </p><p>“Whose thong is this?” Jen questions, holding up a silky deep purple La Perla thong with the smallest section of her nail that she can manage. </p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops in shock. <em>Of course</em>. Of course, Jen, of all people, found her torn off, drenched in arousal, quickie with Rio, thong. Her mouth goes dry and her tongue lays petrified in her mouth. What is she supposed to say? <em>Oh, sorry she left that behind while getting eaten out within an inch of her life. </em>Nothing that would make sense comes to mind and anxiety crawls up her throat to weigh down on her tongue. </p><p>Rio notices and jumps in before she can think it over, “Oh, those must be mine. I knew I lost them somewhere around here.” She takes a few steps forward and snatches the thong from Jen's fingers, the first baseman eyeing her suspiciously. Agatha takes a small breath and turns back towards her locker, sending the other woman a small glance with grateful eyes. </p><p>Rio sends her a sly wink and pointedly places the thong into her bag. Where she doesn't see the concern Agatha had if she claimed the thong as her own, she was happy to step in to save the woman from any internal dilemma she was struggling with. Also, she gets to take the brunette's thong home so it's a win-win scenario in Rio's mind. </p><p>“Jesus Rio,” Lila gasps as she steps closer to the pitcher, admiring the parallel scratches down the woman's back. Rio cranes her neck and catches sight of a few scratches. <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>“Are you fucking <em>kittens</em> or <em>cougars</em>?” Jen teases quickly. Rio laughs and shakes her head, pulling on her shirt. </p><p>“Only a few kittens.” Rio responds flirtatiously. Agatha rolls her eyes and deep down hopes that is not the case. She doesn't share. Despite her strong dislike for the infuriating woman, she hates the thought of another woman sleeping with Rio, not while she is.</p><p>“So, the rumors are true?” Alice questions curiously, earning a confused look from the other woman, “You have a reputation - a good one, but a reputation for…<em>you know</em>.” Alice gets a little shy, her cheeks flaming red at her own implications. It makes Rio smile to see her so flustered. She is well aware of her reputation. Even though she hasn't been holding up to that reputation since the night of the Gala. Her focus has been solely on Agatha and Agatha alone. </p><p>“I can neither confirm nor deny,” Rio responds smoothly and tugs her shirt back on. Jen and Alice call her out for more information but she is already leaving the locker room with a satisfied smile. </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath and leaves the locker room, walking out to spot Wanda and Vision talking not too far away. Wanda looks pissed, surely venting her frustrations about Rio, and Vision is being the calm, dutiful, and loyal boyfriend, nodding his head and listening intently. </p><p>“Hey stranger.” Agatha jumps at Ralph’s voice, spinning to find him leaning casually against the brick wall, giving her an amused smile. She can’t help the flare of annoyance in her chest at the sudden scare. </p><p>“Lurk much?” Agatha fires back aggressively. Ralph looks a little taken aback but pushes off the wall with a wider smile regardless. </p><p>“I’ve missed you.” Ralph inches closer, reaching out to take Agatha’s hand in his own, squeezing gently. His words, his touch, make Agatha want to crawl out of her skin. But, for appearances sake, she forces herself to relax and keep her face neutral. Her mother would be proud. </p><p>“Of course you did.” Agatha replies cool and calm, “No one measures up to me. Certainly not a pack of naive, desperate freshmen.” The words land with a sting as Ralph frowns before he quickly corrects himself to smile a little harder, covering up his bruised ego. </p><p>“No one comes close to you, Agatha.” Ralph agrees readily, moving closer so his hand can jump from her wrist to her hip. <em>Ugh</em>. That’s new, disgust <em>and</em> nausea. More importantly, <em>he’s not Rio</em>. She steps back, putting distance between them and crossing her arms to hopefully prevent him from touching her again. </p><p>“What do you want, Ralph?” She urges him to get to the point of this impromptu meeting. His normal, happy persona deflates slightly in defeat. </p><p>“I want to get back together.” Ralph says softly, almost pleading, sounding entirely too pathetic for Agatha to feel anything more than revulsion. She’s sure he came here with the intention of luring her back into their relationship that Agatha simply can’t justify anymore. Even if she wasn’t getting exactly what she needed from Rio, she  has no feelings for the man.</p><p>“And I don’t.” Agatha fires back quickly, making an effort to end the conversation by spinning on her heels and heading for the parking lot. Ralph follows her, because of course he does. She distantly remembers Jen talking about Ralph resembling a golden retriever and sees how apt the comparison is. Wanda and Vision watch them go, Agatha holding her head high. </p><p>“Agatha, hold on - wait, what did I do wrong? Tell me how I can fix this.” <em>Pathetic</em>. The man’s voice is filled with panic, the realization that Agatha won’t be giving their on-again-off-again relationship another flip of the switch dawning on him with dread. </p><p>“I’m done, Ralph. Don’t grovel, it’s not a good look.” Agatha wrinkles her nose with distaste, tossing her gear into the back of her Bronco. Ralph flounders like a damn fish, jaw dropping slightly in shock before it snaps closed, settling on anger.</p><p>“Was it someone else? Is that it? Did you cheat on me?” Ralph accuses swiftly, switching from begging to anger very quickly, attempting to find any reason besides himself to be the reason for their failed relationship. Agatha rolls her eyes, wondering if his little brain could even handle the knowledge of how Rio literally blows her mind with every touch, before deciding not to justify the question with an answer. Instead, she levels him with an unimpressed glare and hops into the driver’s seat. Agatha drives away, leaving Ralph stewing in anger in the parking lot, not looking back. </p>

      Chapter 9: Chapter 9: Jealousy is Green
  </h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha and Rio come to new terms with a lot of enthusiasm.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Agatha knows she doesn't have to get her thong back from the pitcher. But a few things are bothering her. Is Rio seeing other women? Who was she talking to on the phone earlier? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>That is how Agatha finds herself outside of Rio's dorm room in the middle of the night. She knocks hesitantly then a little harder when a group of men pass her in the hallway with too many wandering eyes. </span><em><span>Fucking dorms</span></em><span>. She is so glad her mother refused to let her live at the dorms even in her first year. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio opens the door, eyes widening in surprise at the sight of Agatha Harkness looking very uncomfortable and out of place in the dorm hallway. She leans against the doorway with crossed arms over her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness at my door. What a pleasure,” Rio draws seductively. Agatha sighs, already annoyed and horny, because why does the other woman look so damn good in sweatpants and a t-shirt? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm here for my thong.” Agatha responds dryly, raising an eyebrow in expectation. Rio's smile widens and she nudges the door open further in invitation as she turns to grab her bag. Agatha walks inside and shuts the door behind her. She looks around the room. She is not surprised to find purple grow lamps with flourishing plants under their light, dark decor and low light illuminating physic and botany scattered textbooks and worksheets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pulls the thong from her bag and lets the flimsy garment hang loosely from her fingertip when she turns towards the brunette. Agatha tries to reach for the thong only for it to be jerked from her reach. She pins the raven haired woman with an exhausted and deadly look. Rio smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> you're here for?” The taller woman tilts her head slightly, pulling both arms behind her back to keep the thong out of reach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha lets out scoff, “I'm </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> sorry I'm not one of your little freshmen sluts tripping over my feet to jump into your bed.” The brunette bites out easily, jealousy making the words sound harsh. The other woman seems surprised by her words but not the sharpness of them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that right?” Rio dangles the bait, luring her into an outburst that has been brewing in her chest since practice, and Agatha eats it up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That </span><em><span>kitten</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>cougar</span></em><span> shit was a little juvenile, don't you think?” The catcher hisses, disdain and disgust laced in her voice. “It is revolting. I mean, should I be concerned? How many women do you have wrapped around your finger?” The words fall past her lips with venom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio finally understands where this night is heading and can't decide if she should stoke the fire or not. Sure, she used to get around but not since Agatha started to infiltrate every last lustful thought in her head. She weighs out the pros and cons of the plan in her head and decides she can handle her outburst. She </span><em><span>wants</span></em><span> to handle it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, I see. You're jealous.” Rio says calmly, nonchalant with a shrug of her shoulders. Agatha boils with the insinuation. She steps closer, breathing Rio in and wanting so badly to reach out and touch her but her hands ball into fists at her sides. She doesn't want to give in that easily, a fight climbing up her spine thirsty for the rough push and pull they have perfected into a craft between them. Especially since Rio looks so god damn smug. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Please</span></em><span>,” Agatha spits indignantly, “What could I possibly be jealous of?” She questions in disbelief, daring the pitcher to point it out. She is jealous. She is so fucking jealous. Rio inches closer and her eyes drop to pretty, pump lips tightened with anger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have a feeling you don't like to share your toys.” Rio smirks and she sees a flash of desire and excitement in blue eyes. Agatha’s jaw clenches and her eyes narrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My </span><em><span>toys</span></em><span>?” The woman grits out. Rio tosses the thong back toward her bag, reaching out to take the brunette's hand when she reaches for them. Agatha grunts in frustration, pulls weakly at the grasp, but doesn't break free like they both know she could. The move pulls her closer instead. Rio pulls her closer still, hips brushing one another, and dips her head to place a soft kiss on the catcher's lips. It catches the brunette off guard.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't like sharing either.” Rio whispers truthfully, using her other hand to cup her sharp jaw and kiss her again. Agatha feels the butterflies in her chest flutter harshly against her ribcage. </span><em><span>No sharing</span></em><span>. At least they're on the same page with that. She leans in to chase soft lips, melting into the kiss and dropping her bag to wrap her arms around strong shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio smiles into the kiss, relieved not to get any rejection of their loosely agreed upon exclusivity. Her arms drop, one hand wrapping around a tight waist and the other gripping the back of the catcher's strong thigh. A simple shift in weight and brute strength brings Agatha up into her arms with a soft gasp of surprise. Tense thighs wrap around her hips and parted lips tear from her own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't fucking drop me,” Agatha hisses, nails digging into muscle as she is carried further into the room. Rio chuckles and drops the woman onto the bed. The brunette yelps and bounces with the drop. A glare is quick to burn a hole through the pitcher's head.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oops,” Rio taunts with a satisfied smile, “Are you going to smack me again?” Agatha gasps at the reference to their first drunken make out, eyes flashing dangerously. Gentle hands slide down her thighs and hook into her leggings to jerk down the material. Her shoes clatter to the floor with her leggings.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I really fucking should,” Agatha hisses truthfully, remembering the way the slap shocked them both, ripping off her shirt and grabbing the taller woman's shirt in her fist to yank her closer. Their lips connect in a much rougher kiss than before. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio barely catches herself with two hands on the bed to keep herself from falling completely on top of the woman. Shifting slightly her hands come up to grip her hips, retaliating with the pull of her body to the edge of the bed. Her hands wander, gripping and caressing every inch of soft, warm skin she can get her hands on. She pulls back, ready to kneel and dive between the thighs she would live in between if she could. Except Agatha’s hand won't leave the back of her neck. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wanna-” They both stop but Rio raises an eyebrow in surprise. That's the first time those words have come out so quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What's that?” Rio smirks a little wider when the other woman groans in frustration. The hand at the back of her neck leaves but she stays close. Her thumbs rub the smooth skin beneath her fingers while watching the woman below her flush. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just fuck me, Rio.” Agatha reaches behind her back to pop the clasp on her purple bra and fling it aside. The courage she had to speak her desire is gone and her hope to distract the woman from her compliance is rising quickly. Relief fills her when the woman becomes distracted with the newly exposed skin. Rio wets her lips and happily takes the offering, her mouth encasing her nipple with a soft moan. She takes her time, keeping her loose grip on twitching hips, as her mouth explores every inch of the brunette's chest like it was the first time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is panting and squirming and biting her tongue to stop pathetic words from slipping past her lips. Her brand new thong is completely drenched. The other woman would know that if she ever touched her. Unfortunately, those skilled hands haven't been any lower than her hips. She's going to explode. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha means to make it sound like a stern demand but instead she sounds breathless. Rio’s hot, kiss swollen lips leave her nipple with a knee shaking suck and audible pop from her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You want…” Rio trails off, hoping she has the other woman desperate enough to finish her sentence, Agatha stays stubbornly silent, “What exactly?” She finishes smoothly, leaning back and dragging her hands up over expanding ribs to use rough hands on her breasts. Agatha groans and digs her teeth into her bottom lip. A noise of surprise leaves her mouth beside her moan when deft fingers pinch her nipples in unison. Her back arches and her hands fist in the sheets below her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck me,</span></em><span>” Agatha groans, spreading her legs in invitation. Taking it a step further she wraps her legs around solid hips and pulls. Rio’s hips collide with the back of her thighs, the pressure she feels from the move has another moan leaking past her lips and her cunt to clench. She wants the strap on the other woman was talking about. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha can picture it in her head, thrusting hips and rough wandering hands while whispering dirty, nasty things if that wicked mouth isn't filled with her tits or tongue. She squeezes her thighs together for relief only to be disappointed by squeezing the pitcher's ribs instead. At this point, she'll settle for her fingers. </span><em><span>Anything</span></em><span> but nothing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels the desperation from the other woman as her thighs tense and squeezing at her sides. A quick glance down tells her all she needs to know. Even in the dim light she can see the wetness from Agatha’s clothed cunt leaving a very telling mark on her grey sweatpants. She is going to need a shit ton of restraint to stay in line with her plan to make the brunette beg. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Damn,” Rio whispers, dropping her hand down between them to tease the pad of her thumb over the wet, now dark purple, lace, “You do want </span><em><span>something</span></em><span>.” She taunts, rubbing a little harder to watch the brunette buck for more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha huffs, “Fuck you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio chuckles and pulls her hand away, enjoying the groan she gets in return. She slips her fingers into the waistband of the woman's panties and pulls them off, stepping back to admire the view. Her hands keep her thighs spread and open. She remembers the first time she had the catcher spread out before her and feels the same pull of desire to ruin her now as she did then. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you just going to stare or are you going to do something?” Agatha breathes out and pushes up onto her elbows with a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm going to do a lot of things,” Rio promises swiftly and keeps their eyes locked as she kneels between the catcher’s thighs for the second time today, “</span><em><span>But</span></em><span> I'm going to take my sweet time and see how quickly I can make you beg.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>I don't beg.</span></em><span>” Rio finishes with a smirk, slotting thighs over her shoulders and wrapping her arms around them. Agatha bristles with the sassy remark but gets easily distracted. Rio starts off planting kisses along her inner thighs, nipping and sucking to create marks and holding her hips to keep her from squirming away. Agatha glares harshly, tugging her closer with the heel of her foot digging into her back. As strong as Agatha is, Rio doesn't cave and decides if she is going to be tugged in she is going to make the woman regret it. The darker haired woman sucks harshly at the brunette's clit in retaliation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>!” Agatha gasps, one hand flying to the head of hair between her thighs and fists hard. Half of her wants more, relieved and pleased to finally feel anything, especially her mouth. Half of her wants to yank her away and drag her back up and force her fingers inside of her. Or maybe tell her to get the strap on. Her hips jump with the attention and her cunt clenches around nothing, silently begging to be filled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More,” Agatha moans, grinding into the tongue lapping at her clit. Rio groans softly at the pain pricking at her scalp. One hand comes back around to tease her drenched folds with two fingers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So impatient,” Rio mumbles hotly against slick folds and slides two fingers inside the catcher. A moan slips past her lips at the feeling of heat wrapping around her fingers. The echo of her own moan sounds above her head and she smirks as her fingers get to work. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha curses and moans, bucking harder until she is fucking herself on a wicked tongue and diligent fingers. She is coming close but it isn't what she wants. It isn't what she needs. She pulls on the hair tangled in her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I want more.” Agatha pants out between moans, trying so hard to convey what she wants with her eyes. Not that the other woman would be satisfied with that. Rio wants words. She wants to hear how desperate Agatha is for her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More…tongue, sucking, fingers?” Rio husks, eyes narrowing when none of those words seem to light a fire in the woman, no clenching around her fingers like she expected. Interesting. Her fingers still pump inside the brunette, drawing out moan after moan while she waits patiently. Agatha flutters around her fingers and fists the comforter at her sides instead of raven hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I want,” The words fight to stay in her mouth but Rio is as patient as ever, pulling her closer and closer to the edge while she waits, “I want to use the strap on.” The admission leaves her lips in a rush of air, a moan following closely behind when the fingers inside of her curl just right. Pleasure rushes down her spine and suddenly she is teetering on the edge.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That wasn't so hard, was it?” Rio smiles and thrusts a little harder. The request surprised her, mainly because they haven't really talked it over, but also because she is the woman's first female lover. Adding toys into the mix can be a big step for anyone. She is proud of the brunette because she knows she struggles with asking for what she wants. That doesn't mean she's not going to tease her about it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe you want to come on my fingers too, hmm?” She presses further. Agatha groans in frustration.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha growls, her hand coming back to tangle in raven hair and yank, hard. The deep grunting moan that it pulls from the woman forces her that much closer over the edge. The sound is so </span><em><span>animalistic.</span></em><span> Her eyes flick down to watch the dark, haze of lust fall over Rio's dark eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio fights the grip in her hair to latch her lips back onto her clit and suck, bringing the woman over the edge in seconds. She uses her free hand to strongly grab her bucking hips, hoping there will be bruises left behind, and fucks the woman through her orgasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh God</span></em><span> - motherfuck-” Agatha gasps in pleasure, both hand fisting and pulling dark hair to ride out her orgasm. Her thighs shake and clamp around the woman's head. Her eyes slam shut with bursts of white flashing behind her eyelids. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels her hand cramping up but refuses to stop, curling her fingers harder. The move takes the catcher's breath away. Rio groans against her and flicks her tongue. The thighs around her head are strong and easily muffle the loud moans and gasping breaths mixed with soft curses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha finally catches her breath when her hands scramble to pull lips away from her clit. Rio moans softly and licks her lips as she is yanked away, watching with a smirk as her fingers are coated slick with arousal. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck. I can't wait to see you dripping around my cock.” Rio whispers to herself, shaking her head as the brunette's legs finally release the death grip around her head, falling limply at her sides. Rio stops her thrusting fingers and gently pulls them out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is so busy recovering from her orgasm she doesn't even recognize the pitcher moving away from her, rustling through something beside the bed. When she pulls herself together and pushes up onto her elbows to look at the woman, her mouth goes dry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stands at the other side of the room dressed in nothing but a sports bra and strap on harness with a dark purple dildo jutting from her hips. The tattoo drawn up her thigh, hip and side look like tendrils of black ink in the low light. Backlit from the purple grow lights, Rio looks like Agatha’s best and worst nightmare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How do you want me?” Rio questions gently, still worried about scaring the brunette off. Her hand slowly strokes the dildo until every inch of the silicon is coated in lube. Agatha wets her lips and pushes up to sit on the bed, her thighs still shaking slightly. Her nerves mix in her gut with anticipation and excitement. Now or never. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lay down. I'm getting on top.” Agatha says strongly, trying to take back some control, shifting off of the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why am I not surprised?” Rio responds sarcastically, wiping off her hand with a towel and climbing onto the bed with more grace and dignity than the brunette expected. She sits on the bed with her back pressed into the headboard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up,” Agatha grunts with a severely annoyed look. It makes Rio smirk in satisfaction. She helps her climb onto her lap, the dildo pressing against the brunette's cunt with beautiful contrast. The purple dildo shines just as slick as her thighs. The grow lights give Agatha a beautiful glow behind her and Rio feels her chest tighten at the sight of her. It makes her pause but luckily she passes it off as delaying her pleasure in true tormenting fashion so Agatha doesn't catch on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, ah, ah. Not so fast,” Rio swiftly grips the other woman's hips tightly, keeping her in place instead of allowing her to slide onto the dildo sandwiched between them. Agatha's brow furrows and her hands grapple at Rio's shoulder to keep herself steady. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha already knows where that disapproving tone is leading them, “Rio, I swear to God-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You've already come once, Agatha. I didn't think you would be so </span><em><span>needy</span></em><span>,” Rio taunts swiftly, grasping the base of the dildo and drags the head of the toy through her folds. Agatha's breath is caught between a gasp of pleasure and groan of frustration and annoyance. Rio watches with fascination as slick coats the silicone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s voice shakes slightly before she recovers, “I’m-I’m not.” At least when she fought through the pleasure her tone managed to land with a sharpness. Rio hums in contemplation and pushes the head of the dildo to her entrance, smirking when the hip in her grasp tries to drop and take more of the length. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can take my time. Is that what you're telling me?” Rio says, pulling the dildo out of reach and stroking the toy slick with lube and arousal. Agatha bites back a groan and forces her hips to stay still. She wants Rio to fuck her into the damn mattress but she won't be losing the game so quickly. She's trying to take back some control. She managed to turn the tables earlier. Maybe she can do it again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you need a break…” Agatha draws teasingly and drops her hand between them to take the dildo. Her other hand shifts to press at her sternum, pinning Rio back against the headboard as she takes over stroking the dildo. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio swallows roughly, not expecting the sudden change, her eyes struggling to decide what to watch. Whether it be Agatha’s hand stroking the dildo and hitting the base precisely against her clit or the triumphant smirk on her gorgeous face, she can't decide. Rio’s hips jump at a particularly hard and well placed stroke of the dildo, a soft grunt following the move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh,</span></em><span>” Agatha mutters distractedly, her eyes dropping back to the toy in her hand. She wasn't sure what she was expecting, assuming the visual alone was enough to tease the woman, but it wasn't </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> - a physical reaction of pleasure. Her eyes drift back up to the nearly black eyes studying her, filled with lust, desire and restraint. She strokes again, eyes flashing in excitement when Rio has to bite her lip to muffle a moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can feel it?” Agatha asks curiously, continuing to stroke the dildo. Rio wets her lips and tightens her grip on Agatha’s waist with both hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sometimes, when the base grinds into my clit,” Rio moans again and moves her hand to cover Agatha’s to stop the jerking motion, “But, that's not exactly what I'm worried about when I'm wearing it.” The dark haired woman explains quickly. She does not need to feel even more lust fogged than she already does with the brunette in her lap. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha frowns with a soft huff of disappointment, wanting to continue for many reasons and bringing the other woman pleasure, certainly being in the top three. Not to mention part of her wants to prove to Jen that she isn't a pillow princess. It doesn't exactly make sense because the first baseman can't </span><em><span>actually know</span></em><span> about them but it makes her feel better about all of it in her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It makes you feel good,” Agatha says. Rio hums softly with a small smile, leaning up to connect their lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking you makes me feel good too.” Rio pulls their hands off of the dildo and uses both hands to grab Agatha's ass and pull, shifting her closer towards her body and the dildo. The toy is pinned between their bodies.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You gonna fuck me now?” Agatha whispers, their lips barely leaving each other as she speaks. It feels hot and dirty the way the hand on her ass squeezes and Rio's groan of desire washes over her then melds into the kiss she initiates. Her hands slide into dark hair and takes one of the rare moments of control to kiss Rio like she's never kissed her before. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans as her lips part to give the brunette access, one hand making sure the dildo between them finds home slotted in just the right spot. When Agatha moans and takes the initiative to grind her hips forward she knows the silicone is pressing into her clit. Rio keeps one hand on her ass while the other snakes up to wrap and tug chestnut locks, pulling their mouths apart. They are both panting for breath after that kiss. Agatha moves her hands down to her sides and digs her fingers into her ribs, using the purchase she finds there to grind harder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want me to fuck you?” Rio husks, back to teasing now that she isn't distracted by the pressure on her own clit.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>,” Agatha groans, forcing her hand further between them to try and grab the toy again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There you go again,” Rio swiftly takes Agatha’s reaching hand by the wrist and then the other, pinning them to the small of her back, “So </span><em><span>impatient</span></em><span>.” Agatha's mouth opens and closes, searching for words and coming up short. Her hips have stilled from the shock of her sudden restraint so Rio brings one hand back down to her ass as the other keeps hold of both of her wrists. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I won't be so nice this time, </span><em><span>Ags</span></em><span>.” Rio pulls, forcing her hips to grind against the dildo. “You'll have to ask for it.” Agatha gasps, her hands jerk under her strong grip from trying to steady herself after the sudden move. Rio keeps her steady with a sly smile.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck.” Agatha feels dizzy with desire. Rio’s hand keeping her arms restrained and the other on her ass pushing her harder into the toy is maddening. It shouldn't turn her on as much as it does. And yet, that stupid fucking nickname and that smug fucking smirk makes her want to slap her again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me to stop and I stop,” Rio whispers pointedly, making sure their eyes lock and Agatha understands what she's saying. The brunette nods but she doesn't hesitate to press for more, eyebrows raising in expectation. Agatha feels a flush creep up her neck as she nods harder, not wanting to admit that it feels </span><em><span>so good</span></em><span> to have Rio taking her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha chokes out, another moan following the flush as the slow pace continues. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good,” Rio praises genuinely, palming the flesh in her left hand as her eyes drop down to watch the show. Agatha's cheeks turn red from the praise as heat races up her spine. She feels her embarrassment rise as she </span><em><span>hears</span></em><span> herself coating every inch of the dildo and Rio's defined abs and soft skin beneath it, the sound slick and heavy in the otherwise quiet room. Even her own moans struggle to compete. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You look so fucking hot grinding on my cock.” Agatha would never guess in a million years that those words would come out of Rio's mouth. She certainly wouldn't bet that it would turn her on even more than she already is. A pathetic moan slips past her lips as she pushes her hips through Rio's strong grasp to grind harder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans lustfully and takes her hand away, letting Agatha control the pace. Control she does. Every thrust is faster but more deliberate. Yet, not enough. A frustrated groan leaves Agatha's lips as her head tilts back, sweat already dripping from the back of her neck. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go ahead, Agatha,” Rio says calmly, bringing her hand up to squeeze and caress her breast, plucking at her nipples, “Tell me what you want - what you </span><em><span>need</span></em><span>.” She prods for more, she wants begging but she knows she will need to unravel the stubborn brunette a little more before she gets it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>want</span></em><span> you to fuck me. Was I not clear before?” Agatha raises her head and glares at Rio, making sure to emphasize </span><em><span>want </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><span>need</span></em><span>. Rio chuckles and brings her hands back down to stop her hips. Of course she has a sassy comeback. Her hands move them enough to tease the tip at her entrance but stops there. Agatha sighs heavily and narrows her glare, Rio's smile widens. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I could tease you like this all night and never get bored.” Rio admits happily, waiting for her lips to part to finally sink inside of her dripping cunt. Agatha’s breath catches, an insult on the tip of her tongue when Rio finally slides inside of her. A loud moan climbs from her throat as she sinks down into her lap, the dildo filling her inch by inch until their bodies are flush. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck, Rio.</span></em><span>” Agatha gasps out as her hands move back up to her shoulders, nails digging into the skin there. Rio feels the pressure on her clit and fights back the urge to thrust upward for more contact. She takes a few deep breaths and watches Agatha adjust to the size, eyes closed and bottom lip caught between her teeth. She is a vision and the sight of her alone makes her want to absolutely </span><em><span>ravish</span></em><span> her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus, Agatha, you look so fucking beautiful when you slide down on my cock.” Rio groans and leans forward to take her nipple between her lips and suck harshly until she hears a grunt of discomfort. Her hands dig in, taking handfuls of her ass and squeezing once before pulling up. Agatha gasps at the move, sliding an inch or so off of the dildo before being brought back down to the hilt. She hasn't felt anything like this. Ralph, while slightly above average, has nothing on the substantial dildo Rio is thrusting inside of her right now.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck- feels so fucking full- so good.” Agatha mutters, dropping her hips with the next move and shivering when a warm wet mouth latches onto her neglected nipple. One hand slides into dark hair and fists to keep the other woman close while she begins a steady rhythm. Rio moans into the skin in front of her and bucks her hips for more friction. When Agatha moans in response she lets her hips jog upwards to meet her thrusts. They easily establish a steady rhythm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just like that - </span><em><span>oh, fuck</span></em><span>,” Agatha cries out when teeth graze her sensitive nipple, a smile from the other woman shining up at her no doubt. She rides the dildo a little harder, slamming her hips down and down until the bed rocks and squeaks beneath them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“God damn,” Rio grunts, her forehead resting against Agatha’s sweat slicked chest while she pants for breath. Every fucking thrust is grinding the base of the dildo into her clit. Agatha tugs on soft hair until Rio is grunting in pleasurable pain, sounding so animalistic and maybe even desperate, their lips crash into a kiss. It makes her feel powerful to have Rio moaning for her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jealousy swiftly overtakes that feeling when she wonders if other women can make Rio moan like she is right now. Maybe she’s the only one? If Jen is right and Rio does all the fucking maybe she doesn’t do this with her other women. She rips their mouths apart, enjoying the hazy lust in dark eyes and kiss swollen lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you fuck every woman like this?” Agatha whispers breathlessly, insecurity hiding in the back of her throat. Rio hesitates before a sly smile spreads across her lips, and in that moment, Agatha knows she shouldn't have asked. No, she regrets even </span><em><span>thinking</span></em><span> about it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jealous?” Rio questions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck you.” Agatha bites out quickly, embarrassment and anger chasing each other around and around in her stomach as she forces her hips to move harder. To take more and more until the thought is out of her mind. Until Rio fucking other women with this exact strap on is out of her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You already are </span><em><span>sweetheart,</span></em><span>” Rio chuckles at her own words and Agatha groans in annoyance then in lust. Her orgasm is approaching quickly and she really wants to come without thinking about Rio and that fucking brunette from the party fucking in this bed. </span><em><span>God damn it</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Shut. Up.</span></em><span>” Agatha growls, “I didn't think you could be more annoying - shit.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn't think you could be so fucking wet.” Rio jabs back, easily distracted by Agatha who is starting to grind with every downward thrust. Her hands push and pull down and up on the hips under her hands to pick up the pace, both of them moaning. Fuck, this is distracting her from her plan.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Admit it,” Rio breathes out, face screwing up in pleasure as her hips jerk, “You love it when I fuck you.” She wants validation without really asking for it. She wants to hear Agatha beg for </span><em><span>her</span></em><span>, only her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So close,” Agatha breathes out, choosing to focus on her orgasm instead of the infuriating woman beneath her, spine arching from the pleasure that zips through her. Suddenly the hands on her hips stop their movements and her eyes fly open to look down at the other woman. Her orgasm falls out of reach and her eyes glint with rage. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Agatha hisses. Rio gently eases the brunette off of the dildo and her lap, pushing her back onto the bed. Agatha falls onto her back with a surprised yelp, staring up at the other woman in shock. She can count on one hand the amount of times a man has even </span><em><span>tried</span></em><span> to throw her around and every time it pissed her off. It shouldn't make her throb with want when Rio does it so effortlessly but it does. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I asked a question and didn't hear an answer.” Rio responds calmly, moving onto her knees between the brunette's spread legs. She may as well be holding the dildo hostage, gliding the tip through her wet folds and watching as more arousal coats the silicone. Agatha moans and arches into the touch on her clit, legs spreading wider in invitation. Rio smiles and runs her palm up and down her thigh, squeezing softly when her fingers reach her hip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So beautiful, so stubborn.” Rio shakes her head. Agatha huffs and grips the sheets below her harder. She is trying to restrain her sharp tongue to get what she wants. She doesn't know how long that tactic will last. Her teeth bit into the flesh of her lip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me you love how I fuck you,” Rio says conversationally, offering the woman an ultimatum as she slides inside of her again, “and </span><em><span>maybe</span></em><span> I will let you come.” Agatha groans with the intrusion, exhaling a shaky breath as Rio pushes all the way inside of her. The new angle reaches deeper and the feeling consumes her. Eyes closed in pleasure, teeth digging into her bottom lip and her hips shaking with the desire to thrust herself onto the dildo. She is a mess. Rio has made her a mess and she knows it. Strong hands move from her hips to palm and tease her breasts. She arches into the touch with a moan and momentary lapse of judgment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love how you fuck me,” Agatha breathes out, soft and sweet, grinding up to take more of the toy with a moan. Rio's breath stutters and her eyes widen slightly. She had not expected such a compliant response. And yet, it sounded so genuine and </span><em><span>needy</span></em><span>. She can't imagine hearing it any other way. Her hips roll forward to meet Agatha’s, their hips flush, and the base of the strap on hitting her clit just right. A filthy moan rips from the brunette below her and sends a pleased groan from her own mouth in response. </span><em><span>God, give her strength.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That's right, baby, you love how I fuck you.” Rio husks softly, moving her hands to Agatha's wrists and pinning them above her head to lean slightly over her. The pet name slips from her lips before she can catch it. Blue eyes flutter open in surprise but nothing in them tells her to stop - not even an insult or demand. So, Rio's free hand keeps a strong grip on her rolling hips to guide their movements. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s lips part with a moan and her legs wrap around her hips, drawing her in deeper, a guttural moan echoing each other. She forces herself to forget how delicious it feels to have Rio sweating and moaning over top of her while calling her </span><em><span>baby</span></em><span>. It's addictive. It's dangerous. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I knew you could be good for me.” Rio whispers, eyes trained on where their bodies meet and grind. Agatha releases a heady, electric moan before she can stop it. Her eyes slam shut and her bottom lip is tucked between her teeth to cut off the disgraceful sound, embarrassment flushing through her. Her breath catches as Rio’s hips falter for a split second before renewing her thrust with more vigor. A near whimper crawling to her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is finding out a lot about the brunette tonight. She always knew Agatha liked dirty talk even if she acts like she doesn't. She figured she liked a rough hand every now and again so that was an easy test. A little bit of manhandling and hair pulling told her that pretty quickly. A praise kink…she didn't think about that. She should've known. Agatha works hard, kicks ass on the daily, and based off of who her mother is, she never hears how fucking amazing she is. Rio finds herself hell bent on changing that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're taking me so well, Agatha. Just like that.” Rio whispers, her eyes flickering up to Agatha’s face to watch her moan. Her hips pick up speed when blue eyes flutter open. Agatha can see the realization in the pitcher's eyes, she knows what will drive her crazy. Hell, Rio has a full arsenal of what would drive Agatha crazy. It's too much for Agatha. Vulnerability and embarrassment swirl in her gut and she tries to close her eyes again. Rio won't have that. Her hand grasps her jaw and blue eyes flash open in disbelieving shock, grip tightening when the brunette tries to look away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Watch me while I fuck you,” Rio demands. Agatha feels the swirl of feelings in her gut change into anger, grateful for the change in their dynamic falling back into place. Agatha resisting and Rio pursuing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can your ego get any bigger?” Agatha hisses, managing to keep the moan out of her voice. She rips her chin from her grasp with a glare. Rio groans softly in annoyance. She wants nothing more than to take care of the brunette, give her everything she wants, and she makes it so difficult. </span><em><span>Stubborn. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moves her hand down to roughly palm her breast and pinch her nipple between two fingers. Agatha gasps and arches her back, moaning with the touch. Her orgasm rushes to the forefront of her mind. Exactly what Rio wants. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine,” Rio says sternly, releasing her wrists and breasts to lean back and grab her hips, “If you want to be stubborn, be my guest. I can go all night.” Agatha's brow furrows in confusion, her lustful mind struggling to understand her words, but promptly forgetting them when the other woman's hips set a punishing pace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy- fuck, yes!” Agatha cries out, her free hands reaching down to grasp at flexing biceps. Her fingernails bite into skin. Rio hisses with the pain but forces herself to focus on bringing Agatha closer to her quickly impending orgasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha doesn't know why Rio is suddenly so amenable but she will not be questioning it. The new pace inches her closer and closer to her orgasm with pleasure crawling to every inch of her body. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I-I’m coming. Fuck, Rio, right there!” Agatha digs her fingers into hot, sweaty skin to keep her motivated. The thrusts stop and her hands are pinned to the bed on either side of her head in seconds. Her eyes widened in rage, glinting with danger and focusing on the woman hovering above her, a bright amused smile shining down at her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Beg</span></em><span>,” Rios whispers calmly. She refuses to move, refuses to even breathe, and waits for a response. Agatha pants for breath, glaring at Rio and daring to struggle out of her grasp. The hands around her wrist tighten just enough to stop her escape. Rio raises an eyebrow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want to stop?” She questions seriously, knowing the answer but needing to ask regardless. Agatha stops struggling against her hold and clenches around the dildo as her hips try to move to take more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>No</span></em><span>,” Agatha answered reluctantly through clenched teeth. Rio starts moving again, shallow thrusts and a slow grind when she bottoms out. It makes Agatha’s legs shake so she tightens them around a narrow waist to keep her twitching muscles under control. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Beg me to make you come.” Rio whispers again, taking her time and ignoring her own growing pleasure in order to tease the brunette. Agatha struggles to keep her breathing under control. She looks down between them to see Rio's flexing abs and tattooed ribs slick with sweat, maybe even her own arousal glints in the soft light. Her head drops back against the mattress with a soft thud and a moan. She's desperate but she is also stubborn and giving Rio the satisfaction of hearing her beg does not sound appealing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What if I don't?” Agatha asks, truly taunts, and fixes her gaze on dark brown eyes. Rio smirks and slows her thrusts as she releases one wrist to bring her thumb to rub against her throbbing clit, delighted in the guttural moan Agatha releases. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you, Ags,” Rio husks, slowly pulling the dildo out of the woman but continuing to rub her clit. Agatha feels her stomach drop at the thought of Rio stopping entirely, pulling out of her and refusing her anything and everything.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can go,” Rio pushes inside for one long thrust before pulling back out. Agatha releases a relieved and whiny moan.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>All</span></em><span>.” Another deep thrust before pulling out again, smiling at the moan she receives in return. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Night</span></em><span>.” Agatha groans as the dildo reaches new depth, her cunt clenching strongly around the silicone, hoping to keep it inside of her. A more frustrated groan leaves her when Rio pulls out. Already, she knows she won't be able to last like this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha's voice is needy and desperate but Rio can tell she is putting on a show. It is nothing like the first time she heard that voice. The sound of it is ingrained in Rio’s head for the rest of her life. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not good enough,” Rio responds swiftly, sinking inside to the hilt and grinding her clit into the base of the strap on with a moan. Agatha huffs softly and uses her free hand to cup her breast and play with her nipple, switching tactics.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't you want me to come for you?” Agatha breathes out all sickly sweet and seductive. Rio moans softly and bites her lip. Her eyes drift up and down the woman's writhing body. A hand cups her tit, her luscious bottom lip caught between her teeth as she moans, and blue eyes hooded with seductive desire.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't you want me to come on your cock, Rio?” Agatha moans as she says her name, hips rolling as much as they can in the tight space between them. Rio swallows dryly and feels her hips twitch at the nasty words she never thought she would hear from the catcher. A deep moan rumbles in her chest when the brunette's rolling hips force the strap on base to stroke against her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha knows she is getting somewhere when Rio’s head falls forward slightly, raven hair falling into her eyes as they close, and her spine arches into the attention. She loves having the ability to distract the very disciplined and determined woman. Men are so easy, she just has to bat her lashes to make them lose control. Rio is a challenge. She loves a challenge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can't help it, can you?” Rio whispers, distracted but still very determined and not falling into her honey trap. She pulls her thumb from her clit and thrusts a little harder, pulling a twin moan from the both of them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You just love being a tease.” Agatha gasps as the woman fucks deep into her with long thrusts. The pace stays the same, painfully slow, but the thrusts themselves land hard and rough. She isn't making the progress she thought she was. She feels like she's been teetering on the edge of her climax for hours. Her free hand comes up to Rio's chest, gripping her sports bra by the shoulder strap and tugs. Rio lets her body drop forward, releases the captive wrist in her grasp to drop to her elbow above Agatha’s shoulder. They are so close they're lips are nearly touching.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>.” Agatha is desperate, dragging her lips over the soft lips in front of her. Begging without </span><em><span>begging</span></em><span>. Her hands find home in dark hair to keep Rio close. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio wants to break, she wants to indulge in her pleasure. She wants to </span><em><span>drown</span></em><span> in everything that is </span><em><span>Agatha Harkness</span></em><span>, but there are so many reasons she can't do that. Not now. Maybe not ever. So she stays strong, keeping her well timed thrusts, and sneaking one hand between them to palm the woman's breast. Her lips press lightly against the ones begging for more attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Beg.</span></em><span>” A soft kiss.</span> <span>“</span><em><span>Me.</span></em><span>” Another. Rio picks up the pace, pinching her nipple, and moving her kisses to Agatha's arching neck. A frustrated groan rumbles against her lips and she smiles into heated skin on her next kiss. Her tongue swipes salty skin and her teeth nip with desire to leave a mark. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans and takes the dildo thrust for thrust. The bed shakes and squeaks with the exertion. In seconds, she is close again. Her arms wrap around the pitcher's strong back and her nails dig in. The grunt of pain she hears in her ear in response only sends her that much closer to the edge. Her breath comes in harsh panting breaths with moans mingling in between. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, Rio.” Agatha grunts, burying her face in Rio's shoulder. Hot breath washes over her neck, the pitcher's own moans and grunts sounding in her ear, and taunting lips still kissing her neck and shoulder, likely leaving marks where she can. Agatha feels Rio slowing down, getting ready to refuse another orgasm, and she panics. She whimpers softly, embarrassingly, and tenses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio, please,</span></em><span>” The plea leaves Agatha's lips to be muffled in sweat-slicked skin but Rio hears it. A sigh of relief almost leaves Rio, her hips easily thrusting back on a punishing and rewarding pace. A moan of pleasure works from both of their throats.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come for me,” Rio growls as she moves her hand to the back of Agatha's neck, holding her close as she pumps her hips. Agatha gasps and moans, holding on for dear life as Rio ruins her. She pushes her orgasm through her body with each forceful plunge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The long awaited orgasm rips through Agatha like a tsunami. Her eyes shut so tight the bursts of light behind her eyelids is blinding. Her hands grasp and tug at any part of the woman she can get her hands on. Her moans, gasps and curses sound loudly through the room over their panting breaths and squeaking bed frame. Rio doesn't stop and Agatha feels like she's melting into the bed with each thrust.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio wonders if she should stop, force Agatha to take a breath, when the catcher finally gasps for air. The hands on her back move to hold her still so she slows her thrusts until she is buried inside of Agatha once again. They both catch their breath while the brunette rides out the last of her orgasm. Rio rests her head on her shoulder, taking in breath after breath and hearing the brunette do the same.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha's head falls back onto the mattress and she tries to control her shaking legs but it is useless. Her limbs fall limply around the pitcher. Rio places soft kisses across her skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm going to pull out now,” Rio whispers softly, steadying herself on her elbows but the hands on her sides stop her from moving. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wh-What about you?” Agatha whispers, wondering how she can return the favor. It makes a knot of anxiety in her gut but she pushes through, blissed out enough to not think about semantics. She just wants Rio to feel good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't worry about me. I don't want you to be uncomfortable.” Rio dismisses her offer, despite the throbbing ache between her thighs, and slowly pulls out. Agatha gasps softly and releases a small moan at the retreat. Rio leans back on her ankles, looking over the flushed woman, and biting her lip with a soft moan at the view of her soaked pussy. The urge to taste her again is undeniable, and why shouldn't she? She did make the brunette a promise to achieve three orgasms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gasps softly as strong hands move her tiresome limbs, pushing her further down the bed until her head is nearly reaching the edge of the mattress. She looks up just in time to see Rio dropping onto her stomach, the dark haired woman wraps her arms around her thighs and dives in. The shock of Rio's warm tongue against her heated folds makes her jump, the feeling of her sensitive clit being brushed with that same tongue makes her yelp. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha hisses, hands finding purchase on the mattress to scramble away. “I can't-” Rio tightens her grip hard enough to ensure fingerprint bruises in the morning, a hard look in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> and you </span><em><span>will</span></em><span>. I promised you three orgasms.” Rio leaves no room for argument, dropping her head and groaning softly with the taste of Agatha Harkness. The brunette is at a loss for words. She gasps and moans, one hand cupping the back of Rio's head with shaking fingers as her head falls back on her shoulders. She is sensitive, barely able to withstand the overwhelming sensation that is Rio's red hot mouth. It hurts in such a delightful way - like taking a hot shower or standing too close to a fire. It tingles and burns and makes Agatha feel so hot she might combust. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grunts in satisfaction, happily indulging herself in the other woman without resistance. She shifts on her stomach, the warm, wet dildo poking uncomfortably into her stomach. She shifts her hips, subtly trying to find some comfort, and moans deeply into heated wet flesh when the base rides just perfectly across her clit. Her breath catches but her mouth continues to work, her hands continue to keep Agatha spread and close. She shifts again and can't help the near whimper that is muffled by the other woman's cunt. One more thrust, then a second, suddenly she is grinding into the bed like a bitch in heat while eating her fill of Agatha’s pussy. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Fuck, she could come like this.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is lost in the sensations, her mouth sucking and flicking, tasting every inch of Agatha she can lick up. All while her hips jerk and buck against the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is near clueless, drowning in pleasure as the pitcher brings her to the edge. She wouldn't be any wiser to Rio’s current predicament if it weren't for the soft whine that she </span><em><span>knows</span></em><span> isn't coming from her. She raises her head, half lidded eyes dropping to watch Rio, immersed in eating her out like her life depends on it. The sight alone has her moaning, fist tightening in dark hair as her lips part to release a deep moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Another whimper sounds muffled and strained against her cunt, the vibrations ricocheting against her clit like an echo. The noise sounds so needy and desperate she questions if it isn't her making the noise. Agatha’s jaw drops when her eyes notice the source of Rio's sudden despair. Rio's strong hips buck and grind lazily against the base of the dildo, harsh pants for breath and soft, muffled noises get lost between Agatha's thighs. It is music to her ears. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha never thought she would enjoy just how </span><em><span>good</span></em><span> Rio sounds when she's desperate to fall apart. Of course she is, containing her own craving of pleasure just to get Agatha her greedy amount of </span><em><span>three orgasms</span></em><span>. The third orgasm she is currently approaching at a fast pace. Her pussy spasms and she makes a decision she knows she won't regret. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck me,” Agatha rasps, tugging at dark hair until those deep brown eyes flutter open to look up at her. Devoted and desperate and a glint of curiosity, Agatha decides this look best suits Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>However, the young woman doesn't move even though her hips still, her tongue continues wickedly whipping Agatha closer to the edge. Rio's eyes watching her so intensely have her nearly giving up on the little plan in her head. Instead, she tugs a little harder and rears her hips back as much as she can to keep her cunt out of reach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio's eyes change in an instant, furious and feral, that her feast has been taken away, a low growl of anger and pleasurable pain rumbling from her chest at her hair being pulled. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Demon in the sheets.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gets it now. The feral look in her eyes, the mess of </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> on her lips and chin, a wordless promise to bring her victim within an inch of death. She despises the other women who have seen Rio like this. Agatha pulls her up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck,</span></em><span>” Agatha whispers breathlessly, reaching between them as the pitcher crawls up the bed with taught muscles straining for control, “</span><em><span>Me.”</span></em><span> Her voice is nothing more than a low moan between them, Agatha leading the tip of the cock to her entrance. Rio slips inside with ease, filling her to the hilt with one slow thrust. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio swallows the gasp that escapes red, kiss bruised lips as their mouths crash together. Her mind is nearly blank for once. Thinking about two things, Agatha's orgasm and her own. The dildo hits her clit exactly how she wants it when she bottoms out. It makes her hips tense and her thighs to shake, fucking into the brunette through her twitching muscles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans, the feeling of being so full once again satisfying the craving deep inside of her. The taste on her tongue is a heady mix of simply Rio and her own arousal which truly drives her crazy everytime. It makes her want more, to fist a hand in dark hair and lick her lips until they're clean. She bites at Rio's bottom lip as they part and relishes in the lustful groan she receives in return. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck me into the God damn bed Rio,” Agatha hisses, dragging her nails down Rio's muscular back to hear her hiss in pain and moan in pleasure. She ends with two firm handfuls of her ass and grinds up, pulling the dildo deeper. She falls back into the bed with a guttural moan when the pitcher starts thrusting, hard and fast. Agatha feels her orgasm ready to snap her spine at the first given chance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You feel so </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>, Agatha - </span><em><span>oh God</span></em><span>.” Rio grits out, hips grinding in every thrust. It feels good, so good, but she doesn't know if she can come like this. As much as she wants to come with the strap buried deep in Agatha's pussy, it feels like it is out of her reach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, like that - just like that. Don't stop,” Agatha moans, thighs quaking as her spine arches, her orgasm exploding with pleasure between her legs. Her breath catches in her chest, Rio's hips relentlessly pumping forward to fuck her through her climax. Every inch of her walls clamping and fluttering to keep the dildo inside of her. Soft grunts and moans, curses and gentle praises just barely reach her ears flooded by the sound of her own beating heart.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Breathe for me, baby.” Rio demands in a husky voice, slowing her hips as soon as she noticed Agatha’s lack of breathing. The brunette, for once, follows her instructions, gasping in a breath through a loud desperate moan. Rio forgets her own pleasure, eyes locked in on the woman below her, and pumps her hips gently until Agatha is spent. Rio swallows roughly and resists the urge to grind forward for her own pleasure. Agatha finally gathers herself enough to squeeze the ass in her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep going. Wanna make you come,” Agatha breathes out blissfully. Rio feels her hips begging to jerk forward at the raspy, lust riddled voice of the other woman nudging her toward her own pleasure. As surprisingly thoughtful as that notion is, it's not going to happen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can't - not like this,” Rio grits out, slowly rearing back her hips to pull out the dildo. Agatha’s eyes flutter open and her hands glide up Rio's ribs then back down to her hips, determination in her eyes. She wants Rio to come - to fall apart as Agatha has </span><em><span>three</span></em> <em><span>times</span></em><span> tonight, just once. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me what you need,” Agatha says sternly, bringing one hand to Rio’s chest before gliding up and around the back of her neck, forcing her to stay close. Her fingernails scratch lightly at the nape of her neck then up into her hair. It has the desired effect, sending the other woman's body taut with anticipation. It makes Rio's head swim, leaning into the touch as her breathing quickens, but her head shakes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don't have to-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me how to fuck you,” Agatha cuts off the rejection, refusing to be another one of Rio's straight little freshman hookups who never return the favor. She wants it. She doesn't exactly know how and it honestly scares her a little but she </span><em><span>wants</span></em><span> Rio to be putty in her hands. Rio grunts softly, jaw muscles flexing with a stubborn restraint that Agatha wishes she would just let go - </span><em><span>oh</span></em><span>. This must be how Rio feels when she is being…</span><em><span>strong willed</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha reaches down, taking the dildo slick with her arousal into her hand and pumps it once, tip to base, delighted to see Rio's hips thrust forward into her hand. A shiver rolls down her spine with the pinched moan that sounds in her ear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio's eyes close tightly, her hips jerking into the hand holding the strap on. It feels good and gives her enough pressure and friction that it </span><em><span>might</span></em><span> get her over the edge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>But she wants Agatha, any part of her, but she doesn't want to push her into touching her when she's not ready. She doesn't want to scare her away when Agatha Harkness is the only thing in her life that feels calm and comfortable. As if Agatha can see the dilemma running through her mind, she narrows her eyes and tightens her grip on soft hair, brown eyes jumping up to her own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm not going anywhere until you come,” Agatha hisses, pumping her hand harshly around the silicone and watching as Rio crumbles with pleasure. The tension in her shoulders drops and her hips buck toward the pleasure with an unrestricted grunt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>So</span></em><span>, tell me how to fuck you.” Agatha demands. Rio takes a few breaths and sits back, reaching for the buckles of the harness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let's start slow,” Rio reasons softly, tossing the harness and dildo onto the floor to be cleaned later. Agatha wets her lips, heart hammering in her chest when Rio’s naked body comes into view. She pushes up onto her elbows to get a better look, gut twisting with desire and anxiety. She pushes through it, pushing up higher to lean back on her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How do you want me?” Desire constricts her throat, her words coming out rough and raw. Rio's chest tightens with the question, pushing away dangerous thoughts of movie nights and candlelight dinner dates, her hand cupping Agatha's face to bring her in for a kiss. It is a crushing and desperate kiss, their tongues fighting for dominance, while Rio climbs into Agatha’s lap. She hesitates as they part before blue eyes look up at her hopeful and excited even with a shimmer of apprehension. She slips out of her sports bra slowly, tossing it aside to join the strap on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is completely bare to Agatha's blue eyes. She lets her adjust, running her hands through her thick wild mane of hair, scratching her blunt nails across her scalp. Agatha takes in every inch, the insatiable heat between her thighs begging for more at just the sight of Rio's body. Her breasts, while smaller than Agatha’s, sit so pretty on her chest, dusky nipples aching for attention. She shifts her weight to bring both hands to Rio's ribs. Glancing up at the woman and receiving an encouraging nod, she finally cups her breasts. Agatha has touched her before, either in the throes of her orgasm or while the pitcher is knuckle deep inside of her, but this feels different - intimate. Nothing like the emotionally detached hookups they've had before.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sighs, chest arching into the brunette's warm hands. Agatha hums softly in awe, squeezing gently and familiarizing herself with them, thumb teasing across her pebbled nipples. Taking one into her mouth seemed like second nature and by Rio’s surprised gasp and subsequent moan, it was the right move. Agatha hums again, savoring the taste of her skin, and experimentally sucking to draw another reaction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, that feels good,” Rio whispers, her hand threading in brown locks as she keeps her mouth on her breast. Agatha’s willingness and initiative to give her more  also gives her a little bit of relief and eases the tension at the base of her spine. Agatha takes her time, groping, licking, sucking her chest. Even leaving a prominent mark on the top of Rio’s left breast. Rio is panting heavily for breath, forcing herself to keep the pace slow, to test the brunette's reactions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give me your hand,” Rio says, reaching for Agatha’s left hand and cautiously bringing her fingers downward to run over her stomach. Her skin is soft and the rippling muscles underneath are hard. They twitch and jump at Agatha’s touch no matter how hard Rio tries to control them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha takes over, dragging her fingers lower and lower until she reaches the soft patch of wiry black curls. She bites her lip and glances up at the other woman to gauge her reaction when she moves lower. Rio watches her closely, like a hunter scouting a deer, once again combing her hands calmly through brown locks. She nods her head in encouragement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha helplessly turns her eyes back to her fingers, finally skating through Rio's soaked cunt, a soft moan leaks past her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're so wet,” Agatha breathes out, watching intently as Rio’s hips jerk forward towards her adventurous hand. Rio tries to practice restraint, her hips nearly shaking with the effort, unsure how long she will be able to keep it up. Agatha delves deeper, practicing the similar moves she would use on herself - the techniques Rio has used to drive her crazy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stay there</span><em><span> - right there, baby</span></em><span>,” Rio grits out, unable to stop the short grind of her hips. Agatha moans softly at the desperate, needy version of Rio Vidal currently sitting in her lap. She is no longer curious as to why anyone would choose women over men. Rio fucks her like it's their last day on earth </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> her pussy practically drips with her desire. She loves it, the feeling of arousal coating her fingers and the pretty sounds Rio just can't contain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like this?” Agatha questions, her fingers pressing a little harder and starting small circles across her clit. Rio moans louder now, open and unabashed as she holds their gaze. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mhmm, just like that. So good Agatha.” Rio husks, her fingers in silky hair tugging her forward. Agatha takes the not so subtle direction, happy to hide her blushing cheeks from the praise, and drops her mouth back to Rio's attention seeking nipples. Rio groans lustfully, grinding down on the hand rubbing her clit. She wants more, to be filled by Agatha. She moves one hand down to Agatha's, lightly taking her wrist and pulling her mouth back from her breast. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Use your fingers, two,” Rio whispers gently, moving Agatha’s hand slowly lower to give her time to change her mind, “Can you do that for me?” Agatha nods her head, eager to comply and give the woman everything she needs. She leans back slightly with her eyes cast down to watch her fingers disappear into Rio's wet heat. She distantly hears her moans and soft curses but Agatha can only focus on the velvety wall slowly engulfing her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good - so good. Move Agatha, pump your fingers like I would. Fuck me.” Agatha's eyes light up and widen at Rio's breathy moans leaking into her words and the way her cunt squeezes around her. Her eyes trail back up to the woman's face, pleased to see her normal calm facade crumbling away, twisted with pleasure. Lips parted to let moans, praises, and curses slip freely. Eyes hooded with desire but still keeping a watchful eye on the brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha apparently has a compliance streak in her now, doing as she's told and loving the product of her own actions unfurling before her. Rio spots the wonder and lust in Agatha's eyes and knows they've passed any anxiety and uncertainty the brunette might have about touching her. </span><em><span>Thank God</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Curl your fingers.” Rio instructs, her hips moving to help the brunette fuck her. Agatha hums in acknowledgment and curls her fingers as much as she can, drawing a deep moan from the chest in front of her. Rio won’t last long, the time before her climax diminishing sooner when one hand drops down to her clit. Agatha’s brow furrows. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Agatha husks sternly when she pulls back from her breast, her other hand dropping to pull Rio’s hand away. “I want to do it.” The angle isn’t good for her right hand so she uses a position the pitcher has used on her before, pressing the heel of her palm into her clit. The position is a little awkward at first but soon she gets the hang of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio certainly thinks so, grinding harder into her palm with a smile. Her hand returns to the brunette’s hair, gripping tightly. “It’s kind of hot when you boss me around like that captain.” She taunts, sounding breathless but still entirely too smug for Agatha’s liking. Rio pulls back on the fistful of hair until blue eyes are looking up at her and their lips are inches away from each other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s almost like you think you’re in control.” Rio smirks and a moan follows soon after. Her hips grind harder, coming closer and closer to the edge. Teasing the brunette while she comes undone is a happy coincidence that only aids in her undoing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha narrows her eyes. Of course the infuriating woman would be taunting her while literally getting fucked. Her instinctive retort of ‘fuck you’ is begging to leave her lips but she has more of her wits about her right now and holds it in to avoid Rio’s biting, sassy comment she surely has loaded up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know what I think? I think you’re about to come for me.” Agatha whispers, her forearm burns with the new effort and unusual twist of her wrist and fingers but she works through the pain to bring Rio closer to the edge. Rio’s grip in her hair turns painful, her blunt nails digging into the back of her neck as her breathing picks up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>think</span></em><span> that means I’m in charge,” Agatha grits out, pumping her fingers harder and curling them just right. “I’m going to be the sole reason you fall apart and you couldn’t stop even if you wanted to.” Rio gasps, meeting her thrust for thrust, tongue tied and desperate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The power dynamics flipping on her so quickly is not something she saw coming. Rio feels her cheeks flushing. She loves it - loves to see Agatha taking what she wants. She also loves the dirty mouth she gets when she’s fucking her and god damn is she doing such a good job. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio hasn’t been fucked in months, one reason or another always getting in the way before, but recently she wasn’t sure Agatha was willing. So, since Rio was already on the edge from simply fucking the brunette with a strap on, Agatha was right, she couldn’t stop even if she wanted to. She definitely doesn’t want to. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>.” Rio moans, finally shutting her eyes and dropping her head back on her shoulders. Agatha echoes her moan and watches every second, </span><em><span>feels</span></em><span> every second, </span><em><span>listens</span></em><span> to every second as Rio’s climax wrecks her body. Commit everything to memory. The walls around her fingers clamp so tightly she worries about continuing but she also can’t imagine stopping. Not now. Not when Rio is moaning and cursing while her body shakes and grinds for more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Beautiful,” Agatha husks, frozen in awe as the woman in her lap comes undone. It is a sight to behold. Nothing could be better than this. One of Rio’s hands shoots down to grab her wrist, stopping her thrusts but grinding into her palm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck.” Agatha groans lustfully, managing to wiggle out of the other woman’s grasp in her hair to look between them. Wetness coats her entire hand, strong hips bucking for friction while her thighs shake. The moans that slip from her mouth are ragged and breathless when her head raises again, sounding right in her ear. Agatha can tell her body is exhausted, the orgasm having stolen her breath and the ability to control her shaking limbs, even still her body rolls for more friction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You learn quick.” Rio whispers, eyes closed and breathing still heaving her chest. Agatha chuckles softly, a prideful little smile crossing her lips as she slowly curls her fingers. The stimulation tears a moan from pleasure bitten lips, those same lips curling into a smile and dark eyes fluttering open. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you go again or do you need another break?” Agatha teases, continuing her shallow thrusts. Rio bites her lip and releases the catcher’s wrist to cup her jaw and tilt her head up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t make me show you who’s boss, Captain.” Rio says smoothly before pulling their lips together, dropping her hand back between them but bypassing the other woman's wrist to touch her instead. Agatha moans into the kiss and picks up her pace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’d like to see you try.” </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Agatha sighs in content, burrowing her head into the comfort of the insanely soft sheets that smell of eucalyptus, bergamot and…</span><em><span>sex</span></em><span>. Her eyes slowly peek open to see a mess of dark hair fanning across the pillow below her head. </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>. A soft smile spreads across her lips, her back bowing with a stretch. She groans softly as nearly every muscle in her body screams with soreness that can only come from a good, long, rough night of sex. It feels delicious. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio makes a soft noise, shifting slightly but still asleep. Agatha moves closer, her lips finding the soft skin of Rio’s back as her hand slides onto her hip. She places kisses across her back, venturing up to her shoulder then finally her neck when Rio begins to wake up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Insatiable,” Rio croaks with a raspy, sleep ladened voice that sends shivers down Agatha’s spine. Agatha chuckles softly, pressing her naked body fully against the other woman and moving the hand on her hip around her ribs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Me…” Agatha whispers, cupping her breast and stroking her thumb across Rio’s already perky nipple with a satisfied smirk when the woman arches into her touch, “or you?” She can spot her bright smile over her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You, definitely.” Rio shifts onto her back, pulling Agatha into a kiss as soon as she can. Both women feel the heat igniting between their thighs, Agatha swiftly sliding on top of Rio. Before they can get further than grinding into each other’s thighs, an alarm cuts through the small dorm room and makes them both jump. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans in frustration and reaches over to stop the annoying noise. She is seconds from returning to the very tempting activities with the other woman when reality comes crushing down on both of them - the reason the alarm was set.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The bus.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The game.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They scramble from the bed, gathering clothes and yanking them on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What time is it?” Agatha asks, pulling on the first shirt she can find even if it’s not her own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, seven fifteen” Rio answers quickly, pulling her hair back into a ponytail and shoving a handful of clothes into a backpack. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The bus leaves at eight - fuck. Coach is going to kill me.” Agatha combs her unruly hair away from her face and grabs her backpack. “Stall him.” Rio’s eyebrows shoot up in shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Stall</span></em><span> Coach Herb? How the fuck am I suppossed-” Rio complains. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ll figure it out!” Agatha hisses quickly, rushing out the door before Rio can continue complaining. Agatha’s walk of shame is more like a run, earning more than a few concerned and confused looks as she runs through the dorm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans, shoving a few more clothes into her bag and packing up her gear. By the time she makes it to the bus she is five minutes before departure and Herb is already anxiously tapping his foot. A glare burns into her as soon as he catches sight of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I know. I’m late.” Rio begins lamely, earning a harsher glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s five after Vidal and you are only one of two players without your asses on that bus. Care to explain?” Herb asks calmly but nothing can take the anger from his eyes. Rio tries very hard to think of any other response besides; </span><em><span>Sorry, Coach, Agatha and I were busy fucking each other until four o’clock in the morning</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, I don’t have a good excuse.” Rio answers honestly, increasing the glare burning a hole in her head as Sharon comes to stand next to Herb. “</span><em><span>But</span></em><span> I can make it up to you. With anything you need. Anything to help out the team, I-I am your girl.” Rio sounds so unconvincing. She can’t even keep the wavering cringe out of her voice. Herb doesn’t know her well but he knows her enough to know she is trying to buy time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha tears around the corner of the parking lot and slams on her breaks to stop herself from running into the bus. Sharon jumps out of her skin, placing a hand over her chest as she clings to Herb in shock. Herb simply switches his anger to his Captain. Rio takes the opportunity to slide past the coaches and into the bus with a relieved sigh, sort of throwing Agatha to the wolves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sure enough, every person on the bus is trying their damndest to listen to Agatha get chewed out by the two coaches. Well, more so Herb while Sharon stands supportively at his side. Rio smirks and makes her way to the back of the bus. In a few seconds Agatha is climbing onto the bus with a deadly glare shooting towards the pitcher at the back of the bus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio laughs to herself and puts in her earbuds and takes out her textbook as the bus starts moving. Agatha takes a seat across from Wanda with a huff. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell made you so late?” Wanda whispers from across the hall. Agatha sends her an exhaustive look and rubs her temple to get rid of the growing headache. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was up all night f- uh, studying.” Agatha catches herself from ranting angrily about Rio’s amazing ability to put all of the coaches' anger onto her. Wanda’s eyes widen and a smile spreads across her lips as she moves to the edge of her bench. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You were up all night doing what? </span><em><span>Fucking</span></em><span>?” Wanda asks knowingly. Agatha sighs and pulls off her sweatshirt, rushing around her apartment to pack for the trip made her hotter than hell, tossing it aside and taking a deep breath. She knows she is in for </span><em><span>another</span></em><span> line of questioning from the redhead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda, I need at least an hour of sleep before I can handle your questions. Please-” Agatha moves to put her headphones on when Wanda stops her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whose shirt is that?” Wanda asks curiously, eyes narrowing on the piece of clothing. Agatha’s brow furrows and her eyes drop down to her shirt.</span></p><p> </p><p><b><em>Eastview Community College</em></b></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s heart drops all the way down to her stomach to shrivel up with anxiety. Of all the shirts in Rio's dorm she just had to pick possibly the worst shirt to wear in front of her best friend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my God, Agatha,” Wanda looks absolutely appalled by the thoughts in her head and Agatha is frozen in fear that she has given away her deepest secret, “Are you fucking a guy from </span><em><span>Eastview</span></em><span>?” Wanda makes the word sound so…dirty, like it left a bad taste in her mouth just to say it. It reminds Agatha that they grew up in similar ways but only Wanda has chosen to adopt her parents' classist ideology. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Admittedly, she is a little relieved. Agatha assumed she was going to drop Rio's name. Part of her cringed with shame and anxiety at her secret getting out but on the other hand…being </span><em><span>out</span></em><span> with Rio wouldn't be that bad, right? But, Wanda didn't connect the dots. Not yet. Agatha forces herself to breathe and relax back against the seat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eastview Community College isn't a thing anymore, Wanda. Half of their students transferred to Westview, remember? What's the big deal?” Agatha writes off her concern but Wanda doesn't let it go.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are! Does Rio know him? Is he hot? Come on, give me details! You know I live vicariously through you.” Wanda whines and begs but Agatha just shakes her head, heart jumping at the mention of the second string pitcher. She catches dark eyes watching her over the seats and fights off a blush. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Then Agatha spots Jen who has raised her head from the redhead’s commotion and feels her heart drop at the way she </span><em><span>stares</span></em><span> so knowingly and mysterious. Wanda might be oblivious to the oddly small men's shirt that smells heavily of feminine scents but </span><em><span>Jen</span></em><span>… Agatha swiftly pulls her sweatshirt back on despite the heat of embarrassment boiling her alive under the material.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda,” Agatha hisses and glares at the woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give me </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> - one little detail - and I'll leave you alone for the rest of the drive.” Wanda barters, looking at her friend hopefully. Agatha sighs, her tongue poking into the side of her cheek as she thinks over the offer. She groans softly and pushes from the side of the bus, putting her at the edge of the bench only a few inches from the redhead who waits eagerly for her long awaited information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha thinks about the last time Wanda called her out for her sexual adventures and how possessive Rio reacted to her response. It's tempting to rile the other woman once again, but her sleep deprived mind can't think of anything but the truth. So, she tweaks it, just a little, to make it sound like she is sleeping with a man and not Rio - as unappealing as that is to her now - she is very convincing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I came five times last night - </span><em><span>five</span></em><span>. The third one literally took my breath away and made my legs shake. I don't think I fell asleep until four in the morning. He was </span><em><span>insatiable</span></em><span>.” Agatha gushes quietly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda is more than pleased, a plethora of questions on the tip of her tongue. Agatha gives her a slight glare and holds up her hand to keep the questions from spewing out. The redhead presses her lips tightly together with great effort. Agatha pointedly places the headphones over her ears and moves back to the inside of her seat. She falls asleep smelling eucalyptus and bergamot.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha jolts awake at a harsh bump in the road. A groan makes its way to her lips and she rips off the headphones to see how far they've made it. To Agatha's surprise, they've already arrived in Salem. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Catching up on sleep?” Wanda teases from the other side of the bus. Agatha sends her a half-hearted glare and stretches while glancing around the bus. The majority of the women are either sleeping or talking with one another. Everyone except Rio who has taken up the entire back of the bus to study. Their eyes meet over the seats. Rio sends a wink that makes butterflies flutter in Agatha's chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Listen up ladies.” Herb gathers everyone's attention, standing up at the front of the bus with a clipboard in his hand. “When we arrive at the hotel I will get your keys from the front desk and Sharon will split you up with your roommates.” Wanda looks excitedly at Agatha, both of them having been paired as roommates since their very first visiting game. A part of Agatha, the insanely horny and pathetic side of her, has hopes to be paired with Rio, as unlikely as that is. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dinner will be provided then you will be on your way to sleep - and I do mean </span><em><span>sleep</span></em><span>. Curfew is at nine o'clock sharp and if I catch anyone out of their room there will be hell to pay for the whole team when we return to Westview.” Herb pauses, pinning every player with a stern look that they all take very seriously. Well, most of them, Rio is already wondering if there is a pool at this hotel. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They arrive at the hotel, all of them hauling their gear and overnight bags into the lobby. Agatha is unsurprisingly paired with Wanda as her roommate. Rio is paired with Darcy, thankfully, knowing the second string catcher is happy to play into Rio's mischievous ideas. Dinner is quick, the rumor of their secret pool party spreading between dinner tables, the majority of the team either tired or eager to get horizontal after eating. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio tosses her bags onto one of the beds and slips out of the room with Darcy following close behind, their plan to find the pool already in the works. Agatha spots the pair sneaking down the hallway and feels the familiar little ball of jealousy burning in her chest to see Rio so </span><em><span>friendly</span></em><span> with someone else. She covers the ice bucket with a lid and clears her throat, pinning the two women with a disappointed look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you two up to? It's almost curfew.” Agatha asks, the two women spinning on their heels to look at their captain very guiltily. Well, Darcy looks guilty, Rio looks thrilled to get caught by Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just taking a walk, Captain.” Rio answers shortly. Agatha narrows her eyes on the raven haired woman when she catches the lie. But, Rio is Rio and she stands strong with a convincing smile. Agatha knows better. The Captain turns her stern look to the other woman and waits expectantly. Darcy shifts on her feet, avoids piercing blue eyes but she never had the ability to survive Agatha’s deadly glare.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Darcy caves, “We're looking for the pool.” Rio sighs with a sidelong glance at the catcher.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sighs and spins her glare right back to Rio. “You just can't help but be a bad influence, can you?” Rio looks at her with a shit eating grin and shrugs her shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wanna have some fun, sue me.” Rio responds sarcastically, spinning around to continue on her search for the pool. Agatha reaches out her hand and grabs Rio's wrist to tug her back around, surprising the taller woman at the roughness of her touch. Brown eyes darken with the move, threatening to throw Agatha off track, but with Darcy watching them, she can't afford to be weak right now. Agatha is their captain and Rio needs to respect that.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you get caught, the whole team gets punished.” Agatha mutters. Rio takes a breath and fixes the shorter woman with an understanding look. She knows what Agatha is thinking and recognizes the Westview Witches Softball Captain making an appearance for a strong stance against no-nonsense but she needs Agatha right now. The team needs to have some fun.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get it - I do, </span><em><span>but</span></em><span> think of it as a team morale event.” Rio tries to persuade the woman, Darcy still shifting on her feet beside her, Agatha’s grip loosens, “We won't get caught.” Rio promises. Agatha spots the genuine confidence in her eyes and finally releases her wrist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine, but I'm coming with you.” Agatha leaves no room for argument as she stalks back to her room, “As soon as anything gets out of hand-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>If</span></em><span> anything gets out of hand, we will return to our rooms.” Rio jumps in with a triumphant smile. Agatha rolls her eyes and swipes her card to get into the room. Wanda hesitates to jump on board with the plan, mostly because it's Rio's plan, but one snarky comment about the redhead being lame from Darcy has Wanda jumping to agree to defend her ego. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Soon enough, a handful of the women are tiptoeing past the coaches rooms and scrambling into the elevator. Finding the pool was easy, getting past the locked door is the hard part. Wanda shakes the handle after swiping her card for entrance. Locked.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What's your bright idea now, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>?” Wanda asks, smug and crossing her arms over her chest with an annoying sense of satisfaction at the other pitcher's failure. Rio smiles and steps closer to the redhead.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have my ways,” Rio whispers mysteriously, leaving the group outside of the pool door and walking a few doors down and knocking softly. Rio smiles at the young woman on the other side of the door, the same woman who checked the team in and couldn't stop looking at Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hi, I’m Rio,” Rio husks softly, smiling a little wider and offering her hand. The young brunette blushes with attention and takes her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sarah.” The woman responds nervously, eyes bright and intrigued as she looks at Rio, quickly falling for her charm. Agatha scoffs and rolls her eyes. She knows Rio is flirting to get access to the pool but Agatha is a jealous woman. She bites her tongue and adverts her eyes, refusing to see Rio flirting with another woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And just like that, the reputation of Rio Vidal crosses state lines.” Jen whispers with the group, earning quite a few laughs. It makes Agatha’s blood boil. A few seconds pass and Rio is returning to the door with another key card. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We already tried-” Wanda doesn’t get to finish. Rio flashes the card in front of the reader and raises an eyebrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You were saying?” Rio asks sarcastically, feigning confusion. Wanda sighs, sending the pitcher a glare as she pushes into the pool room. Rio smirks triumphantly until she sees Agatha, not even sparing her a glare but instead ignoring her entirely. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio flounders for a witty comment or a snarky remark but she doesn’t know what to do about </span><em><span>this</span></em><span>. Agatha has never ignored her before. Fought with her, yelled at her, fucked her, sure but never ignored. She swallows roughly and follows her inside. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Small problem ladies,” Alice mutters as she looks around the pool room, drawing everyone’s attention, “Swimsuits?” The second baseman points out, a few of the girls groaning. Rio scoffs and rips off her shirt to toss it aside, her pants quickly following. Agatha feels a blush crawling up her neck at the pitcher exposing herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus Christ, Rio, do you always strip to get what you want?” Wanda hisses, her eyes betraying her as they skate down the pitcher’s body. Agatha can’t help that her own eyes are helplessly trained to explore every inch of Rio’s body on instinct.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She can strip for me anytime she wants,” Jen mutters under her breath right behind Agatha. Jealously pools in the pit of her stomach to boil along with her blood. She spots more than one bruise or hickey that </span><em><span>she</span></em><span> left last night and feels herself cooling down. For now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you all prudes or just Wanda?” Rio jests, diving into the water with grace. The rest of the girls are quick to follow, stripping out of their clothes down to their underwear and jumping into the pool. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know you’re not a prude, Harkness,” Rio whispers, swimming to the edge of the pool and crossing her arms on top of the concrete. Agatha avoids looking at her arms and how muscular and toned they look in the low light. Rio’s dark brown eyes aren’t any better, filled with dirty thoughts and suggestive glances down her body. Her feet shift once she realizes how good the pitcher looks below her, heat flaring between her thighs at the sight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My lingerie costs more than my gear. I’m not getting in the water so it can get ruined.” Agatha responds tightly, fixing the woman with a glare. Rio tilts her head slightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought you liked ruining your pretty little panties around me?” Rio’s voice is soft and oh so seductive, just quiet enough to keep their conversation private from the women at the other end of the pool. Normally Agatha would be completely drawn into her orbit by now. Except all she can think about is Jen and Alice’s appreciation of Rio’s body and the pitcher’s annoying ability to flirt with any woman on planet earth. Agatha shouldn’t be so jealous - she shouldn’t be so possessive - not over Rio who certainly isn’t hers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ruining my La Perla panties around you at least ends with </span><em><span>some</span></em><span> satisfaction.” Agatha retorts, taking a seat on one of the lounge chairs, solidifying her reluctance to join. Rio is offended. She narrows her eyes, wishing the brunette was being more forthcoming about what has upset her so much, but Rio knows the woman won’t give up the stubborn act so easily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Some</span></em><span>?” Rio bites out. Agatha smirks, enjoying getting under the raven haired woman’s skin for once. “Why did you come down here if you weren’t going to join?” Rio questions curiously, knowing full and well that Agatha could’ve washed her hands of the entire situation if she had wanted to. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you. To make sure nothing gets out of hand.” Agatha answers dryly. Rio studies her for a few more seconds, trying so hard to figure her out and being frustrated that she can't for once, before being called over to the other women for a game of chicken. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Luckily for Agatha the women are tiring out quickly because there is only so much she can take of Jen and Alice fawning over Rio and her body. The hickeys and bruises get pointed out but Rio gives them vague answers, always looking at Agatha afterwards because she knows what she's thinking - she knows what Agatha is remembering from last night. The way they ravaged each other's bodies until early morning because there was no more hesitation between them. They were both diving head first into whatever this is between them. That doesn't excuse the pitcher's relentless flirting. Agatha is sure even her ears are red with a mixture of jealousy and anger.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>A few of the women call it a night, gathering their clothes and sneaking back to their rooms with a strong warning from their Captain to be quiet and discreet or face her wrath alongside their Coaches. Wanda urges Agatha to walk back with her but the brunette waves her off with the self assigned task of chaperone, refusing to leave before everyone is gone. Darcy is one of the last women to leave, stepping through the door with a curious look towards Rio and Agatha staring each other down from across the pool. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get in,” Rio prompts as soon as the door clicks shut, slowly making her way closer to the edge of the pool where Agatha sits on the lounge chair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No.” Clipped and tight, Agatha’s tone refuses to reveal anything but anger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It's just us, Ags. Get in, relax a little.” Rio jests, leaning against the concrete with her arms to support her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you not to call me that,” Agatha growls. Rio smiles at the reaction, pleased to get another emotion out of the brunette. </span><em><span>Annoyance</span></em><span>. Possibly one of her favorite emotions the catcher exudes right alongside jealous and desperate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come relax with me.” The words sound so sultry and seductive. It takes everything Agatha has not to pull her thighs together for friction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You must have a hearing problem Vidal,” Agatha hisses, wanting to leave, even debating on walking out that minute if it didn't leave Rio alone with that front desk bitch around the corner, “I'm not getting in the pool and ruining a perfectly good set of La Perla lingerie.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn't have the slightest clue about what that means but she will say the woman looks damn good in her matching lace bra and thong sets. It must be something she takes pride in. Rio pushes up from the ledge so her hips are level with the lip of the pool and leans forward. As expected, Agatha’s gaze drops to admire the view. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then take everything off.” Agatha laughs, truly laughs and even though it is at Rio's disgrace she loves to hear it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am not skinny dipping with you, Rio.” Agatha stands then, too many images flashing through her mind to stay still and </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> rub her thighs together. Rio pressing her naked body into her underwater, their lips fighting to lay claim to one another, hands- </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm sure </span><em><span>Sarah</span></em><span> would be willing.” Rio is playing with fire, she is well aware. Agatha stops in her tracks, blazing blue eyes looking at the pitcher who smirks mischievously at her own diabolical words.   </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The girl at the front desk?” Agatha asks incredulously because surely Rio is talking about someone else she has hopefully known for more than five minutes, “Are you that desperate to fuck me? You've resorted to baiting me with fucking a woman you met three seconds ago?” Agatha asks, unable to comprehend what Rio's plan is. Honestly, Rio doesn't even know. All she knows is she wants Agatha writhing with pleasure and gasping for breath for her. Anyone and everyone else can go screw themselves.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I am.” Rio answers confidently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are </span><em><span>what</span></em><span>?” Agatha hisses, angrier than before, frustrated and dying for a straight-forward answer. Rio tilts her head slightly before reaching behind her, flicking the clasp on her bra. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am desperate to fuck you, Agatha Harkness,” Rio breathes out, tossing the sopping wet bra towards the other woman's feet. Agatha stands still, shocked and entranced by the confidence and vulnerability Rio has exhibited. Her eyes drop to admire perky breasts and tight nipples. Rio's naked body is all the more tempting now that Agatha has a taste for it. Her eyes flicker over her shoulder at the lone door for the indoor pool, the glass fogged from the temperature difference but still able to be peered into. This is such a bad idea so why in the world is she actually thinking of doing it? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No one will see us. I have the only key in our group. Trust me.” Rio adds on hopefully, watching Agatha fight an internal battle. The brunette looks back to the seductress, the siren in the pool and knows exactly why she is going to do what she is about to do. Because Rio, the lesbian demon of Westview, has and is choosing her, Agatha Harkness, over everyone else. She flirts and charms but she keeps coming back to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What if </span><em><span>Sarah</span></em><span> decides to come looking for you?” Agatha asks, slowly peeling her shirt over her head to lay on the lounge chair. Rio smiles wider, relieved and excited. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then she can watch while I fuck you.” Rio's answer is so blunt and shocking that Agatha thinks she is joking and lets out a scoff. Her pants are added to the pile. Rio isn’t joking. She rakes her eyes over the dark green lace lingerie and feels her mouth watering at the sight. So, maybe not getting in the pool wearing expensive, mouth watering lingerie was a good call. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You wouldn't,” Agtha teases, laughing softly as her lingerie is carefully added to her pile of clothes. Rio moves with her like a shadow towards the steps, shucking off her underwear and tossing it in the same vague direction as her bra. Her fingers itch to dig into sweet soft flesh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know me well enough,” Rio begins, chivalrously offering the woman her hand as she steps into the water, eyes scouring every inch of her body once, then again and again, “Do you think I would stop for any other reason besides your own well being?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The question leaves Agatha pliable as she thinks, scouring her brain for any other reason Rio would stop fucking her in the middle of the act and comes up with nothing. In the meantime, Rio tugs her close, one hand slipping around her back to pull their bodies flush. The other hand slipped up her body with teasing fingers to cup her jaw. Agatha melts into the contact, her own hands finding purchase on Rio's naked hips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Agatha answers softly. Rio walks them backwards, as far away from the door they can manage without venturing too far into the deep end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I wouldn't. Do you know why?” Rio questions gently, pressing her own back into the side of the pool, giving the brunette the freedom and choice to leave. The opportunity to watch the doors despite their cover. Because even with just their chests pressed together Rio can feel how fast her heart is beating. She knows this is making her nervous but she plans to take all of that away and leave her with only one thing on her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head in response. She fights the instinct to keep looking at the door. A multitude of scenarios playing through her mind. </span><em><span>Sarah</span></em><span> catches them, sending them back to their rooms and has a very uncomfortable talk with Herb. Wanda or Darcy return to check on them, spotting them through fogged glass and telling the rest of the team. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha digs her fingers into Rio's hips, wanting to run, and yet, Agatha loves it, the thought of being caught already giving her a thrill. The thought of being caught and Rio continuing to fuck her in front of whoever dared to interrupt them even more so. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because I've waited all day to touch you.” Rio whispers, settling back against the cold concrete, spreading her legs slightly and guiding Agatha to straddle her thigh. The first touch makes the catcher's breath hitch, her hands moving to Rio's shoulders to ground herself a little more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I couldn't study on the bus because I couldn't stop thinking about how good you taste coming on my tongue.” Rio mutters, moving her hands to wander the woman's body. Agatha takes a sharp breath in, watching Rio as her eyes darken and she takes what she wants.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sounds terrible for you,” Agatha teases, arching into her touch when both hands cup her breasts. Her hands are warm, hotter than the water surrounding them and Agatha finally feels her muscles relaxing under her touch. Rio smiles and releases a soft laugh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was excruciating, really.” Rio plays into the tease. She passes her thumbs over her hard nipples and relishes in the soft moan she hears in response. “I almost asked Sharon to switch roommates - maybe I could have you all to myself.” Rio drops her lips forward, placing a soft kiss to her collarbone. Agatha bites her bottom lip to contain a smile, just the thought of Rio easily convincing the nice older coach to switch rooms is entertaining. She rolls her hips forward and grinds into her thigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then I thought about how hot, wet, and needy you sound wrapped around my fingers and muffling those sweet sounds of yours is </span><em><span>unacceptable</span></em><span>.” Rio whispers the word tightly, as if just speaking of it is a disgrace. On cue, Agatha releases a louder moan and makes Rio smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly like that,” Rio hums happily, her mouth kissing up her neck to reach her ear. She drops her hand between them to offer her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“To expand on your question earlier,” Rio slides one finger inside of her, basking in the sweet moan that sounds in her ear, “I am desperate to fuck you - every day, all day. I can't get you out of my head,” Rio husks into her ear, nibbling at her ear lobe as she begins thrusting her finger. Agatha shivers with the passion in Rio's voice, wrapping her arms around her shoulders to keep their bodies flush.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How desperate?” Agatha whispers between moans, bucking her hips for more. Rio gives it to her, no teasing or light touches, she feels two fingers sliding into her with ease and delving deep. Agatha moans deeper and earns a rough hand squeezing her tit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Desperate enough to wonder how I could get you to the back of the bus.” Rio answers honestly, grunting as her free hand drops down and wraps her arm around Agatha’s waist and lifts her in the water. Agatha gasps softly, wrapping her legs around Rio's waist and inadvertently opening herself up to take her fingers deeper. A moan rings in her ears but she's not sure if it was her or Rio - maybe both. Rio's hot palm presses into her pussy, crushing her clit as her hips pick up the pace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why? Tell me.” Agatha demands, a fantasy playing out in her mind while Rio fucks her. While Rio talks about fucking her. She's panting for breath now, fucking herself on those talented fingers, and letting her eyes slip closed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So I could slip my hand into those pretty little panties of yours and make you lose your mind in front of the entire team.” Rio growls, curling her fingers and pumping harder. Agatha's teeth dig into her bottom lip to stop an honest to God scream from ripping past her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The fantasy plays in the back of her mind like a movie. Rio slipping her hand into Agatha’s leggings in the back of a dark bus, her fingers teasing but determined. Agatha trying to hold in her moans so desperately that her lip bleeds from how hard she bites into it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck - you're gonna make me come.” Agatha whimpers, chokes it off with a moan. Rio groans and gently slips in a third finger just to hear Agatha release the loudest moan yet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That's right, that's what I want. Let me hear you.” Rio whispers, pushing through the burning in her muscles when she feels velvet walls flutter around her fingers. Agatha feels her body tensing with anticipation, the orgasm building inside of her so close to crashing down on her like a tsunami. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The problem with that little idea?” Rio husks into her ear, pushing in deeper with every thrust, “I wouldn't be able to hear those sweet sounds you're about to give me right now</span><em><span>.</span></em><span>” Agatha groans, burying her face in Rio's neck to muffle her sounds just to avoid any unwanted attention, nails digging into flesh anywhere she can find purchase as she meets every thrust with a desperate jerk of her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio,</span></em><span>” Agatha grits out, breathless and moaning as her orgasm finally snaps. Her thighs shaking and tightening around her waist, bearing down on the fingers inside of her and the palm against her clit. She rides Rio's fingers and creates waves of water to splash against the pool wall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, you're so tight.” Rio groans, reveling in the walls desperately clamping around her fingers to keep her inside. Her thrusts don't slow, her mouth making a mark just below the brunette's collarbone, and whispers sweet nothings in her ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans deep and loud, keeping her hips as close to the pitcher as she can while she rides through the shock of her orgasm. Rio supports her, kissing her neck and catching her own breath as she slows her thrusts. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Relaxed?” Rio teases softly, licking up the brunette's neck before nipping at her earlobe. Agatha shivers and groans, easily overstimulated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha hisses with a soft short chuckle, scrambling to get one hand between them to grip Rio's wrist. The pitcher chuckles softly but swiftly pulls out her fingers as delicately as possible.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I've got you.” Rio gently runs her hands over her trembling thighs. Agatha moves her feet back to the pool floor but keeps her arms wrapped around strong shoulders to keep her shaking limbs steady while she pants for breath. She keeps her face buried, holding on for a few more seconds than she probably should. A comfortable calm settling over them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We should get back,” Rio mutters reluctantly, knowing that they've already been lucky enough, leading Agatha from her neck. The brunette doesn't remove herself so easily, lifting her head enough to catch Rio's lips. A soft sigh leaves Agatha, a similar sound echoing from the pitcher. Her left hand slides into dark wet hair and uses her leverage to control the kiss, flicking her tongue across plump lips for entrance and deepening the kiss in seconds. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans softly, undeniably aware of her own need flaring between her thighs. Her hands squeeze and roam soft skin to swallow the moans that leave Agatha’s mouth, pushing them towards dangerous territory. With a lot of discipline and restraint, Rio pulls away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're going to get us in trouble,” Rio jests. Agatha scoffs and rolls her eyes, peeing herself away from the magnetic woman in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If we get in trouble, I'm throwing you under the bus.” Agatha walks out of the pool with Rio trailing behind her, a bright smile on her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have no doubt in that, Captain.” They quickly get dressed in their dry clothes. Rio decides against wearing her sopping wet underwear much to Agatha's amusement. Just as they leave the pool room Rio snags the access card from her back pocket.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just give me a second-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I've got it,” Agatha says quickly, taking the card from Rio's fingers and making her way towards the office door. Rio smiles and watches the brunette knock on the door, waiting to see how this plays out. When it opens, Sarah is clearly shocked to see Agatha, not Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks for letting us have a good time, </span><em><span>Sarah</span></em><span>.” Agatha keeps the fake smile plastered on her face and the faux appreciation in her voice. Sarah blinks in shock, lips parting as her eyes dart to Rio standing behind Agatha. She takes the card and snaps her jaw shut, the embarrassment settling red on her cheeks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha turns around and begins walking back to Rio, taking her hand and leading her towards the elevators. The satisfaction of knocking down a play for Rio's hand and taking the woman as her own gives her a rush of excitement. A rush of energy that leaves her unable to think straight. Riding off the high of her orgasm and her inflated ego, Agatha pulls Rio into the empty elevator and pushes her against the wall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is more than happy to be Agatha’s outlet of energy. The doors close and the catcher pounces, wanting one last taste of her lips before they split for their rooms. Agatha groans with the rough crash of their lips, hands tangling in the still wet hair of her partner and tilting her head for more access. Rio makes herself pliable and only uses her hands to assert her own desires. One hand dropping to the brunette's ass and the other slipping underneath her shirt to scratch at her back. Agatha retaliated with her own hand dropping to Rio’s chest, cupping her breast with a rough hand and thumbing her cold, tight nipple through the material of her shirt. It has the desired effect, Rio gasps softly in surprise, lips parting and Agatha taking full advantage with a smirk, tongue sliding past shocked lips to assert her control. It turns Rio into mush. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The elevator dings.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha pushes away and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. She is prepared to walk out of the elevator, leaving the pitcher struggling to gather herself like she had done to her so many times before. That doesn't happen. Agatha stops in her tracks, physically unable to get past Herb standing in the doorway. The older man crosses his arms and gives both women a disapproving look. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Fuck.</span></em></p>

<p><span>“What time is curfew?” Herb questions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nine,” Rio answers, parting her lips to continue only for the older man to raise his hand for silence. Her lips close and her eyes glance toward the brunette at her side. Agatha stands still, eyes burning into the ground and jaw tight. Anxiety and guilt eating her from the inside out. She can handle getting caught by Herb past curfew, it’s wondering what he saw when the elevator doors opened that is eating her alive. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly, but you two decided to go for a swim instead?” Herb asks in confusion, looking them over and noticing their obviously wet hair, “Is the pool even open?” He wonders aloud, brow furrowed in thought. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It won’t happen again, Coach.” Agatha keeps her voice strong and raises her eyes to finally look at the man. He comes to sand squarely in front of the catcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It shouldn’t have happened </span><em><span>at all</span></em><span>, Harkness,” Herb points out sternly, releasing a harsh sigh. He runs his hand over his face in exasperation. “I should bench you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach, this was my idea. I dragged Agatha into it-” Rio speaks up, refusing to let Agatha get blamed for her scheme. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t ask, Vidal. I will deal with you later. Get to your room.” Herb snaps back, nodding his head down the hall with a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach,” Rio begins but she doesn’t get far. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha says quickly, sharp and biting, but still refusing to look at the pitcher. Guilt fills Rio’s gut like cement. She clenches her jaw shut and releases a reluctant sigh before walking back to her room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb relaxes a little when Rio is gone, softening his edges for his team captain, “Is that true?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Doesn’t matter, does it?” Agatha asks, raising an eyebrow. Herb narrows his eyes slightly to study his captain, tilting his head slightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I guess not.” He responds gently, pinning her with an inquisitive look, one that makes her skin crawl. “Get some sleep.” Herb relents, rubbing his own eyes as he begins the walk back to his room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach,” Agatha calls out, waiting for him to turn around, “This is on me - just me. Bench me if you need to but the team has nothing to do with it.” Herb takes a second to digest her words but eventually nods his head, turning back toward his room. Agatha sighs, closing her eyes to take a deep breath. She goes through every second of the elevator through her mind, regretting her reckless actions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What took you so long?” Wanda asks when Agatha steps into their room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, nothing. I was just waiting for the rest of the girls to get done having their fun.” Agatha excuses quickly, kicking off her shoes and walking towards her bag. Wanda pushes herself up in bed, already showered and dressed for bed in a matching silk pajama set. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All the girls came back already.” Wanda points out suspiciously. Agatha sighs and sends the other woman an exhaustive look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not everyone.” She replies swiftly. The redhead rolls her eyes, the look on her face immediately turning sour at the thought of one team mate in particular. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course it was, Rio. Did you see how quickly she took off her clothes?” Wanda grumbles, grabbing her phone to bury herself in social media while complaining. It’s Agatha’s turn to roll her eyes. “Do you think she is going to hookup with that one chick? The hotel lady- uh, Sandy? Sam?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda, I really don’t give a shit. Rio can do what she wants.” Agatha hisses, grabbing her toiletry bag and searching for her pajamas. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She certainly acts like it,” Wanda agrees quickly, her attention coming back to the brunette. “I swear she is desperate for attention </span><em><span>all the time</span></em><span>. It is pathetic-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda,” Agatha grits out sternly, finally grabbing her clothes and spinning on the pitcher with a glare. “I don’t know what your problem with Rio is but you better figure it out. She’s our team mate.” She yells, shocking Wanda who stares at her with wide eyes. Those eyes harden quickly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sick of you defending her, Agatha. You’re my best friend - my catcher. Would it kill you to be on my side for once?” Wanda hisses back. Agatha can’t contain her laugh of disbelief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your side? Wanda, your side consists of complaining about Rio every ten seconds.” Agatha laughs as she shakes her head, spotting the flash of red in the woman’s eyes and feeling more anger building from it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Believe it or not, Rio is a good person and a damn good ball player. Most importantly, she is a part of this team. I don’t want to hear another word of this, you got it?” Agatha bites out with a glare. Wanda is so desperate for a competition with Rio that she is struggling to keep her skill up. Agatha can tell better than anyone that Wanda is trying too hard and the insecurity of losing to Rio has her pitches more erratic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda glares right back, tinged with red and daring the Scarlet Witch to be unleashed. Agatha doesn’t wait for an answer, storming off to the bathroom. She turns the water hot, stepping under the water fall and letting her skin burn with the heat of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha closes her eyes, playing the moment over and over in her head. She wants to believe Herb didn’t see anything. It didn’t seem like he did. Does it matter? Agatha shouldn’t have let it get this far. She should’ve told Rio no so many times tonight. No to finding the pool. No to fucking in the pool. No to sneaking around at all. She should have had more restraint and discipline to keep their agreement behind closed doors.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Part of her wants to find a solution. Something to keep whatever it is that they have between them theirs. She doesn’t see it, can’t find a way out. The other part of her knows that they have run their course, haven’t they? They’ve almost been caught by someone much worse than one of their team mates. They need to be done. The emotion rises in her throat but she chokes it down. When the chlorine is washed off of her body and her anger has lowered to a simmer, she gets out of the shower. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Getting into bed feels like taking a sleeping pill. Between traveling, an orgasm and the anger rolling through her system she knocks out like a light. So much so that the alarm that comes early in the morning has her struggling to open her eyes and get out of bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda stays silent as they get ready for the day, the tension building thickly between them but Agatha has no desire to address it. Rio studies Agatha at breakfast, noticing the hard wall she has up and the reluctance to spare anyone anything more than a glance, including Rio. Probably especially Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach, can we talk for a second?” Rio asks once breakfast is over and the team is returning to their rooms to collect their gear. Herb waits for the rest of the girls to file into the elevator before bringing Rio aside. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Make it quick, Vidal. We’re on the bus in ten.” Herb says quickly, fixing her with a stern look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Last night was </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> idea - </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> fault. Don’t blame Agatha or the team.” Rio says quickly, getting the confession off her chest to keep it from eating her alive. Last night was filled with restless sleep. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s interesting. Harkness told me the same story. Who should I believe?” Herb questions, arms crossing over his chest and disbelief striking across his features. Rio sighs because of course Agatha tried to take the blame. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha is a good captain and she’s trying to take the hit for me but I promise it wasn’t her.” Rio says strongly. Herb stares at her in contemplation but eventually nods his head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll think on it,” Herb says shortly. Rio feels a little bit of the guilt leeching from her with the agreement. She returns back to her room to gather her gear and walks with Darcy to the elevator to get on the bus. Agatha feels her body tense with Rio’s presence, shifting her gear bag higher onto her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning Harkness,” Darcy greets. Agatha glances at the two women, avoiding Rio’s eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lewis,” Agatha returns the greeting, looking hopefully towards the slowly moving elevator, “Vidal.” The other woman’s name leaves her lips with a tightness she doesn’t mean to use. She always had a hard time controlling her voice in situations like this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Captain,” Rio says, staring at the back of the woman’s head in the hopes it will make her meet her eyes. No such luck. Agatha is avoiding her like the plague. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Darcy isn’t stupid, she notices the tension between her team mates with ease and puts the puzzle pieces together, at least slightly. Based on the tension between the two women in the pool and the scary brooding Rio that returned to the room last night, they must’ve had a fight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just as the elevator doors open, Darcy speaks up, “Uh, I think I left my water bottle in the room. I’ll meet you down there.” Agatha steps into the elevator, eyes flashing with annoyance as her only buffer between her and the persistent pitcher leaves. She doesn’t want to do it yet. Not yet. Rio steps inside beside her. Agatha bites back a groan and smashes the button for the lobby. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t say a word.” Agatha hisses, spinning on Rio and finally looking her in the eyes. She pushes forward, expecting Rio to move backwards but simply meeting her toe-to-toe instead. “Last night was…” Agatha trails off, her mind getting distracted when she remembers how she pushed Rio into the wall and stole her breath with a kiss, how they got caught. She remembers that it was her fault and gets her mind back on track. Rio parts her lips to speak but Agatha continues first. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Last night was a mistake but it’s over- </span><em><span>we are over</span></em><span>. Get your head in the game.” Her tone is as sharp as the stinging disregard. It pains her to say it, calling them a mistake and ending whatever they have, but she needs to keep Rio at a distance so she can think. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mistake</span></em><span>?” Rio’s eyes flash with vulnerability and confusion, maybe even desperation. Last night was a close call but the worst that happened was getting caught past curfew. Suddenly, Rio can’t even talk to the brunette - God forbid they get caught speaking to each other.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels her throat tightening with the urge to take back her words. Because she’s seen Rio in a lot of different ways but being vulnerable and hurt isn’t an emotion she thought she would see, let alone cause. Agatha is almost drawn to the other woman, back into her orbit, before brown eyes hardened with Rio’s typical indifferent demeanor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Captain.” Rio feels too much, wants too much, regrets too much. She pushes it down, chokes on the emotion in her throat and pushes past Agatha, knocking a shoulder into her captain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels the muscles in her jaw straining tightly to stay closed that an ache seeps into them. She follows after the pitcher, getting onto the bus but passing by Wanda who sends a glare her way. Rio avoids her eyes at all costs from the back of the bus. Agatha decides on a seat at the front. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb gives one hell of a pep talk, lighting a fire under each one of his players but two. When they reach the field they take over the visitor’s dug out and begin their stretches and warm-up routines. When Agatha returns to the dug out, Herb hands Agatha her catcher’s mask. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not punishing the team for your little clandestine pool visit. Gear up and give ‘em hell.” Herb says strongly, grabbing her arm gently before she leaves. “Harkness, this doesn’t mean you’re off the hook.” He looks her in the eyes, waiting for acknowledgment. Agatha gives it in a small nod. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Coach.” Agatha says strongly. Herb nods back and focuses on the rest of the team. Agatha catches Rio’s eyes but the stone wall is back in place and she looks away without an inkling of emotion. Agatha hates it with a passion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The Salem Seven is one of their biggest rivals. The Westview Witches have beaten them three years running, ever since Agatha joined the team. Needless to say, they hold grudges and they are more than happy to show it. The first six innings are a battle for the top, each team matching out for out, point for point, three to three at the end of the sixth inning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is tucked behind home base, calling fastballs, curves and whatever else she can to get this woman off her base. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You look mighty comfortable on your knees, baby.” The catcher from the Salem Seven, nicknamed Fox, loves to taunt and talk. Agatha hates her, always has, but she never engages. It's a fucking super power to have thick skin like she does. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda sends a blazing fastball over the base and into Agatha’s mitt. The batter sighs in disappointment at the missed hit. It lands as a strike but Agatha catches the painful wince in the pitcher’s face. She’s pushing herself too hard. She’s been covering up her pain for the last inning but it’s showing loud and clear now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Time out, Ump.” Agatha calls for a time out to the umpire, starting to walk toward the pitching mound. Wanda rolls her eyes and shakes her head but Agatha keeps walking. Rio stands from the bench and wraps her fingers around the linked fence.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re hitting your limit,” Agatha begins softly, wiping the sweat from her brow. Wanda scoffs and fixes Agatha with a harsh glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m not.” Wanda hisses back. The catcher sighs, sending a pointed glance toward the dugout, Herb already on his way to the pitcher’s mound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are, Wanda. You’ve been hurting since the last inning.” Agatha points out, turning to Herb as he approaches. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s the plan ladies?” Herb asks, already suspicious of Wanda. He knows his players, Agatha wouldn’t have stopped for nothing and Wanda would do anything to stay on the field. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s struggling,” Agatha says softly, glancing at the redhead who seethes at the answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine. She’s being dramatic.” Wanda says quickly, trying to desperately secure her spot as pitcher. Herb studies his pitcher then looks back to the catcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you thinking?” Herb asks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s struggling but-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you thinking?” Herb reiterates stronger, giving the catcher a pointed look. Agatha sighs, glancing at Wanda and shaking her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’ll throw her arm out if she keeps it up. She needs a break.” Agatha mutters gently. Wanda huffs in disbelief, storming off the field and making sure to shoulder into Rio as she enters the dugout. Herb waves the rookie over from the mound. Rio doesn’t hesitate, snagging her glove and jogging out to the mound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is not a reward, do you understand?” Herb says slowly, waiting for a nod from the pitcher, “Make them feel the heat, Vidal.” Rio smirks and steps up to the mound, Agatha coming to place the ball in her glove. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You get three practice pitches. Warm up your arm but don’t show them all your cards, not yet. Got it?” Agatha asks, making eye contact and feeling the heat shift lower in her gut when the dark eyes watching her flash with excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Got it, Captain,” Rio responds happily, forcing a smile for the brunette. Agatha hesitates but leaves the mound to settle back behind home plate. The batter steps back and Rio takes a second to gather herself. </span><em><span>Breathe. Focus. Pitch. </span></em><span>Her fastball doesn’t snap from her hand as quickly as normal. The ball lands a little out of the batter’s box if there were one. The pitcher shakes out her arm for show, playing into Agatha’s plan naturally.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>A few chuckles sound from the opposing team, Fox scoffing and practicing a few swings with ease, it makes Agatha smile. Instead she holds it in, sending the ball back to Rio and completing the last two warm-up pitches before the batter steps back into the box. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Didn’t mean to make your girlfriend run off, Harkness.” Fox teases, waving the tip of the bat over her shoulder to distract the new pitcher, “Although the new girl is fucking hot.” The batter hums softly and Agatha has no doubt the woman is appreciating the pitcher. It rubs her the wrong way but she keeps her lips locked knowing the raven haired woman is about to shut her up anyway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sends her a wicked fast pitch smacking into Agatha’s glove with a resounding snap of leather and the whiff of Fox’s bat filling the silence. Salem’s dugout mumbles their shock as the Westview Witches smile with the pitch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Fox whispers in dread, obviously shaken. Agatha doesn’t bother speaking but she can’t help but let out a small huff of a laugh that leaves her when she stands. Rio smirks when she spots the smile on Agatha's lips even behind the mask. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s hand tingles with the fireballs that light up her glove. She has missed it, ever since she first caught for Rio, catching her pitches are addictive. Rio strikes out the next three batters to conclude the sixth inning and none of them dare speak when they step up to bat, far too worried about striking out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen is first up to bat, one of their powerhouse hitters and easily landing a base. Alice is up to bat and Wanda should be on deck but Herb stands in her way. Agatha watches from the bench, taking off her gear to get ready to bat, feeling the entire dug out fill with tension.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You come off the mound, you rest the whole inning. You know that Maximoff.” Herb says strongly. Wanda glares, angry enough as is to be taken off the mound, but her eyes flashing red with the second restriction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on Coach. I’m fine.” Wanda insists but Herb doesn’t budge and the silence sets her off. “What? Are you going to give Rio my spot now? Huh?” Wanda hisses, moving closer to Herb with a harsh glare. Rio and Agatha share a brief look of surprise and concern. It’s one thing to be pissed off, it’s another to step into the coach’s face. His eyes widened slightly in shock of the woman refusing his direction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If I need to, I will and that will be my god damn discretion as this team’s head Coach.” Herb says strongly, fixing the redhead with a warning glare, “Sit your ass on the bench, Maximoff.” He says sternly. Wanda hesitates, still reeling with anger yet miraculously holding her tongue, but eventually takes a seat on the bench. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re up, Harkness,” Herb says gently, giving Agatha an exhaustive look that speaks far louder than words. </span><em><span>Don’t give me any more shit</span></em><span>. Agatha shucks off the rest of her gear and gratefully takes her bat from Sharon. Wanda scoffs and shakes her head, thinking that Agatha swooping up next in line isn’t much better. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha lands a ball in the outfield, securing the runners on base. Salem's pitcher is struggling, earning more than her fair share of glares from her coaches in the dugout. Nonetheless, they have the bases loaded and two outs under their belt. If Westview Witches are going to score this inning they only have one chance left. Rio uses that to her advantage. And the gossip she got from Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fox, is it?” Rio questions softly as she steps up to bat, not really waiting for a response, “I heard you and your coach over there get real friendly these days.” Fox is easily distracted, her eyes flashing up to look at Rio just as a ball comes in just a little outside of her range. The catcher curses and scrambles to grab the ball from the ground in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut your fucking mouth,” Fox hisses as she stands to throw the ball back to her pitcher. Rio smirks in satisfaction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wow, I didn't think it was true.” Rio mutters in feigned disbelief. The other woman huffs in annoyance, biting her tongue, and dropping back behind the plate. Jen chuckles softly from her spot on third base, admiring the newcomers ability to stir the pot. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don't know what you're talking about bitch.” Fox growls, catching the next outside pitch. Rio chuckles, settling back in to focus on the next pitch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Easy, Tiger. Deny too much and I'll wonder if it's true.” Rio points out swiftly, earning a groan of frustration from the other woman. The pitch comes in hot and fast but Rio reacts smoothly. The crack of the ball hitting the bat is music to her ears. The ball soars through the air deep into the outfield and Rio takes off for first base right as Agatha launches herself towards second. It has potential to be a home run hit and every woman knows it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The Salem Seven scramble to get their bearings, a miscommunication between outfielders leaving them running slow and giving the Westview Witches another point on the board. Jen touches home base, Alice not too far behind. Rio follows step for step after Agatha, even gaining distance on her between third and second base. The brunette touches home base just as the ball reaches the second baseman. Rio ignores Herb's signal to stop at third base. They have a minute left in the game and Rio doesn't want them anywhere near their score. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio corners third base and sprints to home, the ball flying into the catcher out of the corner of her eye. A foot from the plate, Rio drops into a slide, gritting her teeth with the pain that slices up her thigh. A ball filled glove comes down hard against her stomach. The dust settles and Rio prays to the devil her foot is on the plate or she may be in even deeper shit with her head Coach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The umpire calls the play, “Safe!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio smiles up at Fox, who looks like she is ready to murder her. She pushes herself from the ground, coming toe to toe with the woman as she removes her helmet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking bitch,” Fox hisses, glaring daggers into her opponent. Rio refuses to back down, smiling happily at getting under the woman’s skin and hoping for a fight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got something to say, </span><em><span>Tiger</span></em><span>?” Rio taunts easily. Agatha stops her return to the dugout when she notices the pitcher isn't behind her. She swiftly begins walking back to home base when she notices Fox ripping off her catcher’s mask with wild eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It's Fox, you son of a bitch,” The catcher growls, shoving Rio by the shoulders. The umpire begins moving back towards the women to break them up as coaches come out of the dugout. Rio pushes forward again, playing the woman like a fiddle as she keeps her hands to herself, even placing them behind her back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gonna go cry to your </span><em><span>girlfriend</span></em><span> about-” Rio doesn't get to finish, hands grabbing her by the jersey and shoving her harder, trying to take her to the ground. Unfortunately for Fox, Rio has skills in more than just softball. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, fuck,” Agatha mutters in shock as she watches Rio flip her opponent's momentum, bringing Fox to land in the dirt on her back. Fox barely catches her breath before swinging wildly, her fist catching Rio's cheek just as Agatha has her arms wrapped around the pitcher to yank her off of the other woman. Both teams go feral with the fight, the Westview Witches daring to step off the bench if it were for Sharon pleading with the team to stay put. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio lets the strong arms around her waist pull her off of the other woman while she winces. Her back hits a chain linked fence and her eyes focus to see none other than Agatha standing in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus, Rio, what are you thinking?” Agatha hissed in concern, her hands cupping Rio's face and wincing at her quickly reddening cheek. Rio sees the concern on Agatha’s face but it does nothing but create a sharp pain in her chest. She pushes her hands away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not my fault she has anger management issues,” Rio grits out. Agatha’s brow furrows in concern, her hands dropping back to her sides, realizing that she doesn’t get to worry like this, soft and gentle. She can’t be worried anymore than a team captain should. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha turns into the captain she’s supposed to be, “Get back to the dugout and ice your face.” She leaves no room for argument, nudging the pitcher back towards the rest of the team and glaring when the pitcher rips from her grasp. With a sigh, Agatha steps up to home base beside Herb and the other coach, Bridget Bishop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She charged her! She needs to be disqualified.” Coach Bishop yells, furiously pointing towards the Westview dugout.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your catcher pushed her - twice! - and she punched her. How in God’s name is that my runner’s fault?” Herb questions back, not thinking twice about standing beside his player. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your runner likes to run her mouth. I’m not surprised she said something that got her in trouble.” The Coach hisses back a little softer now. Agatha, privy to Jen’s wide knowledge of gossip, knows exactly what Rio must’ve been taunting the catcher with. While she doesn’t condone winding up the other players, it happens regardless and every team has a mouthy player. Rio just happens to be theirs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everyone runs their mouths. That’s nothing to be disqualified for - nothing like, say, I don’t know - </span><em><span>punching another player</span></em><span>.” Agatha retorts quickly, crossing her arms and waiting expectantly, feeling the satisfaction filling her chest when the grown woman’s face begins turning red. She certainly sees the appeal of getting under an angry woman’s skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s right, the runner has a mouth on her but so does your catcher and she instigated physically.” The umpire points out, fixing the older woman with a stern look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She was spreading rumors-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What about Coach?” Agatha questions, a small smirk sliding over her features when the woman turns red for an entirely different reason. Fiery blue eyes stay locked on the woman, knowing full and well how true those rumors must be if the panic in the coach’s face is anything to go by. The umpire waits patiently but only a few seconds pass before the other Coach gives up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine, she’s benched for the rest of the game.” Coach Bishop relents, backing away from the three with a cautious glance towards Agatha. She sends her a sly wink, ratcheting her anger higher. Agatha and Herb return to the dug out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do I want to know about this rumor?” Herb questions softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s just say Coach Bishop likes one-on-one practice-” Agatha begins slowly but Herb swiftly holds up his hand to stop her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, alright,” Herb sighs and shakes his head, urging Lilia forward to send her out to bat once the opposing team has their new catcher in place, “Check on Vidal. I don’t have the patience to discipline her today - not after that play.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sighs, “And I do?” Herb offers her nothing but a stern glance before focusing back on the game. She spins on her heel to look for the raven haired woman, spotting her on the bench with a bag of ice pressed to her cheek and Dottie hovering over her in concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give us a minute Dottie,” Agatha requested swiftly, taking a seat beside Rio and facing her on the bench. The outfielder steps away with an offer of help if Rio needs anything. “Let me see.” She says softly, reaching up to bring Rio’s hand away from her cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine.” Rio insists, refusing to meet her eyes, but allows Agatha to pull her hand away and look at the darkening bruise anyway. Agatha gently grips her chin and forces the pitcher to turn her head towards her, studying the slightly swollen and red skin. Her other fingers press gently around her cheek bone, fingers holding her firmly when Rio tries to jerk away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Relax, I’m checking to make sure you don’t have any fractures.” Rio scoffs but stays still besides wincing at the tender touches. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She can’t throw that good of a punch.” Rio grumbles, earning a sigh from Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You shouldn’t be getting punched. You have a smart mouth Rio but you need to know when to close it.” Agatha retorts. Rio rolls her eyes and clenches her jaw, Agatha feels the flexing muscles under her finger tips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true,” Rio points out swiftly, “Besides, I can keep myself from throwing a punch - so should she.” She breathes deeply, groaning softly when Agatha presses harder into her cheek. Pain radiates from her cheek all the way through her head, a migraine brewing from the hit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can’t blame her. You have a very punchable face when you’re being an asshole.” Agatha mutters, meaning the words to sound teasing as she helplessly falls back into the comfortability of their normal rapport, but regretting the words as soon as Rio finally looks at her - hurt flashing in cold brown eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It must suck to see someone else do what you want.” Rio whispers, trying very hard to keep the pain from her voice. Agatha’s eyes soften, her chest tightening with words she wishes she could say. </span><em><span>I’m sorry</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>I miss you. Forgive me.</span></em><span> Rio gently but firmly grabs her wrist and pulls her hands away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t mean-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t care,” Rio pushes the words past her lips, setting her eyes forward once more and returning the bag of ice to her cheek. Agatha wants to drag her away and explain everything, convince Rio that this is the best for both of them. She might have to convince herself first. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Take it easy and keep ice on it.” Agatha instructs, pushing up from the bench and putting distance between her and Rio. She comes to the fence lining the dugout, fingers wrapping around chain linked metal and taking a breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Trouble in paradise?” Wanda whispers from beside her. Agatha doesn’t bother responding, ignoring the redhead and moving to the far end of the bench to begin packing up her gear. They win but somehow it doesn’t feel like it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>In a few hours they have their bags packed and are filing back onto the bus for the long ride home. Agatha hesitates once she steps onto the bus, not only avoiding Rio but also navigating a fight with Wanda. She finds a seat between the two women, across from Dottie. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The exhaustion from the day and the rock of the bus as they begin the journey back to Westview threatens to lull her to sleep. She pulls out her textbook and attempts to study, immersing herself in what she can read instead of either woman on the bus. It doesn’t last long. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha,” She raises her head at the hand nudging her foot to see Darcy trying to get her attention, she pulls the headphones from her ears in concern, “Sorry, I just - I think you should check on Rio.” Darcy says softly, her eyes flickering towards the back of the bus. Agatha feels her chest flare with panic as her eyes jump towards the pitcher. Rio is trying to sleep but clearly squirming in pain if the scrunched cringe on her face is any indication. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um,” Agatha glances towards the front of the bus, Herb snoring loudly and Sharon knocked out from her valium, there goes her plan to pass the buck, “Yeah, I’ll check on her.” Darcy returns to her seat, a curious small smile on her lips to see how this plays out. As Agatha pushes from her own, passing the other sleeping women as she makes her way to the back of the bus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio must hear her coming, her eyes opening and zeroing in on her. A ball of nerves settles in Agatha’s stomach, her brain picking the perfect time to remember what Rio told her she would’ve liked to do to her at the back of the bus. Fighting the blush from her cheeks, Agatha slides into the seat beside the raven haired woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Captain, how can I help you?” Rio grumbles, crossing her arms over her chest and trying to get comfortable leaning against the window. All business. She closes her eyes and keeps her mind out of the gutter, some sort of taunt or tease begging to leave her lips. She hates this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How are you feeling?” Agatha asks quietly, her eyes scanning over the pitcher. Rio’s brow furrows and she peeks her eyes open to see Agatha looking her over. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine,” Rio answers instinctively, earning a disbelieving glare. So her cheek is bruised, she has a headache from hell and her thigh is throbbing from the slide to home base. Frankly, she doesn’t feel like sharing that information with Agatha. She doesn’t feel like talking to her at all. The sting of ending things between them still burns and everytime she talks with Agatha it feels like she’s pouring salt in the wound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Be honest,” Agatha prodded, fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and examine the bruise on her cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sighs, “I have a headache.” She relents, slightly, because it makes her kind of sad to see Agatha frown with her brow furrowed in concern like that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Have you taken anything for it?” Agatha questions softer now, already knowing the answer. Rio doesn't respond, confirming the answer Agatha already knew. Suddenly the brunette is sliding out of the seat, surprising Rio because she thought she'd be in for a stern talking at least. Fine by her. Rio settles back against the seat and closes her eyes trying to ignore the pain. The shuffle of feet and drop in the seat beside her makes her eyes open again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Take this,” Agatha demands, holding out her closed fist with pain medication and a water bottle in her other hand. Rio sends her a curious look but obeys, sticking her hand out palm up then rolling her eyes when pills drop into her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you-” Rio begins but Agatha doesn't want to hear it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't care.” Agatha says sternly, remembering the sting of Rio’s words earlier but shaking it off as soon as the woman raises her eyebrows in disbelief. No matter how hard she tries, she cares - too much. Rio must know that. Agatha hopes she does. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Take the medicine, drink the water. I want that gone by the time we reach Westview.” Agatha orders, slipping out of the seat to avoid the feelings brewing in her chest. Rio watches Agatha take a seat before taking the medicine and chugging half of the bottle of water. Even as she tries to sleep all she can think about is Agatha and where they went wrong. </span></p>

<p><span>Herb drops the eighth five gallon bucket of dirty, grimy softballs in front of them. Rio curses under her breath already spotting two more buckets filled with soapy water and toothbrushes. Agatha’s eyebrow jumps to the top of her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve got to be fucking joking,” Agatha whispers, looking over the buckets of balls and the soap filled buckets of water he sets in front of them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I assure you - I am not.” Herb smiles, proud of himself for coming up with such a tedious task for his unruly players. “This is your punishment. I want every ball spotless by the time I return in three hours.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Three hours?” Agatha asks incredulously, her chest already flaring with annoyance and anger to be stuck with Rio for so long. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Great</span></em><span>.” Rio grits out, meeting Agatha’s glare with her own. Herb sighs and places his hands on his hips, looking over his two players very curiously. Despite the big win they had against Salem the two women have refused to speak. Even at practice today, their miscommunication set the whole team off their game. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Listen, you two were electric at the Salem game. We need that again.” Herb explains bluntly, Agatha and Rio glance at one another, “Fix whatever needs fixing because you two are the hammer we will use to crush this season.” Herb gives them pointed looks before leaving them alone in the equipment room. Agatha sighs and grabs one of the toothbrushes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The toothbrushes seem very unnecessary.” She grumbles, pulling an empty bucket free and flipping it upside down to take a seat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You mean you </span><em><span>wouldn't</span></em><span> use a toothbrush to clean a hundred softballs?” Rio responds sarcastically, copying Agatha's move and taking a seat on an upturned bucket. Agatha glares and snags the first ball out of the bucket and gets to work. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t start,” Agatha fixes the raven haired woman with a harsh glare. She has had to endure an entire practice with Rio’s snarky little comments and Wanda’s whiny bitchy voice. She’s sick of it. She wants to go home, specifically to get away from Rio, not spend the next three hours with her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>I</span></em><span> haven’t started anything,” Rio points out, meeting her glare with a smirk. Because if she can’t do what she really wants then she will at least have some fun. Nothing has changed there, she still enjoys getting under Agatha’s skin. It's just a little more targeted now that the bitterness in her voice is due to the other woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How the fuck am I suppossed to get through three hours of your smart mouth talking-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have some ideas for my mouth but I don't think you'll like them,” Rio interjects swiftly, smirk deepening when Agatha groans in frustration. She sees her cheeks flush red and feels a burst of satisfaction and heat in her chest. Unfortunately, Agatha keeps her mouth shut and does her best to avoid thinking about Rio’s mouth and the many ways she can use it. It doesn't work. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It's been a week since she’s had an orgasm. She desperately wanted to get herself over the edge but using her own hand wasn't the same and she didn't want to imagine Rio when she was doing it. That would have sent her down a black hole. She thought about texting Ralph, god knows he would come running, but that has to be a worse idea than fucking herself to the idea of Rio. She manages to get through an hour of silence, scrubbing and soft curses before Rio pushes her over the edge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you think we can dunk the rest of these in water and leave?” Rio questions aloud, anxiety and bitterness forcing her to fill the silence and keep Agatha on her toes. Not to mention, they're only half way through eight buckets and her hands are sore. As soon as she speaks the brunette is glaring at her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you think I should leave you to do the rest?” Agatha retorts quickly. Rio chuckles and grabs for another softball. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You would miss me too much,” Rio teases. Agatha scoffs and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I really wouldn't.” Agatha bites back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that why you're squirming so much?” Rio points out with a smirk, eyes darkening as she looks over the catcher just in time to see her shifting once more. Rio knows those moves very well. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because you </span><em><span>don't </span></em><span>miss me?” Agatha's eyes flash up to Rio's, burning with heat and anger. A little bit of panic flaring in her chest because of course Rio is right. Just being in close proximity to the brunette is making her </span><em><span>want</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We're not talking about that-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There's nothing to talk about,” Rio points out, earning a suspicious look from Agatha, “You got scared.” The brunette's anger grows. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn't- we could've have been-” Agatha can't find her words, her hand is gripping the softball so hard her knuckles are turning white. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got scared, Agatha. Own it.” Rio says sternly. Agatha’s jaw clenches and she stands, putting her finished bucket off to the side and grabbing another. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck you, Rio. You don't understand.” Agatha mumbles, dragging a bucket over to her spot. Agatha could lose so much if she was caught with Rio. Wanda would've lost her mind, her mother surely would've found out and god knows the team would give her hell. Rio lets out a sarcastic laugh, standing to grab her own bucket. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That's where you're wrong. I understand just fine.” Rio retorts, the move bringing them face to face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really? And what do you </span><em><span>supposedly</span></em><span> understand?” Agatha hisses, letting the ball in her hand splash into the water as she steps closer. No matter how much she hates it, Rio is always taller than her, looking down at her with desire hooded eyes. It sends a fresh wave of heat through her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I understand that you have appearances to uphold. No one can tarnish your mean girl, badass softball captain, straight A student, mommy's girl appearance, right?” Rio questions knowingly. Agatha seethe with rage and anxiety. How can Rio be so blind and see through her all at the same time? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You think I want this?” Agatha hisses, her hands balling into fists at her sides, “The unattainable standards my mother has held me to my entire life - the sacrifices and risks I have made just to be on this team - to enjoy a sliver of my life before this fantasy ends.” Rio's brow furrows, confusion streaking across her face. Agatha huffs, emotions climbing up her throat and the sting of tears in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is how the rest of my life plays out; I graduate Westview with the highest honors at the top of my class. I take over Harkness Energy from my Mother who will undoubtedly hover over my shoulder every second. I marry the man of my mother's choosing. I pop out a few heirs and I die as the cold hearted wicked witch of Harkness Energy just like my mother.” Agatha pants softly for breath, swallowing the pain in her voice when Rio's eyes softened. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This softball league becomes nothing but a blissful memory - </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> become nothing but a blissful memory.” Agatha whispers harshly, forcing herself to reign it in, turn her emotions off and become the Wicked Witch of Westview. Rio doesn't buy it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then I want you to remember me,” She pushes forward, grabbing Agatha by her hips and pulling them flush, “If that's what you think your life will be then don't you want something to look back on?” Agatha is finding it very difficult to pull away even though she knows that distance is the only way to stay strong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That's not fair to you,” Agatha whispers, bringing her hands up to Rio's arms but not pushing away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you think this isn't what I want,” Rio lets out a small huff, laughing at the thought of not caring about Agatha Harkness. She can't remember the last time her every thought wasn't consumed by the woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You get nothing out of this,” Agatha tries to reason, shaking her head and pushing at the strong arms holding her still, “You could find any woman in the world who would happily give you more than I ever could.” Rio doesn't budge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get you,” Rio answers strongly, instinctively, ignoring the screaming voices in her head to step away and avoid the heartbreak. But somehow getting her heartbroken by Agatha Harkness is better than not having her at all. Those words stun Agatha into silence. Rio doesn't wait for her to find her words, dropping her lips and finding Agatha’s with a softness they've rarely shared. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is frozen for a second, her lips adjusting to the warmth that is Rio, eyes fluttering closed. Part of her wants to remain in control. The other part of her remembers the relief and pleasure Rio gave her when she finally let go. She craves that now. She feels the heat between them easily melting her resolve, her hands sliding up Rio's toned arms to cup her face. She melts, her lips becoming pliable under the pitcher's mouth. Strong arms wrap around her waist, pulling her closer and a moan from her throat. She has missed this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grunts softly, wishing their clothes would disappear into thin air because this isn't close enough for her. Unfortunately, they are still in the equipment room and getting naked isn't a smart move on any level. Even if the door could lock. She moves them backwards, towards a part of the room partially blocked by basketballs and batting practice nets. Agatha has her tongue teasing into Rio's mouth when her back hits shelving. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha groans, something digging into her back and using one hand to push it away, something clattering to the ground. It's too loud for where they are. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is a really bad idea,” She whispers, although her hands are scrambling to reach her pants. Rio chuckles against her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It is,” Rio agrees, one hand pushing Agatha's hands away as her other slips past the tight waistband of her leggings. A searing moan breaks through plump lips and Rio's free hand comes to cover her mouth. She smiles, gliding her fingers through her folds to coat them with the arousal she finds there. Their eyes meet and Agatha feels a shiver roll down her spine. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I've missed you,” Rio husks, sliding two fingers into her soaking wet pussy. Agatha moans loudly into the hand over her mouth and hates the smug smirk she gets in return. She pulls the hand from her mouth and pulls her forward to crush their lips together. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I hate you,” Agatha whispers with a telling smile, filled with adoration and desire. Rio chuckles darkly and easily begins a rhythm that leaves the other woman breathless. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You've gotta be quick for me.” Rio says sternly, her fingers pumping harder and angling her palm to grind her hand into her throbbing clit. Agatha moans, nodding in agreement as she squeezes the fingers inside of her, not capable of lasting long at all after this last week. A hand comes back to cover her mouth, a mischievous glint reflecting in brown eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And quiet,” Rio teases, smirking when Agatha's muffled moan vibrates her hand. She plays the woman like a fiddle, working her up so easily she can't wait to do it again. In fact, Rio moves in closer to bring her mouth level with her ear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can't wait to have you alone again,” Rio husks, placing a kiss against her neck and shoulder, “Writhing under me - loud and needy, just how I like you.” Rio groans with the thought, the dirty images invading her mind. Agatha whimpers, nails digging into the back of Rio’s neck and grinding forward to meet her thrusts. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You feel so fucking good.” Rio mutters, crooking her fingers to pull a filthy moan from deep within the brunette's chest. Agatha won't last long. She hikes her leg up around Rio's hip and tugs her forward, pushing the fingers inside of her deeper. A curse gets muffled against the hand on her mouth, a sly smirk pressing into her neck with another kiss.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck my fingers, baby - just like that, you're doing so </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>.” Rio latches her lips onto supple skin and sucks, leaving a mark. Agatha whines, the crest of her orgasm coming fast. Her fingers dig in deeper and her hips move faster. She wants to speak, try to get Rio to drive her into the fucking wall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you gonna come for me?” Rio whispers, raising her head to watch the show, Agatha moans and nods her head, “Open those pretty eyes. I want to see you come - I want you falling apart on my fucking fingers.” Rio demands, smiling when blue eyes flutter open, pupils blown wide and hazy with lust. It doesn't last long, Agatha’s climax crashes down on her like a fucking earthquake. Her eyes slam shut and she holds on for dear life while Rio fucks her. Every moan, gasp and curse that leaves her mouth is muffled by Rio's hand and lost in her mind while the other woman talks her through it. Dirty, nasty words whispered into her ear and slid down her spine like honey. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha still hasn't caught her breath by the time Rio pulls her fingers out. Her eyes flutter open at the soft sounds of sucking, moaning softly at the image of Rio sucking on her fingers. The fingers that were just inside of Agatha. A wicked smirk crosses Rio's lips as she pulls her fingers from her lips with a pop and shifts her hand to grip Agatha's jaw instead. She leans in, kissing her deep and long so the brunette can taste herself, moaning into the kiss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think we fixed what needed fixing,” Rio muses softly once they part. Agatha smiles and rolls her eyes, affectionately annoyed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think we need to finish these softballs so I can repay the favor.” Agatha tugs her closer to kiss again. Rio smiles into the kiss but reluctantly breaks it, leading Agatha from their hiding spot to return to their punishment. Teasing winks and sly smiles pass between them until they've finally finished cleaning all of the softballs. Herb returns and is relieved to see the two women sharing a smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well done ladies.” Herb says happily, breaking the two women from their spell as the head coach looks over the many buckets filled with clean balls. Rio tosses the last ball into the nearest bucket and the damn toothbrush onto the ground. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Have you learned your lesson?” He fixes them both with a stern glare. Agatha rolls her eyes, stretching the muscles in her arms and rolling out her neck. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Use soapy water to wash softballs?” Rio retorts quickly, it makes Agatha smile so wide Herb has a hard time keeping up his glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Vidal,” he warns swiftly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No more sneaking out of hotel rooms to…have some fun,” Rio responds with a pointed glance at her captain. Agatha pins her with a glare. Rio smirks but Herb is satisfied with her answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get out of here. Eat, sleep and be ready for the game tomorrow.” Herb insists, nodding his head towards the door. Agatha and Rio don't hesitate to leave, grabbing their bags and heading for the exit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'll meet you in an hour-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, you won't. Get in,” Agatha says strongly, opening the trunk of her Bronco and tossing her bag inside. She isn't going to wait to have Rio all to herself again. Rio hesitates for all of a second before following suit. The drive to Agatha's apartment is quick. The amount of time it takes for Agatha to press Rio against her kitchen counter is even quicker. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, Agatha.” Rio tries to catch her breath after that kiss, Agatha's lips skating down her neck as her hands push and pull at her pants. Rio is more than eager to help get rid of her clothes. As soon she is naked she tries to lead them back toward the bed but Agatha isn't having it. Her hands push Rio back by her hips until she is pressed against the counter, lips dropping to her chest and reveling in the moan that sounds above her. She does not want to wait the five seconds it takes to lead them to her bed. Instead, Agatha shifts her hands low enough to lift. Rio grips the counter and places herself onto it with a smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eager?” Rio teases, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shoulders to pull her between her legs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hungry</span></em><span>,” Agatha husks, her voice thick with lust, wasting no time in sliding her hands under muscular thighs to get them on her shoulder. Rio just barely catches herself from falling backwards on the counter behind her, knocking something onto the ground, and gasping softly at the hot kisses descending down her stomach to reach the apex of her legs.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There are beds for this,” Rio jests lightly but she is already making herself comfortable on top of the counter, leaning back on her palms and watching the brunette between her thighs. Agatha smiles, getting on her knees and dropping a kiss to her thigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach said eat,” Agatha husks with a smirk, enjoying the genuine laugh it pulls from the raven haired woman, “I'm eating.” She moves forward, taking Rio into her mouth and moaning into her. Rio groans softly, using one hand to thread her fingers through the brunette's hair and grinding her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't think he had this in mind.” Rio mutters smugly, biting her lip as she watches Agatha's eyes flicker with amusement. Agatha, learned how to eat pussy in a crash course with Rio who had no qualms about telling her exactly what to do. She learned quickly and she was </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>. So good Rio actually felt her legs shake after her orgasm. Needless to say, Agatha loved making her come and eating her out was another enjoyable way to make that happen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio's orgasm comes on fast and strong, leaving her breathing labored and her arms struggling to hold herself up. She has to pull Agatha away just to catch her breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus fucking christ,” Rio moans, hips twitching, yanking Agatha up to meet her lips regardless of the mess on her mouth. They moan into the kiss, tongues fighting for dominance. Rio wins, slipping from the counter and finally leading them towards the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“On the bed,” Rio husks, nudging the catcher to lay back and straddling her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come here,” Agatha requests softly, pulling the pitcher down to meet her lips. This kiss is slower this time around, they melt into each other with moans and gasps. Little smiles peeking through their lips and hands wandering each other's bodies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio shifts to slot their thighs together, grinding down as Agatha grinds up. Wetness streaks each of their thighs, evidence of their arousal pushing them faster. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I - </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> - I think I can come from this,” Agatha whispers in shock against her lips, one hand dropping down to Rio's tight ass and squeezing to pull her closer. The pitcher groans, dropping her hips harder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Me too. Lift your leg - </span><em><span>yes</span></em><span>, oh my God.” Rio releases a loud moan and crushes their lips together in a bruising kiss. Her hand grabs the brunette's outer thigh and hikes it around her waist, smiling when she hears a curse against her lips. The new angle works better for both of them, hips bucking and grinding. Hands gripping and nails raking across soft skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep going, keep going - </span><em><span>fuck!</span></em><span>” Agatha gasps in pleasure, curling in on the other woman as her hips chase her release. Rio follows close behind her, burying her head in the woman's shoulder with a groan, and shaking limbs. They are both covered in sweat, shaking through their release and panting for breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy shit,” Rio mutters into slick skin, placing a soft kiss after her words, delighted to see goosebumps rising in its wake. She has never had an orgasm so intense and intimate. Agatha chuckles lightly, licking her lips and dropping her head back against the mattress. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy shit,” Agatha echoes in agreement, keeping her leg loosely around her hips and bringing a hand to run her fingers through her hair. Rio groans softly, peppering more kisses over her skin until she reaches her neck. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep doing that and I'll fall asleep,” Rio teases, smiling as a chuckle vibrates against her wandering lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep doing </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> and I'll keep you awake.” Agatha scratches her nails across the back of her neck and giggles at the full body shiver that runs down Rio’s spine. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans, leaning up to reunite their lips in a soft kiss. Just as she pulls away, her stomach growls in protest at the lack of food. Agatha laughs when Rio actually looks shy. The raven-haired woman pushes herself up.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe we should eat…” Rio mutters with red cheeks. Agatha smiles and nods her head, running her hands down her sides with a sigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We can do that.” Agatha agrees, feeling her own stomach twist with hunger. Rio climbs from the bed, arousal still coating her leg and inner thighs, looking as comfortable in Agatha's apartment as she would her own. It makes Agatha smile, flipping onto her stomach to watch the pitcher rifle through the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell, Harkness? What do you eat?” Rio asks in confusion when she comes up with nothing but stale potato chips and a bottle of vodka. Agatha blushes and runs a hand through her hair, musing it more than it already is creating a mane of unruly hair to flow over her shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I eat a lot of take out,” She admits shyly and shrugs her shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you still look like that?” Rio asks incredulously, swaying her hips as she walks back towards the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I work hard for this body,” Agatha says proudly. Rio hums softly, her eyes raking over the brunette and thinking of the many ways to defile her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have no food, Agatha,” Rio says in disappointment, cupping the catcher's jaw and running her thumb over her skin, “How am I supposed to impress you with my cooking skills if you have no food?” She asks sweetly, her thumb coming to graze her bottom lip. The subtly lewd act sends heat racing down Agatha's spine to pool between her thighs. She pushes up onto her knees, stopping at the edge of the bed where Rio is watching her with considerably darker eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'll order pizza and make it up to you until it gets here.” Agatha husks, her fingers trailing down and down and down until reaching Rio's slick heat. The pitcher moans softly, biting her lip and brushing the wild hair back Agatha’s face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're gonna need your hands,” Rio smirks, leaning in for a soft kiss. Agatha groans softly, reluctantly pulling her hands away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just lay down and let me worry about the rest.” Agatha steps off of the bed, searching for her phone and swiftly finding the number for Angelico's Pizzeria saved in her contacts. The line connects just as she turns around to find Rio laying on the bed, a hand between her bent legs and a moan leaking from her lips. Agatha can hear the man on the other end of the phone but her brain doesn't process it right away. Rio smirks that smug fucking smirk and decides now is the time to put on a show. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha mutters, eyes jumping between Rio's face and the hand working slow circles around her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Miss Harkness, that you?” The man, Angelo, knows her well. She might be a regular.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, yeah, Angelo - I need my regular order.” Agatha mutters on autopilot, leaning against the back of the couch, settling into a front row view of the other woman. Rio moans, not bothering to restrict her noise, and dropping a finger down between her lips in search of her entrance. Agatha bites her lip to stay quiet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One large pepperoni with the garlic crust. Same address? Paying Cash?” Angelo questions. Agatha makes a noise of confirmation at the back of her throat. She is pushing off of the couch and moving closer to the other woman as the conversation nears its end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks Angelo,” Agatha mutters, ending the call and tossing her phone somewhere on the mess of comforter and sheets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are </span><em><span>evil</span></em><span>,” Agatha breathes out, climbing onto the bed just in time to see the pitcher fit two fingers into her cunt with a guttural moan. She crumbles, pouring into the space between strong thighs and kissing the evidence of her arousal from the sweet, salty skin of her inner thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You love it.” Rio smiles deviously, parting her legs wider and moaning as she pumps into herself a few more times. Slowly retracting her fingers, she offers them to the brunette, thrilled to see blue eyes locked in on every move of her hand. Rio moans as soon as soft lips and a hot mouth with a talented tongue wraps around the digits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha grunts a soft noise of appreciation, sucking her fingers, running her tongue up to split them apart and gather every inch of arousal coating them. She brings her own hand to Rio’s pussy, gliding through her wetness before filling her once more. Rios groans, wanting to lose herself in the pleasure of the brunette's touch but enjoying the way she sucks her fingers so expertly. Agatha slowly pulls her mouth from her wet fingers, a gentle kiss to her knuckles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Touch yourself,” Agatha instructs, leading Rio's hand back towards her clit. Rio doesn't have to be told twice, returning her fingers to the pace they kept up before with a moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We have ten minutes before the pizza gets here,” Agatha whispers, her mouth licking and kissing, sucking marks into soft skin. Rio bucks into her own hand and grinds down onto Agatha’s fingers. The way her walls squeeze so deliciously around Agatha’s fingers she doesn't think she will last very long. That won't do. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio arches into her touch, labored breaths and moans of pleasure filling the apartment. It didn't take very long for her to reach the edge. Just as her spine arches and her hips grind down onto thrusting fingers, those fingers pull away. A frustrated twisted groan and moan falls from her lips as she looks between her legs. Agatha forcefully removes her hand from her clit and replaces it with her mouth.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>,” Rio breathes out, using her hand to keep Agatha’s mouth on her cunt. Agatha hums happily, bringing her fingers back to tease her entrance. She glances at the alarm clock at her bedside to see that they still have around four minutes before the pizza arrives and plans to keep Rio teetering on the edge until then. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck me with your fingers,” Rio requests quickly, pushing up onto one elbow with her other hand still tangled in Agatha's mess of hair to watch. Her hips grind up, the tongue on her clit dragging across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha takes the directive but only slides one finger into the other woman. While teasing, she is still making a good effort, curling her finger and hitting that sweet spot inside of the pitcher. But, it brings Rio too close to the edge so she takes her mouth away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha.” Rios hand fists in her hair, squeezing around her finger desperate for more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha answers dryly, pumping her finger slowly. The hand in her hair turns rough, yanking her closer and pulling a moan from her throat with the pain. Their eyes meet again, Agatha's soft breath washing over Rio's throbbing clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you,” Agatha breathes out, voice straining because she wants to give in but she holds steady, “We have ten minutes until the pizza gets here.” Rio bites back a groan, hips begging to burst forward and make Agatha put her mouth on her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You want to make me wait?” Rio whispers, accepting the challenge and removing her hand from Agatha’s hair, with a lot of difficulty, to continue propping herself up. She spreads her legs wider and looks pointedly towards the apex of her thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go ahead, baby. Show me how hungry you are,” Rio husks, relinquishing control, feeling her clit twitch with the darkness setting in blue eyes. Agatha doesn't know what to say - doesn't know what to do because she quickly regrets her decision. If she had known it would bring them here, she would've saved this tactic for when she didn't have a time limit. Just so she could spend hours between Rio's thighs, teasing her until she couldn't take another second of it. She continues to thrust her finger, adding a second as she shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Another time I am going to take you up on that,” Agatha whispers, lapping slowly at her clit, “but right now I want to hear you screaming for me.” Rio moans deeply as the brunette renews her efforts, giving her more and more until she is back on the edge. She keeps her hands to herself, gripping the sheets and struggling to keep her head raised and eyes open to watch. Rio loves to see Agatha work, whether it be between her thighs, behind home plate or stepping up to base. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm almost there. Don't stop,” Rio breathes out. Agatha moans against her, sliding a third finger into her wet heat and sucking her clit a little harder. Rio moans louder, her fingers itching to reach down and slide her fingers into thick strands of unruly hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A loud knock cuts through the apartment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck.” Agatha hisses as she raises her head, drawing a frustrated groan from the woman in front of her. Rio doesn't hesitate to reach down and fist her hand in Agatha's hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't you fucking dare.” Rio glares but it looks more pleading than anything when she takes labored breaths, cheeks that glow red and wild eyes. The sight of Rio so beautifully undone makes Agatha smile. So she found another way to get under the woman's skin. Deny her an orgasm. Agatha withdraws her fingers and backs out of Rio's grasp. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep your hands to yourself.” Agatha demands.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You fucking bitch,” Rio growls. Agatha chuckles while wiping off her hand and snagging her robe from the bathroom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Careful, Rio. You sound </span><em><span>desperate</span></em><span>.” Agatha’s eyes glint mischievously when the raven haired beauty bores holes into her, heat radiating through her. Another knock sounds through the apartment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio huffs and falls back against the bed when Agatha actually leaves her to answer the door. She takes matters into her own hands, rubbing her clit and eagerly filling herself with two fingers. A moan crawls from her throat and she bucks into her hands. Agatha looks over her shoulder with furrowed brows and a soft groan of annoyance. She should've tied her up</span><em><span>- oh</span></em><span>. That is an idea she never thought she would be interested in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha opens the door, shoving a handful of cash into the teenager's hand and telling him to keep the change. His eyes widen when Rio's very loud and unrestrained moans reach his ears. Agatha rolls her eyes and takes the pizza, slamming the door in his face and flicking the lock. She places the pizza onto the counter and looks back at the woman writhing on her bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I said keep your hands to yourself.” Agatha comes back to the bed, watching Rio desperately humping into her own hands, a shit eating grin in her face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am,” Rio says smugly, groaning and feeling her orgasm coiling in her gut. Her legs shake with the effort to stay open, wanting the woman to watch. Agatha climbs onto the bed with an amused smile, unsurprised by the woman's loophole.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you close?” Agatha asks, already knowing the answer when Rio starts nodding her head, back arching clear off the mattress. Agatha rips her away, replacing Rio's two fingers with three of her own. A gasp quickly turns into a guttural moan.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, Agatha - </span><em><span>fuck!</span></em><span>” Rio comes undone, arching her back and rubbing her clit through the waves. Agatha doesn't let up, using her other hand to grip the pitcher's hip and holds on tight as her fingers work. Agatha drinks up the sights of Rio struggling to catch her breath and squirming under her touch. Rio relents the friction on her clit, swiftly grabbing the brunette's wrist to stop her thrusts. Agatha obliges, stays three fingers deep inside of the other woman and leans forward to kiss her sweat slicked skin. Her kisses make the muscles under her lips twitch with attention, a smile cracking through her desire. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love seeing you get so worked up for me, sweetheart,” Agatha whispers smugly, genuinely, enveloping the pitcher's taut nipple between her lips to suck, the pet name falling from her lips so naturally she doesn't even realize she said it. Rio groans, thankful for the lips on her chest as a reason to clench around the fingers buried inside of her and </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> because of the warmth that fills her chest from the ‘</span><em><span>sweetheart’</span></em><span> Agatha whispers into her skin. She slides her hand into wild hair and tugs softly to bring Agatha’s lips further north.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Sweetheart</span></em><span>?” Rio teases, enjoying the blush that crosses pale cheeks. Their lips connect in a soft kiss and another. Agatha feels the anxiety crawling up her spine, unsure how to take the other woman's response. Did Rio dislike the pet name - hate it? She didn't seem like the pet name type. Are they at a point where they call each other </span><em><span>babe</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>sweetheart</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>honey</span></em><span>? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up.” Agatha pulls away with flaming cheeks and vulnerability brewing in her gut. Rio doesn't let her get far, having become an expert in all things </span><em><span>Agatha Harkness</span></em><span> and spotting the glint of anxiety through her embarrassment with ease. She acts before Agatha can spiral, tugging their lips together once more.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio bares herself as much as Agatha, “I like it,” She husks, tucking unruly strands of hair behind Agatha's ears and places another kiss to her lips that slowly smile in response, “</span><em><span>Honey</span></em><span>.” She has to get one little jab in. She wouldn't be herself if she wasn't taunting or teasing the brunette. Agatha grunts softly and rolls her eyes, dragging her lips away from the playful woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're insufferable.” Agatha looks between them as she slowly withdrawals her fingers, running a soothing hand over Rio's thigh as she does. Rio moans softly and stretches slightly before slipping from the bed, her limbs coming back to life as if she didn't just have a toe curling orgasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>I'm</span></em><span> hungry,” Rio retorts, smiling over her shoulder as she slips into the bathroom. Agatha can't believe the stamina and rebound on this woman. With a huff of disbelief and awe, she slips from the bed as well, on the hunt for plates and napkins in her minimal kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just as she sets the heavenly smelling pizza onto the coffee table alongside two bottles of beer Rio emerges from the bathroom, looking thoroughly fucked and sporting Agatha's Westview University Softball t-shirt from her freshman year. It looks fucking amazing on her. Agatha actually does a double take before fully appreciating the view. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>To see Rio Vidal like </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> - vulnerable, soft and warm - feels like a privilege she will never take for granted.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You kind of ruined my underwear earlier…” Rio begins pointedly, a smile on her lips from the way Agatha seems so star struck. It takes a few seconds for the words to sink in but when they do, the brunette swiftly walks to her dresser and snags her sluttiest pair of green lace panties from her drawer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Will these work?” Agatha questions, holding up the panties with her finger tip and tilting her head in question. Rio comes to meet her, taking the panties without hesitation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Green, my favorite,” Rio hums happily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I had a feeling.” Agatha is quickly drawn into the raven-haired woman, reaching out to grip the hem of her T-shirt between two fingers and tugging her closer. Rio loves the insatiable side of Agatha and wants nothing more than to indulge her but just as their lips are about to connect, her stomach rumbles hungrily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha chuckles softly, exercising great restraint as she settles for one kiss, “Maybe I should let you eat.” She teases, walking back towards the couch. Rio follows seconds after sliding the green panties up her legs. Agatha takes a seat on the couch and watches the entrancing woman sway her hips as she walks, clearly putting on a performance for her captain. Just a peek of green lace appears every other step. It makes Agatha hungry for something other than pizza. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't worry. I'm not done with you yet, Captain.” Rio sends the brunette a wink and takes her seat, eagerly grabbing her plate. Agatha feels a ball of nerves swirl inside her chest at the reminder of her status. Softball Captain - Rio's Captain. Agatha takes a bite of her own pizza, keeping her mouth full while thinking of a plan to bring up the topic, only slightly distracted at the way Rio moans with her first bite.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is fucking amazing,” Rio mutters in awe, going in for another bite. It makes Agatha smile to see her so easily impressed. Not that she shouldn't be, Angelo's is Westview’s best slice of pizza.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I ordered this pizza almost every night of my freshman year,” Agatha muses thoughtfully, “My Mother never let me eat  any type of junk food. I went a little crazy when I first came to Westview - gained ten pounds on Angelo's alone.” Rio smiles wide and toothy, her eyes sparkling with interest as Agatha speaks.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I find that hard to believe,” Rio draws suspiciously, she has a feeling Agatha indulges in guilty pleasures quite often but discipline and hard work keep her slim. Agatha looks a little embarrassed then.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It's the truth.” Agatha insists. Rio hums softly, unconvinced, taking another bite of her pizza instead. Agatha clears her throat and pushes the strands of loose hair away from her face, behind her ears. The nerves are getting the better of her. She is down two slices of pizza when she finally finds some courage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> is an </span><em><span>us</span></em><span> thing. Right?” Yikes. </span><em><span>Well done, Agatha</span></em><span>. Rio was in the middle of sipping her beer during the question, simply raising her eyebrows in surprise. She swallows carefully and tilts her head slightly in curiosity, amusement glinting in her eyes and a small smirk gracing her lips. Agatha feels heat throb through her body both from lust and embarrassment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“An </span><em><span>us</span></em> <em><span>thing</span></em><span>?” Rio questions curiously, amused. Agatha feels heat settle on her cheeks. She takes another sip from her beer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We're…</span><em><span>exclusive</span></em><span>?” Agatha clarifies hesitantly, waving her hand dismissively and sneaking glances at the woman while picking at the label of her beer bottle. Rio smiles wider, revealing a beautiful toothy grin as a small chuckle leaves her chest.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio says slowly, fixing the other woman with an intense and knowing look, “Are you asking if we're </span><em><span>girlfriends</span></em><span>?” She says the word tauntingly, almost in a whisper as if the question is shocking. Agatha catches on to her games, narrowing her eyes and setting her beer down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck you, Rio.” Agatha huffs in frustration, running her hand through her hair and looking anywhere but at the infuriating woman across from her. She only caves when Rio moves closer after placing her own bottle down. The raven haired woman is on top of her now, keeping their eyes locked as she climbs into her lap, Agatha instinctively drops her hands to the soft skin of toned thighs and helplessly runs her fingers across the flexing muscles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pushes wild curls away from the brunette's face and cups her cheeks, tilting her head up to keep their eyes locked together. She sees the vulnerability and worry in those blue eyes and feels her chest tighten. She'll make it right. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio whispers, rubbing her thumbs across her cheeks and taking a breath, thankful she has some liquid courage in her system, “I'm not going anywhere. I'm not sharing you. You're stuck with me. So, yes, I am your girlfriend.” Agatha feels her cheeks press up against Rio's warm hands when she smiles. They kiss, both of them leaning in to reach the other. The kiss easily turns into something heated but Agatha has more anxiety inducing concerns popping into her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wait, uh, rules,” Agatha whispers as their lips break, Rio not necessarily respecting the space she is requesting by moving her lips south, “We need rules we will actually stick to.” Agatha points out, eyes closing and head falling back to give Rio more room. A soft hum vibrates against her throat and sends heat between her legs once again. Being completely naked under the thin silk robe isn't helping, especially when hands begin to wander and her stiff nipples poke into the silky smooth material.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I remember them. Do you want more?” Rio asks curiously, taking her time to untie the sash around the brunette's waist. Agatha swallows roughly, trying to think through the fog that Rio fills her head with. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We just need to be careful. Wanda caught me wearing your Eastview shirt,” Agatha feels a moan building in her chest just as Rio pulls back, relieved and frustrated at the sudden lack of soft lips exploring her neck. She opens her eyes and lifts her head to look at the other woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit,” Rio mutters, worrying her lip between her teeth. Realizing that they - </span><em><span>she </span></em><span>can't be so careless this time around. Before she forced herself to be indifferent about their situation, using Agatha for pleasure as much as she was using Rio regardless of the repercussions the catcher would face, but things are different now. They are together - </span><em><span>girlfriends</span></em><span> - she cares more than ever. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah.” Agatha breathes out. Rio leans back, resting herself on Agatha’s thighs and placing her hand on her own thighs to keep them to herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, we have to be more careful - actually follow our rules,” Rio says slowly, watching Agatha nod along in agreement, before deciding on something very strongly. She places a palm on Agatha’s chest, pressing her back into the couch as her other hand parts her silk robe. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha takes a deep breath, feeling the weight of Rio’s hot hand on her sternum and melting underneath her. Rio’s gaze turns dark, exposing the brunette’s chest and taking her fill of her perky breasts and taut nipples. She wets her lips, wanting them in her mouth as soon as possible but resisting the urge - she has other urges to fulfill.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I want to amend a rule,” Rio husks, bringing her hands to Agatha’s sides and leaning down to place a kiss against her chest, right above her heart. Hands slide into her hair, keeping her mouth on heated skin, her lips curling in smug amusement when goosebumps erupt across her skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Which one?” Agatha breathes out, scratching her nails over the back of the pitcher’s neck. Rio flicks her tongue against soft skin as she moves lower, set on a path toward her begging nipple. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The hickies.” Rio sucks the nipple into her mouth, teeth grazing her skin just to hear Agatha’s breath catch in her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What about them?” The breathless quality in her voice makes Agatha sound pathetic. Teeth nip at the skin between her breasts on the way toward her other nipple. Her fingers twitch in anticipation, tangling in dark hair as she just barely stops her spine from arching impatiently. Rio sucks a little harder and relishes the soft mewling sound Agatha releases as her back arches for more contact. She moves upward instead of indulging. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All hickies - can and will be…” Rio trails off, finding the supple skin at the base of Agatha’s throat to latch on, biting and sucking as her tongue swirls across the darkening flesh. The brunette moans softly, arching her neck back into the couch and gripping the back of Rio’s neck harder, catching onto her plan and loving it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio hums softly as she pulls back to admire the red mark on pale skin, set to be a dark bruise in no time, “</span><em><span>Visible</span></em><span>.” She smiles and glances up into Agatha’s darkening blue eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes.” Agatha agrees readily, tugging the pitcher forward and arching her neck as an invitation. Rio chuckles softly but keeps her distance, moving Agatha’s hands to her hips instead. The brunette frowns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The other rules stay the same - no one finds out and we don't </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> anywhere we could get caught.” Rio lets her smile slip into a smirk when she says ‘fuck’ because she fondly remembers the way Agatha squirmed under her attention the last time they created the rules. Agatha smiles and nods her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you think you can stick to the third rule this time?” Rio teases, leaning forward again to brush her lips along a strong jaw. The brunette lets her head fall back against the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha answers confidently, moving her hands down to the ass on her lap. She squeezes and pulls her forward, pressing them closer and grinding her hips up against the raven-haired woman. Rio hums low in her chest, happily meeting her grind for grind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure?” Rio husks, lips dropping to mark the skin just under the brunette's jaw and smiling in satisfaction when it produces a small mark, “You are so easily…</span><em><span>corrupted</span></em><span>.” Her hands turn a little rough as she once again takes Agatha's breasts into her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans softly and arches into the touch, squeezing her thighs together and bucking up toward the friction Rio is giving her. </span><em><span>Yes, she is easily corrupted by Rio Vidal</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But not this time, right? You're going to be </span><em><span>so </span></em><span>good for me.” Rio muses, enjoying how Agatha's hips jerk up and her grip tightens. She drops her hips a little more, providing more friction and pulling a moan from the woman below her. Agatha only vaguely registers the smug tone in Rio's voice but only after she is eagerly nodding her head in agreement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moves off of her lap, a choked grunt of disappointment slipping past soft lips, but as soon as she positions herself on the carpet bracketed by Agatha’s thighs, she hears no more complaints. Rio leans forward, alternating attention between her breasts and marking flawless skin as she paves a path toward her end goal. Agatha is nearly shaking in anticipation, eyes blown wide and dark as she watches Rio work, just barely biting her tongue to keep the pleas in her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I want to hear you say it,” Rio says, her mouth finally reaching slick thighs and flicking her tongue out for a taste, “You'll be good for me.” Agatha once again nods her head without thought as she digs her fingers into the fabric of the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I-I’ll be good.” The admission leaves her lips with a soft stuttering breath, cheeks heating red with embarrassment. </span><em><span>She did not just say that so easily</span></em><span>. It doesn't matter when she notices how Rio's pupils grow wider and her lips curl into a feral smile that promises Agatha’s unraveling. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio eagerly drops her lips to the wet cunt of her girlfriend.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Good girl</span></em><span>.”</span></p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio has been on fire since the Salem game. Despite Wanda’s strenuous efforts Herb has made it a habit to swap the pitcher's toward the end of the game, the last two innings always securing their win no matter the state of the scoreboard. The Westview Witches are, so far, undefeated. Wanda fights him on it every time but she never wins. Agatha keeps herself distanced from the decision but that doesn't stop the increasingly dark glare she receives everyday from one redhead in particular.</p><p>Even with Wanda glaring glowing red daggers at her head, Agatha is happy. For once, she has what she wants. Her classes are going well, her team is undefeated and her relationship with Rio, while secret, is thriving.</p><p>The team, after the last win, decided to have a movie night at Wanda's very large two bedroom apartment that her parents undoubtedly pay for. The whole team is crowded together either on the couch or the floor with bowls of popcorn, drinks and candy surrounding them.</p><p>“Pass the popcorn, Kale.” Agatha whispers, holding out her hand and curling her fingers in urgency. Jen huffs and rolls her eyes but passes the bowl of heavily buttered popcorn to her captain.</p><p>“Where is your bowl?” Jen hisses back. Agatha jerks her thumb down the couch toward the blonde and dark haired woman who have cozied up together with a bowl of popcorn between them. Rio takes a handful of popcorn from the bowl, leaning in closer to Agatha to do so, which sends the brunette’s heart jumping in her chest before she answers.</p><p>“Darcy and Dottie are hogging-”</p><p>“Shhh.” Wanda glares at them, harsher at Agatha, before focusing on the large flat screen TV. Agatha bites her tongue and shakes her head, taking a handful of popcorn and passing it back to the first baseman.</p><p>Jen sends a cautious look towards the redheaded pitcher and a knowing one towards Agatha but also bites her tongue. Agatha isn't the only person who has been on the receiving end of Wanda’s anger. More than once she has snapped at every single team member over the past few weeks, even Dottie who does nothing but fawn over the redhead has kept her distance.</p><p>Agatha glances at the redhead, taking in her tired and angered form. They have barely spoken to each other in three weeks. Unfortunately, Agatha knows her well enough to know that Wanda is struggling. Bags under her eyes, hair always pulled back into a half-hearted bun and clothes consisting of comfort more than fashion. Nothing like the Wanda Maximoff she has grown to know. She should feel terrible, shouldn't she? Wanda is her best friend but Agatha can't help but feel as if the pitcher had dug herself into this hole. So, why should Agatha be the one to dig her out of it?</p><p>Familiar fingers graze her outer thigh, her eyes fixing back on the screen before glancing at Rio. A soft look in her eyes shows her concern and understanding. Agatha has a love hate feeling about how easily Rio can read her.</p><p>Rio, having become a frequent guest in Agatha's apartment and the reciprocant of angry and concerned rants, knows exactly what is troubling her. Rio just wishes she could help but they've both decided Rio would do more harm than good getting between Wanda and Agatha.</p><p>So, Rio listens and offers advice when asked like any devoted girlfriend would. Agatha doesn't know what she would do without her surprisingly wise voice of reason. Over the past few weeks Rio has taken care of her and her Rio, the two of them falling into some sort of separated domesticity that Agatha has never had. Even when she was younger her childhood home had felt so sterile and sanitary, her Mother away on business leaving young Agatha with only a revolving door of housekeepers to keep her company.</p><p>Now she can't imagine spending a weekend morning without Rio cooking a mouth watering breakfast and brewing delicious Puerto Rican coffee. An afternoon filled with quiet studying sessions on the couch and soft kisses between botany explanations. An evening with beer, pizza and earth shattering orgasms.</p><p>Agatha is hooked - well and truly addicted to Rio Vidal.</p><p>Rio is no different. She bites her tongue and clenches her fist every second Wanda talks down to the brunette. Even if they don't get along, Agatha is their captain and team mate, she deserves more respect than Wanda has been giving.</p><p>Rio hesitates to fall into the comfort of Agatha. She had lost her parents in a car crash when she was young, forcing her to live with her Abuelita at the age of six. When she turned sixteen and came out to her family, she lost most of them, only Abuelita sticking by her side. From then on she has only ever had her and no one else. Every woman she has ever been with never lasted and she was okay with that, until Agatha Harkness.</p><p>So, Rio wants nothing more than to wrap her arm across Agatha’s strong shoulders and pull them flush but she restrains herself. They have been sticking to their rules the second time around. Even if Agatha teases Rio with light touches to see her muscles jump and Rio returns the favor with a knowing, promising look that sends shivers down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Tonight is no different. By the time movie night is over, Agatha had managed to slip her fingers under the pitcher's blanket to draw aimless circles against her thigh and push Rio towards exploding with desire.</p><p>“Do you need a ride back to the dorms, Vidal?” Agatha asks curiously, innocently asking one of her teammates if they need a ride home. Rio pulls on her coat, a small smile begging to cross her lips. They share a look sparking with energy only they can see.</p><p>“Isn't that out of your way, Harkness?” Jen questions suspiciously, always listening, always watching. Rio is surprised by the first baseman's interjection, feeling anxiety flash through her in seconds. She may not have a lot to lose but Agatha…</p><p>“It's nearly midnight, Jen. I'm not going to let her walk all the way back to campus alone.” Agatha bites back swiftly, having the retort saved in her back pocket for such an inquiry. She is getting better and better at swatting away Jen's ever unhelpful questions and comments. Jen twists her face with attitude instead of responding.</p><p>“How sweet.” Wanda mutters under her breath as she walks into the kitchen with an arm full of empty glasses, sarcasm and disdain dripping from each word. Agatha sends a glare her way. Rio rolls her eyes. Suddenly the kitchen is filled with tension and Wanda has the fiery red glint of the Scarlet Witch in her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, I'm leaving before the ticking time bomb explodes.” Jen says under her breath, making Alice laugh as usual. Wanda isn't laughing.</p><p>“What's that Jen? Do you have something to say?” Wanda fixes her heated gaze on the first and second baseman. The whole team stops in their tracks, sending cautious and concerned looks between them. Jen, while shocked by the sudden challenge, is not backing off so easily and squaring her shoulders</p><p>“I don't have a problem telling you the truth,” Jen steps closer as Wanda turns to face her head on, “You've been one hell of a bitch lately. The whole team is walking on eggshells around you.” Agatha feels her heart drop into her stomach when Wanda takes a step closer, eyes blazing Scarlet red.</p><p>“It's not my problem that none of you can handle a little criticism.” Wanda bites out. That earns her a few disgruntled noises from her team mates.</p><p>“Woah, woah woah,” Lilia says, quickly stepping up beside Jen and fixing the younger woman with a wicked glare, “I don't care what you're working through. You will not disrespect the entire team like that.” Typically, even Wanda doesn't want to wind up Lilia but tonight, she is feeling bold.</p><p>“I can and I will,” Wanda hisses, glaring at both women with the same red glare, “I carry this team.” Rio can't help it, a scoff leaves her lips. Agatha feels her heart drop when Wanda doesn't hesitate to turn on the rookie, always wanting to pick a fight with her.</p><p>“Always got something to say, don't you? Go ahead, rookie.” Wanda makes her voice deceptively inviting but her eyes tell a different story, a dangerous one. She's been waiting for a good reason to give the newcomer a piece of her mind and feels her veins light with excitement at the possibility. Unfortunately for Wanda, Rio has been ready for a fight like this since she got on the team.</p><p>“You limp through six innings before I step in.” Rio takes a step forward, putting herself between the redhead and the two other teammates, walking out of Agatha’s reach. Wanda is fuming, nostrils flaring with anger.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers pointedly, taking a step to follow the dark haired woman who ignores her. The two pitchers are toe to toe, inches away from one another and making the room vibrate with tension.</p><p>“And thank God I do, because by the fifth inning all you’re throwing are duds and I gotta clean the bases with the shit show-” Rio doesn't get to finish, Wanda’s hand comes across her cheek with a resounding slap.</p><p>Agatha doesn't even think before she finds herself pushing between the two women, forcing Wanda away from Rio with her own body, anger making her irrational. Wanda isn't expecting the sudden aggression, maybe hadn't even expected her own response as her hand shakes at her side, moving backwards until she is cornered by the raging captain against the kitchen counter. Agatha has never been aggressive with any of the women, verbally abusive at times, but never this. The team is in shock and there is only one variable to account for their captain's sudden protective streak against her best friend.</p><p>Rio is surprised to say the least because she didn't think the redhead had the balls to smack her. What shocks her more is the catcher who steps between her and Wanda with a purpose, a threat filling the space between the two women with the way she walks. Lilia hums softly, studying the second string pitcher curiously, it makes Rio’s skin crawl.</p><p>“You touch her- touch any woman on this team again and you will no longer be on it.” Agatha hisses. Wanda swallows roughly, shocked by Agatha's threat, the anger in her veins losing momentum and settling heavily in her stomach, feeling a lot like guilt. It gets wiped away as soon as she glances at Rio and then suddenly she has so qualms about smacking the woman. If anything, she has a desire to do more than that, a plan hatching in her head.</p><p>“Is that understood?” Agatha whispers, jaw clenching when Wanda looks away from her, over her shoulder towards the rest of the team. Her hand smacks on the kitchen counter, Wanda's eyes flashing up to her own as some of the other women gasp.</p><p>“Is that understood?” Agatha still sees the fight in Wanda’s green eyes but she takes the small nod for the temporary agreement that it is.</p><p>“Damn,” Jen whispers, joining Lilia’s curious gaze pointed at Rio. Fuck. When Agatha steps back, the other women don't hesitate to end the night, leaving the apartment silently. When the front door shuts Agatha feels her palm tingling from hitting the counter, nerves running through her body as the adrenaline seeps away. She follows after the women, keeping an eye on Rio who glances back at her with a meaningful look.</p><p>The women part ways, muttering about the events of tonight but none of them lingering. Agatha plays with her keys, waiting for Rio at her car and playing the scene over in her head. When the raven-haired woman stands in front of her Agatha finally feels her shaking hand calm.</p><p>“Let me get you home?” Rio asks softly, holding out her hand. The brunette feels relief flood through her mind because Rio knows her - really knows her, and takes care of her without asking. All Agatha wants to do is fall into her arms but that will have to wait until they're alone so she hands over her keys.</p><p>The car ride is silent besides the soft music playing through the speakers and Agatha’s foot bouncing slightly when her thoughts run rampant. Rio doesn't mind, knowing that pushing the brunette to talk about anything has never gotten her anywhere before.</p><p>As soon as they step through her apartment, Agatha tosses her jacket aside and walks towards the kitchen. She opens one of the cabinets and rifles past many new boxes, jars, and seasonings that Rio had stocked up for her to cook as she pleases, to find the bottle of vodka. Before she even turns around Rio has a hand at the small of her back and two shot glasses sliding onto the counter in front of her. Two healthy pours later and they are both taking a shot of vodka. Rio groans, a shiver daring to roll through her at the strong taste, while Agatha seems to embrace every aspect of the liquor.</p><p>“I don't know how you like this shit,” Rio mumbles, placing the shot glass back onto the counter. Agatha pours them both one more, leaning back against the counter as she slams it back. Rio moves to stand in front of the brunette, taking her glass and doing the same with a grimace. She places the glass back on the counter and waits.</p><p>Agatha meets Rio's eyes for the first time since leaving Wanda's and finds comfort in the way she moves forward, boxing her into the counter. As if Agatha would run away. She might. Feelings aren't her thing, but Rio looks at her like that, and suddenly she wants to spill her guts to the pitcher.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asks, knowing the answer considering she has personally seen the pitcher take a harder hit than that, asking anyway because Rio's cheek is still red. She reaches up to ghost her fingers across the pinked skin, notcing how close the color matches to when her cheeks flush when she's embarrassed or thoroughly fucked.</p><p>“Wanda isn't as strong as she looks.” Rio says casually, moving closer and leaning into the hand at her cheek. She can feel the difference in Agatha, blue eyes watching her with something glinting in her eyes, something Rio can't pin down.</p><p>“Don't underestimate her.” Agatha scolds, caressing the woman's cheek for a second longer before moving it to wrap around the back of her neck and lead them closer. Rio presses flush, the ledge of the counter digging into Agatha’s back. The pitcher smiles, amused and taunting.</p><p>“I can take a hit.” Rio feels the heat flaring between them when blue eyes narrow. It changes the air between them from caring and calm to hot and chaotic, similar to when they first started seeing each other. Rio knows what that glint is now - a challenge, a thirst for control and Agatha wants all of it.</p><p>“You shouldn't be taking hits,” Agatha hissed, tangling her fingers in dark locks and pulling just enough to demonstrate her frustration and make brown eyes turn black. Her thighs light with fire, control rushing through her like adrenaline as her heart beats faster.</p><p>“You shouldn't be running your mouth at all. It only gets you into trouble.” Agatha points out, her voice steady and commanding attention. Rio is hanging off of every word, a smirk curling her lips as the perfect rebuttal runs through her mind.</p><p>She tries to move closer, “You love to hear me run my mouth.” Before she can finish completely, Agatha is tugging at her hair harder to prevent her from moving forward, forcing a grunt of pain and pleasure from her lips to punctuate her scentence. Their mouths only spaced apart by a few inches now making it torture for both of them. Agatha knows what the pitcher wants but doesn't want to give in so easily, enjoying control too much. Rio glances down at soft lips, trying to nudge the brunette towards her own desires.</p><p>“I love to see you use your mouth,” Agatha husks, clarifying her statement with a sharp pull of dark hair and a hand on a strong shoulder, pushing down with a decent amount of force. Rio bites back a moan, becoming pliable as she drops carefully to her knees in front of the catcher. She could definitely get used to this side of Agatha. Her cunt is already burning with want, coating her boxers and making any friction she can get that much sweeter.</p><p>Rio moves her hands up to undress the demanding brunette.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah,” Agatha chides, running her fingers through silky hair and bringing one finger up to her mouth, tapping her lips, “Use your mouth.” Rio smiles, eyes flashing with heat as she drops her hands to strong thighs and leans forward. Agatha does assist her in one way, lifting up her shirt and tossing it aside, granting the dark-haired woman a view of her top-less form but keeping her bra on.</p><p>Rio takes her fill before turning her focus back to the waistband of legging in front of her. As is her nature, she teases the woman by placing a kiss to her covered center before her teeth actually clamp down on the edge of the material. She tugs and manages to show an inch or two of skin. Agatha feels a simple act such as breathing get a little harder, entirely distracted by Rio’s mouth doing what it does best - drive her mad.</p><p>Leggings, while thin and soft, are still skin tight, not that Rio is complaining, but her mouth can only do so much. Luckily Agatha doesn't chastise her for using her hands where the material bunches up. One foot raises after another and the leggings are pushed across the floor to be remembered later.</p><p>Rio doesn't hesitate to press a kiss to the inside of Agatha's thigh, licking a path higher to her pussy where she can smell how desperate the brunette is becoming. If the flexing fingers in her hair and twitching muscles weren't enough to go by. The lilac satin thong has a dark purple spot that Rio just has to taste. So, she does, nudging forward to urge Agatha to spread her legs and letting her tongue stiffen and swipe slowly.</p><p>Agatha tightens the fist in Rio’s hair and moans, eyelids becoming heavy as she watches. She leans back a little more as she drops her elbow to the counter behind her, curling her fingers around the ledge to ground herself. It opens her up and Rio takes what she can get.</p><p>Rio moans against wet satin, pushing her tongue across the wet material and finding her clit. Agatha experimentally rolls her hips, moaning at the pressure on her clit and feeling more arousal join the mess in her thong. Rio is easily motivated to continue and taste unrestricted, gripping the satin between her teeth and tugging down, her hands helping when needed, throwing the thong over her shoulder.</p><p>“If I knew seeing me getting smacked would make you so wet…”  Rio trails off with a smirk, starting to lean in when the hand in her hair stops her. She looks up into dark blue eyes.</p><p>“Seeing you on your knees gets me this wet.” Agatha explains swiftly, letting the other woman move forward and groans softly at the lips surrounding her clit. Rio hums softly, pulling back enough to speak and ghost her lips over her.</p><p>“Are you sure?” A slow swipe across her clit to hear Agatha moan, “You slapped me right after our first kiss.” Rio points out, sucking at her clit to take her breath away and achieving just that. Agatha feels a flush of red crawling up her neck at the memory. God, she acted so stupid.</p><p>“Then you kissed me like you wanted me to fuck you,” Rio husks, reaching up to grip Agatha's thighs, pulling one over her shoulder as she inches forward to take some of her weight and slot herself closer. Agatha gasps softly at the move, gripping her hair tighter than she means to, not that Rio minds as she moans into her pussy.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha understands where all of this woman's power comes from - her fucking mouth. With just a few words Agatha has forgotten her plan, abandoning her clear train of thought to hop onto Rio's without question.</p><p>“Leaving a pretty little wet spot on my jeans.” Rio groans at the memory, making herself drip as she remembers that night with full clarity, ready to make the brunette come on her face so hard that the wet spot will be nothing in comparison. Just as she leans forward the hand in her hair turns rough, a gasping moan dragged from her throat from the sting and her eyes flashing up towards her captain who looks more than a little peeved. Fuck.</p><p>“What did I say before?” Agatha whispers darkly. Rio feels a shiver rolling down her spine at the angry look in blue eyes and the menacing tone to accompany them.</p><p>“I like to see you use your mouth. That's what I said. So, get to work.”</p><p>Rio tries to retort, “I thought-”</p><p>“Why are you still talking?” Agatha questions swiftly, cutting off whatever wicked little innuendo the pitcher was preparing to give her. Rio’s jaw snaps closed and her chest flares with the desire to be stubborn but she doesn't get to think - only do. The hand tangled at the back of her head pulls and she finds her mouth occupied by Agatha's cunt, groaning with lust.</p><p>Holy fuck, that is hot.</p><p>Rio can't seem to find the defiant streak in herself, melting into the woman before her with a moan and mouth working diligently against her.</p><p>“Right there, sweetheart.” Agatha whispers encouragingly, the hand in dark hair pulling back, offering an out to the woman just in case she pushed too far. But in the last two seconds Rio becomes the absolute demon Agatha has come to love and refuses to put even a centimeter between her mouth and Agatha’s pussy, moaning happily as she does so.</p><p>Rio moans deeply, mind going blank and her mouth working against the brunette with a purpose. Her left hand squeezes the thigh on her shoulder and reaches forward with her right hand to bring two fingers under her chin. Her whimper is muffled when Agatha pulls at her hair just enough to get her attention but not to pull her away.</p><p>“I said use your mouth, not your fingers.” Agatha hisses, wanting nothing more than to take those skilled fingers but enjoying the feral look in hazel eyes too much. Rio groans, displeased but following her orders, moving her hand to the back of the leg still standing.</p><p>“Maybe if you're good,” A moan leaves her lips, her hips bucking for friction, “You can fuck me with your fingers later.” She groans loudly when devious lips attach to her clit, making her knees shake. The promise must be enough of a selling point because Rio doubles her efforts and Agatha feels like she might collapse.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio - right there - stay right there.” Agatha moans, rolling her hips forward to grind her clit against Rio's tongue. The raven haired woman releases a muffled yet obscene moan that makes Agatha smile through the bliss. Her head drops back on her shoulders, another loud moan crawling unrestrained from her chest as she rolls her hips closer and closer toward her orgasm. Rio places one hand on her ass, encouraging her to grind harder, to take more - use her. The thought alone sends Agatha over the edge.</p><p>It takes her by surprise, a gasp working through her moans and her hips stuttering and jerking to keep on pace. Rio takes over, stroking her clit with languid swipes of her tongue. Agatha crumbles and struggles to hold herself up, gripping the counter with white knuckles.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck - Rio!” Agatha groans, legs shaking and the woman between her thighs refusing to give any reprieve. She rides through her orgasm on shaky legs and a hand gripping tightly at Rio's hair. Her moans and gasps for breath fill her ears as she shakes uncontrollably.</p><p>Rio moans and groans against her girlfriend, devouring her pussy with unchecked lust. It clouds her brain, her tongue working skillfully against her throbbing clit as the bottom half of her face becomes drenched in arousal. She doesn't stop, digging her fingers into Agatha's tight ass to keep her against her mouth.</p><p>“R-Rio, wait- fuck - I can't-” A gasp slices through Agatha's words as a second orgasm races down her spine, her eyes rolling back into her head and her other hand flying down to tangle in Rios hair. Fireworks burst behind her eyes as she wobbles, pulling the mouth against her as close as possible as her walls flutter and beg for something to squeeze.</p><p>“Holy fucking shit,” Agatha whimpers, leaning heavily onto the counter behind her as her back arches in climax. Every muscle is tense and straining as the waves crash over her.</p><p>Rio nearly growls into her, fingers twitching to be surrounded by Agatha but staying on her flexing ass instead. When hands begin to yank her back she leaves with a parting suck of her throbbing clit. Agatha gasps for breath, throwing her hips back and out of reach of the ravenous woman. She groans softly when she clenches around nothing, regretting her decision to tease Rio instead of taking her fingers. Her knee feels like it's about to give but Rio places her other foot back on the ground seconds before standing to keep her stable. Agatha wraps her arms around the pitcher's shoulders as she panted for breath. Rio smiles, taking in the disheveled, fucked out woman before her with a prideful smirk.</p><p>“Don't tell me you're done,” Rio husks, licking her lips and wiping the rest of the arousal off her face with the back of her hand. Agatha groans softly, her legs still shaky but the need inside of her burning hot for one thing.</p><p>“Get the new strap on, and get on the bed.” Agatha breathes out. Rio grunts softly, just the idea of endless possibilities the toy brings is sending her diving head first into the pool of lust that she lives in around Agatha. With a heated look, she leaves the brunette to search for the strap on.</p><p>Once they spent one two many nights at Agatha’s apartment without a strap on, she bought her own to keep handy. They haven't used it yet but she loves to point out the slightly larger length and girth compared to Rio's. The targeted teasing had started a few passionate rolls under the sheets.</p><p>Agatha finally catches her breath and regains movement in her legs to make her way towards the bed. Rio has stripped out of her clothes entirely, wearing nothing but the harness and black doldo jutting from her hips. The ache inside of her intensifies at the sight, crawling onto the bed. Rio bites her lip to keep a moan in her throat as she watches Agatha move closer.</p><p>“I knew you could make good use of that mouth of yours.” Agatha leans down, keeping their eyes locked as she places a kiss against the tip of the dildo. Rio’s jaw goes slack, eyes glazing over with desire. Agatha smirks at the lack of rebuttal from the pitcher.</p><p>“Lay all the way back,” Agatha instructs, leaning back on her heels as Rio shifts down the bed. When she is settled Agatha climbs on top of her, straddling her hips and bracketing the dildo with her thighs. The toy presses against the sensitive lips of her pussy but it only drives her hips forward for more. Rio’s hands land on her hips to bring her down to grind against the toy but Agatha isn’t having it. She takes her wrists and pins them above her head. Rio frowns with a huff of frustration.</p><p>“Agatha.” God, Rio sounds so whiny. It takes everything Agatha has not to jump right onto the cock and ride until they both come. She needs Rio to keep her hands to herself. Agatha spots her robe hanging off the corner of the headboard and gets an idea. She leans forward and snags the sash from the flimsy belt loops, swiftly wrapping the silk around Rio’s wrist.</p><p>Rio cranes her neck to look up at her hands, “Wh- Oh, come on.” Rio groans, actually pouting now. Agatha ties the sash to the headboard with a smirk. She looks down at Rio, taking her jaw in her grasp as she connects their eyes.</p><p>“Good?” Agatha questions, the pitcher nodding her head with her grasp, “Do you want a safe word?” Rio smiles widely.</p><p>“Do I need one?” Excitement flashing in Rio’s eyes as she settles into the mattress. Agatha rolls her eyes, of course Rio likes this. Not much of a punishment for wandering hands.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha decides swiftly. She leans back, settling on strong thighs and wiggling her hips against the dildo. Rio moans softly as she looks between them.</p><p>“Wanda.” Rio answers quickly. Agatha stops immediately and looks at the woman in disbelief. Rio smirks when her eyes move back up to the brunette. Blue eyes narrow dangerously.</p><p>“That is not your safe word,” Agatha hisses.</p><p>“Yes, it is.” Rio states matter of factly, tilting her head just slightly and raising her eyebrows in question, “Just think - when in the hell would I be screaming Wanda’s name as we fuck? I can’t think of a single point in time I would be buried deep in your-” Agatha’s hand slaps over Rio’s mouth, a smirk pressing into her palm.</p><p>“You’re insufferable.” Agatha groans, sneaking her other hand between them. “Maybe I should gag you too?” She teases as she grabs the dildo and pushes down. Rio moans against her hand, eyes rolling back in her head, hands make fists around the metal headboard as pleasure engulfs her body.</p><p>See, there is something special about this toy. The wearer has an insert, only four inches of length curled just right to hit the pleasurable little spot inside of them. Agatha thought it might make things more enjoyable for the raven haired woman. Instead of being painfully aroused, she might just be able to come with the harness on.</p><p>“Like that idea, do you?” Agatha taunts, enjoying the silence and filling it with her own suggestions. Rio groans with a short nod, bucking up into the friction on her clit and the movement inside of her, opening her eyes to see the brunette’s pleased smile. She sighs and narrows her eyes. Agatha relents, taking back her hand from Rio’s mouth but continuing to stroke the dildo.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, get on my dick already.” Rio hisses, her hands trying to jerk down out of instinct. The little tug the pitcher gives to her bindings makes Agatha smile.</p><p>“Oh, honey, if you’re gonna speak,” Agatha drawls slowly, looking between them and swiping at the wetness between her thighs before taking the dildo back into her hand, coating the silicone with her own arousal, “you better use nicer words.” Rio bites into her bottom lip, breathing heavier as Agatha starts using a rougher hand now that the toy is slick.</p><p>Rio definitely loves this version of Agatha.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, who are you and what have you done with my girlfriend?” Rio looks back up into blue eyes. Agatha feels her chest tighten at the word ‘girlfriend’, loving the way it sounds coming from sweet, pouty lips. She smirks, shifting forward and placing the dildo at her entrance, bringing her lips to ghost over the other woman’s.</p><p>“It’s still me, Rio,” She husks softly, nipping playfully at pleasure bitten lips, “I just want to see how long I can fuck myself on your cock before you’re begging me to make you come.” At the end of her sentence, Agatha is dropping down onto the dildo, sliding it inside of herself with a groan of pleasure and discomfort from the stretch.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio chokes out as she closes her eyes, feeling the pressure against her clit and the insert pushing deeper. Agatha moans, taking her lips in a slow, wet kiss. Rio struggles to breathe when the dildo bottoms out inside of the brunette and rubs perfectly against her. How has she never tried a strap on like this before? Agatha begins a steady rhythm, moving her hips back down to take every inch. Finally, the ache inside of her is satiated - for now.</p><p>“You feel so good.” The last words leave her with a moan. Rio echoes it, finding her footing once she can breathe again and pushing up to meet the catcher’s bouncing hips. Agatha gasps, one hand pushing back down on Rio’s abs to keep her against the bed.</p><p>“I didn’t tell you to move.” Agatha husks strongly, dropping again, a little harder this time to get her point across. Rio moans as pleasure shoots up her spine and nods her head quickly, agreeing to anything.</p><p>“No moving - sure, I can do that. Oh, God.” Rio feels her hips twitch. Maybe not. Agatha chuckles darkly.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha mocks the same tone Rio used earlier, grinding on a downwards stroke. Rio looks like she’s going to lose it but nods her head anyway. It makes Agatha enjoy it all the more, releasing a moan of her own and watching Rio watch her. The pitcher’s hips jerk slightly, enough for the captain to notice and another knowing, dark chuckle to escape the woman.</p><p>Rio decides to be truthful, “Ugh, I can't - Agatha, God. It feels so good,” She whimpers, tries to choke it back down but it's too late. The brunette moans and runs her hands up the pitcher’s abs to cup her breasts, thumbing over her nipples. Rio arches into her touch.</p><p>“You look so pretty tied up for me.” Agatha breathes out, shaking her head at the view she has the privilege of seeing. Rio groans, biting her lip and bucking up for more friction. Agatha doesn't stop her this time.</p><p>“You're not going to come until I say so. Got it?” Agatha says sternly, gripping Rio's jaw in her hand and making the woman look at her clearly. A whine leaves the other woman at the thought of her orgasm being withheld but one glare and roll of her hips turns the defiant woman to mush.</p><p>“Yes, yes - just keep moving.” Rio is basically pleading at this point. Agatha is happy to oblige, her own orgasm coils inside of her as she picks up the pace. Her hands plant themselves on the other woman’s breasts, using the leverage to move harder and faster.</p><p>“Shit, Rio,” Agatha mutters, shocked that her orgasm is creeping up her spine already, “Imagine if you could use your hands.” Rio grunts out of frustration when her hands flex and jerk against the silk surrounding her wrists. Her efforts only tighten the material. Agatha smiles and moves harder, the dildo dragging deliciously along her fluttering walls and reaching that sweet spot inside of her.</p><p>“Let me use my hands,” Rio requests breathlessly, fingers itching for the chance to grab Agatha anywhere she can reach her. Her hips move faster, desperately trying to take more. The brunette moans appreciatively at the new pace but shakes her head.</p><p>“Uh, uh sweetheart. I’m not done with you yet.” Agatha rejects the request. Rio huffs and brings her eyes up to look at Agatha. She will never get tired of seeing her on top. Rio may have the control more often than not but having Agatha squirming and bucking on top of her makes her wonder how quickly she could lose such power.</p><p>Suppose she has her answer, seconds. Mere seconds had passed before Rio gave into the captain, letting her take her pleasure and bring Rio careening toward the edge of her own.</p><p>Speaking of.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m gonna come,” Rio grits out, straining to suddenly keep her hips still, trying to delay the inevitable. The brunette doesn’t falter, picking up the slack with a brutal pace.</p><p>Is she fucking ignoring her?</p><p>Agatha moans, dropping forward to fist the sheets on either side of the pitcher's head, a curtain of curly brown hair trapping them in their own little world. Their sweat slicked skin slides across each other. Panting breath fills the space between them along with their curses and moans. Agatha loves seeing Rio crumble - loves hearing it even more. So, she keeps going despite the pitcher's warning.</p><p>“I can’t hold off much longer, baby. Holy fuck. I can't-” Rio tries to warn the woman, sticking true to her promise, when a hand wraps around her throat, fingertips pressing into the sides of her neck. A weak, desperate sounding moan leaves her lips.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>Okay, who knew she would be into that. Agatha gasps, her hips stuttering in pace as she comes closer to the edge. She watches Rio’s eyes turn black, clouded with lust and pure pleasure. That gives her enough of an answer - Rio likes to be choked. Go figures. Agatha smiles, feral and smug as she tightens her grip.</p><p>Rio doesn’t have a single inkling of humility or embarrassment in her mind - unable to feel anything but ecstasy. The vision of Agatha moaning and grinding onto the dildo strapped around her hips while a hand sits so prettily wrapped around Rio’s throat - yeah, she is inching towards the point of no return.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio chokes out, hips shaking with restraint. She is getting too fucking close to stop now. Jesus christ, when was the last time she was fucking edged like this? Never. No one but Agatha Harkness could even fathom tying Rio to the bed and fucking herself with a dildo ratcheted around her hips and a hand curled around her throat telling her not to come. The grip around her throat tightens and the brunette locks their eyes before saying the filthiest thing Rio has ever heard.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up and let me ride your cock, sweetheart.” Agatha hisses, pleasure coiling in her gut so tight that her orgasm explodes within seconds of her words. Power leaching into her and sending her flying over the edge. Rio is going to fall apart. If it wasn't for Agatha’s hips jerking to a halt, stalling with the dildo buried deep inside of her, the pitcher would’ve cracked.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio.” Agatha whimpers as she collapses forward with a near sob of relief, burying her head in the other woman’s neck as she rides out her orgasm. The new angle brings their bodies flush and Agatha holds on tight, grounding herself with a hand in dark hair. Rio focuses on breathing and keeping her hips still - anything to keep herself from falling over the edge like the brunette told her not to. Agatha catches her breath and plants soft kisses along the sweaty skin of her girlfriend’s neck. Rio releases a whimper.</p><p>“Agatha, I am going to fucking die if you don’t fuck me right now.” Rio whispers in a dangerously soft and almost pained whisper. Agatha smiles in amusement, only barely having caught her breath before she begins moving her hips in a slow grind. Rio’s breath catches and her hands try to move down to either stop the movement or encourage her to move more, she doesn't know. Her swollen clit throbs against the silicone as she drips around the other end - borderline overstimulated.</p><p>Agatha, her hand tightening around Rio’s slender throat once again, brings her mouth up to the pitcher’s ear, “Beg.” Karma's a bitch and the tables have turned - Agatha is going to milk as much of this control as she can.</p><p>One whisper. One command. One little word drives Rio into groveling.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Rio gushes with a breath, her twitching hips snapping up for more friction and moaning loudly when she feels it, “Fuck yourself on my cock until I’m shaking, baby. Please, I need it - I need you, Agatha. Don’t make me wait - please.” Rio has no shame, her hips jogging up in a jerky, pitiful rhythm.</p><p>Agatha is feeling particularly evil today and not exactly ready to relinquish control just yet, “I'm the only woman who can fuck you like this?” Rio moans and nods her head without a second thought. She is going to burst.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio hisses through clenched teeth, feeling her cunt trembling around the dildo.</p><p>Agatha tightens her grip on Rios throat a little harder, “Tell me, honey, am I the only woman that's fucked you into a desperate, pathetic fucking mess?” Those dirty, filthy degrading words slip right down her spine and feed the heat in her gut.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha. Only you - please.” Rio digs her nails into her palms, knuckles white and hands cramping from her grip on the metal rails. Agatha smiles because Rio Vidal looks and sounds absolutely wrecked. Fucked out and desperate. It's a good look on her.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t hesitate, tugging on the end of the sash around Rio’s hands to release them, “Make yourself come for me, Rio.” The raven haired woman is already wrapping her hands around Agatha’s hips and planting her heels into the mattress. Rio’s grip is tight, bruising even, Agatha hopes she leaves marks. Rio’s snapping hips find a punishing rhythm with ease when her hands find purchase.</p><p>“Oh God.” Agatha hisses, her hands surrounding Rio’s shoulders when she releases her throat and holding her close as she moans. Her sensitive cunt clenches, fluttering and milking the dildo, threatening to send her head first into another orgasm. A shocked moan leaves her lips as she rockets towards her fourth climax.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whines, eyes shut tight and chest heaving with each breath as her orgasm crests, “Fuck me, I'm gonna come. Fuck, baby.” Curses and moans spew from her lips to get lost in the skin of Agatha’s neck. Her hips stutter as she comes undone, throbbing against the base of the silicone and squeezing the insert inside of her. Agatha grits out a curse, shaking as her orgasm washes over her, the tension in her body as tight as a fucking bow when she finally feels release.</p><p>Heavy breathing and moans fill the space between them when Rio drops her hips back to the bed. Agatha groans, the move dropping her hips as well and pushing her to take the rest of the dildo, forcing a shudder through Rio.</p><p>“Don’t move,” Rio requests softly, her voice breathless and rough, “I’ll fucking explode.” Agatha laughs, her nails digging into soft skin and muscle as the action has her squeezing around the dildo still inside of her. Her laugh is contagious and Rio can’t help but let out her own chuckle with a finishing groan.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, take this thing out of me?” Rio asks softly. Agatha hums in agreement, lifting her head and placing soft kisses across her chest before sliding off of the dildo. Rio groans and reaches down to pop open the clasp of the buckle, Agatha helping pull the insert from inside of her. The strap on gets tossed aside and the catcher falls next to the pitcher with a soft groan. Agatha can already feel the soreness in her muscles and between her thighs.</p><p>“God damn,” Rio whispers, a bright, blissful smile on her face. Agatha chuckles softly as she moves to curl into Rio's side, head on her shoulder and arm around her waist.</p><p>“We're really good, huh?” Agatha compliments them, drawing a laugh from the woman below her.</p><p>“I…I think you're better than me.” Rio frowns at the thought.</p><p>“Well, duh,” Agatha replies out of habit, stroking her fingernails across Rio’s sweat slicked abs to see her muscles twitch, “Better than you at what?” Agatha asks in confusion. Rio lets out a bark of laughter.</p><p>“You don’t even know?” Rio points out and feels the catcher shake her head against her chest where her hand filters through the wild mess of brown strands, “Sex, baby, I think you’re better at sex than me.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, “As happy as it would make me to claim that title - it isn’t even a contest.” She wonders how many other women could say that Rio Vidal was the best fuck of their lives. Too many faces blur together in her mind.</p><p>“Agatha, I swear you just made me see God himself,” Rio says sincerely. Agatha rolls her eyes at the younger woman’s dramatics and sits up, running her hand anxiously through her hair. In seconds the energy in the room shifts.</p><p>“You’re my first. I’m you’re -” She cuts herself off because ugh she hates to think of the women Rio has slept with, “who cares how many - you’re my first and I’ve just barely managed to learn how to- I mean the experience alone-” She's spiraling.</p><p>“Oh, shut up.” Rio groans, sitting up and very quickly pulling the brunette into a filthy kiss that does in fact shut her up. Agatha melts into it, their tongues tangling and Rio guiding her back down to the bed, grounding her. Breathless and thoroughly turned on again - Agatha breaks the kiss for air. Rio doesn’t let her move far, keeping her captive with a hand on her jaw and locking their eyes.</p><p>“If I hear you talk about yourself like that - like you don’t surpass every standard a woman possibly could - then I will tie you to the bed,” Rio smiles, teasing and filled with warmth as she drops her eyes to look at Agatha’s lips, ghosting her finger over them in adoration when she helplessly smiles back, “and I won’t let you leave until you see what I see.”</p><p>Agatha swallows roughly as her smile drops, “What do you see?”</p><p>Rio frowns softly, almost sad that Agatha can't see herself but Rio is happy to show her. She settles in, propping her head up in her hand as she looks over the brunette.</p><p>“I see a disciplined, loved and respected softball captain,” Rio begins slowly, thinking over her words as she holds the woman’s gaze. “I see a straight A student who works through the night to stay on top,” Agatha smiles a little bit at that because they both know Agatha is the top student in their classes and Rio is second, a fact she taunts her with at every opportunity. Rio likes to point out that she is always a very close second.</p><p>“I see a beautiful woman who gives me the most mind blowing orgasms of my life - ruining me for anyone else on so many levels.” Rio’s lips had started off as a smirk but the feelings in her chest feel so fucking heavy and it makes her smirk fade. Agatha spots that special little glint in Rio’s dark eyes, the glint she can’t pin down and begins to wonder about it a little more now.</p><p>Agatha reaches up to cup Rio’s cheek and pull their lips together. Things she doesn’t trust herself to say pouring into the kiss. She doesn’t know how long it lasts but when they part it is slow and natural, soft breaths filling the space between their lips.</p><p>“Do you know what I need?” Agatha husks, her voice deep and sultry, a grin shining back at her.</p><p>“Tell me,” Rio whispers back, eager to comply with any request, teasing her lips against Agatha before they kiss once more. The brunette brings her lips to the pitcher’s ear.</p><p>“Ice cream.” Agatha smiles as a deep, lustful groan reaches her ears. Rio Vidal’s kryptonite, of all things, is ice cream. Ever since the catcher had discovered the guilty pleasure she makes sure to keep a tub of chocolate ice cream in her freezer. Sometimes it baffles her how different things between them had started, with glares and arguments to soft kisses and ice cream at midnight.</p><p>“You wicked woman.” Rio drops her lips to Agatha’s neck, sucking and biting a harsh red mark into her skin as the woman tries to squirm away. Retribution for igniting her sweet tooth craving. She jumps from the bed before Agatha can grab onto her, snagging her emerald green boxers from the floor and grabbing a white tank top out of Agatha’s drawers.</p><p>“Wait for me,” Agatha huffs, abandoning the robe she normally wears, unsure where the sash went after their activities, and pulling on Rio’s plaid green flannel instead. Rio smiles and leads them into the kitchen where she pulls out the mugs, Agatha can’t stand the fact she eats ice cream out of mugs despite Rio’s very smart reasoning, and the ice cream from the freezer.</p><p>Agatha watches in silence, loving how the pitcher looks so beautiful in her kitchen. She loves a lot of things, she thinks. How Rio knows her way around the kitchen better than Agatha who literally lives there. When she ‘borrows’ her clothes just to never give them back. The captain is positive she will never see that tank top again unless she takes it back. Which can be arranged.</p><p>“You look good in my tank top,” Agatha compliments as she steps closer, wrapping her arm around Rio’s waist as the other hand rests on her hip. She keeps her lips busy memorizing any available skin she can reach. Rio hums softly in thought, very concentrated on scooping ice cream and only sort of ignoring Agatha’s very distracting mouth.</p><p>“You think I look good in everything.” Rio points out, twisting slightly, but never peeling from Agatha’s grasp, to get two spoons. Agatha smiles with a soft hum of agreement because it's true. She twists around with two mugs full of rich chocolate ice cream.</p><p>“Because you do - it’s unfair. Criminal, truly - almost as criminal as ice cream in mugs.” Agatha says strongly, taking a mug anyway.</p><p>“You love it.” Rio smiles and takes a large scoop of ice cream into her mouth. The captain sighs and shakes her head at the act. Add it to the list, Agatha thinks to herself. The clink of metal spoons in ceramic mugs fill the quiet kitchen.</p><p>“So, earlier,” Rio begins lamely, glancing into blue eyes before she continues, nerves flaring through her at the suspicious look she receives, “while it was insanely hot and very chivalrous,” Agatha narrows her gaze into a glare, forcing Rio to push out the rest of her thought before she gets yelled at, “you might’ve come to my rescue a little too quickly.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, “I know.” She takes a slightly bigger scoop of ice cream to dissuade the embarrassing emotions from her actions. It doesn't help. She knows she went too far getting into Wanda’s space but she really didn't have a choice. Wanda smacked Rio, as their team captain and sort of best friend and girlfriend, Agatha couldn't let that go unchecked. She would've done it for any of the women. It just happened to be Rio.</p><p>“Lilia noticed,” Rio says the words slowly, gauging Agatha’s relegation, blue eyes flashing bright with concern. Suddenly her ice cream doesn't taste so good. She swallows roughly.</p><p>“Jen too.” Rio says softly. Agatha's eyes widen almost comically and the raven haired woman prepares for the aftermath. Agatha sets down her mug and replays the scene in her head, brow furrowing.</p><p>“I didn't think that I…” Agatha trails off, confusing etching her face. Rio clears her throat and sets her own mug aside, assigning herself to her own little Agatha Harkness Containment Bureau to prevent any sort of suspicion that could cause doubt in their relationship. She's worried that if Agatha thinks too hard about this, they'll come to an end - again. It has worked so far, Rio always able to talk the brunette off a ledge.</p><p>“Listen, they're just suspicious right now. Right? They don't have any evidence that I fuck you into the mattress then make breakfast in the morning.” Some logic, humor and crude language gets the job done. The brunette’s furrowed brow relaxes, sort of, turning more into an annoyed scowl. The concern in her eyes flying away to be replaced with an unimpressed look and a hint of adoration the brunette would refuse to admit is even there but Rio sees it. She moves closer, pressing their lips together and not moving away until warm hands are sliding onto her jaw and ending the kiss.</p><p>“Finish your ice cream before it melts,” Agatha whispers, a small smile on her lips. Rio pulls away, grabbing her mug of ice cream with a smile of her own.</p><p>“It won't melt,” Rio points out quickly, licking her spoon and smirking as blue eyes follow the lewd act, “do you know why it won't?” The tone of Rio's voice is too smug and despite the distraction of how the pitcher's tongue moves so swiftly to gather the dripping ice cream from her spoon, Agatha knows exactly where she's going with that question.</p><p>Rio answers for her, “Because it's in a mug.”</p><p>The captain rolls her eyes, hates that the smile on Rio's face gives her butterflies even still, “Shut up, Rio.”</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Wanda is late to practice, looking exhausted and nauseated. Herb gives her one glance before turning to his Captain with a sigh.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell is Maximoff doing?” Herb asks, concerned for his starting pitcher. Agatha looks over at the redhead with her own sigh. Wanda looks like shit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How should I know?” Agatha retorts quickly, hoping the responsibility doesn't land on her shoulders. No such luck. Herb faces her more directly with a stern look in his eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> the captain of this team?” Herb asks rhetorically, crossing his arms as Agatha avoids his eyes so he tilts his head to look at her face, “Are you </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> the catcher for our starting pitcher?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans softly, her gaze flickering back to the redhead who looks absolutely pained when jogging out to the field to join the others. If Agatha had to guess, Wanda's been drinking and partying, and if she's smart - not going anywhere near drugs. Because if Wanda thinks her life is upside down </span><em><span>now</span></em><span> - being kicked off of the team and out of University from a positive drug test would really make her land on her ass. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda has been struggling to accept Rio as her replacement when she can’t get the outs.” Agatha admits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit,” Herb scoffs, shaking his head as he looks back out at the women running laps, “I've had her in my office every other practice trying to convince me to keep her in the game - and on top of that? Her parents are calling the president’s office and putting pressure on my shoulder because of it.” Agatha’s eyebrows jump up in shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sure, the Maximoff’s have some pull considering they have an entire wing of the chemistry building dedicated to themselves. Not to mention, their only son, Wanda’s twin, Pietro Maximoff is a well known drug dealer on campus and still ‘</span><em><span>attends</span></em><span>’ classes. As much as a stoner can. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did you say?” Agatha asks curiously.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not here to coach Wanda, I’m here to coach the team.” Herb answers calmly. Agatha can’t help it, she lets out a little snort at the thought. The Maximoff’s couldn't have liked hearing </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well,” Agatha begins softly, impressed with Herb’s ability to stand his ground, “You’re not wrong there.” The man grunts softly with distaste, just shaking his head at the thought of the conversation that awaits him down the line. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know Wanda has always been my top pick-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But Rio is better.” It took Agatha a while to admit that but it is true. Wanda can’t match Rio’s level no matter how hard she tries. Blue eyes lock onto the raven haired woman, easily beating out the rest of the team to the finish line at home base. The sweat dripping down Rio’s neck is insanely distracting - knowing brown eyes even more so. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio is better,” Herb agrees with a slow nod, looking back at the brunette beside him, “It might get the president up my ass but Rio is going to be starting the next game.” Agatha’s eyes flash over to him in surprise. A sense of pride fills her with the thought of Rio getting what she wants - what she so clearly </span><em><span>deserves</span></em><span>. Dread quickly consumes those thoughts because it means Wanda will surely make everyone’s lives a living hell. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You think it’s a bad idea.” Herb sighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Agatha responds quickly, too quickly because Herb raises an amused eyebrow in her direction, deciding to ignore him, “Rio is good. She won’t let us down.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not worried about her,” Herb says with a heavy sigh as he begins walking towards the group, his eyes locked in on the redhead currently glaring daggers at anyone willing to meet her eyes. Agatha takes a spot beside Rio in the huddle and probably stands closer than she should. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When practice ends Herb pulls Wanda aside as the team gets their things together. Agatha feels her heart drop into her chest when the Scarlet Witch narrows her glare on Rio’s unknowing back. The woman doesn’t dwindle her glare when it shifts back to Herb and Sharon, her voice rising quickly. Agatha leaves Rio’s side with a quick and meaningful look. She isn’t looking forward to this but she won’t let Herb and Sharon take all the heat. Agatha is the captain after all. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“...some rookie bitch to take my spot? I've got scouts coming to see me. You can't just give my spot away! I've earned it!” Wanda hisses, standing up to Herb as tall as she can.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You earned it but so has Rio and right now, she is the only one getting the outs we need to win.” Herb responds calmly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, please. I’ve been closing out games since my first year here - nothing has changed besides that cocky bitch-” Wanda growls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Watch it, Maximoff.” Agatha says slowly. Wanda spins on her best friend, </span><em><span>ex-best friend</span></em><span>, with her glare only growing hotter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll say what I damn well please about the fucking </span><em><span>snake</span></em><span> who stole my bestfriend and my starting spot.” Wanda lets the venom lace her word as she walks closer towards the brunette. Agatha taking her own step forward.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ladies, come on now. Let’s be civil.” Sharon tries to get between the two women, shying away from Wanda when her glare drops to the assistant coach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio didn’t steal anything Wanda. Don’t forget how long I’ve known you.” Agatha hisses back, angry but staying calm, “You’ve lost your edge - wincing with every damn pitch, prepared to throw your arm out just to make a half-decent pitch. You need a break before you throw yourself into a surgery.” Wanda shakes out her arm as soon as the brunette brings it up, because yes, it has been killing her but she thought she was hiding it well. To everyone </span><em><span>but</span></em><span> her best friend and catcher.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that true?” Herb asks in concern, no longer worried about the explosive personality of his pitcher but the state of her well being. Wanda huffs, dialing down her anger with a sidelong glance at Agatha before turning to her head coach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine.” Wanda says shortly, telling Herb all he needs to know. He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus, Wanda, how did you expect to stay on top if your elbow starts snapping ligaments?” The question is rhetorical but Wanda opens her mouth anyway, Herb holds up a hand to stop her, “Sharon, take Wanda to the sports medicine building.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Herb says sternly as he pins the young woman with a heated glare, “I will not have you throwing out your arm to prove a point. You’re benched until I say otherwise.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve got to be fucking joking.” Wanda growls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m dead serious Maximoff. You don’t come off that bench until I have a letter from sports medicine telling me you can throw a pitch without ending your career. Got it?” Herb hisses back, his patience running thin. Wanda lets out an indignant laugh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t you know who my parents are? Who my family is?” Wanda whispers dangerously low, threats dripping from her words like blood. Agatha wants so badly to interject but she bites her tongue. Leave it to a Maximoff to threaten a faculty member. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha remembers Pietro pulling the same move to get a passing grade in a class they had in their first year. It made Agatha just as sick to see Wanda use the pitiful tactic as it did to see Pietro use it back then. What’s worse? Wanda had agreed with her about how pathetic it was to drop to that level of disgrace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb’s jaw clenched as he crossed his arms in front of him, standing his ground with ease. “Yes, and I look forward to explaining your state of injury and unsportsman-like attitude in complete detail to both them and the president of the University if you decide that is the way you want this to play out.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is fucking impressed. She has seen stronger men and women melt into a puddle of compliance and fear with the threat of the Maximoff empire coming for them. Wanda looks like she’s about to rip her hair out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, dear. Off we go.” Sharon urges Wanda away. The redhead huffs out her anger, muttering something under her breath as she sends a deadly glare to both her head coach and captain. Nonetheless, Wanda leads the way to the sports medicine building after ripping out of Sharon’s grasp. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You probably just lost your job,” Agatha muses softly. Herb actually lets out a small laugh, drawing a smile across both of their faces. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, probably.” Herb agrees with a sigh, “You didn’t tell me she was hurting.” Agatha feels guilty for that. It is one of Herb’s cardinal principals, a player never plays hurt. No injuries are allowed on the field. It was a rough adjustment at first, most of the women having played with injuries while in high school, but Agatha understood when she found out why he has a rule like that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb had a rough hit when he played catcher in college, his chest felt tight but his coach made him stay on the field. Next thing he knew, he was on his back in the dirt with paramedics shocking him with an AED to get him back. Who was going to argue with him then? Certainly not Agatha who now has a small fear of getting a heart attack while covering home base. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…” Agatha trails off searching for the right answer, “I was trying to give her time, to reel it back in and play like she used to. I was trying to-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You were being a friend.” Herb points out swiftly. Agatha sighs heavily, rubbing at the back of her neck in an attempt to get rid herself of all the tension there. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I guess I was. Not that it got me anywhere.” Agatha admits in a murmur. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I need a captain from now on.” Herb looks her in the eyes, sincere and trusting. “Rio is the best pitcher I’ve seen in years and I’m not going to let her burn out so I need your help. Keep an eye on her.” Agatha feels her chest tighten at the praise and obvious concern he has for the newcomer. She is relieved to know he sees that special quality in Rio, possibly more than Agatha does, and strives to protect it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Coach.” Agatha responds quickly. Herb nods his head towards the locker rooms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go on. Do whatever it is you do to unwind. I’ll see you at the game tomorrow.” The older man starts walking back towards the dugout to gather his things. Agatha feels some tension leave her shoulders. With an exhaustive sigh, she trudges to the locker room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everything okay?” Rio whispers when Agatha stands in front of her locker beside her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell you later?” Agatha whispers softly, eyes softening when Rio gives her a swift nod of agreement. Practice is finished and Agatha can’t think of anything better than a shower. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio leaves the locker room before her, heading back to her dorm for a change of clothes before ultimately returning to Agatha’s apartment. The captain is on her way out of the empty locker room, already melting at the thought of a scalding hot shower, possibly with her girlfriend if she can time it right, when Wanda storms in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks for nothing, </span><em><span>Captain</span></em><span>,” Wanda hisses as she throws her shoulder into the brunette’s. Agatha barely moves with the hit but it gets the redhead’s point across well enough and it starts a fire in her gut. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know Herb’s rules. You’re lucky I didn’t pull you weeks ago.” Agatha retorts, spinning on her heel as she feels the adrenaline rush through her system. Wanda laughs, throwing her head back to release a cackle into the empty locker room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Please</span></em><span>, don’t pretend like you’re not trying to get your new best friend her starting spot. I bet you’ve been planning it for a while.” Wanda growls, opening her locker so strongly it clunks into the adjacent locker with a reverberating sound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Herb decided to pull you before I said a single thing about your arm because you’ve been pitching like shit.” Agatha tightens her grip on the strap over her shoulder. Wanda’s glowing red eyes turn on her as the redhead stalks closer, Agatha standing her ground, until they are only inches apart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When did you switch teams, huh?” Wanda’s question is eerily calm and deceptively curious. Panic flares in Agatha’s chest, her glare wavering, because </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> could Wanda know about her and Rio? They have been </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> careful. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Team Maximoff became Team</span><em><span> Vidal</span></em><span> real fucking quick. One bad inning and suddenly I’m not your pitcher anymore. I’m benched because you didn’t have my back.” Relief quenches the fire in her chest, thankful that Wanda is still well and truly the narcissistic bitch she had become friends with. Agatha doesn’t know how in the hell she hadn’t seen this side of her friend before. How many people did she treat like this?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t blame that on me, Wanda.” Agatha mutters dangerously. Wanda’s eyes light with anger and something darker. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I blame the bitch attached to your hip, filling your head with nonsense. She’ll get what’s coming to her - the cocky piece of shit deserves a reality check.” Wanda looks too smug, too sincere, and it makes Agatha react wildly, falling into the chaotic reality of Wanda Maximoff. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha pushes the redhead into the lockers with a thud, surprising them both. Her hands return to her sides, reeling her anger back in with a frustrated breath puffing past her lips. “Get your shit together Wanda. I’m done cleaning up your messes.” Agatha doesn’t wait for a response, turning on her heel and heading out of the locker rooms with Wanda’s angered cry and slamming lockers to accompany her departure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is on autopilot as she drives home, brain working furiously to break down every aspect of their fight. She doesn’t even realize Rio is standing outside of her apartment until she is a foot away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was thinking I'd cook you some- What’s wrong?” Rio asks in concern, noticing Agatha’s clear shift in demeanor and feeling her chest tighten with a plethora of feelings because of it. The brunette looks up and feels tears stinging her eyes at the look the other woman gives her. She opens her mouth but speaking doesn’t feel possible right now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, let’s get you inside. Maybe take a shower?” Agatha could cry at how understanding and soft Rio is with her. When they first met, Agatha would’ve bet there wasn’t a side of the raven haired woman that wasn’t sharp and jagged. Now? The captain feels herself falling into the comfortability of her girlfriend with so much ease that she questions if it was her that dulled those sharp edges. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio takes the captain’s keys and opens the apartment, taking her bag and leading her into the bathroom with a silent demand. </span><em><span>Relax</span></em><span>. From there, Rio takes over the rest of the apartment. By the time Agatha walks out of the bathroom with her silk robe on and wet hair cascading over her shoulders, the apartment is cleaned and the pitcher is cooking in the kitchen. Something heavenly by the smell of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio gives her a soft, toothy grin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was wondering when you would come out of there.” Rio teases, glancing at the clock to see an hour had passed. Agatha makes a small noise of surprise when she catches sight of the clock as well. Her body automatically drifts towards the other woman, wrapping her arms around Rio’s middle and resting her chin over her left shoulder to watch her cook. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hungry?” Rio asks gently, wanting to pry but knowing Agatha the past few months have taught her that patience is key. It is also one of Rio’s struggles. Which means she has made some loopholes, food and sex, the way to Agatha’s beautiful mind when she has it under lock and key. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A soft nod rocks into her shoulder, “Smells good.” Agatha mumbles hoarsely, pressing her lips to Rio’s skin where she can find it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Arroz con pollo</span></em><span>,” Rio says swiftly, her puerto rican accent coming out, turning her head slightly to place a kiss to her girlfriend’s forehead. Agatha hums excitedly, peering a little higher over her shoulder to get a good look at the chicken, rice and cheese sauce being plated. Her stomach rumbles hungrily and Rio laughs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Take a seat, Harkness,” Rio says sternly, jerking her head towards the breakfast bar where she begins sliding the plates over, “What do you want to drink?” Agatha releases the pitcher with a parting kiss to her neck and eagerly climbs onto one of the bar stools. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Vodka,” Agatha responds easily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio lets out a small chuckle, snagging the bottle of vodka from the cabinet, “That kind of day, huh?” Agatha sends her a half-hearted glare, a warning to avoid the topic, but Rio doesn’t really heed her warnings anymore. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me.” Rio insists, pouring vodka into a shot glass then sliding a glass of water beside it. Agatha takes the shot first and it may as well be water with how easily it slides into her throat, warmth filling her quickly.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda is being benched, her elbow- she shouldn’t be pitching.” Agatha says quickly, pushing the words out of her mouth before she can second guess herself. Rio’s eyebrows raise in surprise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh,” Rio whispers softly, knowing that conversation couldn’t have gone very well, least of all for Herb let alone Agatha, “Wait does that-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha finally lets a small smile curl across her lips, “You’re starting for the game tomorrow.” She confirms. Rio’s smile is wide and bright and Agatha feels herself drawing closer to her like a moth to a flame. She wants to be burned by Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s…” Rio trails off, a sudden uncertainty that is unlike the confident young woman glinting in her eyes, “That’s not how I was hoping to get a starting spot.” Is she excited? Sure, but Wanda being benched because of an injury isn’t what she wanted. She liked the challenge the Scarlet Witch brought to the table, as chaotic as she was, Rio never wished ill on the woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha chides softly, knowing her train of thought is starting to veer off the tracks, turns to face the other woman, “You earned that spot. Herb was going to give it to you before I told him about Wanda’s arm.” Agatha reached out to brush a lock of hair behind her ear. Rio feels the weight in her chest lighten at her words. She takes a small breath with a happy smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’re going to kick ass tomorrow,” Rio husks, her small smile now shining bright and big. Agatha smiles back and tugs the pitcher forward to meet her lips in a chaste kiss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hell yeah we are.” Agatha agrees wholeheartedly. One more kiss connects their lips before they part. Agatha moans with her first bite of food. </span><em><span>Fucking amazing</span></em><span>. They force themselves to have an early night in preparation for the game tomorrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The locker room is buzzing with anticipation and excitement as soon as all of the women are together. Not even Wanda with her sour mood and glaring eyes can bring them down. The game starts in twenty minutes and the women are seconds from leaving the locker room to take to the field when Sharon walks in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, ladies, let’s get out there!” Sharon’s voice sounds unnaturally strained and fake, earning a few curious looks from the women but nonetheless, they start to file out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, one second,” Sharon whispers softly, reaching out to keep the young woman back. Agatha passes them with a concerned glance before she realizes it must be about the starting position. Well, that thought flies out the window when she exits the locker room to see Herb talking with two Westview police officers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s going on?” Agatha demands, as the two officers set off towards the locker room. Herb looks like he's about to blow an artery. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Campus police got an anonymous tip about marajuana in Vidal’s locker.” Herb mutters softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Agatha asks loudly, drawing attention from the other players. She is already making her way towards the locker room with Herb following closely behind her. “Rio would never jeopardize her career just to get high, Herb. You know that.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you know that the police have to check regardless. If it's not true then she has nothing to worry about.” Herb retorts quickly, a hopeful lilt in his voice. He does not need his star pitcher to get booked for drug charges on top of Wanda’s drama. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha and Herb step into the locker room to see the officers looking through Rio's locker and bags. The pitcher stands off to the side with Sharon, arms crossed and eyes glaring daggers into the two men conducting the search. Agatha catches her eye and Rio sends her a helpless, frustrated look filled with utter confusion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Got it,” One of the officers pulls out a bag of marijuana, holding it up in the air to show to the surrounding audience.  Rio's jaw drops and her eyes go wide.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus Christ," Herb groans softly in disappointment, rubbing the tension and strain from his eyes, and hoping for a different image. Agatha utters a soft curse of disbelief.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That's not mine!” Rio protests but the officers aren't buying it. Agatha feels shock swirling in her gut. There is no way Rio has been smoking or selling weed without Agatha knowing - or </span><em><span>suspecting</span></em><span> at the very least.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Botany major, right?” The officer holds up a botany text book from Rio's book bag, “</span><em><span>Figures</span></em><span>. We'll need to search your dorm and any other personal items you have. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was dealing.” His smug face burns a hole right through Rio's chest.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The fuck you will. It's not my weed - anyone has access to these lockers.” Rio hisses pointedly, one of the officers taking a stubborn stance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Except it's </span><em><span>your</span></em><span> locker.” The officer rebuttals smoothly, pointedly, like he </span><em><span>knows</span></em><span> Rio is guilty.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look around, there aren’t any fucking locks. It's not </span><em><span>mine</span></em><span>. Someone planted that on me.” Rio insists, heart beating out of her chest and sending her Coach a desperate glance. </span><em><span>It’s not hers</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And why would someone do that?” The officer laughs, smiling like he's amused by her struggling to prove her innocence. It rubs Agatha the wrong way. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't know. Maybe do your job and find out.” Rio spits venomously, frustration building hotly in her chest and curling around her lungs with attitude. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Watch yourself, young lady.” The officer steps closer, the smug smile having dropped to be replaced with a disgusted glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She's right - anyone has access to these lockers. You need more evidence than that,” Agatha says strongly, pinning the man with a stern glare. Rio feels an inkling of relief with her girlfriend’s words. They are quickly wiped away by the officer refusing to look away, meeting her angered gaze with one of his own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The other officer steps in, sufficiently pleased with their search, “Either way, the anonymous tip specifically called out Miss Vidal’s locker and the suspected evidence was found in there. She has to come to the station with us.” He steps forward, reaching for Rio’s arm but the pitcher twists away before he can grab her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t fucking touch me,” Rio growls, glaring daggers at the man who continues to come closer. Agatha steps forward, ready to step in, but she steps back just as quickly when Herb pulls her on her jersey, stepping between Rio and the officers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hold on, Officers, we have a game starting soon. Our pitcher-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does it look like we care?” The smug officer questions, narrowing his glare on the head Coach. Herb takes a breath, calming himself and forcing a smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Miss Vidal is an impeccable student and skilled athlete. She has a lot to lose if this were hers so I assure you, it is not. I can vouch for her.” Herb says passionately, urging the men to understand the situation. Rio doesn’t hold her breath.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not how this works, Herb.” The calmer of the two officers whispers softly, almost sounding empathetic, “She’s coming down to the station whether it’s voluntary or in handcuffs.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>,” Rio mutters under her breath, glancing at Agatha but quickly diverting her eyes, feeling the intensity of them too overwhelming. Herb pauses, looking over the other officer who begins reaching for his handcuffs, raising his hand to stop him. Herb turns around to look at Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach, you know-” Rio whispers hopefully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know,” Herb reassures his pitcher quickly, knowing very well how hard Rio has worked to keep her scholarship and grades, but shakes his head, “You have to go Vidal. It’s not yours, right?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right, but-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb stops her, “Then you’ll be okay. I’ll make sure of it. Just, please, go quietly.” Rio clenches her jaw, fists clenching with anger at her sides as everything in her body begs her to fight. Nonetheless, she doesn’t spare any of them a single glance as she stalks from the locker room, officers following close behind. Agatha is at a loss for words, stuck between shock and disbelief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'm going to meet her at the station,” Herb says quickly when he turns back to Sharon, handing over his clipboard.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I'll come with you.” Agatha says quickly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, you will play the game. Listen to Sharon. I will keep both of you updated.” Herb says swiftly, walking out of the locker room with the two women following closely.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach, I can help. The Harkness name alone can get Rio out-” Agatha desperately tries to step in but Herb won't stand for it, stopping a few feet from the dugout. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, we play this by the book. It will only look worse for her if it looks like someone is being paid off or tampering with the investigation.” Herb says strongly, Agatha groans in frustration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I need to help.” Agatha whispers tightly, fists clenching at her sides. She feels the rest of the team watching them. Murmurs of rumor and speculation floating faintly through the air after the pitcher was led from the field by cops. Herb sighs, realizing very quickly that he can't win this.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you get her a lawyer?” He questions softly, Agatha nodding her head quickly. “Make the call then get your head in the game. Got it?” Herb says sternly. Agatha is already pulling out her phone and walking away from her coaches to make the call. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stark &amp; Associates. This is Pepper, how can I help you?” The woman answers politely. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Pepper, it's Agatha Harkness. I need Tony at the Westview PD as soon as possible.” Agatha begins pacing, brow furrowed with worry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Miss Harkness. Can you give me any more details about your situation?” Pepper asks calmly, the loud click and clacks from the keyboard on the other end of the call echoing in her ear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not me, my gir- a friend.” Agatha bites her lips at the near slip. This can't get back to her mother. None of this. It's possible. Tony has gotten her out of plenty of situations without her mother knowing. That doesn't mean she shouldn't be careful. Evanora Harkness has eyes and ears everywhere. The typing on the other end of the call comes to a telling halt.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I see,” Pepper utters softly, hopefully deleting any evidence of the call as she speaks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio Vidal. An anonymous tip was placed that she had weed in her locker. It's not hers, but they found some. She has to get out of it.” Agatha sounds desperate, she knows this, and fortunately Pepper doesn't bring attention to it. A long pause fills the call.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let me transfer you to Mr.Stark.” Pepper mutes her line and Agatha releases a pent up sigh filled with anxiety. She forces the emotions in her throat down deep into her stomach, refusing to let them show. She glances towards the dugout to see Sharon urging the girls to get back on track. They are up to bat first, Jen sending her captain a curious glance as she walks to home plate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness, million dollar energy heiress and royal pain in my ass, it's been a while hasn't it.” Tony greets smugly, a clear smirk shining through his words. Agatha sighs heavily and rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The early years of her college days were quite frankly feral compared to the life she lives now. The lack of supervision from her mother led her to act out and get into trouble - </span><em><span>a lot</span></em><span> - making Tony Stark her emergency call in the middle of the night more than once. Thankfully, if paid enough, he keeps his mouth shut and Agatha continues to live her life without her Mother watching her every move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah - listen, I need you to get to the Westview Police Department.” Agatha says quickly, straight to the point. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And what am I walking into when I get there? Another drunk and disorderly?” Tony jabs, shuffling over the phone indicating he is already on the move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Agatha hisses, annoyed that he knows so much about her past. Tony Stark is a fantastic lawyer, best of the best in any case he takes on, exactly why he is on the Harkness Family payroll, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a cocky, arrogant son of a bitch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A friend - accused of smoking and dealing marajuana.” Agatha clears her throat, a bad taste in her mouth after using the word ‘</span><em><span>friend</span></em><span>’ to describe Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look at you switching up the charges </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> the accused.” Tony taunts easily, a car starting in the background, “You keep me on my toes Agatha - I like it.” She huffs out a frustrated breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Tony</span></em><span>,” Agatha’s voice sounds as threatening as she intends. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Name?” Tony asks quickly, speeding through Boston traffic with Westview programmed into his GPS. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio Vidal.” Agatha answers quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio Vidal</span></em><span>, why does that sound familiar?” The man questions but Agatha doesn’t have an answer for him, more concerned about her girlfriend probably talking herself into more charges at the police station. “Was it hers?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha scoffs, “No, of course not. Someone planted it in her locker and gave the police an anonymous tip.” She explains quickly, slightly offended Tony would ask such a thing, even if it is entirely reasonable to assume from a stranger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, that sounds like it was hers.” Tony responds bluntly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not.” Agatha answers strongly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure?” Tony questions in disbelief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sighs heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose to stop the headache from forming. It’s not working. “</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How well do you know this girl? Are you sure she’s just a friend? Is she your dealer?” Tony is relentless and knows exactly how to push Agatha’s buttons. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know her very well - she is a </span><em><span>friend</span></em><span>. Not a dealer.” She hisses angrily, the word </span><em><span>friend</span></em><span> tastes bitter now. The silence from the other side of the line lets the boiling rage inside of her die down to a simmer. A soft noise of almost impressed surprise sounds from the attorney. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmm,” Tony muses in thought. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hmm</span></em><span>,” Agatha mocks quickly, “What do you mean ‘</span><em><span>Hmm’</span></em><span>?” She whispers into the phone, only barely registering Sharon’s wildly expressive hand signals in her peripheral. </span><em><span>Shit, she’s up to bat</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing. You just keep me on my toes.” Tony sounds far too smug and knowing for a man who has known about their situation for less than five minutes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up,” Agatha hisses, making her way back to the dug out.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know, no other clients talk to me like this.” Tony responds indignantly, feigning annoyance. Agatha rolls her eyes, snagging her helmet off the rack by her bag, pinning anyone who sends her a questioning glance with a harsh glare.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They don’t pay you as much as I do.” Agatha bites back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Tony responds with an amused, bellied laugh before responding, “Touche. I’ll be there in ten.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha grabs her bat next, leaning it against the fenced dugout and feeling a little better about the situation. Then she catches Wanda’s cold, smug eyes and feels her gut twist with bitterness. She turns away, ignoring the protesting groans and shouts from the other team urging her toward the batter’s box. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good…take care of her.” Agatha whispers softly, emotions getting the better of her and cracking in her throat so she clears it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness, showing empathy. What an interesting turn of events.” Agatha could kill him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Shut up, Tony</span></em><span>.” Agatha growls, ending the call and tossing her phone into the vague direction of her bag. When she steps up to the plate and drops into her stance, the strike she gets doesn’t seem as important as Rio. Unfortunately, the whole team feels off without their pitcher and the only one able to make a decent play or hit is Wanda. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who are you?” Rio asks in disinterest, looking down at her nails after a quick glance up at the confident man in the very fancy suit. He looks entirely out of place under the fluorescent lighting and cinder block walls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I usually take care of billion dollar tech patent disputes and getting energy heiresses out of drunk and disorderly charges but today - I’m getting </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> out of here.” Tony tosses his briefcase onto the table and pulls out the chair across from Rio with a bone shaking scrape of metal on concrete. He turns his nose up at the sound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio narrows her eyes, “You’re not a prosecutor?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A </span><em><span>prosecutor</span></em><span>? Are you joking? Those people make pennies compared to me.” Tony looks genuinely offended, leaning back in his seat with his arms crossed, studying the woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay, so…” Rio trails off, looking for an answer to who in the hell this man is. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, right. I’m your savior, hero, guardian angel, liberator - I could go on but you’re really not in a situation to turn away a </span><em><span>sensational</span></em><span> defense attorney.” Tony smiles widely, happy to show off in any way shape or form. Rio’s jaw nearly drops at the cocky, confident attitude. Her eyebrows raise in shock anyhow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t know my situation and I didn’t call you.” Rio responds stubbornly. She crosses her arms, matching the man's stance and his eyes with defiance. Tony smirks, realizing that only  Agatha Harkness can find a woman with a harder head than her own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, Agatha Harkness did. She tells me that you know each other </span><em><span>very well</span></em><span>.” The knowing, amused look in his eyes only makes brown eyes narrow dangerously and lips to become tightly pressed together. Tony sighs, popping the button on his suit jacket and leaning forward, folding his hands on the table in front of him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Listen, Agatha is a client and now so are you.” Tony explains quickly, fixing the young woman with a pointed look, “So, the cops found out about your </span><em><span>recreational gardening</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They found weed in a locker that anyone has access to.” Rio points out snarkily, slouching further into the wildly uncomfortable metal chair and pinning the man with an unimpressed look.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right and you told them, ‘it’s not mine’, and they </span><em><span>totally</span></em><span> believed you.” Tony responds easily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They basically let me walk right out.” Rio replies sarcastically, widening her eyes in feigned excitement for dramatic effect and lets a smirk cross her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sarcasm. I see why Agatha likes you.” Tony taunts. Rio’s eyes darken at the mention of the brunette. “And you dabble in the </span><em><span>Devil’s lettuce</span></em><span>? What’s not to like?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenches, fighting off the urge to snap at the man about anything referencing Agatha. She’ll have to ask the brunette about him when she gets out. They seem to know each other too well. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not mine.” Rio feels like those words are starting to lose their meaning. Tony leans back in his chair with a sigh that borders on utter boredom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look, I can get you out of this - that’s easy.” He admits, tapping his fingers on the metal table in thought. “Dealing with the school will be a trickier task. They have rules that can be shaped to what fits the situation.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you get me out of </span><em><span>here</span></em><span>?” Rio asks pointedly, hopeful despite being thoroughly annoyed and pissed off. She can deal with the school later. Tony rolls his eyes and shakes his head as if the question is a high offense. He pulls out his phone as he stands with an exasperated huff of breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sit tight. I’ve got some officers to ruin and evidence to discredit. You’ll be out before supper.” Tony calls out over his shoulder as he leaves the interrogation room. True to his word, Tony gets Rio out of that interrogation room in a record time of two and a half hours. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When Rio steps into the police department lobby, she sees Herb and Tony waiting for her. No Agatha, but she tries to ignore how badly that stings. A Harkness has a reputation to uphold. It’s bad enough she used the family lawyer to get Rio out of deep shit. At least that’s what she has figured out in the last two and a half hours of her own mind to keep her company. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Out before supper.” Tony says proudly. Rio rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How are you doing?” Herb asks quickly, only receiving a shrug in return. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The charges are dropped, but you have enemies.” Tony sighs and pins her with an exhaustive look, “Whoever you pissed off managed to get the Westview University disciplinary board involved.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What does that mean for her?” Herb asks quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It means Rio is under investigation for possession of an illegal substance on school grounds.” Tony explains as gently as he is able. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But the charges were dropped.” Rio says in confusion, crossing her arms as dread fills her gut. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you the school has rules that have a lot more give than the police. They are conducting an investigation regardless of lack of evidence. Starting tonight, you are suspended from classes and all school affiliated activities.” Tony actually looks pained when he explains what this </span><em><span>investigation</span></em><span> means. Rio feels her heart drop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What about my scholarship?” She whispers softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Also suspended.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Am I even allowed back in my dorm?” Rio grits out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Until they decide you aren’t.” Tony sighs, glancing at his watch and picking up his brief case. “I’ll look into it - see what I can find out. Until then, stay out of trouble.” The lawyer leaves without a second glance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels the rage boiling her alive from the inside out. Herb drives her back to her dorm, informing her of the team’s loss on the way, and trying to tell her how important it is for her not to be doing drugs. She doesn’t even bother uttering the words ‘</span><em><span>It’s not mine</span></em><span>’. Rio doesn’t think this could get worse. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio spots Agatha’s wild mane of hair halfway down the hall before the other woman even sees her. It makes her steps stutter in surprise. She stops a foot away from the captain currently leaning against the door to her dorm, eyes closed and muscles tense. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey.” Rio greets softly, trying not to startle her and failing miserably. Agatha’s head shoots off the door and she swiftly stands up straight to look at the sudden approach. She sighs softly when she only sees Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha mutters back, relief filling her chest at the sight of her girlfriend. She doesn’t bother looking down the hallway or wondering if a set of eyes are on them, reaching for the raven haired woman and being met halfway. A gentle hand wraps around Agatha’s wrist and tugs her close, dropping her hand in favor of wrapping around her shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They both melt into each other with a sigh. Rio buries her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck and inhales deeply, immersing herself in the lavender and patchouli scent, tightening her embrace. Agatha returns with a strong squeeze of her own and tucks her chin to nose at the graceful hollow in the pitcher’s throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It-” Rio makes an effort to dissuade any false statements.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It wasn’t yours.” Agatha says strongly, pulling back just enough to look into pained brown eyes. “I know.” She uttered sincerely, hating that those expressive eyes look so surprised by her understanding. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A door opening down the hall pulls them apart. Rio steps forward with her key and pushes inside with Agatha following her in. Relief fills her when she notices nothing is out of place. The officers didn’t come raid her dorm like they said they would. Tony made sure of that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you for sending a lawyer. I don’t know how long I would’ve been stuck there without him.” Rio tosses her bag of gear onto the floor and leans back against the desk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course,” Agatha says quickly, as if it were completely normal to bail her secret girlfriend out of jail. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s a piece of work.” Rio reaches back to tug her hair out of the ponytail it has been in all day. Her hair flows freely down to her shoulders and a deft hand shakes the strands to release the tension in her skull. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha scoffs, “That is an understatement.” Rio barely manages a smile. She untucks the jersey from her pants and loosens the belt at her hips before she notices the brunette standing very awkwardly in the middle of the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don't have to stay.” Rio utters quietly, surprising Agatha, blue eyes finding the other woman with curiosity, “You've done more than anyone else has ever done for me but it puts you in the middle of this. I don't want your name getting dragged through the mud.” Rio states strongly, unbuttoning her jersey to reveal Agatha’s white tank top she undoubtedly ‘borrowed’ from her dresser. She runs her hand through her hair nervously, a pit in her stomach growing the size of Texas at the thought of Agatha being drawn into her problems. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hesitates, not because of the situation, but because Rio cares for her at her own expense and she worries that is the pitcher's first instinct. She moves closer, slowly, connecting their eyes and placing her hands on strong hips. Rio is level with Agatha’s own height when she is leaning against the desk like she is. Her legs spread to accommodate the brunette stepping closer but she keeps her fingers tightly curled around the ledge of the desk instead of landing on strong hips like she would prefer. A part of her knows that keeping her distance will help her later on if Agatha does decide to leave. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought the charges were dropped?” Agatha furrows her brow in confusion. She didn’t get the entire scoop from Herb, only barely managing to get the tiniest information from the coach when she leveraged her position as captain to ‘be in the know’. She knows she should’ve called Tony but listening to him blather on with that cocky attitude of his did not sound appealing after the day she’s had. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio shifts uncomfortably under her gaze. “The school disciplinary board is starting an investigation,” Rio informs her, taking the hands off of her hips, “I’m suspended until they come to a decision. No classes, no softball…no scholarship.” She releases her hands and pushes off of the desk, putting space between them as she pulls off her jersey to toss aside. The gentle rejection feels more like a slap in the face. Agatha turns to watch the raven haired woman shuck the uniform from her body. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They can’t do that. They don’t have any evidence to support your suspension.” Agatha rebuttals. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tony said the school has the ability to shape the rules how they see fit.” Rio pushes out of her uniform pants and distracts herself by grabbing fresh clothes, “And what they see fit is to kick me out of this school because of someone else's agenda.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Someone else's agenda?” Agatha is struggling to catch up, grabbing Rio’s wrist and spinning her around to face her. “Rio, I don’t understand.” The raven haired woman finally meets her eyes again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I made an enemy - a big one, apparently, because they have enough persuasion in the university to put me under investigation for a crime I didn’t commit.” Rio explains quickly, hoping the anxiety of it all will leave her along with the words. It doesn’t work. Agatha’s brow furrows in confusion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can fight it.” Agatha says sternly, trying to think, trying to convince the other woman. Rio sighs and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fight it? Agatha, I am an Eastview Community College transfer, banking off of a scholarship, living off of money I make on shitty service jobs. I can’t fight this.” Rio pulls on a pair of dark jeans and a t-shirt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can help you fight it.” Agatha hisses angrily, frustration bubbling so strongly inside of her it is starting to boil over in the form of rage. Rio scoffs, shoving handfuls of clothes into a duffle bag. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you, I don’t want your name dragged through the mud. You have a future to protect.” Rio won’t allow it, won’t accept the help. It drives Agatha mad because for once, her cold, icy paperweight of a heart is desperate to protect the one person she has gotten so close to and she is </span><em><span>refusing</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, what?” Agatha grabs the duffle from her hands and tosses it towards the far side of the bed. Rio looks at her in shock, the sudden move and outburst of anger taking her by surprise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re going to just lay down and take it?” Agatha hisses, pushing forward into her space. Rio takes a step back only for Agatha to take another step forward. Her ass hits the edge of the bed and her hands come to stable herself on the frame digging into her lower back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re smart - so smart I find myself studying twice as hard just to stay ahead of you,” Agatha admits with an annoyed roll of her eyes when perfectly sculpted eyebrows shoot up in surprise.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you can </span><em><span>pitch</span></em><span>, better than anyone I’ve ever seen.” She gushes passionately, hoping to get her point across, feeling the air shift when she notices the cold, dissociated look in Rio’s eyes warming up. Sure enough, Rio feels the defeated part of her fading away with every word, replaced with a stubborn defiance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s next words sound softer, “And I like you - a lot - </span><em><span>so much more</span></em><span> than I ever thought I would.” </span><em><span>Ugh, feelings</span></em><span>. The corners of Rio’s lips twitch just slightly, eluding to the shit eating grin she is struggling to hold back. The same grin Agatha hates to love but loves to see. She rolls her eyes, pressing forward to press her body against the other woman and drag her hands up to cup her cheeks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I hope you were listening because I will never admit it again.” Agatha groans softly when the other woman’s grin spreads across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you repeat that? I would love to get a recording-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha kisses Rio to shut her up.</span></p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>It’s been a week since Rio got suspended. A week since she started living with Agatha because the school taped off her dorm for the investigation. She insisted she could live with her abuelita across town, visit when she could, because moving in was definitely too soon for the new couple. Agatha, in a perfectly Agatha roundabout way, eventually made the point that Rio nearly lived at the apartment even when she did have her own dorm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As much as Rio loves it, twenty four seven access to Agatha, but staying in the studio apartment is driving her insane. A woman can only cook and clean and fuck so much. Not that Agatha minds - sort of.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>After her fourth orgasm of the early morning Agatha is spent, “I-I can’t.” She pushes Rio’s head from between her thighs and squeezes them closed, whining slightly at the inadvertent friction against her heated cunt. Rio takes a few deep breaths, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand and smirking down at the brunette from where she sits back on her heels. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness is tapping out?” Rio sends her a mocking pout. Agatha huffs in disbelief of this woman’s stamina and insatiable appetite. This is the second early morning of the week where Rio’s energized brain has woken up and thought of naughty ways to force Agatha into an early morning as well. Yesterday consisted of sweet words and light touches. This morning, Agatha woke up with Rio's head between her thighs and an orgasm zipping down her spine. She shook her head, uncertain if she could survive another morning like this.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you make me come again - my </span><em><span>fifth</span></em><span> orgasm, by the way - I might just have a stroke.” Agatha points out, eyes still closed and muscles twitching with overexertion. Screaming of soreness and begging for a reprieve. Even still, Rio’s answering dark, humorous chuckle makes her cunt flutter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine, I’ll give you a break.” Rio sighs dramatically and falls into the bed beside the brunette. Agatha chuckles and shakes her head once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think you need a hobby.” The captain turns to limply drape herself across her significant other. Rio grunts in disinterest, face scrunched up at the thought while her fingers draw nonsensical patterns into soft, sweat slicked skin of her girlfriend’s trembling thigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are my hobby.” Rio insists, smiling at the real, bellied laugh that the other woman breathes out against her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ll break me before you get your fill, sweetheart.” Agatha pushes herself up to an elbow, filtering her fingers through silky hair as she looks down at the woman. Rio rolls her eyes even though she knows the other woman is right. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I clean. I cook. I do things other than fuck you.” Rio tries to reason but one pointed look from the brunette lets her know that isn’t sufficient, she knows that. “So, I need a hobby.” Rio sighs, thinking of all the things she used to fill her time before the suspension. Softball, school, and gardening. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was thinking, I could lecture you. Fill you in on the classes you’ve missed.” Agatha offers, scratching slightly at the woman’s scalp. Rio hums slightly in feigned intrigue, debating the point of continuing her education if the committee decides to screw her over, dread seeping into her at the thought of never attending classes again. She’s not holding her breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Or</span></em><span> I could fuck you again?” Rio rebuttals, earning a half-hearted glare from the brunette. She sighs and stares up at the ceiling. “What is the point if they decide to expel me?” She wonders aloud. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We would find you a new university to attend.” Agatha says strongly, refusing to let Rio succumb to anything less than she deserves because of someone else's agenda. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know I can’t leave my abuelita.” Rio says softly, turning her eyes to the catcher. Agatha frowns softly, knowing very well that Rio already feels guilty for leaving her grandma in Eastview. It isn’t much more than a thirty minute bus ride, fifteen if Agatha is driving, but that doesn’t make it easier. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll figure it out </span><em><span>if</span></em><span> we have to. Nothing is set in stone yet.” Agatha reminds her, rubbing the tension from dark eyebrows furrowing into a frown. Rio tries to relax, sending a quick glance over Agatha’s shoulder to the alarm clock on her nightstand, and the tension refuses to leave her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve gotta get going. Your first class starts in forty five minutes.” Rio mutters. Agatha twists far enough to see her alarm clock and confirms that her girlfriend is right. She turns back around and tugs the woman forward for a quick kiss before sliding out of bed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you </span><em><span>behave</span></em><span>, you can shower with me.” Agatha says over her shoulder, struggling to walk on shaking legs towards the bathroom. She smiles when Rio’s quick feet patter across the wooden floor with excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha runs through the motions of her classes. They seem to drag on longer than she likes these days without a certain annoying raven haired woman beside her. She dislikes leaving Rio at the apartment by herself more and more. The real difficulty is leaving for the softball game she knows Rio can’t even attend. Nonetheless, she sends Agatha off with a kiss and does her best not to look heart broken. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How is Rio holding up?” Jen asks curiously, stretching in the grass across from the captain. Agatha thinks about snapping at the woman for even asking before remembering Rio means a lot to the other women. They have a right to be concerned. They’ve lost two games without Rio as their relief pitcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s…She’s trying to stay busy. Trying not to think about the investigation.” Agatha says slowly, refusing to let heat bloom across her chest at the thought of how the pitcher is staying busy. The women still don’t know about that. They only know that Agatha has found a sliver of compassion in her cold, wicked heart to allow the former pitcher to couch surf while her dorm is off limits.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure she’ll find something to keep her preoccupied.” Alice says thoughtfully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Or </span><em><span>someone</span></em><span>,” Jen whispers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolls her eyes with an indignant huff, “Cut it out, Jen.” A quick glare has Jen’s hands raising in mock surrender but that curious glint in her eyes never fails to get under the brunette’s skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio is annoyingly stubborn and arrogant. I’m sure she’ll survive.” Wanda jumps in, dismissive and grumbling with disdain. Agatha doesn’t have the energy to send her even a glare in reprimand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t remember talking to </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>.” Agatha bites back harshly, pushing up from the ground and walking back to the dugout to get her gear on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pops up the hood of her jacket and slides into the back row of the bleachers. She is </span><em><span>bored</span></em><span>, like ‘I would rather get in trouble than stare at the ceiling’ type of boredom. So, she sneaks into the softball game, no one from the disciplinary board would even think of attending, and keeps to herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio makes it through half of the game before a certain head coach spots her. “Fuck.” She grumbles, dipping her head as Herb hands the reins over to Sharon and makes his way to the bleachers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re not supposed to be here.” Herb says softly, casually leaning against the metal with crossed arms while looking out at the game. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I’m not.” Rio says quickly, earning a disapproving shake of his head, “Come on Coach. I’m dying of boredom. I’m gone as soon as the game is over.” She even puts on a desperate little pout to her lips for show. Herb doesn’t buy into the act but he leaves her be. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The game ends with the Westview Witches on top by only one point of difference. Even with the win, the locker room is quiet and filled with tension. Only Wanda seems truly pleased with their victory. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know what this means, right?” Wanda asks Monica, throwing her arm across her shoulders and tugging her close with a bright smile, “Championships! We’re going to the championships against the Salem Seven.” Monica shrugs the arm off of her shoulders and rolls her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, Wanda, we get it.” Monica sighs and shrugs her bag onto her shoulders instead. The redhead bristles at the blunt rejection, her bright eyes quickly flashing with rejection and her smile falling into a tight press of lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell is wrong with all of you?” Wanda hisses loudly, gathering everyone's attention with ease. Agatha, used to the outbursts by now, busies herself with gathering her things. “We </span><em><span>won</span></em><span>. Would it kill you to celebrate?” Wanda slams her locker open, a few of the women leaving before they have to worry about it getting any farther. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It doesn’t feel the same without Rio.” Dottie says quietly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda groans and rolls her eyes, “How are all of you so hung up on that bitch?” It’s a rhetorical question, no one answers, but that doesn’t stop the redhead from continuing her spew of hate. “She’s gone and we’re better for it - you should be thanking me.” It's a mumble, barely a whisper, but Agatha hears it. They all hear it and they all freeze.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Suddenly, everything makes sense. The weed, the police targeting Rio’s locker, the school disciplinary board getting involved. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda is Rio’s enemy - always has been. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everyone. Out.” Agatha whispers lowly, slamming her locker closed as she spins on the redhead. The women hesitate, caught between curiosity and fear. Jen, in particular, is watching the two women with a careful eye, solving the mystery between the sudden aggression. When no one moves Agatha sends them all a deadly glare. “</span><em><span>Out</span></em><span>.” She growls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s go - you heard your captain.” Jen urges the rest of the women out of the locker room. She is the last one out, sending Agatha a knowing look as she leaves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>So, Rio lied. “Is Agatha still in there?” She asks when she spots Jen walking warily out of the locker room. The first baseman narrows her eyes on the rookie with a suspicious little smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Aren’t you banned from school grounds or something?” Jen asks. Rio rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you going to turn me in, Kale?” She jabs curiously, already knowing the answer when the other woman scoffs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Back in the locker room, the catcher moves forward toward the pitcher standing stubbornly in place when blazing blue eyes settle on her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did you say?” Agatha whispers, stopping only a foot away from the other woman, “</span><em><span>We should be thanking you</span></em><span>.” The words come out mockingly. Wanda recognizes her mistake by now, swallowing the panic in her throat but ultimately standing strong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You should. Rio was the death of this team.” Wanda responds calmly, just barely managing to keep the tremble out of her voice. Agatha lets out a short laugh, a dark glint in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio saved this team before you got your way - like you always do.” Agatha husks darkly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If I had my way, that bitch would be rotting in a jail cell.” Wanda hisses venomously, hot red rage boiling in her gut and shining in her eyes. The Scarlet Witch coming out to play. Agatha isn’t afraid. Knowledge is power and she has all of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was Pietro’s wasn’t it?” Agatha prodds, a knowing grin spreading across her lips when green eyes darken at the mention of her beloved brother. “It would be a shame if he got dragged into this. Thrown to the mercy of the disciplinary board for the </span><em><span>third</span></em><span> time. Not even your parents could save him from your mess.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels revenge and retribution clawing up her spine to take front row in dismantling Wanda’s perfect act. She sees her crumbling. A twitch of a clenched jaw muscle </span><em><span>there</span></em><span>, a fiery glare </span><em><span>here</span></em><span> - and </span><em><span>tada!</span></em><span> The Scarlet Witch is already reaching her breaking point. It helps that Agatha knows all of her weaknesses - every single button - and she is desperate to press them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Though they had a hand in it too, didn’t they? Calling in a few favors from the board - taking Rio’s scholarship away, her spot on the team, her place in the dorms. A true family affair, huh?” Agatha presses closer, forcing Wanda to look up at her to keep eye contact. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me - what was it that finally sent you over the edge?” Agatha wonders. Wanda opens her mouth, failing to produce a single word before clearing her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She stole you-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Bullshit</span></em><span>,” Agatha cuts off sharply, angrier now, because Wanda tried to lie. As if it would help her. “Tell the truth. What finally broke The Scarlet Witch’s back?” She goades and probes and presses all the buttons she can reach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda Maximoff breaks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That bitch stole my fucking spot!” Wanda growls, hands flying up to throw Agatha back into the lockers. Her body hits with a loud thud and clanging of metal doors. Wanda moves forward, eyes blazing red and fingers twitching with the need to control </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> - </span><em><span>anything</span></em><span>. Maybe </span><em><span>strangle someone</span></em><span>. That thought is very appealing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen stops mid sentence when she hears a loud bang from inside the locker room. “Stay here.” She says to Rio who stubbornly huffs at still not getting an answer to her question. The first baseman makes her way back towards the locker room door.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I worked my entire life to get here and Rio steals everything - ruins everything in a matter of months! Some </span><em><span>Eastview Community College</span></em><span> bitch was going to take my spot on the team.” She says the words like her tongue burns with each stroke, disgust palpable in her voice, that someone below her class would out play her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda’s hand reaches forward, rage and selfish instincts taking over her as she grips Agatha’s face. The brunette takes in a sharp breath, her hands coming to grip Wanda’s wrist in an attempt to pull her away but her nails only dig deeper into her jaw. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Over the redhead’s shoulder Agatha sees the locker room door open, Jen appearing in the dimly lit entrance with a face filled with utter shock. Agatha glances back at Wanda, only half relieved to see she didn’t notice her team mates entrance. As soon as she looks back at the door it is closing without the first baseman in sight, she feels her heart drop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha can hold her own against the Scarlet Witch - it just won’t be pretty. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen emerges from the locker room, “Don’t let anyone inside.” She whispers to the pitcher who stands up straight with alarm, glancing at the locker room with curiosity, while Jen takes off towards Herb and Sharon. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Poor Wanda Maximoff</span></em><span>,” Agatha drawls coldly, mockingly, wincing slightly at the woman’s tightening grip, “Do you expect me to feel sorry for you? A lower class of woman has more skills than you, so what? Get over it. You’re pathetic.” Wanda looks genuinely shocked by her words, angry facade faltering for a half a second before rearing with a vengeance. Agatha groans softly in pain when her head is thrust back into the metal locker with a bang, covering the sound of the door opening. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I expect you, of all people, to understand that I did what I had to do to stay on top.” Wanda growls, eyes wild and crazed. “I planted drugs on Rio to keep </span><em><span>my fucking spot</span></em><span> and I would do it again if it meant I was the only pitcher for this team.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Miss Maximoff,” Herb bellows sternly, the Scarlet Witch slinking back into Wanda Maximoff as quickly as she had appeared. Her hand flies from Agatha’s jaw as she spins toward her Head Coach. Mouth agape and struggling to claw back her perfect image. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Coach-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My office. </span><em><span>Now.</span></em><span>” Herb doesn’t leave room for discussion. Wanda turns her eyes to the ground and begins walking out of the locker room, Sharon and Herb hot on her tail. That’s when Agatha spots Jen, lingering by the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thought you left me to get my ass beat.” Agatha says bluntly, rubbing at the tender spot at the back of her head and working her tense jaw. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen scoffs, “You would’ve had her ass on the ground in two seconds.” Agatha smirks, catching her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah,” She mutters softly, grabbing her bag of gear and pulling it onto her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So…Wanda is kind of </span><em><span>psycho</span></em><span>.” Jen mutters as she holds the door open for the captain. Agatha can’t help the laugh that bursts from her chest. That might be the single most entertaining thing the first baseman has ever said.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the fuck?” Rio hisses angrily, utterly confused at the events unfolding before her. Wanda being perp walked by her coaches and Agatha coming out with a jaw red from someone’s hand, fingertip marks imprinted along the sharp bone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” Agatha hisses in a whisper when Rio walks up to her. The question is ignored, Rio’s hand gently cupping her cheeks and tilting her head to get every angle on the marks that will surely bruise. It is sweet how concerned she is but it is also intimate and </span><em><span>very </span></em><span>telling. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Much to Agatha’s embarrassment, Jen figures it out in two seconds </span><em><span>flat</span></em><span>, eyes widening in shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She put her hands on you.” Rio growls lowly, not a question but a statement, eyes flaring with anger as she turns her head to look back at the retreating form of Wanda Maximoff. </span><em><span>Rio could kill her</span></em><span>. Agatha places a calming hand on Rio’s wrist and squeezes gently before pulling her hand away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She admitted to everything,” Agatha diverts the focus from herself back to the situation at hand, “Wanda planted the drugs on you.” Rio’s eyes flicker with relief and understanding before landing right back on absolute rage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you fucking serious?” Rio hisses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry, I need some answers.” Jen interrupts swiftly, eyes lit with intrigue and sheer amusement as she observes the two women. Rio finally realizes they have an audience and moves her hands away from Agatha with a guilty look towards the brunette. The deadly glare in her eyes is tinted with a special glint but nonetheless, Rio will be in trouble later. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You two…you’re…” Jen flounders for the right word, gesturing vaguely between the two women as her smile slowly grows. Agatha rolls her eyes but caves because she is honestly shocked they made it this far without Jen’s nosy, gossiping self catching on to their secret when Rio has the complete opposite of a </span><em><span>discrete personality</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Dating</span></em><span>,” Agatha grits out. While she is proud to call Rio Vidal her girlfriend, this feels too much like loosing to Jennifer </span><em><span>fucking</span></em><span> Kale to be pleasant. Even still, the truth makes the pitcher smile and that alone makes Agatha feel more like a winner.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Until Jennifer Kale releases an honest to God </span><em><span>cackle</span></em><span> like the true witch she is.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, shove it up your ass Kale.” Agatha hisses. Rio lets out a huff of a laugh, earning a glare but smiling anyway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wow, I mean…</span><em><span>wow</span></em><span>.” Jen catches her breath and immediately delves for more information. “How long? I just assumed you both hated each other but then again I guess that made great foreplay.” She is actually impressed and honestly hates Agatha for one upping her because she did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> see this coming. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Wait</span></em><span>, those marks on Rio’s back - Agatha, that was you? And the hickies!” Jen is spiraling, linking one event to the next with so much ease it’s as if all the puzzle pieces are falling into place right in front of her eyes. Agatha groans loudly and pins the woman with a glare that all but guarantees destruction if the woman continues. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t say one more word, Kale.” She hisses lowly, stepping closer. Jen, despite having the undeniable urge to rile up her captain, still has an unbreakable respect for the woman. She bites her tongue for a second with a sigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen steps back from the other woman. “Don’t worry. I know how to keep a secret as much as I know how to spread one.” She walks away with a parting wink towards her team mates. Agatha can’t help but roll her eyes again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did she think that was supposed to make me feel better?” The brunette mumbles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She won’t say anything.” Rio says sincerely, instinctively reaching out to run a calming hand along her girlfriend’s lower back. Agatha sighs and turns back towards Rio, wanting nothing more than to fall into her arms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How do you know?” Agatha asks pointedly, raising an eyebrow. Rio moves her hand to take the hefty bag of gear off of the catcher’s shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just do.” The pitcher shrugs, a small grin gracing her lips as Agatha reluctantly begins following her back towards the parking lot. “What happens now?” Rio asks curiously as she tosses the bag into the back of the Bronco.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Now, we get your life back.” Agatha says confidently.</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha growls, a huffing angered breath leaving her lips as she tugs on the silk sash wrapped around her wrists and tied off to the bed frame. She cranes her neck to see that Rio has perfected the knots currently securing her wrists. The binds only tighten with each jerk of her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, </span><em><span>Ags</span></em><span>?” Rio calls out tauntingly from the closet. Agatha rolls her eyes, not even acknowledging the nickname. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you doing in there? You’ve been gone for twenty minutes.” Agatha complains as she squirms in her bindings. Her naked legs kick out across the cool sheets and her hips roll back against the mattress. Of course Rio leaves her tied to the bed in nothing more than her lacy purple underwear. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Turnabout is fair play, Harkness</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha remembers fucking the pitcher into the matress when she had her tied up, </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> making her wait thirty minutes to be touched. Her thighs squeeze together fondly at the memory. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio scoffs, “It’s been two minutes.” So, Agatha was being dramatic. Rio emerges from the closet where she has clearly raided the brunette’s sex toys. The toys in her arms shift precariously before placing them in a neat pile at the end of the bed. Agatha raises her head to investigate the said pile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did you grab?” Agatha wonders curiously, already spotting the purple wand vibrator sitting in the mix. Her tongue flicks out to wet her lips and her thighs squeeze together once more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, ah, ah,” Rio chides swiftly, reaching over to part strong thighs by grasping Agatha’s ankle, “Keep these open.” She keeps her hand on her ankle, waiting for the other leg to spread a little further before releasing her. Agatha’s hips roll in search of friction, enjoying the slight catch of lace dragging across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well?” Agatha prompts hopefully, spreading her legs wider and giving Rio a look that she hopes pushes the raven haired woman into touching her. The other woman smiles softly, appreciating the view for a second before focusing once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ll find out soon enough. Don’t worry.” Rio dismisses, moving to stand at the end of the bed, rolling up the sleeves of her white button down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She suffered through an entire university charity event serving food and drinks while Agatha bombarded her phone with filthy texts. She promised retribution and she plans on fulfilling that promise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t help herself, she’s been feeling a little neglected - not that she would admit that aloud. Ever since Wanda confessed to planting the weed on Rio the raven haired woman has been spending her time in conference calls and meetings trying to reinstate her scholarship. Luckily, once the school realized the Maximoff's manipulation of the disciplinary board, they didn't put up a fight against Rio returning to class and the softball team, even her dorm. Unfortunately, the state has a different set of requirements that include lengthy interviews. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When Rio isn't on conference calls she is busy catching up on class work and working any events she can to get some cash. Agatha had offered to cover her expenses but Rio turned her down in a heartbeat. Nonetheless, they've had limited time together and Agatha was getting a little desperate for attention. She took matters into her own hands and sent naughty, dirty texts to her girlfriend while she was working the charity event in the hopes of the pitcher returning to the apartment with a punishment in mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It worked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio looks like she is about to </span><em><span>ruin</span></em><span> her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha can’t wait. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve been neglecting you, haven’t I?” Rio husks, tilting her head slightly as she looks down at the brunette. Agatha smiles softly and nods her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m so neglected,” Agatha breathes out, biting into her bottom lip as her eyes rake down the woman’s body. Wanda was so wrong, Rio fucking </span><em><span>wears</span></em><span> these clothes. The white button down hugs her in all the right places, the sleeves now rolled up to expose her forearms, a few buttons popped open to tease her cleavage. The shirt is tucked into black slacks adorned with a black belt, fitting perfectly over her hips. Agatha almost didn’t let her leave for the event.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio smiles back, slowly walking over to the other side of the bed and dragging her fingertips up her ankle to the inside of her thigh but stopping before she reaches her pussy. Instead she tightens her grip to spread Agatha’s legs wider. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You poor thing,” Rio coos softly, leaning over the bed with a hand to steady herself on the mattress as her other continues the teasing trail of her fingertips over soft skin up her body. Agatha’s muscles jump and her hips tremble with the effort to stay still. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have a gift for you.” The woman teases the tip of her fingers around taut nipples. Agatha arches into the touch. “And a…</span><em><span>challenge</span></em><span>.” Her fingers move higher and higher until they are tracing the catcher’s soft lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh?” Agatha prompts curiously, parting her lips in the hope Rio will take the silent invitation. Rio licks her lips and resists the urge to lean down to take a nipple into her mouth. She leans back instead, a pout forming on the brunette’s lips at her retreat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t go anywhere,” Rio teases as she walks to her book bag near the couch. Agatha rolls her eyes and sighs loudly. It only makes Rio smile wider and take a second longer to grab what she needs. She comes back to the bed and holds up the new toy she bought the other day. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She’s had this plan in her mind for a while. Tying Agatha up and seeing how many times she can edge her with this toy was a recurring fantasy. The toy is curved into a “U” shape, one end of the toy wider than the other.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That looks interesting,” Agatha says softly, intrigued and sceptical. She’s certainly not opposed, especially because Rio looks so excited, but she hasn’t seen a toy like that before. Rio moves closer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s a remote controlled vibrator. I already connected it to the app.” Rio pulls out her phone and opens the app, turning the vibrator on and raising the power. The vibrator comes to life in her hand. Agatha’s eyes widen slightly, far more intrigued now, and her hips squirming in anticipation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This side goes inside of you,” Rio explains, pointing to the wider end, “and this rests on top of your clit.” She turns the vibrator off. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You control it?” Agatha asks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do. I want to see how many times I can edge you before you fall apart.” Rio places the toy on the bed and leans back over the bed, fulfilling her urges and sucking lightly on the brunette’s nipple. Agatha moans softly, arching into her mouth and fighting to keep her legs spread instead of squeezing them together. The prospect of being edged never intrigued her so much. It sounds frustrating but, </span><em><span>turnabout is fair play</span></em><span>, she supposes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha mutters, already nodding her head, going along with anything Rio plans as long as she keeps touching her. “Okay, yes.” She feels a small smile daring to creep onto her lips with that devilish smirk shines up at her. Rio’s right hand trails lower as she leans further to take her other nipple, teasing her fingers over the wet lace at the apex of strong thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans softly, “So wet already.” Agatha hates how that teasing tone sends a rush of heat down her spine. Rio slips her fingers inside her panties and moans louder at the wet heat that envelopes her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, baby, you are soaked.” Rio husks, leans up to connect their lips and swipe her tongue into her mouth. Agatha parts her lips with a moan, her hands instinctively trying to pull down to bring Rio closer only to be stopped. A frustrated groan leaves her but the fingers exploring her sex are an easy distraction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is in awe of the amount of wetness she finds, easily letting her fingers slip across her clit. Agatha’s hips roll and grind with the stimulation, moaning into the kiss with a soft whine. It has been too long. She’s not sure how long she will last in this little challenge of Rio’s but she'll still put up a good fight.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You feel so </span><em><span>good</span></em><span>,” Rio groans when their lips part, sliding one finger inside of her girlfriend and moaning again at the way her pussy clenches around her, “So tight.” She breathes out, pumping slowly despite the harsh rolls of hips meeting her finger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More.” Agatha whispers, moaning as an eager second finger stretches her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Greedy girl.” Rio teases, dropping her mouth back to her breasts. Agatha moans and bucks her hips harder, skilled fingers reaching that delicious spot inside of her. Her hands curl around the silk with white knuckles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, Rio.” Agatha moans, tossing her head back and bucking up to meet Rio’s thrusts. The pad of the pitcher’s thumb presses against her clit and suddenly she is careening toward climax. Her hips become sloppy and her moans a crescendo in the quiet room, only the sound of her wetness coating talented fingers to rival her sounds. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels the silky walls surrounding her fingers beginning to flutter. A wicked smile comes over her lips, pulling back from the brunette’s chest at the same time she removes her fingers. Agatha’s stuttering gasp and following groan of annoyance makes her smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha hisses ominously, hand jerking against her binds with the intent to force the woman back inside of her, with no luck. Her hands are still tied and she is throbbing, helpless. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, baby?” Rio asks sweetly, lips trailing over her chest before moving lower. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Make me come.” Agatha grunts, grinding her hips up into thin air with the command that doesn’t really land as one when she sounds so breathless. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mmm,” Rio hums in thought, teeth nipping at the sensitive skin on her hip with a smile, “No, I don’t think so.” She leans back to send the woman a smile. Agatha lets out a huff and gives her a half hearted glare, eagerly waiting for her next move. Rio reaches for the toy and moves Agatha’s leg to spread her open, moving her panties aside. It takes nearly nothing to press the toy inside, Agatha groaning happily at being filled again, squeezing around the toy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good?” Rio questions curiously, pulling her panties back into place over the toy. Agatha nods her head, watching Rio with hooded eyes as a moan slips past her lips. “Let me hear you. Tell me your safe word.” Rio requests gently, running her hand over her thigh and placing a kiss to the hip. Agatha stays stubbornly silent for a few seconds until she realizes Rio won’t move without voicing her safe word.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Wanda</span></em><span>,” Agatha grumbles, starting to become impatient and squirming under Rio’s dark eyes, “I’m good - feels so good.” She moans softly when Rio smirks and presses the toy deeper, the other end settling on top of her clit. Rio fishes her phone out of her pocket and swipes to open the app, turning the vibrator on low - for now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, fuck me.” Agatha moans deeply, her eyes slipping closed as the vibrations take over her thoughts. Pleasure racing down her spine and a whine leaving her lips. The feeling is on the edge of overwhelming, the vibrations landing perfectly against her clit and curling up inside of her, but it feels amazing. Rio reaches out, tugging at her thong to press the toy completely flush. Agatha takes the friction with a moan, bucking her hips for more before the woman lets go. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stands up from the bed and moves back to the end, watching as Agatha writhes in pleasure. She smirks and slowly raises the vibrations, the brunette gasping and arching her back. The orgasm Agatha was denied rushing back to the forefront of her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does that feel good baby?” Rio asks as she turns the vibrations up some more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha releases a guttural moan, “</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>.” It is deep and wanton, her cunt spasming around the soft silicone as she comes closer to the edge. Pleasure clouds her mind, chasing release and letting her moans fly free. Her hips buck back against the mattress, trying to work herself closer. Her orgasm is seconds from cresting over the edge. She certainly won’t be stopping to tell Rio that, too worried that she would stop again. Maybe she will let her come now. Once to the edge and back is good enough, right?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, ah, ah.” The vibrations lower, nearly turning off, and Agatha groans in frustration as she bucks her hips, “Legs open, baby.” Rio scolds, coming back around to the side of the bed to grip her thigh, keeping her in place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s a shame,” Rio husks as she leans down to suck Agatha’s right nipple into her mouth, drawing out a soft gasp, “You were doing so good.” Agatha whines softly, pathetically, but her half lidded eyes settle on the other woman with a harsher glare than before. Rio only smirks, placing her phone to the side of the bed, keeping the vibrator low, and turning her attention to the nipples practically begging for her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe I need more restraints?” Rio teases. Agatha moans at the thought of being completely at Rio’s mercy. She just knows she would be tortured to death then. But what a beautiful death it would be. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just fuck me.” She means for it to sound demanding. Instead, it sounds whiny and a little pitiful coming from her mouth but Agatha convinces herself it is the farthest thing from begging. Definitely. Rio fucking chuckles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ready for more?” Rio grabs her phone and pushes the dial higher, dragging a deep groan and soft curses from the brunette. She keeps the vibrations at half power while she settles further on the bed, peppering Agatha’s chest with kisses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, God, Rio. Just like that,” Agatha whispers, trying to appeal to the other woman's merciful nature - not that she has much of one - but there is a little section of her brain that loves to hear her. Rio moans against her chest, nipping at her skin and swirling her tongue around her nipples. Her other hand comes up to toy with her neglected nipple, squeezing and caressing her in the same method as she treats the other.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,</span><em><span> fuck</span></em><span>, thats it. Make me come, sweetheart,” Agatha breathes out, a commanding edge in her breathless tone. Rio groans softly with the pet name but stays strong, releasing her nipple with an audible pop and reaching blindly for her phone. She runs the vibrations high for all of three seconds, enjoying the way Agatha's back arches and her legs threaten to close, before dropping it again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The literal </span><em><span>growl</span></em><span> that sounds from the catcher is music to her ears. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You fucking </span><em><span>brat</span></em><span>,” Agatha hisses between labored breaths, her chest heaves as she settles after being brought to the edge. She tries to close her legs in search of more friction and defiantly rob the raven haired woman of her perfect view. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don't be like that, Ags.” Rio wastes no time reaching out and pulling her legs apart once more. She slides onto the bed, placing her body between tense thighs and smirking as the muscles under her palms tremble when she skates them over her thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then don’t be a tease, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>.” Agatha sneers, trying very hard to avoid acknowledging that stupid nickname </span><em><span>again</span></em><span>, a soft gasp leaving her lips when Rio shifts forward and pushes the toy harshly against her soaking cunt with her own pelvis. She moans and rolls her hips to meet the new friction. Her brow furrows at the way Rio watches her so expectantly, as if waiting for her to catch on to </span><em><span>something</span></em><span>. Some devious little plan, Agatha has no doubt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sure enough, when her hips roll again, a louder and deeper groan leaves her lips, finally realizing why the pitcher looks so damn smug. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Rio is packing</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha raises her head and notices the slight, almost imperceptible, bulge Rio has hidden beneath her slacks. Her jaw drops slightly, a breathy moan slips out of her throat when she grinds against the concealed strap on. Her brain tries to think about when Rio could've possibly put that on without her knowledge.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When did you…” She trails off with a soft gasp when the raven haired woman begins rocking against her. Rio smirks, triumphant and pleased to have sufficiently shocked the brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio reaches over and works the vibrations back up to half power as she speaks, “Remember when you were complaining about how long I was taking in the closet? I’m guessing you’re glad I took the extra time to get ready for you.” Another roll of her hips just to tease her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha wants to roll her eyes and snap back with a witty comment but the rising vibrations inside her force a moan from her throat and her eyes to roll back behind her eyelids instead. Rio lets out a soft laugh, tossing her phone aside and leans forward to focus her attention on the brunette's chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't even think about coming,” Rio whispers threateningly when Agatha takes the new friction granted to her from the new position and runs with it, driving her hips vigorously against Rio's pelvis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>If the catcher hears the threat she certainly doesn't acknowledge it, a loud moan ripping from her chest as the vibrations pulse against her throbbing clit. Her hands strain against the silk, desperate to keep the other woman close as she nears her peak. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her panties are long soaked through by now and she has no doubt there is an embarrassing amount of wetness making a mess of Rio’s nice slacks. She would feel embarrassed about it if it weren't Rio's fault. Sharp praises and breathless commands leave her lips between cursing moans. The only confirmation that the words aren’t completely in her head are hums of pleasure and grunts echoing her words from below her chin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Otherwise, Rio keeps her hips still, letting Agatha take control of her pleasure if only for a minute, and continues the targeted torture to her aching nipples. A tongue lavishing one nipple while the other is manipulated under deft fingers all while the other hand holds her chest still with a bruising grip on her ribs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is a second, a half a second to be exact, from her climax when the vibrations stop entirely. A whine leeches from her throat and her hips jog up harshly to make up for the sudden lack of stimulation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is quick to lean back and pin her hips to the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Motherfucker</span></em><span>,” Agatha hisses venomously, not really meaning the insult aimed at her girlfriend, but also rethinking that as soon as she hears Rio’s amused laugh. “Fuck you.” She grunts a little more genuinely and couples the words with a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A smug smirk shines back at her, “Maybe later.” Rio quips easily. Agatha doesn't know how she has survived this long with a girlfriend this annoying. Is being fucked too much to ask for? She has to remind herself why she agreed to this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look at the mess you made,” Rio tsks, a shake of her head to accompany the disappointed words as they both look down to see Agatha's arousal coating the front of her slacks. Even with the lights being dim and the slacks being black, the large wet spot is as clear as day. Agatha refuses to be embarrassed by it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll pay for dry cleaning.” She responds dryly and locks their eyes once more. “Now, if you would let me come-” Agatha begins with a low growl until she is interrupted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought you would want to come on my cock?” Rio asks innocently, putting a feigned look of confusion on her features, a stark contrast to the glinting excitement and lust in her eyes. The words contradicted the sweetness of her voice. It is infuriatingly annoying and sexy. It makes Agatha want to throttle her as she takes every inch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio holds back a smirk and uses one hand between them to slip her finger under the gusset of purple lace panties and tug them aside. A soft moan leaves her at the sight of Agatha’s pussy absolutely dripping with arousal, coating every inch of fabric and skin nearby. How wet this woman can get still leaves her speechless </span><em><span>every single time</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She carefully removes the toy inside of the brunette, biting her lip at the way sweet moans mix with the sound of wetness, and tosses it to the side to be cleaned later. She uses the thumb of one hand to tease through her arousal while the other works on opening her belt and unfastening her slacks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha watches on labored breath, tucking her chin to her chest to look and roll her hips only slightly as she is granted some friction. She has to bite her bottom lip to keep in a ridiculous moan as soon as the dark green dildo comes into view. Partially because the color lets her know Rio will enjoy fucking her from the smaller insert inside of herself, possibly even come from it, but also because the pitcher is the vision of raw desire and striking beauty. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s dark, lustful eyes smolder with hunger. Rosy cheeks burn with heat, her red, swollen lips part with shallow, needy breaths, each exhale heavy with want. The unbuttoned row of her shirt teases at bare skin, exposing the deep curve of her cleavage - an open display of invitation if only Agatha could reach. The dark green dildo jutting from her clothed hips through the part in her slacks still wet with Agatha’s arousal. All of it a dedication to making the other woman crumble. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio takes the dildo in her palm, giving it a quick pump with her fist, moaning softly at the friction against her own throbbing cunt. Her other hand returns to Agatha’s hip to keep her still as she brings the tip of the dildo to her entrance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio whispers, dragging the dildo through her wetness and shifting closer to reach her clit. Agatha moans, fighting against the tight grip on her hip, grinding shamelessly against the silicone. The sound of arousal coating the dildo is enough to make Rio force her eyes closed and her breath to stutter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your pussy is so fucking wet.” Rio feels a smidge of her restraint slipping, opening her eyes and watching as the dildo dips into her entrance. Wanting a better view, she uses both hands to push on strong thighs and bring her knees up to her chest, spreading her open and humming proudly when Agatha’s legs stay still for her. She switches back and forth between slipping the tip of the dildo inside of her girlfriend and teasing her clit all while slowly jerking the dildo to relieve some pressure that had built up inside of her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha gasps softly, just the tip feels like a stretch, the strap on will feel huge inside of her after so long without it. She whines softly, cutting it off as her hips jerk for more. She should be embarrassed, ashamed for humping so desperately but four times to the edge and back has driven her insane. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t wait any longer. “</span><em><span>Oh fuck</span></em><span>.” She pushes forward, jaw dropping open as Agatha’s cunt clamped tightly around the dildo and pushing back against her. Agatha’s knuckles turn white as she grips the silk binding her hands and forces herself to relax. Even still, the dildo is big, she picked it out after all, and the stretch is a delicious burn that she leans into. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have neglected you, haven’t I?” Rio grunts, placing her thumb over the brunette’s clit to rub gentle circles, pleasure coating the dildo as she continues pushing inside. “Your pussy is so tight I can </span><em><span>feel it</span></em><span>.” A breathless moan escapes the raven haired woman when she bottoms out, hips pressed flush against the back of trembling thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha thinks she might pass out. The stretch, the burn, the depth. Rio spewing filthy words and moaning with the feeling of fucking into her. Her legs shake and her eyes flutter closed in pleasure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh God</span></em><span> - Rio, fuck, feels too big.” Agatha mutters softly, shaking her head slightly as she bites into her bottom lip and groans as she struggles to accommodate the girthy dildo. Rio is careful to stay in place as she reaches for a toy at the end of the bed, a deep purple wand vibrator, and turns it on low. Blue eyes flash open in excitement just as the head of the wand presses against her sensitive clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Jesus fucking christ</span></em><span>,” Agatha gasps, arching into the vibrator and clenching deliciously around the dildo. Rio smirks at the sight, circling the brunette’s throbbing clit with the vibrator for a few seconds before slowly pulling back her hips for a shallow thrust. Less resistance pushes back against her this time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s it, baby, relax. You take me so well.” Rio groans as she bottoms out. Agatha cries out softly, feeling every inch driving into her, the praise washing over her like a heat wave, the fire settling to coil tightly in her gut. Rio takes her time, working up to deeper and faster thrusts, just barely holding herself back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio.” Agatha wants nothing more than to reach out and pull the woman on top of her, feel her weight and be buried beneath her, but her hands stay tied to the bed frame. As if reading her mind, which Agatha isn’t entirely convinced she can’t do, the raven haired woman leans forward, hips pumping a little deeper with the new angle, lips wrapping around her aching nipples. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So fucking good for me, Agatha.” Rio mumbles before sucking harshly at her other nipple and leaning further as she bottoms out to take Agatha’s lips and swallow her moans. Her tongue swipes for entrance and easily wins the miniscule fight for dominance, matching her rhythm and kissing Agatha deeply. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is struggling to keep herself together. She wants to beg and claw and scream for Rio to pick up the pace, to rail her into the damn mattress. However, she is stubborn and shaking with the effort it takes not to tear their lips apart and do just that. When Rio breaks the kiss, panting for breath with wild eyes, sitting back to only </span><em><span>slightly</span></em><span> pick up the pace, Agatha is speaking before she can think. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck me, Rio. I- Ple-” Her jaw snaps shut, cutting off the pathetic plea, refusing to lose the simple game of dominance between them. Rio’s thrusts stutter and eyebrows raise in surprise. Agatha wonders if it was quiet enough that her words could’ve been mistaken. Not quite. The pitcher’s hips come to a halt flush against her and she groans at both the depth and the pause. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What was that?” Rio husks, that not-so-innocent sweet tone coming back once more. Dark eyes flashing with greedy pleasure and triumph because </span><em><span>the</span></em><span> Agatha Harkness has voluntarily begun to </span><em><span>beg.</span></em><span> Oh, this is going to inflate her precious ego to no end. Agatha fights the urge to whine, wrapping her legs around strong hips and bucking against her instead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing, just - fuck me, Rio.” Agatha hisses, trying to move past her slip. Rio isn’t so eager to skip over her words. She removes the vibrator from her clit, clicking it off and pinning her hips to the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no, there was more than that.” Rio teases with a smile. Agatha groans and stays stubbornly quiet, looking anywhere but dark eyes. Rio narrows her eyes slightly before jogging her hips forward, forcing a moan out of the brunette. She reaches forward and grips her jaw, connecting their eyes, kissing her softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You were being so good for me just a few seconds ago.” Rio whispers, nipping at her bottom lip and sucking it into her mouth with a moan. “Don’t you want to be good for me? So I can make you come? Because good girls get to come.” Her tongue delves past Agatha’s parted lips, swallowing her moans as she keeps thrusting into her, picking up her pace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gasps into her mouth, moaning in the next breath and meeting her kiss with passion. She climbs to her climax but her determination and stubbornness has reared its head and she won’t give in so easily again. Her moment of weakness has passed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> make me come.” Agatha whispers sternly, leaning up and capturing Rio’s lips before she can pull back all the way, shoving her tongue past smirking lips. The raven haired woman can spot the telltale signs of a trap a mile away but she loves it - falling into it willingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah?” She questions, hips picking up speed to keep Agatha preoccupied with moaning. Her lips skate down to her neck, sucking and biting to create a mark just under her jaw. Agatha arches into her touch, throwing her head back to give her more room as their hips slam together in a steady rhythm. If they keep this up - if she can talk long enough, she will come.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You love fucking me too much.” Agatha states breathlessly, moaning in the next second and forcing her hips to snap forward to take each thrust of Rio’s cock harder and faster than the last. Rio groans softly, the rough thrusts pushing the strap on harder against her clit and deeper inside of herself. Her forehead rests on the brunette's shoulder with a soft gasp. Agatha goes for the jugular. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She brings her mouth right against Rio's ear and whispers, “You love watching me come, don't you, </span><em><span>sweetheart</span></em><span>?” An answering whimper makes her smile, her own moan filling the space between them before she continues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Love to watch me - love to </span><em><span>feel</span></em><span> me come around your cock?” Agatha’s breath catches in her chest when Rio digs her fingers into her hips, hard enough to leave bruises, and fucks into her like she </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> feel it. Each thrust made her body bounce off of the mattress and impale her on the dildo with just as much force. The thought that Rio could feel her makes her clench all on its own, walls fluttering as a moan slips out of her mouth, her body tensing in anticipation of her orgasm beginning to crest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Then, Rio stops, burying the dildo to the hilt and staying there. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha helplessly tries to continue her thrusts, muscles flexing and her wetness dripping from her cunt to pool on the bed. She whines at first, wanting so desperately to reach her orgasm, before it swiftly turns into a groan of anger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio fucking </span><em><span>chuckles</span></em><span> and Agatha knows she would’ve wrapped her hands around her throat if they were free. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, </span><em><span>Ags</span></em><span>,” Rio whispers tauntingly, biting at the bruising mark she just left with a pleased smirk. Agatha is going to kill her. “You are such a </span><em><span>tease</span></em><span>…” Rio trails off with a scoff, if she had a real cock she would be in real trouble, shaking her head as she pulls away to return to her first position kneeling between shaking thighs. Her eyes watch the brunette panting for breath, squirming on her cock with a look that could kill and her body flushed red with heat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Unfortunately for you,” She pumps her hips once then twice, noticing how a shiver rolls down Agatha’s spine at the motion, “I’m not the one who has been edged for the last hour.” Agatha’s eyes widened slightly. </span><em><span>Fuck, has it really been that long?</span></em><span> Rio slowly pulls out and Agatha grunts softly at the empty feeling. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Turn over.” </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>. Agatha feels her brain buffer before complying much to the pitcher’s amusement. More than eager to help, Rio moves her into position, enough silk sash to twist and keep her hands on the mattress along with her elbows. The new position opens her up, makes her vulnerable to Rio’s eyes and the pitcher certainly takes her fill. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just like this,” Rio leans closer, the slick dildo grazing Agatha’s thigh, using a hand to press her chest closer to the bed. “That’s it baby. Fuck, you look so good like this. I wish you could see yourself.” Rio groans, her hands continuing to push and pull Agatha into the exact position of her fantasies and the brunette is vibrating with the touch and attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio.” Her name is slowly starting to sound like a plea coming from those sweet lips and she loves it. Agatha rolls her hips back, rubbing her cunt against the dildo even if it offers very little friction. The pitcher hums softly, running her hands over the swell of her ass with a small smirk, bringing her hand down with a swift smack. Agatha gasps, the sting of the smack sending a bolt of pleasure straight to her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Remember your safeword?” Rio asks gently, using one hand to grip the base of the dildo and pump the toy with a soft moan while she waits. Her other hand swiftly unbuttoning her shirt and pulling it from her waist, letting it fall loosely at her sides. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Wanda</span></em><span>.” Agatha mutters reluctantly, arching her back to entice the other woman, cunt clenching for something to fill her, “More.” She manages to make it sound like a demand even though she knows the raven haired woman won't listen. Rio moans softly, biting her lip as she brings the tip to her entrance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More, hmm? So needy.” Rio almost sounds empathetic but Agatha can tell there is a pleased, smug smirk with her words even if she can't see it. Thankfully the teasing only lasts a handful of seconds before Rio caves to her own desires and begins slowly driving her hips forward. Agatha mewls with the stretch, the new angle making the dildo feel much larger, her hips shifting forward to get away from the overwhelming pressure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don't run, baby.” Rio husks, entranced by the scene unfolding in front of her, catching the brunette by the hips and keeping her still, “Relax, I'll go slow, I want you to feel every inch.” She reassures her girlfriend. Agatha feels her bones and muscles melt on command, her chest sinking lower to the mattress and spine arching to accommodate the toy. Rio groans lustfully, fingers flexing with restraint and head tipping back to keep herself from coming just from the sight in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy shit,” Rio whispers, feeling the toy bottom out as her hips press flush against Agatha's ass. The catcher groans, biting her lip to stifle a whimper but stays still even though her hips are begging her to move. Whether to slide off the dildo or somehow take more, she isn't sure. It feels good, full, and the soft panting grunts behind her only fuel the fire between her legs. She needs to come, </span><em><span>now</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck me Rio,” Agatha breathes out, bouncing her hips back then forward again, a lazy grind completing the motion when they press flush. Rio moans and immediately snaps her eyes down to watch as her grip loosens and she lets the woman take over. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>.” Rio sounds wrecked, her voice straining with desire and awe as her hands run over her ass, squeezing and aiding her movements by using a gentle pull with her hands. She could watch this all day and never be bored. When she can see the brunette taking more and more she decides Agatha has had enough control for now. Her hips thrust forward, drawing a gasp from her girlfriend and putting a smirk on her face. Her grip tightens on her ass, two handfuls of flesh making her groan softly before she brings a hand down on her other cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh, fuck,</span></em><span>” Agatha moans deeply, the stinging blow not as surprising anymore but damn does it feel good, her head falling forward to rest against the mattress. Rio rubs her palms over her reddened skin, squeezing possessively, her thrusts speeding up. It earns her another deep moan and hips pushing back to grind against her.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio leans forward, pushing her hips ever further as one hand comes to curl around the back of the brunette's thigh, right behind her bent knee. The other hand gains stability and leverage with its new placement on Agatha's shoulder. With this angle, holding the catcher in place against the bed, Rio can drive deeper than ever. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio - </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> - make me come.” Agatha's words are muffled by the bed, her hands finding purchase on the metal bar holding her hands hostage and throwing her ass back to meet each thrust. The dildo hits the sweet spot inside of her, sending her flying toward the fucking sky if how tight the orgasm coils inside of her is anything to go by. This one might kill her but she is desperate for it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nuh uh,” Rio breathes harshly, slowing her thrusts but not daring to change the depth, “Good girls get to come. I don't think you were being so good, do you baby?” Agatha is shaking, a panting mess of moans and whines, trying desperately to reach her peak that apparently only Rio can control. The coil in her gut is so close to snapping she feels any stubborn, defiant thought in her brain melt away like cotton candy in the rain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can be good. I'll be good,” Agatha breathes out, whines truly, her words muffled by the sheets as she slams her hips backwards in a desperate jerky motion. Rio’s groan of unadulterated pleasure zipping through her to settle between her thighs, feeding the inferno inside her to no end. Rio swiftly reaches forward to fist wild brown locks and pulls, her forearm pinning the woman still while her hips pick up the pace. Agatha releases a broken moan, her hips weakly bucking against the dildo as much as she can with the new stretch in her neck.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gonna be good for me, pretty girl?” Rio pants into her ear. She is struggling to contain her own pleasure, every thrust of her hips pressing the toy against her clit and stroking inside of her. Watching Agatha fall apart right in front of her makes her shake with need. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>,” Agatha groans passionately, the hand in her hair pulling her head back and letting her words fill the space between them, “So good. Can I come? Please? Rio, I need it - I need you, </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>.” Her orgasm creeps up her spine, waiting to snap and send her tumbling into pure bliss if only Rio would give it to her. Rio clenches so tightly around the insert inside herself she thinks she sees stars.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, baby. That's what I want to hear. You’re so fucking good for me - taking everything I give you.” Her hips stutter, producing a whine from the brunette, before she pumps harder, deeper, faster. She reaches off to the side to blindly find the wand and flicks it on high before reaching around Agatha's undulating hips to press the head against her clit. Her cry of pleasure is delicious.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Be </span><em><span>my</span></em> <em><span>good girl</span></em><span> and come on my cock.” She whispers into her ear before releasing the grip on her wild mane and gripping the back of her neck instead, pinning the catcher to the mattress as her hips snap into her. Agatha can’t do anything but take it, moaning and shaking as she is fucked into the bed, her orgasm crushing her seconds later. Unintelligible words slip from her lips to be swallowed by the sheets and the sound of her wetness dripping around silicone. Her vision flickers black as blood rushes through her ears like a freight train. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened in shock as a gush of wetness coats her thighs, hips still thrusting forward. “Holy fuck.” Her thrusts begin to slow for a second before Agatha's whispers of </span><em><span>more</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> reach her ears and she resumes the harsh thrusts once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels like she might die. Rio begins thrusting again and her cunt spasms so hard around the plunging silicone that Agatha feels more of her arousal pouring out of her. Never in her life has she come this hard. Her head is spinning. It's too much. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Luckily, Rio is in tune with Agatha's breaking point, her hips stopping flush against her ass and tossing the wand aside as the woman in front of her trembles through the violent aftershocks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha struggles to catch her breath, hips dropping limply toward the bed, falling into the mattress like a pile of useless muscle and bone. Rio follows her, keeping the strap buried in her cunt and catching herself with hands on either side of the brunette's hips. She swiftly reaches up to tug the silk sash free, Agatha’s hands falling to the bed and clutching weakly at the sheets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stay still. I'm going to pull out.” Rio whispers, running a soothing hand over Agatha's back. She waits until she hears some form of acknowledgment, a soft grunt, and slowly pulls back. Agatha groans, taking in deep breaths and trying to control her twitching muscles. The empty feeling inside her makes her ache in all the right ways. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus,” Rio husks in fascination, sitting back on her heels to look down at the mess between them. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Agatha squirted</span></em> <em><span>- twice</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The bed, their thighs, their stomachs are wet, covered in Agatha's arousal. Rio grips the base of the strap on and bucks into her hand with a moan. She just knows her own wetness is dripping past the insert to mix with Agatha’s. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The brunette, by the grace of God and every ounce of energy she has left, shifts onto her back at the sound from her girlfriend. The needy, desperate sound pulling her out of her post orgasmic haze. The image alone is enough to make her cunt clench around nothing and debate telling Rio to fuck her again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is kneeling, still dressed but her shirt is completely unbuttoned and untucked, and ultimately drenched from the waist down. The dildo coated in more than enough wet arousal to aid her hand pumping easily over the dildo. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come here,” Agatha husks hoarsely, she must've been loud.</span><em><span> Great</span></em><span>, her neighbors are going to give her even more shit than they already do for the deplorable, loud sex they have. Whatever, she will deal with them later. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio looks skeptical and reluctant at first before she steps off of the bed and strips down to nothing, tossing the strap on to the side, knowing exactly how she wants to come. She climbs back up Agatha's body and straddles her thigh. A deep, wanton moan slips past her lips at the first touch of her cunt grinding into Agatha's bare thigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not - </span><em><span>fuck </span></em><span>- I’m not going to last long.” Rio whimpers, her eyes slamming shut as she bucks her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As long as you come on my fingers, you can come as quickly as you want.” Agatha bargains, slipping her hand between them and cupping the pitcher where she needs her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, God. Yes, </span><em><span>fuck yes</span></em><span>. Deal.” Rio collapses, arms shaking and shoulders aching with the effort to keep herself from crushing the other woman. One finger then two swiftly fill her cunt and she takes them with a lustful moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, fuck, </span><em><span>fuck.</span></em><span>” Rio cries out, immediately grinding down onto her fingers and into the palm situated right at her clit. She tries to last longer than two seconds, distracting herself by latching onto pale skin and sucking a mark right above Agatha's collarbone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Desperate little thing, aren’t you, sweetheart?” Agatha whispers, finally having caught her breath, placing kiss after kiss on the pitcher’s throat. Her other hand comes around to tangle in dark hair and pulls, hard, a sharp gasping moan sounding in her ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ride my fingers until you can’t fucking move.” Agatha hisses, smiling when Rio curses and moans, cunt squeezing her fingers like a vice. Her teeth find purchase on her throat, making a striking mark that everyone will see at their championship game tomorrow. Pride swells in her chest at the thought. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The dangerous idea of becoming public with the pitcher slips into her mind with ease. The recurring thought has become a constant in her day to day life with her girlfriend. Especially when Rio gets attention from any woman she passes on campus, despite Rio’s persistence that she doesn’t give those women a single glance, she still feels uncomfortable that those women don’t know that Rio is </span><em><span>hers</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit, Agatha. I’m gonna- I’m gonna-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come? Yeah, you’re gonna come for me.” Agatha growls, </span><em><span>commands</span></em><span>, pulling harder on her hair. “Come on my fingers then come again until my hand is soaked to my wrist.” Rio comes undone, shaking on her fingers and crying out curses between gasping moans. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>If Agatha had any energy left she would put Rio on her back and use her mouth, desperate for a taste of her, instead she keeps Rio gasping for breath, filling her with three fingers to push her into her second orgasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She relishes in the tight walls clamping around her and pushing her to take more, every inch of her fingers and wonders if Rio would ever let her use the strap on. The thought alone makes her drop the grip she has on dark hair to grab a handful of the supple ass grinding on top of her, digging her nails into her delicious, flawless ass to hear Rio choke on a moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha knows Rio loves this just as much as she does - the switch. The fight for dominance tears them both apart no matter who plays which roles. They are the perfect match and no one can even compare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stumbles over her words between moans, “Agatha, I can't - </span><em><span>holy shit</span></em><span> - I don't think-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good, don't think.” Agatha hisses, biting down harder on a new spot on her neck and pushing the pitcher's ass to grind on her fingers. “Give me one more.” She demands, curling her fingers and trying to reach the one spot inside Rio that will send her to her third orgasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I-I'm gonna come,” Rio moans, dropping her head forward and weakly thrusting her hips with the help of the strong hand on her ass. She is exhausted, her thighs and arms are going to be jello after this and her pussy will be so deliciously sore after Agatha is done fucking her to </span><em><span>three</span></em><span> orgasms with </span><em><span>three</span></em><span> fingers. More than she’s ever taken, more than she's ever had, all for Agatha.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans, “I know you are, honey. I can feel your sweet little cunt squeezing me so tightly. Give it to me.” Her hips began to buck with each thrust of her hand, going impossibly deeper. Rio gasps and shudders as her third orgasm rolls through her like a tidal wave. The depth of Agatha’s fingers and the dirty words in her ear made her unravel so quickly when only seconds ago the idea sounded impossible. Her head drops, biting into the brunette's shoulder as she comes, grinding on slender fingers until she is twitching and overstimulated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Even then, grunting from the sharp pain in her shoulder, Agatha takes great joy in pumping inside of her a few more times just to see her girlfriend jump and groan. Rio collapses on top of the woman, face buried in her neck and weak hips dropping down on the hand still buried in her pussy because she is physically unable to keep herself up any longer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha runs her free hand up and down her spine, scratching lightly, and pulls out slowly. A soft moan catches in her throat at the wetness covering her fingers and palm. Rio breathes out harshly against her neck and sends goosebumps rushing over her skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think you kill me a little more every time we fuck,” Rio mutters, without the hand between them, she lets her body rest completely against the catcher. Agatha smiles and wraps her arms around the waist above her to keep her close.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ditto,” She husks back. Rio’s laugh makes her smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Didn’t know you could squirt.” Rio whispers smugly, placing kisses along the brunette’s throat. Agatha groans softly but a smile crosses her lips regardless. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re going to be even more insufferable than usual.” Agatha points out swiftly as she arches her neck to let Rio continue her exploration. Hands began caressing her sides, cupping her breasts and thumbing over her nipples to send sparks straight to her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am very proud of myself.” Rio states matter of fact, lips enveloping her nipple. Agatha moans quietly and arches into the touch but her hand weaves into dark hair to pull her mouth away with an audible pop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your stamina is truly staggering.” Agatha whispers, a pout already forming on Rio's lips because she knows what's coming, “We need to sleep. It's already midnight and the championship game is tomorrow.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“At noon!” Rio points out quickly, reluctantly letting Agatha slip out from under her, laying in the wet sheets with a wrinkle of her nose. Agatha steadies herself on the night stand with a quick breath, soreness already leaching into her tired muscles and making her legs shake. Not that that is unusual for her, not anymore, Rio has a beautiful habit of making her shaky and sore for days. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And coach wants us on the field at ten.” The captain retorts as she pulls on an oversized sweatshirt Rio has been leaving on her side of the bed. The smell of amber and bergamot filling her senses and making her lean heavily towards the decision to hop back in bed with the raven haired woman. She turns back to Rio as she pulls her panties on and freezes with wide eyes. Rio sits in a wet spot so large it’s comical. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the fuck?” Agatha whispers in awe. She knows she squirted but </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> she’s going to need a new mattress by the looks of it. Rio takes one glance at the sheets and smirks before sliding out of bed to stand beside the brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hot, right?” Rio teases, a wide smile on her face to speak of every ounce of pride filling her chest at the sight. Agatha huffs in disbelief and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Her tone, while scolding, has a breathless quality that softens the edges of the reprimand. Rio takes it more of a challenge than a warning. She side steps to stand behind the catcher, her hands smoothing over thong clad hips as she steps to press her front to her back. Agatha swallows roughly at the very clear, fresh memories plaguing her rational thoughts that only become more difficult to fight off with firm, hot hands on her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio husks in her ear, one hand slipping under the sweatshirt to move north in search of supple breasts, “Seeing </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> makes you feel hot, doesn’t it? Aren’t you wondering if you can do it again?” Agatha is wondering, that’s the problem. Her lips part, something along the lines of ‘</span><em><span>take a cold shower’</span></em><span> are poised on the tip of her tongue, but a breathless moan leaves her instead because Rio’s hands are skilled, and talented in more ways than one as they slip under lace.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let me try again.” Rio urges, the fingers currently rendering her girlfriend speechless dipping low to tease her entrance. Her other hand stays busy by plucking and grazing her sensitive nipples. Suddenly Agatha can’t think clearly and being worried about the championship game is far from her mind. Her head falls back onto Rio’s strong and stable shoulder with a soft groan as her eyes close. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are a </span><em><span>demon</span></em><span>, Rio Vidal.” Agatha moans, her aching cunt clenching around the two fingers pushing inside of her. Rio’s rich, dark laugh sounds at her ear, a shudder working through her at the sound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“God, I love it when you talk dirty to me,” Rio quips playfully, withdrawing her hands from the woman who gives a mix between a groan and a whine in protest at both her words and actions, she’s sure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bend over.” She yanks Agatha’s panties back down her legs, wondering why the hell she thought it was a good idea to put them back on in the first place, and uses a hand between her shoulder blades to lead her forward. Agatha catches herself with outstretched hands, once again feels her words pushed back down her throat in favor of a moan when two fingers slide effortlessly inside of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Needless to say, they didn’t go to sleep when they should have. That’s why they both look like steaming piles of shit when they walk into the dugout. Jen notices, </span><em><span>of course</span></em><span>, and sends them a knowing, smug smirk. Agatha glares and wonders how easily it would be to get away with murder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Late night Captain?” Jen teases softly when passing the brunette.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Zip it, Kale.” Agatha grunts, summoning a harsher glare just for the first baseman who preens at the reaction. Rio chuckles somewhere nearby, earning a similar glare but one that promises a lot more acts of retribution. It excites Rio in ways she can’t put into words. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Harkness,” Herb calls out to her, standing with Sharon near home base, waving her over. Agatha doesn’t let up her glare on the first baseman until she begins walking towards the two coaches. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s up?” Agatha greets bluntly when she finally stands in front of her coach. Herb looks pissed off and Sharon looks nervous, not uncommon, but the combination of the two at the same time raises some red flags. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The Salem Seven are challenging Rio’s status as pitcher.” Agatha blinks in shock, her eyes casting over towards the other dug out where the Salem seven have begun unpacking their bags and warming up for the game. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re joking.” Agatha deadpans, looking back to her coaches to see unreactive faces, “Okay, not joking. What the fuck is their problem?” She hisses exhaustively. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, no swear words, please, dear.” Sharon requests gently. Agatha ignores her as Herb gets to the meat of the problem. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They said we made last minute changes to the roster.” Herb sighs, sending a knee shaking glare towards the other team. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Agatha growls, fists clenching at her sides as she struggles to keep her voice low, “It’s not like we had a fucking choice. Wanda went rogue, planted weed on another player, they expect us to let her play after that stunt? Does she even go to the damn university anymore?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my,” Sharon whispers softly, appalled by the crude language, basically clutching her pearls, if she had any. Rio spots the tense nature of her girlfriend and glances at Jen who undoubtedly spots it too, sharing a concerned look. Whatever it is, it can’t be good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Unfortunately, yes. I have a feeling her parents have had their hand in a few different aspects of the situation.” Herb responds pointedly. Agatha groans and rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course they do.” She looks over towards the opponents dug out when she spots her. Wanda Maximoff, attempting to be incognito in a dark hoodie, standing off to the side of the dugout speaking in hushed voices with the head coach of the Salem Seven. </span><em><span>That traitorous bitch. </span></em><span>Agatha takes off without hesitation, determined to give the redhead a piece of her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, hold on- damn it.” Herb groans in frustration when he sees exactly who his captain is heading for. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen sees the problem quicker than Rio, “Oh, shit.” Jen’s eyes widen with excitement and a delirious little laugh escapes her as she begins jogging toward her captain. Rio follows aimlessly until red hair is revealed and moves towards the quickly approaching brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck.” Rio mutters under her breath, picking up her speed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha meets Wanda’s eyes, the redhead flinging back her hood and stepping onto the field, the air between them becoming heavily charged. “Haven’t you done enough damage?” Agatha hisses, watching the redhead get pulled back by one of the players. She doesn’t stop, moving in closer and closer until a hand is gripping her wrist to keep her at bay, only a few feet apart now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nowhere close to what was deserved.” Wanda growls back, eyes lighting red with fire from the Scarlet Witch. Jen keeps her captain restrained for all of two seconds, a fit of anger making the brunette wriggle from her grasp.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, I’ve done my best.” Jen mutters quietly, watching eagerly to see the fight unfold. Rio is quick to step between the two women, facing Agatha with a calming gaze. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Step back,” Rio whispers softly, hopefully, not necessarily wanting to spend another game in the Westview police department. Agatha clenches her jaw, feels her muscles twitch under her skin all while she keeps her gaze on the redhead. Herb steps between the women facing his catcher, blocking her view of the redhead and glaring down at her right over Rio’s shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look at that, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> to the rescue. You two are the perfect pair, huh? Remember when you used to do that for me, Agatha?” Wanda bites out quickly, mocking the two women. Agatha wants to kill her and Rio is finding it difficult not to let her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s enough.” Herb chastises quickly, sending a glare towards his former pitcher.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Wanda scoffs, “I’m just getting started, </span><em><span>Coach</span></em><span>.” The word is thrown out with venom, a scoff. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve got some nerve showing your face today.” Jen grumbles, eager to help fan the flames and get her own jabs in at the redhead. After the shocking news was spilled, every woman on the team cut ties with their former team member, choosing to side with Rio instead. Flashing red eyes spin to the first baseman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve got the nerve?” Wanda hisses, trying to move closer only to be held back. “This bitch-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Watch your mouth,” Agatha bites back, pushing against Rio’s hold, each woman pushing closer as tensions rise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus, you are pathetic. What has she ever done for you that I didn’t?” Wanda rips from the grip holding her back, coming to stand toe-to-toe with Herb who refuses to let her pass. Jen releases a puff of an amused laugh, thoughtless and unrestrained. Agatha sends her a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen, don’t.” Agatha growls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, please do.” Wanda snarls, clueless to the meaning of her own words that the other woman finds so amusing. Rio grimaces at the deadly look on the brunette’s face, knowing it won’t end well for anyone. The silence between the women is thick, tension falling heavy on all of their shoulders. To be fair, Jen didn’t say anything, but it takes one look from Jen glancing very knowingly at Agatha and Rio for the redhead to connect the dots. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, you’ve got to be joking.” Wanda gapes in shock, her anger taking a backseat to the surprise and confusion flooding her system. Her eyes zero in on the way Rio’s hands are steadily holding the catcher by the hips with ease and without shame. She wonders how she missed it before. Agatha huffs with her glare sharpening towards the first basemen before switching back to the redhead, daring her to say something. Wanda only sees the look as a challenge, her teeth clenching in a snarl. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re fucking her? </span><em><span>Her!?</span></em><span>” Wanda asks incredulously. Rio sighs and shakes her head. Out of all the ways she thought their relationship would be exposed, Wanda connecting the dots before the championship game wasn’t even on the list. Herb sends a raised, surprised but non-judgemental, eyebrow towards his players but neither Rio or Agatha meet his eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s none of your business, Wanda.” Agatha responds coldly. Wanda laughs, a cackle almost, eyes flickering between anger and disbelief.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re a real piece of work Agatha. You basically pushed me off the mound so your girlfriend could get first string. Unbelievable.” The redhead shakes her head. Agatha rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly, it is </span><em><span>unbelievable</span></em><span>, because it didn’t happen that way. You just wish you had someone else to blame for not being good enough.” Agatha bites back, shifting forward only for Rio to keep her back. Wanda’s jaw clenches and her eyes narrow before a thought comes over her and a slow smirk spreads across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What would </span><em><span>Mommy dearest</span></em><span> say about the two of you?” The words are mocking, dangerous and they cut like knives. Agatha feels her heart stutter in panic, her stomach twisting with fear because Wanda has a direct line to her mother and all the reason in her twisted, dark little mind to spill Agatha’s secrets. Rio doesn’t care for the threat, refusing to play referee any longer, spinning around to look at the redhead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep your mouth shut or I’ll do it for you Maximoff.” Rio hissed, pushing forward without restraint. Agatha is content to let her go, finding the protective nature of the move far too appealing, but Jen and Herb are quick to intervene before she can reach the redhead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Enough!” Herb finally jumps in, his brain struggling to follow the latest developments between the women. He turns towards his players and ushers them back. “We have a game to play. Get back to the dugout and let me handle this.” Herb gives them all a very stern look, watching them reluctantly walk away before focusing on discussing the problem with the Salem Seven’s Coach and umpire. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So…” Alice begins, tiptoeing around the very loud exclamation Wanda shouted across the field for all to hear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t want to hear a fucking word out of anyone of you unless you plan on getting punched in the face.” Agatha warns darkly, making sure to glare at every single player in the dug out to convey just how serious she is. Rio struggles to hold back a smirk, even more so when Darcy catches her eyes and raises her eyebrows suggestively. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Relax, Harkness, no one blames you for hooking up with a sex demon.” Jen smirks as she pushes past the catcher to gather her gear. The team laughs lightly at the jab, keeping an eye on their very scary captain as they do. Rio can’t help but let a small laugh slip.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Kale, I swear to god I will punch you. This is all your fault.” Agatha glares so hard her eyeballs feel like they’re going to explode. Jen simply rolls her eyes at the dramatics of the catcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Save that anger for the field, Captain. We have a championship to win.” Jen patronizingly pats Agatha on the arm as she passes her to get out on the field. The rest of the team quickly follows once they realize that deadly glare turns on them. Rio is the only one left in the dugout, fighting back a smirk, and possibly the only person on planet earth to withstand the fury of Agatha Harkness. It's a superpower, she tells herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I want to kill her.” Agatha hisses under her breath, plopping down onto the bench and pulling on her gear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda or Jen?” Rio asks curiously, seeing the answer going both ways. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha decides easily, “Both.” A decisive nod and a quick glare pointed vaguely towards the field and visitor dugout. Rio chuckles and helps Agatha stand from the bench before turning her around to tighten the straps of her chest plates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen is just riling you up,” Rio dismisses, Agatha responding with a soft grumble of annoyance, running her hands over the straps to verify they aren’t too tight then squeezing lightly at the brunette’s hips, ”Wanda, however, I would hide a body for you. No questions asked.” Agatha spins back around with raised eyebrows, surprised and amused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That is both psychotic and endearing.” Agatha mutters, flipping her baseball cap to face backwards and grabbing the catcher’s mask from her bag. Rio smiles widely, a crazed, wild look in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What can I say, you make me crazy.” Rio winks and slips past her captain but not without sneaking a hand around to squeeze her ass, eliciting a soft gasp of surprise from her girlfriend. It will get her in trouble later, she’s sure, and she can’t wait. Agatha takes a deep breath and walks out of the dugout after her pitcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb and Sharon nearly go to war on Rio’s behalf, refusing to walk away without his star pitcher on the mound. In the end the Salem Seven is forced to face the wrath of an angered pitcher and Wanda is stuck simmering on the sidelines regardless. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha settles behind home base, sending a glare toward the dugout, a few of the Salem Seven players catching her stray glare before it lands on a seething redhead. Agatha feels a triumphant cackle brew in her chest until it can no longer be contained. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio makes sure to show off on her allotted practice pitches, sending a message and refusing to hide the lightning speed at which the ball lands into the catcher’s glove. Agatha can’t get enough, her palm stinging and her cheeks pressing against her catcher’s mask with a wide smile. Rio returns the smile and a wink just as the first batter steps up to home plate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I should’ve known you were a spaghetti girl, Harkness.” </span><em><span>Ugh</span></em><span>, of course Fox is the first player up to bat. Agatha refuses to engage, sending her call to Rio for a fastball. “You know what that is?” Fox baits quietly, swinging with a curse as Rio’s pitch flies across home base to the catcher’s glove for a strike. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re like spaghetti,” Fox decides swiftly, whiffing at another pitch and making Agatha smile, but still talking, “</span><em><span>Straight until wet</span></em><span>.” She finishes the sentence just before she swings, another miss, grunting in anger as she strikes out. Agatha stands to throw the ball back to Rio, feeling invincible when the pitcher smirks and sends her a wink.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think you need some new material, Fox. That was just sad.” Agatha responds calmly, almost sounding disappointed, smiling wider when the woman sends a snarl her way. The first few innings proceed with the Salem Seven struggling to get on base and the Westview witches earning two points. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The entire team is buzzing with energy, the earlier altercation with Wanda not dampening their passion and determination in the slightest. Agatha makes sure every woman knows that the Salem Seven tried to disqualify Rio because they know the Westview team would kick their asses with all their players on the roster. They’re scared, and it shows, so the Westview Witches are priming for the final kill. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The trash talk began taking a turn for the worst in the fifth inning, the score settling at 7 - 9, in favor of the Westview Witches. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wanda says you’ve got a reputation </span><em><span>rook</span></em><span>.” The Salem Seven third baseman, Snake is her nickname, if Rio remembers correctly. She probably doesn’t. They’re all so forgettable. Agatha surveys the field, bases loaded, zeroing in on the raven haired woman undoubtedly getting herself into trouble on third base. An act she would’ve condemned before makes her smile now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that right?” Rio baits, barely containing her giddy smirk when the woman easily falls into her trap, “You know who would know all about my reputation?” She sends the woman a quick glance as her face twists in confusion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio never could keep her mouth shut, “Your mom.” Snake’s face twists with anger and disgust, pushing up from her slightly crouched stance to move in on Rio leading off the base. Rio doesn’t bother facing her, the crack of Monica’s bat hitting the ball straight between third and second has her pushing off third base. A jumble of curses and yells follow her into home base. Monica made it safe to first base, Dottie on second and Alice on third. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Seconds after Rio’s cleats touch home base it feels like she runs into a wall. Her momentum isn’t enough to throw her to the ground but Fox’s hands certainly are. The wind is knocked out of her as she lands on her back, pain radiating in her shoulder, eyes struggling to focus on the sky above her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is out of the dugout as quickly as Herb, Sharon staying back to keep the rest of the team on the bench. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell was that? My runner had already tagged the base - she doesn’t even have the ball!” Herb yells, not worrying about his player on the ground when Agatha is right beside him. Sure enough, Agatha takes a knee beside Rio, her concern taking precedence over her anger.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha places a gentle hand on her stomach, “Breathe, sweetheart.” She forces her heart to calm, waiting for the pitcher to suck in a stuttering breath before she releases her own. Rio blinks a few times, focusing on the brunette beside her and forcing air back into her burning lungs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Rio huffs, wincing slightly at the uncomfortable feeling in her chest, “You do that all the time?” Agatha lets out a small laugh and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, with pads, but yeah.” Agatha raises to her feet when Rio’s breathing has returned to normal, offering her hand. Rio grunts softly as she’s pulled to her feet, her shoulder lighting hot with pain from the movement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What is it?” Agatha notices the pain twisted on Rio’s features even when she waves her off. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing, just landed on my shoulder harder than I thought.” Rio walks past Herb and the umpire still arguing about the incident as Agatha leads her back to the dug out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not nothing. Sit.” Agatha doesn’t give her any room to refuse, pushing her to sit on the bench and taking up the spot beside her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Way to take a hit, Vidal.” Lila says respectfully and smiling when Rio responds with a prideful smirk. Agatha rolls her eyes and gently prods at the muscle beneath her jersey. Rio sucks a quick hiss between her teeth from the sharp pain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shirt off.” Agatha says quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widen, “We’re kind of in public here. Maybe wait until we’re alone to get under my shirt?” The tease is harmless but Agatha’s answering glare is not. It takes one pointed look at the woman’s shirt before the pitcher gives in. Rio complies, painfully slipping her jersey over her head to expose her upper half, clad in only a sports bra, to intensely concerned blue eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you giving everyone a show now, Vidal?” Jen teases, a few of the other women letting loose wolf whistles. Agatha shuts them up with a glare before focusing back on her girlfriend. Her shoulder, while hot, doesn’t seem red or swollen - yet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See? I’m fine. Nothing to worry about.” Rio insists, the once sharp pain already becoming a dull, throbbing reminder. Agatha narrows her eyes and reaches out to grip Rio’s chin in her hand, locking their eyes with a stern look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you’re lying to me-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wouldn’t dare.” Rio interjects swiftly, softly, meeting the brunette’s gaze with sincerity. Agatha releases her hold and studies the woman as she slips her shirt back on, no signs of noticeable pain to be shown. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well?” Herb questions as he steps back into the dug out, hands on his hips as her eyes scour the pitcher for signs of distress. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good as new, Coach. Agatha has healing hands.” Rio’s lips spread with her signature sly smirk and glances at the brunette beside her who looks less than thrilled with her words. Herb sighs and shakes his head, her antics becoming a familiarity since joining the team. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re sure? You have the rest of your college career to play - and then some.” Herb double checks, glancing to his captain for reassurance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I promise Coach.” Rio persists, pushing off the bench to watch the game. Agatha and Herb share a look, </span><em><span>watch her</span></em><span>, unspoken but a mutual agreement of concern. Rio is tough and often puts up a front to uphold that reputation. Agatha won’t let her ruin her shoulder at the expense of her ego. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The sixth inning is just as feral, the Salem Seven picking more fights than fly balls. Even Dottie, the most docile of the group, storms back to the dugout cursing the entire team after striking out. Fox looks far too smug about it. Rio makes it her mission to send the aggravating woman to the bench. Fox already has one technical foul against her from the assault earlier, another would get her kicked out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The Witches step out onto the field, feeling the heat and basking in their anger, itching for some payback. They’re still on top, 9 - 11, but that doesn’t mean the Salem Seven doesn’t deserve to get kicked while they’re down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio takes a second to roll out her shoulder, slowly working through the motions of her pitch to ensure her range of motion isn’t impeded, smiling when the joint moves freely. An ache has settled deep into the joint, a bruise she’s sure, but overall it feels good. Agatha watches her carefully and nods encouragingly when she catches hazel eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The first pitch lands in Agatha’s mit flawlessly, accompanied with a sting the catcher relishes, one that only comes from the raven haired woman’s pitch. A breath of relief leaves her chest as she throws the ball back to the pitcher’s mound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The sixth inning leaves the score cutting it close, 11 - 12, too close for comfort. Rio steps up to the base at the bottom of the seventh, third and second loaded, two outs under their belt, and her bat waiting to swing. She digs her cleat into the dirt and drops her hips, waving her bat over her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s that shoulder, rookie?” Fox baits, signaling her pitcher for a fastball. Rio tips it, the metal clink giving the team hope as it gets called as a foul ball. Her heart hammers in her chest, knowing very well how her swing could win them the championships if she can manage it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, just fine. Thanks for asking Fox.” Rio sends her a deviously sweet smile, making the catcher thoroughly confused, readying her stance again. “You know people are wrong about you.” Rio turns the tables so easily the catcher doesn’t even know how to respond. A botched curve ball lands outside of the plate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Fox hisses, struggling to focus now that Rio has her brain tumbling for answers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, your coach over there says you’re about as generous as a teenage boy.” Rio sighs with a shake of her head, clocking the woman’s furious, red face out of the corner of her eye as she fights off a smirk. “In bed, that is.” Rio clarifies swiftly, the pitch lands in the dirt when the catcher stands, forcing Rio out of the batter’s box. A triumphant smile crosses her features for just a second before she fixes it to look shocked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut your fucking mouth,” Fox hisses, gripping a fistful of Rio’s jersey and jerking her closer. Rio, ever the instigator, raises her hands in faux innocence and looks confused by the catcher’s outburst. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s it,” The umpire pushes them apart and takes off his hat, pointing at Fox before shoving his finger dramatically towards the dugout. “You’re out!” The woman’s eyes widen in shocked horror as Rio takes pleasure in watching the ejection. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Herb sighs with a shake of his head, “What the hell am I going to do with her?” He begins making his way back to home plate for the third time today. Agatha smiles adoringly at her girlfriend who looks very smug to watch the argument unfold before her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>like</span></em><span> her,” Jen observes in pleasantly surprised awe, putting extra emphasis on the word with a smirk. Agatha glances at the first basement and rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do I look like someone who would be around people I don’t like?” Agatha fires back, feigning ignorance. Jen laughs and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, you </span><em><span>like like</span></em><span> her.” Jen reiterates, even more emphasis on the word </span><em><span>like</span></em><span>, enjoying the way the other woman squirms under the implication. Agatha works her jaw slightly as she sends the woman a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up, Kale.” The weak rebuttal only makes the woman smile wider. The Salem Seven get their players back in line, a new catcher crouched behind the plate, awaiting Rio’s mind games. Rio steps back from the plate, studying the pitcher, Rat is her nickname, maybe - again, they’re all so forgettable. It’s almost imperceptible, but the hesitation before the pitch is one Rio knows well when she doesn’t connect with her catcher. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio felt it with Darcy, the hesitation that led to a solid connection eventually, but it took some work. With Agatha, the connection was immediate and Rio never faltered. She settles back beside home plate with a smirk, no longer needing her mouth to leech the flaws from the other team. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sure enough, the next pitch is a fastball, sprinkled with hesitation, making it slow enough for Rio to bring her bat around for a grand slam. The satisfying ping sends satisfaction rolling through her as she tosses the bat aside and sprints to first base. The ball lands in the outfield smack dab between the center and left outfielders, both who stutter and hesitate on grabbing the ball. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Their uncertainty lets Lilia score at home base, 11 - 13, Rio to slide into second just as the ball lands in the second baseman’s glove, and Alice settling triumphantly on third. One glance between Rio and Alice seals the deal, they’re gonna steal. Darcy is up to bat next and she may as well have a cannon on the end of her bat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The dugout waits anxiously for the next move, shouting their support and encouragement for their players on the field. The Salem Seven pitcher is feeling the heat, literally, wiping the sweat from her hand onto her pants and shaking off the call given to her by the catcher. Rio follows Alice’s lead, smiling deviously as the short woman takes a step off of the base and following suit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The pitcher, Rat, hesitates even more, her eyes flickering between home base and third where Alice takes another step. Rio does the same, making the pitcher tick with paranoia as she glances over her shoulder, unsettled. Rio can’t help it, she jumps slightly, teasing the player just to see her whip her head around. Rio steps back safely onto the base with a smile. </span><em><span>Too easy</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They’re toying with them.” Herb mutters. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You disapprove?” Agatha wonders, smiling on in amusement as her girlfriend takes another step off the base. She can’t find it in herself to be upset with her pitcher. The Salem Seven deserves the taunting and teasing even more after the low blows they’ve been trying to pull. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honestly,” Herb turns slightly, an honest to god smirk crossing his features, “I think that’s exactly what this team needed.” Agatha's lips stretch with a diabolical smirk of her own. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The crack of the ball hitting into the outfield pulls them out of the conversation. The left fielder scoops it up quickly and launches it to the awaiting glove of the first baseman. Darcy makes it to first base right before the ball makes it to the first baseman's glove. Alice crosses home base well before the ball slices through the air to the catcher’s glove. Unfortunately, it puts Rio into a pickle, literally. She skids to a halt halfway between home base and third. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, shit,” Agatha groans under her breath, fingers coming to tangle in the chain link fence in front of her as the ball gets tossed back to the third baseman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck…” Rio hisses, studying her captors and inching back towards third base when the ball is passed back to the catcher. She hasn’t seen too many successful attempts to get out of a pickle but she’s damn sure going to try. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Each bench is cleared, every player and onlooker waiting to see the final play of the season. Jen and Lila are right alongside Agatha cheering encouragement and advice to their teammate. Meanwhile, Agatha is seconds from having a heart attack when the raven haired woman slips in the dirt heading for third base. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Except, it wasn’t a slip at all. It’s a slide, a very short and misleading slide because the catcher throws it back to the third baseman and the player rushes her opponent for a tag. Rio feels a smirk tug at her lips because she knows for a fact that she is fast, faster than the lumbering third baseman and definitely faster than the fumbling catcher who seems to panic at Rio’s sudden advancement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The ball is thrown, it whips over Rio’s head but the catcher isn’t prepared, eyes jumping up to the neon ball just in time to thrust up her glove. Rio dives, head first, arms out stretched, reaching for home plate set squarely between the catcher’s feet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A glove, weighted heavily with a ball, slams into Rio’s back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The dust settles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio holds her breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Safe!</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A breath puffs from her chest and her head drops to the dirt with a smile gracing her lips. Agatha is the first to leave the dugout, rushing to home base to envelope Rio in a strangling hug as soon as she is back on two feet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are fucking insane,” Agatha hisses when she pulls away, fighting every urge in her body to plant a devastating kiss on the pitcher’s lips. Rio smiles proudly, feeling her chest tighten with the one feeling she hasn’t felt before, the little sparkle in blue eyes makes her wonder if Agatha feels it too. They are pulled apart by the rest of the team swarming the field.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You crazy bitch.” From Lilia, it's a compliment. One after the next, the team congratulates each other. In a sportsmanlike manner, propelled by Herb and Sharon’s insistence, the team lines up to shake hands. Not a single one of the Salem Seven utters a word of congratulations that isn’t accompanied with a death glare or spiteful mutter of hateful words following it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The awards are passed out, each Westview Witch sporting a heavy gold medal around their necks, and Agatha is presented with the large trophy to be displayed somewhere on campus to show off their triumph. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha catches Rio watching her, proud and adoring, she chances a quick wink in her direction. The sparkle in brown eyes makes her stomach twist in such a delicious way. </span></p>

<p><span>“Relax,” Rio nudges her shoulder into Agatha’s with a smirk. The brunette takes a deep breath and summons a hopefully genuine looking smile for her girlfriend, though it must look a little forced because the other woman simply chuckles in response. Her smile drops and her eyes narrow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up,” Agatha grunts, shifting on her feet nervously when Rio reaches out to knock on the door. After the championship game the first thing Rio wanted to do was visit her abuelita. It took all of two seconds for her to decide it was time for Agatha to meet her grandmother as well. Agatha wasn’t going to refuse, not when Rio looked so hopeful and excited. She was too - just nervous. She can charm and woo with the best of the socialites she grew up around but something tells her Rio’s Abuelita would see right through the facade - much like the young woman did. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She is going to love you, Agatha.” Rio slides a hand on the small of her girlfriend’s back and leans in to place a soft kiss on the brunette’s cheek. Agatha feels her nerves quell, for a second, with her grounding touch, until they flare up once again as the door opens. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>An elderly woman answers the door, a wide smile stretching across her face and her eyes flashing bright with excitement at her guests. She is short and her skin wrinkled with age but Agatha can spot the relation between the two women in seconds. Whether it be the wide smile or the glint in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¡Ay, mi preciosa nietecita! Ven acá, dale un abrazo a tu abuela.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Oh, my precious granddaughter! Come here, give your grandmother a hug.</span></em><span> Rio’s smile matches her grandmother’s, lighting up her eyes. Rio leaves Agatha’s side, wrapping her grandmother into a tight squeeze that is reciprocated equally if not more so. Agatha feels her stomach twist with nerves when the older woman catches her eye over Rio’s shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah,” The woman pulls away, locked in on the stranger at her doorstep, moving closer with her hands outstretched, “You must be the </span><em><span>novia</span></em><span>.” Agatha is severely lagging in the Spanish department but she does know a few things, </span><em><span>novia</span></em><span>, meaning girlfriend, is one she knows. A blush threatens to heat her cheeks as she offers her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mrs.Vidal-” Agatha barely gets the words out before the older woman cuts her off. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no, no,” The stern voice shocks the brunette, fearing she has messed up already, Agatha freezes, “Gabriella. Understand?” She releases a breath of relief and a small smile takes over her concerned features. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gabriella, it's so nice to meet you.” Agatha tries again and earns a bright smile at the change of title. The older woman takes Agatha’s hand with two of her own and squeezes lovingly with a few short shakes in greeting. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The couple is ushered inside, the comforting home wafting with the familiar scent of sweets baking in the oven, and the older woman rushing towards the kitchen muttering something in Spanish. It makes Agatha smile when Rio follows after the woman, speaking in their shared language to decipher the mutterings of her grandmother, both women disappearing into what she assumes is the kitchen. Agatha feels slightly out of place, shifting in place before her eye catches a photo of interest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio, incredibly young Rio, maybe six or five, a birthday cake coated in purple and green frosting shoved into her face, covering her hands as she smiles at the camera. Agatha feels her heart swell. A shocking thought crosses her mind. </span><em><span>Would their children adopt Rio’s infuriatingly charismatic charm?</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha?” Rio says softly, feeling a tingle of suspicion in her gut when Agatha looks guilty about something. The brunette smiles, wondering where that train of thought came from before shaking it off and following Rio into the kitchen. Her mouth waters at the smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies now resting on cooling racks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>,” Gabriella begins, saying the brunette’s name with all the giddy of a proud grandmother, sending Rio a special smile, “Mi nieta tells me you are an engineer.” The older woman places a few cooling cookies onto a plate and sets it down in front of the two of them.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, I- uh, yes. I’m majoring in energy engineering and minoring in physics.” Agatha responds swiftly. Rio eagerly reaches for a cookie only to have her hand smacked away by Gabriella. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Paciencia, chiquita, los invitados comen primero.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Patience, little girl, guests eat first.</span></em><span> Gabriella scolds with a stern look. Agatha smirks and takes a cookie as Rio frowns and mutters under her breath about not being a ‘little girl’ anymore. At her grandmother’s nod, the pitcher snags a cookie from the plate and groans happily as the cookie melts in her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That is </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> impressive, Agatha.” Gabriella says proudly. This woman has known her for two seconds and has already begun to heal the wounds inflicted by Agatha’s own mother. She loves it, basks in the approval and smiles at the older woman. No wonder Rio didn’t want to move away to Westview. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio is the impressive one. Without her, we wouldn’t have come close to winning our championship game.” Agatha praises, smiling wider as Rio’s cheeks heat red with embarrassment at her grandmother’s surprised gasp of excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¿Mi nieta?</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>My granddaughter?</span></em><span> Gabriella reaches across the kitchen island, gripping Rio’s chin in a gentle grip and a practiced stern look in her eyes. Rio swallows the bite of cookie in her mouth, feeling like a young girl with her hand caught in the cookie jar, wide eyes staring back at her grandmother. “</span><em><span>¿Por qué no me lo dijiste?</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Why did you not tell me? </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¡Lo iba a hacer! Lo prometo. Quería decírtelo en persona.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I was going to! I promise. I wanted to tell you in person. </span></em><span>Rio says quickly, earning a forgiving look from her grandmother and a smile from Agatha. The brunette realizes she will certainly need to brush off her old high school Spanish lessons. Especially when Rio sounds so good speaking it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mhmm, my granddaughter tells me nothing.” Gabriella insists playfully, sending a cheeky wink Agatha’s way, making her laugh between bites of the most delicious cookies she has ever eaten. Rio sends a glare to counteract the wink but the smile on her face smothers her feigned displeasure. She loves to see the two most important women in her life getting along so well. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It takes a village to keep her in line.” Agatha teases. Gabriella chuckles to herself, pleased to find that her granddaughter’s girlfriend has a sense of humor. All while Rio’s jaw drops slightly at the retort. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I like her. Beautiful, smart </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> funny.” Gabriella gushes with a happy smile before sending a light smack to Rio’s arm. “</span><em><span>¿Por qué no la trajiste antes?</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Why did you not bring her around sooner? </span></em><span>Rio rubs pitifully at her arm with a frown. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mírala. No quería asustarla.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Look at her. I didn’t want to scare her away.</span></em><span> Rio defends herself swiftly, in a hushed manner, as if Agatha could understand a word of it anyway. Nonetheless, the admission still makes her cheeks turn red when her grandmother smirks mischievously. Agatha can’t believe the resemblance between the two women. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Ah, ya veo. Amas a esta mujer.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Ah, I see. You love this woman.</span></em><span> Rio’s face physically cannot get redder. She hides her face in her hands, avoiding her grandmother’s knowing look and Agatha’s curious and inquisitive gaze. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Abuela, por favor. Solo llevamos tres meses juntos.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Abuela, please. We have only been together for three months. </span></em><span>Her words come out like a groan but she can’t hide the twinge of pure embarrassment in her voice even through the spanish accent.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you two talking about?” Agatha wonders curiously, narrowing her gaze on her girlfriend while snagging another cookie from the plate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing!” Rio answers quickly, shooting a pointed look towards her grandmother. Gabriella receives a curious look from the brunette but she raises her hands in defeat, waving off the question with expertise. In two seconds flat the elderly woman has Agatha distracted with a different topic, dinner, thrusting her into learning how to julienne and dice vegetables. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>On more than one occasion Agatha earns a gentle reprimand on how to hold a knife or the vegetable - as well as one scream of concern from Rio when she nearly slices her pinky off - but she enjoys cooking for the first time in her life. All because of Rio and Gabriella who have welcomed her into her home with open arms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It makes her envious, wondering who she would be today if she grew up in a family like this. While their family is small, Rio is loved, supported and smothered in wise advice. It is a stark, jarring difference between Agatha and her own Mother. She is pulled from her thoughts when Rio attempts to act out the final score of their win that day, joining in on the laughter with a comfortable ease that only comes when she is around the gorgeous, raven haired woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The day slips away from them, hours and hours have passed before Rio insists they have to return to campus and join the festivities celebrating their win. They leave the house a handful of minutes later, arms full of treats and goodies thrust upon them by the sweet older woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha has learned that Gabriella doesn’t take no for an answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I understand why you wouldn’t want to leave her. She is amazing.” Agatha utters fondly, sliding into the driver's seat of her bronco as Rio settles into the passenger seat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know what I would do without her.” Rio admits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s a good thing you won’t have to find out any time soon. That woman is as strong as an ox.” Agatha insists, refusing to think of a reality where Gabriella is anything but present and taunting her granddaughter. Rio smiles happily, so pleased to know that just an evening spent with her abuelita can change Agatha into a sappy, mush of a woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Strong as an ox</span></em><span>, huh? You speak in metaphors now?” Rio teases easily. Agatha rolls her eyes but can’t hide her smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whatever. You better act right. I’ll tell on you.” The threat makes the pitcher’s jaw drop in mock offense. Then the brunette sends her a stern look and she realizes how real the threat could be. </span><em><span>Well, damn, maybe the new duo will come to bite her in the ass</span></em><span>. Nonetheless, it makes her smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did she say that was making you blush so hard?” Agatha wonders after a few seconds of comfortable silence. The reminder of the conversation makes Rio flush with embarrassment once more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing, she was just teasing.” Rio insists but Agatha isn’t buying it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Amas a esta mujer.</span></em><span>” Despite saying it as slowly as possible, Agatha butchers the foreign words with a rough accent. Rio burst into a chuckle, loving the effort but amused all the same. It earns her glare and an adorable pout from her girlfriend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Amas…a…esta…mujer.</span></em><span>” Rio says each word slowly, deliberately, waiting for Agatha to repeat it back to her until she has the pronunciation down. When Agatha is confidently speaking the sentence, she is quickly reminded why she was saying it in the first place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So?” The brunette prompts. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio questions cluelessly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What does it mean? Aren’t you going to tell me?” Agatha is stubborn, Rio knows this, so leaving this car without explaining those words is not happening. She sighs and faces forward, avoiding eye contact at all costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It, uh…It means ‘</span><em><span>you like this woman’</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Amas a esta mujer.</span></em><span>” Rio explains short and sweet. Not </span><em><span>exactly</span></em><span> the truth but close enough. </span><em><span>Like</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>love</span></em><span> - it's all the same really. Agatha hums softly, a small shiver racing down her spine at the gentle roll of the ‘r’ and fluidity of the words. It does something to her, hearing Rio speak in spanish, it always has and she fears it always will. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio hears the barely imperceptible arousal in her girlfriend's voice and glances over to the driver seat purely out of curiosity. She notices the sudden tension in Agatha’s shoulders, the soft way her tongue glazes over her lips to moisten them, and the far away look in her eyes. Rio isn’t one to pass up such a glorious opportunity to tease her significant other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you like the way that sounds, </span><em><span>mi novia</span></em><span>?” </span><em><span>My girlfriend</span></em><span>. Rio husks, reaching over to the brunette and sliding her hand onto her thigh with a gentle squeeze. Agatha can’t contain the blush that climbs up her chest, squirming under the sudden intense stare of her counterpart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sure, yeah. It sounds good.” God help her when her voice cracks. Agatha clears her throat and tries to focus on driving, namely not killing them, and ignoring the heat of the hand on her thigh. The hand currently inching up, higher and higher. Rio chuckles at that, leaning in across the center console. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¿Te gusta mi forma de hablar español?</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Do you like the way I speak Spanish?</span></em><span> Rio smirks at the very noticeable muscles jumping under her fingertips at those words. Even though Agatha is trying very hard to look indifferent, Rio sees right through her. Like always. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Apuesto a que desearías poder entender lo que estoy diciendo.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I bet you wish you could understand what I’m saying. </span></em><span>Rio pries apart the thighs trying to clamp around her hand, earning a warning look from her girlfriend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I’m driving.” Agatha sets a very small, nearly nonexistent boundary. Rio steps right over it. Agatha may, </span><em><span>barely</span></em><span>, appear indifferent but she is loving this.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then pull over, </span><em><span>mi novia</span></em><span>.” The pitcher orders, squeezing her thigh once more, “</span><em><span>Quiero toda tu atención mientras te susurro palabras dulces al oído.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I want all of your attention as I whisper sweet nothings in your ear.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“God damn it Rio.” Agatha groans softly, her grip on the steering wheel tightening with white knuckles. “We’re like </span><em><span>five minutes</span></em><span> from your dorm.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Five minutes too long,” Rio grunts back, her thumb swiping forward into the heat radiating between clenched thighs, earning a stuttering gasp, then a glare. She smirks regardless because Agatha can school her features all she wants but she can’t hide the arousal glinting in her eyes. “</span><em><span>Quiero saborearte mi corazón.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I want to taste you, my heart.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha has no discipline. As soon as Rio uttered those words, whatever the hell they mean, she was flipping on her turn signal and cutting off the car beside her to weave out of traffic. Ignoring the very smug woman beside her, Agatha navigates to a relatively empty part of the baseball field's parking lot.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The fields, really?” Rio questions in amusement. Agatha unbuckles her seatbelt and reaches over to pull on the bar beneath Rio’s seat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re really going to complain about where I park to fuck you?” Agatha huffs, pushing Rio’s seat back with a rough shove and loud clang. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, your fucking me, huh? You seemed pretty content with my hand between your thighs.” Rio teases, reaching over to put her hand where it rightfully belongs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Until Agatha smacks it away with a pitiful glare. She climbs across the center console and wedges herself between the glove box and Rio’s legs. She settles on her knees, shaking out her hair before beginning to gather it into a ponytail. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio might combust just from the sight. Fucking in the back of the Bronco may have been high on her bucket list but she didn’t expect Agatha to be knee deep in the passenger seat getting ready to eat her out within an inch of her life, if the way she is putting up her hair is any indication. Rio scrambles to unbutton her annoyingly tight black jeans. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can speak in spanish or not at all, understood?” Agatha kneels in front of her girlfriend, hair pulled into a messy ponytail, tugging the infuriating tight pair of jeans down to her ankles. Rio’s eyes are blown wide, dark and wanting, but she doesn’t respond. Agatha grabs the small waistband of the woman’s boy short panties and tugs roughly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Understood?” Agatha urges. Rio groans softly when the fabric bites into her skin and raises her hips to accommodate the shift. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck yes.” Rio mutters eagerly, nodding her head in agreement. All while not following instructions. Agatha narrows her eyes and pinches at the delicate skin of a tan outer thigh with little remorse. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ow!” Rio yelps quietly, jumping so hard her elbow slams into the side of the door and looking at the brunette with a furrowed brow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did I just say?” Agatha asks swiftly, reaching forward to tug Rio to the edge of the seat. She feels her own elbow dig into the side of the center console. Fucking in the front seat fo her car - not her brightest idea, but she’ll never admit that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mierda. Si, si, mi corazón. Por favor tócame.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Shit. Yes, yes, my heart. Please touch me.</span></em><span> Rio whispers, pulling the lever at the side of her chair to lean back, eyes briefly bouncing around their surroundings to ensure they’re still isolated in the back lot. Her hands grip the edge of the seat when Agatha leans forward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Keep talking to me just like that, sweetheart.” Agatha husks, using her tongue to brush over her clit. Rio moans, barely registering her girlfriend’s words, entranced by the view in front of her and nods her head in blind agreement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha, fóllame. Te sientes tan bien.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Agatha, fuck me. You feel so good.</span></em><span> Rio groans, bucking her hips. Agatha moans in response, the vibrations going straight to the pretty pussy in front of her. She is going to make it her goal to learn Spanish. She watches Rio’s wide eyes darken even further when she sucks on her clit. A smirk crawls across supple lips, a plan hatching in a devious mind, and Agatha knows she’s in trouble.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Te ves tan bonita cuando me comes el coño. Qué buena chica.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>You look so pretty when you eat my pussy. Such a good girl.</span></em><span> Rio praises. Agatha groans lustfully, not understanding much but a few words and still getting hotter and hotter because of it. Her nails dig into the thighs on either side of her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¿Te gusta cuando te hablo en español, chica sucia?</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>You like it when I talk to you in spanish, dirty girl?</span></em><span> Rio’s voice is smug but breathless, the air being stolen right from her lungs with every pass and suck of the brunette's mouth. Agatha nods, clueless but whole heartedly agreeing to anything Rio has to say. For right now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Quiero estar dentro de ti cuando te corras.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I want to be inside of you when you come.</span></em><span> Rio groans, bucking up for more when Agaths runs the flat of her tongue over her clit. “</span><em><span>Diciéndote obscenidades al oído y follándote hasta dejarte sin sentido.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Speaking filth into your ear and fucking you senseless. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels the heat radiating from between her thighs, hips already helplessly grinding forward for friction. She can’t wait. She drops one hand from Rio’s thigh to her pants, swiftly unbuttoning her jeans to shove her hand inside her ruined lace panties. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s jaw drops. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hijo de puta.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Mother fucker</span></em><span>. Rio hisses lustfully, watching closely as hooded eyelids flutter shut over dark blue irises and a moan vibrates against her clit, making her moan deeply in return. “</span><em><span>Así es. Tócate para mí.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>That’s right. Touch yourself for me. </span></em><span>She breathes out, the edge of bliss coming closer and closer. They might have a new record under their belt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans again, deeper and gutteral, bucking into her palm currently soaked in her arousal. The position she’s in and the restriction of her jeans forces her to hump into her palm and stroke her clit as opposed to riding her fingers like she would prefer - like Rio would generously provide. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>With a quick, glazed glance out the window to ensure they are still alone, Rio uses one hand to push up her shirt, slipping underneath her bra to pinch her nipple. Agatha feels a smirk begging to cross her lips, if they weren’t otherwise occupied. The cramped space allows them to be close enough for her to reach exactly what she wants. Rio gasps softly when Agatha’s free hand slips under the other side of her bra to tease her sensitive nipple, a moan following closely.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>No pares, mi corazón. Estoy tan cerca.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Don’t stop, my heart. I’m so close.</span></em><span> Rio whimpers. Teeth dig into her bottom lip, a deep moan rattles her chest, and her head falls back against the seat. Agatha grunts, sucking and licking until the pitcher’s hips are bucking into a rhythm of desperation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mierda. Me estoy corriendo.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Shit. I’m coming. </span></em><span>Rio groans, her other hand sliding into the taut hair at the back of Agatha’s head, keeping her close enough to grind against her tongue. “</span><em><span>Sigue adelante, mi amor.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Keep going, my love.</span></em><span> Agatha feels her heart stutter in her chest, eyes flying open to look at Rio who seems oblivious to what she’s said. </span><em><span>My love</span></em><span>. You don’t need to know Spanish to know those words. Agatha could die a happy woman as long as Rio says that again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Por favor no pares, mi amor.</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>Please don’t stop, my love.</span></em><span> Rio breathes out, voice shaking slightly before a moan bursts from her chest.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Dead. Agatha is dead, might even be in heaven if she didn’t know any better. Agatha groans lustfully, broken and desperate, as her eyes slam closed once more. Her own orgasm rushing up her spine as her mouth works twice as hard to ruin her sweet, beautiful girlfriend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Mutters and curses, in a mix of English and Spanish, slip past Rio’s lips with utter pleasure and desperation. Agatha’s own orgasm runs through her like a freight train. The Bronco is filled with nothing but curses, moans, panting breath and obscenely slick noises for the better part of a minute. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha finally pulls back to take a deep breath, a soft moan leaking past her lips when she exhales. She rests her forehead against Rio’s thigh, trying to simply breath while the rest of her orgasm works through her system. Her hips bucking weakly when her palm presses firmly against her overstimulated clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get up here,” Rio whispers, catching her own breath, tugging on the hand Agatha had let fall to her hip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I came already.” Agatha slowly pulls her hand from her pants, ready to wipe it off when Rio grabs her wrist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t ask.” She pulls. The brunette has no choice but to lean forward and watch as a skilled tongue licks from the base of her palm to her fingertips. A satisfied moan reaches her ear just in time to snap her out of the trance. She follows the second tug of her hand, climbing up from the footwell to straddle her girlfriend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grabs the waistband of Agatha’s jeans and tugs. It’s not ideal, not even close, but the tug brings the jeans to rest halfway down the brunette’s thighs. A soaked thong follows closely behind. Leaving just enough room for Rio to slide her hand between sticky thighs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Rio groans, floored once again by the wetness coating her fingers, “You’re so wet baby. Did eating me out in your car while I speak to you in Spanish truly have this much of an effect on you? You just had to touch yourself?” Agatha slides one hand into dark hair and steadies the other hand on her shoulder. She grips dark strands tightly and tugs to admonish the use of english like she so clearly told the woman not to use. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t remember telling you to speak English.” Agatha hisses, humming softly as her hips begin to roll for friction. Rio smiles up at the brunette, all too smug, sliding one finger inside of her girlfriend’s cunt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t you want to know what I said?” Rio wonders, intrigue lighting up blue eyes. Agatha nods her head with a moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Por favor tócame. </span></em><span>Please touch me.” Rio whispers, smiling wider when the brunette groans and clenches around her finger. She adds a second. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fóllame. Te sientes tan bien. </span></em><span>Fuck me. You feel </span><em><span>so good</span></em><span>.” Agatha groans, her forehead coming to rest against Rio’s. She thinks back to the words, the memory sliding down her spine to pool between her legs like a hot iron. Rio thrusts, deep and sure, as she continues. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Te ves tan bonita cuando me comes el coño. Qué buena chica.</span></em><span> You look so pretty when you eat my pussy. Such a good girl.” Rio husks, pressing her palm against the brunette’s clit, matching her undulating hips. She leans forward, letting Agatha’s head drop to her shoulder with a loud moan ringing in her ear. She smirks, pressing a kiss to her neck and licking at her sweat slicked skin like it’s her salvation. The air inside the car is scorching, fogging the windows to conceal them inside like their very own curtain of privacy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>¿Te gusta cuando te hablo en español, chica sucia?” </span></em><span>Rio nips at her skin, groaning softly when Agatha pushes down onto her fingers, “You like it when I talk to you in spanish, dirty girl?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, Rio,” Agatha breathes out softly, fingers digging into anything she can get her hands on, anything to ground her. She is still sensitive, the remnants of her first orgasm barely out of her system before Rio had started touching her. Couple that with the husky voice speaking dirty Spanish in her ear, she’s done for. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Quiero estar dentro de ti cuando te corras.</span></em><span>” Rio husks, sucking at the spot just below her ear and under her jaw, loving the way Agatha’s cunt clenches around her. “I want to be inside of you when you come.” Agatha groans, eyes slamming shut and hips working over time to get across the finish line. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m close - fuck.” Agatha moans. Rio hums. So casually tearing her apart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Diciéndote obscenidades al oído y follándote hasta dejarte sin sentido.</span></em><span>” The brunette gasps, reaching one hand to the wrist thrusting between her thighs with urgency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha whines, all high pitched and needy, just how Rio likes her. Her free hand holds Agatha’s hips still while her other hand thrusts faster, harder, deeper like she knows the captain wants. The brunette lets out an ungodly moan, the hand tangled in dark locks pulling to crush their lips together in a brief, ferocious kiss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me.” Agatha demands.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio nips at her bottom lip, “Speaking filth into your ear and fucking you senseless.” Agatha moans, crushing their lips together, her tongue swiping for entrance and deepening it to taste herself on her tongue. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Ven para mi</span></em><span>,” Rio whispers when Agatha flutters around her fingers. “Come for me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha crumbles, diving head first into her orgasm like a fucking rocket. She’s never felt so alive, every nerve in her system firing, her breath catching and coming out in gasping breaths. Rio is relentless, speaking Spanish and English alike into the catcher's ear as if she could hear a single word she says. Agatha, for once, is blissfully speechless and deaf, the blood rushing in her ears drowning the filth Rio husks to her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s hand, the one still grabbing Rio’s wrist, pushes her hand against her cunt to stop her thrusts. She takes in a long shaky breath and bucks gently into her hand with a soft groan. She’s over stimulated and it feels so damn good. Rio lays back against the seat, eyes watching where her hand disappears between shaking thighs and lets her other hand caress the hot skin beneath her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Enjoy yourself?” Rio questions tauntingly, a smug smile stretched across her lips. Agatha opens her eyes with a weak glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Immensely,” She responds sassily, grinding once more before pulling the pitcher’s hand away. She gathers her wits enough to tease back with a page from the other woman’s book. Bringing Rio’s hand up to her mouth and licking her hand from the heel of her palm to tip of her finger, taking her ring and middle finger into her mouth with a moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Dios mío</span></em><span>,” </span><em><span>My God,</span></em><span> Rio mutters softly, jaw dropping as she watches intensely. The act makes her wonder how long they can stay parked in the back of the lot without being noticed. Agatha hums, clearly pleased by the reaction, and releases Rio’s fingers with a soft pop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And that means?” The brunette prompts expectantly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh,” It takes a second for the raven haired woman to get her brain back. Both hands settle on the catcher’s hips with a gentle squeeze. “My God. </span><em><span>Dios mío</span></em><span>.” Rio answers with a clearer head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And…</span><em><span>mi amor</span></em><span>?” Agatha wonders, trying her hardest to avoid looking the pitcher in the eyes. Rio looks surprised for all of a second before embarrassment colors her cheeks a pretty shade of red. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I, uh, well that means…</span><em><span>my love</span></em><span>.” Rio answers softly, searching Agatha’s face for disgust, fear, annoyance. Anything to clue her in to the brunette’s feelings towards the words. Agatha hums softly, glancing up to see somewhat of an anxious yet hopeful look in dark brown eyes, and feeling her walls crumble that much more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I like it.” Agatha states, soft but confident. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah?” Rio questions, uncertain but feeling her heart jump nearly out of her chest at the admission. The captain suddenly smirks, leaning in for a gentle kiss but grabbing her jaw with a tight grip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Better than </span><em><span>Ags</span></em><span>,” Agatha points out, smiling when Rio rolls her eyes, “if I hear </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> over </span><em><span>mi amor</span></em><span>, I’ll make you regret it. Capiche?” Rio is slightly stunned in awe of those words rolling off of Agatha’s tongue with such ease but she manages to nod her head in agreement. Trying to think of all the ways she can get her to say it again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good.” Agatha pulls up her thong and jeans before climbing back into the passenger seat. She lifts her eyes to the surrounding parking lot, not a concern in the world - until she sees Coach Heart walking right for them. “Oh God. Rio, pull up your fucking pants.” Agatha says quickly, buttoning her jeans and fixing her hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, fuck, fuck-” Rio mutters in complete panic all while trying to desperately pull up her pants and get them fastened again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It smells like sex, the windows make it look like a sauna and my hair looks like I’ve been in a wind tunnel.” Agatha groans bluntly, shooting a blaming glare at her counterpart. “She’s going to know.” Agatha mutters, mostly to herself, as she blasts the A/C with fresh, cold air. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Miss Heart would be the </span><em><span>last</span></em><span> person to figure us out. It could be a lot worse, alright? We’re okay.” Rio attempts to soothe her girlfriend despite her own doubts. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You better be right. I don’t feel like scaring an old woman today.” Agatha hisses with a pointed look filled to the brim with blame. Yeah, okay, it was kind of Rio’s fault for making them pull over but she didn’t tell Agatha to park in the field lot. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You feel like scarring old women on other days?” Rio jabs back swiftly. It earns her a fierce glare that only serves to rile up the butterflies in her chest. Fortunately for the pitcher, Miss Heart is basically knocking on the window so Agatha rolls down the driver’s side window with a plastered smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Miss Heart, what are you still doing here?” Agatha asks with a bit of an edge in her tone but the older woman is none the wiser. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hi girls! Just cleaning up after the game. People can make such a mess. I thought you two would be gone by now? Out celebrating and such.” The older woman says cheerily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, we’ve been celebrating.” Rio mumbles, softly, but not softly enough. Agatha whips her head around with a deadly glare that promises a punishment near death. Is it terrible Rio can’t wait to be on the other end of her wrath? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s that dear?” Miss Heart questions with a blissfully clueless smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll be celebrating tonight.” Agatha reiterates as she flashes her smile back on the older woman. “Speaking of - we should get going.” Agatha and Rio bid the other woman goodbye and drive off toward the dorms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re in trouble.” Agatha glares, half serious, half teasing. Rio rolls her eyes and lets a small twitch of a smirk cross her lips. She can’t wait.</span></p>

<p><span>Rio and Agatha part ways before regrouping with the rest of the team for the many parties they will attend tonight. Being back in the dorm room isn’t exactly what Rio wanted out of the whole ‘weed debacle’ but it was part of getting her scholarship reinstated so she moved some of her things back in. While also keeping a few things at Agatha’s apartment, of course. The brunette had offered her apartment regardless of the woman getting her old dorm room back but they decided not moving in together after only three months was probably a smart choice. Right?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is starting to regret that decision when she opens the door, expecting Rio, only to find her Mother. Her blood runs cold and her stomach twists with that fun tug of anxiety and fear only Evanora Harkness can revoke. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mother? What are you doing here?” Agatha asks, still trying to process the older woman’s sudden arrival. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lovely to see you too, darling daughter of mine.” Evanora greets, swiftly side stepping her daughter to enter the apartment. Agatha’s face twists in complete confusion. </span><em><span>Darling daughter of mine</span></em><span>? Who the fuck says that? Certainly not Evanora Harkness. Agatha shuts the door, maybe a little harder than she intends, and faces her mother with arms crossed protectively over her chest. Whatever Evanora is here for, it isn’t good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It never is, now that Agatha is thinking about it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Normally people </span><em><span>call</span></em><span> before showing up on someone’s doorstep.” Agatha responds tightly. Evanora looks around the apartment with disdain, even though Rio has made it her personal mission to keep the studio clean, and has been successful so far, the disgust is still bright in her cold blue eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, when I own the said doorstep, calling seems a little…” Evanora picks up a worn down sweatshirt, “</span><em><span>Trivial</span></em><span>.” Agatha swallows roughly, her eyes dropping to the sweatshirt just as her mother’s does. Rio’s sweatshirt, one that Agatha decidedly stole once she found out her girlfriend’s scent was ingrained into the material.The sweatshirt is light grey with blood red lettering across the chest of the clothing. The one that reads ‘Eastview Community College’. Yeah, that one, which she so casually tossed over the back of the couch earlier. Pretty fucking hard to miss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha had been so focused on hiding their relationship from the team, from Wanda, that she didn’t prepare for an impromptu haunting of Evanora Harkness at her apartment. The entire studio is covered in signs of Rio Vidal. The thought makes her want to throw up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have something to tell me.” Evanora doesn’t pose it as a question, it’s a statement. Agatha schools her features back into practiced neutrality. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmmm, no, I don’t think so.” Agatha responds calmly. If her voice shakes, her mother doesn’t seem to notice. Evanora drops the sweatshirt and shifts her focus across the apartment. Like an eagle, the older woman starts cataloging every single item that so clearly doesn’t belong to her daughter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s green boxers. A green flannel. More Eastview spiritwear. A botany textbook. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A fucking plant for christ sake. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A small plant but a green one that Agatha hasn’t killed with her black thumb yet. Agatha can’t even remember the name of it. Only that Rio looked so damn adorable carrying it into the apartment with that huge smile on her face. Agatha remembers kissing her because of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It feels like Evanora is looking into her memories when she turns back to Agatha with a piercing look, knowing and devastating. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It wasn’t a question, dear.” Evanora states firmly, moving closer and snagging the eastview sweatshirt off the back of the couch as she stalks closer. </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>. She thrusts the sweatshirt into Agatha’s arms and raises an eyebrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me.” Those two words suddenly sound like a threat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell you wh-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t even think about trying to get out of this, Agatha Harkness. I know everything.” Evanora may as well have slapped her with the amount of venom behind her words. Agatha looks away but suddenly her mother has a grip on her jaw, squeezing her cheeks with pointed nails and jerking mirrored blue eyes back to her own. Agatha feels a rush of fear flood down her spine like ice water but she doesn’t have the heart to back down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sounds like you have your suspicions. Take a guess.” Agatha grits out through clenched teeth, daring the older woman to speak her thoughts into existence. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Pathetic.” Evanora hisses, releasing her daughter’s face with a rough shove and shaking her head in disgust. “If you’re going to disgrace the Harkness name at least take responsibility. You’re lucky I found out when I did. You could’ve destroyed the life I built for you” She shakes her head, waving her off with a scoff. Agatha tosses the sweatshirt onto the couch with a fierce glare and anger brewing in her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lucky? Th-The life you built? Are you joking? I-” Agatha’s anger rises alongside her voice, cutting herself off with a sudden boldness, raising her chin in defiance when her mother’s glare lands on her once again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine. You want to hear it?” Agatha baits, moving closer and matching her mother’s intense stare. Evanora waits, a glint in her eye, thrilled to see her own daughter falling into her line of questioning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sweatshirt belongs to Rio Vidal, </span><em><span>my girlfriend</span></em><span>,” Agatha announces swiftly, proudly, despite the darkening in her mother’s eyes she continues, “She’s been living here for the past month after Wanda tried to destroy her life and got her kicked out of the dorms. That’s where the sweatshirt came from - the plant, the boxers - they’re </span><em><span>hers</span></em><span>. You really don’t want to know what’s in the bedroom.” Agatha laughs, knowing for a fact that their box of toys would give her mother a heart attack. </span><em><span>On second thought…</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are truly an imbecile,” Evanora hisses, “Do you have any idea what this kind of scandal would do to our family-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t make me laugh, mother. You’re worried about the company - nothing more, nothing less. Certainly not me, your own daughter - </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> happiness. </span><em><span>Please.</span></em><span>” Agatha cuts her off, refusing to hear the lie. Evanora laughs, fucking laughs, right in her face as an evil smile stretches across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The company- </span><em><span>My company</span></em><span>, is what gives you the life you have and I will be damned if you squander it with these impuissant feelings of </span><em><span>happiness</span></em><span>.” Evanora comes to stand within inches of her daughter, blue eyes staring like daggers into the clone of them. “Harkness Energy is your future. Success is your future. Happiness, your feelings, and the pathetic company you decide to keep is nothing but a road block keeping you from what you were </span><em><span>made</span></em> <em><span>for</span></em><span>.” Evanora spits, disgust and disappointment clear and present in every word.</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Made for</span></em><span>. Ever since she was born Agatha knew her one and only purpose in her mother’s eyes was to take over the family business. Except Agatha didn’t turn into the mini-Evanora the woman had hoped for. Instead, she became the exact opposite, and drove Evanora mad every day thereafter. Agatha feels her blood boil, fury and defiance rising like a tidal wave, ready to crash down on her with a destructive wrath.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll be sure to remind you of that when I destroy your precious little bartender under my heel.” Evanora speaks the words so smoothly, so soft, but just as cutting. Agatha’s bravado crumples under the weight of her mother’s words, heart dropping into her stomach like a brick. The tidal wave of anger inside of her dissipates in seconds. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” She utters softly, brow furrowing in confusion and concern as her gut once again twists with fear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not an idiot, Agatha.” Evanora sighs with a shake of her head, perpetually disappointed by her daughter. She crosses her arms and studies her daughter with a sharp gaze. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are stubborn, something you got from me, unfortunately. Though it seems like it may be the </span><em><span>only</span></em><span> trait you inherited.” Evanora huffs. “Either way, I won’t get anywhere with you but your </span><em><span>friend</span></em><span>…” Evanora chuckles lightly, enjoying the way her daughter’s face drops at the implication.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, yes. Your precious </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> will be </span><em><span>nothing</span></em><span> once I am done with her. No scholarship, no team, no future. I may even debate taking her home if you make things especially difficult for me.” The older woman begins examining her manicure as if making threats is just another Tuesday. Maybe it is. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Agatha states strongly, tries to at least, but her voice waivers with emotion. Would she follow through? Would Evanora take everything Rio has worked so hard for - and more? Gabriella’s house, Rio’s childhood, their safety crushed in one fell swoop all because of Agatha? She can’t let that happen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>.” Evanora hissed, light flying in her eyes at the defiance, “I won’t let </span><em><span>my daughter</span></em><span>, the heiress to the Harkness fortune, become anything but a woman of power.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can - I can do that. I can be who you need me to be without you hurting Rio.” Agatha insists but the older woman isn’t buying it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t want to hurt the poor girl. She’s been through enough in her young life.” Evanora actually sounds empathetic if it weren’t for Agatha’s extensive knowledge of her mother’s inability to have feelings. “I want my daughter to be the picture perfect rising CEO I have raised her to be. Do you think that includes a </span><em><span>painfully </span></em><span>sarcastic, </span><em><span>plant</span></em><span> major, with a history of </span><em><span>drug dealing </span></em><span>hanging from your arm?” An indignant scoff. “A </span><em><span>woman</span></em><span>, no less.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans in frustration. “She didn’t- She isn’t a drug dealer! Wanda planted that evidence on her.” Agatha hisses, her anger flaring once again as she picks apart the weakest part of her mother's argument. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, darling, that simply won’t matter. Not to the media.” Evanora begins stalking closer, a deadly gleam in her eye, “She will be labeled a drug dealer who grows weed in her dorm room provided by the state through her scholarship. The headline alone - </span><em><span>Tax Payer Money Hard At Work Creating the Criminals of the Future</span></em><span>.” She laughs, a deep cackle, a sound terrifyingly similar to an evil witch, as if the faux headline is hilarious. Agatha might be sick. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not a good look, Agatha, and it's only made worse by the fact you used the company lawyer to get her out of it.” An eye roll and disdainful shake of her head makes her look exhausted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha swallows the fear and panic in her throat. “You know about that?” Agatha whispers, trying hard to hide how much her voice shakes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stark has been on my well endowed payroll long before you came into the picture. Did you really think he was keeping your little secrets?” Evanora raises an eyebrow. Agatha’s jaw clenches and she feels pain zip through her from the tightness of her muscles. A headache begins crawling up her brain stem. Agatha closes her eyes and pinches the bridge of her nose, breathing deeply. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you want me to do, Mother?” Her voice is nothing but a strained whisper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dump her.” Evanora says simply, glancing down to admire her perfectly manicured nails once again as if she is becoming bored with the conversation, meeting her daughter’s incredulous blue eyes with a stern look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>What?</span></em><span>” Agatha hisses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You heard me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We can keep our relationship quiet. No one will know-” Agatha tries to compromise, belatedly wondering how she will sell it to Rio, a life of secrecy, but it will be worth it if they’re together - </span><em><span>right?</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Remind me, Agatha, how long this </span><em><span>relationship</span></em><span> of yours stayed ‘quiet’ even in your little neanderthal squad?” Evanora questions knowingly, pinning her daughter with a look of exhaustion. Agatha opens her mouth but finds herself unable to speak. It makes the older woman smirk triumphantly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Three months.” Evanora answers herself, slowly moving closer toward her daughter, “Celebrities being followed by paparazzi in Hollywood hide their affairs better than you.” Another thing Agatha has failed at. Because that is all she is to her mother - a failure. She snaps her jaw closed, clenching her teeth together and willing the tears away. She knows what is coming. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Break up with her,” Evanora says softly but sharply, keeping their eyes locked, “Make it…rememberable. I don’t want to see her again. I don’t want to hear her name. I don’t want to </span><em><span>think</span></em><span> of this woman. If I do…” Agatha tears her eyes away as the tears start to surface. Evanora hums softly, a noise of disappointment at the show of weakness, before making her way back toward the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know what I am capable of, Agatha. Don’t make me show Rio what that means.” A threat, clear and simple. Break up with Rio or Evanora will do it for her. The door closes after Evanora’s departure and the first tear streaks down her cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Thirty minutes pass. Agatha wipes her tears and tries to brainstorm a solution, anything that will keep Rio in her life without ruining her. Secret girlfriends perhaps? A fake break up? She even considers faking her own death. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When she comes up with nothing she has no choice but to plan for the alternative. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When there is a knock at her door and Rio is finally on the other side of it she feels nothing but dread and the cold exterior she has practiced for most of her life falls into place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus,” Rio breathes out, looking down the brunette’s body to admire the rich purple halter top dress and elegant black heels, “You look gorgeous.” Her words are soft and reverent, her smile widening before it drops at the sight of Agatha’s cold eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s wrong?” Rio is immediately concerned, stepping into the apartment with her hands reaching out to her girlfriend. Agatha redirects her touch, tugging her gently inside and shutting the door. Ignoring the fact that Rio looks so good in her black jeans, band t-shirt and blazer with her silky dark hair pulled back into a sleek bun. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We need to talk.” Agatha doesn’t even recognize her own voice. Rio thinks she knows what this is about and sighs softly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I know. The team knows about us now but the only one giving us shit is Jen. Everyone else is too scared of you to do any-” Rio begins but Agatha cuts her off.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not - well, yes, that is a problem but that’s not what we need to talk about.” Agatha breathes out, trying to focus. She adverts her eyes for the next sentence because she won’t be able to look into her eyes </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> make this hurt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’re done.” Two words, a collection of painful letters, each thrown like daggers into Rio’s chest while slicing Agatha all the same. Rio obviously doesn’t hear her correctly. A long pause fills with shocked silence.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very funny.” Rio huffs out a soft laugh, a small smile crossing her lips because humor is a great way to deflect whatever this is. Agatha doesn’t laugh, doesn’t smile, doesn’t even spare Rio a glance as she begins walking away to gather things throughout the apartment. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Is she joking?</span></em><span> Rio can’t think of a single reason Agatha would so suddenly and coldly end their relationship. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, you can’t be serious.” Rio begins slowly as her heart rate picks up, brow furrowing in utter confusion. Agatha feels her stomach twist sickly, threatening an upheaval, her body revolting against her own words. A cold sweat covers the back of her neck and her hands begin to shake. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m completely serious.” Agatha says strongly, tossing the collected items into a bag, all of Rio’s things. The sweatshirt, boxers and books. “I didn’t want to do this before the championship game and mess with the team dynamics before the big game.” She drops the bag of items at the pitcher’s feet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, Agatha. What are you even saying right now? Everything has been fine. We’re good. No one on the team is going to talk.” Rio says softly, the desperation in her voice breaking through when the brunette continues to avoid her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This really isn’t up for debate, Rio. I’m done. We’re done.” Agatha’s voice is deceivingly strong as she walks toward the door, reaching to open it only for a palm to slam it back into place. The shock of the act finally has blue eyes snapping to brown. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Pain, disbelief, and anger swirling in her brown eyes like the eye of a hurricane. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>We’re done.</span></em><span> That’s it? After everything we’ve been through to get here and that’s how you end us?” Rio hisses, eyes narrowed and furious, not believing her ears. “Tell me why, Agatha.” The brunette looks away, the pain in brown eyes too startling - too real, that her resolve begins to waiver the longer she looks into them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look me in the eyes.” Rio demands swiftly. Agatha takes a second, just long enough to remind herself what her mother will do if she doesn’t make this a painfully, memorable moment. If she doesn’t tear Rio apart then her mother will and somehow this seems merciful to Rio. Not to Agatha. God, no, she feels like she’s lighting herself on fire and begging for more gasoline but doing this keeps Rio away from the fire. So, she looks into Rio’s eyes with the facade of the Westview Witch enveloping her very being. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her mother would be proud. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not a </span><em><span>lesbian</span></em><span>.” Agatha bites out swiftly, the first crack in Rio’s big furious eyes begins quickly, fading into something softer - something pained, “I told you what my life looked like. Successful CEO with a picture perfect family - a </span><em><span>husband</span></em><span> at my side. Did you really think you would be in it?” She forces out a chuckle, an indignant little noise to shove the metaphorical knife deeper into Rio’s heart, and watches her face fall with disbelieving shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought…” Rio hesitates, stutters at the alarmingly cold eyes staring back at her, unrecognizable. Agatha takes up the loss of words to fill with her own brutality, the final nail in the coffin of their relationship. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feigns an empathetic pout, “You thought…What? Because you know how to fuck me I’d keep you around?” Rio’s lips part, another slap to the face, another knife in her chest, another crack in her defiance to make this work, leaves her speechless. Agatha reaches out to brush a rogue lock of raven hair behind her ear. Rio flinches and Agatha feels like a black hole is swallowing her heart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>That must be where her mother’s heart is - the abyss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Sweetheart</span></em><span>, I went years without sexual gratification. I’ll survive the rest of my life with mediocre sex and my own hands to get me through the night.” The nickname, the disrespect, the lack of emotion. </span><em><span>Who is she?</span></em><span>  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We were more than that.” Rio grits out softly, swallowing the emotions building in her throat. She spots the small twitch in Agatha’s eye, it gives her some hope, for a second, before the brunette laughs again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More than sex?” Agatha wonders aloud, a cruel smile spreading across her lips. “Rio, that’s how we started. We nearly tore each other’s throats out before we started fucking. I’m not sure why you would think we were anything else.” So, she has resorted to gaslighting now. She’s vaguely familiar with the concept considering her mother does it quite often. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You asked me to be your fucking girlfriend - that’s why!” Rio growls. Agatha has the audacity to roll her eyes. It gives her a few seconds to think of a response because, as always, Rio is incredibly witty and collected even when she looks like she is about to rip her hair out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I will admit that was a lapse in judgment. I should’ve known you were the clingy type.” A disappointed sigh that sounds so terrifyingly close to the one her mother did, leaves her. “I was lonely and Ralph was busy with his freshman fan club. How else was I supposed to fill my time? Use a vibrator?” Agatha poses the question as if it was an obvious observation - as if Rio should’ve expected her to </span><em><span>use</span></em><span> her to fill her time. Rio’s teeth smash together, pain lighting through her jaw and her nostrils flaring in anger.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You met my abuelita.” Rio whispers, dark and dangerous, and finally more angry than devastated. Agatha opens her mouth, trying to desperately think of a witty response but she can’t. She won’t. Gabriella is off limits because no matter what she says or does that woman will always have a special place in her heart. Just like Rio. She pushes back the emotions begging to erupt from her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was your decision, Rio. I didn’t ask for that.” Agatha states simply, avoiding her eyes once again to tuck strands of hair behind her ears. Rio releases a huff of breath, disbelief, shaking her head. She pulls her once determined and strong hand away from the door. Agatha feels her heart break at the sight but she pushes through. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ralph should be here any minute,” Agatha pulls the door open and looks towards the opening, “I’ll see you around, Vidal.” Rio clenches her jaw and turns away, hesitating for a second but her brain is filled with nothing but static, tears burning behind her eyes and emotions choking her words. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pushes through the doorway and leaves the apartment building in search of something to preoccupy her mind. Something to make her numb. She reads Alice’s text summoning her to one of the many parties the women will attend tonight and makes a beeline through the crowd straight for the bar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio! Come dance with us!” Darcy calls out as soon as she spots the pitcher, wildly waving her arms as she dances beside Dottie and Maria. Rio takes one shot, then another. The burn of alcohol both feeds and quells the anger inside of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Easy tiger. We’ve got all night.” Jen chuckles, watching the near ravenous woman slam back three shots of-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jesus. Is that Tequila?” Alice mutters into her cup, brow furrowed in concern as she watches alongside the first baseman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s going to regret that in the morning.” Jen nods her head, wincing as the third shot glass is slammed down onto the table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, honey, is everything okay?” Lilia questions curiously, moving closer to the pitcher and placing a calming hand on her arm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yep, all good.” Rio dismisses her concerns quickly, “What are you drinking?” She asks while swiping Alice’s drink straight from her hands and wincing at the vodka cranberry mixture sliding across her tongue. </span><em><span>Fucking Agatha. </span></em><span>Why does </span><em><span>everything</span></em><span> remind her of that woman?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh - uh, cranberry vod- you know that already.” Alice huffs with a frown. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey,” Jen steps in to take the now empty cup from Rio with a stern look, “Have some manners, Vidal.” She hands Alice her cup and fixes the pitcher with a concerned look. This is nothing like Rio and they can all see it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking Vodka cranberry - </span><em><span>Jesus Christ</span></em><span>. Sorry, sorry.” Rio apologizes quickly, already feeling the liquor working through her system and snagging the bottle of whiskey from the counter. “Are you guys gonna come dance?” She questions as she begins walking towards the bouncing group of women. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia is stuck still trying to calculate the amount of shots Rio took to get the probability of alcohol poisoning in such a small woman. Alice is scanning the makeshift bar to remake her drink while sending a glare toward the retreating pitcher. Jen is studying the woman, always watching, noticing how the normal teasing glint in her eyes is dull, and wonders where the other half of the duo is. Her questions are answered soon enough. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Not long after Rio’s sudden departure to the dance floor Agatha waltzes in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Hanging off of Ralph’s arm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, you’ve got to be joking. What the fuck is she doing?” Jen is the first one to spot their catcher, Lilia and Alice quickly following her eyes to the problem of the night. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um, did I hallucinate when Rio and Agatha all but screamed about their relationship at the game today?” Alice asks more for her own sanity than anything else, looking into her cup at the offending red liquid and wonders if she’s already drunk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That poor girl,” Lilia mutters under her breath, her heartbreak for the young woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No wonder Rio is trying to drown herself in tequila.” Jen hisses, understanding better than most the sting of your ex-girlfriend fleeing back to hetero-normalcy. Agatha walks towards the group, her jaw muscles twitching when Ralph’s hand slides over her ass, her eyes scanning the crowd for a specific head of raven hair only to be met with three furious team mates. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey ladies,” Ralph says smugly, seemingly unbothered when none of them respond with anything more than a mutter and a glare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When did this happen?” Jen asks sharply, waving her hand between the reconnected couple. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha just can’t stay away from me.” Ralph interjects swiftly, earning a glare from Agatha, his face falling swiftly. “I’m gonna get us some drinks.” The man leaves and without his idiotic behavior to keep any words at bay, the three women pounce for more information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the fuck Agatha?” Jen asks incredulously, a stern glare falling on the brunette.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did you do?” Alice wonders suspiciously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When did the puppy get back in the picture?” Lila huffs, already frustrated. Agatha, having refused to drop the Westview Witch persona, responds easily, coldly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know what the three of you are prattling on about.” Agatha bites quickly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know if you’ve realized, but you have a man clinging to you like a newborn baby.” Jen responds back, her disgust obvious. Agatha rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re always so dramatic.” Agatha dismisses. Jen is going to pull her hair out. </span><em><span>Oh wait-</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, you can’t possibly expect us not to question the current situation considering you were together with </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> two seconds ago.” Lilia is calm, unimpressed and so disappointed. Agatha feels her chest twinge sharply at the reminder of the pitcher. Not that she’s forgotten - God, she wishes she could - but at the very least she had been able to disassociate herself from the thought of Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know what,” Agatha begins softly, feigning understanding and thoughtfulness, putting on a sweet smile, “I </span><em><span>expect</span></em><span> you to mind your business. Okay?” Her tone is sharp, refusing to bend - not now, not with these three. They don’t know what they’re talking about and she’s not planning on filling them in.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wow. You are really playing into the Westview </span><em><span>Bitch</span></em><span> act, aren’t you Agatha?” Jen huffs snarkily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha lets out a mocking laugh, “</span><em><span>Ha ha</span></em><span>. Good one, Kale.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We will not mind our business!” Lilia replies angrily, having just enough alcohol in her system to be a little sassy and not give a shit about the trouble it will get her in, “Not when Rio is trying to waterboard herself with Tequila and Whiskey!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha has a retort ready to go, even parted her lips to say something about Lilia’s wacky nature, but the comment about Rio throws her off. It takes two seconds for her to spot Rio in the bustling crowd on the dance floor. A bottle of whiskey, half full and tilted completely upside down to empty into her waiting mouth. Women she doesn’t recognize begin to encircle her like vultures, ready to feast on the vulnerable heartbroken woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The guilt and longing hit her like a truck, right in the chest, forcing the air from her lungs. It’s pathetic how close she is to dragging the pitcher away and begging her to take care of herself. That it isn’t her fault but Agatha’s. This is her fault - </span><em><span>her mess</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>And yet, it doesn’t matter, because no matter how terrible Agatha feels - how lonely, guilty and heartbroken - Rio comes first. Because she hasn’t done anything wrong. She studies hard and plays softball like a badass and connects with everyone she meets because she is amazing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio deserves the world and Agatha can’t even give her a sliver of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t deserve her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“W-What do you want me to do about it?” Agatha starts off softly and stuttering, the emotions catching in her chest, before she reigns herself in. Just like Jen said, the Westview </span><em><span>Bitch</span></em><span> act settled into place with a terrifying amount of ease. She looks at the three women expectantly but each of them are too stunned to speak. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph returns with a cup of something, most likely a vodka cranberry with a heavy pour, if she’s lucky, and Agatha chugs it while dragging him away to the opposite side of the house. Anything to get away from Rio and her dancing women. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay, we need to fix this,” Lilia says definitively, a sure nod of her head to accompany the decision. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, no. No, I don’t </span><em><span>meddle</span></em><span>. I gossip.” Jen is shaking her head as soon as the woman starts speaking. Alice nudges her with her elbow and an oddly endearing disappointed frown on her face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What about Darcy and Dottie?” Alice questioned, already knowing how easy it was for the first baseman to “highly suggest” their connection - to their faces. Jen releases a reluctant sigh and narrows her eyes slightly at the shorter woman. Alice simply smiles smugly in return. Jen likes seeing her smile. </span><em><span>Oh, interesting</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine. What do you want me to do?” Jen asks Lilia. The older woman thinks for a few seconds, tapping a perfectly painted nail on her bottom lip as she decides. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You and I will go talk to Agatha. She’s obviously lost her sense and taste.” Lilia turns to the second baseman, “Alice, you’ll make sure Rio doesn’t get alcohol poisoning.” Alice frowns slightly but agrees, turning her attention to the pitcher who is still sipping on the bottle of whiskey. A sigh escapes her but she makes her way towards the dance floor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia and Jen find Agatha perched on top of Ralph’s lap on the couch in the living room. Jen, not one to pretend she likes people, doesn’t bother so much as glance at Ralph before yanking the brunette from his lap. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wh- Hey! Jen!” Agatha gasps out, trying to pull out of Jen’s surprisingly strong grip. The first baseman drags the brunette out onto the back porch before finally releasing her. Lilia is close behind. The bumping music of the party is muffled through the sliding glass door, the silence deafening. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did you do, Harkness?” Jen asks sternly, crossing her arms and narrowing her gaze on the other woman. Agatha groans, wishing she had more vodka in her cup. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why are you assuming </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> did something?” Agatha demands in a lame rebuttal. Jen and Lila aren’t buying it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>always</span></em><span> do something!” Lilia points out emphatically. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not true!” Agatha defends, knowing it’s weak. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, it is.” Jen retorts swiftly, “You did something and I know you did something because I have seen the way Rio looks at you. Like you hung the stars in the damn sky or something. She’d probably even murder someone if they tried to say otherwise. You get where I’m going with this?” Agatha feels herself floundering, mouth opening and closing with a huff of frustration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What in the world are you talking about?” Agatha grits out, already planning her escape from this conversation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She has feelings for you, Agatha. Deep, meaningful feelings that you have so obviously crushed. So, what did you do? Because you need to take it back and make things right.” Lilia lays out their words as plainly as she can without saying it so directly. God knows “love bombing” Agatha Harkness in someone else’s name may lead to a complete nuclear meltdown. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Take it back. Make things right.</span></em><span> Agatha could laugh at the absurdity of it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> don’t know what you’re talking about.” Agatha hisses, trying to move past the two women only for Jen to step into her escape route. She huffs and glares, meeting her eyes with a furious look. Jen is decidedly unbothered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We do.” No nonsense. Agatha groans in frustration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t- trust me. If you did, you wouldn’t be suggesting I could fix whatever it is we had. It’s done and she’s better for it.” She finally pushes past Jen but Lilia doesn’t let her escape so easily. She’s going to lose her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Drinking herself to liver failure is better for her?” Lilia asks genuinely, becoming a little more suspicious of her captain who sounds more concerned than they initially thought. Agatha sighs softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, obviously not.” Agatha breathes out, hating the heavy weight of feelings settling in her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t want to be with her - that's fine. It's your choice.” Lilia says softer now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A stupid choice because Ralph is-” Jen begins strongly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It is your choice Agatha.” Lilia repeats with a stern look toward the first baseman, “But whatever happened between you two is actively eating Rio alive. So, please, talk to her. Make her understand that even though she isn’t your choice, one day she will be someone else's.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hates that. Hates that Rio will never be hers. She wants to choose her and she does, in her mind. Envisions a life full of rants about plants, mouth watering food, ridiculously sarcastic remarks and mind blowing orgasms. She doesn’t just want it - she needs it. But more than that, she needs Rio to keep the life she has earned. If that means Agatha lives a life under her mother’s thumb, bound to a loveless marriage, and stewing in regret and longing until she dies then so be it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I can’t.” Agatha whispers, pain radiating through her body like a sucker punch to the gut. She pushes past the two women and walks back into the house in search of her own way to drown her thoughts in alcohol. Vodka is a fantastic choice for self-inflicted poisoning. She grabs the whole bottle, copying her secret ex-girlfriend, and searches for a quiet place to </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> think. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give it back, Alice.” Rio huffs, her head in the clouds and searching for the bottle that was so rudely snatched from her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not a chance. I’m saving your liver. You’ll thank me later.” Alice takes a sip from the bottle before wincing at the taste. Whiskey was never her go-to. Rio tries to stand up from the chair the second baseman all but threw her into but struggles to use her legs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, at least you made more progress than us.” Jen grumbles, swiping the bottle of whiskey from Alice’s hand to take her own sip. Rio frowns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s too stubborn for her own good.” Alice mutters, watching Lilia take the offered bottle for her own swig of liquor. Rio huffs and reaches out for the bottle, nearly succeeding in taking it, just as Alice swipes it out of her reach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s being an idiot on so many levels.” Jen hisses, regarding Rio who groans in frustration but finally gives up her effort for more alcohol. It’s not like Agatha is doing this to some random person - it’s Rio, their teammate. And somehow she still couldn’t give a damn. What happened to the woman who nearly bitch slapped Wanda for laying a hand on Rio? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There has to be a good reason. Agatha is a bitch but she isn’t heartless. We’ve all seen it.” Lilia takes her second sip of whiskey with a shake of her head. They have, every single one of them sees the obvious head over heel affection Rio has for the catcher but Agatha is more subtle. The way she studies the pitcher, the softness of her voice, the little glint in her eyes lighting up at the sight of the raven haired woman. It’s easy to miss but the trio has grown to know their captain’s quirks and tells. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, if you’re going to talk about </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> then at least let me drink.” Rio groans, easily taking the bottle from Lilia before Alice snatches it away, not a single drop reaches her tongue. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why did she end things between you two?” Jen asks curiously, wondering if Rio has any insight. The raven haired woman huffs angrily and reaches for the bottle. It gets tugged out of her reach. Jen takes the bottle from Alice, still keeping it out of reach but waiting expectantly for Rio’s answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What does it matter?” Rio hisses, feeling the anger flare inside of her chest as she lunges for the bottle. Alice keeps her steadily in the chair with a hand on her shoulder. Jen stands strong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She says she’s not a lesbian - that all we had was sex and she needs a dick by her side.” Thankfully the details of their conversation are fuzzy from all the alcohol in her system, despite being ingrained in her mind for life. She shakes her head, making herself dizzier. The three women look at her in confusion. “I don’t know - ask her!” She spits out quickly, snagging the bottle from Jen’s hand and managing to take one more sip of whiskey. Lilia had snatched it away this time. Rio remembers being faster than all of them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Needs a dick by her side?</span></em><span>” Alice repeated slowly, trying very hard not to laugh while simultaneously figuring out the drunken coded message in Rio’s mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s not the type to care what people think.” Lilia mutters thoughtfully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her mother?” Jen offers softly, continuing when the two women look at her in confusion, “Harkness Energy is a energy fucking conglomerate on the East Coast. Agatha is the heiress to the business - it’s her major for god sakes. Maybe it’s not her choice to ‘</span><em><span>need a dick by her side</span></em><span>’?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio really wishes they would just hand over the bottle of whiskey. Maybe that will turn off her ears. She’s sick of hearing about Agatha. She needs to stop the entire conversation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She met my abuelita.” Rio adds swiftly, taking the bottle back with a daring glare towards the three women, “Then told me I was nothing more than a glorified vibrator. You think that was her mother’s doing?” Rio whispers bitterly, reveling in the burn of whiskey sliding down her throat. Nothing but silence follows. That’s much better. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” Alice grumbles with a grimace. Something like that would break anyone. None of the women can even imagine being on the other end of that line. They share a look - understanding and sympathy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pushes out of the chair without anyone to stop her and walks away from the women content with discussing the current reason Rio has a knife in her heart - she’ll pass on that conversation. She stumbles up the stairs, searching for a bathroom to hide in until the trio leaves her alone long enough to score more liquor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She begins pushing into a bathroom that has a few women filing out of it, grumbling something about a bitch - or a witch. Rio supposes it could be either one. Of course when she steps into the bathroom and the door closes behind her, the latter name sounds more likely. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha Harkness sits on the bathroom sink, the neck of a bottle of vodka gripped tightly in her grasp as she takes another shot of the clear liquor. The closing of the door brings Rio’s presence to the brunette’s attention. Her cold eyes flash briefly in pain and dread before solidifying once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get out, Vidal.” Agatha rasps out softly. Rio scoffs, briefly wonders if this is a figment of her imagination due to the alcohol. Of course the captain looks amazing, dressed in a tight black dress, her hair flowing freely over her shoulders in waves, smokey make-up bringing out the frigid ice in her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You get out. You’re not even using the bathroom.” Rio bites back, all the venom in her chest filling her words. Agatha has the audacity to roll her eyes like she doesn’t feel the venom leeching into her veins. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was here first.” Agatha retaliates, her eyes locked on the bottle of vodka as she wonders how quickly she could finish the bottle. Rio huffs, refusing to leave but reluctant to stay. She closes the distance between them, startling Agatha from her staring contest with the vodka bottle, and swiping the said bottle from her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey!” Agatha frowns and glares at the raven haired woman who takes a shot of vodka. The liquor drips down Rio’s chin when she pulls the bottle away, wincing at the harsh taste and grimacing as the liquor pours down her throat. Agatha feels a sudden, familiar tug in her gut, watching the pitcher’s mouth when her tongue swipes out to collect the escaping liquid. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stop,” Rio hisses, already recognizing the growing heat in blue eyes that are still somehow so cold. Agatha’s eyes jump up to meet Rio’s. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stop what?” She huffs, feigning innocence and dropping her eyes back to watch her lips. They’re really nice. Like the best. Agatha can’t remember their last kiss. Was it when Rio left her apartment last? Just before her mother showed up with a wrecking ball personally dedicated to ruining Agatha’s dreams and aspirations. That sounds right. Hardly a memorable kiss. They should rectify that, shouldn’t they?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Looking at me like </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>.” Rio says pointedly, taking another swig of vodka with less of a grimace. It’s as if Agatha staring at her lips flips a switch, a flush daring to climb up her neck with the lust flaring through her system. She’s pathetic. Even still, she lets her own eyes drop to Agatha’s lips, painted in red lipstick similar to the shade she wore when they first kissed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>In a bathroom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>At a party. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It’s ironic that they’re so close to being in that same position again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Except now, they know exactly how the other feels coming undone. How tight muscles squeeze, their moans sound breathless right at the edge and their names taste on each other's tongues. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Like what?</span></em><span>” Agatha says the words slowly, effortlessly seductive, making sure to smirk just enough to pull Rio’s eyes back up to her own. She’s baiting her, Rio knows that, but that used to be one of her favorite past times - falling into the captain’s traps. She’ll walk right into it but that doesn’t mean she’ll make it easy. She hands the bottle back to the brunette and shifts closer, standing right in front of Agatha’s closed legs, placing a hand on the counter by her hip to lean in closer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like you want to know what my lips taste like with vodka.” Rio husks, a smirk stretching across her lips. Agatha </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> wondering that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmm, I can’t look at you like that?” Agatha whispers back, like it’s a secret, leaning forward to tempt the pitcher. Rio scoffs softly, matching the brunette’s advancement inch for inch, her other hand coming to the counter to bracket Agatha’s body fully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No,” Rio says decidedly swift, making Agatha’s confidence waver for only a second before she continues, “Not unless you’re going to do something about it.” Agatha smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio loves it. Loves he-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She leans in closer, watches those painfully frigid eyes flutter closed as their lips come within seconds of pressing together. “But I wouldn’t want to ruin your future life plans, Harkness.” She pulls away, takes half a step back, truly smug about fucking with the Witch of Westview. She even manages to keep the pain out of her words. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes fly open. A mixture of her icy nature, warmth from the alcohol, and the rage from Rio’s taunting words. She doesn’t let Rio get far. She needs to kiss her like she needs oxygen and she won’t be leaving this bathroom without it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha reaches out, gripping Rio’s t-shirt in her fist and tugging her forward without hesitation. Rio lets out a soft, surprised grunt at the aggression, her eyes slipping closed on instinct. Their lips slam together in a rush of hunger and lust, tongues demanding entrance and teeth daring to get into the mix. It’s just like before - consuming each other with every breath, kiss, touch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels like she’s falling and doesn’t own a parachute. She briefly wonders if this will be the rest of her life. Pining after a woman set on a path that doesn’t include her. The thought quickly leaves her mind when teeth abuse her bottom lip, drawing a moan from her throat. She pushes forward, parting Agatha’s thighs to plant herself between them and bringing her hands to her hips and squeezes with the belated thought of leaving bruises. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Bruises for </span><em><span>Ralph</span></em><span> to find. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A renewed desire to make Agatha remember her, not just tonight but for the rest of her life, consumes every inch of her being. Rio jerks her closer to the edge of the counter, pushing her dress up, nearly ripping the material to get it past her ass. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Careful!” Agatha hisses, shifting in her spot to allow the dress to slip over her ass easier, “This dress is expensive. A designer-” Lucious lips effectively cut her off, a tongue slipping past her lips to pull out a moan instead of more words. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know what?” Rio whispers, her fingers slipping beneath the ungodly, flimsy material of a purple lace thong as she speaks, “I’ve realized I give so much less of a </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> about what you wear when I plan on taking it off of you.”  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A swift, strong pull leaves the thong under her fingers pointless scraps of lace. Agatha gasps at the audible rip that sounds through the bathroom. She hates and loves how easy it was for Rio to tear it off of her. She loves the way she’s unapologetically smug at the move, tossing the scraps of material to the floor. The heat between her thighs is scorching hot begging for attention and nothing that happens, or has happened between them, will stop Rio from fulfilling the silent request. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That doesn’t mean you can-” Agatha attempts to keep her edge, ready to fight the pitcher despite spreading her legs to tempt her closer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It does,” Rio bites out strongly, both hands skating up her warm thighs and squeezing possessively as her eyes feast on the gorgeous woman in front of her. She is dripping, aching for more, they both know Rio can give it to her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It means I can rip off your slutty little panties,” Rio husks, one hand reaching up to slide into Agatha’s wild hair and grips tightly to keep their eyes locked, extracting a soft gasp and heat in blue eyes. “And slide my fingers inside your pretty wet pussy.” Her fingers venture north, feeling slick heat touch her finger tips well before she reaches the source, and loving the knowledge that it is because of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha swallows roughly, lips parting to fire back but only able to force herself to breathe through the moan begging to climb out of her throat. Finger tips graze her clit, a moan leaving her anyway, her eyes dropping low to watch. “Fuck, Rio.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you won’t do a damn thing besides watch,” Rio hisses, choking back her own moan as two fingers slide into Agatha’s cunt. Agatha doesn’t bother holding back her passion. Rio knows how good she is at fucking her. They’ve certainly done this enough for Rio to know Agatha would be holding back if she only made a handful of noises. A guttural moan leaves her lips, eyelids fluttering closed and hands tightening in fists on Rio’s t-shirt, pressing into the heated skin of her stomach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck - </span><em><span>Oh, fuck</span></em><span>.” Rio’s fingers feel as good as ever. This time, Agatha forces herself to memorize every sweet touch like it’s the last - pushing the reality of that statement to the back of her mind to enjoy this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Watch,</span></em><span>” Rio orders, tightening her grip in brown locks with a gentle tug, waiting to see blue eyes. Agatha groans softly, a small protest to the other woman’s demands but opens her eyes again. The sight of Rio staring at her with nothing but heat sends a shiver down her spine. Either from the lust in her eyes or the lack of emotion - she’s not sure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“God, you look so desperate.” Rio whispers, smug, curling her fingers to pull a whine from the brunette. Effectively cutting off any smart mouthed retort. “Agatha Harkness, desperate. It’s a good look on you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everything looks good on me - </span><em><span>shit</span></em><span>.” Agatha gasps, lurching forward, bucking into Rio’s hand to feel her palm graze her clit. It feels so good. Despite her witty comeback, the subsequent moan that followed kind of cuts the sharpness of her words. Rio smirks.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I bet you’re aching for three fingers, aren’t you?” A wave of lust nearly crushes Agatha, takes the breath from her lungs before a deep moan fills the space between them. It tells enough, even if she refuses to use her words, a flush working over her chest. She moans again, right alongside the obscene sounds of her arousal coating Rio’s fingers - three of them now - with every thrust. She still wants more, a lot of it she can’t even speak aloud. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio pushes closer, forcing an awkward angle into her hand but keeping up the pace with three fingers. The leverage forces her fingers deeper, her other hand forcing Agatha’s head to tilt back, lips brushing Agatha’s as she pants for breath and lets out sweet moans. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, that’s not it,” Rio whispers almost conversationally, nipping at her bottom lip and smiling as the brunette chases her kiss, “You always loved my strap on. You look so good when you take it.” Her voice drips with lust, her eyes dark and far away to imagine the last time they used the strap on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha might combust because, yeah, that is exactly what she wants. Rio’s strap on filling her up while her hands are free to roam and her lips stay busy marking her skin. The pitcher's strong hands gripping her hips so hard to leave fingertip bruises deep in her skin as she is thrust back onto the strap on with deep, meaningful pumps of steady hips. She feels herself squeezing around the fingers inside of her. She knows the raven haired woman knows what she's thinking about because the pitcher smirks and curls her fingers into the sweet spot she's been teasing. Agatha nearly whines, her head threatening to drop forward if it wasn’t for the hand in her hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She tries to speak, “Rio, I- </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span> - I need-” She needs something to touch her clit. Rio’s hand, her own, she’ll take what she can get. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t let her finish, “You’re very needy.” She agrees swiftly, knowing </span><em><span>exactly</span></em><span> what the brunette needs to get off and doing everything </span><em><span>but</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t fucking tease,” Agatha hisses, bucking her hips to grind her clit into the pitcher’s palm. The woman appeases her, for a few seconds, offering her hand to grind against. Then as if taking those words as a challenge, Rio pulls out her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why not? Do you have somewhere to be?” Rio asks, a knowing smile on her lips and a little tilt of her head, taking her wet fingers into her mouth. Agatha groans in frustration, ready to shove her own hand between her legs if she has to. Instead, she is struck silent, in awe as Rio hums contentedly around her own fingers and kneels down in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck no.” Agatha mutters in an answer, a small shake of her head as Rio easily places her fingers back where they rightfully belong. She watches with heaving breaths as brown eyes turn black, a hunger settling in the other woman. The soul starved sex demon within Rio Vidal comes out to play. Rio moans softly as she leans in, needing to take a taste from the source, and using her tongue to swipe across her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>.” Agatha breathes out, tries to reach out and comb her fingers into dark hair, admiring the way she immerses herself into utter passion. But Rio pulls away, </span><em><span>again</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hands on the counter or I stop.” Rio threatens, getting back to the woman in front of her the next second. Agatha grumbles under her breath, something unclear but obviously bratty, her hands find the counter ledge to grip with white knuckles just in time. A moan is punched out of her lungs and her head falls back against the mirror behind her as the lips surrounding her clit sucks so viciously.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit, right there. Right there - </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>!” Agatha gasps, spreading her legs wider. A tongue flicks across her clit, swiping in maddening nonsensical patterns that are, have, and always will drive the brunette wild. Rio bites back a smile in favor of teasing some more, marking a delicate inner thigh with a harsh bite. She hopes Ralph will see it if he gets as far as she is now. It drives Agatha closer to the edge, pulsing around the fingers thrusting inside of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ri-Rio!” Agatha moans desperately. Her grip on the countertop grows so tightly she briefly wonders if she’ll crack the surface. Rio thrusts fast and deep, curling on every outward thrust. Her lips circling Agatha's clit and sucking with a vengeance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're so close already. Hmm?” Rio teases as she feels the familiar fluttering around her fingers, a smirk spreading across her lips like Agatha's arousal, "It would be pathetic if you weren't such a vision - squirming on my fingers and bucking into my mouth just to come.” She leaves a matching mark on the other thigh trembling by her head. Agatha feels her breath stutter. </span><em><span>So, an angry sex demon has a mouth on her. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>.” Agatha growls, looking down at the woman between her legs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>,” Rio mocks, latching back onto her clit and sucking, sending lightning striking through the catcher’s system so she can’t respond. She’s playing Agatha like a fiddle. “Do you want to come?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What kind of stupid question is that?” Agatha bites into her bottom lip, holding in a desperate whine as she careens towards the edge. Rio fucking laughs - </span><em><span>laughs!</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, </span><em><span>baby</span></em><span>, I am not above leaving you hanging off this cliff. It would be delicious retribution for the shit you’ve put me through.” The pitcher torments, a sparkle of vengeance in her dark, demon eyes and her wicked smile sharp with promise. Agatha can barely breath, blinking in disbelief as fear shoots through her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You wouldn’t.” Agatha whispers, a small desperate noise catching in her throat. Rio begins to slow her fingers, only laving her tongue over the brunette’s clit in a feather light touch, a soft hum vibrating against her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It would be my fucking honor to show the great Agatha Harkness exactly how badly she will miss me.” Rio states swiftly, sucking harshly at the throbbing clit in front of her just to feel the delicious tightening of the walls surrounding her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gasps, her breath catching, thighs threatening to close as she comes within seconds of her orgasm. Rio has no idea - </span><em><span>no fucking clue</span></em><span> - just how much Agatha will miss her. And not just this, the sex, but the intimacy and intelligence. Romance and strength - everything. Tears begin to sting her eyes and her jaw tightening as a pathetic sound chokes in her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wanna come, </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>.” Agatha’s voice wavers. Rio hesitates, not believing her ears, raising her eyes to look at the brunette. The woman she has come to know is trying to desperately hide behind the Westview Witch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah? You wanna come?” Rio drops her lips back to her clit, kissing and sucking between her words while picking up the pace of her fingers. Agatha moans, forcing her eyes closed and arching her back for more, not trusting herself to respond with anything but moans. Rio doubles her efforts, putting her all into hitting every spot inside the other woman until she feels the fluttering around her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio swiftly decides exactly how she wants the rest of this to play out, “Come for me, Agatha.” Rio groans against her, forcing her eyes open to watch Agatha come undone. Agatha can’t help herself, she releases the countertop to slide her fingers into raven hair and hold her mouth exactly where she needs as she falls apart, something to ground her. Rio welcomes it, moaning into her cunt and using her free hand to dig her fingers into her thigh to keep her legs apart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” The catcher whines, actually fucking </span><em><span>whines</span></em><span>, all high and desperate and pleading without saying anything more than her name - just like the first time they were together. Rio stands quickly, crushing their lips together in a ferocious kiss. She doesn’t let up, pouring herself into the amazing woman she is losing, all the pain, anger, and lo-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s it,” Rio breathes out, placing her forehead against Agatha’s as she takes deep breathes, “Feels so good, doesn’t it?” Agatha can’t speak, wouldn’t know how to answer that question even if she could. Well, she has an idea. </span><em><span>Yes, please don’t leave.</span></em><span> The hand between her thighs slows but the high of her climax rolls through her still. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio isn’t done. She pulls out her fingers and tugs Agatha off the counter, effectively ruining the brunette’s post orgasmic bliss. A yelp of shock escapes the captain as she struggles to gain a sense of stability on shaky legs. She doesn’t find it any time soon. Not when Rio spins her around to face the counter, the mirror, watching herself in the reflection like it's looking into her soul. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her hair is mussed, sex crazed, lips swollen and red, pupils blown so wide there is barely any blue left. Rio stands behind her, a strong grip on her waist, as she looks into the same reflection to see what Agatha sees. She doesn’t wait to study this vulgar image of them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw goes slack as three fingers enter her from behind, thrusting deep enough to push her hips flush against the counter’s ledge, sharp laminate digging into her skin. Her hands scramble to find purchase on the sink, anything to hold on to. Rio wastes no time, fulfilling her plans to make them into reality, setting a punishing pace as her other hand slips up into brown locks, taking hold there with a soft tug. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A gasping, guttural groan leeches from Agatha’s throat. Her eyes threaten to roll back in her head but she forces herself to watch Rio through the mirror. She takes note of the messy hair she caused, the flexing in her bicep as she fucks her, and the downright demonic look in her dark eyes that study how easily her fingers fill Agatha’s cunt. It shouldn’t turn her on as much as it does.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You look </span><em><span>so good</span></em><span>. Desperate enough to beg, aren't you?” It's barely a mutter of words, barely able to be heard over Agatha's moans and obscene arousal, but she hears it anyway. Her body tightens at the thought. Leave it to Rio to dangle the precipice of pure bliss over her head in exchange for her own unraveling.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio catches barely blue eyes staring at her and smirks, dark and wanting - a promise for more glinting in her eyes. She moves closer, pressing into Agatha’s ass to keep her pinned against the counter, and dropping the hand tangled in her hair down, down, down to her aching clit. Agatha’s going to combust - everything feels so good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Beg me to come and make it sound nice and pretty - you only get one chance.” Rio whispers into her ear. Delighted in the way Agatha sways from the pleasure racking her body like volts of electricity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans, annoyed by the pitcher's proposition, and wondering how the hell she can get out of it. That was before Rio pushed deeper, finding the spot inside of her that feels </span><em><span>so good</span></em><span> her eyes rolled back into her head and a loud, unrestrained cry of pleasure tears from her chest. At that moment, she can give it to Rio - </span><em><span>she wants to</span></em><span>. Her eyes slip closed with the next moan that escapes her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, please make me come again.” For the second time that night, Rio can’t believe her ears. Her thrusts stutter before steadying again. It’s what she wanted but why isn’t she satisfied? Rio grunts, doubling her efforts and sending the brunette careening toward bliss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Again,” Rio demands, “Look me in the eyes and say my name.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha's eyes open, desperate and willing, and so close to falling over the edge. Rio looks hurt and lustful and it tears the brunette into pieces to see her like this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, please make me come for you. </span><em><span>Please</span></em><span>, I-I need it.” Agatha moans, eyes slipping shut with the sting of tears in her eyes. </span><em><span>I need you</span></em><span>. Rio melts, helplessly held captive by Agatha Harkness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay. Give me one more, you can do it.” Agatha moans deeply, shaking on Rio’s fingers. She is falling toward her second orgasm in seconds. Her hands clutch desperately at porcelain as her knees go weak. Rio is holding her up as best she can while stroking her clit and fucking three fingers into her. She falls forward, trapping Rio’s arm where her fingers still thrum against her clit, her hands reaching out to keep herself stable no matter how fast she is falling over the edge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, fuck, </span><em><span>fuck,</span></em><span>” Agatha whimpers, bucking into her hand with the new leverage as she comes a second time. Pants, moans, whimpers and curses fill the air between them. She is shaking, desperately satisfied and still craving more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio curls her fingers, drawing out the last of her orgasm for as long as she can. The fingers inside of her slow to lazy thrusts deep inside of her. Agatha’s legs are trembling now, each breath simultaneously calming her nerves and lighting her on fire because everything that is </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span> is surrounding her. It’s too much, too real - too </span><em><span>final</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I-I” She stutters, still trying to catch her breath, the emotion in her throat catching on her words. She can barely think let alone speak but she needs to apologize - she needs Rio to hear it. Because, god damn it, Lilia is right - Rio shouldn't be drinking herself to death because of her. She's not worth it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t,” Rio whispers, shaking her head shortly, slowly pulling out of her to back away. The rejection and withdrawal sends a chill through Agatha. She pushes herself up to take her own weight again, still relying on her hands more than her legs to keep herself from falling over. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio.” She tries again even if the small plea falls on deaf ears. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Don’t</span></em><span>, Agatha.” Rio wipes off her hand, stealing the discarded bottle of vodka from the counter, not even glancing in the brunette’s direction. “I can’t hear it again. I won’t - just, </span><em><span>this never happened</span></em><span>. Right?” It burns, the fire in her words singes her tongue as soon as they leave her. Mostly because she doesn’t mean them and she would want nothing more than to wrap Agatha in her arms and ask her where they went wrong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Instead, she drinks from the bottle of vodka and pushes out of the bathroom into the still bustling party. She stumbles down the stairs right into the trio’s arms. Bad luck. She groans as Lilia gives her a disapproving look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay, come on.” Lilia whispers softly, gently pulling the nearly empty bottle away and handing it off to a random person much to Rio’s displeasure. “Let’s get you home.” The pitcher puts up a fight at first but eventually falls into line with the three women marching her back to her dorm room. Ending the night the opposite of how Rio had hoped - alone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha had hoped for the latter and got the opposite instead. Ralph trails after her on the way home, trying desperately to get in her pants, which she refuses at every turn. He’s drunk off of his ass, enough so that when Agatha disappears into her bathroom he passes out onto the couch instead of the bed - thankfully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha emerges from the bathroom with her wet hair piled on top of her head in a bun, a loose fitting pajama shirt and shorts hanging off her tired body. If those clothes are ones that Rio had a habit of wearing, it was no one’s business but her own. She nearly forgets Ralph is there until he speaks, causing her to jump. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why did you get back together with me?” Ralph asks, no longer slurring his words like he was before. Suddenly calm and collected. Agatha calms her beating heart, shooting a glare towards the man on her couch, and walks into the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because.” It’s an answer she’s given him multiple times but it doesn’t seem efficient enough this time. She gets both of them a glass of water and snags a bottle of Advil from the junk drawer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on Agatha. Give me a real answer. I can take it.” Ralph insists, pulling himself to sit up, taking the glass of water with a thankful mumble. Agatha sighs softly, rubbing her temple to rid herself of the headache crawling under her very skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because, I need to play the part of the straight daughter of Evanora Harkness.” She says in one quick breath, slumping into the sofa beside him and popping two pills of Advil. She hadn’t really thought about what she said - not until Ralph pointed it out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You need to play the part of a straight woman…so, that means you’re not one?” Ralph wonders, deep in thought as he takes his own Advil. Agatha freezes, her blood running cold, putting her on edge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not - wait, ugh, god damn it. I need another drink.” Agatha groans, squeezing her eyes shut and pinching the bridge of her nose. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get it.” Ralphs says softly, shocking Agatha to her core, blue eyes flying open to look at the man, “I mean - shit, Agatha, you’ve never liked me. I just figured I was an end to your means somehow. I never expected us to last.” Ralph reasons calmly, as if discussing Agatha’s sexuality was a normal topic of conversation. Agatha struggles to come up with a response. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, you just don’t care that I…don’t like you?” Agatha says it slowly, trying and failing to come up with the right words. Ralph chuckles, sipping on his water and relaxing into the sofa. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, yeah, </span><em><span>ouch</span></em><span> - that hurts, but I’ll live.” He shrugs a shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And if I was…” She trails off, struggling to say the words aloud. Part of her believes that Rio is the only woman who she would fall for. Also, </span><em><span>fuck labels</span></em><span>. “…a, uh </span><em><span>lesbian</span></em><span>?” She says it in a mumble with a reluctant twist in her words but she gets it out. Ralph is amused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everyone has their thing.” Ralph dismisses her concerns without a second thought before continuing, “I mean, I thought we were doing pretty good.” Agatha scoffs, a small smirk crossing her lips when the man chuckles lightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But I obviously think with my dick,” Ralph continues, pulling an honest to god snort from Agatha in response, “So, I’ve only just now noticed how miserable you are.” </span><em><span>Oh, well that kind of hits too close to home.</span></em><span> Agatha takes a sip of water and glances at Ralph who seems to be looking at her with pity. </span><em><span>Pity</span></em><span>, from </span><em><span>Ralph</span></em><span>, of all people. That’s got to be a new low. She wishes the water was vodka. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve only noticed because you’re not jumping me like you’d normally do when we get back together.” Ralph points out swiftly. And, well, that makes Agatha feel a little better. At least her tragic life isn’t </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> noticeable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“God, you’re an idiot.” Agatha mutters, defelcting as usual, silently wondering how Ralph, her stupid, frat boy, naive ex-boyfriend, has actually made sense about her little conundrum. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph sighs softly, “Yeah, I know.” They sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes before curiosity kills the cat, so to speak. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, who’s the girl?” Ralph wonders. Agatha doesn’t even have the energy to roll her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not talking about that with you. That’s not how we work now.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph looks genuinely offended, “Why not? We both like pu-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> finish that sentence," Agatha says quickly, sending the man a glare only to be met with a stupidly bright, wide grin. He chuckles and drinks the rest of his water before standing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whoever it is,” Ralph pauses dramatically, sending the brunette a hopeful look, so that she might crack and tell him about her secret crush, but is met with an unimpressed look so he continues, “They must make you happy - like really happy - and you deserve to be happy.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha releases a well practiced groan of annoyance, “Ugh, when did you get so </span><em><span>sappy</span></em><span>? Did your dick fall off or something?” Ralph releases a loud, amused laugh, almost pulling a smile from the brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Always a pleasure, Agatha. I’ll see you around,” The man pulls the door open with a wink and saunters off into the hallway with all the smugness and audacity of a fucking frat boy. Agatha shakes her head and lets her head fall back against the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She needs to find a way out of the death trap of a life her mother has put her in or she will end up with a husband exactly like Ralph and she just can’t live like that. Her eyes glance over to the potted plant sitting by the window and feels her throat tighten at the thought of Rio. </span></p><p><br/><span>Agatha has to do </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> - and she needs help doing it.</span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>“So…your mother is blackmailing Rio?” Jen wonders aloud, eyes narrowing slightly, skeptically, as she lounges on her captain’s plush couch nursing a glass of wine. Lilia and Alice on either side of her. If you had asked her what she would be doing on a Monday night before their senior year of exams, this would not be it. Although Agatha did invite them over under the guise of wine and studying - so far they’ve only done the former. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha answers swiftly, almost annoyed by the question. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But uh not - like, not to her face?” Alice muttered unsurely, head tilted slightly in confusion, sipping her wine. Her second glass. Maybe that is why everything coming out of Agatha’s mouth sounds so confusing right now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, to mine.” The brunette clarifies swiftly, “What am I saying that doesn’t make sense?” She asks tightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Evanora Harkness is blackmailing Rio, via you, to keep you away from her, to protect the image of the family business.” Lilia states clearly and casually, pouring more wine into her glass, always having been able to look at the big picture and decipher the nonsense that confuses anyone else. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly!” Agatha exclaims in relief, a small sigh leaving her as she takes a seat in the chair across from the trio sitting on the couch. Jen and Alice hum softly in understanding as they nod their heads, understanding the situation now.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How exactly are we supposed to help with that? Seems like a family issue.” Jen’s face twists in distaste. Alice elbows her in the ribs and she sends her friend a glare. Not that it lasts long because Alice smirks in response and it makes Jen’s glare a little soft around the edges. Agatha rolls her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have a plan - obviously.” The captain says simply. The trio waits for their leader to continue only to be met with silence. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are we supposed to guess or something?” Jen asks bluntly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I- uh, I need you to do things for me.” Agatha hesitates, biting her tongue to prevent a certain word from slipping. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit,” Lilia deadpans, shocking them all at the sudden vulgar language. It doesn’t phase the slightly older woman in the slightest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right,” Agatha clears her throat and sips from her wine glass. “How do you feel-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wait, hold on. I want to hear you say it.” Jen says smugly, knowing exactly which words the stubborn brunette was holding in. Agatha huffs and runs her fingers through her hair, clearly stalling, but the first baseman waits patiently alongside their team mates. Yeah, Jen isn’t giving in anytime soon. She purses her lips and sighs softly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I need your help.” The words are mumbled into her wine glass but they are words. Jen smiles, happy with the obvious win over her long time friend and shrugs her shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That wasn't so bad, was it?” Agatha groans and glares but pushes through her annoyance to get to the task at hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She divulges her plan to the trio, step by step, every detail spread out in front of them like a crime scene. It may be a little too in depth, a little too dangerous, but her mother is a wicked woman and protecting Rio and herself will take a lot of premeditated steps. Lilia, Jen and Alice agree to the plan, after some convincing from their captain then even pitching in a few ideas to help solidify a few holes in her logic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Remind me what the sentence is for breaking and entering?” Jen whispers softly, watching Alice pick the lock of none other than Evanora Harkness’ office door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Once again, not where she thought she would be on a Saturday night. In Boston, breaking into her friend’s mother's office in the hopes of finding something to reverse blackmail the CEO. She also doesn't expect the sudden pull of attraction in her chest from watching Alice pick a lock. She chalks it up to nerves and pushes it to the back of her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You're so dramatic. It's a misdemeanor with fines at the most.” Agatha huffs, keeping an eye on the door they came through. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uhm, Google says there is significant jail time.” Lilia, currently sitting in Agatha's Bronco as their getaway driver, says over the phone currently nuzzled up to Jen's ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What!?” Jen screeches loudly. Alice and Agatha shoot her a glare.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up.” Agatha hisses slowly, trying to keep her voice down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia says there is significant jail time.” Jen hisses back, a fierce glare firing back at the brunette, “</span><em><span>Significant</span></em><span>!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha scoffs, “Oh, please. Lilia doesn't know what she's talking about. She’s like </span><em><span>seventy</span></em><span> years old. Does she even know how to Google?” The captain excuses swiftly, nudging Alice and waving her hands hurriedly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>If Lilia is right, she probably, definitely is, then they need to keep moving. She bribed the guard downstairs with a solid stack of five hundred dollars cash to keep his mouth shut and the cameras off for the next thirty minutes. It's already been fifteen minutes wasted on Alice fumbling with the office lock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey,” Lilia gasps in offense, “I heard that, Harkness. Tell her I heard that.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen rolls her eyes. “Lilia says she heard-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you two shut it?” Alice snaps, guilty eyes glancing over to the two women to see shocked faces. “Sorry Jen, just be quiet so I can focus.” Alice grunts, her eyes glancing at the first baseman with a slight blush on her cheeks. Jen feels a small smile tugging at her lips. Agatha's eyes narrow at her teammates and crosses her arms.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don't get an apology?” Agatha asks expectantly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut up, Agatha,” the two teammates say in unison. A deeper flush skates up Alice's neck. Jen is so obviously holding back a smirk. Agatha is seconds from pointing out the obvious tension between the two, wondering when they started making doe eyes at each other, when the lock finally clicks with victory. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Alice sighs heavily in relief, removing her tools from the lock and wipes the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank god,” Agatha mumbles softly. “I didn't have a second of doubt. Now, move.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen swiftly helps Alice to her feet to avoid being ran over by Agatha who pushes into the office. It's not a surprise that they end up facing each other so closely. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good job,” Jen breathes out softly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks,” Alice mumbles with a humble smirk. The silence stretches between them for far too long. So long that Lilia has to clear her throat over the phone just to snap them into motion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right, we should-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yep.” Alice agrees readily, feeling her stomach flutter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are we looking for, Agatha? A folder that says ‘blackmail: CEO eyes only’ or something along those lines.” Jen asks, quickly moving on from whatever </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> was with Alice.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wish.” Agatha mutters, already searching through the drawers in the desk. Five minutes pass and Agatha starts to feel like ripping her hair out or maybe even jumping out the window. They're losing time and they've got nothing. Not even a post-it note out of order. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Five minutes.” Lilia reminds them swiftly, carefree as she shuffles her deck of tarot cards. The flutter of the cards comes across the phone which is now on speaker sitting on the desk. Agatha groans in annoyance and frustration - the flutter of cards tipping her toward the deep end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia, I swear to go-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Alice interrupts the brunette’s wrath, “Have you guys seen The Heat?” She ventures toward the old fireplace on the far side of the room.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The what?” Agatha asks in confusion, shaking her head.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The Heat. It's a movie…Sandra Bullock. Melissa McCarthy.” Alice elaborates casually, running her hand along the fireplace mantel. Agatha can’t even comprehend the words being aimed at her right now. Jen, is a little more understanding, attempting to decode the words the second baseman is saying. It’s not working but she’s trying. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that the same girl from Devil Wears Prada?” Lilia questions over the phone, completely enthralled with the new mystery. Alice either doesn’t hear the question or ignores it entirely, Agatha isn’t sure. She is pretty sure throwing Alice down a flight of stairs is in the realm of possibility. The second baseman lifts her hand to the brass lion sitting on the wood of the mantle before turning to face the two women. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s a really funny mov-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It’s Agatha’s turn to interrupt the second baseman, “Why </span><em><span>the fuck</span></em><span> are you-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They talk about prohibition in the first scene,” Alice smirks and tugs on the lion’s head, snapping it forward and triggering a trap door in the woodwork of the mantle that flies open behind her, “and all the places people used to hide their booze.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy shit.” Agatha stands in utter shock, gaping at the little hidey-hole filled with files and hard drives. Exactly what she was looking for. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What? What’s happening?” Lilia asks with a slight panic in her voice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking genious,” Jen mutters, watching Alice’s cheeks heat red and wondering when that started to happen so often. And when she started to enjoy it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alice, I love you.” Agatha says swiftly, walking to the fireplace and snatching the contents from inside, “I think I mean that. Truly.” Jen scowls when Alice’s blush gets deeper, taking a handful of files into her arms handed to her by the brunette. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you call </span><em><span>me </span></em><span>dramatic?” Jen jests quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are.” Agatha responds with a scoff. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Am not.” Jen glares.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are too.” Agatha smiles, tossing Alice a few hard drives. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are so-” Jen begins, frustration basically leaking from her pores alongside her anxiety and adrenaline. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Alice has had enough, “Hey! Can we get out of here now? I feel like I’m gonna catch a generational curse just being in here.” She shivers as she looks around the room, finally taking account of the very creepy, dark office. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha doesn't waste any time. They are back at the softball captain’s apartment before long, pouring over every single file as Alice works her magic breaking into the hard drives. There is a mutual consensus throughout the group. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Evanora is an evil fucking witch. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>The blackmail she holds over clients, public figures, politicians and CEO’s alike - knows no bounds. Each piece of information ranges from dark sordid details of money laundering or sex trafficking to affairs and judge pay offs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen swallows down the last of the vodka in her cup, welcoming the sting as she tosses down a folder detailing the specifics of a certain politician using drug money to support their campaign. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think I’ve lost all hope in humanity.” She says with a sigh, leaning back and rubbing her eyes to rid her mind of the images. Agatha sets down her own folder, hers having been the last in the pile, and while she is forever traumatized, she is also relieved. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Simply because she can ruin her Mother. It will take nothing more than a lengthy trip to a copier and file download to copy proof of her manipulation. Surely the proof is enough to keep Evanora Harkness at bay. The woman is a raging narcissist after all - image is everything and Agatha has the key to destroying it. She hopes it’s enough. After making the copies and storing them safely with Lilia, they return the originals to the office and hatch a plan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A week later, the four of them attend The Westview Winter Gala. It’s a big event for Westview, only having been introduced a few years ago but quickly gaining momentum from the beginning. Everyone who is everyone is there. Including Evanora Harkness, networking with the best of the best for Harkness Energy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mother,” Agatha greets tightly but sporting a good natured smile anyway. Evanora and Tony Stark turn towards her at her approach. Evanora seems surprised, though she hides it well, but it isn’t a shock to Agatha since she wasn’t technically invited. Certainly not by her Mother who seemed to avoid her like the plague after blackmailing her own daughter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tony.” Tony has the decency to look a little guilty. </span><em><span>Good</span></em><span>. He should be. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Darling,” Evanora smiles brightly though there is an edge to her words, “I didn’t think you could attend since finals are this week.” An excuse but a good one considering she pulls it out of her ass. Cold, annoyed blue eyes skate over her in mild disgust and surprised appreciation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha pays no mind. She </span><em><span>knows</span></em><span> she looks good. Encased in succulent purple silk, the evening gown draped to the floor with a slit in the dress that comes dangerously close to her hip. The cleavage is a little more daring but she’s proud and wears it confidently. Her hair flows over her shoulders in reckless yet flawless waves.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, you look amazing.” Tony forces a smile, tries not to let his gaze wander and fails. </span><em><span>Miserably.</span></em><span> Agatha remembers reading his file - paid off frat boys for a drunken hazing incident, adultery, money laundering, drug abuse - the list is long. Evanora was right, Tony Stark has been on her payroll and blacklist for a </span><em><span>long</span></em><span> time.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha ignores him, “Do you have a minute to speak mother?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Evanora bristles but keeps her smile tightly across her face. “Of course, dear. Let’s go somewhere a little more pri-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Here is fine. If you would excuse us, Tony.” It’s bold, some would say rude, but Agatha wants her mother to know just how serious she is. That seems to do it because the cold facade falters and Evanora’s blue eyes light with a small fire of fury right in the pupils. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Public disobedience - not something Evanora Harkness admires. It gives Agatha a rush of adrenaline and pleasure just as fear and anxiety twist her stomach into knots. She’s thankful Lilia all but force fed her a shot of vodka, otherwise her hands would be shaking. She feels the three pairs of eyes warming her back as the trio watches from a nearby table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Tony is thoroughly baffled but stumbles on, “Right. I have…things to do. People to see.” He excuses himself quickly, walking off in a direction neither woman cares about because they still haven’t broken eye contact. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought I taught you better manners than to treat an associate like that.” Evanora speaks lightly despite the disappointment sharpening her words. Agatha raises her eyebrows. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why treat him with anything but what he deserves?” Agatha feigns innocence, taking a step forward as her mother’s face clouds briefly with confusion, “The </span><em><span>book</span></em><span> you have on Stark is enough to warrant a lot more than a cold shoulder.” It takes a second, Agatha’s heart beating nearly out of her chest as she sees it, but realization flashes in glacier eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Evanora sizes her up then, truly, seriously, dangerously for the first time in Agatha’s life. For once, Agatha is a </span><em><span>threat</span></em><span>. She finally understands what her mother likes about doing this - harboring dark, vile secrets in exchange for whatever she wants. It is </span><em><span>power</span></em><span> - nothing more, nothing less. Raw, unfiltered energy flushes through her body as a dangerous smirk stretches across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s right,” Agatha confirms softly, keeping her voice low, “I know about your Blacklist.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you?” Evanora spits out, a smile no longer on her face but still holding onto the untouchable facade. Only Agatha can see the absolute rage, the bonfire burning inside of the older woman. She relishes it, warms her hands in its heat, because nothing has ever felt this good. Nothing has ever felt better than being one step ahead of Evanora Harkness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was bound to find out eventually wasn’t I, Mother? I am the heiress to the family business, after all, I should know exactly how you came into all that </span><em><span>wealth</span></em><span>.” She sneers at the word, feeling it drip with the dark dirty secrets that filled those files. Evanora begins to crack right in front of her eyes. A lip twitch here, a squint of her eyes there and suddenly Evanora Harkness is nothing more than a ball of fury that Agatha can’t wait to put out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t know a single thing you speak of, </span><em><span>little girl</span></em><span>.” It’s not quite a snarl but it sure comes close to a growl. Agatha can’t help it, the smirk on her face widens into a smile, a sharp quick laugh thickening the tension between them with ease. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“On the contrary, Mother.” She leans in, close, refusing to drop her eyes as her smile turns dark, seeking revenge for her entire childhood. “I know </span><em><span>so much</span></em><span>.” Agatha stretches out the words, having far too much fun torturing the woman who has held a knife to her throat and told her not to move her entire life. It feels good to rip that knife away and flip it around, daring the other woman to move.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Except, Evanora does move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It’s lightning quick. Agatha feels an ice cold grip around her wrist and bony fingers digging into the small of her back as she is ushered from the party.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let me show you exactly how much you don't know.” Panic flares in her chest as her smile drops. This wasn’t part of the plan. Evanora was supposed to save face in such a public space, come to a reluctant but reasonable agreement - Agatha lives her life with Rio and Evanora leaves them alone. No muss, no fuss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>But, no. Evanora escorts her from the Gala with a bruising grip. Agatha sends one last glance over her shoulder to the table where she knows the trio is watching her. Except…they aren’t. They’re distractedly speaking to none other than </span><em><span>Rio fucking Vidal</span></em><span> who stands beside the table in a waiter’s uniform looking mildly perplexed by her teammates attending the Gala. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is swept around a dark corner, away from them.</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Fuck.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you guys doing here?” Rio questions curiously, setting the drinks down in front of her teammates. All three jaws are dropped, flailing for an answer that makes sense beside - </span><em><span>helping Agatha blackmail her mother so you two can be together</span></em><span>. They all end up answering at the same time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmm?” Lilia feigns her confusion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you saying I’m not good enough to attend a Gala, Vidal?” Jen sasses with a scowl, earning a raised eyebrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m a party crasher.” Alice blurts. They all turn to look at the third woman and a flush fills Alice’s cheeks. Jen sends the woman a curious look with widening eyes. The woman shrugs helplessly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio narrows her eyes at the trio in utter skepticism, “</span><em><span>What?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, Mother of God,” Lilia huffs in disappointment, looking past Rio to the table where Agatha is supposed to be standing. Except the captain is gone. She throws her hands up in exhaustion as she exclaims, “</span><em><span>She’s gone!</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>What?</span></em><span>” Alice and Jen screech in unison, snapping their heads to look towards the now unoccupied table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who?” Rio asks in confusion and increasing frustration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking Agatha. She can't stick to a plan to save her life, can she?” Jen grumbles, slamming back the rest of her drink while the pitcher recovers from the whiplash at the mention of Agatha. “Okay, we need to split up and find her.” Alice mutters an agreement, gulping down the rest of her drink as well. Rio’s mind struggles to catch up but it doesn’t take long. Something is wrong and Agatha is at the center of it. That's all she really needs to know, isn’t it?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I swear to god if you three don’t tell me-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha can't be alone with her mother, that is all you need to know.” Jen snaps quickly, lashing out in frustration. The last thing she wants to do is ruin the plan but it’s already pretty fucked up considering neither Agatha or Evanora is anywhere in sight. Rio is here and concerned because despite all Agatha has done - </span><em><span>Rio cares</span></em><span>. Are they really not going to let her in on the plan? Alice lays a gentle hand on Jen's arm, giving her an understanding look.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If Agatha is in trouble I should…I don't know…be there for her.” Rio hesitates, not sure if her words are as accurate as she wants them to be. She has no right to Agatha besides caring for her as a team mate even though she cares for her a lot more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“An extra set of eyes can’t hurt. There are four walls in the room,” Lilia begins swiftly, understanding the pitcher's concern and immediately incorporating her into the plan to avoid losing any more time. “Pick a wall and work your way in. We’ll find her.” Lilia says strongly, walking away from the group without a second thought. Rio leaves second, dodging and weaving through the crows searching for frizzy brown hair while her heart beats out of her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha stumbles slightly, catching her balance as soon as her Mother finishes whipping her around a corner. The halls of the old Westview Capitol building are dark, drafty and smells of dusty novels. Perfect for Evanora to corner her daughter with an evil look in her eye. Perfect to no longer need to save face. A finger, bony and very skeletal jabs into her sternum. She winces as the force of it makes her take a step back, fear clenching her lungs in a tight fist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let me tell you where you’ve gone wrong, </span><em><span>my dear</span></em><span>.” Evanora wastes no time pushing forward, a dark look settling dangerously in her eyes as they narrow on her daughter. Agatha keeps moving back, step for step, watching her every move but trying to stay strong, as she hits a wall at her back.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve backed you into a corner for the first time in your life. I think I’ve only gone </span><em><span>right</span></em><span>.” Agatha responds, her voice a little shaky but her words cut like a knife. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Evanora huffs, “That list? The one you so carelessly and foolishly flaunt around? That gives you </span><em><span>life</span></em><span>. You have no idea the consequences if you were to bring it to light.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know enough,” Agatha responds swiftly, tilting her chin in a challenge, “I know those files could destroy the one thing you love most. Spoiler, it’s not me.” Evanora bristles but stays silent, clenching and clenching her jaw as she shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, you’re blackmailing me with blackmail? That’s your big idea? </span><em><span>You imbecile</span></em><span>.” Evanora’s comments are getting a little lackluster. She’s flustered and flailing for a grip on the power her daughter holds. Agatha smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It seems to be working.” The brunette preens at how true her words are. Her mother can’t exactly contest. Evanora takes a second, narrows her eyes and clenches her fist only for it to unclench with a shaking hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you want?” The words come out as a growl. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio,” Agatha doesn’t hesitate or stutter, she knows what she wants. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Evanora tilts her head slightly with a short laugh, “Rio? </span><em><span>The bartender</span></em><span>? You could ask for anything and you choose a woman you’ve known for six months? That is who you want to throw away your life for? You could have empires under your heel but you choose </span><em><span>her</span></em><span>.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is an unmovable force, “I’m not asking.” She takes a step forward, pulling back her shoulders and narrowing her eyes. “And I’m not giving up my birthright either.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She continues even when her mother’s gaze flashes with a promise of danger. “I’m not like you, Mother. I can run the company better than you and I plan to do it all without blackmailing the people who really built it.” Evanora laughs, a piercing sound that nearly makes the brunette jump from the unfamiliarity of it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Really built it? </span></em><span>You’re delusional, Agatha. You have nothing but dreams in that thick head of yours. Ideas and plans that will crumble my entire life’s work in a day. I won’t let it happen. No daughter of mine will-”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she speaks - Agatha scoffs and rolls her eyes, shoves her tongue into her cheek - a habit she picked up from Rio, ironically - only for a cold hand to grip her jaw in a painful grasp. The brunette swallows roughly, feeling her blood run cold at the touch. No people, no eyes, and no one to stop Evanora Harkness from laying hands on her daughter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I remember teaching you not to roll your eyes.” Evanora hisses, painted and pointed nails digging into soft flesh. Agatha’s jaw twinges in pain. “Do you remember learning your lesson or do I have to teach you again?” As if called upon, the memory surfaces. Young thirteen year old Agatha wrote a thousand sentences until her hand bled and her eyes cried dry. Evanora didn’t always jump to corporal punishment but in her older years she seems to favor it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha attempts a sly smile through the grasp on her, “I remember you being more </span><em><span>creative</span></em><span> in your punishments. Something you must have lost with old age, do you think Mother?” The resounding slap of the back of Evanora’s hand covers the sound of footsteps approaching. Agatha feels dizzy as she stumbles back, grabbing onto the wall and raising a hand to her mouth in shock. Her mother has never hit her before. Threatened and dug the talons that she calls nails into her skin but never like this. The taste of copper bursts across her tongue and her fingers come away from her lip slick with blood. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha!” Rio shouts in shock, having followed the rising voice when she didn’t see the brunette in the main hall. She hadn’t even known who she had stumbled upon when she rounded the corner but the smack had echoed. As soon as she saw who it was her heart dropped into her stomach and her fist clenched in anger. She rushes to her side, not sparing Evanora a glance as she wraps her arm around Agatha’s waist. She uses a gentle hand to tilt Agatha’s jaw up to look at the split in her lip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha blinks. Then blinks harder. Because there is no way Rio is standing beside her, holding her steady with such a concerned look in her eyes. After everything she has done? Her body can’t help itself, leaning into the support with relief and even more so knowing it is Rio holding her steady. The smell of her, the touch - Agatha feels a little dizzy all over again. Then those brown eyes turn dark, black even, with something so fueled by fury Agatha feels her heart curl into itself, thinking it’s for her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>What makes you think you can lay a hand on her?</span></em><span>” Rio hisses in a low voice, swiftly moving her gaze to Evanora. Her grip doesn’t falter, her voice doesn’t shake and she meets the older woman eye for eye. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha swallows roughly, staring wide-eyed at the woman she essentially tossed aside at the drop of a hat with a false explanation that rattled her own soul. But, here she is, defending her to her mother who has anyone and everyone shaking in their boots with just a look. Apparently everyone but Rio. Rio is </span><em><span>here</span></em><span>. The CEO doesn’t look shaken but she doesn’t look as strong as she normally would either. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My daughter and I have business that doesn’t involve </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>,” Evanora sneers, disgust clear in every word. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I beg to differ,” Rio lets out an indignant laugh, narrowing her eyes, “If you touch her again, it will be </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> business and I will make it y</span><em><span>our</span></em><span> problem.” Her voice is nothing more than a threat, a promise and a hope. The raven haired woman steps forward, leaving Agatha’s side to advance on the older woman. Agatha misses her touch even if Rio leaves to protect her. Evanora takes a step back at the sudden advance and it makes the brunette smirk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you understand me?” Rio whispers, it should sound soft but the weight of her words lands like a punch, her head tilting dangerously as she sizes up the other woman. Agatha realizes there is always a demon living inside of Rio, a devil, it just depends on the scenario to bring it out. It finally snaps the old woman out of whatever shock she was in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Evanora curls her lips into a near snarl, “You don’t know who you’re talking-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Frankly, lady, I don’t give a damn.” Rio interrupts bluntly, not a fuck to give. Agatha can’t help it, a small laugh leaves her lips. Not a single person on this Earth has spoken to the woman that way and Agatha is eating it up. Evanora is aghast at such foul language. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio? Agatha?” Lilia calls out as she walks around the corner, spotting the three of them quickly. It doesn’t take long for Jen and Alice to follow behind her. “Wha-Agatha, what happened?” Lilia asks, appalled as she spots the blood on her lip and is quick to come to her side. Jen and Alice come to stand on either side of Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m assuming you and Agatha came to an understanding? Or will we need to up the stakes a bit?” Jen asks calmly, tilting her head as she stares down the older woman. “Hmm? Release a few files to the public, maybe? You have a connection to The Boston Globe, don’t you, Alice?” Evanora swallows roughly as she looks over the group, looking more and more frightened as the time goes on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Even better, I’ve got them on speed dial.” Alice says proudly, smirking triumphantly when icy blue eyes turn fearful as she pulls out her phone. It may be a bluff, her cousin does work at The Boston Globe but only as a front desk clerk, and still - Evanora looks rattled.  She tries to hide it as she stands up straight and meets them each eye to eye but they’ve all seen it now, the flicker of uncertainty and fear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This isn’t over,” Evanora promises, looking down at the hand she used to smack Agatha with as a smirk crawls across her lips, blood smearing across a knuckle or two, “But I’ll appease you for now, Agatha, just don’t get too comfortable.” She connects their eyes over Rio’s shoulder, a new fire blazing in them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re a wretched little bitch,” Evanora hisses, “Desperate for approval and too arrogant to deserve it. You may have my blood but you are not my daughter. I ought to have killed you as soon as you left my body-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Enough</span></em><span>,” Rio growls, stepping forward but Evanora doesn’t back away this time - doesn’t even spare the pitcher a glance as she continues. Agatha feels the pain in her chest from the words. Despite everything, Evanora is her mother, even if she never acted like one. She has long since gained back her balance but the older woman beside her doesn’t release her hold. Lilia’s grip on her hip tightens and it quells the pain just a little. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have evil in your veins, Agatha. You’ll push them all away eventually. It’s your nature. Try as hard as you’d like but you will end up like me all the same - </span><em><span>alone.</span></em><span>” Evanora hisses, taking a step back as Rio takes another step forward, finally retreating from the hallway. A proud smirk on her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio could kill her. It would solve so many problems, wouldn’t it? “Say what you want but she’ll never be alone.” Rio responds strongly, making the older woman stutter in her steps before finally leaving them. Agatha’s shoulders ease, the tension finally unraveling from her body.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry. I-” Agatha begins softly, shaking her head and pulling herself away from Lilia, but the pitcher interrupts. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t apologize for her.” Rio leaves no room for argument as she spins around, zeroing in on the cut gracing a plump bottom lip. Agatha closes her mouth, a soft sigh escaping her. Anger flares in Rio but she tamps it down as her stomach twists with concern instead. She takes a few strides to meet the brunette, standing in front of her as her hands hesitantly raise to cup her jaw. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you okay?” Rio whispers, brow furrowed as her thumb rubs across the redness spreading over the captain’s cheek. She relishes in being so close, desperately wanting nothing more than to wrap her up and keep her close but she doesn’t. Agatha releases a sigh, melting at her touch as tears prickle at the back of her eyes. She raises her hands to caress Rio’s wrists, keeping her close.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha tries again, means it full-heartedly and hopes Rio understands she is apologizing for more than just her mother. Rio tilts her head slightly, readjusts her grip to a firmer but still soft hold, tilting the brunette’s chin up as she lets her lips turn up slightly in a small smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not what I asked.” Rio responds. This is where she belongs. How could she even fathom being anywhere else? The captain won’t be able to push her away again. Agatha sighs again, looking drained but a smile gracing her lip anyway. The stretch of skin makes her wince and Rio’s smile drops in another wave of concern.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You guys are disgustingly cute.” Jen says loudly, cutting off their moment and earning an admonishing nudge from Alice, “What? I’m just saying, maybe let’s get out of here? I need a real drink and you two need to talk.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I second that,” Lilia chirps. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Third,” Alice says through a sigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, that’s a good idea.” Agatha nods her head and reluctantly allows the raven haired woman to pull away. “I…Uh, </span><em><span>thank you</span></em><span> - all of you.” It’s hard to say at first but she means it. She wouldn’t be here without their help. The admission makes the trio smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t bother finishing her shift, all but ordering Agatha to let her drive her home. It’s quiet, the car crackling with unsaid words but even the proximity to one another gives them comfort. When they reach Agatha’s apartment Rio sits her down on the couch and rummages through the bathroom before returning with a first aid kit the brunette didn’t even know she had. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m going to talk first and you’re going to listen,” Rio begins softly, opening the kit and pulling out a pad of gauze. Agatha parts her lips to speak but promptly closes them when Rio sends her a look. </span><em><span>Listen, right.</span></em><span> The pitcher gingerly pats at the blood, wiping away anything dried and soaking up the rest.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You hurt me.” Agatha feels a knife in her chest, wincing as the gauze catches on her cut but she listens. “But I couldn’t get you out of my head no matter how hard I tried.” Rio admits pulling away to inspect the cut, satisfied when the blood is wiped away to reveal a small split in her lip. Something that will heal fairly quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, I’m here.” Rio breathes out, cradling Agatha’s strong jaw while scanning her for more abuse, “and I’m sticking around so you may as well tell me about the little plan of yours before I start making dramatically incorrect assumptions.” She smiles softly, hoping to convince the brunette. Agatha swallows roughly and parts her lips before hesitating, continuing only when Rio doesn’t stop her. One question runs through her mind over and over again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Why?</span></em><span>” Agatha mutters in confusion. “Why are you here? Why did you protect me even after everything?” The things she has said should’ve been enough to send anyone running for the hills. Why isn’t Rio? Her question makes the raven haired woman smile, a little cocky and sure of herself, and she remembers how much she missed seeing it in the first place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love you.” Rio whispers, strong but soft. They feel inevitable. Her smile only grows wider when Agatha stares in awe. “I have no idea what just happened tonight—I’m completely lost—but I know what I saw, and I know what I heard. So unless I’m totally out of my mind… I think you lo—” Rio doesn’t get to finish even though her voice stays strong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Before thinking, Agatha surges forward. Pain blooms across the cut in her lip but she perseveres. Her hands slip into dark hair, tugging the hair tie from her hair as she pulls the pitcher on top of her. The kiss is fueled by passion and unspoken words, more meaningful than any kiss they’ve shared before.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grunts softly, following the pull of her hair until she is straddling the brunette and deepening the kiss. Rio’s tongue flicks into her mouth then her lip, capturing the small amount of blood on her tongue and moaning. Agatha whimpers. Soft, panting breaths fill the air between them as they part for breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispers quickly until she spots the frown begging to form on soft lips, “I love you, Rio-” Those same lips shut her up and she doesn’t try to speak again. Not when Rio is pressing her into the back of the couch and angling her jaw to kiss her deeper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moved with Rio with practiced ease, shedding layers of tension like old skin, while the silence between them settled deep and deliberate—not awkward, but earned. It held everything: the blackmail that had finally driven Agatha’s mother out of their lives, the whispered plans, the risk, the relief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The apartment was quiet now, the storm long passed, and in that stillness, surrounded by soft lights and the gentle hum of a world that no longer demanded explanation, they found something stronger than victory—they found peace.</span></p>

<p><span>Rio Vidal’s boots clicked sharply against the white marble as she strode across the 50th floor of The Darkhold Tower, home to Harkness Energy. It is a floor she visited often considering the majority of the office space is occupied by her wife, and CEO of Harkness Energy, Agatha Harkness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>After Evanora’s tragic passing, Agatha inherited the family business as promised. Then she promptly moved the Harkness Energy office into the center of Boston, the tallest building with the highest floor, which she later purchased and renamed The Darkhold Tower. Needless to say, the new offices are a little more polished. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“...rescheduling the meeting is a necessity. Mrs.Harkness will be out of the office. Yes, she will return in a week and will be looking forward to meeting with you then.” William Kaplan, Agatha’s devoted young assistant who the CEO so affectionately calls </span><em><span>Teen</span></em><span>, says firmly. Rio smiles as she hears those words. </span><em><span>Out of the office</span></em><span>. It is rare to hear those words in reference to her wife. She has been bargaining with Agatha for a family vacation for the past year. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Of course, as soon as Nicky caught wind of it, Agatha was done for. Their beautiful IVF mix son is kryptonite to Agatha Harkness. Nicolas “Nicky” Gabriel Harkness-Vidal was a blessing in a body that resembled his one mother, Rio Vidal, and the attitude of his other mother, Agatha Harkness. How the doctors managed to mix their DNA so perfectly before implanting the fertilized egg inside of Agatha, they’ll never know. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>William hangs up the phone, immediately typing into his computer for another appointment Agatha will have </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> their vacation. Rio was surprised when Agatha picked him over the gaggle of assistants begging for a spot on her team. He’s an interesting kid; young, a little gothic, a little eccentric but a kind heart. She thought the powerful CEO would’ve crushed his dreams in the first hour of his new position as brunette’s assistant but the boy adapted well. Possibly even as determined and stubborn as Agatha Harkness herself.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio clears her throat, smirking as the young man jumps at her sudden arrival so late into the night. It’s nearly eight o’clock, the sun is setting on the Boston skyline and Rio’s patience. She had foolishly believed the love of her life when the brunette committed to returning home at five o’clock to have dinner and finish packing before leaving early the next morning for their trip. Three hours later and multiple calls fielded by Teen, Rio was done waiting. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mrs.Vidal - Dr.Vidal.” William plasters a smile on his face, not fake but certainly trying to persuade the older woman not to yell at him. Rio wouldn’t. She knows the true reason William continued to brush off her calls. Agatha Harkness is a strict and unapologetic boss - and stubborn. She would keep William here until near Midnight if the business was hitting even the smallest speed bump. She was determined and unrelenting, something he wife admired, but she also refuses to acknowledge when she needs to quit. Which in Agatha’s mind is never. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was just-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go home William,” Rio says calmly, keeping her voice quiet to keep her presence unknown to the brunette through the opaque doors. She did come uninvited after all. Why ruin the surprise?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“B-But Mrs.Harkness told me-” He doesn’t get to finish. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio interrupts him swiftly, “I like you, William.” A small terrified but pleased smile crosses his face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, thanks.” William mutters softly. Rio smiles, somehow threateningly, and leans forward with two hands planted on his desk. The young man swallows roughly as he stares in unfiltered concern and fear. Rio likes knowing she can still bring that out in some people. Not nearly as much as her counterpart can but still. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My wife was supposed to be home three hours ago,” Rio begins, nodding calmly when William nods in agreement, “</span><em><span>You</span></em><span> told me she would be home </span><em><span>three hours ago</span></em><span>.” Now he looks guilty despite the call to stay so late, ultimately falling on Agatha’s shoulders. Rio reaches out and slowly closes the laptop between herself and the young assistant. He opens his mouth, almost to argue, but promptly closes his mouth when the older woman drills him with a look that makes his hands shake. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go. Home.” Rio whispers. William quickly nods his head and starts to gather his things into his tasteful ‘Casting Spells, Not Vibes’ tote bag. He turns left instead of right, making towards Agatha’s office but Rio steps into his way. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, ah, ah,” Rio makes a twirling motion with her finger, “I’ll let her know you’ve been relieved of your duties. Off to your monthly witch gathering, little Wiccan.” William’s eyes bug out of his head, wanting to protest, but currently the woman in front of him creates a wall he won’t be getting through. William finally turns around with a defeated look and mutters about ‘witch gatherings’ as he walks towards the elevators. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio takes a breath and spins on her heel to look at the closed opaque doors where her wife sits on the other side. She pushes into the office to see Agatha working diligently at her desk. The cap of a red pen sits between her teeth and the counterpart of the cap scrawling angrily across the packet sitting open on the desk. Her other hand holds her head up, brown waves falling over her shoulders, brow furrowed into a crease as blue eyes flitter over whatever she seems to be so immersed in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is wearing a sheer black blouse, just barely containing the lace black bra underneath, un-buttoned at the top, leaving anyone who looks wanting more. The deep plum, satin, mid thigh pencil skirt is no different with a slit running daringly high up her thigh. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio feels her chest hurt with how beautiful she looks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought I told you to leave me alone Teen.” Agatha grumbles lowly, a threat, scribbling harshly at something she dislikes. Rio smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I relieved William of his duties for the night, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes jump up at the all too familiar voice. Rio Vidal, dressed in well fitted black slacks, heeled boots and a loose green silk blouse, is standing in her doorway. </span><em><span>Not</span></em><span> her traitorous little assistant who let the woman in. She makes a mental note to pile on the work when she returns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Nonetheless, the sight of her wife is one for sore eyes. Agatha doesn’t know how long she’s been staring at this new business contract, one written up to absorb the other energy business that has tried encroaching on her territory, but apparently it has been long enough if Rio has been forced to retrieve her. In the back of her mind, she knew she had passed her departure time. Teen had reminded her at least three times before she snapped at him to stay out of her office until she was done with the contract. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not done with my work yet.” Agatha says stubbornly, eyes jumping back to the last page in front of her. </span><em><span>Just one more page</span></em><span>. Rio rolls her eyes and begins stalking forward, very slowly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit,” Agatha glares but it only makes the raven haired woman smile wider, “I just came to…</span><em><span>keep you company</span></em><span>.” Rio rounds the desk until she stands to the side of her wife. Agatha is suspicious, stopping her crimson scrawls to raise her head and look up at the other woman with a narrow of curiosity in her eyes. Something must be wrong. Rio should be mad at her, shouldn’t she? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A gentle, strong hand glides soft finger tips up her neck to settle delicately under her chin. Agatha closes her eyes as lips, just as soft as Rio’s touch, gently presses to her own. A sense of serenity washes through her. Every muscle relaxes and she becomes all too pliant. Agatha had been working too hard for too long and only Rio knows just how to unravel her when she gets like this.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>But she is stubborn. So when Rio pulls away, Agatha uses everyone bone in her body to look back down at the document on her desk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is surprised. Usually a kiss works, then another and another, but not tonight. It’s not unheard of. Agatha is trying to preserve the company while she is gone even if it is in semi-capable hands when she leaves. A week-long vacation is putting more stress and strain onto the CEO. Rio can appreciate why, but that doesn’t mean she won’t try everything in her power to help. She did prepare for the worst and hope for the best but…she’ll just have to do her worst. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve been working so hard.” Rio acknowledges as she steps to stand behind the CEO’s chair, gently guiding the woman to lean back into the plush leather. Agatha opened her mouth, even wet her lips, ready to respond when evil, devilish, strong fingers dug into the tight muscles of her shoulders. She just barely stops a moan from ringing throughout the office. She clamps down onto her bottom lip and breathes deeply through her nose. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m just here to show my appreciation,” Rio whispers innocently. </span><em><span>As if</span></em><span>. Agatha should stop her, fight her off until she has finished the last of her review but- </span><em><span>God, her hands feel so good.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha cranes her head to the left a little, “A little higher, sweetheart.” The brunette mutters quickly, keeping the absolute pleasure from her voice as much as she can. Rio hums softly, a smirk burning through the noise, but does as she is told, playing along. She swipes curly hair to the other shoulder, making sure her blunt nails scratch at the back of Agatha’s neck to see her shiver, and digs her practiced fingers into the tense muscle. She waits to see teeth biting into a supple bottom lip before leaning forward so her mouth is beside her wife’s ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like that?” Rio husks, dropping her voice just enough, pulling a whisper of a moan from the CEO. Agatha doesn’t respond, or rather can’t because otherwise a much louder moan will escape her, and </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> will be losing. Instead, she grips the red pen tighter and tries to focus on the contract. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio isn’t undeterred. “You’re so tense, baby.” She drops her left hand down the brunette’s chest as her right hand makes easy work of turning the tense muscles of her wife’s neck into jelly. Agatha can’t stop her eyes from nearly fluttering shut just as she can’t stop deft fingers from popping open the buttons on her blouse. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Oh…so that is where this is going?</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha expected some teasing but nothing too intense. It seems Rio has a different plan. A well thought out and mind numbingly delicious plan. Agatha is finding it hard to oppose.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ever since their businesses took off and Nicky came into their lives, intimacy has been fleeting. They still dedicate their time to being with one another, even for a little while. They’ve had plenty of quickies, early in the morning or late at night. They’ve made out in the back of Agatha’s luxury town car on the way to lunch once or twice. They’ve connected - they </span><em><span>are </span></em><span>connected. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>But when was the last time they’ve actually explored one another? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is in the middle of trying to answer that question when Rio’s warm palm slides across her chest and under her bra, cupping her breast gently. A soft groan sneaks past her pitiful line of defense. She doesn’t even have to look to see a blinding, cocky smirk on her wife’s lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Knowing fingers pinch her nipple into a peak, begging for more attention. The hand Agatha isn’t using to strangle her red pen drops down to grab the leather clad armrest with white knuckles. One particularly rough pinch of her nipple and massage of the last tense muscle in her neck has an unrestrained moan breaking through her defenses, eyes fluttering closed and her chest arcing for more attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Heat flushes through both of them, “That’s it, baby. Just relax.” Rio coos softly, unable to keep the lust at bay any longer, her voice dropping an octave just from the sight of her wife caving to her touch. She abandons the massage and takes up the task of unbuttoning the rest of her blouse with one hand. She doesn’t pull apart the sheer material but rather enjoys the way it frames the beauty in front of her like a painting on display. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha Harkness, eyes shut, plum painted lips parted, rosy flushed cheeks and gripping the pen like her life line. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gorgeous,” Rio husks, shamelessly using both hands to fondle the lace covered breasts in front of her. Agatha breathes out harshly through her nose and abandons the pen as the pure reverence in Rio’s words punch her right in the chest. </span><em><span>She can finish the contract later</span></em><span>. Her thighs squeeze together and a moan glides past her lips when a warm, wet mouth latches onto her neck. Despite the lust and angst swirling between them, encasing them in lavender and bergamot, Rio takes her time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re teasing.” Agatha hisses after some time, each pinch and roll of her nipples sending shockwaves through her body to land home between her thighs. The poor lace thong will be soaked through by now. Rio has a wonderful habit of making sure of that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio chuckles, dark and thick with arousal, “I’m taking my time, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>. I am simply </span><em><span>appreciating</span></em><span> the beauty in front of me.” Agatha is seconds from biting back, impatient and throbbing, but one teasing hand leaves her breast to skate up her neck and grab her jaw. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It isn’t a rough grip, not even close to what is capable, but it leaves no room for disobedience when Rio leads the brunette’s head to tip backwards. It’s an awkward angle, Agatha has to arch her back even more toward the hand on her chest just to comply with the raven haired woman’s hold, but in the end she can look up through her lashes to see her wife. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her dark eyed, devilish looking wife who has a glinting promise in her eyes - a promise of ruin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha swallows roughly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s the least you can allow me to do,” Rio whispers softly, dropping her lips to her wife’s in a quick kiss, “since you left me waiting.” Agatha feels a little guilty, at first - she really does, but…it’s brought them </span><em><span>here</span></em><span> and she doesn’t exactly see a problem with that so she doesn’t feel all too guilty. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio kisses her again, deeper and slower, making sure her wife stays still before letting her hand drop back down to play with the delectable breasts in front of her. Their tongues wrestle and tease, soft breath and moans filling each part of their lips. By the time Rio has pulled back, Agatha is nearly buzzing in her chair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Pull your skirt up.” Not down.</span><em><span> Up</span></em><span>. Agatha moans softly, leaning up to catch Rio’s smirking lips one more time while she grabs the hem of her skirt and tugs. The skirt is expensive but her concern is lacking when Rio demands like she does. Rio pulls back from the kiss to see Agatha's bare thighs and drenched plum thong. She hums deep in her chest, obviously pleased, and places a gentle kiss on her wife's temple.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good. Now spread your legs. Put them on the armrests so I can see you.” Agatha's brain malfunctions for a second. Rio smirks, patiently waiting for the brunette to comply. A few seconds pass before Agatha manages to follow the demand - with Rio’s help, of course. Both legs are spread open and held there by the arm rests of her leather office chair. Her heart beats out of her chest in anticipation. It's been a while since Rio had caught her so off guard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good girl,” Rio whispers into her ear. Agatha holds back a whine. Rio wastes no time giving a parting squeeze to the breast in her right hand then dropping it down to the pretty lace thong waiting for her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, you look so good spread open for me.” Rio whispers, dragging her finger tips across wet lace but specifically avoiding the brunette’s aching clit. Agatha's breath catches in her chest when the raven haired demon behind her slides her fingers underneath the lace, keeping the material in place, yet rubbing her knuckles of her fingers over her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>God</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha whispers with a moan, careful not to buck her hips in fear of her legs falling down. But she needs more. Rio smiles, continuously pinching and rolling the nipple between the fingers of her left hand while her right tugs the thong aside. Nothing, not time or space, could take away from the beauty that is Agatha Harkness spread open for her. Her mouth waters at the sight of her dripping pussy but she keeps her lust in check. Rio has plans. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Deft fingers drag through Agatha’s wetness, gathering the arousal with ease, “I’m going to make you come - just like this.” Rio mutters softly, licking at the skin of her neck to taste </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> while she hatches her plan. Agatha nods her head, wondering what in the hell her wife cooked up in that beautiful brain of hers, happy to follow along. </span><em><span>For now</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A moan creeps from Agatha’s throat at the first touch of Rio’s fingers circling her clit. Exactly how she likes, fast and hard, catching the throbbing bud at every pass. It makes the brunette delirious with lust, trembling even, for more contact. It takes everything she has to stay still. It doesn’t take long for her lust to turn into something deeper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha swallows roughly and licks her lips between panting breaths, “Need you inside me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio could die right there. Instead she moans, deep and rumbling in her chest, as she abides by the request, dropping one finger lower to tease the brunette’s entrance. Another moan leaks past her lips but this time it is muffled by soft skin as she nips at Agatha’s neck, one finger sinking inside of her wife. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>No amount of time could change this woman. Rio has muttered the words of whitcraft and sorcery in reference to her wife because the CEO hasn’t aged a fucking day, not in ten years - not even twenty. Rio’s finger slides in with ease, everything surrounding the digit wet, tight and hot. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gasps softly, arching against the leather and closing her eyes. It’s not enough to fill her but Rio doesn’t seem to be in a withholding mood so she doesn’t worry. Her wife is simply appreciating her - </span><em><span>worshipping</span></em><span>. Like Agatha is the altar in her church. It’s always nice to see the raven haired woman on her knees, preparing for a feast Agatha is more than happy to spread out for her. So, she misses the view, but this will do just fine too. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio licks the skin she has bruised, making a mental note to pack concealer, “So good for me, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>. Stay still while I fuck you.” She diverts her eyes back to the beautiful junction of soft, toned thighs before adding a second finger. The brunette nearly loses her legs but quickly saves herself by bringing her red bottomed heels to the edge of the glass desk. It makes Rio smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What I wouldn’t do to have a picture of you right now.” Rio picks up the pace of her fingers, listening closely to hear the sound of her fingers plunging into her wife’s arousal. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hums softly, a lazy smile crossing her lips, “You’d like that, wouldn’t you sweetheart? Save it to your secret folder to put to use later?” She responds softly, breathless, and opening her eyes to see the masterpiece of strong fingers fucking into her with such sure, rhythmic strokes. </span><em><span>Yeah, she wouldn’t mind having a picture of this either</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She knows for a fact, Rio has a password protected folder on her phone of various lewd and compromising pictures of herself and Agatha. She has her own folder after all. There have been too many business trips between the two of them not to keep the pictures they’ve sent. All of them very tasteful and avoiding a full face of either one of them in case of a leak, but enough to know. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know me so well.” Rio moans softly, taking the brunette’s earlobe into her mouth and nipping at the soft skin to hear her breath catch. “How am I to live without picturing you, </span><em><span>mi esposa</span></em><span>?” </span><em><span>My wife</span></em><span>. Agatha could hear those words every day for the rest of her life, never be called anything else by the other woman, and she would be the happiest woman on the planet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nevertheless,” Rio begins, slowing her fingers down for a fraction of a second, much to Agatha’s displeasure, “Neither my imagination or my pictures could capture the true beauty of you like this.” Three fingers slide inside of Agatha’s pussy, the arousal already coating Rio’s hand makes the addition easy but the way the silky muscles clamp around her fingers makes the intrusion tighter than ever. They both moan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh God</span></em><span> - Rio, don’t stop.” Agatha hissed. Having her heels propped up gives her enough leverage to buck her hips just a little, taking Rio’s fingers down to the knuckles every time. She is close, moaning and cursing under her breath as her orgasm races toward her. Rio doesn’t let up, pushing her palm flat against the brunette’s clit and curling her fingers, begging the orgasm to come faster. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck, fuck, fuck, f-</span></em><span>” Agatha loses herself, coming on her wife’s fingers and nearly arching out of the chair as she does. Her thighs shake, her fingers dig into the arm rest and her feet push against the edge of the desk so hard the rolling chair shifts backwards only a centimeter before hitting the wall of a woman standing solidly behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio holds her close, pins her shoulders against the chair and pumps her fingers as much as she can with the new position. She takes her time bringing the CEO back down to earth, nibbling at her neck and grinding her palm against her clit until she jerks with the after shocks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, Rio.” Agatha groans, finally reaching down to stop her wife’s hand from fucking her further. She can sense the smug smile without even looking behind her. The fingers slowly pull out of her, leaving her empty and hungry for more. Rio brings her wet fingers to her own mouth, relieved to finally get a taste of the other woman. Agatha places her feet back onto the floor with shaking legs, taking a deep breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She moans and pops the fingers from her mouth just to whisper, “You don’t think we’re done yet, do you?” Agatha smiles and shakes her head. </span><em><span>She should’ve known.</span></em><span> Rio doesn’t do anything half-assed and this is no exception. Rio straightens up and pulls Agatha’s chair back from the desk to step between it and her wife. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>. I have a surprise for you.” Rio smiles sweetly even though her eyes ravage the brunette with a sinful glint, offering her hand. Agatha smiles back, taking a second to look at her wife who looks otherwise unaffected if it weren’t for the blown pupils of her eyes. She takes the offered hand and stands on briefly wobbling legs, stumbling into her wife.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Careful,” Rio chastises, holding the brunette closer with an arm wrapped around her waist. She leans down, taking her lips but Agatha is smiling instead. She raises an eyebrow but the brunette simply trails her fingers down Rio’s silk shirt until she reaches her slacks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is this my surprise…” Agatha whispers, cupping the bulge under the slacks with a firm hand, Rio’s eyes darkening further as her breath catches, “or are you just happy to see me?” The brunette bites into her bottom lip as she smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio breathes in sharply through her nose, trying to reign herself in, and smiles mischievously, “Why not both?” She watches the CEO’s smile widen so far the bottom lip between her teeth pop free. Though the hand at the front of her pants doesn't stop. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It takes one rub, targeted and slow, to get the dildo pressing into her throbbing clit just right. Rio’s fingers tighten at Agatha’s hip, gripping the bunched up material of her skirt as her hips twitch forward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t let up, pressing closer and dropping her lips to the raven haired woman’s neck. Her free hand makes quick work of the button and zipper restricting the toy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh</span></em><span>,” Agatha releases a playful gasp as soon she catches sight of the dildo, her hand letting the deep purple soft silicone protrude from the black slacks, “This is new.” The brunette whispers in excitement, anticipation glinting in her eyes, as she wraps her hand around the toy. It is slightly larger in girth than Agatha is used to but she’ll be damned if she says no to it right now. She’s so wet and turned on she could take anything Rio had brought. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans softly, “I </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> wanted to surprise you.” She smirks, a little confident and smug. But she makes the mistake of looking down at the way Agatha’s hand slowly begins jerking off the cock. “</span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>,” she mutters in awe, the smirk still on her face. Pleasure slithered down her spine, curling tight in her gut and unraveling every trace of her original plan.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha loves that smirk as much as she loves her wife but she will enjoy wiping it off her face more than you could imagine. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It doesn’t take long. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The CEO mutters something about </span><em><span>taking a closer look</span></em><span> before dropping to her knees directly in front of her wife while keeping direct eye contact. Rio doesn’t believe her eyes, her knees going weak as her lips part in a shocked, quiet gasp. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hums softly in contemplation as she studies the toy, “You’re so </span><em><span>big</span></em><span>, sweetheart.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is going to die. Legitimately keel over and expire right here in Agatha’s office. She supposes it’s only fitting for the brunette to be the one to deliver her demise. The hand on the dildo still works the toy into a slow grind against her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure I can take you?” Agatha husks, her free hand drifting up to scratch lightly at the toned stomach above her, muscles twitching and hips jumping in response. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The other woman looks downright </span><em><span>satanic</span></em><span>. Black holes where her irises used to be, a dangerously aroused glint flickering with anticipation, watching intensely. Bottom lip caught between her teeth so hard she briefly fears for it, waiting for blood. The hands at her sides clenched into fists so tight her knuckles are white. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe you should’ve used four fingers?” Agatha wonders aloud simply to taunt Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans softly, finally snapping out of her trance enough to respond, “Mmm, no.” She whispers, reaching out to run her fingers through brunette locks as she continues watching. “I want you to feel every inch of me.” Agatha’s heart jumps in her chest out of pure excitement, a smile crossing her lips, she nearly stands up and bends herself over the desk. But, no, she has an idea she wants to fulfill. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha leans forward, her lips pursing and placing a delicate and slow kiss to the tip of the dildo. Rio feels like she’s going to strain a hip muscle with how hard she is restraining herself from bucking forward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does that mean I shouldn’t help you get ready for me?” Agatha asks curiously, tilting her head innocently as if the question doesn’t make fire rip through Rio’s veins. It had taken a few seconds for her brain to catch up to the implication but as soon as it came through her fingers were twitching in Agatha’s hair. A desperate need for the image in her mind to come to fruition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The CEO raises an eyebrow, pushing her hand down to the base of the dildo and keeping it there to lead it to her mouth. She hasn’t done </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> in a long time. Rio has never asked for it but Agatha knows she enjoys it. It doesn’t matter that Rio can’t feel anything, the sight alone has its way of unraveling her. It never takes the raven haired woman long to pull her from her knees and fuck her with the dildo that was formerly wrapped around her lips - usually refusing to stop until the brunette is begging for a break. She loves it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>So, Agatha makes sure her wife’s eyes are locked on her when she leans forward to take the silicone into her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck, Agatha</span></em><span>,” Rio grits out, reaching out to grip the glass surface of the desk. “I</span><em><span> need</span></em><span> to fuck you.” Her eyes are unable to look away, watching with heaving breaths while her heart beats out of her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hums softly, pulling back from the dildo as her hand takes over once again. She would love nothing more than to let Rio dictate when they move forward but she has other plans in mind. She’s never made Rio come by using her mouth on the dildo like this and it’s about high time she changed that.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her free hand tugs at the woman’s slacks as she takes the dildo back into her mouth. Rio groans, oblivious to anything other than the mouth working the dildo against her clit. She is seconds from reaching down when the hands she wasn’t paying attention to make themselves very well known. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So wet for me,” Agatha whispers when she pulls back. Her hands have tugged at the slacks enough to lower them below the toy, the lack of clothing allowing her hand access to the heat between Rio’s thighs. No underwear. Her wife came prepared. Agatha should reward her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Jesus</span></em> <em><span>fucking Christ</span></em><span>,” Rio gasps out with a moan. She automatically spreads her legs to a wider stance, making the brunette’s hand slide to her cunt without restriction. The dildo is new but it is similar to one they have used before where the wearer has an insert. There may be an insert but that doesn’t seem to stop the CEO. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha uses one finger to slide inside of Rio right behind the insert. Brown eyes roll back as a dark haired head drops back onto strong shoulders, an unrestrained moan ringing through the office. Agatha smiles at the sight, committing it to memory before taking the dildo back into her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha- </span><em><span>oh, fuck</span></em><span>.” Rio whimpers, helplessly bucking her hips when she looks back down to the sight in front of her. The devious look in blue eyes makes her crumble. She keeps her hips as still as she can to avoid pushing the dildo down Agatha’s throat. Not that the brunette doesn’t try her damndest to take the whole thing. It’s difficult to say the least. Especially when the finger inside of her thrusts and curls to rock the insert in time with her thrusts and mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels her eyes beginning to water just as Rio reaches down to slide her fingers into her hair. It isn’t to control her movement but to simply hold her close, to connect. She won’t be pulling back now. She glances up, seeing the little telltale sign in her furrowed brow that the raven haired woman is getting close to her climax. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mi amour</span></em><span>, please. Let me fuck you. I need you.” Rio moans breathlessly, her hips itching to push forward. What she wouldn’t do to be buried inside of her wife’s cunt right now. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nuh uh,” Agatha says roughly, her throat raspy as she licks her lips, picking up the pace of both hands. Rio’s eyes widen and snap down before scrunching in confusion. The brunette smirks. “You’re going to come just like this. Aren’t you, sweetheart? You’re so close.” Agatha coos sweetly, enticing the raven haired woman into bucking into her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh God,” Rio nods her head as she speaks, hurtling toward her orgasm with increasing speed, “Yes, fuck. Yes. I’m so fucking close.” The plan of fucking her wife into the desk was pushed out of her mind as soo as the brunette had demanded her own plan into action. The dual sensation is nothing short of euphoric. Agatha moans at the admission, slipping a second finger inside of her wife just to see her eyes roll back in her head once more, to feel the stretch around her fingers and the insert. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come for me, Rio.” Agatha husks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Like a snap of her fingers was all that was needed to send Rio over the edge. Agatha watches, staring at her wife and drinking in her pleasure like it was her own. Rio was beyond this world, shaking and moaning. Knees so weak, she had to actually put the hand anchored on the desk to use. Agatha waits for the clenching around her fingers to cease before slowly retreating from the raven haired woman. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everytime I think I’ve got you pinned down…” Rio mutters breathlessly, still gathering herself as she shakes her head, finally looking back down at the brunette. Agatha chuckles softly and uses Rio’s offered hand to help her stand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve got to keep you guessing,” Agatha responds swiftly, catching the other woman’s lips with a soft hum. “Otherwise, this wouldn’t be twice as fun.” Rio smiles, using both hands on her wife’s cheeks to pull her into a kiss. She pours herself into the woman, neither one of them breaking the kiss for anything other than a quick breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turns them, pushing Agatha’s ass into the glass edge of her desk and pressing herself flush against her, hands roaming and touching warm skin wherever she can reach. She doesn’t know how they went so long without being like this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve missed you,” Rio whispers when they finally break apart. She presses her forehead against Agatha’s with a sigh, her hands dropping lower and lower until she can pull at the ruined thong. The CEO smiles and helps shimmy the lace down her legs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve missed you too,” Agatha kicks the thong aside and begins pushing the bunched up skirt down to join it but she doesn’t get far. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio uses strong hands to spin her around to face the desk, “this stays on.” The command sends heat rushing through the brunette’s body. She doesn’t fight her. It’s obvious Rio has a plan and for once Agatha can’t think of a single reason to go off script. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>So, she plays into it, “</span><em><span>Yes, ma’am</span></em><span>.” Agatha drawls playfully, seductive and teasing, as she bends over the glass desk with hands planted carefully over the documents she was reviewing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio releases a soft little laugh of amusement. “Cute,” Rio husks mockingly and uses one hand to press between the brunette’s shoulder blades, pressing her wife flush against the glass desk with total disregard for the papers strewn across it. Agatha smiles smugly and attempts to shift the papers out from underneath her for all of two seconds before she gives up. She’ll deal with it in a week.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio uses a hand to lead toned legs into a wider spread. Rio can’t help herself, she leans back and admires the view for a few seconds before reaching out to touch. Her fingers run through the mess of Agatha’s dripping wet pussy, circling her clit until she hears a moan then dragging her fingers back to her entrance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You wanted four fingers, hmm?” Rio asks, easily pushing three fingers into her wife. Agatha groans at the initial stretch then pushes back. Accepting every inch of her fingers on every thrust but it isn’t enough.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I just want your cock, sweetheart.” Agatha breathes out, arching her spine and glancing over her shoulder with a smirk. “Be a good girl and give it to me.” It doesn’t surprise her to see brown eyes dropping shades to black as those eyes flick up to her face. A small tilt of Rio’s head is the only indication she gets that her challenge has been accepted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Fingers leave her cunt and the dildo replaces them at her entrance, teasing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t even know what you’re asking for, </span><em><span>mi esposa</span></em><span>.” Rio anchors a hand at her wife’s hips as she readies her stance, making sure her eyes are still locked on Agatha’s face. “I will have you begging and shaking on my cock long before I am through with you.” She reaches into her right pocket, pulling out a small bottle of lube and pouring a generous amount onto the dildo. She leans forward, making sure to keep her hips back, only teasing the brunette with the tip of her cock. The hand planted in between strong shoulders slides up to tangle in brown hair for a demanding grip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans softly, taking those words for what they are, a promise, and lifting her head as the hand in her hair pulls. Devilish lips come to her ear, panting soft breath over her skin. She attempts to push back to take the toy inside of her but her wife’s grip is as bruising as ever and pushes her forward into the desk. The glass bites into her skin, sure to leave a confusing bruise alongside the fingertips at her hip. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Te voy a arruinar mi amor y disfrutaré cada segundo,</span></em><span>” </span><em><span>I am going to ruin you, my love, and I will enjoy every second,</span></em><span> Rio whispers darkly. A shiver runs through Agatha’s entire body. She’s learned a lot of Spanish over the years. Her pronunciations struggle but her comprehension of the words spoken to her have become as easy as English. That fact alone is enough for Rio to speak filthy Spanish nonsense into her ear with the most seductive voice she can muster. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t want a response that extends beyond </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>, so she pushes her hips forward. Agatha’s breath catches in her chest and her eyes roll back in her head with a loud moan ripping from her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Fuck me</span></em><span>,” Agatha hisses, the sensations bombarding her makes her knees weak. The stretch burns deep, every centimeter feeling like the dildo will tear her apart in the best way. Her teeth biting into her bottom lip and her body begging to sag onto the desk. But her wife keeps her head back, keeping her mouth just close enough to her ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re right baby. You’re so fucking tight for me. Does it feel good?” Rio smiles when Agatha’s breath hitches and a moan is quick to follow, she sneaks the hand once holding her hip down to circle her clit. “Tell me baby. Can you feel every inch of me now?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha gasps out, “</span><em><span>God</span></em><span> - yes, Rio. You feel so fucking big.” The brunette admits, delirious with the stretch coupled with the fingers strumming her clit. Rio groans softly, digesting the words with increasing heat. It takes a few more seconds until her hips are flush with her wife’s ass. She places a gentle kiss to her sweat slicked temple and leans backwards, removing the hand from her hair to rub gentle circles at the small of her back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look at you,” Rio murmurs in awe, “Taking my entire cock in your beautiful pussy so fucking well.” She shakes her head, burning the image into her mind. When she first bought the strap on a few weeks ago she wasn’t sure if Agatha would be able to take it. But </span><em><span>damn</span></em><span> does she take every inch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>,” Agatha breathes softly, a little whiny. She had collapsed into a damn near puddle on top of the desk as soon as Rio had released her hair. Her hips twitch with want when the brunette continues to circle her clit with gentle circles, matching the pattern on the small of her back. It eases the pleasurable ache inside of her with every move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give me a color, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>.” Rio requests swiftly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Green. So fucking green, my love.” Agatha reassures quickly, finally wanting to move. “So big. I just need-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More?” Rio guesses with a smirk. “Greedy girl. You need to be fucked so badly. Spread out and bent over your desk just desperate to take everything I’m going to give you.” If it’s possible, Agatha melts further into the desk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Give it to me, Rio. Don’t tease - Don’t make me wait.” Agatha spreads her legs wider and glances over her shoulder to watch her wife. Rio nods immediately, refusing to deny her anything at this point. She gently, slowly pulls out until only half of the cock is sheathed in Agatha’s tight cunt before pushing forward again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Jesus</span></em><span>,” Agatha groans, pushing back to take more. “You feel so good.” Rio echoes her groan, dropping her hand from the small of her back over to her hip to control their movements a little more. The insert inside of her moves with the thrusts and curls into that delicious spot inside of her. Not to mention the friction of the base against her clit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans loudly, “Me? Your pussy is heaven on earth </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>. I don’t know how I’ve gone so long without feeling you like this.” It’s true, her heart aches at how far apart they've spent their time. How little time they’ve had to themselves these days. Something to rectify after tonight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Never again.” Agatha agrees quickly, pushing back harder and faster. Rio matches her thrust for thrust. The spacious office fills with the delicious, obscene sounds of their wetness and sweaty skin connecting with every move. It doesn’t take long for Agatha to feel her orgasm coiling tightly in her gut, walls clenching around the large toy inside of her. Rio grunts like she can feel it. Agatha hopes she can. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m gonna come, my love.”  Agatha murmurs, pressing her forehead into the glass below her, her hot breath fogging the surface. She reaches up to grip the edge of the desk to anchor herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come as much as you want,” Rio says breathlessly, her hips moving faster as her fingers match pace. “I won’t be stopping. I have another surprise for you. I have a feeling it’ll be hard for you to hold off afterwards.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha barely holds herself together to hear the words let alone understand them. But it doesn’t matter. She doesn’t register anything but the pleasure racing through her. “</span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, Rio, I’m coming. Don’t fucking stop. You feel so good sweetheart- </span><em><span>yes!</span></em><span>” The wave of her orgasm sends her into a spiral. Nothing but the cock thrusting into her and the fingers at her clit make sense. She is wrecked. Her hands try to claw at the glass and her hips continue to be pummeled forward from the woman behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s it, baby. Good job,” Rio whispers, slowing her thrusts and pulling her hand away from her wife’s clit to run her fingers up her spine, leaning forward with the stretch. Agatha takes a few deep breaths, enjoying the wandering lips scattering kisses across her shoulders while she recovers, and smiles when the raven haired woman starts becoming impatient, nipping at her skin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you ready for the other part of your surprise?” Rio asks softly, sliding her hands underneath the body below her to take a handful of each breast. Agatha moans and arches into the touch, finally getting her arms back up underneath her to prop herself up onto her elbows. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not sure what else you could surprise me with, wife.” Agatha admits with a smirk, pushing back onto the cock still buried inside her. Rio chuckles lightly, indulging her wife and beginning with slow thrusts. She gently pulls her hands away, keeping one hand on the brunette’s hip as she reaches into her pocket. It is a small metal remote, just big enough for three buttons. She presses the first one and-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“-</span><em><span>jesus! What the fuck-</span></em><span>” Agatha gasps out a moan, toes curling in her heels and fingers wrapping around the edge of the desk. Rio smiles, her own hips jumping from the vibrations running through the dildo to the base pressing against her clit, but she had been expecting it. Agatha feels her cunt clench harshly around the dildo on the next thrust, vibrations hitting her directly in the center of her core. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio moans as she picks up the pace, “How’s that feel pretty girl?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Even now, after all this time, Rio still manages to make Agatha blush. “So fucking good.” She feels Rio’s hand return to her hips before moving again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>A deep, guttural groan breaks free from her throat when those hands find leverage in the material still bunched around her waist. She thought the visual was enticing for her wife, she didn’t expect her to use the skirt as a prop to fucking her. Not that she minds. The fact alone has her crying out and hurtling towards her second orgasm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans as the new grip lets her hips plunge deeper and faster. “Holy shit,” Rio gasps, leaning back slightly as the new angle rubs across her clit just right. Her brow furrows and her eyes threaten to close but she keeps them open to watch the sinful view in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I can’t stop. I-I’m gonna come.” Agatha shakes, her body dropping back down to the desk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The raven haired woman doesn’t let up, “Good job, baby, give it to me. Come all over my cock. Just sit still and look pretty while I fuck your greedy pussy until I’l done with you.” She pants out harshly, thrusting deeper and smiling deviously when a damn near scream rips from her wife’s throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha feels broken. The harsh thrusts, the vibrations, the dirty words of encouragement. She was a goner the second her wife walked in here she just didn’t know it until now. Her eyes roll back in her head as her orgasm rushes through her. Her knees go weak and Rio has no choice but to release her hold on the skirt to hold her weight by using an arm around her waist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Easy,” Rio whispers, using one hand to lead Agatha’s right knee onto the desk so the furniture can take her weight instead of her shaking legs and Rio’s grip. It works, Agatha’s muscles turn to jell-o. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio takes a deep breath, looking down at her wife. Agatha Harkness, spread and bent over her own desk as she takes the largest strap on they have without so much as a thought against it. Rio loves her so god damn much.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m </span><em><span>obsessed</span></em><span> with you, </span><em><span>mi esposa</span></em><span>,” Rio husks passionately, reaching into her pocket and briefly turning off the vibrations. Agatha groans, a small smile crossing her lips as she catches her breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t say.” It sends them both into a light laugh. Rio readjusts her stance, leaning forward and planting kisses along every inch of skin she can reach. One hand slips down in front of the brunette to circle her clit. “Fuck, Rio, anymore and I won’t be able to walk out of here.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio hums softly, “Just one more.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hard to resist when you fuck me like that- </span><em><span>christ</span></em><span>.” Agatha moans and shifts her hips back to take more of the dildo. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s my girl,” Rio whispers with a smile. She snags the remote once more and turns on the vibrator to a high setting as she sets the pace. Agatha gasps, hips stuttering as they move back and forth on the cock, knowing it won’t take her long. Rio feels her own orgasm racing down her spine and enjoys every second leading up to it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Feels so good, Agatha. Come here - lemme see you.” Rio reaches forward and takes the brunette’s jaw in her hand to turn her head. Agatha pushes up to her arms and arches her back to meet her lips with a hungry moan swallowed by her wife. She can feel the desperate way the raven haired woman’s hips are chasing her orgasm and ends the kiss with a mischievous smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does it feel good to fuck me, sweetheart? Your big cock stretching me out and fucking me senseless,” Agatha husks softly against her lips. Rio groans, the heat coiling in her gut with a vengeance, her hand tightening on Agatha’s jaw in a gentle warning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t play with me.” Rio hisses, her eyes drilling into blue. Agatha simply smiles and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Now why would I do that? It’s no fun.” Agatha grabs the hand at her jaw and jerks it down between her thighs. Rio complies, rubbing harsh circles into the brunette’s clit as she picks up the pace. The movement gains so much momentum the desk begins to rock. Agatha is seconds from slowing them down when the vibrations ratchet up higher. She nearly curls in on herself at the feeling. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re right. That’s no fun.” Rio grunts back, sinking her teeth into Agatha’s shoulder. The CEO cries out, shaking and clenching already. God, it has been too long. Rio takes one hand free from her hip and cups her breast in one hand to pinch and twist her nipple. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Motherfucker</span></em><span>,” Agatha gasps out, her head dropping backward toward her wife. “Don’t stop. Right there. I’m gonna come all over your cock, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>.” Rio curls forward, trying to get as flush as she can, hips stuttering at every other move. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Their movements are nothing short of </span><em><span>feral</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Raw. Animalistic</span></em><span>. The list goes on and on. Neither of them will be satisfied until they break. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Mierda</span></em><span>,” </span><em><span>Fuck,</span></em><span> Rio hisses, licking at the bite before sucking on her wife’s skin to create a mark, “You’re gonna make me come, Agatha. Come on. Come with me, please, baby.” Rio requests hopefully, panting for breath as her cunt begins clenching around the insert. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha starts muttering every expletive in the book, even a few Spanish ones Rio had taught her. One hand comes up to cover her wife’s on her chest, interlacing their fingers and squeezing with her as their orgasms collapse over them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Heat surges through them. Agatha collapses forwards and subsequently brings her wife with her. Rio’s sensitive clit has no choice but to buck and grind against the base. Together they shake and tremble in their orgasms, holding on to each other as much as the position allows.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holy fuck- Rio, turn it off. If I come again I’ll pass out.” Agatha hisses, shaking and twitching on her wife’s cock like she’s two seconds from a fourth orgasm. Rio breathes out a soft laugh but relents, pressing the button to turn off the vibrations in the cock. A sigh leaves both of them with relief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where the hell did you find that thing?” Agatha groans when Rio begins to pull out, her pussy clamping around the toy as it goes. Rio takes a deep breath and looks down at the mess coating the dildo and the front of her slacks, a smile gracing her lips at the sight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grabs a few tissues from the desk, “Custom made toy from our favorite site.” She uses the tissue to wipe the mess from Agatha’s thighs and pussy while she rests. “Once I told them the amount of their toys that we own, they were thrilled to custom make a strap on for us. They simply requested an honest review in case they decided to put it in their shop.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha laughs, “Twelve out of Ten. Five stars. I want two more of them in black and green.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I knew you would enjoy it.” Rio helps lead Agatha back to Earth, both feet planted on the ground and turning towards her. Agatha immediately wraps her arms around the other woman and falls into a kiss. Something soft and sweet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio has to reluctantly break apart, “Let’s get you home. There will be a hot bath with your name on it.” Agatha sighs contentedly and goes in for another kiss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love you. Thank you for this. I needed it more than I thought.” The CEO admits softly. Rio brushes a few strands of brown hair from her face and smiles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love you too, </span><em><span>mi esposa</span></em><span>,” Rio accepts another kiss that makes her smile, “Don’t thank me. I think it was something we’ve both been needing.” Agatha hums softly in agreement before pulling her skirt down, not bothering with her thong. Rio tucks the strap back into her slacks with a soft moan that earns her a smirk from her wife. In a few minutes they've collected themselves enough to be considered decent and the papers on the desk aren’t entirely ruined. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The drive to their three story, old-world charm, brick and mortar townhouse was not far from Harkness Energy headquarters. It took a while to find a home that matched them both but as soon as they saw this one they put in a cash offer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>On the first floor, Agatha got the best of her dream in a home library. A mahogany-paneled study with floor-to-ceiling shelves, filled with rare grimoires alongside corporate contracts and scientific journals. A few botany books from Rio’s collection have drifted in from the living room. A heavy desk faces the fireplace, where Agatha often strategizes late into the night.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The kitchen was Rio’s domain. A blend of modern and old-world charm. Exposed brick walls, brass fixtures, and marble counters. Rio’s influence shows in the indoor herb garden, growing everything from basil to foxglove under soft grow-lamps. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s touch came through the woodwork of the walls in how she decorated the space for her wife, elegantly themed kitchen towels and a cheeky themed apron with ‘kiss the cook’ scrawled across the chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Nicky thought it was hilarious. He would call Agatha into the kitchen just to point out the obvious rule as soon as his other mother adorned the apron. Rio would simply smirk in a mix of mischief and amusement, refusing to reject the boy's obvious truth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>More often than not, Agatha would have to tell him she couldn’t kiss </span><em><span>Momma</span></em><span> the </span><em><span>entire time</span></em><span> she cooked. But she indulged in a few pecks with her wife before ushering her son, who inherited her bad trait as a cook from her, into the family room. The front room was softer, cozier—Nicholas’ toys tucked in wicker baskets, walls lined with framed photos of milestones, travels, and family mischief. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>They love this house</span></em><span>. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turns the key and opens the door to let Agatha step through first. When she isn’t immediately hit with a little body in her knees she glances back at Rio who shuts the door. It’s late in the night but their son has a habit of pretending to sleep until he can see her, running down the stairs and into her legs as soon as she steps through the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia offered to take him for the night,” Rio answers knowingly, she spots the sudden drop of a frown on her wife’s features and moves closer. “He’ll be back first thing in the morning to make sure his bags are packed for the trip. Don’t worry.”  Rio takes Agatha’s purse and drops down to one knee to take off the heels on her wife’s feet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, that was nice of her.” Agatha mutters. She would’ve liked to see him but having an uninterrupted night with her wife is hard to be upset about. She places a steadying hand on a strong shoulder as she steps out of the heels aching her feet. She flexes them against the weathered hardwood of the townhome and sighs. Rio stands, placing the purse on its hook and taking the brunette’s hand to lead her upstairs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nicky will be thrilled to see you in the morning, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>,” Rio says sincerely, tugging Agatha along, “He’s raving about dinosaurs right now. I’m sure he’s sweet talked Lilia into buying him more so I’m sure we’ll get a </span><em><span>haul</span></em><span>.” She explains with a fond smile, using the word Nicky learned from his Aunt Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha always says Nicky inherited Rio’s charm. It only proves to be true when anyone in his life seems to eat up all the cuteness he uses to bargain for anything he wants - and gets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get undressed, baby, I’ll run the bath.” Rio leaves the brunette in the middle of the large primary suite as she walks into the large bathroom. One thing they both agreed on, a large, deep, clawfoot bathtub. She adds a few essential oils, lavender and bergamot, and a shake of epsom salt Jen gifted them to help the ache that will surely riddle their bodies in the morning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Getting in with me, love?” Agatha asks as Rio turns toward her. The raven haired woman seems at a loss for words as her eyes skate down the brunette’s naked form. Rio takes a seat on the edge of the tub, spreading her legs to make room for the other woman as she slinks forward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“In a few minutes.” Rio reaches out to bring Agatha forward and runs her hands over her chilled skin. Agatha smiles and reaches behind Rio to pull her hair from the bun. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good, don’t leave me waiting.” Agatha says playfully, leading Rio to look up at her as she leans down for a kiss. Rio smiles and leaves the bathroom on a mission. First she undresses, pulling on Agatha’s floral silk robe before walking down to the kitchen. When she returns back to the bathroom she has two water bottles in hand and a plate of snacks curated specifically to her wife. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha opens her eyes and raises an eyebrow, “Am I getting the princess treatment for a reason?” She teases, lifting herself up to take the offered water bottle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio scoffs, “Pft, </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>. You get </span><em><span>Queen</span></em><span> treatment all year round and you know it.” She teases back, setting down the other items on the stand beside the tub before removing the robe and settling in behind her wife. She sighs, leading Agatha to lean back against her as her left arm wraps around her middle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That I do, wife.” Agatha agrees contentedly, dropping her head back to a strong shoulder and closing her eyes once more. They sit in comfortable silence. The hot bathwater begins to quell the aches in their bones. Rio sits behind her, fingers sifting through Agatha’s hair and all energy is lost. They’re not as young as they once were. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Take me to bed?” Agatha asks sleepily, rolling her head towards Rio’s to place a kiss on her cheek. Rio smiles and nods her head. Soon enough they are climbing into bed and wrapped in each other’s arms. They don’t even remember when they fell asleep, only that a collection of flying elbows and knees wake them up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, </span><em><span>good lord.</span></em><span>” Agatha groans, an elbow in her ribs and a knee in her thigh, eyes peaking open to see Nicky smiling brightly on top of them where Rio currently spoons her in their bed. Rio makes a similar groan of pain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Coño,</span></em> <em><span>mi hijo</span></em><span>.” Rio hisses, also cracking open her eyes to see their son, “I caught an elbow to the chest and a knee to the ass.” Nicky giggles and Agatha can’t help the smile from spreading across her face as well. Lilia must’ve dropped him off and let him through the door before bailing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did we say about flying limbs, sweet boy?” Agatha asks. Nicky giggles some more and hides his face in Rio’s arm. Another smile joins the party. Rio swiftly puts some space between herself and Agatha then drags the little boy between him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gonna answer Momma or do I have to tickle it outta ya?” Rio threatens with a slight narrow of her eyes. A squeal of excited fear screeches from the little boy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! Mami, no! Please!” Nicky cries out. Agatha spins around in the bed and prepares herself. Rio gives her a nod and they attack. The boy wiggles like a worm between them, shrieking and begging for the tickles to stop. Nicky finally apologizes and they retreat from the attack. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How did you sleep, honey? Did you get some rest?” Agatha asks, brushing his wild, curly brown hair from his eyes. The little boy huffs out a breath but smiles with a sure nod. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Momma. I got a new dinosaur from aunt Lilia, ate some ice cream, then fell asleep sooo hard in my dinosaur bed.” Nicky explains happily. Rio pops her head up over the boy with a smug smile. Agatha rolls her eyes and shakes her head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course she did.” Agatha laughs lightly, pulling Nicky closer to place a resounding kiss on his cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you ready for the trip </span><em><span>mi hijo</span></em><span>?” Rio questions curiously, knowing full and well that the little boy has been looking forward to this trip for weeks. Nicky suddenly shoots out of bed, throwing even more elbows and knees as he climbs over his mothers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio groans in pain, “How does such a small boy have such a lethal body?” She sighs and reaches back over to pull Agatha into her arms. The brunette smiles and curls into her wife, enjoying the warmth. “</span><em><span>Abuelita</span></em><span> would’ve fattened him up years ago.” She whispers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha honest to god snorts, “I have no doubt she would’ve kidnapped him just to put some meat on his bones.” Rio chuckles and wraps her wife tighter. They last all of five minutes in blissful peace when their son runs back into their room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Momma! Mami! </span><em><span>Come on</span></em><span>,” The little boy dramatizes the words as he climbs back on the bed, slower and not throwing limbs this time. He flops on top of them regardless. “Aunty Alice and Aunty Jen are gonna get there before us. We have to leave, like right now.” He gushes, a signature pout forming on his lips with an over exaggerated bottom lip. Agatha rolls her eyes and Rio chuckles. Exactly like his Mami. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay, okay. We’re getting up.” Agatha drags herself out of bed then Nicky and finally Rio. It doesn’t take long to load their bags and get Nicky settled into the Escalade out front, soon enough they’re on their way to Salem, Massachusetts to meet Alice, Jen, Lilia and Mrs.Hart.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>They pull up to the cabin, the castle of cabins according to Nicky, when it is truthfully only a three bedroom two bath cabin at the edge of a lake but Nicky adores it. They bought it not long after Nicky started walking and connecting with anything outside - grass, dirt, flowers, anything under the sun. Soon, cabin trips in the fall were their favorites and a few family friends decided to tag along. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Alice and Jen bought their own cabin, then Lilia began tagging along and eventually got her own. It’s been two years since their last trip and Nicky is thrilled. He’s nearly buzzing in his seat as the back door opens and Rio helps him out of the Escalade. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Be careful Nicky!” Agatha calls out quickly, pushing her sunglasses to the top of her head to watch him run off toward the cabin. Rio chuckles and begins grabbing their bags from the trunk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s going to drive you nuts this week,” Rio teases, hoisting a bag onto her shoulder and then another. They have a lot of bags. </span><em><span>Shocker.</span></em><span> Agatha and Nicky travel with a minimum of two bags meanwhile Rio could live out of a single duffle for the week. Which she is. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I just wished he got my caution,” Agatha grumbles with a frown before spinning on her wife, “Instead he got your reckless, caution to the wind, fly by the seat of his pants attitude from </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio smirks and shifts the bags higher onto her shoulder, “I thought you loved that about me, </span><em><span>mi esposa</span></em><span>.” She flirts shamelessly as she steps closer to her wife. Agatha smiles and accepts the advance by using one hand on Rio’s jaw to press their lips together. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> love that,” Agatha husks, her fingers scratching lightly at Rio’s jaw, “About </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>. Not our son.” Rio hums softly in agreement. Agatha gives in to one more kiss and begins walking to the cabin with nothing but her purse in hand.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, </span><em><span>mi amour</span></em><span>,” Rio grabs another bag from the car, “Are you gonna help-” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is another thing I love about you, my love. You have the muscles in the family. I’ll see you inside." Agatha calls out over her shoulder before disappearing into the cabin. Rio huffs with a small smile but follows after her carrying their bags. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Nicky keeps himself busy outside as Agatha unpacks their clothes and Rio cleans off the dust around the cabin. Alice and Jen show up with Lilia after a few hours pass. Luckily they come bearing pizzas and beers. After a few slices and a few hours to catch up, the sun starts to set and Nicky is begging for s’mores. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When was the last time you built a fire, Vidal?” Alice taunts as she brings over more firewood where the raven haired woman is struggling to set up the wood. Rio huffs and narrows her eyes at the other woman. Nicky copies the look from beside his mother, making Alice chuckle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Zip it Wu. I don’t need to remind you what happened the last time you challenged my skills, do I?” Rio quips back with a cheeky smile. Alice glares and Lilia groans. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, no more fire starting competitions. I barely escaped with my life.” Lilia sighs with a shake of her head, sipping her wine with the delicate tip of her glass. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha snorts, “You? I caught on fire.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s a little dramatic, Harkness,” Jen tries to defend her wife only to have a mischievous smirk cross her lips, “Alice put it out quickly.” Alice narrows her eyes at her wife but she can’t help the amused smile that comes across her lips. She tries to bite it back but Jen sees it and smiles wider. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio chuckles and beckons her son closer, “Come here, Nicky.” Agatha is seconds from vetoing when she bites her tongue. She trusts her wife but she still watches anxiously. Rio leads him through the process and helps him with the spark. It takes a few tires but soon enough there are embers in the kindling. A few calculated blows of air has the fire catching and roaring with fuel. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good job, </span><em><span>mi hijo</span></em><span>. Go sit with Momma.” Rio praises as she gives his cheek a kiss and urges him toward the brunette. Agatha smiles with a wink toward the other woman and pulls Nicky into her lap, wrapping him up in her blanket. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Was that fun, Nicky?” Agatha asks softly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Nicky smiles and nods his head, “I liked it a lot, Momma.” A fire glints in his eyes. Oh boy. They might have a little pyro on their hands. From a glance at her wife, she knows exactly where it comes from. Rio crouches and stands, adding wood to the fire then blowing gently to get the right pieces to light. She looks gorgeous tending to the fire. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who’s in charge of the s’mores?” Lilia questions excitedly. It is no surprise when Nicky offers his services, scrambling from Agatha’s lap to run back to the cabin. Once everything is gathered, Agatha being the main s’mores builder, Rio helps Nicky roast the marshmallows over the fireplace. He insists everyone eats a s’more, forcing Jen’s refusal with his signature pout until she caves. Nicky is the last to get his s’more, rewarding himself with two, one in each hand, as he sits in Aunt Alice’s lap. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They reminisce on their old college days and catch up with each other’s lives through the two years they’ve been spread across the country. Jen and Alice moved across the country to California to build Jen’s skincare company and expand Alice’s Private Investigator, Bodyguard, and Bounty Hunter business. Lilia moved north to upstate New York, running a small boutique and taking on a few high end clients as a part time therapist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The night begins running late and Nicky is curled into Rio’s chest now. She shifts the blanket over his sleeping form and runs a hand along his back. Agatha watches in adoration. She got what she wanted. The best of both worlds. Rio, the love of her life, and their son, Nicky, who is the light of their lives, all while running a multibillion dollar company. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Suck it Evanora.</span></p>
