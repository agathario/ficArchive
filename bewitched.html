    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>“It’s just a love spell,” Jen insisted. “Everyone does them.”</p><p>“Well I don’t,” Agatha argued. They were sat in a chic vegan cafe near Jen’s apartment. Jen was enjoying a small serving of pumpkin risotto while Agatha enjoyed her usual Greek salad. </p><p>Agatha had hoped meeting up with her best friend and fellow witch would be a nice way to spend her day off work. Yet of course, Jen had to bring up her inactive love life at the first possible opening.</p><p>“They’re harmless,” Jen insisted. “It’s not the way you think. It doesn’t make someone love you it just leads the person to you. Like the universe creates a way to bring you together.”</p><p>Agatha still grimaced. Usually when she went along with Jen’s spells, they ended in disaster, like the time Jen tried to make her hair blonde and it went bright pink. Okay, that had been when they were in college, but still she was rightfully dubious.</p><p>“Come on,” Jen encouraged. “What’s the harm in trying?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “If I agree, will you leave me alone?”</p><p>Jen grinned and clapped her hands. “Let me gather the ingredients and we can do it tonight! Oh I’m so excited for you!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She hated Jen’s matchmaking meddling, though true to her word she arrived at her apartment that evening with the same sceptical attitude.</p><p>Jen had arranged everything they needed in the middle of her living room, and instructed Agatha to kneel on a pink pillow she had placed in the middle of the candle-lit circle.</p><p>“You’ve got to take this seriously,” Jen told her, before holding out a piece of paper. “Just recite this when I ring the bell.”</p><p>Agatha watched her best friend wafted burnt cleansing herbs around the room and hoped they would be interrupted by the alarm. Yet Jen soon blew out the flames and picked up the bell.</p><p>“Okay, get ready.”</p><p>Agatha accepted defeat, and as soon as the bell rang, she read out the incantation.</p><p>
  <em>From the sun, down to the ground,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Find a love not lost but found.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A love that is fair and true</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And life to share anew. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>To all give my heart</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And never to part</em>
</p><p>
  <em>From now and </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Forevermore.</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt a rush of magic, and the candies extinguished one by one.</p><p>When it was over, Jen turned on her lamp. “There. All done.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha quickly got to her feet. “Now what?”</p><p>“We wait for the path to align, and you’ll meet your soulmate.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Well, may she be smart, and not annoying…and also not super political.”</p><p>“And may she be pleasant looking?” Jen offered teasingly, and Agatha guessed that wouldn’t hurt either. </p><p>Not that she put much faith in any of this. Not even for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>As a day turned into a week, then almost into two, she figured Jen was once again full of shit. There had not been even the slightest nibble of romance, and even when people (mostly men) looked to her appraisingly, she returned no such admiration. No, the spell was just an old witch’s tale, and there was no such thing as a soulmate. </p><p>And so, she carried on with her life: working in a bookstore trying to blend into mundane life by hiding her magic. Same old same old. </p><p>The day that all changed was a Tuesday, and the city was plagued by an unforeseen freak rainstorm. The weather reports had been all sunshine that morning yet come midday it was like a small typhoon had hit the city.</p><p>The store was quiet, with most people sheltering from the rain in Starbucks or deciding not to venture out at all. Agatha took advantage of the time, finishing up some inventory she had been putting off doing. </p><p>Her peace was broken when the door flew open and a sodden mess of dark hair dived inside. </p><p>“Fuck.” The visitor pushed the hair away from their face. “Sorry but that’s a lot of rain.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Even soaking wet, this was the most beautiful woman she has ever seen. With full lips, an adorable little nose, and big brown eyes that made Agatha’s heart flutter. She was wearing gym wear- sport leggings and a blue vest that showed off her muscular arms and…toned glutes.  </p><p>The woman seemed to be regarding her with equal appraise, before approaching the desk. “Can I stay here until it passes? I’ll buy a book.”</p><p>“Will you read it?” Agatha asked and the woman nodded insistently. </p><p>“I love reading. Mostly non-fiction, but I read the Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and it made me cry.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly. “Alright then. I accept your request.”</p><p>The woman smiled, revealing the most adorable tooth gap she’d ever seen. Agatha felt a fluttering feeling in her stomach, something she hadn’t felt since high school. </p><p>The woman held out her hand. “I’m Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.” She shook the woman’s (wet) hand. “I own the place.”</p><p>“A fellow businesswoman,” Rio said with a grin. “I own the flower shop round the block.”</p><p>Agatha knew it. Vidal Flowers. She loved to walk by it on a sunny day to marvel at the explosion of colour.</p><p>“I was on my way back there,” Rio continued. “But the rain hit too bad.”</p><p>“That’s bad luck.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio smirked. “Seems like pretty good luck to me.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hold back what was set to be ridiculously smitten smile. “Well, make sure you find yourself a good read.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.” Rio moved to the labelled ‘non-fiction’ bookshelves, and it was then Agatha caught sight of her tattoo. An Irish knot, the power of three. </p><p>Interesting.  </p><p>“You like witchcraft?” she asked, and Rio laughed. </p><p>“Could ask the same about you. Do you have every book on the Salem witch trials?”</p><p>“If you find any more, let me know and I’ll add it to the inventory.”</p><p>Rio perused the shelves and Agatha attempted to get on with her inventory. Yet she found herself watching Rio instead, fascinated by this mysterious florist that had stumbled into her store. </p><p>It wasn’t long before the rain began to stop, and as the sun began to shine through the windows, Rio approached the desk with a book in hand.</p><p>“This one please, m’lady.”</p><p>Agatha took the book. “The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs?”</p><p>“What? They’re my special interest.”</p><p>“Whatever. As long as you read it.”</p><p>“I will. I promise.” A pause. “I liked Charmed.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“The tattoo,” Rio explained. “I liked Charmed, so as soon as I turned eighteen, I got it.”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>“I was more of a Buffy girl myself,” Agatha admitted. “I kind of had a crush on Prue, though.”</p><p>“Oh no, I love Buffy, but Charmed is my comfort show. I’m a sucker for hot witches.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh at that. </p><p>“Well, I hope you enjoy.” Agatha slid the book towards her. “It’s on the house.”</p><p>“No, I couldn’t…”</p><p>“Call it a neighbourly gesture,” Agatha insisted. “From one independent business owner to the other.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment, before picking up the book. “Then you have to let me pay you back another way.”</p><p>“Oh really?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Dinner. Tomorrow night. My treat.”</p><p>Agatha blinked in surprise. “Dinner? As in-”</p><p>“A date,” Rio clarified. “If you want to?”</p><p>“Oh, I want to,” Agatha answered, and marvelled at the way Rio grinned so brightly. </p><p>“Great, shall I pick you up from here?”</p><p>“Yes, I close around six.”</p><p>“Awesome.” Rio grinned. “See you then, m’lady.”</p><p>Agatha watched her go, waiting until she was gone before allowing herself to grin. It seems Jen’s spell may have worked after all.</p><p>She wasn’t going to admit it quite yet though. The date would be the decider. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha made an effort to look nice the next day. Not enough to look overdressed for work but enough to hopefully impress her date. </p><p>The day had passed slowly, and Agatha spent most of it wishing the time away. Then, at ten to six, as she began to close the shop up, her door flew open once more and Rio burst in.</p><p>“I’m not late, am I?” She asked breathlessly. </p><p>“No, you’re early,” Agatha assured her, while taking in Rio’s attire. She was wearing a blazer-pants combo with a t shirt underneath. Totally gay, and Agatha thought she looked so handsome.</p><p>“My last client wouldn’t shut up,” Rio explained. “In the end I told her I had somewhere important to be.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha teased. “Somewhere important?”</p><p>“Very, very important,” Rio said with a grin. “I’ve been waiting to see you since I left yesterday.”</p><p>“You have?” </p><p>Rio nodded. “And you’re even more beautiful than I remember.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hide her blush by quickly distracting herself with shutting down the store. “Give me ten minutes and I’ll be ready.”</p><p>“Need my help with anything?” Rio asked. “I can be the muscle.”</p><p>“No, just make yourself at home.”</p><p>Rio instead followed her around picking up anything that needed moving and generally tidying up the shelves as they went.</p><p>“Maybe I need to hire you,” Agatha joked. “You’re a good worker.”</p><p>“Or maybe I’m just trying to impress you?” Rio said with a wink. Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Well, it’s working.” </p><p>Once the shop was closed and Agatha set the alarm and locked the doors, Rio led her down the street, to the cute little Italian restaurant just down the block. </p><p>“Sorry it’s not too fancy,” Rio said as they headed inside. “But it’s good to support local businesses.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t believe how ridiculously charming this woman was.</p><p>They were seated at an intimate table for two, and Rio quickly ordered them a bottle of wine for the table as they perused the food menu.</p><p>“I’m going for the linguini,” Agatha announced. “What about you?”</p><p>“Margarita pizza.”</p><p>“Wow, adventurous,” Agatha teased, and Rio laughed along with her.</p><p>“I like what I like. That goes with food, movies, and people.”</p><p>“Ah, so I’m guessing I’m in the like category?”</p><p>“I think I need to invent a whole new category for you.”</p><p>Agatha hid her blush behind her menu until the waiter returned and took them away.</p><p>“So, tell me about yourself.” Rio encouraged. “Where did you grow up?”</p><p>“I was born in Salem, but I hated it. I left as soon as I went to college and never looked back.”</p><p>“That bad, huh?”</p><p>“The worst,” Agatha answered. “My mother was…she wasn’t a good person.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio leaned back in her seat. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It was a long time ago,” Agatha dismissed. “What about you? Where are you from?”</p><p>“I moved around a lot as a kid. I never really had a home, per say. Besides where I lay my hat.”</p><p>“And what of your parents?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I don’t know. I mean I have them, like everyone, but I never knew them. I was, erm, surrendered as a baby.”</p><p>“Oh, Rio.”</p><p>“But it was fine,” Rio assured. “I have always looked after myself, and everything I’ve built up along the way.”</p><p>“And here you are. With your own flower shop.”</p><p>“And you, with your own bookstore.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Not bad for a foster kid and a runaway, huh?”</p><p>Rio started at her a moment. “You’re so beautiful. Sorry, I just can’t get over it.”</p><p>“You can’t?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “How have we not met before?”</p><p><em>Because I cast a spell to find you. </em>“Maybe we passed each other in the street and never realised.”</p><p>“No, we haven’t,” Rio insisted. “Because if I had, I’d have remembered.”</p><p>“Then I guess we just kept missing each other,” Agatha mused. “Until fate brought us together.”</p><p>Rio picked up her wine glass. “To fate, and freak rainstorms.”</p><p>Agatha raised her glass, meet Rio’s with a soft clink. “To us.”</p><p>They stayed at the restaurant until they were politely told to pay up and leave, too busy talking about life, interests, and whatever random topics came up along the way. Agatha had never had that before. Even with Jen, she left when she felt the conversation getting stale, but with Rio it was different.</p><p>Talking with Rio was as easy as breathing. Like they were on the same wavelength in some way. Set to the same frequency that only they could find. Even after just knowing each other a matter of hours, Agatha felt more understood than she had her entire life.</p><p>Rio insisted on walking her home, even though Agatha told her she was only a few blocks away. She didn’t complain. If it meant spending more time with Rio, she’d walk the whole length of the city.</p><p>“So, you have a rabbit called Senõr Scratchy?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And you called him that because…”</p><p>“That’s what he wanted to call himself.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Have you had too much to drink, Miss Harkness?”</p><p>“Okay, maybe more than I should have,” Agatha played along. How was she meant to explain to Rio that Scratchy was a familiar, and had picked his own name through their magical connection?</p><p>They soon reached her building, and Agatha wished she lived another block away. She didn’t want the night to end. Not yet.</p><p>“Can I see you again?” Rio asked hopefully. “I can bring you lunch tomorrow if you want?”</p><p>“I’d like that.” And Agatha meant it. She really, really would. “So, I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Tomorrow,” Rio repeated.</p><p>Neither of them moved, too scared to make the first move. Agatha eventually cleared her throat. “I better…”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio agreed. “It was…thanks for an amazing evening.”</p><p>“You too,” Agatha returned. “Goodnight then.”</p><p>“Goodnight.” Rio leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. When she realised what she did, her eyes widened. “Shit, sorry I…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her finish. She leaped forward and captured the florist’s lips in a fierce kiss.</p><p>The world stood still, and it was then Agatha knew it for sure.</p><p>The spell had worked.</p><p>Rio was her soulmate.</p><p>Pulling back, she studied Rio’s startled face and watched as her date’s lips curled into a soft smirk. “Wow.”</p><p>“Wow indeed.” Agatha stepped backwards towards the building door. “Bye for now, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“You’re such a tease, Harkness,” Rio called back, her face lit up in a grin. A grin that also graced Agatha’s own lips as she made her way inside.</p><p>Oh she couldn’t wait to tell Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“I knew it!” Jen squealed excitedly. “I knew the spell would work!”</p><p>They were back in the same cafe a week later. A week of lunches and dates that had solidified Agatha’s belief that the spell had in fact worked. That it had led her to Rio, and she couldn’t be happier.</p><p>Not much had happened beyond soft kisses and words of admiration, but Agatha was in no rush. The rest would come in time, and she planned to savour every moment.</p><p>“What’s she like?” Jen asked. “What’s her name?”</p><p>“Her name is Rio and she’s a florist. She likes going to the gym and tells the most ridiculous jokes, and she’s kind and thoughtful and…she’s amazing.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m so happy! And I can tell you are too.”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha admitted. “Thanks, Jen. I know Rio and I would have likely met anyway, but I’m grateful for the kick-start.”</p><p>“You are very much welcome,” Jen said with a grin. “So, what kind of witch is she?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Rio. I’m guessing she’s a green witch?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her coffee. “No, erm, she’s actually not a witch at all.”</p><p>There was a long pause, and after a while she dared to look at her friend’s expression.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen finally spoke. “Please tell me you’re joking.”</p><p>Agatha held her head high. “I’m not. Rio is magicless.”</p><p>Jen blinked at her in disbelief. “Agatha, what the fuck were you thinking?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You can’t date someone who’s magicless. It’s like the unwritten rule of witch dating!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re overreacting.”</p><p>“No, I’m <em>really</em> not,” Jen insisted. “How do you think she’ll react when she finds out who you really are?”</p><p>“She’ll be fine.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“She’s likes Charmed.”</p><p>Jen hid her head in her hands. “This just gets worse. You have to break up with her now.”</p><p>“But she’s my soulmate,” Agatha argued. “You’re the one who said…”</p><p>“Agatha, you can’t date her. Think about it, your options are telling her and probably ending up exposing true witchcraft to the entire magicless world, or spending the rest of your life together hiding your magic. Either way, you lose.”</p><p>Agatha considered her words and realised there was some truth in there. She refused to admit it though and held her ground. “I’m not losing Rio.”</p><p>Jen shook her head. “You’re making a mistake.”</p><p>“No, I’m not,” Agatha said with confidence. “It’ll all work out. You’ll see.”</p><p>Still, Jen’s words weighed heavily on her mind. She knew telling Rio about her true identify had the possibility of turning sour, but she had been so caught up in the courtship that she hadn’t thought much about the consequences.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem like the type of person who would run to Dr Phil claiming she’d dated a ‘real witch’, but she’d definitely freak out at least a little. Best case scenario they’d be tense for a couple of days before the found their rhythm again. Worst was Rio would cast her aside forever, and she’d live the rest of her life alone.</p><p>Rio entered the bookshop just after three with two take-away coffee cups in her hands. She placed one on the desk in front of Agatha and grinned. “Coffee, m’lady.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. Rio was always so thoughtful. “Why thank you, m’lord. How’s your day going?”</p><p>“Boring,” she answered, before grumbling. “I wish I hadn’t agreed to this pick-up game tonight. I want to spend time with you.”</p><p>“You need to spend time with your friends, too,” Agatha reminded her. “We can’t spend every day together.”</p><p>Rio pouted. “Why not?”</p><p>“Because…” Agatha couldn’t come up with a good reason. “I guess distance makes the heart grow fonder.”</p><p>“Distance makes the heart hurt like hell,” Rio countered before sighing dramatically. “But I guess I will have to suffer. To make up for it, however, I would like to invite you to my place for dinner tomorrow night.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. They hadn’t really been in each other’s apartments yet, instead frequenting each other’s stores when they weren’t having dinner or at the movies or taking relaxing strolls around the neighbourhood.</p><p>This was a definite step, one she was all too ready for.</p><p>“What time do you want me round?”</p><p>“About seven? It will give me enough time to sort out dinner.”</p><p>“You’re cooking for me?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Please, I want to impress you, not traumatised you. No, my friend Lilia has offered to make us her favourite lasagne. And trust me, it’s unreal.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll hold you to that.” Agatha leaned across the counter. “Because if not, you’ll have to make it up to me.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Rio leaned forward also, until their lips were mere millimetres apart. “In that case, I’ll swap Lilia’s salt out for sugar.”</p><p>“You’re such a dork,” Agatha said, before meeting her in a sweet kiss.</p><p>There was something about kissing Rio that it made her feel like she was floating. Like she was rising up, until she had to crane her neck to…</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She was actually floating.</p><p>Agatha forced her feet back to the ground, the sudden jolt making them break apart.</p><p>Rio looked to her in confusion. “Were you kissing me on your tiptoes?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha lied.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why not?” she challenged, while Rio eyed her curiously.</p><p>“Right. Okay. Well, I’d better get back to my shop. I’ll call you later?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha put on a smile. “Speak to you later.”</p><p>She watched Rio leave, waving at her until she was out of sight. It was then she allowed the smile to fall. That had been a close call. Usually, she had perfect control over her magic, but in that moment she had been so open, so relaxed that she had forgotten to keep herself in check.</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her coffee as Jen’s words echoed in her mind once more. Even if she wanted to, could she hide her magic? Not just for a day, or a week, but for years. Decades. Her secret had almost been revealed by a kiss. What would happen when they finally had sex? Or when they first said ‘I love you’, or at the alter exchanging vows?</p><p>It was then Agatha decided. She would tell Rio tomorrow night and hope the feelings between them would be strong enough to overcome it.</p><p>It was her only option.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s apartment was a short walk away from her own, in a pre-war building that still had one of those old grate-door elevators. Agatha elected to take the stairs, heading up three floors and making her way to apartment 3b.</p><p>She knocked on the door and composed herself. Her brain had been running through the whole scenario a thousand times. They would enjoy their dinner, laugh and chatter, before Agatha would ask Rio to join her on the couch to talk. Then, she would tell her.</p><p>She would tell her everything, from her youth growing up in the salemites coven, how she broke their strict rules to make her magic grow (and been caught having sex with a girl), how she tried to escape by leaving for college only to be turned on by her own mother, how she was almost executed before she used her power to…okay she’d leave that last part out for now.</p><p>The goal was to freak Rio out as little as possible, so mentioning that she uno reversed her execution and killed her entire coven probably wouldn’t help her cause.</p><p>When Rio opened the door, she was dressed in a casual t-shirt and jeans, her hair tied back in a messy ponytail. She smiled and looked over Agatha’s slightly less casual attire, before fixating on the neckline of her tight-fitted crimson top. “You look amazing.”</p><p>“And you look cute.” Agatha kissed her cheek and stepped inside. Rio’s apartment was how she imagined it. Full of plants and framed botany studies, with random gym gear and equipment strewed wherever there was room. It was like she was walking into Rio’s mind. “Nice place.”</p><p>“Sorry, I tried to clean up, but I have way too much stuff.” Rio led her through to the living area. “Please make yourself comfortable. The lasagne won’t be long.”</p><p>“Well, it certainly smells good,” Agatha commented as she settled on the couch. It was then she noticed a book on the chair arm. “You’re actually reading that dinosaur book?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio answered from the kitchen. “I love dinosaurs. I’ve got the Lego Jurassic Park Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil ready to build when I get a free day, but I keep getting distracted by a pretty bookshop owner.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha supressed a smile. “Anyone I know?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio continued to tease. “But I still need to get to that Lego.”</p><p>“Perhaps she’d like to build it with you?” Agatha suggested. “It’s a cute date idea.”</p><p>Rio looked over form the kitchen and smiled. “I might just have to.”</p><p>Dinner was soon ready, and the delicious smell of the lasagne was nothing compared to the taste.</p><p>“Holy fucking shit!” Agatha gasped with her mouth full. “That’s…wow.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yep, Lilia is famous for her lasagne. She was my roommate when I moved to the city, and she used to make great Italian food, and more specifically Sicilian food all the time. When I got my own place closer to the shop, she always makes sure I have at least one good meal a week. I asked her especially to make this tonight, and she’s very excited to see what you think.”</p><p>“You’ve told her about me?”</p><p>“Of course! I’ve been telling anyone who’ll listen.” Rio reached over and took her hand. “I’d shout it from the rooftops and hire a parade float if I could.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and squeezed Rio’s hand. She couldn’t wait until there were no secrets between them, so that they could be totally open, more so than she had ever allowed herself to be.</p><p>After dinner, Rio put on some music, and they moved to sit on the couch. </p><p>Agatha’s intention had been for them to talk, but almost as soon as she sat on the couch, Rio was kissing her. Their usual sensual kissing at first, before things got quicker, got heated. She didn’t want it to end, wanted them to follow through with what Rio had not so subtly set in motion, yet she had to do</p><p>“Rio, I need to talk to you about something.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I know we’ve been treating this casual, but we both know it’s not. So I’ll be the one to ask: will you be my girlfriend?”</p><p>Suddenly, all thought of witchcraft left her mind. “You want me to be your girlfriend?”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Rio insisted. “You’re amazing.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “You’re pretty amazing too.”</p><p>“So?” Rio asked hopefully. “What do you say?”</p><p>“I say absolutely yes.” </p><p>Rio jumped to her feet and pulled Agatha up with her. She gave her a toe-curling kiss, before lifting her up by her thighs. “Bedroom?”</p><p>Agatha grinned and nodded. “Bedroom.”</p><p>Rio carried her through to a room that was surprisingly plain compared to the rest of the apartment. A place just for sleeping, and now something else…</p><p>Rio laid her carefully on the bed before standing straight and pulling her shirt over her head.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but stare. All evening, she hadn’t noticed her girlfriend wasn’t wearing a bra.</p><p>Then she pulled down her pants and revealed she hadn’t been wearing any underwear at all. </p><p>“Did you just go commando tonight, or…”</p><p>Rio shrugged awkwardly. “Sometimes I wear boxers.”</p><p>That was so fucking hot. Agatha sat off and pulled off her own shirt and bra, before shimmying out of her pants and panties all in one go. Then there they were, bare before each other. </p><p>Rio’s eyes travelled over her and smiled. “You’re beautiful.”</p><p>“So are you.” Agatha lay back, propping herself up on her elbows as she spread her legs. “</p><p>Before she could finish, Rio’s head was between her legs.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio.”</p><p>“You can do that later,” Rio teased and continued to work her expertly with her tongue before climbing over her, slotting their hips together. “This okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and groaned as their hips grinded in a steady rhythm. The friction was intoxicating, and she quickly found herself thrusting desperately into Rio until they were rutting like horny bunnies.</p><p>She soon got lost in the sensation, in the steady climb of pleasure. Then the bubble burst and she came apart, her body shaking as Rio groaned in her ear at her own release.</p><p>The surface beneath them dropped, the legs of the bed hit the floor with a loud thud. </p><p>Agatha tensed. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She’d made the bed float.</p><p>Rio, however, just laughed. “We really rocked the boat huh?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and held her close. “Guess we did.”</p><p> </p><p>Being Rio Vidal’s girlfriend came with all the perks from the courtship, with the added bonus of confirmed exclusivity and hot sex. Lots and lots of hot sex. </p><p>Agatha had always been a sexual person, but sex with Rio was a whole different ballgame. It was exciting, intense, and so fucking good. So good that she had been too busy recalling the previous night’s escapades that she hadn’t noticed her friend enter the shop until she was stood right in front of her. </p><p>“Get your head out of the gutter,” Jen teased, and Agatha rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Shut up, Kale.”</p><p>Jen laughed loudly. “Oh, you’ve got it bad for that magicless.”</p><p>“Don’t call her that,” Agatha snapped. “She’s my girlfriend.” </p><p>“She’s your girlfriend now?” Jen started at her in disbelief. “Agatha, what the fuck are you doing?”</p><p>“Living my life, Jen. And I know you don’t approve…”</p><p>“Hey, I don’t discriminate. Magic, non-magic whatever floats your boat. But you’re not just some witch, Agatha. You killed the Salemites. A nearly four-century old coven gone within an instant at <em>your</em> hands. You don’t just get to play house with magicless and expect nothing to go terribly wrong.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not stupid, Kale.”</p><p>“Then why are you acting like it?”</p><p>“Because she makes me happy, okay?” Agatha admitted. “Happier than I’ve ever been in my entire miserable fucking life and I just wish I wasn’t a stupid fucking witch so it wouldn’t inevitably fuck it all up. Fuck!”</p><p>Jen gave her a sympathetic look. “Oh, Agatha.”</p><p>“Don’t do that,” she huffed. “I’m not having you feel sorry for me. I’ll work something out.”</p><p>“As long as you’re trying to.” </p><p>“I am,” Agatha promised. “I really am.”</p><p> </p><p>Two days later, she decided she’d finally tell Rio. No more putting it off. She deserved to know. </p><p>Agatha picked up two coffees on her lunch break and walked the now familiar route to Rio’s shop. She’d always loved the sight of it, all those different flowers laid out in a rainbow of colour, but now it held an even fonder place in her heart, knowing the wonderful person behind it. </p><p>When she entered, she found Rio stood by the counter, talking with a woman intensely. She was tall with jet black hair and sharp cheekbones and was wearing some kind of gothic jumpsuit. Agatha didn’t recognise her but took an instant disliking to her. </p><p>“Rio, will you just…” </p><p>“No.” Rio’s voice was stern, commanding. Something Agatha hadn’t heard before. “I have given enough. Let me have this time with her.” </p><p>“You know it doesn’t work like that,” the woman argued. “When we agreed to this, you said…” </p><p>“It doesn’t matter what I said,” Rio snapped. “It works however I want it.” </p><p>Agatha decided to make herself known and walked over with a bright smile. “Hey, honey.” </p><p>Both women looked to her, Rio in surprise while the other woman eyed her curiously. </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio stepped up and greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. “Hey sweetheart.” </p><p>Agatha smiled at the woman stiffly. “And who’s this?” </p><p>“This is Hela,” Rio introduced. “She works for me.” </p><p>“Oh?” That was strange. Rio had never mentioned her before. “So you’re a florist too?” </p><p>Hela didn’t answer, just shot Rio a glare as she moved towards the door. “Just remember what your <em>real </em>job is.” </p><p>Once she was gone, Agatha looked to Rio questioningly. “What was that about?” </p><p>“Nothing,” Rio assured. “You brought me coffee?” </p><p>“I did.” Agatha handed the cup over, savouring Rio’s smile.  </p><p>“You’re literally the best.” </p><p>Agatha smiled brightly, before remembering the true intention behind very visit. “I need to talk to you about something.” </p><p>“Oh?” Rio took a sip of her drink. “What’s up?” </p><p>“It’s…” She’d had the words planned and ready, but now the moment was here, and she couldn’t recall a single thing. “I don’t really know what to say it without sounding crazy, but…” </p><p>“Ah.” Rio set their drinks down on the counter and took her hands in hers. “I get it.” </p><p>“You do?” </p><p>“Yeah, and I want to say it too. I really, really do. Because, well, I do, Agatha. I love you.” </p><p>The whole world stopped. </p><p>“Y-you do?” </p><p>“I really, really, really do.” Rio smiled with relief, like a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. “I know it’s probably too soon, but I’ve never felt like this, well, ever.” </p><p>“Me neither,” Agatha admitted. “And it’s terrifying because I want to do this right, but I have no idea and I love you so much, and…” </p><p>Rio cupped her cheek. “Hey, hey, hey. You’re doing everything right, Agatha. We’re good, we’re happy. I love you, you love me. That’s all that matters.” </p><p>Agatha hugged her tight, burying her face into her girlfriend’s shoulder. She hoped Rio truly believed that, then perhaps her admission wouldn’t be as disastrous.  </p><p>They finished their coffees and Agatha reluctantly headed back to her own shop. She allowed her employee to go for their own break, leaving her alone in the quiet store. Alone with her thoughts, which had once again circled back to Rio.</p><p>She was a coward. She couldn’t do it and ended up making Rio spill her heart out instead. Again. She was the worst girlfriend ever. </p><p>The door to the shop opened and she looked to see a teenage boy walk in. He was tall with curly black hair and a boat load of eyeliner. All his clothes had rips in, the kind that were part of their manufacture, and he had a notebook clutched to his chest.</p><p>He looked around the shop before his gaze locked with hers. His eyes widened and he cautiously approached the desk.</p><p>Agatha put on a smile. “How may I help you?”</p><p>“I came to talk to you.”</p><p>“To me?”</p><p>The teen nodded. “You’re Agatha Harkness.” </p><p>“I am,” she confirmed, folding her eyes. “Who’s asking?” </p><p>“I’m Billy Kaplan, and I’m here to save you.”</p><p>“Save me?” Agatha cackled. “I can look after myself, thank you’ve much.”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Billy insisted. “You’re in terrible danger.”</p><p>“I’m always in terrible danger,” Agatha dismissed. “So unless you’re going to buy something…”</p><p>“I know there’s some witches trying to kill you.”</p><p>“There’s always-“</p><p>“They call themselves the Salem Seven.”</p><p>Agatha froze. “Salem?”</p><p>Billy nodded. “I met them in a witchcraft chatroom. They’re looking for any information about you. I got chatting with one of them, and they said they wanted revenge. That they wanted to kill you because you killed their parents.”</p><p>Her heart dropped. She knew exactly who the Salem Seven were: the children of her coven, whose mothers died trying to kill her.</p><p>“What else did they say?” she questioned.</p><p>“That they knew you were somewhere in the city, and that they needed someone with my powerset to trap you.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and looked the boy up and down. “And what powerset is that?”</p><p>“Telekinesis, manipulation of space. It’s chaos magic.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “And why are you telling me? Did they not tell you want I did?”</p><p>“Yeah, but I did some digging of my own.” He reached into his notebook and pulled out a folded piece of paper. He opened it up and handed it over. Agatha frowned at it.</p><p>“How did you get my yearbook photo?”</p><p>“I’m good at online research. I found online articles about…what happened. They said it was a cult sacrifice, that neighbours said your mother was very religious. How they often…worried about you.”</p><p>Agatha laughed bitterly. “Yeah, so worried they let me stay with that evil bitch.”</p><p>“You were a scared kid.” Teen looked down at his feet. “I get that.”</p><p>She frowned. “Are your parents…”</p><p>“They’re wonderful,” he quickly clarified. “They just don’t know what I am. A warlock and, well, gay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding. “Well my mum knew I was a witch and hated I was a lesbian. That was why I tried to run away and I…” She cleared her throat, pushing the tears away. “So what’s the plan, Teen? You want me to go apologise and tell them their parents tried to kill me first?”</p><p>Teen shrugged. “It’s worth a try, or we run. Buy us some time.”</p><p>“I’m not running,” Agatha insisted. “I’ve built a life here. They can come find me, and if they try kill me, I’ll do the same to them as I did to their parents.”</p><p>The teen’s eyes widened. “Agatha, they’re just kids.”</p><p>“So are you,” she reminded him. “And so was I.”</p><p>His shoulder’s slumped. “Well, I guess we need to get ourselves a coven, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen and her girlfriend, Alice soon arrived at the shop. Alice introduced herself to Billy politely, while Jen looked him up and down in judgement, before shifting the same look to Agatha.”</p><p>“What have you done now, Harkness?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she insisted. “Well, nothing new.”</p><p>They settled in the kid’s reading area, Alice and Jen on the beanbags while she and Teen remained standing. They recited the whole situation to them both, from the past horrors to the recent plot of revenge. Alice nodded along quietly, while Jen kept interrupting with comments and disapproving sounds. When the tale was done, Jen sighed and stood up.</p><p>“So, when are we leaving?”</p><p>“We’re not,” Agatha answered.</p><p>“We’re not?” Jen put her hands on her hips. “Do you have a death wish, Harkness?”</p><p>“I can kill them easily,” she said dismissively.</p><p>“And we’ll end up having to deal with seven bodies,” Alice argued. “We could go to prison.”</p><p>“No, <em>she </em>will go to prison.” Jen pointed at Agatha accusingly. “I’m not going to prison for you, Agatha.”</p><p>“Did I ask you to?” Agatha snapped. “Teen wanted you here. I can handle this myself.”</p><p>“Fine, if that’s what you want.” Jen went to leave, but Alice tugged her back down on the beanbag.</p><p>“We can’t just leave her,” Alice argued. “And we can’t make her leave.”</p><p>Jen looked at Agatha suspiciously. “This is all about Rio, isn’t it? You don’t want to leave her.”</p><p>“Great detective skills there, Jen. Olivia Benson has nothing on you.”</p><p>“Fuck off, Agatha. You’re a fucking idiot. You do realise staying puts Rio in danger, right? No, it puts <em>everyone</em> in danger.”</p><p>“I know that, but…”</p><p>“But?” Jen questioned and Agatha’s shoulders slumped in defeat.</p><p>“I was finally happy.”</p><p>As Alice and Teen’s expressions turned to sympathy, Jen rolled her eyes and got to her feet one more, yanking her best friend into a hug.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I should never have done that stupid spell.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t regret the spell. She loved Rio. Loved her so much it made her chest hurt. She wished she didn’t have a fucked up past, and an even more fucked up present. Wished she was a magicless who just owned a bookstore and fell in love with the local florist. Maybe in that life, she could have a happiness that lasts.</p><p>But not in this one.</p><p>She pulled out of Jen’s embrace and pulled out her phone.</p><p>
  <strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hey where are you?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh shit did we have plans?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>No but I want to see you.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m at a bar with Lilia. Come join us if you want. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Send me the address and I’ll set off now.</em>
</p><p>As soon as she got it, Agatha went to leave.</p><p>“Agatha, we don’t have time,” Teen argued. “We need to go.”</p><p>“We will,” Agatha promised. “I-I just need to say goodbye.”</p><p> </p><p>The coven entered the bar and found Rio sat with an older woman by the bar. Rio must have sensed her presence because she quickly looked over and smiled brighter than a million stars. Agatha smiled back, even though she wanted to cry.</p><p>“Wow, she’s prettier than I thought,” Jen commented, and Agatha nodded.</p><p>“She’s the most beautiful person in the world.”</p><p>Alice put a supportive hand on her shoulder. “Let’s go talk to her.”</p><p>They walked over to the table and Rio jumped out of her seat to give Agatha a sweet kiss. “I’m so happy to see you.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha said truthfully. Despite the circumstances, she would always be happy to see Rio. “These are my friends, Jen and Alice. My, erm, shop assistant was going to come too, but he got carded at the door.”</p><p>Rio shook Jen and Alice’s hands, before waving her hands at her companion. “This is Lilia. My awesome ex roommate and forever friend.”</p><p>Lilia raised her glass to all of them before giving Agatha a wink. “I’ve heard a lot about you, Agatha.”</p><p>“All good, I hope.”</p><p>Lilia laughed “Like this one will say a bad thing about you. She talks like you’re made of stardust.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head before reaching down to take her hand. “Fancy a dance before Lilia embarrasses me?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and nodded. “Lead the way.”</p><p>Rio led them both to the dancefloor and they began to sway to the music. Agatha felt her girlfriend’s hands on her hips before sliding lower.</p><p>“Rio, we’re in public and our friends are right over there.”</p><p>Rio smirked mischievously, but her hands moved back upwards. “You know, you have a really cute ass. It’s kind of distracting.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. She loved Rio’s ridiculousness.</p><p>“Well I need you to concentrate because I-I need to tell you something. The real something I came to talk to you about today.”</p><p>Rio looked at her with a frown. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha admitted. “I-I came to say goodbye.”</p><p>“Goodbye?” Rio’s frown deepened. “What do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?”</p><p>“No, well I guess, but I don’t want to. I just…I have to leave.”</p><p>“Leave where?” Rio questioned. “I’ll come with you.”</p><p>“No, Rio. It’s not safe. I’m in trouble, okay? And I don’t want you getting hurt.”</p><p>Rio pulled her closer, holding her protectively. “In trouble how?”</p><p>“I did something bad a long time ago,” Agatha admitted. “I didn’t have a choice, but there are people who want revenge for what I did. And…And I’ve never been honest with you. Not really. There’s something about me that you don’t know. Something big.”</p><p>“What?” Rio questioned. “Agatha, you know you can tell me anything, right?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a deep breath. “Rio, I’m a…”</p><p>BANG.</p><p>Screams.</p><p>Shots.</p><p>“AGATHA HARKNESS.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. It seemed running away wasn’t an option anymore.</p><p>The Salem Seven had blasted a hole in the wall, emerging through the smoke and rubble in ridiculous matching outfits, seamlessly dodging the retreating magicless crowd trying to escape.  One of them dragged Teen along in a headlock, and he had a deep scratch across his cheek. Agatha glowered. They were just like their parents. </p><p>Jen and Alice were at her side in an instant, Lilia along with them. </p><p>“You can’t fight them alone,” Jen said, and Alice quickly agreed. Agatha, however, did not.</p><p>“Leave this to me. Just make sure Rio is okay.”</p><p>Lilia laughed. “Rio can handle herself.”</p><p>“No, she really can’t,” Agatha snapped. “You don’t understand, Magicless. Let me deal with this.”</p><p>One of the seven stepped up. “You killed our patents.”</p><p>“And your parents tried to kill me,” Agatha pointed out. “They were fair game.”</p><p>The seven holding Teen pulled him forward. “Surrender to us and we’ll spare the boy.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I only me him this morning.”</p><p><em>“Agatha,”</em> Alice scolded, and she rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Just let the boy go. He has nothing to do with this.”</p><p>“He betrayed our trust,” another accused. “Found out our plan and told the enemy.”</p><p>“She’s not the enemy,” Teen insisted. “She was just a kid.”</p><p>“So were we,” Teen’s captor argued. “She killed our mothers due to her own selfishness. And now, she will pay.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, forming a ball of purple in her hands. “Let’s see if you make me break a sweat.”</p><p>One of the seven ran forward, magic in their palms ready to strike. Agatha smirked and waited. One taste of that magic and she’d suck the little fucker dry. Yet before they could reach her, before she could get a hold of that magic, they were thrown back through the air, falling at the feet of their comrades.</p><p>“<em>ENOUGH.”</em></p><p>The whole room went still, and all eyes moved to Rio.</p><p>“Anyone who tries to hurt Agatha Harkness will spend the rest of eternity in a realm of constant torture.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Rio?”</p><p>Rio stepped forward and her usual clothes disintegrated, replaced with a black jumpsuit that looked like it was made from twisting vines, with her, erm, <em>toned</em> abs on full display. A matching crown rested on her head, and a green dagger was held tight in her palm.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Jen gasped. “Rios a witch?!”</p><p>Lilia laughed again. “Oh she’s more than that.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Alice questioned.</p><p>“Rio,” Lilia began. “She’s death.”</p><p>
  <em>DEATH?!?!?</em>
</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio and saw her face had changed. Her mouth, her nose, the entire lower part of her face had become skeletal, and her eyes were darker than she knew possible. </p><p>“Leave,” Rio commanded the Salem Seven. “And never think of Agatha Harkness again.”</p><p>The Salem Seven retreated without hesitation, dropping Teen to the floor as they made their escape. He sat up and looked around. “It was that easy?”</p><p>Rio’s face returned to normal, and she looked to Agatha sheepishly. </p><p>“Guess we were both keeping things from each other.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Her entire world had been thrown upside down, and there was only one thing she could do. She strode forward and pulled Rio, Death, the love of her life, into a heated kiss. A kiss free of secrets and lies. One of pure acceptance.</p><p>She heard Jen laugh somewhere behind them. “I should have known. Of course Agatha’s true love would be Death.”</p><p>Agatha figured she had a point, but it wasn’t entirely true. Her true love wasn’t Death. It was Rio. The one who made her smile and laugh, just as Rio’s true love wasn’t the famous witch killed.</p><p>They just all happened to be one and the same.</p><p> </p><p>“So Hela is your, like, understudy?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio answered as they walked hand in hand along the river. They had left the others to deal with the clean up at the bar, insisting they need to talk. Which they did, but also Agatha hated clean-up duty. </p><p>“And you’re not been death for like, what, ten years?”</p><p>“I bound my powers.” Rio pulled up the sleeve of her shirt and revealed the tattoo. “I can’t take away my powers altogether, but I stopped all the voices, the pull to lost souls.”</p><p>“But why?” Agatha questioned. “You’re a cosmic being? Why would you want to run a flower shop and get coffee?”</p><p> “I wanted to experience what so many were so sad to leave behind. So, Hela agreed that she would be death for ten years so I could see what all the fuss it’s is about.”</p><p>“And what did you think?” </p><p>“It was good.” Rio squeezed her hand. “Then it got really good. So good that I almost forgot the ten years was up, and when Hela came to swap back I…well I refused.”</p><p>“Can you refuse?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It’s worth a try, unless I can persuade Hela otherwise. I’ve only just found you, and if it were up to me, I’d never leave your side.”</p><p>“Really?” </p><p>Rio nodded. “I love you, Agatha.”</p><p>“I love you too.” Agatha placed a quick kiss to her lips. “We’ll work things out. After all, I’m not just some magicless or young doe-eyed witch.”</p><p>“Oh I know,” Rio grinned. “You’re my perfect match.”</p><p>“You know, I used a soulmate spell before we met,” Agatha admitted.</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “You did?” </p><p>Agatha nodded. “And then you stumbled into my shop during a freak storm.”</p><p>Rio kissed her on the cheek. “Guess it’s official then. We’re in it for the long haul.”</p><p>“The long haul,” Agatha repeated. Which she knew would be eternity. </p>
