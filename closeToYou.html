    <p>
     Jennifer’s chest violently rose and fell as she stared up at the ceiling of her temporary apartment here in Pawnee. She was seeing stars, her vision momentarily blacking out before she regained consciousness. Trying her best to steady her breathing, she threw her hands over her face and closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Below her, a person slowly kisses their way up her body until they are fully laying on top of her. A pleasurable groan leaves Jen’s lips when their breasts touch. A sweet kiss is left on her lips and she feels those same soft lips kiss down her jaw and over the growing hickey on her collarbone. Jen doesn’t mean to but a smile falls onto her face and she has to bite the inside of her own cheek to stop herself from smiling too wide, giving away how happy she feels right now. She removes her hands and looks down, finding big brown eyes staring back at her like she hung the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, how April Ludgate has bewitched her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen didn’t expect much out of her 9 months in Pawnee. She expected to be disgusted, irritated, and annoyed (which she was, for the most part) but what she didn’t expect was
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     . Since Jen’s first day in Pawnee, April had caught her attention almost instantly. She was the only person who didn’t give Jen the time of day, as if she didn’t even exist, and she kinda loved it. The older woman loved the challenge and April Ludgate was an enigma to her. In brief private moments away from the rest of the office, Jen would tease and flirt with the younger woman but April didn’t seem to be cracking. Just when Jen was about to give up because she wasn’t one to chase, April must’ve had enough because she cornered the older woman in the restroom and slammed their lips together. And that was 5 months ago. 5 months of sleeping together. 5 months of spending long nights and weekends tangled up with each other's arms. 5 months of April Ludgate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now Jen finds herself brushing long brown locks away from April’s face and caressing her soft cheek. The younger woman melts into her touch, never breaking eye contact. For some reason, to Jen, this was way more intimate than the marathon of life changing sex they just had and it scared the shit out of her. Maybe it was because she felt a lot more for the younger woman than she has ever felt for anyone ever before. She felt also protective of April, possessive even, and Jennifer Barkley was previously none of those things.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen.” April’s voice is barely above a whisper. “Jen. I lov-”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Jen knows what April is about to say and it makes her sick to her stomach. She can’t hear it. Not when all Jen has known is hookups and friends with benefits. Not when Jen is actually terrified of commitment because she doesn’t think anyone could or would tolerate her for that long. Not when Jen only has 1 more month in Pawnee before she goes back to DC. Not when Jen has been trying to convince herself over the course of these past 5 months with April that this was nothing, that her own feelings were invalid and stupid. That waking up in April’s arms doesn’t make her feel the happiest and safest she’s ever felt in her life. So if Jen actually heard April say those three words, she knows it would completely break her. Jen knows that she’d be forced to confront her feelings, forced to come to terms with the truth that she was falling as well or maybe she was already those three words.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no. Jen is a lone wolf, a covenless witch, and that is how she’ll always stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to end this.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Unfortunately the very next day Jen has to go into the Pawnee office for a meeting with Leslie. This meant she was bound to see April and Jen was just not mentally ready for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last night was a disaster. After Jen dropped the initial bomb, the hurt on April’s face was almost enough to make Jen come clean. Almost.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t mean that.” April sat up from her laying down position, intently staring down at Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen tried her best to school her emotions and not get distracted by April’s bare chest. She prayed April couldn’t feel her quickening heart rate as she didn’t break eye contact and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Aw sweetie. I thought we both knew this was just casual. And since I’m leaving in a couple weeks, I think it’d be better to just end things now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Casual.” April repeats, her sadness now morphing into anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well what else would you call this? I mean we aren’t exclusive. I’ve been sleeping around. I’m a woman of many needs. You know that, April.” Jen hasn’t been sleeping around and April knows that because they spend almost every waking moment together. And truthfully Jen hasn’t even so much as looked at another person since April but she still puts on her practiced HBIC face and it must be convincing enough (or irritating enough) because April angrily pushes off her body and starts gathering her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen wants to desperately sit up, stop April from leaving, tell her the truth, but instead she stays laying put in the middle of the bed and pretends to be occupied with her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s quiet for some time but then she hears April making her way towards the bedroom door when the girl halts, hand hovering over the doorknob.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re such an idiot sometimes, Jen.” April’s voice betrays her anger, her voice cracks and thus cracks a piece of Jen’s heart as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so Jen spent the rest of the night crying. She woke up with an extremely red and puffy face and spent hours trying to bring herself back to full restoration just to start crying again. She somehow slapped on enough makeup to look passable but she feared April would see right through her facade.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she gets to the office, her eyes unconsciously look towards April’s desk to find it empty. Which was odd, because April was always at her desk at this hour. As she makes her way through the office she sees a familiar head of brown hair that makes her heart beat faster and her palms sweat. But then she sees another woman across from her, another brunette, bring April into a hug that looks all too intimate. Jen moves closer and sees it’s Ann Perkins. Oh fucking course it is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen has always thought Ann had a thing for April and it had bothered from day one. She also thought it was a little bizarre considering they kind of looked alike. But Ann was always trying to get close to April and everyone in the office knew that, knew Ann craved April’s acceptance for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since April’s back was to Jen, it’s Ann who spots the older woman once she pulls back from hug. Her eyes light up in fear and it looks like she says something to April because the younger girl takes off into another room without turning back. Ann slowly approaches Jen with a cautious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jennifer! How are you today?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just peachy. Where’s Knope?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right through th-“ Ann begins but Jen just ignores her and walks right into the conference room Leslie was waiting inside of. She’s thankful Leslie offers to lower the blinds so Jen won’t end up unconsciously looking around the windowed room for April. Instead she can focus on work and finish what she’s started here so she could leave Pawnee once and for all and forget everything and everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     After two hours of hearing Leslie yap nonstop, Jen is finally freed. She feels faint (probably from crying all night and barely eating for the past 24 hours) when she stands but still squares her shoulders and gives Leslie a professional, firm handshake before heading out. She glances at April’s desk on the way out and of course, the younger woman is nowhere to be found. Jen doesn’t know if she’s more relieved or disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen doesn’t know if it’s her fatigue, lack of food consumption, or a mess of feelings swirling around in her head but when she passes Ann Perkins outside she can’t help but say something stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want with her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry? Who are we talking about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “April.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! Right, you saw us this morning! She was upset, she wouldn’t say why, but she’s never opened up to me before like that. It was… nice. Wait, do you know why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m leaving now.” Jen quickly rushes to her car and drives away.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The next time Jen goes into the office it’s a week later and April is at her desk but there is a large man sitting next to her, so closely it looks like he is practically sitting on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen has to stab her nails into her palm to stop herself from saying or doing something stupid when April laughs out loud obnoxiously and places a hand on the man’s shoulder. Jen recognizes him, Andy Dwyer. Andy blushes and when April isn’t looking, he looks at her the way April used to look at Jen and that makes Jen want to throw up or set the building on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meeting today required the entire parks department to be there and the idea of having April be in the same room as her, eyes glued on her as she presents, was driving her to insanity. Jen did make sure to unbutton some buttons of her blouse and fix her lipstick before walking in, for no reason at all of course. But when she gets into the room, April is nowhere in sight. She keeps glancing at the door as she presents, thinking April will come bursting through any second but she doesn’t show up at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trailing out of the room with the rest of the park's staff after the meeting, Jen hears the sound of April’s sweet laugh again and sees her still situated at her desk with Andy. It’s as if they hadn’t moved in the entire hour the meeting was going on. Jen’s blood was boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She passes by April’s desk quickly and marches out of the office without another glance back. What Jen misses is the way April stares longingly at her and ditches Andy as soon as the older woman is out of earshot.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It has been a long work week and the end of her not-relationship was definitely making it a lot harder. So when the clock strikes 5, Jen grabs her purse and drives over to a local bar. She’s one martini in when some occupies the stool next to her. At first, her heart starts to race at the sight of brown hair through her peripheral vision but when she finally looks up she comes face to face with Ann Perkins.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fancy seeing you here!” Ann’s sports a bright smile but it’s clear she’s nervous. Jen loves that she has this effect on people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen just hums in agreement and looks back towards her drink, hoping Ann would get the message and leave her alone but she stays situated in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If we had known you wanted to grab a drink, we would have invited you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We?” Jen looks up at Ann in confusion when her head snaps towards the front door of the bar opening and the entire parks department strolls in, loud and obnoxious as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as Jen was going to grab her bag and leave, she sees April walk in with Andy following close behind her like a lost puppy. April and Jen lock eyes. April’s expression is neutral as she looks away and grabs Andy’s arm, throwing them into a booth together and making sure April sat in the seat that faced Jen’s direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently Ann had been speaking to her this entire time and when she looks back at the woman, Jen sparks an idea. She glances at April one more time, making sure the younger woman was looking as she scooted closer to Ann. She smiled widely at whatever Ann was saying, even throwing her head back in laughter, and placing her hand on Ann’s thigh after giggling at something that was definitely not funny. Jen knows April is still watching, and can feel those brown eyes burning into her, so she goes in for the kill. She interrupts whatever Ann was telling her and lifts her hand, tucking a piece of Ann’s short brown hair behind her ear. Ann finally shuts up and her eyes go wide, staring back at Jen in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh, um. What is happening?” Ann nervously laughs but she doesn’t move away either.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know. What do you want to happen?” Jen gives her practiced bedroom eyes and lowers her voice, revealing in the way Ann nervously swallows but loving more the way she can see April white knuckling the wooden table beneath her finger tips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m um- straight. Yeah no I’m um straight.” Ann nods her head but again, does not move away from Jen’s touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever kissed a girl?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. But I support gay people! All gay people! I support you if you… um like girls or whatever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to kiss you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! I uh, I um. I don’t… I don’t know actually.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about… just on the cheek then?” Jen leans in and whispers in her ear, glancing over at April who is staring daggers into both Jen and Ann. If looks could kill, both Jen and Ann would be horizontal in a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.” Ann quickly says and it surprises Jen, she expects the other woman to chicken out but is pleasantly surprised because this will help her cause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen leans back in seat, biting the inside of her cheek when she finally takes a look at Ann who seems breathless from Jen’s teasing. Jen almost feels bad for using Ann like this but she also doesn’t really care. The only person she really cares about is sitting in a booth about 5 feet away and wasting her time with a sorry excuse for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     She slowly leans in and places an innocent kiss on Ann’s cheek. It’s a little too close to Ann’s mouth and from where April is sitting, it looks like they actually kissed on the mouth. Ann and Jen pull away from each other when the sound of glass breaking is heard within the bar. They turn their heads and stare at the offender. April. The younger woman was gripping her beer bottle so tightly as she watched the scene unfold that it crumbled away right into her hands. Glass shard fell onto the table and April looked down at her now bleeding skin. Cursing loudly, April abruptly gets up from her seat and storms into the women’s room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ann starts to get up but Jen puts a hand on her shoulder and forces her back in her stool. Jen can’t be bothered by the look of confusion the woman gives her because Andy gets up as well to go after April but Jen is faster. She rises from her seat, stopping in front of the tall man and glares at him. And like most, Andy folds and is instantly intimidated by her. Jen wants to laugh but instead just rolls her eyes as walks away.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Jen opens the door and April is standing at the mirror, the sink running as she tries to pick the glass pieces away from her hand. The water running in the sink is so loud and April too busy wincing in pain, cursing under her breath, that she doesn’t even notice Jen has walked in until the woman stops beside her. Her sweet perfume hits April like a garbage truck and when Jen tries to touch her hand, April pulls away. When brown eyes lock with blue they are so full of anger and hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t need your help.” April’s voice is so cold, it actually makes Jen wince.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be stupid.” Jen tries again, her voice lighter than she intended. She moves towards April again but the younger woman takes a step back. Now Jen was frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not the stupid one in this situation.” April's dark, angry eyes now start to well up with tears. Jen's heart breaks at the sight but she doesn’t like her facade slipping. Jen can’t be weak especially because she knows April could break her and she’d let her do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “April.” Jen warns her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just leave. Please. Just leave me alone.” April quickly looks away and starts pulling glass out of her hand again, biting at the bottom of her lip to try to hide her pain but Jen has had enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen swiftly approaches the girl and roughly grabs April's wrist. They engage in an intense staring match, seeing who will crack first, and it’s April who lets out a sigh and rolls her eyes. Jen then relaxes, loosening her grip as she starts gently pulling glass away and blotting away the blood with a paper towel. It’s so quiet that Jen is afraid April will hear how violently her heart is beating inside her chest. When the glass is all gone, Jen looks up at April to see the younger woman studying her with sad eyes. Then she pulls away again, moving to run her hand under the stream of water.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I got it from here.” April says, making sure to avoid eye contact with Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need to apply pressure.” Jen finds herself saying softly, turning off the water and grabbing a fresh paper towel and pressing it into April’s palm. She doesn't move away from April though. Her hand pressing into the other woman’s. They are standing so close together that Jen can catch April biting down on the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don’t you just go back to your girlfriend?” April bites but Jen can see the uncertainty in those brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You and I both know Ann is straight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still kissed her though.” April presses, her brow furrowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t know you were watching.” Jen tries to play coy but April sees right through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You knew I was watching! You’re such a bitch.” April can’t help but chuckle and it’s music to Jen’s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmmm. Yeah?” Jen smiles as she tucks a piece of April’s brown hair behind her ear. The action catches them both off guard and Jen steps away when she realizes they unconsciously moved their bodies to press closer together. Before April could say something, Jen is turning on her heel and practically running out of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     After their moment in the bathroom, Jen avoids April at all costs. Sure, it was fun making April jealous but Jen can’t risk another close call like what happened in the bar. Jen almost gave into weakness. She almost forgot who she was and what was expected of her. Jen Barkley wasn’t weak.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Jen thought that avoiding April would be difficult but it turns out, it is much easier than she expected but that was because April was avoiding her as well. Hours turn into days which turns into weeks and soon Jen only has a week left in Pawnee. She doesn’t know what to feel and frankly she doesn’t want to feel anything so she buries herself in work and drinks herself into oblivion at night (in the comfort of her apartment of course because she’ll never step foot in that bar again).
    </p>
    <p>
     She had just finished some annoying paperwork and was about to dive into some emails when there was a knock on her door. Her eyebrow rose at the sight of the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ann Perkins.” She said plainly, sitting back in her seat and eyeing the nervous woman. “I’m starting to think you’re a little obsessed with me. Can I help you with something? I’m pretty stacked at the moment.” Jen teases and the other woman falls into a mess of nervous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh sorry! Well Leslie just sent me down here to give you this.” Ann walks over and pulls out a white envelope from her back cardigan pocket, sliding it across to Jen. “It’s for Pawnee’s annual fundraiser. It's a really fun event and the money goes towards the public school system”.
    </p>
    <p>
     “While that’s very nice, I’ll be out of here by Sunday.” Jen doesn’t even open the envelope, sliding it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s this Friday!” Ann smiles, sliding it back again. Jen sighs and accepts the envelope, placing it closer to herself. “So should we put you down as a yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well I guess so.” Jen gives her a tight lipped smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perfect! I’ll let Leslie know! And will you be bringing a plus one or…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” Jen quickly says and then her phone buzzes next to her. She glances down and her eyebrow raises at the message. “You know what? Yeah. I’ll be bringing a plus one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ann looks surprised by her answer and just nods before fleeing the office. As she closes the door she looks over at April who was waiting for Ann outside. Ann just gives her a sad look and April immediately understands. April balls her hands into fists and storms off down the hall but Ann is close behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “April! Wait!” Ann tries to keep her voice down considering they are still near Jen’s office.
    </p>
    <p>
     April ignores her and continues on. There was a sizable distance between her and Ann but when the elevator took too long to arrive, she made a beeline for the stairwell. Her momentary change in plans is enough for Ann to catch up with her and is hot on her heels as they descend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “April! Come on! Stop! We need to talk about this!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s nothing to talk about!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You obviously really care about her! A lot! And she’s leaving in seven days, April! Seven!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you kissed her!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For the millionth time, she kissed ME on the CHEEK! And if anything it just assured me I’m straight! But we’ve already been over thar!! What this is really about is your feeling for Jennifer! You care about her! Admit it!! And the fact that she’s bringing a plus one is killing you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t care! Leave me alone Ann!” April shouts but she’s so busy trying to escape the older woman that she misses a whole 3 stairs and falls, her knee painfully colliding with the cold cement floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “April!!!” Ann catches up to her and kneels down to assess the younger girl. April is tightly gripping onto her right knee and closing her eyes in pain. “Will you let me roll up your pant leg?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Ann, stop trying to get in my pants!” April says in an annoyed tone but Ann knows her well enough by now to know she’s joking. But then April winces, her breath catching in her throat when she moves her leg the wrong way. Ann makes the decision to just roll up her right pant leg and gently studies the area.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think anything is majorly broken but let’s just get it x-rayed to make sure.” Ann says and April loudly groans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate hospitals!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah yeah yeah. Let’s get you up so we can get that checked out.” Ann tries to pull April up but the yelps in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck! Ow! Ann I can’t even get up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hence the need for an x-ray!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re so annoying! You know that?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Amidst their screaming match, the door beside them opens and Andy walks in with headphones over his ears. Once he spots the two women, he slides them off and looks at them in concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is going on here? Oh my god. Ann, did you push April down the stairs!?” Andy asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!” “Yes!” Ann and April say at the same time and Ann just glares down at the younger woman who was now smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She fell. I did not push her!” Ann argues but Andy doesn’t look convinced. “Can you just carry her to my car? We have to go to the hospital to get her leg checked out and she can’t put any pressure on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don’t you carry me, Ann?” April teases as Andy swoops down to easily carry her bridal style.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re the same size, April.” Ann retorts, holding the door open for Andy to walk through.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you just call me fat?!” April fakes offense.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No! If anything you just called me fat!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two continue to bicker and don’t even notice the way Andy is blushing being this close to April.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Crap! I left my car keys in Leslie’s office. You guys go. I’ll meet you in a couple of minutes.” Ann jobs back towards the stairs and disappears behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andy strikes up a conversation with April, that the girl only entertains because she doesn’t have a lot of choices right now. He’s boring her out of her mind about his band or something and April is pretty much zoning out so neither of them see Jen down the hall who watches Andy literally whisk April away in his arms.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “I’m so fucking happy you’re here.” Jen is driving to the fundraiser with Wanda in her passenger seat. The red head is wearing a stunning silk dress that matches her hair and Jen went to a silk piece as well but the color black. It was a funny coincidence that Jen’s heels were red and Wanda’s black so it was like they were matching on purpose. It was probably best friend telepathy considering they had been attached by the hip since they were teenagers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m so fucking happy I’m here too.” Wanda smiles over at her friend and then pulls down the sun visor down to reapply her lipstick. “Would it be bad if I said I was a little relieved to get away from Vis and the boys? I mean I love them dearly but oh my gosh I’m kind of going insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re the strongest soldier there ever was, Wanda. A boy mom to twins AND straight? I mean I don’t know if I could ever be strong enough for that.” Jen laughs and so does Wanda, smacking her arm in the process. “I’m kidding. You know I love Billy and Tommy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Because they love their Auntie Jen very very much. When I told them I was coming to visit they wouldn’t stop asking when you were coming back to DC.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sunday.” Jen said and it was like it finally hit her, like her time here in Pawnee was actually almost over.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what happened to that girl you were telling me about? What was her name? Oh! April!” Wanda eyes her friend, who at the mere mention of April squirms in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s over. It ended a month ago.” Jen keeps her eyes on the road and schools her expression from her overly observant friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really? You talked about her all the time. Literally every time we spoke on the phone, you brought her up. It sounded pretty serious to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did not. And you know I don’t do serious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well… maybe you should.” Wanda suggests and that makes Jen’s eyes snap over to her before back on to the road ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s not me, Wanda. I don’t do relationships.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why though? I mean seriously, why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because why would I waste my time with one person when I could sleep with as many people as I want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But is that enough? What about love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about you shut up. We’re here.” Jen says as she parks. Wanda smiles at her friend’s deflection because she knows the other woman too well, knows the truth is hiding in there and begging to come out. Literally.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you at least point her out to me? I wanna see if she’s as hot as you made her seem.” Wanda teases and Jen just shakes her head as she exits her car and tosses her keys to the valet boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The banquet hall was much bigger than Jen had expected and the place was packed. Jen had no idea that this many people live in Pawnee, let alone worked for the tiny city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen makes conversation with a couple important people she recognizes before her and Wanda look for their assigned table. They find table 3 and Jen mentally curses whatever higher power is controlling her life because of course she’s sat with the entire parks department.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ooooo! Looking hot, Jen!” Leslie says just like someone’s mom who is desperately trying to be cool as she gets up from her seat and brings Jen into an uncomfortably tight hug. “And who is this?” Leslie is like a bottle of joy, bouncing off the walls, as she moves from hugging Jen to Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m Wanda. Jen’s-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Andy, I could’ve walked here myself.” April says irritated as her and Andy emerge from a crowd, him still carrying her bridal style as his hands also juggled April’s crutches.
    </p>
    <p>
     He sets April down in her seat and the younger woman doesn’t even thank him, just shoos him away. She doesn’t even realize she’s drawn the attention of the table until she looks around at everyone confused. She then notices Jen standing across from her and sits straighter in her seat, adjusting the black jumpsuit with the plunging neckline she had on. Her eyes catch red hair and she stares at Wanda, at how close Wanda is standing next to Jen. Her eyes flicker between the two. Wanda realizes who she is and sparks an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m Wanda.” She settles on, saying loud enough for April to hear, and smiles over at a beaming Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re gorgeous, Wanda! Do you model? Or act? Your face looks like it was chiseled by angels.” Leslie starts rambling and fawning over the woman and Ben has to apologize and pull Leslie back towards her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda just laughs and places her hand on the small of Jen’s back, who looks over at her friend in confusion. Wanda glances at April, making sure their eyes lock, before moving in closer to whisper in Jen’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She really is hot. Jen, I didn’t know you liked them young. Loving this cougar era for you!” Wanda says and Jen throws her head back in laughter and pushes playfully at the red head's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     They take their seats and dinner is served. Their table is full of light conversation, mostly led by Leslie who is a professional yapper. Wanda purposefully scooted her seat closer to Jen and kept leaning into her personal space. It wasn’t out of the ordinary since they had been super close for over two decades now but Jen did sense something was up when Wanda gave her an exaggerated laugh and put her hand over Jen’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Helping you out.” Wanda smiled and quickly glanced over at April, who was ignoring Andy and stabbing her steak fork into the poor table. “And it’s working by the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t need your help if there’s nothing to be helping with in the first place.” Jen rolls her eyes and goes back to picking at the salad in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of metal hitting glaces is heard at the front of the room on the stage and everyone turns their attention to the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you all again for being here tonight for such a great cause. We have a lot of auctions up for grabs so let’s just get started! And remember everyone, this is all for the kids and no donation is too big or too small!” He says and is given a clipboard by his assistant. “Alright! So first up we have the parks department!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “WOOO!” Leslie gets up from her seat, yelling and fist pumping in the air and it’s both Ann and Ben who have to ease her back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes! We love the enthusiasm! So they are auctioning off an evening with April Ludgate, Ron Sawnson’s assistant and the office’s youth outreach manager! April loves horror movies, Li'l Sebastian, and making grown men cry. Wait, is that right?” The mayor reads off the paper and then looks over at this assistant who shrugs. “Okay! So that’s April! Get up here April!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The crowd starts to cheer as April gets up from her seat. Andy offers to help but she glares at him as she grabs her crutches. Jen on the other hand has had her mouth open in shock for at least the past 5 minutes and only closes it when Wanda shoulders her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s start the bidding at $100!” The mayor smiles once April is up on stage with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “$100!” Andy shouts, proudly waving his paddle in the air. April rolls her eyes but so does Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “$200!” An older man towards the back of the room says and Jen whips around to stare at him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then more people are speaking up and it’s all creepy older men. Jen’s blood boils.
    </p>
    <p>
     “$300!” “$400!” “$500!” “$550!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “$600!” Andy stands, looking worried as he battles the older gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “$1000” A female voice rings out ahead of the park's table and a woman around Jen’s age stands, proudly waving her paddle in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andy sits down, dejected as the room erupts in cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you gonna do something?! That woman is hot as hell!!” Wanda says as she jabs Jen in the back, Jen looking back at her swatting her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wow! $1000!” The mayor happily announces. “Going once!”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Jen looks back towards the stage April is looking right at her. At first glance her expression is unreadable but then those brown eyes tell all. They always do.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Going twice! And so-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “$5000!” Jen shoots up in her seat, her heart beating outside of her body as everyone turns to her. It’s silent for a moment before the crowd gets even louder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Golly gosh! That’s the biggest single donation we have received in Pawnee history!” The mayor smiles widely and the older woman ahead of Jen looks back at her before rolling her eyes and sitting back down in defeat. “Going once! Going twice! Sold! To that lady in the back! Congratulations!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone is cheering and everyone is looking at Jen but the only person she can focus on is April, who doesn’t even crack a smile as she exits the stage and out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen quickly follows her, having difficulty doing so with so many people trying to stop her to thank or congratulate her. When she finally feels the cold breeze of the night air, she finds April sitting on the steps right outside the door. Jen catches her breath before she sits down right next to her. April looks over and shakes her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re the last person I want to see right now.” April’s voice is shaky and her gaze is focused on her own shoes below her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s no way to talk to someone who just donated 5k for you.” Jen teases but April doesn’t take the bait.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well no one told you to do that.” April huffs in frustration but Jen isn’t deterred.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What happened to your leg?” Jen changes the subject, looking down at April's knee in a brace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I fell." April decides to keep it vague and the worry in Jen's blue eyes actually piss her off. "Why do you even care? It’s not like you have a heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I… I have a heart.” Jen finds herself saying, her voice much softer than it’s ever been in her life, and it makes April look up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No you don’t. You made that super clear.” April’s brow furrows. “I can’t do this with you right now. I’m going back.” April goes to grab her crutches and stand but Jen’s next words stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Back to your boyfriend?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Andy. Right? I honestly think you can do a lot better than him, by the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t get a say in who I see, by the way.” April shoots back. “And you’re one to talk. Bringing that woman here with you. Who is she anyway? Another booty call? Another woman you’ll take into the palm of your hands and crush the living life out of?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s my best friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that what you’re calling it these days? Whatever Jen. I don’t care who or what you do with your life. Goodbye.” April successfully stands and goes to tuck her crutches under arms when Jen pushes them to the floor. The younger woman looks at her with a mixture of anger and shock as Jen stands to face her. “WHAT THE FUCK, JEN?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have a heart.” Jen insists but confusion paints April’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Weird fucking way of showing it by shoving my crutches to the floor!” April tries to crouch down to pick them up and Jen groans before retrieving them from the ground and giving them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have a heart.” Jen repeats.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah I heard you the fucking first time. Now move out of my way-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “NO! I have a heart, April. I have a heart and it only beats for you.” Jen lets out a shaky breath before moving closer to April, only a breath away from each other. The younger woman’s eyes widened at the closeness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen. What are you doing?” April sounds breathless as she stares into blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What I was too much of a coward to do a month ago.” Jen’s hands are shaking as she caresses April’s cheeks, admiring the beauty for the younger woman before moving in so their lips only brush. “Is this okay?” Jen asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just kiss me you idiot.” April says and Jen smiles, closing the gap and revealing in the fact that April was smiling too.
    </p>
    <p>
     April drops her crutches to the floor again and clings onto Jen for support, who is surprisingly strong and is able to center April which also consisted of pressing their bodies as close as possible. April deepens the kiss when she slips her tongue into Jen’s mouth and the older woman audibly groans at the feeling. April’s hands travel south and grip onto Jen’s ass as the kiss slows. They pull away for a much needed breath but keep their foreheads connected. They open their eyes and April goes in 3 more times to peck Jen’s lips, to know this is real to know she isn’t dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen knows in that moment, finally kissing and being with April again, that she has wasted an entire month of her life that could’ve been spent with this amazing woman. Jen was so afraid of commitment but if this is what commitment looked like, then Jen would run to it with open arms. Jen feels so stupid but so happy to be given this second chance and she was not going to fuck it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen pecks April’s lips once more before caressing her cheek again and looking deep within those beautiful big eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “April?” Jen speaks up and hardly recognizes her own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” April looks at her with so much hope and admiration that Jen’s smile only widens. Knows what she needs to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry. I love you.” Jen’s voice is so sure as she nods, still holding April’s face in her hands. “I want to be with you. I’m still leaving for DC in two days but I want to figure this out. I wanna do this… with you.” Jen lets out a shaky breath she’s been holding in and April responds with a cocky smile that only makes Jen relax, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry I didn’t hear that. Can you repeat?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you.” Jen can’t help but laugh at the younger woman’s antics.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh? What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you!” Jen says again, still laughing and shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry. It’s so loud out here.” It was dead silent outside. “Could you speak up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I LOVE YOU, APRIL LUDGATE!” Jen shouts and April’s face is graced with a sweet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh okay! I think I heard you that time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you.” Jen is literally giggling like a school girl and April is reveling in the fact because she knows Jen doesn’t act like this with anyone else and a strong sense of pride blooms in April’s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I'm pretty sure you love me. Oh wait, yeah. I’m sure.” April brings Jen in for another kiss but the older woman pulls back, a pout on her lips. “What???”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Isn’t there something you want to tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah! I… think we should end this.” April says and it makes Jen dramatically roll her eyes and push away but April forces her body back, knocking the wind out of Jen. “I’m so in love with you, Jennifer Barkley.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tension and want increasingly build between them as April stares at her with a newfound hunger. April grabs the side of Jen’s neck and kisses her way up over her pulse point, up her jaw, and finally bringing Jen into another heated kiss. They both moan too loud into the kiss, their hands everywhere. They don’t even know how long they’ve been outside kissing but it had to be long enough that the event had concluded and now people were filing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only reason they stop kissing is because they hear a loud cheering from behind them and it’s the park department beaming at the two women.
    </p>
    <p>
     “FINALLY!” Ann practically skips up to them and gives them both a hug. Leslie slams into them as well, forcing them into a group hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh this is so great!!! Aw my little April! You’re all grown up! Finding love! Being in love! Love is so great! Let me tell you about-” and again it’s Ann who gently brings Leslie away from the two women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda follows shortly behind and pats Jen on the back before telling her that she’s catching a ride with Ann to the train station and departs with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andy gives them a sad smile and disappears and then April and Jen are back in their little world.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come home with me?” Jen asks, kissing April on her cheek and making the younger woman blush.
    </p>
    <p>
     “To do what exactly, Ms. Barkley?” April teases but that confidence melts away when Jen whispers low in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well since you're injured I was thinking I could ride your face all night.” Jen makes sure to bite down on April’s earlobe which does the trick of making her melt in her arms. All April can do is nod her head and Jen is whisking her away. Making a show, in front of Andy of course, of carrying April with ease and buckling her in the passenger seat but not before leaning over and kissing her deeply and practically crawling into her lap. The only reason Jen doesn’t is because the valet guys cleared his throat and said something about them causing traffic.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The sun was peeking through the curtains and right into Jen’s eyes. She slowly blinked, her eyes opened and rolled over when she bumped right into a smooth back. She was confused for a second before last night started coming back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kissing April. Telling April she loves her. Finally hearing April loves her back. Bringing her home. Getting her wish of riding April’s face not once but four times. And then bringing April over the edge over and over and over and over until April was begging her to stop and fell asleep in the warmth and safety of Jen’s arms.

     April started to stir and she turned around, facing Jen. Her eyes were still closed and she was obviously still so sleepy but Jen found it incredibly adorable. She smiled as she brushed April’s brown hair away from her eyes and started leaving kisses all over her face until she had April fully awake and giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t mind waking up like this every morning.” April said and it brought Jen back to reality. The reality that Jen was leaving the very next day. It was like April was reading her mind because she grabbed Jen’s hands and brought them up to her mouth to kiss her knuckles, effectively easing her mind.

     “So Ben asked me to go to DC with him as his assistant. It won't start until next month but I’m gonna take it.” April feels a weight lifted off her shoulder finally being able to tell Jen this but then there is literal weight on her shoulders because Jen pushes April onto her back and straddles her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait! Seriously?!” Jen’s smile is so infectious that it makes April smile too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, seriously. Is that… okay with you?” April cautiously asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh that's more than okay with me.” Jen’s voice dropped several octaves as she took in the naked woman before her. Running her hands over her bare chest, over her shoulders, until one hand is over April’s throat. Both women grinning at the action. But then April can’t take how inviting Jen’s lips look so she abruptly sits up, wrapping her arms tightly around Jen’s waist and practically shoving her tongue down her throat.

    <p>
     “I don’t know if I can wait a month.” April pants, her eyes dark as she takes in Jen’s own dark eyes and sex tousled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Neither can I.” Jen shakes her head, grinding down into April’s lap and April’s hands gravitating to the soft skin of her ass and encouraging her to keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gonna talk to Ron about leaving early.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Good plan.” Jen is trying her best to listen but her mouth falls open in pleasure when April’s fingers swipes through her folds before retracting them and makes a show of shoving the digits into her own mouth, closing her eyes in pleasure. April has become obsessed with the taste of Jen and isn’t kidding when she could eat her out forever, and the younger woman plans to. Jen audibly moans at the sight, becoming wetter by the second. April slips her fingers out with a pop and before moving them to Jen's clit with practiced ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I guess I’ll just stay in a motel until my apartment is ready.” April says between her own strangled breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be stupid. You’ll stay with me. My place is big enough for the both of us.” Jen looks at April with a serious expression, harshly biting down on her bottom lip as April’s fingers quicken their pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know I don’t know how long I’ll be in DC. It might be a long, long time.” April teases but is pushed harshly onto her back again with Jen towering over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I hope it is.” Jen moves down to whisper in her ear. “Now be a good girl and let me ride your fingers."
