All the spotlight—the center of the main story—revolves around them; they are the principal actresses and the rarest sopranos. Maria Callas, the absolute primadonna. A revolutionary voice, intense dramatic acting, and a legendary reputation for being difficult. She changed opera forever.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Nellie Melba, just as famous, gave rise to the term “throwing a tantrum” (meltdown, according to legend). An icon of bel canto, and Adelina Patti, one of the highest-paid singers in history. She demanded sets, salaries, and reverence.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>What did they have in common? Beyond their immense talent, the world revolved around them. Everyone talked about how difficult they were, but people simply couldn’t stay away.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha was six years old when the concept of prima donna settled into her brain like a little fly. It wasn’t hard, considering that her mother, Liliana, was at the center of every successful opera and musical.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha remembers seeing her mother on stage, applauded by thousands of people, being the center of the world. That was what Agatha wanted. To be the center of the world like her mother; she was naturally what they call a Diva.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>A diva of theater and musicals. When Agatha and her mother were together, they practiced music and songs; Liliana used to say that Agatha had inherited the gift for music. And her father, Edward, a businessman in the entertainment industry, loved the idea of having his wife and daughter as the stars of his life. Their family was perfect in its own way and was Agatha’s safe harbor.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>But everything changed on Agatha’s seventh birthday. Agatha’s birthdays were special—she was an only child, so it was always a big celebration. But that day began differently, silently.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>The young omega got up, walking slowly; the house was silent. Her mother had a play in another city, and both of her parents had gone to New York for Liliana’s play. Agatha remembers: “We’ll be back in the morning for your birthday.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>The house in Los Angeles seemed bigger than ever. Agatha went downstairs and saw two maids whispering.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“It was horrible.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“How awful.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>As soon as the two saw Agatha, they immediately stopped talking.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“What’s going on?” the young girl asked. The maids said nothing. Then the front door opened; Agatha’s father came in. His perfect suit from yesterday was wrinkled. The blazer hung over his shoulder. His shirt was rumpled, and his head was bandaged, a little blood seeping from the dressing.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Dad?” Agatha asked. The man finally looked at his daughter. And the question that was lodged in her throat—</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Where is Mommy?” the thin voice.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“I… I’m so sorry, my love.” Edward crouched down to his daughter’s height; Agatha’s eyes filled with tears, and then she threw herself into her father’s arms, crying, the two of them holding each other.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha’s mother’s funeral passed like a blur. It was everywhere: “Absolute diva of the theater dies in traffic accident.” The gate of their house was covered in flowers, as was every door of every theater where her mother had performed.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha remembers standing beside her father at the end of the funeral, looking at her mother’s grave filled with flowers. Edward placed a hand on his daughter’s shoulder and turned. It was definitive: from then on, life would be just the two of them.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center"><strong>12 Years Later</strong></p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You might be an idiot, but not enough to miss my party—my welcome party for my new stepmother, Val.”</p><p align="justify">The young blonde omega raised her brand-new iPhone into the air, going live directly from her mansion in Los Angeles. The sun shone intensely, and her infinity-edge pool was full of cool, influential people. Just like herself.</p><p align="justify">“Val, I’m doing this because I want you to be soooo welcome! Our family—after all—now it’ll be the three of us! Me, you, and Dad!”</p><p align="justify">Sarah, Agatha’s girlfriend, approached with a smile. The blonde wore an open white button-down shirt over a bikini and held two colorful cocktails.</p><p align="justify">“Love, put the live aside; let’s have fun before your stepmother witch arrives.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed, setting the phone aside, and traded a quick kiss.</p><p align="justify">“You know, I don’t mind if he gets married again, but does it have to be with the tackiest woman in every corner of this country?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center"><em>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha and her father continued life after her mother’s death; they lived their days normally. Of course, Edward ended up giving Agatha a bit more freedom, which resulted in huge credit card dents, extravagant last-minute trips, the phone of the year. A gap year before starting college.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>And of course, studying at the incredible, expensive, and completely exclusive arts school of Los Angeles—of course Agatha became daddy’s little girl. After all, she no longer had her mother, and her father tried every day to make up for that absence.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>It was on Agatha’s sixteenth birthday that everything changed. She came downstairs, and as always, the breakfast table was set with all her favorite things.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Good morning, Dad!”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Good morning, princess. Happy birthday.” Agatha smiled and hugged her father.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Here’s your present.” Edward raised a small box. Agatha opened it, and as soon as she realized what it was, she screamed, throwing herself into her father’s arms and hugging him.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“THANK YOU, THANK YOU!”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Agatha, seriously, you need to have sense behind the wheel.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“I know, Dad, I know. Didn’t I pass the driving test?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“After failing fourteen times.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Minor detail. Where is it?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha smiled; Edward stood up, and the two walked to the garage—and there it was. A white convertible with a huge bow on the hood. Agatha jumped with joy.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“It’s so beautiful! I loved it.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Edward smiled and then put his hands in his pockets.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>“Why don’t you take your old man for a spin?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Oh my God, don’t tell me you’re needy.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Come on, Aggie—milkshakes at the Star.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Do you know how much sugar is in that, Dad?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Oh, you care about sugar now?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Of course. Enough not to lose my perfect body.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Edward smiled and kissed his daughter’s forehead.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Come on, princess, it’ll be a nice ride.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha then walked toward the driver’s seat and got in; the car had beige leather seats, with a screen that connected directly to her phone. Edward fastened his seat belt and asked his daughter to do the same.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Well, now you just bring the key close to the sensor.” Agatha smiled; she brought it closer, the engine’s growl vibrated, making her heart race. Agatha stepped on the accelerator and turned out of her driveway, driving happily.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Careful, Agatha.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Sorry, I was excited.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Eyes on the road.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha sighed, driving and enjoying the ride with her father; some conversations came up, and Edward even put music on through Agatha’s phone. Then, after a few minutes of driving, the young woman parked; a few minutes later, her father returned with a combo—the usual one.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>A strawberry milkshake for Agatha, a sandwich with lettuce and no pickles; and his was a chocolate milkshake and a sandwich with some fries.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>“You know, Dad, life is very good,” said Agatha, sighing as she sipped her milkshake.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Especially yours, right?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“I can’t complain,” Agatha mocked.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“So I want to talk to you.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha sighed.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Hmm, I knew it.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“What?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Random outings, childhood milkshakes—Dad, you’re not subtle at all.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Right, I know that, so listen to me.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“What is it? Credit card again? I already said it won’t happen again; I just needed that bag.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Although that is a problem, miss, this is actually a good thing.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Oh yeah? What?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“I’m seeing someone.” Agatha turned her face toward her father.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“My God, you still have sex?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Agatha Marie!”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Sorry, sorry—it’s just that you take so much heart medication.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“The point is,” said Edward, raising his hand slightly to speak,</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“I’m happy. She’s a great woman; she’s beautiful, intelligent. She has a son your age. I think you’ll get along.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha sighed.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“She’s not my mother.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Of course not, princess; your mother is irreplaceable. But things go on, you know?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Of course…” said Agatha, turning her face to the side, holding back the tears that wanted to treacherously run down her face.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Things go on.” It’s true. But when the “thing” is your mother, it’s very hard. Agatha’s father was calm and rational. She never fought with him, and she wondered what her life would have been like with her mother. She wasn’t there when her first menstruation arrived; she wasn’t there to explain an omega’s cycle. Her father was an alpha, and that task fell to the nanny. Sometimes Agatha just wanted to have her mother to fight with during adolescence.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>That same day, Agatha dropped her father off at home and ran every possible red light. That resulted in fifty-six tickets and a punishment that lasted less than eight hours.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Valentina Allegra de Fontaine was different from all her father’s girlfriends—blondes who loved fashion, were funny, and always followed Agatha everywhere, and who, of course, never lasted six months in the relationship. First, she dressed as if she had walked out of the tackiest section of a common department store.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>She was a teacher—worse, a university physics professor. Agatha wasn’t stupid, but physics was one of the things she hated most while in school. And of course, unlike all the others, Val wasn’t interested in and didn’t want to know about the world of fashion and art; those things simply weren’t part of her universe, period.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>It was a shock when Agatha discovered that her father’s relationship with Val wasn’t a six-month relationship but a two-year one! Two years of lying. Her son, Rick, was always out of the picture, which was good, but Agatha had to put up with him at year-end parties.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>It didn’t take long for the obvious to become reality. Val and Agatha’s father got married. And Val moved into their house. The paintings that had once belonged to her mother, everywhere, were put away and gave place to the wedding photos of Val and Edward—photos in which Agatha most of the time appeared sulky.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>One day, Agatha came home from school; Val was on the couch doing crossword puzzles</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Agatha, welcome!”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Hi.” Agatha said without much enthusiasm.</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Would you like to do crossword puzzles with me?”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha looked Val up and down. And replied, “I’d rather overdose.”</em></p><p align="justify"><em>“No, I’m going to my room. Thank you, Val,” and she went upstairs.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center"><em>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</em></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha!” Sarah called.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry, I got distracted.” Sarah smiled and kissed her again.</p><p align="justify">“You’re always distracted.” The kisses intensified. Agatha turned her face away.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t want to…” Agatha said, pouting. Sarah sighed.</p><p align="justify">“Did I do something wrong?”</p><p align="justify">“No… you didn’t. I’m just stressed.”</p><p align="justify">Sarah sighed, a slight displeasure in her tone that made Agatha shrink inwardly.  — Did I disappoint her?</p><p align="justify">“It’s okay, bunny, but next time you won’t escape.” And she kissed her again. Agatha then stood up. </p><p align="justify">“Let’s liven up this party. You,” Agatha said, pointing at two Alphas in the pool, </p><p align="justify">“let’s give my stepmother a very Hollywood-style welcome.”  Then the idea clicked in people’s minds. The target? The pile of suitcases in the living room, with all of Val’s clothes quickly being opened and thrown into the pool, along with her own suitcases. Happy to cause damage, Agatha raised her phone high, starting a new Live.</p><p align="justify">“THAT’S IT!”</p><p align="justify">“AGATHA MARIE HARKNESS.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha looked. Too early. Much too early. Edward had returned. He was standing at the door, a furious look that Agatha would never have imagined her father could direct at her. Behind him stood Val, shocked, staring at her suitcases floating.</p><p align="justify">“OUT! EVERYONE OUT OF HERE!” Edward shouted, and quickly everyone disappeared as if by magic. Sarah exchanged a quick look with Agatha before leaving.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">“I am sure, Agatha, absolutely sure that I raised you better than this! You may have had everything, but I did not raise you to be a cruel woman!”</p><p align="justify">Edward’s voice echoed through the room that was too big, walls too high, too silent to contain that explosion. Agatha was sitting on the edge of the bed, her hands resting on her knees, trembling fingers gripping the fabric of the short dress. She kept her gaze fixed on the floor, as if the lines of the carpet could absorb the violence of the words.</p><p align="justify">Forty minutes. </p><p align="justify">Forty minutes of uninterrupted reprimand.<br/>Forty minutes listening to every mistake, every excess, every disappointment being placed on her shoulders like successive weights.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry… I…”</p><p align="justify">The sentence came out low, broken, almost childish. Edward did not soften his tone. </p><p align="justify">“No, you don’t owe me apologies. You owe apologies to Val, and you know what? You are not going back to the arts school to finish the year.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha lifted her head in an instinctive reflex, eyes wide, the air fleeing her lungs.</p><p align="justify">“What?” Agatha asked, stunned. The arts school was the gateway to the fashion college in Paris.</p><p align="justify">Edward did not blink.</p><p align="justify">“I want the car keys, and we’re canceling your pre-enrollment in Paris.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart dropped.</p><p align="justify">“Dad! Please!”</p><p align="justify">“No! You crossed every limit. I want the keys now!”</p><p align="justify">There was a second of absolute silence. The kind of silence that hurts the ears. Agatha took a deep breath, closed her eyes for a moment, as if still trying to wake up from that nightmare. Then she reached into her bag, pulled out the keychain—the pink pom-pom swaying in a ridiculously fragile way—and held it out to her father.</p><p align="justify">Edward snatched the key from her hand and closed his fist tightly around it, his knuckles turning white. Agatha sighed, defeated, her shoulders slumping.</p><p align="justify">“But Dad… you can’t leave me without studying, I… I’ll lose the year… and—”</p><p align="justify">“But who said you’re going to be without studying?”</p><p align="justify">She frowned, confused.</p><p align="justify">“H-how so?” Agatha stammered.</p><p align="justify">Edward reached into his shirt pocket with a sharp gesture. Without drama, without ceremony, he pulled out a folded pamphlet and opened it in front of her. On the cover, a huge castle of gray stone, surrounded by dense trees. At the top, in rigid letters: </p><p align="justify">Ravenswood Boarding School.  Boarding school.</p><p align="justify">“You… you can’t be serious… Dad.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s for your own good. It’s an excellent school. It will help you with many things.” The blood rushed to Agatha’s head.</p><p align="justify">“I CAN’T GO TO THAT PLACE! IT’S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE! I can’t study with those hillbillies!”</p><p align="justify">Edward remained firm.</p><p align="justify">“You should have thought of that before doing the stupidity you did.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha jumped to her feet.</p><p align="justify">“It’s always like this, isn’t it? You always send me away when you can’t solve the problem! Camp, Grandma’s house—always like this!”</p><p align="justify">“Agatha, these are consequences of your actions!” She laughed without humor, eyes shining with anger and pain.</p><p align="justify">“Of course you’d choose your perfect wife. That’s obvious. Did you know she took down all of Mom’s paintings?”</p><p align="justify">Edward took a deep breath before answering.</p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t her. It was me.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha froze.</p><p align="justify">“Why?”</p><p align="justify">“Agatha, your mother died twelve years ago, and for twelve years she has been the ghost of our lives. I need to move on—and you do too!” The words came like a slap.</p><p align="justify">“This wouldn’t have happened if—”</p><p align="justify">“If what?” Edward asked. Agatha couldn’t hold it anymore.</p><p align="justify">“If you hadn’t been driving drunk! SHE WOULDN’T BE A GHOST, SHE’D BE ALIVE!”</p><p align="justify">Edward blinked once. Just once. As if the sentence had passed through his flesh and struck something much deeper.</p><p align="justify">“So that’s what you think happened?”</p><p align="justify">“You told me!”</p><p align="justify">“No. I told you it was reckless driving, but I never said who was driving.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood still, staring at her father, her brain trying to keep up. </p><p align="justify">“That’s a lie. You just want to hurt me.”</p><p align="justify">Edward turned on his heel and left the room. The sound of his footsteps echoed down the hallway. A few seconds later, he returned holding an old newspaper, yellowed with time. He held it out to her. Agatha took it. Read it. Reread it. And then she saw it.</p><p align="justify">“The one in the driver’s seat was Liliana.”</p><p align="justify">The world seemed to tilt.</p><p align="justify">Agatha sat on the bed, her hands trembling, the newspaper slipping from her fingers.</p><p align="justify">“Your mother, Agatha, was not the perfection you remember. I loved her, but she was an intense woman, with many problems! Especially alcohol! I never told you this because I wanted to preserve the memory you had of your mother!”</p><p align="justify">The tears finally fell.</p><p align="justify">“I want to be alone! Get out!”</p><p align="justify">“Fine. Enjoy your alone time packing your bags. You’re going to this boarding school tomorrow, and you will finish your school year there! Pack your things now!”</p><p align="justify">Edward closed the door firmly. Agatha remained seated, motionless, feeling as if someone had torn pieces from her childhood, from her mother, from everything that sustained her. The memories no longer fit together. They no longer formed a whole.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">Morning in Los Angeles dawned rainy. The gray sky made the mansion even more silent, as if the entire city had decided to respect Agatha’s private mourning. Under the covers, she scrolled through her phone screen unhurriedly, swollen eyes reading messages from the group of friends. Hearts, crying emojis, exaggerated promises of visits, and words of encouragement that sounded far too empty for what she felt.</p><p align="justify">Agatha even opened Twitter and, with a few quick taps, posted about how she was being a victim of repression by an authoritarian father. Alphas, always thinking they could control the lives of omega children, deciding destinies as if they were business contracts. The tweet got likes almost instantly. It gave her a brief, shallow, but necessary satisfaction.</p><p align="justify">When she realized she couldn’t hide there forever, she took a deep breath and got up against her own will.</p><p align="justify">She walked to the bathroom of the suite, the cold marble under her bare feet, and turned on the bathtub faucet. She sat on the edge, watching the water slowly rise, steam filling the room. She undressed carelessly, dropping each piece on the floor as if she no longer felt attached to anything from the night before.</p><p align="justify">She stepped into the tub and sank her body, letting the hot water wrap around her shoulders, her neck, her chin.</p><p align="justify">She closed her eyes for a few seconds. She didn’t cry. Not there. Agatha didn’t cry when she needed to arm herself.</p><p align="justify">After the bath, she wrapped herself in a white towel and returned to the bedroom. The closet looked like a private museum, racks perfectly organized, shoes aligned by color, bags displayed like works of art. She paused in front of the clothes for a moment, her gaze assessing everything coldly.</p><p align="justify">If she was leaving, she would not leave small.</p><p align="justify">Agatha chose a short Miu Miu skirt, low-waisted, structured, in a light tone that contrasted with the gray day. She put on a fitted, minimalist top, leaving her cleavage exposed at the exact point between calculated innocence and provocation. On her feet, classic Chanel flats, black, impeccable.</p><p align="justify">She took a thin, almost transparent pair of stockings and adjusted them carefully. The mirror reflected the image of a rich, spoiled girl, perfectly aware of her own privilege. And she liked what she saw.</p><p align="justify">She sat at the vanity and applied a rosy gloss to her lips, light blush on her cheekbones, just enough mascara to highlight her eyes without looking like effort. Her blonde hair stayed loose, softly wavy, as if she had woken up that way—a lie rehearsed to perfection.</p><p align="justify">Agatha sprayed an expensive perfume on her neck and wrists, grabbed a small leather bag, and put inside her phone, her headphones, the credit card that hadn’t yet been confiscated. She looked around the room one last time. The walls, the furniture, the details that had always been part of the scenery of her perfect life.</p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath before leaving the room. One of those long, controlled, rehearsed breaths—not of someone seeking calm, but of someone arming themselves. She straightened her shoulders, adjusted the bag on her forearm, and walked to the door as if she were about to step onto a stage she already knew well. When she opened it, the hallway seemed narrower than ever, too silent for that farewell no one dared to name.</p><p align="justify">She went down the stairs slowly, the sound of her steps echoing through the house—too big, too luxurious, too empty. The smell of fresh coffee came from the dining room, mixed with something sweet that would normally comfort her. Today, it didn’t. When she reached the last step, she saw them: her father seated at the table, impeccable as always, and Val across from him, distractedly flipping through something while drinking coffee.</p><p align="justify">“Good morning, Agatha,” Val said, in the same calm voice as always, as if the night before had been just an irrelevant detail, as if suitcases hadn’t floated in the pool, as if nothing had been broken.</p><p align="justify">The irritation rose hot, almost physical. I threw her clothes into the pool, Agatha thought, feeling her fingers curl slightly at her side. How can she act like she doesn’t care? That was when it hit her, slow and cruel. Val didn’t need to react. Val didn’t need to raise her voice. She had won. And she knew it. Her silence wasn’t forgiveness—it was victory.</p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled out the chair and sat without answering. She crossed her legs with automatic elegance, put on oversized white-framed sunglasses—far too big for an indoor space, far too ostentatious to be ignored—and reached for the glass of juice in front of her. She took a long sip in silence, lips firm, face completely neutral.</p><p align="justify">Edward stood up, as he did every morning, leaning in to kiss his daughter’s head in a gesture that had always been routine, almost sacred. Agatha leaned back an inch. It wasn’t abrupt. It wasn’t theatrical. It was precise. Enough to break the gesture in midair.</p><p align="justify">Her father hesitated for a second, unsettled, and sat back down.</p><p align="justify">“Did you sleep well?” he tried, his voice low, overly careful.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t answer. She simply set the glass back on the table, her well-manicured nails touching the glass with a dry sound. Edward tried another comment—something about traffic, about the flight time, about how the rain had worsened that morning. Nothing. No response. Not even a nod.</p><p align="justify">She ignored him throughout the house, crossing the hallways as if she were alone, without looking back, without acknowledging the presence of either of them. She ignored him in the car, staring out the window with her headphones on, even without music playing. She ignored him at the airport, sitting with a perfect posture, the phone in her hands, the sunglasses still on her face, creating an invisible, impenetrable barrier.</p><p align="justify">Edward tried to speak again during boarding. A comment about England, about the weather, about how Ravenswood had a good reputation. Agatha did not react. Her silence was absolute, sharp, definitive. </p><p align="justify">And it continued that way on the plane, throughout the entire flight, while the sky changed color and the world was left behind. When they finally landed in England, Agatha did not look at her father. She did not remove her sunglasses. She did not say a word.</p><p align="justify">The car moved slowly along the long dirt road, the tires lifting small clouds of damp dust as tall, dark trees closed in around the path like a corridor too narrow for escape. The silence inside the vehicle was thick, heavy, broken only by the low hum of the engine and the occasional creak of the suspension. It was Edward who gave in first.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not going to talk to me?” he said, when the iron gate was already behind them and the road seemed endless.</p><p align="justify">Agatha kept her gaze fixed out the window for a few seconds before responding, her jaw rigid, her entire body tense beneath clothes far too impeccable for that place.</p><p align="justify"> “Oh, now you want to talk now?” she said, without turning her face. “After bringing me to a convent?”</p><p align="justify">Edward let out a tired sigh, running a hand over his face.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not a convent, it’s a very expensive school, by the way.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged, a small, disinterested gesture, almost cruel in its indifference. The car finally stopped. The driver got out first, walked around the vehicle, and opened the front door. Then he opened the back door.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped out with calculated calm. She adjusted the bag on her shoulder, lifted her sunglasses slightly, and cast a slow, assessing, deeply critical look at everything in front of her. Everything was different from Los Angeles. There was no golden light, no vivid colors, no shine. Everything was gray—the sky, the stone of the building, the ground; even the air seemed heavy. The uniforms crossing the courtyard looked like they had seen better days, stiff fabrics, outdated cuts, as if they had been taken straight from her grandmother’s closet.</p><p align="justify">Edward approached, stopping beside his daughter, watching her in silence for a moment.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not even going to give me a hug?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, long and resigned, as if that gesture cost her more than she wanted to admit. She took a step forward and hugged him. It wasn’t cold, but it wasn’t long either. A farewell hug, not one of reconciliation.</p><p align="justify">“Please, Dad…” she said, in a last attempt, her voice lower, almost imperceptible.</p><p align="justify">Edward kissed his daughter’s forehead carefully, the way he used to when she was little, as if that gesture still had the power to protect her.</p><p align="justify">“It’s the best thing for you.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha scoffed, stepping away.</p><p align="justify">“I love you,” Edward said firmly. She crossed her arms, chin raised, expression closed.</p><p align="justify"> “I hope your flight takes foreveeeer, so long that you have to sleep in those horrible airport hotels.”</p><p align="justify">Edward laughed, a short laugh, a mix of exhaustion and affection, and kissed his daughter’s cheek before stepping away. He walked back to the car without looking back.</p><p align="justify">Agatha remained standing. She took a deep breath. Then she lifted the sunglasses onto her head, freeing her eyes for the first time since she had arrived. She observed the imposing building in front of her, the austere courtyard, the unfamiliar people, the gray world that now swallowed her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha dragged her suitcase along the stone path with a mix of irritation and contempt, the wheel catching from time to time in the uneven cracks, when she was forced to stop. </p><p align="justify">Three girls appeared in front of her as if they had been waiting for that moment. The one in the center had brown hair neatly tied back, a pretty, controlled smile—one that didn’t fully reach her eyes.</p><p align="justify">The uniform—which Agatha thought was horrible—was impeccable on her, not a crease out of place, and an armband fitted to her arm revealed some kind of authority. To her right, a red-haired girl observed everything with poorly disguised curiosity, wearing the ugliest socks Agatha had ever seen in her life, thick and mismatched. To the left, an Asian girl adjusted the oversized glasses on her face, analyzing Agatha as if she were facing an interesting experiment.</p><p align="justify">“Welcome to Ravenswood,” said the girl in the center, extending her hand with rehearsed ease.</p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at the outstretched hand without moving a single muscle of her body. Before she could respond—or simply ignore it—the girl grabbed her hand without asking permission, linking their fingers in a grip far too firm for a cordial gesture.</p><p align="justify">“Hey, who do you think you are, the Pope?” Agatha reacted immediately, pulling her arm back slightly.</p><p align="justify">The girl in the center kept smiling, but the strong accent slipped out along with the reply.</p><p align="justify">“It’s tradition. You must greet the president of the omega student council.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha let go of her hand with disdain and placed her own on her hip, tilting her head slightly, her gaze sharp.</p><p align="justify">“I like to greet people I’m interested in.”</p><p align="justify">The redhead and the girl with glasses covered their mouths at the same time, stifling nervous giggles, as if they had never seen anyone confront that strange and apparently untouchable figure like that. </p><p align="justify">The smile of the girl in the center faltered for a second. She clenched her fist, visibly about to retort, her rigid posture revealing she wasn’t used to being challenged.</p><p align="justify">“Melina, how nice… you’ve already met our new student.”</p><p align="justify">The voice came from behind, firm and serene, cutting the tension in the air like a clean blade. The girl in the center relaxed her body immediately.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, Principal Lorna… but it looks like someone’s a little cranky,” Melina replied with a crooked half-smile.</p><p align="justify">“Girls, let’s calm down,” Lorna asked, approaching with controlled steps. Her gaze settled on Agatha with calculated interest. </p><p align="justify">“Miss Harkness, it’s good to have you here with us.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged, not hiding her boredom.</p><p align="justify"> “Whatever.” For a moment, the silence seemed to weigh more than before. Lorna did not falter.</p><p align="justify">“Please follow me,” she said, turning toward the main building.</p><p align="justify">Before leaving, Lorna cast a quick look at the trio.</p><p align="justify"> “Alice, Jen, take Agatha’s bags to her room.”</p><p align="justify">The two obeyed without question, each pulling part of the luggage. Agatha had no choice but to release the handle of her own suitcase and follow behind the principal, feeling the gray castle slowly close in around her, as if Ravenswood were, at that very moment, deciding what to do with her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha crossed the main door with firm steps, the sound of her heels echoing through the vast interior of the building. </p><p align="justify">Inside, Ravenswood looked like it had come from another time: dark wood everywhere, long corridors adorned with old portraits in golden frames, yellowed photos of impeccably aligned classes, gleaming trophies arranged in heavy glass display cases. There were crests carved into the walls, plaques with names in Latin, antique clocks marking time with an almost solemn tick-tock. Everything smelled of tradition, of discipline, of something that had not been made for her.</p><p align="justify">The two walked in silence to the principal’s office. The space was wide and austere, with a solid wooden desk occupying the center, symmetrical armchairs in front of it, and tall shelves covering one of the walls. Lorna indicated the chair with a restrained gesture.</p><p align="justify">“You may sit.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha did so against her own will, throwing her body back, crossing her legs impatiently, as if that simple act were an enormous concession. Lorna settled behind the desk and opened a folder, flipping through a few documents with calculated calm.</p><p align="justify">She began to talk about the school, the history of Ravenswood, the values, the discipline, the academic performance. She commented that Agatha’s grades at her former school were excellent, above average, and that she sincerely believed Agatha would have no difficulty keeping up with the class. She spoke calmly, as if describing something inevitable.</p><p align="justify">Then she softened her tone. She said that Ravenswood was a family. That there Agatha would find hers. That she would have space to grow, learn, structure herself, understand who she was away from the noise and distractions. That the place could offer everything she needed.</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a short, humorless laugh.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t want to kill your vibe right now when you’re trying so hard to be adorable, but this is a mistake.”</p><p align="justify">Lorna raised an eyebrow, interested.</p><p align="justify">“And why would it be?” Agatha stood up immediately, unable to remain seated.</p><p align="justify">“I shouldn’t be here. Seriously, look at me. Do you really think I fit into this place?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, and why do you think that?” Lorna asked, without losing her calm.</p><p align="justify">Agatha began to walk around the room, gesturing, each word loaded with irritation.</p><p align="justify">“First: this place looks like it stopped in the last century. Second: what are these clothes?” she said, vaguely pointing to her imaginary uniform. “And third… I’m required to shake hands with someone I don’t even know out of respect? What is this, a dictatorship?”</p><p align="justify">Lorna listened to everything in silence, without interrupting, without reacting immediately. When Agatha finished, breathing deeply, the principal stood up and walked to the bookshelf.</p><p align="justify">“All right. Everything can be arranged,” she said serenely, running her fingers along the spines of the books. “I see that you’re not a bad girl. You’re just confused.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, tired.</p><p align="justify">“All my psychiatrists and psychologists said that,” she muttered. “But I think you just prefer not to understand.”</p><p align="justify">Lorna pulled a thick book from the shelf and returned to her, holding it out.</p><p align="justify">“What is this?” Agatha asked, suspicious.</p><p align="justify">Lorna smiled, a small, almost complicit smile.</p><p align="justify">“Something to help you understand where you are.” Agatha scoffed.</p><p align="justify">“Great. More riddles.” When she turned toward the door, she found the same red-haired girl from the entrance standing there, impeccable posture, open expression.</p><p align="justify">“Wanda,” said Lorna, “punctual as always.”</p><p align="justify">The girl smiled.</p><p align="justify">“Well,” Lorna continued, “Wanda, take Agatha to your room so she can settle in.”</p><p align="justify">“This way!” Wanda said cheerfully, already turning to head down the corridor.</p><p align="justify">Agatha passed by her like a bad-tempered hurricane, without thanking her, without responding, moving down the hallway as if each step were a silent form of protest against all of it.</p><p align="justify"><br/><br/></p>

Wanda walked beside her, talking nonstop about schedules, rules, forbidden wings, study halls, quiet hours, the bell that rang far too early, all with an enthusiasm that was almost offensive to someone who had just been ripped out of her own life.</p><p align="justify">“You know, I can handle myself,” Agatha said, interrupting, without even looking at her.</p><p align="justify">“You don’t need to act like Hagrid guiding Harry Potter.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m just trying to be helpful,” Wanda replied, with a smile far too patient for the situation.</p><p align="justify">“You’d be more helpful if you left me alone.”</p><p align="justify">Wanda opened her mouth to answer, but Agatha had already pushed open the bedroom door. The room was… worse than she imagined. Four beds took up almost all the space, arranged symmetrically and impersonally. Identical sheets, heavy curtains, metal lockers with no charm whatsoever.<br/>
There was a tall window letting in a gray, lifeless light, and the smell of the place was a mix of old cleaning products with something vaguely damp. It wasn’t a bedroom. It was a dormitory.</p><p align="justify">Two girls were already there. One of them Agatha recognized immediately: Alice, the girl who had helped with the bags outside. The other was unfamiliar, sitting on the bed fiddling with a thick notebook, glasses slipping slightly down her nose.</p><p align="justify">“Well,” Wanda said, pointing, “you know Alice. And this is Jen.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha frowned slightly, inhaling almost without noticing.</p><p align="justify">“Aren’t you omegas?” she asked, genuinely confused at not picking up any scent that would indicate that.</p><p align="justify">“We’re betas,” Alice replied calmly. “It’s much more peaceful.”</p><p align="justify">“I doubt it,” Agatha muttered, dropping her outrageously expensive Chanel bag onto the bed as if it were just any backpack.</p><p align="justify">The three of them stared at the bag for a second longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify">“Well,” Agatha continued, already sitting down, “thanks for the welcome. Now can you leave?”</p><p align="justify">There was a brief silence. Then the three of them exchanged looks… and burst out laughing.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry,” Agatha said irritably, “did I miss some joke?”</p><p align="justify">“Silly,” Alice replied, still laughing.</p><p align="justify">“We’re all sleeping here.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed two fingers to the bridge of her nose, squeezing hard.</p><p align="justify">“I deserve this.”</p><p align="justify">The sentence came out like a defeated sigh, almost a personal mantra. Agatha ran a hand over her face, her fingers sliding slowly as if she were trying to wake up from a particularly badly decorated nightmare.</p><p align="justify">“Well, you can either take bed number four over there,” Jen said, pointing to the farthest bed, “or go sleep in the hallway. Your choice, dear.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes so hard she almost saw her own brain. Without answering, she pulled her phone out of her bag with an automatic, theatrical gesture, as if that object were her last anchor to the civilized world. She walked to the corner bed and sat down, the mattress far too thin sinking under the weight of her body and, above all, her indignation.</p><p align="justify">“What the hell…” she muttered, staring at the lit screen. “There’s no signal?”</p><p align="justify">Wanda clasped her hands behind her back, chin slightly raised, almost proud of that information.</p><p align="justify">“What is that thing?” Alice asked, tilting her head, genuinely curious.</p><p align="justify">“It’s an iPhone, the latest generation,” Jen explained, as if narrating a documentary.</p><p align="justify">“There’s no signal… you’ll be lucky if you get even a drop of signal here,” Wanda added. “And phones are only allowed on weekends.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha then stared at an old black button phone resting on a side table, like a relic forgotten in time. Lifting her face was a slow movement, heavy with judgment.</p><p align="justify">“What? Where the hell are we? Russia? And how about you try entering the 21st century, hillbilly?”</p><p align="justify">“Calm down,” Wanda said, maintaining an irritating patience. “It’s not the end of the world.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not the end of the world for you, redhead. This place is medieval,” Agatha shot back, already getting up and starting to pace the room in circles like a caged animal.</p><p align="justify">“I need to make calls. I have a basketball star girlfriend on the other side of the planet walking around out there.”</p><p align="justify">“As I said,” Wanda replied, “phones only on weekends.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped abruptly.</p><p align="justify"> “And how am I supposed to call my therapist?”</p><p align="justify">“You can talk to Principal Lorna. And your girlfriend… if she loves you, she’ll wait,” Wanda answered, with the greatest naturalness in the world.</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged theatrically.</p><p align="justify">“You virgins are funny.”</p><p align="justify"> “Sweetheart, deal with it. This isn’t Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It’s a school,” Jen said bluntly. “And have you ever slept with an alpha?”</p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied, sitting back down on the bed as if she were talking about the weather. “You’re in this end of the world and don’t even know what you’re missing.”</p><p align="justify">“Put that phone away before the inspector catches you,” Wanda warned.</p><p align="justify">She then looked around the room, frowning.</p><p align="justify">“Hey… where’s the rest of your luggage?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, they haven’t brought it yet.”</p><p align="justify">The girls looked at each other in silence. Agatha almost asked something, but then it hit her—heavy, cruel—at the exact same moment a thunderclap echoed outside, announcing the storm that was beginning to fall.</p><p align="justify">A few minutes later, Jen and Alice came in carrying Agatha’s suitcase and set it on the floor. Agatha immediately knelt down, unzipped it in a hurry… and felt a wave of nervous nausea rise. All her clothes were ruined. Soaked. Wrinkled. Destroyed.</p><p align="justify">“No, no! My Gucci shoes!” she screamed. “They’re a new release! My clothes!”</p><p align="justify">Wanda watched with a clear expression of pity as despair spread across Agatha’s face.</p><p align="justify">“My clothes are hand-washed! No… I don’t believe this!”</p><p align="justify">Wanda rummaged through the suitcase and found some outrageously expensive bottles of water.</p><p align="justify">“What for…?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, what if I get thirsty?”</p><p align="justify">“Look, in England we have this incredible invention called a tap,” Wanda mocked.</p><p align="justify">Before Agatha could have another meltdown, the door suddenly opened. An older woman entered carrying a plastic box, blonde hair pulled back rigidly, impeccable posture, completely neutral expression.</p><p align="justify">“Welcome, girls.”</p><p align="justify">“Finally the help has arrived!” Agatha said, gesturing toward the suitcase. “How long does it take you to clean this up?”</p><p align="justify">The woman slowly raised her head.</p><p align="justify"> “She is…”</p><p align="justify">“American,” Jen finished.</p><p align="justify">“Hm. We had one of those in ’96… not a good one,” Inspector Sue commented.</p><p align="justify">She analyzed Agatha from head to toe.</p><p align="justify">“Inform her of my rules. She should be in uniform, to begin with.”</p><p align="justify">“Phones, please,” Sue said, shaking the box.</p><p align="justify">Everyone placed their phones inside. Sue walked over to Agatha’s bed and picked up both of her devices.</p><p align="justify">“Hey! Leave that there!”</p><p align="justify">“Hm?” Sue raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">“I said drop it! Leave that there! Hablas español? Parli italiano?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m Scottish. And not an idiot.” Agatha dropped the wet clothes onto Sue’s hands.</p><p align="justify">“Wash, dry in order, and no creases when ironing.”</p><p align="justify">Sue looked outraged.</p><p align="justify">“You insolent girl. No casual clothing for a week!”</p><p align="justify">“Casual clothing might be your thing, sweetheart, but it’s not mine!”</p><p align="justify">“You’ll have to wear the uniform for a week,” Jen explained.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t give a fuck. I’ll be gone by then anyway.”</p><p align="justify">“Swearing! Two weeks of detention for the entire room!” Sue decreed. The trio groaned in unison.</p><p align="justify">“Calm down, calm down, I’ll fix this,” Agatha said, pulling a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and handing it to the inspector. “Here. You could take a little walk, buy something. What’s little for you is everything, leech.”</p><p align="justify">Sue sighed and looked at all of them.</p><p align="justify">“Three Sundays. For all of you.”</p><p align="justify">The murmur of displeasure was immediate. Sue left the room carrying the phones.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you very much, idiot!” Alice complained, throwing herself onto the bed.</p><p align="justify">“Do you have some kind of mental problem?” Jen asked.</p><p align="justify">“That woman is a pain in the ass,” Agatha said, flopping onto the mattress. “She needs someone to fuck her, you know?”</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was heavy.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood in the middle of the room for far too long, as if her body refused to accept that reality all at once. Her eyes slowly swept over the beds aligned with military precision, the dark wood that creaked even when no one moved, the old walls that seemed to have absorbed too many years of other people’s stories.<br/>
The ceiling was too low, too oppressive, as if it were deliberately trying to remind her that she didn’t belong there. For the first time since arriving at Ravenswood, something very close to panic settled in her chest—not a dramatic attack, but a suffocating, silent sensation that everything was out of control.</p><p align="justify">Jen returned to the room carrying a uniform inside a protective bag, holding it carefully as if it were something precious.</p><p align="justify">“Here, I think this is your size.”</p><p align="justify">“Put it on now before the bell rings.”</p><p align="justify">The bell rang and the group screamed.</p><p align="justify"> “NOW!”</p><p align="justify">Agatha grabbed the uniform irritably, without thanking anyone, and began stripping right there, without any modesty at all, as if that were the only way to maintain some kind of control over the situation. The blazer came off first, then the skirt, then the blouse, until she was standing in the middle of the room in just bra and panties, completely indifferent to the stares.</p><p align="justify">“Oh my God! That’s awesome.”</p><p align="justify">“What?” Agatha asked impatiently, not even turning around.</p><p align="justify">“Your bunny tattoo is amazing,” Wanda said, pointing. Agatha had a small bunny tattooed on the curve of her butt—discreet, delicate, and provocative at the same time.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, yes,” she replied with absolute naturalness. “That’s my old bunny. Ebony. She passed away, so I got a tribute. And it’s also sexy.”</p><p align="justify">She finished putting on the uniform with extreme distaste, adjusting each piece as if it were a personal affront. Before leaving, she pulled the skirt a few centimeters higher than allowed, tucked the blazer inside it completely against the rules, then kicked away the horrible school-issued shoes as if they were trash, replacing them with her beautiful Chanel flats.</p><p align="justify">The trio stared at Agatha as if they had just witnessed a forbidden magic show.</p><p align="justify">In the end, Agatha simply put a bow in her hair, satisfied.</p><p align="justify">“We’re screwed when Melina sees this…” Jen said, crossing her arms.</p><p align="justify">“Why?” Agatha asked. “Are you all that afraid of this Melina? Is she some kind of dog that bites?”</p><p align="justify">Laughter filled the room unexpectedly, loud and nervous. Agatha almost liked it.</p><p align="justify">“She’s the Student Council president,” Alice explained. “She can kind of ruin our lives.” Wanda then took a pin from the box and handed it to Agatha. The Omega symbol gleamed in gold.</p><p align="justify">“For Buddha’s sake, we really did go back to the medieval era,” Agatha said, putting on the pin.</p><p align="justify">Wanda had an identical one. Jen and Alice wore the beta symbol. The pins were similar, differing only in shape, as if that small distinction were enough to justify an entire social hierarchy.</p><p align="justify">The trio left the room chatting animatedly. Agatha followed behind with a sour expression, hating every minute. They talked about riding lessons and something called “lacrosse,” which Agatha decided, without any effort at all, was just another hillbilly game disguised as tradition.</p><p align="justify">The group went down the creaking wooden stairs, and Agatha could swear she was in a low-budget version of Hogwarts. Everything looked too old, too serious, with no glamour at all. They all entered the dining hall, which was already full. Long wooden tables filled the space, the high ceiling had Gothic architecture, narrow windows let in a cold, gray light. </p><p align="justify">Everything seemed more, that no longer felt like a school. The sensation was of being trapped inside a nightmare designed by someone who hated happy teenagers. The long, cold corridors of ancient stone seemed to repeat endlessly, and the sound of footsteps echoed too loudly, as if the building itself were watching every movement. Wanda walked beside Agatha with a disconcerting naturalness, going over the rules as if reciting something she had learned long ago, while Agatha walked with her arms crossed, her brow furrowed and her patience in shreds.</p><p align="justify">“First,” Wanda began, glancing sideways at Agatha’s uniform, “I seriously doubt you can wear the uniform like that. And, as you say, ‘not happening’: cigarettes are forbidden, alcohol too, no fireworks, no weapons of any kind, and no drugs of any kind.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted loudly, crossing her arms even tighter, as if that were physically possible.</p><p align="justify">“If you have a problem with someone, don’t whine,” Wanda continued, unbothered. “Structure your argument. No internet, no intimidation.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha walked beside her, listening with calculated disdain, her eyes wandering around as if searching for an emergency exit.</p><p align="justify">“And one more thing,” Wanda added, now more serious, “if you behave like an idiot, everyone will suffer. So if you drag us into your mess… we break you.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, a mocking half-smile forming on her lips.</p><p align="justify">“Oooh, scary.”</p><p align="justify">As the group entered one of the great halls, Agatha noticed something curious: practically everyone they passed greeted Wanda. Nods, smiles, quick comments. Wanda answered everyone with ease, as if it were part of her daily routine.</p><p align="justify">“What is it,” Agatha muttered, “is Wanda the queen of the place?”</p><p align="justify">Jen smiled to the side.</p><p align="justify">“Wanda has a terrible problem,” she said, almost amused. “Lucky for you, you won’t have it. It’s called popularity.”</p><p align="justify">“Hm,” Agatha replied, shrugging before sitting down on one of the long benches.</p><p align="justify">“Stand up,” Wanda said quickly. “Wait for Mrs. Wu and the council presidents.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t give a damn,” Agatha replied, resting her chin on her hand, completely slouched.</p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice exchanged looks, clearly out of patience. Without saying a word, the two grabbed Agatha by the arm and pulled her to her feet.</p><p align="justify">“This is physical assault!” Agatha protested. “I’m calling my lawyer!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh yeah?” Wanda asked, smiling mockingly. “From where?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted, defeated by her own argument. Jen then smiled, looking ahead.</p><p align="justify">“Hello, Rio. How kind of you… to grace us with your beautiful presence.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes automatically shifted to the figure approaching, while Alice and Wanda let out low giggles, clearly enjoying the situation.</p><p align="justify">Wanda checked the watch on her wrist.</p><p align="justify">“Melina will walk in in three… two… one.”</p><p align="justify">“Hi!” Melina greeted Rio cheerfully, lightly touching her arm.</p><p align="justify">“‘Establishing contact,’” Alice murmured, making Wanda and Jen laugh even harder.</p><p align="justify">At that moment, Principal Lorna entered the hall and rang a small metallic bell, the sound spreading quickly and imposing silence. Everyone sat down. Agatha leaned forward, curious despite herself.</p><p align="justify">“Who’s that Rio?”</p><p align="justify">“The principal’s niece,” Jen replied conspiratorially. “Alice’s cousin. Alpha and heartbreaker.”</p><p align="justify">“She doesn’t look at any of us after she got caught playing doctor with a seventh-grade girl when she was fourteen,” Wanda added.</p><p align="justify">“It was pandemonium,” Alice said, “but they’re not together anymore.”</p><p align="justify">“Because of her ‘pandemonium,’” Jen finished.</p><p align="justify">The three burst out laughing.</p><p align="justify">“No… dating is forbidden!” Alice said, still laughing.</p><p align="justify">Lunch began to be served. Trays passed from hand to hand. When the plate was placed in front of her, Agatha froze, staring at the contents as if it were potentially poisonous.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t eat this,” she said, lightly pushing the plate away.</p><p align="justify">Jen tilted her head.</p><p align="justify">“Anorexia or bulimia?” she asked with clinical curiosity. “Because if it’s bulimia, it’s better not to eat cake at anyone’s birthday. That would be such a waste.”</p><p align="justify">“Actually,” Agatha replied, offended, “I only eat fish from Monday to Wednesday, fruit from Thursday to Friday, and vegetables always.”</p><p align="justify">Before anyone could respond, a bell was rung. Everyone immediately bowed their heads to pray.</p><p align="justify">Agatha, confused for a second, did the same—but clearly in her own way.</p><p align="justify">“Nam-myoho-renge-kyo… Namastê.”</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was absolute. Slowly, everyone around looked at her. Agatha lifted her face, completely serious.</p><p align="justify">“What?” she asked. “Spirituality is universal.”</p><p align="justify">Rio was watching and let out a low chuckle.</p><p align="justify">After lunch, Agatha walked toward the classroom beside Wanda, their footsteps echoing through the long, cold corridor as if timed by some invisible mechanism of the place. The high ceiling, stone walls, and narrow windows made everything more claustrophobic, and Agatha felt as if every movement of hers was being watched. Suddenly, she stopped. It was a reflex. She lifted her chin slightly, already prepared for confrontation before even understanding why.</p><p align="justify">Melina was in front of her.</p><p align="justify">Without saying absolutely anything, Melina walked past, shoving Agatha with her shoulder, hard enough to push her a step to the side, as if she were nothing more than an inconvenient obstacle.</p><p align="justify">“Hey, watch the leather, buddy,” Agatha shot back immediately, turning around. “Two hundred goats died for it.”</p><p align="justify">Melina stopped, turned slowly, a venomous smile forming on her lips.</p><p align="justify">“We meet again. How wonderful.”</p><p align="justify">She stepped closer, invading Agatha’s personal space, her gaze evaluative, superior.</p><p align="justify">“Learn the rules. In right of way, there is a hierarchy: teachers, student council presidents, students… dogs, worms, and, of course, Americans.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but Melina had already shifted her gaze to Wanda.</p><p align="justify">“Wanda, put her in line.”</p><p align="justify">And then she walked away, as if she had just given a perfectly reasonable order.</p><p align="justify">“What is this place, Auschwitz?” Agatha snapped, still standing in the middle of the corridor.</p><p align="justify">Melina suddenly turned back, as if she had heard exactly what she wanted.</p><p align="justify">“You can’t wear the uniform like that. Go to detention,” she said, already opening her notebook with mechanical speed.</p><p align="justify">“Go fuck yourself and leave me alone.”</p><p align="justify">Melina narrowed her eyes, her jaw tightening.</p><p align="justify">“What did you say? You’re a spoiled rich girl with no respect for authority. I hope you enjoy your days in detention.”</p><p align="justify">“I only respect whoever I choose,” Agatha replied, not lowering her voice. “I don’t know you. Why should I respect you?”</p><p align="justify">Melina’s fists clenched tightly.</p><p align="justify">“Because those are the rules! Insolent American.”</p><p align="justify">She tore a slip of paper from the notebook and threw it against Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify">“Great,” Agatha said, picking it up without even looking. “At least some peace in this place. And if I don’t have to look at your horse face, even better.”</p><p align="justify">Wanda immediately lowered her head, shoulders shaking as she tried to hold back laughter. Melina had already clicked her pen, ready to add another week of punishment, when a young blonde approached. Short hair framed a calm face; her uniform was similar to Agatha’s except for the trousers, and the pin on her chest bore an “A,” alpha.</p><p align="justify">Agatha swept the room with her gaze and noticed, with immediate irritation, the presence—and the scent—of several alphas scattered around.</p><p align="justify">“What’s going on here?” Natasha, president of the Alpha Council, asked firmly.</p><p align="justify">“Our joint breakfast would be great if it weren’t for her,” Melina said, pointing at Agatha without ceremony. “She’s been causing trouble since she arrived.”</p><p align="justify">Natasha looked at Agatha, who rolled her eyes, arms crossed, completely out of patience.</p><p align="justify">“It’s her first day, Melina. Leave her alone,” another voice said.</p><p align="justify">An alpha approached with her hands in her pockets, attentive brown eyes, short hair, and a posture far too relaxed for such a rigid environment.</p><p align="justify">“But, Rio! She’s breaking the rules and—”</p><p align="justify">“Relax,” the young woman said gently, placing her hands on Melina’s shoulders. “It’s just breakfast.”</p><p align="justify">Melina took a deep breath, gathered her things with abrupt movements, and left. Silence fell heavily over the table, uncomfortable, full of curious glances.</p><p align="justify">“Are you okay? I know changes can be hard and—”</p><p align="justify">“Look,” Agatha interrupted, “I don’t know who you are, but I definitely didn’t need your help. I already had everything handled.”</p><p align="justify">“But—”</p><p align="justify">“I know how to handle my own problems,” Agatha continued, her voice sharp. “I don’t need any meddling alpha in them, especially ones I don’t know.”</p><p align="justify">Wanda was paler than ever. Jen looked absolutely shocked. Alice had the expression of someone seconds away from cardiac arrest.</p><p align="justify">“Alright,” the young alpha said calmly. “I apologize. By the way, my name is Rio and—”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t care. Just leave me alone.”</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded slowly and walked away without arguing.</p><p align="justify">“Have you lost your mind?” Wanda whispered, panicked.</p><p align="justify">“Just because she’s alpha she thinks she can stick her nose where she’s not called?” Agatha shot back. “She should mind her own business. I didn’t ask for any help!”</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood up abruptly and stormed out of the dining hall, steps fast, heart racing with anger.</p><p align="justify">She marched to the principal’s office, knocked hard on the door, and seconds later heard a “come in.” She opened it and stared at Lorna, who was sitting behind the desk finishing an email.</p><p align="justify">“I need to call home. I’m having a heart attack! I’m going to die. This place is going to kill me!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, what happened?” Lorna asked, lifting her gaze with excessive calm.</p><p align="justify">“Everyone here is intrusive! It smells awful and everyone hates me. Can I go home?”</p><p align="justify">“Agatha, I’m sorry, but you need to calm down.”</p><p align="justify">“I want to talk to my therapist.”</p><p align="justify">“We can arrange that, but not at this moment.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted loudly, crossing her arms.</p><p align="justify">“Nothing can be solved in this place!”</p><p align="justify">She left angrily, stomping her foot, walking outside. She stopped in the courtyard, took a deep breath, staring at the gray sky, wishing with all her strength that this was just a bad dream.</p><p align="justify">She opened her eyes and realized it was real. It was the end. She was there, and there was nothing she could do. Agatha began pacing back and forth, clenching her fists, her mind boiling. “Maybe I can get expelled. That will be the plan.”</p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath and turned to go back inside, but behind her was Rio, standing there again.</p><p align="justify">“Are you following me?”</p><p align="justify">“Uh… no,” Rio replied. “But you were standing right in front of the door.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted, stomped her feet on the ground, and went inside, irritated. Rio watched for a few seconds and then decided to follow her for real. Agatha noticed, of course.</p><p align="justify">“My God, what the hell are you doing!”</p><p align="justify">“Trying to see if you’re not going to have a meltdown because you’re without your Prada bag.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes, tossed her hair back, and looked Rio up and down. The uniform was technically correct, but visibly worn, and the boots were dirty.</p><p align="justify">“And what would someone like you know about Prada?”</p><p align="justify">“Nothing, actually.”</p><p align="justify">“That’s obvious. You look like you just walked out of a stable.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe I did.”</p><p align="justify">“I’d be surprised if you hadn’t,” Agatha replied, heading toward the stairs. “Are you on scholarship? That would explain the terrible state of your clothes.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe. Does it matter?”</p><p align="justify">“Nothing about you interests me. Actually, I don’t know why I’m talking to you, you strange scholarship girl. Leave me alone now.”</p><p align="justify">“See you later, my lady.” Agatha shivered at the tackiness of the expression, feeling a strange discomfort she refused to name.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify"><br/>
The first day passed. Against all expectations—including her own—Agatha had to act like a student. Sit. Listen. Pretend to pay attention. Write down things she considered useless. The French class, at least, was tolerable. Not because the content was good, but because it was almost offensively basic. Everyone there was absurdly behind compared to her. Agatha restrained herself from correcting the teacher out loud more than once. After all, she spent six months in Paris every year. That language wasn’t a subject; it was routine.</p><p align="justify">When the weekend arrived, the feeling was one of strange relief, albeit limited. It was already late at night when the room regained some appearance of life. Alice was sitting in the chair near the window, restless, while Wanda touched up some red strands of her hair with exaggerated concentration, holding the brush as if she were performing a delicate surgical procedure. The smell of dye mixed with the stuffy air of the room.</p><p align="justify">Agatha was sitting on the bed, legs crossed, holding two tanning lamps she had managed to save from the suitcase disaster. The headphones were buried in her ears, the music loud enough to create a private bubble where Ravenswood didn’t exist. She lightly bounced her leg, distracted, when she heard—despite the music—Alice’s whisper.</p><p align="justify">“I was reading the other day that Californian girls shave their asses.”</p><p align="justify">Wanda raised an eyebrow, the brush suspended in midair.</p><p align="justify">“What? Why?”</p><p align="justify">“Brazilian waxing,” Alice replied with academic seriousness. “It makes it more attractive!”</p><p align="justify">“If you say so…” Wanda murmured, going back to painting. She then glanced sideways, lowering her voice a little.</p><p align="justify"> “Do you think she’s already had… actual sex?”</p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t hesitate.</p><p align="justify">“Definitely. I think she does missionary with the alphas… and the Lebanese swing too. I can tell from afar.”</p><p align="justify">“How?” Jen asked, genuinely intrigued.</p><p align="justify"> “Oh, by the angle of the hips, right!”</p><p align="justify">The three tilted their heads almost at the same time, trying to visualize it. That was when Agatha snorted loudly, yanked the headphones from her ears, and shot a sharp look at the trio.</p><p align="justify">“Do you want something? What’s going on, huh?”</p><p align="justify">The silence lasted half a second.</p><p align="justify">“How many alphas have you slept with?” Jen asked bluntly.</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged, as if choosing an ice cream flavor.</p><p align="justify">“Well… there was Jessica. She had abs. Carol, an athlete. Monica—she has a lot of money. Oh, right… my girlfriend, a basketball star. There are a few others, but I don’t remember.”</p><p align="justify">“Jesus…” Alice murmured. She then turned toward the mirror and froze.</p><p align="justify">“DAMN IT, WANDA!” she shouted.</p><p align="justify">Alice pulled her hair forward and stared at the reflection. The strands were crooked. The red on her eyebrow was too strong, almost aggressive.<br/>
“Sorry!” Wanda said quickly. “It looked lighter on the box!”</p><p align="justify">Alice threw herself onto the bed, defeated, staring at the ceiling.</p><p align="justify"> “Damn it… I hope people still want me.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> “Sweetheart, eyebrows are the least of your problems.” Before Alice could respond, the door opened firmly. Sue entered the room, expression rigid, hands clasped.</p><p align="justify">“Lights out. Time to sleep.”</p><p align="justify">The lights went out almost immediately. The room plunged into dense half-darkness, cut only by the faint moonlight coming through the window. Agatha sat on the bed and opened her laptop with an irritated sigh.</p><p align="justify">“There’s no Wi-Fi. Surprise!”</p><p align="justify">“There’s only internet in the computer room,” Alice replied from the dark.</p><p align="justify">Agatha slammed the laptop shut and stood up.</p><p align="justify">“Hey!” Jen whispered. “We can’t get up when the lights are out.”</p><p align="justify">“Oops… are they on?” Agatha replied, feigning confusion. Before anyone could react, she stretched out her arm and slapped the switch, cutting off any remaining trace of light.</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing?!” Wanda whispered. “Go back to bed!”</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t hear. Or pretended not to.</p><p align="justify">Agatha walked down the corridor almost blind, the cold floor under her feet, her heart beating faster than she wanted to admit. The computer room was at the end of the wing, far enough away to seem forgotten—which, that night, was perfect. She slipped inside quickly, closing the door behind her with exaggerated care, and sat in front of one of the computers as if it were a clandestine act of survival.</p><p align="justify">Her fingers flew over the keyboard as soon as she opened her messaging account. The screen lit up her tense face. Without thinking much, she typed to Sarah, the words tumbling out, too full of feeling for someone who pretended not to care about anything.</p><p align="justify"><em>“Sweetie, I think I’m going to lose it. Two weeks here and I swear I’ll lose it. Damn, this place is so weird. These girls are so tacky.”</em></p><p align="justify">She was about to continue, add something sharper, maybe more dramatic, when movement in the corridor caught her attention. A shadow passed quickly across the frosted glass of the door. Agatha narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. Curiosity—her worst enemy—won. She stood up and left the room, leaving the message unfinished.</p><p align="justify">In the corridor, she recognized Alice almost immediately. The girl paced back and forth, clearly indignant, fingers tugging at the poorly dyed strands of her hair, muttering to herself. Agatha, naturally, decided to follow her. Not out of solidarity, but because she had absolutely nothing better to do.</p><p align="justify">Alice slipped discreetly into the kitchen, a space far too large for that time of night. Agatha stopped near the door and watched as the girl walked to the large industrial freezer, yanked the lid open, and pulled out a tub of ice cream. She sat right there, eating straight from the container, as if that were the only way to deal with the hair tragedy.</p><p align="justify">Agatha made a face of disgust.</p><p align="justify">“Gross,” she muttered to herself.</p><p align="justify">She turned on her heel and left, determined not to get involved in that depressing spectacle. But as soon as she stepped into the corridor, a loud noise cut through the silence—a long, shrill siii, followed by hurried footsteps and voices coming from all sides.</p><p align="justify">“Let’s go! Fire drill! To the courtyard! You already know the routine!”</p><p align="justify">Panic came fast. Agatha froze for a second. She was too far from her room. Too far from any plausible excuse. The corridors began to fill with people, doors opening, monitors appearing from all sides.</p><p align="justify">Agatha looked around desperately—and then she saw it. An open window.</p><p align="justify">She didn’t think. She simply ran to it. The window opened onto a narrow section of the roof. The cold night air hit her face as she climbed out. The roof was slanted, rough, and Agatha grimaced before even placing her hands on it.</p><p align="justify">“Disgusting…” she whispered.</p><p align="justify">Farther ahead, she spotted an iron ladder attached to the side of the building. Agatha moved toward it and began to climb slowly, gripping the rungs with extreme disgust, as if each touch were a personal sacrifice. She climbed high enough to see the courtyard below, where the students were already gathering in organized groups, perfectly aligned, as if it were a rehearsal for the end of the world.</p><p align="justify">“Great,” she murmured. “Everyone obedient. How awful.” </p><p align="justify">She continued along the roof until she noticed another open window. Without thinking twice, she climbed in. The room was dark, lit only by a soft glow coming from behind a curtain. Agatha took three steps inside before hearing a voice.</p><p align="justify">“Who’s there?”</p><p align="justify">At the same time, she heard the unmistakable sound of bathwater being disturbed. Agatha took a deep breath.</p><p align="justify">“Agatha…”</p><p align="justify">“Last name?” the voice asked, firm.</p><p align="justify">“Harkness.”</p><p align="justify">She looked around quickly. It was clearly an alpha’s room. The scent gave it away even before the decor.</p><p align="justify">“Agatha Harkness, alpha.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh… so Agatha Harkness,” the voice said, in an almost amused tone. “We’re in a fire drill.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh… sorry,” Agatha replied, trying to sound casual. “I’m new here.”</p><p align="justify">“That’s obvious,” the voice said without hesitation. “But you didn’t pay attention in physics class. Fires are dangerous, and the point is to learn how to avoid them.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t see who was speaking. The figure was completely hidden by the bathroom curtain.</p><p align="justify">“Got it…” she said. “So where do I go?”</p><p align="justify">“Go out through the door, turn left, and go down the stairs.”</p><p align="justify">“And run toward that blinking red thing, right?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” the voice replied. “And try not to get caught.” Agatha smiled faintly.</p><p align="justify">“Thanks for the tip, alpha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify"><br/>
The next day arrived without asking permission. It was still dark when the bell rang, far too aggressive for an hour that should have been a crime. Everyone was dragged out of bed almost at the same time, sleepy bodies stumbling through the cold corridors while they dressed in a rush. The morning air was sharp and damp, and the sky was beginning to lighten into a pale blue as the group headed toward the lacrosse field.</p><p align="justify">The lawn stretched out far too wide, perfectly trimmed, with white lines marked with almost military precision. The morning sun began to rise slowly, casting a golden light that made everything far too beautiful for such a hostile place. The smell of wet grass mixed with anticipated sweat and mandatory effort. Some girls stretched, others were already running obedient circles.</p><p align="justify">Agatha, of course, didn’t move.</p><p align="justify">She remained standing at the edge of the field, arms crossed, body motionless as if glued to the ground. She watched everything with an expression of absolute boredom, like someone watching a particularly uninteresting documentary about worker ants. Her eyes followed Melina, who walked back and forth commanding an entire troop of aligned students, all holding lacrosse sticks with exaggerated seriousness, as if they were about to go to war.</p><p align="justify">Melina shouted orders, corrected posture, handed out tasks, perfectly comfortable in her role as authoritarian leader. The students responded promptly, running, forming lines, raising their sticks at the same time. A small disciplined army. Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p align="justify">Lacrosse, to her complete lack of luck, wasn’t just “some weird sport.” It was a game that mixed intense running, strategy, physical strength, and socially acceptable aggression. Each player held a long stick with a net at the end, used to carry, throw, and contest a small hard ball. The goal was simple in theory: advance across the field with quick passes and throw the ball into the opposing goal. In practice, it was controlled chaos. Allowed shoves, constant physical contact, strategic falls, absurd speed. A sport that required endurance, coordination, teamwork—and the thing that irritated Agatha the most—</p><p align="justify">—obedience.</p><p align="justify">She watched the girls run under the sun, the sound of balls hitting the nets, the shouts of encouragement, the sharp commands. Some stumbled, others laughed nervously, others seemed genuinely happy there. Agatha shifted more of her weight onto one leg, completely detached from the collective effort.</p><p align="justify">“This is definitely a cult,” she murmured to herself.</p><p align="justify">As Melina passed by inspecting the formation, sharp eyes scanning the field for any mistake, Agatha remained firm in her silent decision not to participate. She didn’t run. She didn’t stretch. She didn’t hold a stick. She simply stood there, absorbing the sun on her face as if she were on a balcony in Saint-Tropez, not at a British boarding school in the middle of nowhere.</p><p align="justify">The sun was already higher when the training session finally came to an end. The girls, sweaty, panting, and with faces flushed from effort, gathered in small groups while dropping their sticks on the ground. The smell of warm grass, sweat, and dust hung in the air. Professor Peggy clapped her hands, satisfied, a wide smile on her face as if it had all been a great collective success.</p><p align="justify">“Very well, girls! That was great!” she said cheerfully. “We may not win the championship, but we’ll gain many friends.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha, standing with the stick hanging loosely in her hand, tilted her head slightly and commented out loud, making no effort whatsoever to hide her disdain:</p><p align="justify">“That’s so English.”</p><p align="justify">A few nervous giggles rippled around. Melina, who had been irritated since early morning, turned slowly, a short, venomous smile appearing on her lips.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, really?” she said with a fake little laugh. “And you can do better?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her eyes shining with challenge.</p><p align="justify">“Are you laughing?” she asked, taking a step forward. “Because I’d finish you in two seconds.”</p><p align="justify">“That I’d pay to see,” Melina replied, not backing down.</p><p align="justify">Agatha then grabbed her pink lacrosse stick, far too flashy for that somber environment, spinning it lightly in her hand like someone who had already decided the outcome.</p><p align="justify">“You’re in the clown’s hands now,” Agatha said, walking to the center of the field. </p><p align="justify">“If I were you, I’d get out of here, Horse Face.”</p><p align="justify">Professor Peggy, sensing the tension, hurried to the center of the field, placed the ball between the two, and began reviewing the basic rules, talking about positioning, time, and safety. But Melina and Agatha were already far too gone to hear any rules. For both of them, this was no longer a game.</p><p align="justify">Agatha ripped the plastic off the head of the stick with a sharp movement, adjusting her grip, the muscles in her arm tense. Melina, on the other side, dug her feet into the ground, leaning forward like a bull about to charge, eyes locked on Agatha.</p><p align="justify">The whistle blew.</p><p align="justify">The two ran at the same time to capture the ball—and what should have been a sports dispute turned, in seconds, into an awkward and violent physical fight. Shoulder to shoulder, sticks dropped, the two tangled on the ground, rolling in the grass amid shocked shouts and nervous laughter from the other students.</p><p align="justify">Before the fight could continue, a loud, unexpected car horn cut through the chaos. Both froze. Then they stood up, still panting, hair disheveled, clothes smeared with grass.</p><p align="justify">A black convertible was parked nearby, close to the field. Inside it, Rio watched the scene with an amused expression, elbow resting on the open door.</p><p align="justify">“Shouldn’t you be wearing bikinis to fight like that?” she commented with a half-smile. Melina immediately changed her posture, smoothing her uniform, trying to recover some dignity.</p><p align="justify">“Hi, Riozita…” she said, forcing a casual tone. “Loved the car.”</p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head and smiled faintly.</p><p align="justify">“Hello, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked.</p><p align="justify">“Hi…” she said, confused for a second. “Wait—what?”</p><p align="justify">And then she simply turned toward the steering wheel and drove off.</p><p align="justify">“Bye, then.” Melina stared after her, incredulous, then turned to Agatha, her voice rising.</p><p align="justify">“Uhh… are you into Riozita?” she taunted. “Do you want to kiss Riozita on the mouth?”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t be childish!” Melina snapped, starting to lose her patience.</p><p align="justify">“Who are you trying to fool, my dear?” Agatha continued mercilessly. “You can tell by that sweat mustache of yours that you’re dying to suck that—”</p><p align="justify">“Enough!” Professor Peggy shouted.</p><p align="justify">Despite the attempt at authority, laughter was already echoing across the field. Melina, humiliated and furious, marched off toward the building, her face red with anger. Her friends ran after her, trying to catch up and calm her down.</p><p align="justify">“How does Riozita know her name?!” Melina screamed as soon as she entered the building. “Get out!” she yelled at a young student who was arranging her room.</p><p align="justify">“But the bed still—”</p><p align="justify">“OUT!” She began pacing back and forth, gesturing wildly, completely out of control.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t understand… she likes me. Rio likes me! Why did she look at her? She… she looked at her… to pretend she was looking at you,” one of the girls said quickly, trying to please her.</p><p align="justify">“She needs to be careful,” another lied. “She can’t get caught. And if Rio looked at you too much, she wouldn’t be able to control herself. You know when I need to make a sad face, I think about slaughtered horses? For Rio, Agatha is like a slaughtered horse.”</p><p align="justify">Melina took a deep breath, absorbing it.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah… you’re probably right,” she said, calmer now, though her eyes were still full of anger. “But we’re going to have to deal with that Miss Nose-in-the-Air. She needs to know who’s in charge here.”</p><p align="justify">She crossed her arms, resolute.</p><p align="justify">“I believe so.”</p><p align="justify">The principal’s office door flew open without warning, as if it were just another rule broken on the endless list Agatha seemed to be collecting since she arrived at Ravenswood.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, just so you know: I didn’t start it, it wasn’t my fault!”</p><p align="justify">She entered already talking, body leaning forward, finger almost pointing, ready to defend herself from a judgment that hadn’t even begun.</p><p align="justify">“Leave and close the door,” Lorna asked calmly, without lifting her eyes from the page she was reading, her voice low and firm—the kind of authority that didn’t need to be imposed.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped in the middle of the room, confused for half a second.</p><p align="justify">“Huh… you’re the one who called me?”</p><p align="justify">Lorna finally lifted her gaze.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. But you need to knock before entering.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes hard, taking a deep breath.</p><p align="justify">“Seriously, it’s all Horse Face’s fault.”</p><p align="justify">She stepped out, slammed the door harder than necessary, and knocked again—this time theatrically.</p><p align="justify">“Who is it?” Lorna asked from inside.</p><p align="justify">“Jesus Christ,” Agatha replied, opening the door and stepping in right after.</p><p align="justify">“Wow… and I thought Lord Jesus wore a beard and sandals. Now I’ll have to change the stained-glass window in the school chapel.”</p><p align="justify">Lorna kept her expression neutral, but there was a contained, amused glint in her eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Look, I didn’t provoke anything. It wasn’t my fault. And if I were in America, I’d sue. That over there is an alpha defender, not an omega.” Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p align="justify">“She needs a sedative.”</p><p align="justify">"I know perfectly well what happened," Lorna said, resting her pen on the desk.<br/>
Agatha frowned.</p><p align="justify"> "Then why isn’t she here too?"</p><p align="justify">"Because, obviously, it’s you I want to talk to." Agatha opened her mouth to retort, but Lorna continued before she could.</p><p align="justify">"Look, I know it’s very difficult to be the only newcomer in your year."</p><p align="justify">"I mean, the only normal person," Agatha corrected immediately. Lorna smiled faintly and leaned back against the desk, crossing her arms calmly.</p><p align="justify"> "What do you like to read, Agatha?" Agatha blinked, caught off guard.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, I don’t know… gossip magazines. The good kind for the weekend."</p><p align="justify">"Would you be able to read something like… a book?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged.</p><p align="justify">"Well, I prefer movies."</p><p align="justify">"Well, I don’t think I have the book that inspired <em>Freaky Friday</em>," Lorna said, walking over to the bookshelf. "But you can start by reading this one."</p><p align="justify">She handed a book to Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> "Oh, my uncle is producing the movie version," Agatha replied automatically.</p><p align="justify"> "<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>," Lorna said. "It was a book first. You might be surprised and end up liking it." Agatha took the book with both hands, examining the cover as if it were a suspicious object.</p><p align="justify">"Is this my punishment? This school is bizarre."</p><p align="justify">Lorna went back to the desk and sat down, crossing her arms calmly.</p><p align="justify">"Do you want to take anything away from this school, Agatha?"</p><p align="justify">"I want to take myself away from this school!" Lorna didn’t flinch.</p><p align="justify">"This school hasn’t produced many celebrities. But we’ve produced intelligent girls, opinionated, independent, kind-hearted, sharp… and who stay friends forever."</p><p align="justify">She paused briefly, watching Agatha closely.<br/>
"The kind of girl who, despite your little jokes, I know you are."</p><p align="justify">Agatha remained silent, the book still in her hands, her expression closed off but less combative.</p><p align="justify">"You may go now," Lorna concluded, turning her eyes back to the papers on the desk. "I have a lot of paperwork waiting for me."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stayed there for a second longer than she would like to admit… and then turned to leave, taking the book with her.</p><p align="justify">Melina was sitting in her room like a bored queen in a castle she considered far too small for herself. The room was in complete controlled chaos: clothes thrown over the bed, open bottles, the strong smell of dye mixed with expensive perfume that stubbornly clung to everything. </p><p align="justify">In front of her, kneeling on the floor with an improvised basin, was a young first-year student, far too focused not to tremble, dyeing Melina’s cardigan a brown that was clearly still not to her liking.</p><p align="justify">"It has to be stronger," Melina shouted, crossing her arms. "It’s not brown enough. Add more dye."</p><p align="justify">The girl hurriedly obeyed, pouring more dark liquid into the water. The fabric slowly began to darken. Melina suddenly stood, approaching like a cruel supervisor.</p><p align="justify">"Move your arm more!" she ordered. "You’re putting color into that like it’s tea! It has to be authentic."</p><p align="justify">The student stirred harder, her arms already aching. Satisfied enough for now, Melina stepped away and walked to the window. </p><p align="justify">She opened it and inhaled deeply the late-afternoon air, the sky tinted with shades of orange and gray. The cold wind hit her face, bringing distant voices from the courtyard with it.</p><p align="justify">That was when she looked down.</p><p align="justify">Agatha was sitting right below the window, sprawled out, leaning against the wall, apparently oblivious to the world, as if the entire school were nothing more than an inconvenient backdrop. Melina’s blood boiled instantly.</p><p align="justify">"That’s enough," she said sharply, extending her hand. "Give it to me."</p><p align="justify">She ripped the wet cardigan from the student’s hands and leaned out the window.</p><p align="justify">"Pour the water out the window." The girl froze.</p><p align="justify">"Are you sure?" she asked, hesitantly. Melina slowly turned her face, her gaze sharp.</p><p align="justify">"I said: pour it."</p><p align="justify">Trembling, the student lifted the basin and dumped everything out. The scream came immediately, loud and indignant, echoing across the courtyard. Melina leaned against the window frame, tilting her body outward with a satisfied smile.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, I’m so sorry…" she said in a fake tone of regret. "You can’t trust the help."</p><p align="justify">She tilted her head, feigning curiosity.</p><p align="justify">"Do you have permission to be out of the classroom?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha slowly lifted her face, soaked, hair dripping, eyes blazing with hatred. Without saying anything in the first second, she shoved her hand into her pocket, pulled it out, and raised her middle finger high, aimed at the window.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, do I?" she replied. "Right here, you cow." And she walked away, every step heavy with rage, leaving a trail of water behind her.</p><p align="justify">"Don’t step on the grass!" Melina shouted, before slamming the window shut.</p><p align="justify">The sharp sound of the glass echoed through the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify">The rest of the day grew significantly worse when Agatha discovered, in a way almost too cruel to be real, that Melina dyed clothes with coffee and cheap dye and that, as a direct consequence, the perm she had done so carefully was completely ruined. Her hair felt strange to the touch, carrying a lingering smell of stale drink and improvised chemicals, and that was the final blow. There was simply no will left, no excitement, no anger strong enough inside her body. Only exhaustion. A heavy exhaustion that seemed to have lodged itself in her bones.</p><p align="justify">Agatha curled up by the bedroom window, sitting sideways, her body carelessly folded, staring outside without really seeing anything. The English sky was gray as always, the cold seeping through the cracks, and on the windowsill there was a small ornament that read “I love Los Angeles.” The object seemed out of place there, almost ridiculous, too colorful for that dull scenery, as if it were slowly losing its shine along with her.</p><p align="justify">The bedroom door opened, but Agatha didn’t pay enough attention. The sound no longer bothered her. Wanda came in and, for a brief second, the two exchanged a quick look. Wanda sighed, rolling her eyes before even speaking.</p><p align="justify">"For the tenth time, you need to make your bed."</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t respond. She kept looking outside, as if the window glass were a movie screen playing a film only she could see.</p><p align="justify">"Seriously, what’s so hard about it?" Wanda said, walking over to the bed. She grabbed Agatha’s pink comforter, lifted it, and spread it with a simple, efficient movement. "There. Simple. Anyone can do it."</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed deeply and stood up in silence. She began making the bed in a completely clumsy way, pulling the sheet crooked, folding it wrong, clearly without any patience. Wanda rolled her eyes once again, stepped closer, and pulled everything back, fixing it properly in a few seconds.</p><p align="justify">"Let me do it."</p><p align="justify">In moments, the bed was impeccable. Agatha let out another sigh and sat down, defeated.</p><p align="justify">"Thanks."</p><p align="justify">"You’re freezing, put something warm on," Wanda said, watching her more closely.</p><p align="justify">"Actually, I don’t think I have anything warmer," Agatha replied, her voice low.</p><p align="justify">"Dude, I only brought some little tops… I didn’t even bring a jacket."Wanda walked over to the dresser, opened a drawer, and tossed a coat onto Agatha.</p><p align="justify">"Thanks," she said, putting it on. "I guess I didn’t come prepared." But Wanda was already distracted, laughing at a phone screen.</p><p align="justify">"The worst part is seeing that the only message you got was from the phone company." Agatha frowned.</p><p align="justify">"What? Inspector Sue took everyone’s phones."</p><p align="justify">"No," Wanda said, sitting down. "She took yours, and our fake ones. She doesn’t know they don’t work. We hid the real ones." Wanda then handed the phone to Agatha.</p><p align="justify">"Here. Call your parents, your therapist. Have fun." Agatha hesitated before taking the device.</p><p align="justify">"But why are you doing this for me? I know you think I’m an idiot." Wanda tilted her head.</p><p align="justify">"No. You behave like an idiot. It’s different." She paused.</p><p align="justify">"Look, I’m no Los Angeles therapist, but it’s obvious you’re scared… and homesick."</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly.</p><p align="justify">"Which, in my experience, doesn’t make you a bad person. It makes you normal." Agatha sighed, glancing sideways.</p><p align="justify">"What a beautiful photo," Wanda said, picking up a picture frame from the bedside table. "Is that your mother?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes…"</p><p align="justify">"Does she come here to visit you?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed again, heavier.</p><p align="justify"> "She had a car accident when I was seven."</p><p align="justify">"Oh… Agatha, I’m so sorry." Agatha only nodded.</p><p align="justify">"I know you’re not a Los Angeles therapist…"</p><p align="justify">Silence settled between them, dense but not uncomfortable. Wanda carefully returned the picture frame to the nightstand.</p><p align="justify">"Look," she said, "do you really want to get out of here?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes…"</p><p align="justify">"Then you need to find some way to get expelled."</p><p align="justify">"Hm… cool…"Wanda thought for a few seconds.</p><p align="justify">"Anyone who behaves inappropriately will be subject to expulsion by the Court of Honor."</p><p align="justify">"Court of Honor?"</p><p align="justify">"It’s like a trial held in front of the entire school. Your classmates, teachers, the student council president, and Mrs. Wu." She raised a finger.</p><p align="justify">"But I’ll warn you now: that rarely happens. If you really want to be expelled, you can’t rock the boat. You have to sink it. Set the kitchen on fire and dance on the burning deck. You’ll have to do it very well."</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged, a small smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.</p><p align="justify">"Yes, ma’am. Ma’am."</p><p align="justify">"You can call," Wanda said, handing over the phone as she stood up. "Oh, and the best signal is on top of the wardrobe."</p><p align="justify">Agatha thanked her with a nod. Wanda left, closing the door behind her. The omega walked over to the wardrobe, climbed up carefully, and positioned the phone at the exact spot. The signal wasn’t strong enough for a call, but Agatha managed to send a video message. She took a deep breath before pressing record, feeling the weight of longing, cold, and loneliness finally crash down all at once.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">In Los Angeles, the sun was still high when Sarah’s phone vibrated on the glass table, between two colorful glasses and a forgotten plate of snacks far too expensive for anyone to actually eat. Low music filled the spacious, modern apartment, with huge windows that let the golden city pour in without asking permission. Sarah picked up the phone without any hurry, a lazy smile already forming before she even saw who it was from.</p><p align="justify">"Look at this…" she said, leaning back into the couch.</p><p align="justify">She opened the video message and Agatha’s image appeared on the screen: the strange hair, the tired face, the coat far too big thrown over her shoulders, the gray, depressing background that screamed England without needing subtitles. Sarah let out a short laugh, almost automatic.</p><p align="justify">"My God…" she murmured. "What did they do to her?"</p><p align="justify">Beside her, leaning against the back of the couch, was a friend of Agatha’s, legs stretched out, a drink in hand, clearly far too comfortable for someone who should feel any kind of guilt. She leaned in to get a better look at the screen.</p><p align="justify">"That’s Agatha?" she asked, eyes widening. "I swear I thought she was an extra in a period movie."</p><p align="justify">Sarah laughed louder now.</p><p align="justify">"Look at that coat!" she said, pausing the video halfway through. "It looks like she stole it from an eighty-year-old woman on her way to feed pigeons."</p><p align="justify">"Girl…" the other tilted her head, evaluating with cruelty. "She looks like she got kicked out of her own closet."</p><p align="justify">"I warned her that this boarding school would ruin her," Sarah replied, still laughing.</p><p align="justify">"She was born for Los Angeles, not for this…" she made a vague gesture with her hand, "…fancy cemetery."</p><p align="justify">The friend flopped down beside her on the couch, resting her chin on Sarah’s shoulder as the video kept playing, Agatha talking, complaining, trying to sound strong despite the obvious exhaustion.</p><p align="justify">"She’s dramatic even when she’s suffering," she commented. "Kind of pathetic."</p><p align="justify">"She always has been," Sarah said, with a crooked smile. "Agatha likes to suffer with an audience."</p><p align="justify">She pressed play again just to hear the part where Agatha mentioned the cold, the strange place, the tacky people. Sarah rolled her eyes.</p><p align="justify">"'I’m freezing'…" she repeated mockingly. "Love, then buy a decent coat."</p><p align="justify">"Or come back home," the friend added, laughing.</p><p align="justify">Sarah locked the screen and tossed the phone aside, as if the message had already served its only purpose: entertainment.</p><p align="justify">"Are you going to reply?" the other asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">Sarah thought for half a second, then shrugged.</p><p align="justify">"Later. Or never." She smiled. "She can deal with it. She’ll learn the world doesn’t revolve around her." The friend raised her glass.</p><p align="justify">"To the downfall of the rich girls."</p><p align="justify">Sarah clinked her glass against hers.</p><p align="justify">"To England doing what I never had the patience to do." Sarah’s phone remained forgotten on the table, Agatha’s message still open, frozen on that image of her in a coat far too big, far too alone, while miles away, life went on with no intention of waiting for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p>

The entire room was submerged in absolute darkness, and her only source of light came from the small lighter in her hand, the flickering flame illuminating just enough to reveal the pages of the book Lorna had given her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> The shadows danced across the walls with every movement of the flame, stretching the outlines of the furniture and turning the room into something almost unrecognizable. The faint smell of gas mixed with old paper created a strangely intimate atmosphere, far too silent for a mind that never stopped racing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The dry sound of wood being stepped on suddenly echoed through the room, a crack too clear to be ignored. Agatha froze. The lighter’s flame wavered for a second as the blonde lifted her head, her eyes trying to adjust to the total darkness.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> The room seemed to have been swallowed by pitch black, so dense it gave the sensation that something was moving inside it. She slowly turned her head, her heart racing, but saw nothing beyond motionless shadows.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>After a few tense seconds, Agatha shrugged, forcing her breathing to calm. Of course, she thought. This place is old—creaking comes with the package. She turned her attention back to the book, carefully relighting the flame and letting the words reclaim her thoughts.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>That was when, without any warning, flashlights suddenly turned on, aimed directly at her face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Jesus!" Agatha exclaimed, bringing her free hand to her chest, the lighter nearly slipping from her fingers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The harsh light blinded her for a moment, and when she managed to focus, she saw Wanda beside the bed with a grin far too wide for that hour of the night, holding a flashlight. Next to her, Jen and Alice did the same, their expressions a mix of excitement and youthful conspiracy.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Careful, Madame Owl," Wanda said, amused, "or you’re going to set us all on fire."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha let out a low laugh, still a bit shaken, closing the book carefully and extinguishing the lighter, as if she’d been caught doing something forbidden.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’re sick," she muttered, but without any real irritation.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda stepped a little closer, lowering the flashlight.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"So here’s the deal, I talked to the girls," she began, in an almost solemn tone, "and of course, it was easier to convince some than others."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>As she spoke, she tossed the flashlight toward Jen.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Hey!" Jen complained, blinking.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"But it’s decided," Wanda continued, ignoring the interruption. "We’re going to help you. We’ll be your elite squad. Operation Freedom."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She crossed her arms, clearly pleased with the name.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Alice, explain, please." Alice straightened her posture as if she were about to present an important assignment, pointing the flashlight dramatically at her own face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Attention," she began, far too solemn. "We’re starting with a very basic prank."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The days passed far too quickly, as if time itself had decided to cooperate with Operation Freedom. The plan was no longer just a crazy idea whispered in the dark of the bedroom—it was a machine in motion, precise, synchronized, cruel enough to work.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> The first prank was the most classic one. And perhaps the dirtiest, in every sense. The red phone booth, an almost touristic symbol of that antiquated school, woke up plastered inside and out with fake flyers.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Melina’s face was printed in black and white, smiling in a way she never truly smiled, accompanied by a carefully ambiguous phrase claiming she was offering "services." Services—if anyone even needed a caption to understand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha was inside the booth when she glued the last papers in place, making a deep grimace.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This place smells like piss from at least three generations," she complained, holding her breath as she smoothed the flyer against the wall. "I swear, if I catch some medieval disease, I’m suing this entire country."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Move it," Wanda whispered, keeping watch in the corridor. "It’s part of the sacrifice."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Sacrifice my ass," Agatha muttered. "This is chemical torture."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Even so, she finished the job. Minutes later, the damage was done. Students walking by, muffled laughter, sideways comments—and most importantly—the school’s landline phone starting to ring nonstop. "Innocent" questions. Voices pretending interest. Melina slowly losing her mind.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>But it didn’t stop there. The second prank came right after, despite Alice trying to impose some kind of criminal ethics.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It can’t be the same prank," she said, far too serious. "It has to escalate. Always escalate."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They escalated.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The pool was the target. During the early morning hours, dyes, improper substances, and things that definitely didn’t belong in pool water were dumped inside. By morning, what had once been blue had turned into a grotesque mix of undefined colors, smelling like a laboratory.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Swimming classes were canceled. Screams. Staff running back and forth. Melina trying to command something that had completely slipped out of control.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>And then came the most serious prank. The one that crossed a dangerous line—and they all knew it.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>In French translation class, the texts handed out to all students were not the originals. Instead, each sheet contained, perfectly written in impeccable French, a piece of gossip too heavy to ignore: it claimed the teacher had been looking at photos of students on the school website. That he had accessed private images. That it was serious. Very serious.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The teacher began reading aloud and went pale.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence in the room was immediate, followed by nervous whispers. The man panicked, stuttered, tried to justify himself, asked to collect the sheets. Administration was called. The atmosphere turned into absolute chaos.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Everything at once.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Melina receiving calls on the school’s landline, each worse than the last. The pool destroyed, isolated with tape. The teacher in panic, surrounded by accusations printed in French.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>And in the middle of it all, hidden in a strategic corner, Alice looked at Agatha with a seriousness that contrasted with the playful gleam in her eyes.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And you have to take the blame for everything."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha crossed her arms, watching the chaos from afar. The entire school seemed on the verge of collapse. Internal sirens, teachers running, students whispering. Ravenswood had never been so alive.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She thought for one second. Just one. Then she smiled.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Deal."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The explosion truly hit during French class. The teacher had been nervous from the start, his forehead shiny with sweat as he tried to maintain some control over the room. The students repeated the text in unison, French phrases spilling through the room like a chorus far too strange for that morning—phrases that definitely should not have existed anywhere.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> One of the phrases emitted by the French CD even included an insult toward the son of a woman whose profession was the oldest in the world.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Filho da puta" — "Fils de pute"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>There was something wrong in the air; everyone felt it, but no one knew exactly what. Until the teacher decided to interrupt.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Un instant…" he murmured, approaching the sound system with hurried steps.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>He picked up the CD that was playing, spun the disc between his fingers, his eyes narrowing as he read what was written in permanent marker on the silver surface.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Property of Agatha Harkness."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence that fell was absolute. A heavy, suffocating silence, followed by a growing murmur, as if the entire room had inhaled at the same time.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What…?" the teacher stammered, his voice failing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The students began turning to one another, whispers exploding in every direction. Some laughed nervously, others widened their eyes, others were already discreetly pointing at Agatha, who sat with her legs crossed, chin resting on her hand, watching everything with an almost offensive calm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Sir…" one student tried.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This is inadmissible," said another. The teacher dropped the CD onto the desk as if it were burning his fingers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Administration. Now."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The word echoed like a sentence.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Chaos settled in too quickly to be contained. Within minutes, the administration office was filled with raised voices, teachers talking over one another, papers being slammed onto the desk, hands gesturing wildly.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> The French teacher was pale, repeating that it was all a misunderstanding, that he would never do such a thing. Other faculty complained about the destroyed pool, the obscene calls to the school phone, the flyers spread around the phone booth.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Ravenswood was in a state of emergency. In the midst of it all, Agatha was guided to a chair, sitting with her back straight, her face far too neutral for someone at the center of an institutional implosion. She observed each adult losing their composure with almost scientific interest.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Outside, leaning against the corridor wall, Alice crossed her arms and leaned toward Wanda and Jen, her voice low but firm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"She’s going to have to give in to the pressure," she said. "They’re going to call Agatha’s father."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda swallowed hard.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And if Agatha gets lucky…" Alice continued, her eyes fixed on the closed administration door. "The principal will invoke the Court of Honor."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen took a deep breath, feeling the real weight of it for the first time. Inside, Principal Lorna finally slammed her hand on the desk, demanding silence. The teachers gradually quieted, still breathless, still indignant.</span></p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The door burst open violently, slamming against the wall, and Melina stormed in like a barely contained tempest, her face red, eyes blazing with fury. She threw her bag onto the bed and began pacing back and forth, her hands gesturing wildly, as if the very air were to blame for everything.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!" she screamed. "That bitch has more lives than a Buddhist cat!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She stopped in the middle of the room, breathing heavily, then started pacing again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"All of this happened," she continued, her voice rising, "and they didn’t even mention it! Mrs. Wu! She didn’t even mention the Court of Honor!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She seemed genuinely offended—not just as a person, but as if a sacred order had been violated. One of her friends, sitting on the bed and nervously picking at her nails, spoke carefully.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"People are starting to like her…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Melina spun around, incredulous.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"People?!" she repeated, laughing without humor. "People can get used to pig vomit if they live with it long enough!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The room fell silent for a moment. Another classmate, leaning against the wall, ventured:</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I think she’s trying to get expelled. It would be a nightmare if she stayed… she ridicules the institution’s name…" Melina let out a short laugh, loaded with disdain, running a hand through her hair like someone who had already decided the ending of that story.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"She won’t stay. Trust me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She stopped in front of the window, lifting her chin proudly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Five generations of my family have honored this place." She slowly turned to her friends.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "The school’s motto is culture, friendship, and loyalty." Her voice hardened. "Not sleaze, vulgarity, and idiocy."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The girls nodded—some convinced, others simply too afraid to disagree. Melina took a deep breath, certain of herself, like someone who believes the world inevitably bends to tradition.</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha and Wanda were running across the side courtyard, cold wind hitting their faces, quick footsteps echoing on the stone ground. Both laughed between breathless gasps, adrenaline still far too high to allow any moral reflection. A green car was parked there, discreet enough not to draw attention, as if it were waiting exactly for them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come on!" Wanda whispered, pulling Agatha by the arm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They both rushed into the car, movements clumsy with urgency and the adrenaline still pounding in their chests.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Agatha twisted the key hard and, without thinking twice, shoved a cassette tape into the old tape deck, yanking the volume knob without any delicacy.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The car was a green Morris Minor convertible, too old to look discreet and far too charming not to attract attention. The engine coughed before starting, a fragile sound that made Wanda hold her breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come on, come on…" Wanda whispered, nervously checking the rearview mirror.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>But before they could even pull away, the sound of another car approaching made both their stomachs drop. Headlights cut through the courtyard’s gloom.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Agatha’s eyes widened and, without thinking, she turned off the engine. They exchanged a quick look—complicit and terrified—and then threw themselves out of the car, crawling to hide underneath it, cold gravel pressing into their hands and knees.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A black car stopped nearby. Doors opened. The scent arrived before any words—dense, striking, unmistakable.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Alphas…" Wanda murmured, barely moving her lips.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha’s heart raced when she recognized Sue’s shoes appearing in her limited field of view beneath the car. Firm heels, rigid posture.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Alphas," a dry voice repeated.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Hey, relax, Cerberus," Natasha said, raising her hands in a conciliatory gesture, her voice loaded with calm irony.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha frowned, confused, and whispered almost soundlessly:</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Who’s Cerberus?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda leaned a bit closer, her face serious despite the absurd situation.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"The dog that guards the gates of hell." Agatha swallowed hard, wanting to laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Let’s be quick," said another voice, far too calm for all that tension.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio. Agatha’s stomach flipped just from recognizing the timbre.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Quick," Rio continued. "You’re distracting my omegas," she said as Sue turned to go inside.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha noticed, from her limited angle, that several shadows moved in the building’s windows. Curious silhouettes, faces pressed to the glass. All watching the alphas outside, as if it were a forbidden spectacle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio took a few steps forward, casually tossing the car key into the air, a gesture far too relaxed for someone being watched. The key spun… and fell to the ground with a dry clink.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Shit," she muttered, quickly bending down to pick it up.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>It was at that exact moment that her eyes met those of the two girls hiding under the Morris Minor.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha’s eyes widened and she brought a finger to her lips in a desperate plea for silence. Wanda, beside her, practically begged with her eyes for Rio to just leave, to walk away, to pretend she hadn’t seen anything.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio picked up the key, hesitated for a nearly imperceptible second, and then stood up as if nothing had happened. But Agatha wasn’t as lucky. The accumulated dust beneath the car rose with the movement, going straight into her nose. She tried to hold it in, held her breath, bit her lip—but it was useless.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Ah-choo!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue immediately turned, raising an eyebrow with sharp suspicion. Before anything could be said, Rio lifted a hand to her own nose.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Ah-choo," she repeated, in a clearly fake sneeze, too delicate, too polite to be real.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue stared at her for a few seconds, evaluating.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Terrible allergy… sorry," Rio added, with irritating naturalness.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue grimaced slightly, seeming to accept the explanation. And then, as if the universe itself conspired in favor of chaos, Agatha couldn’t resist.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>With her hand still hidden under the car, she made an obscene noise—a short, unmistakable fart sound. Rio didn’t even blink.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oops… sorry," she said immediately, with the most shameless face in the world.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue took a step back, disgust written all over her face, bringing a hand to her nose.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Honestly…" she muttered, visibly disturbed. Agatha bit her fist to keep from laughing out loud. Wanda shook beside her, half panic, half absolute delight.</span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify"><span>Later, the group was gathered in the communal bathroom, thick with hot steam and the sweet smell of soap. The four of them were spread out in the four bathtubs, all filled with foam to the brim, bubbles spilling over the old tiles as if the place were trying to be luxurious and failing miserably.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The low ceiling trapped the steam, making the air heavy, and the fogged windows barely let in the cold late-afternoon light. Wanda sank a little deeper into the water, letting out a long, almost dramatic sigh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Dude… it’s like you’re immune," she said, running a hand through her wet hair.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Is your dad a mob boss or something?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha, lazily reclined in the tub, merely lifted her chin with an arrogant half-smile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yeah… I’m the powerful daughter."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice, sitting in the tub beside her, swirled the foam with her fingertips, her expression more serious than usual.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Whatever it is, she’s giving you way too much slack," she said. "Way too much. This isn’t normal."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen nodded, tossing foam into the air.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"We’re going to have to go harder."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice straightened her body, as if about to present a military plan.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Actually, we’re going to have to focus on her greatest weakness."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda rose a bit too much, nearly spilling water over the edge of the tub.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"My God… you’re going to have to osculate Rio!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha immediately wrinkled her nose.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"osculate?" she repeated. "That sounds disgusting. What is that?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen rolled her eyes.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Kiss, in short. Make out with her."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence that followed lasted exactly two seconds.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Mrs. Wu is going to be furious," Jen continued, "for breaking the dating rule."</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "And Melina is definitely going to have a meltdown," Alice added, far too satisfied.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha opened a slow, dangerous smile.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "That alone would already be worth it."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda pointed at her with a wet finger.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "And she’s going to the party. Don’t forget: the goal is to get caught."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha blinked.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "What’s this thing about a party?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen leaned forward in the bathtub, splashing foam.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "It’s the Saturday night party. Traditionally, it’s a costume ball. It’ll be on the last Saturday of the month."</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "The theme is ‘movie magic,’" Alice added.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda snorted.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "But the only ones who wear costumes are the teachers, the clueless girls… and Melina."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha smiled in a way that made it clear that this was exactly the kind of information she needed.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Then I think we should go all out."</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "And mock it hard," she added, satisfied.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda sighed, sinking back into the water.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "This mission needs to be well planned… Alice."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice opened a slow, almost malicious smile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Operation Part 2." She raised two soapy fingers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Item 1: attract Rio." "Item 1, subsection A: wardrobe." Jen burst out laughing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come on, Alice, you’re making something really cool sound like homework."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The four of them started laughing, the foam trembling with the movement.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"In short," Alice said at last, "we’re going into town to buy very sexy clothes." Wanda rested her head on the edge of the bathtub, thoughtful.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I want something elegant…" she paused dramatically, "but at the same time slutty and shameless."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Laughter exploded through the bathroom, echoing off the old tiles. There, surrounded by steam, foam, and absurd plans, they sealed the next step. Operation Freedom would not only continue — it was about to get personal.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Agatha, you have one week to make her fall for you." Wanda’s eyes widened.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Only one week? You’re cruel." Jen tilted her head, assessing Agatha as if she were analyzing a freshly loaded weapon.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s not ‘like.’ It’s fall. There’s a difference."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha, oblivious to the pressure, washed herself with excessive calm, sliding the soap over her arms as if it were the least important subject in the world. When she answered, it was with the unbearable calm of someone who had always believed the world obeyed her rhythm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Easy…" she said, splashing water over her shoulders. "You just don’t treat her like a trophy or a problem."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda scoffed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Look at her. The strategic rich girl." Agatha smiled lazily, far too confident.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You want me to get caught," she finished. "So I’m not going to run. I’ll let it happen." </span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence that followed was brief, heavy, and full of expectation. Alice was the first to smile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Perfect."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The morning of the first Saturday arrived like a small betrayal to the gray atmosphere Agatha had already begun to associate with that place. Finally, a free day. When she opened her eyes, still half in disbelief, it was the sunlight pouring through the window that made her blink twice, as if she were staring at a mirage.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The golden light crossed the old glass, spreading warmth through the room that was far too cold for her taste. Agatha sat up in bed with a slow, satisfied smile, feeling something close to victory just from that.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She got up without making any effort to be quiet and walked over to Wanda, who was sleeping deeply, tangled in the blanket.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s sunny, hey, Wanda," Agatha said, lightly shaking the mattress.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Agatha… let me sleep…" Wanda muttered, burying her face even deeper into the pillow.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha rolled her eyes theatrically.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well, die of depression then, and without sun I’m going," she announced, already grabbing her toiletries and leaving the room.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She walked down the corridor with light steps, almost too energetic for that hour, being greeted by a few still-sleepy students. She stopped in a small improvised line for the bathroom, which earned her an impatient sigh, and waited long enough to finally get in.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>All the bathtubs were occupied, steam escaping from behind the curtains, so Agatha settled for one of the showers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She showered without haste, washing her hair carefully, as if it were a ritual of personal reconstruction. The hot water ran down her shoulders, carrying away some of the irritation accumulated over the past few days. When she finished, she dressed decisively: riding pants, well-fitted boots, and a thin tank top that contrasted far too much with the usual uniform of that school.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Secretly — and not so secretly — Agatha had discovered that the school offered horseback riding classes on weekends. And well… what attracted more alphas than horses and outdoor adrenaline?</span></p><p align="justify"><span>After brushing her hair, she returned to the room. Nothing had changed. Everyone was still asleep, sprawled across their beds as if the world could wait.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha put away her bath kit, then applied cherry-flavored pink gloss to her lips, pressing them together lightly before slipping the tube into the pocket of her riding pants.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The pants were terribly tight, and Agatha knew it. It wasn’t carelessness. It was intention. Looks appeared even without her seeking them, and the final detail completed the picture: small rhinestones forming a rabbit exactly where her tattoo was hidden beneath the fabric.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She went down the stairs with determined steps, crossed the doors, and stepped outside, taking a deep breath. She didn’t have to walk far to find the stables and the large riding arena. The smell of earth, hay, and leather mixed with the fresh morning air. Agatha approached Professor Peggy, who was talking with other students, and received an attentive smile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Harkness, it’s good to see you here. I hope you didn’t come to pull any of your pranks."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I’m at peace today," Agatha replied, smiling in a way that wasn’t entirely convincing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"How can I help?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I’d like to take the weekend classes."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh, that’s great. Do you have any experience with horseback riding?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh, yes. I took a few classes at the Los Angeles Country Club during vacation."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Great then," Peggy said, handing her a form. "Fill this out."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha began to write, and that was when, in the distance, she noticed a black car approaching slowly. She recognized it immediately: the car Rio drove. And of course, it must have been Natasha’s — she was the Alpha Council President, after all. It made sense. Poor thing, being her best friend’s driver.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Here, professor," Agatha said, handing the form back.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Alright. Now go to the stables and choose a horse."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha nodded, the smile still present, and headed toward the stables.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha walked toward the stables with confident steps, observing the horses lined up — too big, too noble for a school full of small rules.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She scanned a few without much interest until she stopped in front of a white horse, tall, muscular, with a blond mane falling to the side as if deliberately careless. He looked back at her, calm, attentive. The name on the stall made Agatha raise an eyebrow.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Skull.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Of course your name is Skull," she murmured, half-smiling.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The saddle was already on him. Great. One less thing to argue about with someone. Agatha opened her bag and pulled out her own riding helmet, elegant, far too expensive for that place.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She had no intention of using the school’s helmets, and even less of trusting her skull to communal equipment. A head injury was definitely not part of the plan.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She mounted easily, a fluid, automatic movement, like someone who had done it many times before. Skull didn’t even flinch, just adjusted his weight, obedient. Agatha guided the horse out of the stable and toward the arena. A few alphas were already gathering around, watching with curiosity that was far too open.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>That was when she saw Rio.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio was standing a few meters ahead, eyes fixed on the horse, as if she sensed something wrong. She took a step forward and shouted loudly enough to echo.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha heard it. Of course she did. And completely ignored it.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She pressed her legs lightly, and Skull responded immediately. The horse took off with controlled force, elegant, entering the circuit as if he had been made for it. Rio froze where she was, stunned, as if she couldn’t believe what was happening right in front of her eyes.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha ran the circuit flawlessly. Firm posture, steady hands, eyes forward. Skull jumped, turned, accelerated with almost irritating precision. At the end of the lap, Professor Peggy applauded without holding back her enthusiasm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Some students whistled. Rio brought a hand to her mouth, trying to contain a smile that escaped despite herself, and then entered the stable, shaking her head like someone who had just lost an internal bet.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>After a few more laps, Agatha slowed down, smiling, far too pleased with herself. She led Skull back to the stable and dismounted lightly. That was when she saw Rio crouched on the ground, focused, polishing her own boots with precise movements. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh, thank God you’re here," Agatha said, getting off the horse. "My boots are terrible. You need to be more punctual." Rio lifted her face slowly, an amused smile appearing at the corner of her mouth, as if that audacity were… interesting.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Of course," she replied, grabbing more polish while Agatha rested her foot on the stand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And how did you get on that horse?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well," Agatha said, shrugging. "Climbing. He’s a sweetheart." Rio let out a low, disbelieving laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "You didn’t read his name?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I did. Skull. Very tacky."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well," Rio replied, carefully polishing Agatha’s boots, "he doesn’t accept almost anyone except his owner."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha raised her eyebrow slightly, watching Rio’s movements, feeling the firm, professional touch — almost too intimate for something so simple. When Rio finished, she stood up, and only then did Agatha realize how tall she was. The closeness changed everything for a second.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"There," Rio said, wiping her hands. "Clean boots, princess."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The word hit Agatha squarely, somewhere she hadn’t expected.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Only my father calls me that," she said, trying to keep control of her voice.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her head, stepped a little closer, and touched one of Agatha’s blond curls, wrapping it around her fingers and then letting it go, as if crushing something fragile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What a shame," she murmured. "I think I will too."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha twisted her mouth slightly, trying to hide the smile that insisted on appearing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I have to go," she said, stepping back. "Nice work with the boots."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"My pleasure," Rio replied, already turning to take Skull back to the stall.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I’ll always be here to clean your boots… princess."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She winked lightly before walking away.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha left completely unsettled, her heart racing far too much for someone who had been absolutely certain she was in control. And for the first time since she had arrived at that place, she wasn’t so sure anymore.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha reached the cafeteria still carrying the smell of hay and leather on her clothes, her body warm from exercise, but her mind far too distant to notice any detail around her. The long tables were already partially occupied, the metallic clatter of cutlery mixing with lazy Saturday conversations.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She crossed the hall almost on autopilot until she spotted Wanda, Jen, and Alice sitting together, as always, occupying the same improvised territory of safety.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Good morning," Wanda said as soon as she saw her approaching.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha sat down slowly, resting her elbows on the table, her gaze lost on some nonexistent point ahead. Her expression wasn’t victory, nor excitement. It was confusion. Disarray. As if something had gone off-script. Wanda narrowed her eyes immediately.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What is it, Agatha?" Agatha blinked a few times, as if organizing her thoughts before speaking.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I think…" she began, stopping mid-sentence, "…that I underestimated Vidal." Jen lifted her head instantly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Underestimated how?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"She’s a piece of work," Agatha finished, finally looking at the three of them. Wanda let out a short, incredulous laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Agatha, don’t tell me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No, seriously," she insisted, running a hand through her hair. "Face it, Wanda. She’s not just…" she made a vague gesture with her hand, "a flirt. There’s something there. But it’s fine. It’s all within the plan."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The sentence came out too fast, too defensive for someone who claimed to be in control. Alice watched in silence for a few seconds, then looked at Jen, exchanging one of those looks full of meaning, like someone who didn’t entirely buy that sudden confidence. Jen tilted her head, evaluating Agatha as if trying to see beneath the pose.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Is everything really fine… or ‘fine’ Agatha Harkness–style?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again. She grabbed a piece of bread from her plate without noticing and broke it in half with her fingers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s just…" she took a deep breath, "she didn’t react the way I expected. She didn’t get nervous, or impressed. Just… amused."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That wasn’t in the script, was it?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No," Agatha admitted, annoyed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"But it doesn’t change anything. The plan continues." Alice crossed her arms.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Just remember the plan is for you to get caught. Not to lose control."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha looked up immediately, offended in just the right measure.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I don’t lose control." The silence that followed was short but heavy. Wanda cleared her throat, breaking the tension.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Alright. Then we stick to the schedule. Party Saturday night. Costume. Rio present. Mrs. Wu furious. Melina losing it. Glorious expulsion." Agatha nodded slowly, trying to convince herself as much as the others.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "Exactly."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>But as she chewed the bread without any appetite, one image insisted on returning:</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio kneeling, firm hands on the boots, the crooked smile… and the word princess, spoken too softly to be just a tease. Alice noticed before the others.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Agatha…" she called carefully. "You’re still in control, right?" Agatha lifted her chin automatically.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Always."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>That was something else entirely.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha froze, her eyes scanning the racks filled with heavy fabrics, questionable prints, outdated cuts, and pieces that looked like they had come straight out of the last century… or out of the closet of a very resentful great-aunt.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Meanwhile, the rest of the group was having the time of their lives, like kids in an amusement park. Wanda put on a dress that clearly matched absolutely nothing. Alice tried on a massive coat that made her look like a detective from an old movie. Jen was holding a tweed skirt with completely unjustified pride.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Guys," Jen said seriously, lifting a wrinkled piece. "This is important. What do you think, Agatha? Fifty cents." </span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha looked at the garment as if she were being personally challenged.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It looks like funeral clothing," she replied without hesitation. "I’d rather keep the Yorkshire right here," she added, pointing at the horrible dog sweatshirt. Wanda approached, smiling.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’re Buddhist, right? Just pretend this is a reincarnation of clothes." Agatha crossed her arms.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Girl, not even Buddha would have the courage to be seen wearing these," she paused, took a deep breath, "but… this is easy for us."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She tied her hair into a high bun, decisively took off the dog sweatshirt, and folded it before tossing it into a corner, like she was stepping into a war mission.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Let’s get to work."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They began to scour the store as if they had just received official permission to commit aesthetic crimes. Rack by rack, corner by corner, pulling rusty hangers, lifting skirts that were far too heavy, coats that smelled like mothballs, and fabrics that creaked just from being touched. The thrift store looked small from the outside, but inside it was a chaotic maze of different eras, decades stacked together without any shame.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This definitely killed someone," Jen commented, holding up a black dress that was far too long, with absurd shoulder pads.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No, this killed fashion," Wanda replied, placing a crooked hat on her head and striking a dramatic pose. "Look at me, I’m a rich widow from 1940."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice burst out laughing, holding a faux-fur coat that looked like a poorly resolved carpet.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"If Melina shows up now, she’ll have a heart attack."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha watched everything with a mix of horror and creative excitement. Her eyes didn’t see old clothes — they saw raw material. She started pulling fabrics with intent, running her fingers over them, feeling the weight, the drape, the texture. Within minutes, she had already built a pile in her arms.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Wait…" she murmured. "This has potential."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This looks like a curtain," Jen said suspiciously.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"French curtain," Agatha corrected, already folding the piece a different way. "It all depends on who’s in charge of the fabric."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She started doing what she did best: magic. She folded hems, twisted sleeves, tied fabrics with strategic knots, pinned things together with improvised pins. A shapeless dress became a strapless gown with a slit. An old coat turned into a dramatic cape. A forgotten scarf became a cinematic detail.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"My God…" Wanda murmured, looking at herself in an improvised mirror. "I’m… hot?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You always were," Agatha replied without looking up. "I just revealed it." Alice appeared wearing something that had seemed impossible minutes earlier: elegant, mysterious, with a discreet sensuality that had never existed in the original piece.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This is so wrong," she said, spinning. "Wrong in a good way."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha moved on to herself. She picked a dress that was far too plain, almost boring, mentally cut invisible lines, tied it in the back, adjusted the waist, pulled the neckline down just right. The fabric fell as if it had been made for her. Effortlessly sexy. Pure cinema.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She stared at herself in the mirror for a few seconds, silent.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This is too much," she finally said. "Seriously." The three gathered around, judging the result like reality show judges.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Too much like ‘this will cause trouble’?" Jen asked.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Too much like," Agatha smirked, "if someone said this was designer, added three zeros to the price tag… I’d buy it without thinking twice."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The group burst into laughter, excitement rising, complicity sealing itself like a silent pact.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>After the shopping, bags full and laughter still lingering, they walked to the hair salon on a narrow street in York, with an old façade and a small window that was always busy. It was one of those places that seemed to exist outside of time, constantly smelling like expensive shampoo mixed with stale coffee and hairspray. As soon as they pushed the door open and stepped inside, the sound of blow dryers stopped with a single, immediate reaction.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Holy God."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The hairdresser lifted his eyes over his glasses straight at Alice, staring at her eyebrows like they were a crime against humanity.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Holy God indeed."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice crossed her arms, offended and desperate in equal measure.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Why don’t you say it louder?" she said. "I need your help!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda and Jen immediately started laughing while Alice dropped into the nearest chair, resigned. Agatha watched with her arms crossed until she finally sat in one of the empty chairs, spinning slightly as if she were assessing the place.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The hairdresser turned to her — and widened his eyes again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Holy God," he said, pausing dramatically. "Your hair is… screaming."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yeah," Agatha replied without any surprise. "I know."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She settled into the chair and started talking with her hands, like she was presenting a project.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I want something elegant, but not like I tried too hard. Sexy, but effortless. Nothing overly uptight British, nothing obviously American."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The hairdresser let out a short chuckle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Sweetheart, I’m going to be honest with you," he said, already running his fingers through her hair. "I’ll tell you what can be done."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>He began listing options, one after another. Cuts that were too precise. Blondes that were too artificial. Things that screamed ‘expensive salon’ with no soul. Agatha made face after face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I hate it."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No."</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "Awful."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That’s rich stepmother hair." He stopped, then parted her hair at the roots, studying it carefully. He frowned slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Interesting…" </span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What?" Agatha asked, suspicious.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’ve got brown strands here. You’re not a natural blonde." "No," she replied. "Never was."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>He smiled, satisfied.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Then we can do something much better. A more natural look… keeping the blonde. Something that actually looks like you. Not a manufactured version."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Go on." Time passed without her noticing. Scissors, brushes, sinks. Alice complaining about her eyebrows. Jen secretly checking her phone. Wanda commenting on clothes. And in the middle of it all, Agatha’s hair being transformed with calm, precision, and respect.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>When he finished, he slowly turned the chair toward the mirror.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The reflection showed something different.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her hair was now a darker blonde leaning into brown — her natural shade, deep and warm — cut with soft blonde highlights, blended organically, as if the sun had done it over years, not hours. Nothing screamed for attention. She leaned a little closer to the mirror, silent.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda was the first to speak.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’re beautiful."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Truly beautiful," Jen added. Alice tilted her head, sincere.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It looks… like you." Agatha swallowed, her eyes still fixed on the reflection.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I look… exactly like my mother." The salon fell silent for a second. Alice blinked.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And she… was she beautiful too?" Agatha smiled softly, a small smile, heavy with memory.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Very." Alice immediately made a face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "Sorry. I say stupid things." Agatha turned her head, meeting her gaze.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s okay."</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify"><span>They left the salon still talking, the bell on the door chiming behind them as the afternoon began to give way to early evening. The air was colder now, but there was something light in the atmosphere — maybe the combined effect of new hair, new clothes, and the dangerous feeling that everything was exactly where it should be. Agatha walked in the middle of the group, touching her hair now and then as if she were still recognizing herself in that newly discovered reflection.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Okay…" she said at last. "Where’s the pub?" Wanda pointed down the street without much drama.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Just keep going downhill. You can’t miss it. York basically pushes you toward it."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I love cooperative cities," Agatha replied, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They walked down the narrow streets, laughing, talking about the salon, about Alice’s hair, about how Jen looked strangely elegant that day. The uneven stones reflected the light of old lampposts, and the distant sound of music and voices began to drift through the air, mixed with the smell of beer and hot food.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The pub appeared just as promised: dark wooden façade, small windows, yellow light spilling out. As soon as they stepped inside, the place swallowed them. It was busy but not packed — wooden tables, a long bar, music playing low enough not to be annoying. Some students were already there, drinks in hand, laughter a little too loose for people who were supposed to behave.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Just to be clear," Wanda said, scanning the room, "getting drunk is definitely forbidden." Agatha raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "I’m not promising anything."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’re terrible," Jen commented, shaking her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I’m honest," Agatha corrected.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They sat at a table near the bar, ordered a few drinks — nothing fancy, just enough to warm up — and raised their glasses almost in unison.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"To the plan," Alice said.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"To Operation Freedom," Wanda added.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And to a glorious expulsion," Agatha finished, clinking her glass.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The glasses touched, the liquid swayed, and for a few minutes they just existed there: laughing, sipping slowly, watching the pub fill as night fully settled. The music got a little louder, conversations looser.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>That was when the door opened again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A few alphas walked in, drawing almost automatic attention. Among them, Rio — smiling, relaxed, walking beside Natasha as if that were exactly where she belonged. Rio’s laughter was easy, open, and Agatha felt the immediate shift in the room, as if the air itself had changed density.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Without saying a word, Agatha exchanged a knowing look with Wanda. One of those looks that needed no explanation. Wanda simply nodded, a brief smile forming at the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha stood up.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She was no longer wearing the silly sweater, which helped a lot. Now she wore a miniskirt and a white tank top, too simple to look planned, too dangerous to be ignored. She walked to the bar with practiced ease, ordered another drink, rested her elbow, and waited.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio approached a few seconds later.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well," she said, smiling, "new hair." Agatha turned with the drink in hand, her expression carefully rehearsed indifference.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yeah." Rio tilted her head, looking closer.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It looks great. I mean… you look beautiful."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Thanks," Agatha replied, taking a sip. "So they gave you the night off from boot cleaning?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A few of Rio’s friends let out quiet laughs nearby. Rio simply leaned against the bar, relaxed, her smile shifting into something else.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well, princess…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"So they let you girls out?" Rio asked, resting her elbow on the bar, her drink forgotten in her hand, her gaze far too attentive for someone pretending to be casual.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, studying her over the rim of her glass, a crooked smile forming.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"They let us?" she repeated mockingly. "You know we’re not in a convent, right?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Sometimes it feels like it."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That’s because you walk around looking like someone who enjoys rules," Agatha replied, turning her body a little more toward her, invading her personal space without asking. "But don’t worry, today I got divine permission to drink."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Divine permission…" Rio repeated, amused. "From Mrs. Wu?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No." Agatha leaned closer, lowering her voice. "From myself."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly entertained, but there was something in her eyes — a specific spark — that showed this provocation didn’t pass unnoticed. Agatha noticed. And made a point of continuing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Are you always this quiet in pubs?" Agatha asked. "Or only when there’s an audience?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I’m quiet when it’s worth it," Rio replied calmly. "And I talk when it’s worth even more."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Brave," Agatha said, taking a slow sip. "But you know this is a public place, right? If someone sees you flirting with a problematic omega…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Flirting?" Rio interrupted, feigning surprise. "I thought you were interrogating me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh, I do both," Agatha replied. "Depends on my mood."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio laughed again, this time more openly, tilting her head to the side.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You like provoking people."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I like seeing how much someone can take," Agatha corrected. "In your case…" she paused deliberately, "you handle it well." Rio took a slow breath, as if steadying herself against something too small to admit, but too big to ignore.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You talk like you’re sure of that."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I am," Agatha replied simply. "You could’ve walked away five minutes ago."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio looked at her glass, then at Agatha, and smiled in that unapologetic way.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "Maybe I like it when you try to put me in an uncomfortable position."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tilted her head, surprised just enough to be interesting.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Try?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio stepped closer now, her shoulder almost brushing Agatha’s.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You tease me, provoke me, call me a boot cleaner…" she said softly. "It’s almost public humiliation."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well, that’s what you are, isn’t it? You cleaned my boots very well," Agatha corrected, smiling. The silence between them thickened for a second. Agatha felt her stomach give that subtle drop. This wasn’t an easy fall.  It was a mirror game.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Careful," Agatha said, setting her glass down on the counter. "If you keep this up, someone might think you’re starting to like me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And you?" Rio asked. "Do you like me?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha smiled slowly, dangerously.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "I like causing trouble."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Then we’re aligned," Rio replied. "I like surviving it."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Were you in that bathtub?" Agatha asked, tossing a strand of hair back with false nonchalance, as if her body weren’t reacting far too much to the closeness.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her head, her smile slow and deliberate.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "Who knows…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Funny," Agatha shot back. "You said my full name."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I like being informed about the things that interest me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow theatrically, leaning a little closer.</span><span><br/>
</span><span> "So I got your attention?" she asked, blinking with an innocence that fooled no one.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s not very hard," Rio replied, far too calm. "Actually, you caught everyone’s attention."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I did?" Agatha teased, as if genuinely surprised.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she stepped forward.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The distance between them closed too quickly to ignore.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You’ve been the most interesting thing here in years," Rio whispered directly into Agatha’s ear.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The low tone made Agatha’s skin prickle. They didn’t even notice when their positions shifted completely. Agatha was now pressed against the bar, her glass forgotten beside her, while Rio stood in front of her, both hands braced on the counter, one on each side of Agatha’s body, almost trapping her there with her presence. She wasn’t actually touching her, but she was close enough that every breath was shared.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The entire bar seemed to disappear.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her face and lightly brushed her nose along Agatha’s neck, a slow, deliberate gesture, far too intimate to be accidental. Agatha turned her head, her eyes locking onto Rio’s with predatory intensity, as if measuring how far she could go—or how much longer she could hold herself back.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Then the world crashed back violently.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A loud noise exploded near the door. Chairs scraped. A glass shattered. The music was cut off abruptly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"The police are rounding up students who stayed past curfew!" someone shouted, running into the pub.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Chaos erupted instantly. People stood up all at once, voices overlapping, chairs banging. Across the room, Wanda jumped to her feet, her face pale.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Shit!" she called, searching for Agatha. "Agatha!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tried to move, her body reacting instinctively to flee—but it was too late. The pub doors opened again, this time with authority. Police officers began filing in, spreading through the room.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Hey!" someone yelled. "ID!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha’s heart slammed against her ribs. She took a step sideways and then felt a firm hand yank her back.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Without saying a word, Rio grabbed Agatha by the wrist and pulled her behind the bar in one swift, decisive movement. The space was tight, dark, smelling of alcohol and old wood. Rio instinctively positioned herself in front of Agatha, her body forming a shield, her hand still firm on Agatha’s arm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Stay quiet," she murmured, so low only Agatha could hear. "Trust me."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha swallowed hard, her body far too close to Rio’s to think straight. Boots echoed on the other side, voices demanding explanations, glasses being hurriedly collected. For a second, all Agatha could feel was Rio’s body heat, her breath far too close, her grip far too steady for someone who was supposed to be distant.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They were running through the back of the pub now, disorganized and fast, the ground uneven and damp, smelling of old beer and trash. Agatha kept glancing back, her heart racing not only from the escape, but from the worry pounding in her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"The girls…" she said breathlessly. "Wanda, Jen, Alice…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"They can handle themselves," Rio replied without slowing, pulling Agatha by the hand. "Now move."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>That was when the heel betrayed her. Agatha’s foot twisted sharply, dry and sudden, and her body pitched forward.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Fuck!" The curse came out loud, echoing in the alley. "Shit!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The groan followed immediately, involuntary and sharp with pain. Agatha doubled over at once, clutching her ankle, her eyes burning. Rio stopped instantly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>In the distance, flashlights sliced through the darkness, white beams sweeping walls and ground. Voices. Fast footsteps. They were too close.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn’t think. She simply crouched, slid one arm behind Agatha’s knees, the other around her back, grabbed the heel still hanging from her foot, and lifted her off the ground like she weighed nothing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Hey!" Agatha exclaimed, startled.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Stay quiet," Rio said, already running.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha instinctively wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck, her heart pounding, her body bouncing with every stride. Over Rio’s shoulder, she could see the flashlights closing in, the confused movement behind them. The wind hit her face, cold, as Rio turned sharply into a narrow alley, cut through it, and emerged on the other side—where the space suddenly opened up.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>An open field.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>And parked there, as if it had been waiting for them, the black convertible.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Fuck…" Rio breathed, still holding Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She crossed the field in long strides and stopped beside the car. With unexpected gentleness for someone who had just run like that, she set Agatha down on the hood, slowly, as if afraid of hurting her more.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Are you badly hurt?" she asked, her breathing still uneven.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Um… I don’t know," Agatha replied, biting her lip.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio knelt in front of her, resting one knee on the ground. She carefully removed the heel and touched the ankle, already swelling. Agatha hissed in pain immediately.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I think it’s sprained," Rio said seriously, already assessing it. "I’m taking you back to the school." Agatha took a deep breath, trying to process everything.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "Don’t we have to wait for Natasha?" Rio raised an eyebrow, confused.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Why would we wait for Natasha?" Agatha tilted her chin toward the car.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Isn’t this her car?" Rio smiled—a quick, almost amused smile.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "No. The car’s mine."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh…" Agatha blinked, absorbing the information. "Okay."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come on," Rio said, extending her hand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She helped Agatha down from the hood and held her steady when she tried to put weight on her foot.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Can you step on it?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tried. The moment her foot touched the ground, pain shot up like electricity.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No," she groaned, frustrated.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn’t argue. She picked her up again, carried her the few steps to the car, and set her in the passenger seat with the same careful precision, adjusting her leg.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It’s going to be a problem when you don’t come back on the bus," Rio commented, closing the door. Agatha smirked, watching Rio walk around the vehicle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I thought you liked trouble."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio opened the driver’s door, got in, and started the engine.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I do," she said, glancing at Agatha before pulling away. "But I don’t want trouble for you."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha shrugged, far too relaxed for someone with a throbbing ankle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Good thing I don’t mind."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio let out a low laugh, shaking her head as she drove. Agatha looked around, trying to get her bearings, and then noticed the rearview mirror. A car was following them, keeping a steady distance.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"There’s a guy following us," she said, frowning.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I know," Rio replied calmly. "He’s my security."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Security?" Agatha turned toward her. "Why?" Rio sighed, like someone already tired of that explanation.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"My brother. He insists."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And is your brother some very rich mobster?" Agatha teased. Rio smiled faintly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Almost."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Well… then you must have a gun, if that’s true." Rio shot her a quick, amused look.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Unfortunately, my weapons kit stayed at home."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha laughed softly, resting her head against the seat as the car rolled through the dark road.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio slowed as they approached the school, circling the grounds until she stopped beside the building assigned to the omegas. The structure was older, lit by only a few exterior lights, contrasting with the night’s silence—a silence that clearly didn’t exist inside. As soon as the car stopped, agitated voices could already be heard through open windows.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Are you okay?" Rio asked, turning off the engine and looking at Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Can you move your foot?" Agatha shifted in the seat, took a deep breath, and grimaced.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I think it’s swollen," she said. "And it’s throbbing, which is never a good sign."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio nodded and got out of the car immediately. She opened the passenger door and, before Agatha could even protest, lifted her up again, firm and careful, as if it were already becoming a dangerously natural habit.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Hey, I can—"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"No," Rio cut her off. "You groaned just trying to get down earlier."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha huffed but wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck anyway, leaning into her without arguing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Inside the building, the common area was controlled chaos. Girls were talking all at once, some sitting on couches, others pacing back and forth. The name Agatha Harkness floated through whispers, questions, half-formed theories.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"She didn’t come back."</span></p><p align="justify"><span> "She disappeared."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I told you this would cause trouble."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Sue’s going to lose it—"As if summoned by collective desperation, Inspector Sue appeared in the hallway the exact moment Rio reached the door.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Harkness!" The voice echoed before she even fully took in the scene. "Where were you?!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"She’s injured," Rio said before Agatha could speak. "She twisted her ankle. I brought her back."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue narrowed her eyes, assessing the situation quickly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Put her down." Rio obeyed, but the moment Agatha tried to put weight on her foot, the cry slipped out too loud, cutting the air.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Ah—!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue grimaced instantly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Holy God…" she muttered. "Get inside and take her to the infirmary. And get out of here, Vidal!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yes, ma’am," Rio replied flatly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She carried Agatha inside, but any attempt at discretion died instantly. All the students were there. Heads turned at once. Whispers spread like dry grass catching fire.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha, supported in Rio’s arms, scanned the room—and was absolutely certain she saw Melina on the other side. Her glare looked capable of setting walls on fire. Too satisfied to miss the opportunity, Agatha tightened her arms slightly around Rio’s neck and offered a slow, provocative smile directly at her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Melina nearly exploded.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"AGATHA!" Wanda was the first to react, followed by Jen and Alice, who stood up together. "Where were you? What happened?!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Order!" Sue shouted. "Everyone to the infirmary, now!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The group moved, still murmuring, down the narrow hallway to the small infirmary. Rio entered carefully and laid Agatha onto the bed, slowly, making sure her injured foot was elevated.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Slow," she murmured, more to herself than to Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Sue pointed to the door as soon as Rio stepped away from the bed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You can leave now, Vidal." Rio hesitated.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Maybe it’s better if I—"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Leave, Vidal," Sue repeated impatiently.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio closed her mouth, nodded once, and turned away. Before exiting, however, she exchanged a quick look with Agatha—too brief to be noticed by anyone not looking for it, too intense to be neutral. Agatha held her gaze, a half-smile on her lips, as if to say it’s not over. Rio left. The door closed behind her.</span></p><p align="justify"> </p>

Her right leg lay stretched out on pillows, wrapped in a white splint that she had, of course, insisted on decorating. There were doodles in colorful pen, little stars, crooked signatures from the girls, and even an overly dramatic heart near her ankle. Even immobilized, the splint screamed Agatha Harkness.</p><p align="justify">"Good morning…" Agatha replied, letting out a sigh heavy with bad mood, her eyes still heavy, her loose hair falling over her face.</p><p align="justify">Wanda set the tray down on the desk and gave a quick, assessing look, from the food to her friend’s expression.</p><p align="justify">"I can already tell the day started worse than yesterday."</p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her gaze toward the window, where the gray sky stubbornly existed, as if the world were conspiring against her.</p><p align="justify">"Being stuck here doesn’t help the plan at all, Wanda."</p><p align="justify">There was real frustration in her voice. It wasn’t just boredom. It was the feeling of being frozen while everything went on without her.</p><p align="justify">"I know," Wanda replied calmly, sitting on the edge of the bed. "But the doctor said you can take the splint off on Friday."</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a dry laugh, completely humorless.</p><p align="justify">"A whole week without being able to act on the main plan. Great. Perfect. Brilliant."</p><p align="justify">She gestured with her hands as if presenting her own failure on an imaginary stage. Wanda gave a small smile, the kind that mixed patience and irony, because she knew that drama by heart.</p><p align="justify">"You’re really silly sometimes."</p><p align="justify">Agatha snapped her head around immediately, offended on reflex.</p><p align="justify">"Hey—"</p><p align="justify">"Listen," Wanda continued, cutting her off. "You forgot an important detail." Agatha raised an eyebrow, suspicious.</p><p align="justify">"What?"</p><p align="justify">Wanda tilted her head slightly, a smile beginning to form.</p><p align="justify">"You arrived in her arms, Agatha. In front of the entire school."</p><p align="justify">Silence fell heavily for a second.</p><p align="justify">Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but closed it. The image came back in full: the hallway, the stares, the weight of Rio’s body holding hers, the firm way she carried her, the involuntary care.</p><p align="justify">"…okay," she muttered, annoyed.</p><p align="justify">"That’s not a small thing," Wanda continued. "Melina saw it. Sue saw it. The omegas saw it. The alphas saw it. And, most importantly… she felt it."</p><p align="justify">"Alright," Wanda said at last, crossing her arms. "So let’s think properly."</p><p align="justify">Agatha lifted her eyes, interested despite herself.</p><p align="justify">"Think like someone playing chess, not like someone flipping the board," Wanda went on. "You’re stuck here, yes. But that doesn’t mean you disappeared."</p><p align="justify">"I literally disappeared from the riding field, the pub, and now the entire school," Agatha snapped irritably. "I’m a hallway rumor with a cast."</p><p align="justify">Wanda smirked.</p><p align="justify">"You’re a dramatic rumor. You showed up carried in someone’s arms, a twisted ankle, Sue yelling, Melina foaming at the mouth. That creates narrative."</p><p align="justify">Agatha made a face, but didn’t disagree.</p><p align="justify">"Rio likes provocation," Wanda continued, pacing the room. "But more than that… she likes chaos. You didn’t implode, you slipped. Literally. That humanizes you."</p><p align="justify">"I don’t want to be human," Agatha muttered. "I want to be irresistible."</p><p align="justify">"And who said you can’t be both?" Wanda stopped in front of her. "Do you think she picked you up just out of politeness? She could have left you in the alley, or called the police. Or told you to walk."</p><p align="justify">"But she didn’t," Wanda said firmly. "She carried you. She protected you. She brought you back here. And she even got scolded for it."</p><p align="justify">Agatha bit her lip, clearly annoyed by the conclusion.</p><p align="justify">"I can’t flirt on crutches."</p><p align="justify">"No," Wanda agreed. "But you can provoke in other ways."</p><p align="justify">She leaned over, picked up one of the pens lying on the bed, and twirled it between her fingers.</p><p align="justify">"Indirect messages. Sustained looks. Side comments. Strategic vulnerability."</p><p align="justify">"I hate that word," Agatha grumbled.</p><p align="justify">"I know. That’s why it works," Wanda replied. "Rio won’t be able to pretend you don’t exist while you’re there, stationary, watching, being… quietly inconvenient."</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a short laugh despite herself.</p><p align="justify">"You’re scary when you think."</p><p align="justify">"And you’re dangerous when you stop running," Wanda shot back. "Use that."</p><p align="justify">She nudged the tray toward Agatha.</p><p align="justify">"Eat. Look pretty. Rest. Friday you take off that splint… and Saturday night you dance."</p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her leg, then at Wanda, then at the window where the day was starting to brighten.</p><p align="justify">"And if I fail?"</p><p align="justify">Wanda shrugged, far too calm.</p><p align="justify">"Then you’ll have to stay here a few weeks. But honestly?" She leaned in again, smiling. "She’s already fallen a little. She just hasn’t noticed yet."</p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath, leaned back against the headboard, and finally picked up the coffee cup.</p><p align="justify">"Alright," she said, a dangerous half-smile forming. "Then let’s let her think she’s in control."</p><p align="justify">Wanda laughed.</p><p align="justify">"Yesterday something funny happened," Agatha said, peeling an orange with excessive care, as if that were the only thing under control in the universe at that moment. She pulled the peel off in long strips, tossing them onto the small plate, the citrus smell filling the stuffy room.</p><p align="justify">"What?" Wanda asked, sitting on the floor, focused on cleaning one of her shoes with an old cloth.</p><p align="justify">"When Rio was bringing me back…" Agatha paused dramatically, separating a segment of fruit. "There was a guy following us. A bodyguard, I think. It was weird."</p><p align="justify">Wanda kept rubbing the shoe for one second longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify">"And why would that be?"</p><p align="justify">"I don’t know," Agatha shrugged, laughing lightly. "She’s a mob boss now? Maybe she’s involved in boot-polish trafficking. Or illegal horses."</p><p align="justify">She laughed at her own joke, popping a segment into her mouth. Wanda stopped. Literally stopped. The cloth froze midair. The shoe dropped to the floor.</p><p align="justify">"Agatha…" she said slowly. "You’re joking, right?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha chewed, swallowed, and frowned.</p><p align="justify">"What?" she asked, confused. "Did I say something wrong?"</p><p align="justify">Without answering, Wanda stood up abruptly and walked to the desk. She opened a drawer, rummaged through a few things, and pulled out a folded magazine. She came back and opened it directly to a specific page, holding it out in front of Agatha.</p><p align="justify">"Do you know who this is?" she asked, pointing at the name printed in elegant letters.</p><p align="justify">“Benito Antonio Vidal Ocasio”</p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, reading.</p><p align="justify">"Oh…" she paused. "No?"</p><p align="justify">Wanda took a deep breath, like someone preparing to explain something painfully obvious.</p><p align="justify">"Agatha. He’s the heir to the English throne. The direct heir."</p><p align="justify">"…okay," Agatha replied slowly. "So?"</p><p align="justify">Wanda’s eyes widened, completely incredulous. Without saying a word, she flipped the magazine page.</p><p align="justify">There was another photo. Another full article. Another name.</p><p align="justify">“Rihannon Vidal Ocasio”</p><p align="justify">Rio.</p><p align="justify">The photo showed her impeccable, serious expression, perfect posture. The headline took up half the page. It talked about the second daughter of King Augustus, the Duchess of York, official appearances, diplomatic events, titles, lineage.</p><p align="justify">Agatha sat up properly in bed now, taking the magazine from Wanda’s hands with strange care, as if it might bite.</p><p align="right"><em>She read.</em></p><p align="right"><em>Reread.</em></p><p align="right"><em>Blink.</em></p><p align="right"><em>Read again.</em></p><p align="justify">"Wanda…" she said slowly, without taking her eyes off the page.</p><p align="justify">"Yes?" Wanda replied, arms crossed, waiting for the impact. Agatha lifted her head, eyes wide with something almost reverent.</p><p align="justify">"…I made the Princess of England clean my boots."</p><p align="justify">"And she still called me princess."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah," Wanda smiled. "Unintentional irony is usually the most dangerous kind."</p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the magazine slowly and stared out the window, her brain clearly recalculating her entire existence.</p><p align="justify">"…that explains the bodyguard."</p><p align="justify">"It explains a lot," Wanda agreed. "Including why Sue almost had a stroke when she saw you in her arms."</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a nervous laugh, still half in shock.</p><p align="justify">"Wanda?"</p><p align="justify">"Yeah."</p><p align="justify">"I think the plan just got…" she searched for the right word. "More complicated."</p><p align="justify">Wanda tilted her head, smiling like someone watching a beautiful fire.</p><p align="justify">"Or much better."</p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify">Agatha stayed there for a few seconds after the revelation, her heart racing too fast. After a few more internal meltdowns—all dramatic—she decided she wasn’t going to spend the rest of the day staring at walls. Even on crutches, even defying Sue, even defying common sense, she left the room.</p><p align="justify">The walk to the stables was slow, punctuated by deep breaths and small curses muttered between steps. When she arrived, she chose a wooden bench and sat down, watching in silence.</p><p align="justify">Rio was on the track.</p><p align="justify">She guided the white horse with precision, her body aligned, movements clean, almost too elegant to feel real. The same horse Agatha had ridden days before. The same course. The same focus. When she finished, Rio slowed down, dismounted easily, and only then noticed her.</p><p align="justify">Rio walked toward her smiling, helmet still in hand.</p><p align="justify">"Hey… so?" she asked, stopping a few steps away. "How did you escape the room?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed theatrically and stood with the help of her crutches.</p><p align="justify">"I have my tricks."</p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, watching her closely. The protective pheromone was there—strong, almost tangible. Agatha noticed. Registered it. Chose not to comment.</p><p align="justify">"So…" Agatha continued, adjusting her stance. "When were you going to tell me?"</p><p align="justify">"Tell you what?" Rio asked, genuinely curious.</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, I don’t know… that your brother is the heir to the English throne. That you are, by any chance, the Duchess of York. And a real princess."</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled—a small, almost intimate smile.</p><p align="justify">"I loved the fact that you didn’t even know."</p><p align="justify">"Great," Agatha replied dryly. "Now I just need to decide whether to ask for political asylum at the U.S. embassy or get guillotined."</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed for real this time.</p><p align="justify">"Well… about the guillotine, I can think about it," she said, touching Agatha’s hair again and crushing a curl between her fingers. "But either way, I’m the black sheep of the family. It’s not like I’m a good role model."</p><p align="justify">"I see…" Agatha replied, watching the gestures, the touches, the closeness. "So you’re the terrible Duchess of York who likes to play doctor, cause scandals, and drive the student council insane."</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, not denying it.</p><p align="justify">"Pretty much. I think you’ll enjoy finding out more."</p><p align="justify">Even on crutches, Agatha stepped a little closer.</p><p align="justify">"Oh yeah? Is there a lot?"</p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, her voice low, too close to Agatha’s lips.</p><p align="justify">"Oh… you have no idea."</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, and before she could say anything else, Rio held her waist carefully and guided her into the stable. With slow, calculated movements, Rio pressed Agatha back against a wooden counter and helped her sit. Agatha shifted her weight onto the counter, the crutches resting uselessly to the side for a few seconds. There was something deliciously improper about being there injured, too adult to ask permission, too young to care about the consequences.</p><p align="justify">Rio was close. Too close.</p><p align="justify">"Will you be mine?" Agatha asked, her voice low and provocative, as if she didn’t need the answer to continue. "Just for today?"</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled slowly, that smile that promised nothing and, still, delivered everything.</p><p align="justify">"You like playing as if the world isn’t watching."</p><p align="justify">"Let them talk," Agatha shrugged. "They always do."</p><p align="justify">Rio raised her hand and touched Agatha’s face with calculated care, warm fingers contrasting with the cold stable air. Her thumb slowly traced Agatha’s lower lip, still tasting of gloss—cherry, sugar, insolence.</p><p align="justify">"You do this on purpose," Rio murmured.</p><p align="justify">"I know what people want," Agatha replied.</p><p align="justify">The kiss came without warning, as if it had always been there, just waiting for the right moment. It wasn’t shy—it was firm, slow, intentional. Rio’s lips closed over Agatha’s with clear purpose, tasting the sweetness, the warmth, the immediate response.</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed into her mouth, responding without hesitation, tilting her face to deepen the contact. The kiss gained weight, rhythm; Agatha’s tongue slipped into Rio’s mouth without asking permission, her hands flying to the alpha’s collar, pulling hard as she began to take control of the kiss.</p><p align="justify">Rio held Agatha’s face with both hands now, as if deciding something irreversible. When she pulled back just enough to breathe, she kept her forehead pressed against Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify">"This is going to knock you out of the sky, princess," she said, almost a warning.</p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes bright.</p><p align="justify">"I like falling."</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly before kissing her again—shorter, more intense, like a barely hidden promise. When they finally pulled away, silence returned—heavy, sweet, full of unspoken things.</p><p align="justify">"You’re trouble," Rio said.</p><p align="justify">"I know," Agatha replied. "But you still kissed me."</p><p align="justify">Rio stepped back one pace, her gaze still fixed on her.</p><p align="justify">"And I would do it again."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stayed there, heart racing, a slow smile forming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Saturday finally arrived like a promise fulfilled too late. Agatha woke up to the room in motion, Wanda talking too much, Jen looking for something she was absolutely sure she had lost, Alice sitting on the bed staring at her own reflection as if preparing for a Cannes premiere.</p><p align="justify">The splint had been left behind, literally abandoned in a corner scribbled on, signed, defeated. Her ankle still complained a little, but nothing that could compete with the electricity of that day.</p><p align="justify">The party was already underway when they arrived at the main hall, and that alone said everything. Teachers in over-the-top costumes, trying to hype up an audience that clearly hadn’t asked for it. A teacher dressed as Chaplin slipped on his own fake mustache. A fairy-winged teacher handed out tired smiles. The atmosphere was one of forced cheer, the kind that only works until someone interesting shows up.</p><p align="justify">Omegas and alphas shared the same space, separated only by looks, sharp comments, and unspoken expectations.</p><p align="justify">Even Melina was there.</p><p align="justify">e entered to the theme music from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, dressed as Elizabeth Bennet, her expression proud, posture impeccable, as if she were determined to prove that class alone could save any environment. The problem was that it didn’t. It sank. Conversation wilted. The dance floor thinned out. Boredom settled in hard.</p><p align="justify">It lasted until the door opened again.</p><p align="justify">Agatha entered first.</p><p align="justify">Conversation died for good.</p><p align="justify">She wore a dangerously self-assured version of Marilyn Monroe, a light-colored dress, tight enough to be almost vulgar but provocative enough to be impossible to ignore.</p><p align="justify">Agatha was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, making no effort whatsoever to disguise the reference. The pale dress immediately evoked those eternal cinema scenes—tight enough to draw attention, loose enough to seem natural, as if she hadn’t spent hours thinking about the effect.</p><p align="justify">The room reacted as if someone had turned up the volume on the world.</p><p align="justify">"Wow."</p><p align="justify">"My God."</p><p align="justify">"Since when is that allowed?"</p><p align="justify">And then the music changed.</p><p align="justify">Nothing slow. Nothing restrained. Something agitated, pulsing, far too modern for the teachers’ taste. The collective body responded before thought. The dance floor filled again. Laughter surfaced. Eyes met. The mood shifted its axis.</p><p align="justify">Agatha felt it before she saw it.</p><p align="justify">Rio was there.</p><p align="justify">Not overly costumed—she never was—but with a detail in her outfit that said <em>I tried</em>, and on her, that was more dangerous than any excess. Rio’s gaze met Agatha’s across the room, and for a second everything slowed again. There was no surprise there. There was recognition. Agatha smiled slowly, that smile that didn’t ask for attention, it claimed it. Wanda leaned in and murmured in her ear,</p><p align="justify">"She saw you."</p><p align="justify">"I know," Agatha replied, without taking her eyes off the other side of the room.</p><p align="justify">"There’s still time to run."Agatha stepped forward, onto the dance floor, feeling the sound vibrate in her chest, Rio’s gaze following every movement.</p><p align="justify">"I never run," she said. "I arrive."</p><p align="justify">Melina’s eyes went straight to Agatha the moment she stepped in. There was no surprise—there was immediate recognition. She had been talking to Rio when she noticed the approach, the smile too slow to be casual, too rehearsed to be innocent.</p><p align="justify">"Hi," Agatha said simply, as if she weren’t about to wreck the entire room. Rio turned her head, her smile appearing before she even thought about it.</p><p align="justify">"Hi, trouble." Her eyes traveled over Agatha without shame. "Your hair looks incredible." Agatha smiled, satisfied, but Melina didn’t waste time.</p><p align="justify">"What are you doing?" she snapped, acidic. "This is a themed party, not a gnome-prostitute competition."</p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her body toward her, genuinely interested.</p><p align="justify">"Listen, sweetheart," she said, appraising Melina from head to toe. "You make a lovely Fiona. You just need a Shrek."</p><p align="justify">Before Melina could respond, the music changed. A more upbeat sound took over the room and Agatha broke into a wide smile.</p><p align="justify">"I love this song."</p><p align="justify">Without asking permission, she pulled Rio onto the dance floor. The dance was lively enough to seem harmless, but close enough to say something else. Agatha moved with confidence, letting her body lead, laughing, provoking, touching more than necessary.</p><p align="justify">Melina clenched her teeth and marched to the DJ table, switching the music to something even more frantic, almost chaotic.</p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, tossed her hair back, and let herself be carried by the rhythm, now dancing with more energy, more exaggeration. Wanda and Jen joined in, laughing, following along, creating a small whirlpool in the middle of the floor.</p><p align="justify">Then Agatha stumbled.</p><p align="justify">She fell seated on the floor, laughing too loudly for it to look like an accident.</p><p align="justify">Rio moved immediately, as did a teacher.</p><p align="justify">"Are you okay?" Rio asked, crouching down.</p><p align="justify">"She’s acting drunk," Melina shot. "Take her to bed. Rio can do the honors."</p><p align="justify">"She’s just a little dizzy," Rio said firmly. "She needs air."</p><p align="justify">"Good idea," Wanda agreed far too quickly.</p><p align="justify">Rio held out her hand and helped Agatha up. Melina made a discreet gesture, and two friends began following them, clearly to prevent anything beyond what was allowed. They walked out of the hall, the sound fading behind them.</p><p align="justify">"So," Rio said, serious but not harsh. "Explain yourself, Miss Harkness."</p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, leaning a bit closer than necessary.<br/>"Unfortunately I can’t explain myself, sir," she said, tilting her head. "I’m not quite myself at the moment."<br/>"Alice said to the caterpillar," Alice added from behind, never missing a chance.</p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">"How do you know that?"</p><p align="justify">"I was Alice in a school play," she replied. "Only alphas. It was pretty funny." Agatha stepped closer, the smile slow and dangerous, but Rio raised a hand and gently touched her shoulder.</p><p align="justify">"You drank. You’re not one hundred percent aware."</p><p align="justify">"I know," Agatha said, too honest. "But I already kissed you before."</p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, an involuntary smile slipping out.</p><p align="justify">"You’re terrible."</p><p align="justify">They leaned toward each other—too close to deny, too far to happen—when they were interrupted.</p><p align="justify">"No dating!" one of Melina’s friends warned, too nervous.</p><p align="justify">"Agatha Harkness, inside now," the other added.</p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened, letting out a dramatic sigh.</p><p align="justify">"Dating omegas, Rio Vidal," she said, provocative to the very end. "As you know, it’s against the rules."</p><p align="justify">"I’ll have to go to London, but I’ll be back on the 18th. How about a date?"</p><p align="justify">"Perfect," Agatha said.</p><p align="justify">She gave an exaggerated little wave before being pulled back inside. The two friends exchanged a look, considering whether to tell Melina everything. They decided not to. Because there were limits. And that was definitely one of them.</p><p align="justify">Agatha returned to the hall still smiling, adrenaline low and warm beneath her skin, searching for Wanda among the shadows and colored lights. That was when she saw the scene unfold before her eyes like a perfectly framed film still she didn’t know she needed to watch.</p><p align="justify">In a darker corner, almost hidden by a column and the low fog from the dry-ice machine, Wanda was sitting on another alphas’s lap. The kiss was slow, comfortable, the kind that didn’t need to prove anything to anyone.</p><p align="justify">When Wanda opened her eyes and noticed Agatha’s presence, she separated naturally, without guilt, without hurry. The other girl stood up right after—Natasha—adjusted her clothes, exchanged a knowing smile with Wanda, and said goodbye with one last quick kiss before leaving, disappearing along the side of the hall as if none of it were forbidden, wrong, or worthy of drama.</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised her eyebrows, genuinely impressed.</p><p align="justify">"Well damn… nicely done, Wanda."</p><p align="justify">Wanda smiled, that satisfied look, still a little flushed, crossing her arms calmly.</p><p align="justify">"So?" she asked, tilting her head. "Was Operation Rio successful?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a short, tired chuckle and sat beside her.</p><p align="justify">"Don’t even get me started. Melina didn’t show up. I still depend on those two troglodytes telling her… but honestly? I think it’s very unlikely."</p><p align="justify">Alice appeared out of nowhere, as always, scanning the room with a quick, efficient look. She glanced around, noticed the absence of immediate chaos, and concluded,</p><p align="justify">"They didn’t tell."</p><p align="justify">"I knew it," Agatha replied, satisfied.</p><p align="justify">"We’re going to have to add an addendum to Plan B," Alice said, already thinking a few steps ahead.</p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, resting her head on Wanda’s shoulder for a moment.</p><p align="justify">"Isn’t it ironic?" she said. "My get-out-of-jail card being exactly the reason I want to stay." She paused briefly, thoughtful.</p><p align="justify">"Okay… not the only reason," she corrected, with a crooked smile.</p><p align="justify">Wanda laughed.</p><p align="justify">"Someone call someone right now," she said theatrically. "The Ice Queen is melting."</p><p align="justify">Jen appeared right after, visibly happy, throwing herself onto Wanda’s lap without any ceremony.</p><p align="justify">"What a wonderful night," she sighed. "I’ve never kissed so much in my life."</p><p align="justify">Before anyone could reply, the DJ announced into the microphone,</p><p align="justify">"Last song of the night!"</p><p align="justify">The lights changed, the sound rose, and the whole group stood up almost at the same time. The four ran to the middle of the floor, laughing, tripping over one another, forming a small, chaotic, familiar circle. They danced without choreography, without intent to provoke, without any plan at all—just friends, just tired, happy bodies, just that moment. And as they spun together, the sound filling everything, Agatha realized something simple and dangerous at the same time: she still wanted to be expelled. But for the first time, she wasn’t so sure she wanted to leave.</p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify">Morning arrived heavy, too gray for those who had gone to sleep with music still vibrating in their bones. The four of them sat on the cold locker room bench, shoulders slumped, eyes half-closed, each dealing in her own way with a hangover that felt like divine punishment.</p><p align="justify">The smell of wet grass and disinfectant mixed with persistent nausea, and the distant sound of the lacrosse field being prepared sounded like a threat. That game would qualify the team for the championship, and none of them felt even remotely ready to run—much less exist in public.</p><p align="justify">Jen leaned her head against the wall, breathing deeply as if that might keep her stomach from revolting. Alice massaged her temples, muttering something about never mixing drinks again. Wanda stared into nothing, wearing the expression of someone already rehearsing mental excuses.</p><p align="justify">Agatha, for her part, stayed silent, even though her whole body begged for bed and maybe a temporary exile.</p><p align="justify">The locker room door opened firmly, and the air changed instantly. Lorna entered, serious, posture impeccable, her gaze sweeping over the four as if tallying damages. The simple sound of her footsteps made all of them stand almost on reflex, even as their legs protested.</p><p align="justify">"Perhaps you’d like to explain what happened last night," Lorna said, without raising her voice, which somehow made it worse.</p><p align="justify">There was a brief, awkward silence. Wanda cleared her throat and took half a step forward.</p><p align="justify">"I’m sorry," she began sincerely. "I think we got a little carried away."</p><p align="justify">Lorna sighed, closing her eyes for a moment, as if borrowing patience.</p><p align="justify">"From what I heard, Alice had to be carried after being found unconscious in a puddle of her own vomit."</p><p align="justify">Alice immediately lifted her head, offended even in that condition.<br/>"Actually, Headmistress, it was Jen’s vomit," she corrected, with the unnecessary honesty of someone who had already given up on her reputation. "I just lay in it."</p><p align="justify">Jen made an indignant sound but didn’t have the strength to argue. Lorna stared at the two of them, incredulous.</p><p align="justify">"I expected more from you," she said, genuinely disappointed. "You know the values we uphold here. And Alice, we’ll talk later." Her gaze then slid to Agatha, lingering a little longer.</p><p align="justify">"And as for you, Agatha," she continued, "I don’t know whether I’m happy that you finally made friends here… or furious that you led them astray."</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow slightly but didn’t respond.</p><p align="justify">"Dismissed," Lorna concluded.</p><p align="justify">The four turned almost at the same time, relief and tension mixed, ready to leave before anything worse was said.</p><p align="justify">"Not you, Miss Harkness."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped. Took a deep breath. Turned slowly. Lorna crossed her arms, watching her carefully.</p><p align="justify">"I gave your father my word that I would help you," she said. "But you’re making things very difficult."</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, the weight of that sentence sliding down her shoulders.</p><p align="justify">"You’re smarter than this," Lorna continued, her voice now lower, less rigid. "And better, too. Why don’t you give yourself a chance?"</p><p align="justify">She took a few steps forward.</p><p align="justify">"Try. At least try. Prove to him that you’re capable. Because, judging by the clothes you created last night… when you decide to do something, you succeed."</p><p align="justify">Agatha kept her gaze fixed on the floor for a second, swallowing hard.</p><p align="justify">"Don’t give up on yourself, Agatha," Lorna finished. "Because I haven’t given up on you. Neither has your father."</p><p align="justify">There was a short but dense silence.</p><p align="justify">"Now you may go."</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slightly, turned, and left the locker room. Outside, the cold wind touched her face, and for the first time since she’d arrived at that place, she felt something strange tighten in her chest.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t anger.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t the urge to run.</p><p align="justify">It was the uncomfortable feeling that maybe… just maybe… someone still believed in her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha walked on, breathing deeply, feeling the cold air hit her face as if it were the only thing keeping everything in place. She took a few steps down the outer corridor until she found Wanda, Jen, and Alice leaning near the locker room, all three wearing that classic expression of “we survived, but at what cost.”</p><p align="justify">"So?" Wanda asked immediately. "What did she want?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged, with a tired half-smile.</p><p align="justify">"Nothing much," she replied. "Spa speech, motivational… ‘believe in yourself,’ that kind of thing." Alice made a dramatic face, clutching her stomach.</p><p align="justify">"I’m still really nauseous," she complained, far too pale.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t answer. She simply started walking toward the lacrosse field, as if her body were moving on its own. She sat on the low bleachers, arms crossed, the weak morning sun hitting her straight in the eyes. The whistle blew, the game started, and within minutes it was clear Ravenswood was being steamrolled. Bad passes, slow defense, mismatched shouts. The scoreboard climbed on the other side like a mockery.</p><p align="justify">Time passed, and Agatha watched everything with a mix of boredom and irritation, like someone witnessing a foretold disaster without being able to do anything. That was when Alice reappeared, stumbling a little, her face completely white.</p><p align="justify">"I feel really sick," she said, almost whispering. "I’m going to throw up."</p><p align="justify">"Alice, there are only seven minutes left," Agatha replied, still seated. "Hang on a little longer."</p><p align="justify">Alice tried. She really did. But her body won. She turned quickly and vomited right there, at the edge of the field, doubled over, with no dignity left. Some players looked. Others pretended not to see. Alice took a deep breath, wiped her mouth with her sleeve, and walked to the bench.</p><p align="justify">Without ceremony, she tore off the game vest and held it out to Agatha.</p><p align="justify">"Go in for me."Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p align="justify">"Are you insane?"</p><p align="justify">Before she could say anything else, Melina appeared like a bad omen, arms crossed, venomous smile.</p><p align="justify">"Better to play one down, Mr. Carter," she said to the coach. "We don’t want to carry dead weight. No offense."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood up slowly.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, far from it," she replied, taking the vest from Alice’s hand. "But just because you don’t want me on your team… that’s exactly why I’m going to play."</p><p align="justify">She stepped onto the field already feeling regret creep up her legs. Her body still heavy from the night before, her heart racing, the wet grass slipping under her feet.</p><p align="justify">"Okay, Aggie," she said to herself. "Let’s pretend the ball is the last Chanel bag in the world."</p><p align="justify">Agatha ran with the stick firm in her hands, her body leaning forward almost by reflex. At first, it was pure instinct. She dodged one player, twisting her torso to protect the ball cradled in the net of her stick, felt a shove to the shoulder, almost lost her balance, but kept control with an awkward, stubborn movement. An opponent tried to intercept the pass, the stick came up too fast, and Agatha took advantage of the opening, stealing possession with a sharp, utterly inelegant strike — ugly, aggressive, effective.</p><p align="justify">"PASS!" someone yelled from the sideline.</p><p align="justify">"NO!" Agatha shouted back, already accelerating, switching the stick to the other side as she pushed up the field.</p><p align="justify">She didn’t play pretty. She played the way she lived: improvising, forcing space where there was none, shielding the ball with her body when technique fell short, using her shoulder, her hips, her presence. She took an elbow to the arm, felt the impact vibrate down to her wrist, answered with a quick spin, almost a crooked dance, keeping the ball locked to the stick. She heard the coach yell something — position, rule, strategy — and ignored it completely.</p><p align="justify">"JEN!" she screamed, lifting the stick over her head. "GO, JEN! NOW!"</p><p align="justify">Jen appeared free on the flank, cut diagonally, caught the pass midair almost on reflex, cradling the ball cleanly. One suspended second of silence — then the shot came fast, straight into the corner of the net.</p><p align="justify">Goal.</p><p align="justify">The scoreboard was still against them, but something shifted on the field. It wasn’t just the point — it was the rhythm. The team woke up. Agatha started shouting, pointing, provoking, occupying space that hadn’t seemed to belong to her before.</p><p align="justify">"MARK! CLOSE! PUSH UP THE LINE!" she barked, shoving a player into the right position, slamming the stick on the ground to get attention.</p><p align="justify">Ravenswood began winning balls in midfield, pressing higher, advancing as a unit. Passes grew cleaner. The defense tightened. Another goal. And another. The stands reacted — first murmurs, then open shouts, clapping, whistles. Melina, on the opposite side, clenched her jaw, gripping her stick far too tightly, visibly furious.</p><p align="justify">With two minutes left, the game was tied.</p><p align="justify">Agatha was gasping, the uniform plastered to her body, arms burning, legs on fire like they might give out at any second. Even so, she didn’t stop. When the ball returned to the center for the restart, she surged forward as if it were personal. She challenged in the air, clashed sticks with an opponent, knocked the ball loose, recovered possession in the chaos, cut diagonally to escape the mark, the world reduced to the sound of her own breathing.</p><p align="justify">In the final second, with two players closing in, Agatha twisted her body and sent the ball wide.</p><p align="justify">"NOW!" she yelled. The shot came hard, precise, straight into the back of the net.</p><p align="justify">Goal.</p><p align="justify">The final whistle blew almost at the same time as the collective roar. Ravenswood had turned it around. Won. Agatha stopped in the middle of the field, hands braced on her knees, breathing like she’d just survived something too big. Jen ran to her and hugged her without warning, Wanda screamed from the sideline like she’d forgotten every school rule, Alice gave a thumbs-up even though she was still a little green, smiling crookedly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">After the game, everyone was gathered in the great hall. The buzz still carried the echo of the stands, laughter mixed with excited commentary, the smell of grass and sweat clinging to the players like an invisible medal.</p><p align="justify">Agatha walked in with the rest of the team, her body still warm from the effort, her heart beating too hard for a Sunday morning. She felt the curious, assessing looks — some openly incredulous — sticking to her as if she’d suddenly become unavoidable.</p><p align="justify">Lorna stepped onto the small stage at the front of the hall, waited for silence to settle with the patience of someone who knew it was guaranteed, and then spoke. Her voice was firm, proud, not hiding her satisfaction.</p><p align="justify">"I want to congratulate the lacrosse team," she said. "Ravenswood has just advanced to the second round of the county championship. Something that hasn’t happened since 1996."</p><p align="justify">For a second, there was silence. Then applause. Strong, growing, spreading through the hall until it became full, vibrant sound. Some players exchanged looks as if they still couldn’t believe it. Others smiled openly, emotional. Wanda clapped with exaggerated enthusiasm, Jen whistled loudly, Alice applauded over her head, completely ignoring Sue’s disapproving glare somewhere in the room.</p><p align="justify">Lorna waited for the applause to die down before continuing.</p><p align="justify">"And more," she added, with a slight smile. "Coach Peggy and I have decided that, from now on, anyone who wants extra training should look for…"</p><p align="justify">She paused, just long enough.</p><p align="justify">"…Miss Agatha Harkness."</p><p align="justify">The hall reacted as if a spark had been thrown into the air. Murmurs, exclamations, heads turning all at once. Agatha felt her stomach drop for a second — not fear, but shock. She blinked, sure she’d misheard.</p><p align="justify">Melina, in one corner of the hall, looked petrified. Her face rigid, eyes too wide, as if that sentence had dismantled an entire structure she believed unshakable. Her hands clenched uselessly around her stick, unable to react.</p><p align="justify">Some students began approaching Agatha, timid at first. A "good game," a nod, a quick smile. Others watched from a distance, still uncertain, as if trying to reconcile the image of the troublemaker with the newly announced captain. Agatha responded as best she could — a half-smile here, a "thanks" there — still processing everything.</p><p align="justify">Coach Peggy stepped forward, resting a hand naturally on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify">"From today on," she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, "Agatha Harkness is the team captain."</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was short but heavy. Then new applause. Different. Less surprised, more solid. Agatha felt something strange tighten in her chest — a mix of pride, disbelief, and a hint of fear. Leadership meant staying. It meant commitment. It meant not being expelled anytime soon.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">The following weeks passed in a fast blur, days stitched to cold mornings and exhausted late afternoons, as if time had decided to run alongside them without asking permission. Agatha threw herself into the role of captain with the same intensity she applied to everything in life: no middle ground, no smoothing edges. If there was anything she loved more than her outrageously expensive bags, it was winning — and winning there, in the place she’d sworn to hate, tasted unexpectedly delicious, almost addictive.</p><p align="justify">Almost every practice began the same way. Agatha appeared on the field before everyone else, heart-shaped sunglasses on her face, completely out of place against the wet grass and gray English sky. A lollipop always tucked between her lips — sometimes cherry, sometimes cola — cheap sugar used as improvised fuel to keep her mind sharp. It was an almost absurd image: the captain looking like a 2000s pop star, slowly sucking on candy while surveying the field like a general studying a war map.</p><p align="justify">Practices started early. Much earlier. The sun barely rose behind Ravenswood’s old buildings when Agatha was already there, whistle hanging from her neck, an improvised clipboard in hand, sunglasses slipping slightly down her nose. Patience was nonexistent. She didn’t yell for sport — she yelled because she wanted results.</p><p align="justify">Extra laps for missed passes. Endless repetitions until arms burned. Tight marking until legs shook. Between commands, the sharp crack of the lollipop snapping between her teeth.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t ask. She ordered. She didn’t explain twice. And slowly, the team understood: this wasn’t cruelty — it was focus. It was someone who knew exactly where she wanted to go and refused to accept anything less.</p><p align="justify">"Again," she would say flatly, removing her sunglasses just to stare at whoever had failed.</p><p align="justify">"Until it’s right," she’d add, without raising her voice — which was more frightening than any shout.</p><p align="justify">Results came too fast to ignore. Ravenswood stopped being the team that "tried" and became the team that pressed, that suffocated the opponent from the first minute.</p><p align="justify">The defense closed like never before, the attack began moving as a block, and communication on the field became almost automatic — quick gestures, knowing looks. Wanda organized play with precision, Jen finished with sharpened confidence, Alice compensated with tactical intelligence what she lacked in stamina.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stitched it all together, seeing spaces before they existed, anticipating mistakes, turning chaos into advantage.</p><p align="justify">By the time they reached the county finals, there was no doubt left within the team. The match was hard, physical, tense, with constant collisions and shouts from the sidelines. But Ravenswood stepped onto the field knowing exactly what it wanted.</p><p align="justify">The final score — 12 to 5 — wasn’t just a win; it was a statement. The last team fell without knowing exactly when it had lost control, only realizing too late there was no way back.</p><p align="justify">At the final whistle, Agatha stood still in the middle of the field for a few seconds, hands on her hips, chest rising and falling too fast.</p><p align="justify">The team’s scream came after, like a wave. Players hugging, laughing loudly, some crying without quite knowing why. Agatha was pulled into the middle of the chaos — someone splashed water on her, another nearly knocked her over with a hug.</p><p align="justify">She laughed. For real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lacrosse break arrived with relentless rain, turning the field into mud and giving Agatha exactly what she needed: time. Time to return to the original plan — or at least the perfect excuse to go out with Rio without raising suspicion. The school slipped into that strange rhythm of gray days, quieter corridors, and classes that seemed to drag. But for Agatha, the calendar had one date circled in neon.</p><p align="justify">The 18th.</p><p align="justify">Agatha woke up in a good mood — rare enough to deserve public record. Still in pajamas, sitting on her bed with her laptop open, she updated her followers on Twitter with exaggerated commentary about the week, the depressing English weather, and the universal injustice of sunlight not existing in that place. The smile came easily, fingers flying over the keyboard, as if everything were finally aligning.</p><p align="justify">Alice burst into the room almost bouncing.</p><p align="justify">"The real princess has arrived." Agatha jumped up, eyes shining.</p><p align="justify">"Seriously?" she asked, already grabbing her jacket. "Oh my God, it’s today."</p><p align="justify">Alice opened her arms and the two of them spun in a silly little circle in the middle of the room, laughing softly as if celebrating something forbidden.</p><p align="justify">"Wish me luck," Agatha said, taking a deep breath.</p><p align="justify">"All of it," Alice replied. "Go make history."</p><p align="justify">Agatha went down the stairs with steps far too light for someone who claimed to hate that place. Cold air hit her face as soon as she stepped outside, and there was Rio, a little off from the main entrance, hands in her pockets, posture far too relaxed for someone clearly waiting. When Agatha appeared, the smile came automatically.</p><p align="justify">"Hi," Rio said, opening her arms.</p><p align="justify">Agatha went to her without hesitation, the hug easy, natural.</p><p align="justify">"How was your trip to London?" Agatha asked, her face far too close to be casual.</p><p align="justify">"Boring," Rio replied, rolling her eyes. "And I heard you became the team’s new star."</p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, pleased.</p><p align="justify">"I’m the best at anything I do. That’s not news."</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly — the laugh she saved for when Agatha said things like that, clearly loving it.</p><p align="justify">"Modest, too."</p><p align="justify">"I learned from you," Agatha shot back. "Though you still need lessons on how to clean boots properly."</p><p align="justify">"I do what I can, princess," Rio replied, with mock resignation.</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, satisfied to get exactly the reaction she wanted. Their game was clear now: small provocations, one step forward, one step back. Rio opened the car door for Agatha with exaggerated politeness.</p><p align="justify">"After you, miss."</p><p align="justify">"Finally someone who knows their place," Agatha said, getting in without hiding her smile.</p><p align="justify">Rio closed the door, walked around, and took the wheel. The car pulled away smoothly, leaving Ravenswood behind as they headed toward the city of York. The sky stayed gray, the road wet. But inside the car, the mood was different.</p><p align="justify">York greeted them with its old charm that seemed to exist despite the overcast sky. Stone streets glistened from recent rain, shop windows reflected warm yellow lights, and the pace was far too calm for someone like Agatha, who watched everything with a mix of curiosity and silent judgment. Rio walked beside her naturally, as if every corner were familiar, greeting people she recognized here and there — always discreet, always comfortable in that world.</p><p align="justify">"So…" Agatha began, eyeing a tiny shop full of medieval trinkets. "You actually sell this as serious souvenirs?"</p><p align="justify">"Hey, respect local history," Rio replied, laughing. "Not everyone needs a Chanel bag to be happy."</p><p align="justify">"I profoundly disagree," Agatha said, feigning outrage. "But I admit it’s… picturesque."</p><p align="justify">They walked on, talking about absolutely nothing and everything at once. Agatha complained about the cold, Rio mocked her exaggerated drama, and now and then their shoulders brushed without either of them commenting. At one point, Rio stopped in front of a small, simple place, almost hidden between old buildings.</p><p align="justify">"Trust me," she said, already pushing the door open.</p><p align="justify">The place was small, heavy smell of frying oil in the air, worn metal counter, just a few tables. Agatha looked around cautiously.</p><p align="justify">"Rio…" she started, suspicious.</p><p align="justify">"It’s traditional," Rio replied, smiling like someone keeping a secret. "Bread with fries inside. Double carbs. A classic."</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p align="justify">"This is… horrifying. You put food inside food?"</p><p align="justify">"Stop being dramatic," Rio said, already ordering. "Do you trust me or not?"</p><p align="justify">Minutes later, Rio came back with the “dish.” Agatha stared at it as if it were a personal challenge.</p><p align="justify">"I refuse," she said, crossing her arms. "This violates at least three international laws."</p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, amused, and then did something unexpected: she stepped closer, held the bread firmly, and brought it up to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p align="justify">"Open," she said softly, almost like a provocation.</p><p align="justify">Agatha opened her mouth by reflex, more because of the proximity than the food. She took a small, reluctant bite. Chewed slowly, ready to complain.</p><p align="justify">She stopped.</p><p align="justify">"…Damn." Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">"You liked it."</p><p align="justify">"I will not admit that out loud," Agatha replied, pointing a finger at her. "But… it’s acceptable."</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, satisfied.</p><p align="justify">"I knew it. You just need to be convinced the right way." Agatha finished chewing, wiped her fingers with a napkin, and looked at Rio sideways, assessing her as if reconsidering several things at once.</p><p align="justify">"Careful," she said. "If you keep this up, I might actually start liking you."</p><p align="justify">Rio held her gaze, the smile shrinking just a little, turning more serious.</p><p align="justify">"Maybe that’s the risk," she replied.</p><p align="justify">After eating and spending some time walking through the city, the two of them slowed their pace almost without noticing, walking closer together, shoulder to shoulder, as if York had shrunk around them. Rio broke the silence with a tone far too casual for someone who was clearly curious.</p><p align="justify">"Do you want to go somewhere specific?" she asked, tossing the car keys from one hand to the other.</p><p align="justify">Agatha thought for a second, her eyes drifting over the streetlights, then answered plainly.</p><p align="justify">"I want to talk to you."</p><p align="justify">Rio stopped walking and looked at Agatha for a moment, evaluating her with that attentive gaze that seemed to see past what was said. Then she nodded, simply.</p><p align="justify">"Alright."</p><p align="justify">They went to the car, and Rio drove without saying where. The ride was quiet, but not empty — the kind of comfortable silence broken only by the low hum of the engine and the wind slipping in through the window. When the car stopped, Agatha understood. In front of them, a lookout opened over the city, a wide, almost cinematic view, lights scattered like irregular constellations and the heavy sky promising more rain.</p><p align="justify">They stood there, leaning against the car, close enough to feel each other’s warmth. Agatha spoke first.</p><p align="justify">"I looked into your past."</p><p align="justify">Rio turned her head slowly, a playful smile appearing even before she answered. She reached out and lightly touched Agatha’s blonde curls, twirling one around her finger.</p><p align="justify">"And what did you find?" she asked, genuinely curious.</p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, pretending to think.</p><p align="justify">"Some interesting news." She smiled to the side. "About a certain unauthorized party in a castle in Scotland… that ended in chaos."</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, not denying it.</p><p align="justify">"Yes. That happened."</p><p align="justify">"It’s funny," Agatha continued, "because it kind of ended the same way here." She made a vague gesture with her hand. "I threw my stepmother’s clothes into the pool. It went viral. Total chaos. Complete family disaster."</p><p align="justify">Rio let out a real laugh this time, resting an elbow on the car.</p><p align="justify">"You’re a bad girl."</p><p align="justify">"Me?" Agatha scoffed, placing a hand on her chest. "Never. Just… creative."</p><p align="justify">The mood softened, and the conversation naturally drifted into something more intimate. Agatha talked about her family, about the mother who had died when she was a child, about the absence that never really stopped existing. Rio didn’t interrupt, just listened, attentive, her gaze fixed on Agatha as if the moment demanded respect.</p><p align="justify">When it was her turn, Rio sighed before speaking.</p><p align="justify">"My relationship with my parents is… complicated." She shrugged. "It always has been. I get along better with my brother. These days, he decides almost everything. More than my father does."</p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her in silence for a few seconds, taking it in. There was something unexpectedly human about Rio in that moment, far from the image of a duchess, an untouchable alpha, or a walking problem.</p><p align="justify">"I imagine it’s not easy," Agatha said at last.</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled lightly, without drama.</p><p align="justify">"It isn’t. But you learn to live with it."</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled in that calm way that always seemed to hide something, and with a slow gesture brushed the strand of hair falling over Agatha’s face, tucking it behind her ear. The touch was light, almost too careful for someone with such a reputation for trouble. Her fingertips lingered on Agatha’s skin a second longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify">"I like that you’re like this," Rio said, her voice low and sincere. "Even though I don’t believe for a second that you’re actually cruel."</p><p align="justify">She lightly touched the tip of Agatha’s nose, an almost childish gesture, provocative in its delicacy. Agatha smiled — a crooked smile, the kind that asked for neither permission nor forgiveness. The wind passed between them, but the cold felt very far away.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand was still on Agatha’s face when the blonde’s eyes rolled — not in boredom, but in decision. Without warning, Agatha moved forward, climbing into Rio’s lap with a confident motion, as if that space had always belonged to her.</p><p align="justify">Her hands cupped Rio’s face firmly, thumbs lightly pressing along the line of her jaw, and then Agatha kissed her. Rio’s hands came up, settling at Agatha’s waist — not to guide her, but to feel the warmth through her thin shirt.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers tightened at Agatha’s waist, a soft moan vibrating against Agatha’s mouth as she opened to the kiss.</p><p align="justify">The kiss deepened instantly, tongues meeting in a slow, hot slide that sent a shock straight to Agatha’s core. She could feel the firm erection of Rio’s penis, already hard, pressing against the seam of her jeans exactly where she needed it.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s hands stayed at Agatha’s waist, not pulling her closer, just keeping her there. The kiss deepened at exactly the right rhythm. Agatha’s body moved on Rio’s lap as she kissed her lips, feeling the subtle hardness beneath her. Agatha sighed. Then she spoke.</p><p align="justify">Agatha gasped, breaking the kiss, her forehead resting against Rio’s.</p><p align="justify">“I’m a virgin,” she whispered, the words an ardent confession hanging in the small space between them. Rio’s eyes, dark and half-lidded, examined her. Her hands slid along Agatha’s back, pulling her closer.</p><p align="justify">“Do you want this?” Rio asked, her voice rough, a thin thread of control woven through the desire.</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Agatha whispered.</p><p align="justify">Rio took a slow, deep breath. “I’ll be careful.”</p><p align="justify">Rio's hands moved, one entwining in her hair, the other sliding down, encircling the blonde's buttocks, his hand slipping under Agatha's skirt, pulling it down in a slow, intense rhythm against the stiffness of his member.</p><p align="justify">Agatha moaned, the exquisite friction even through the layers of her skirt. She could feel herself getting wet, a moist heat blooming between her legs that made her writhe desperately. Rio's mouth left hers, leaving a trail of hot, open kisses down her neck, sucking on the sensitive skin above her wrist. Agatha's head fell back with a thud against the window.</p><p align="justify">"Rio…"</p><p align="justify">"Shhh," Rio murmured against her skin, his hands moving inside Agatha's skirt. The cold air hit Agatha's stomach as Rio pulled her jeans and panties down, over her hips, just enough to lower them.</p><p align="justify">The omega helped, writhing, kicking the tangled fabric down from her thighs. Rio's touch was precise, her fingers brushing the curls at the apex of Agatha's thighs. A touch so light it was agony. Agatha arched her hips, seeking more.</p><p align="justify">"It's okay, let me know if it hurts," Rio whispered, but her own breath was ragged. She leaned back, her gaze dropping between Agatha's legs.</p><p align="justify">"You're beautiful." The compliment made Agatha's core clench. Rio teased. A long finger traced her cleft, gathering the moisture there, spreading it over her lips. Agatha moaned, her hips moving involuntarily.</p><p align="justify">"Tell me what you want, princess," Rio said, her voice a low command as she circled Agatha's entrance, but without penetrating.</p><p align="justify">"I feel… empty," Agatha gasped, the honesty ripped from her lips.</p><p align="justify">Rio's finger pressed forward, just the tip, penetrating her. A sharp, intense sensation, not exactly pain, but a complete and impressive stretching. Agatha cried out, her nails digging into Rio's shoulders.</p><p align="justify">"Breathe," Rio calmed her, remaining completely still, her other hand caressing Agatha's thigh.</p><p align="justify">"More," she begged.</p><p align="justify">Rio slid deeper, the entire length of her finger sinking into Agatha's pulsating core. Agatha's internal muscles vibrated around him, trying to adjust. Rio began to move, a slow, deep thrust, then advancing again. The friction was unbelievable, a warm, slippery drag against sensitive walls Agatha didn't even know existed.</p><p align="justify">“That…,” Agatha groaned, riding Rio’s hand, the steering wheel pressing against her spine. “Don’t stop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I won’t stop,” Rio promised, her voice tense. She added a second finger, dilating Agatha even more. The burning was intense, a moment of ardent resistance before her body yielded, accepting it. Agatha threw her head back, a muffled sound escaping her throat. It was too much. It was perfect.</p><p align="justify">Rio curled her fingers, searching, and grazed a deep spot that made Agatha see stars. Her whole body arched, a sharp cry escaping her lips.</p><p align="justify">“There! Right there!” Rio found a rhythm, penetrating her with those two fingers, while her thumb moved up to circle Agatha’s clitoris. The double sensation was overwhelming. Pleasure.</p><p align="justify">The tension coiled tightly in her belly, like a spring about to break. Rio's mouth returned to hers, muffling her moans, their tongues dancing in sync with the thrusts of his fingers.</p><p align="justify">"That's it, princess," Rio growled into her mouth, her own hips moving beneath Agatha, seeking friction for her own hard cock trapped in his pants.</p><p align="justify">The obscene words propelled Agatha upward. The tension broke. Pleasure exploded within her, violent and overwhelming. Her pussy tightened tightly around Rio's fingers, milking them as wave after wave of intense sensations coursed through her. She screamed into Rio's mouth, her body trembling, shuddering with convulsions.</p><p align="justify">Rio supported her through it all, her fingers still working gently inside her, prolonging the waves until they dissipated in soft tremors. The omega grew weak, collapsing against Rio, her sweaty forehead resting on her shoulder. She could feel Rio's heart pounding against hers.</p><p align="justify">Slowly, carefully, Rio withdrew her fingers. Agatha felt the loss immediately, a deep, hollow pain. Rio brought her glistening fingers to hwe mouth, never breaking eye contact, and sucked on them until they were clean.</p><p align="justify"><br/><br/></p>

The lights of Ravenswood emerged from behind the ancient trees like a silent warning that reality was back. Agatha sighed at the sight of the school. The real world smelled like damp stone and rules.</span></p><p><span>Before she could say anything, Rio reached for one of her blonde curls, wrapping it around her fingers and lightly crushing the strand, as if she wanted to mark the moment.</span></p><p><span>“I liked our outing.” Rio raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p><span>“Oh really… so you’re admitting it.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t think you’ve won anything, Your Highness.” Agatha tilted her face slightly, her eyes gleaming with contained irony. “I just said it was pleasant.”</span></p><p><span>“Alright, princess.”</span></p><p><span>Rio moved a little closer. The space between them shrank until it almost disappeared. First, she placed a slow kiss along Agatha’s jaw, just below her ear. Then, unhurried, she found her lips. The kiss was firm, warm, self-assured. Agatha sighed against Rio’s mouth, feeling the shiver run from her neck down to her shoulders. For a second, she completely forgot where they were. When she pulled away, she stepped out of the car before the moment could grow too large.</span></p><p><span>“See you soon?” Rio asked, leaning against the steering wheel as if she already knew the answer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha adjusted her bag on her shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Good luck getting in here. They’ll definitely smell you on me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, far too calm.</span></p><p><span>“I’d rather they know who you belong to.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, a theatrical disdain that didn’t even convince herself.</span></p><p><span>“If you want to mark territory, you’ll have to work a lot harder, alpha.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s canines almost gleamed when she smiled.</span></p><p><span>“Luckily, I like a challenge.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha put on her sunglasses, even though they were unnecessary at that hour, and blew a kiss into the air before turning away. She entered the building with steps far too light for someone who had just flirted with danger. Excited.</span></p><p><span>She walked down the corridors toward the dorm still tasting fries and defiance on her lips, still feeling Rio’s touch on her skin, still wearing that insolent smile she carried whenever she knew she had won something — or someone.</span></p><p><span>She should have noticed something was wrong the moment the hallway went silent. When the looks turned toward her like blades. When the whispers were no longer curious, but sharp. When a few girls laughed too softly to be coincidence. But Agatha Harkness had never been good at listening to omens.</span></p><p><span>She pushed the bedroom door open brightly.</span></p><p><span>“Girls! You won’t believe this!”</span></p><p><span>The excitement died in her throat.</span></p><p><span>The air was heavy. Dense. Wanda was standing still, holding a sheet of paper with hands far too rigid. Jen wasn’t looking at her. Alice avoided looking at anything directly. It wasn’t ordinary irritation. It was disappointment. Something broken.</span></p><p><span>“Guys… what happened?” Agatha asked, and for the first time there was no sarcasm in her voice.</span></p><p><span>Wanda stood up slowly. The way she inhaled before speaking said everything.</span></p><p><span>“Love, I’m officially losing my mind.”</span></p><p><span>Her voice trembled at first, but steadied as she read.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>These girls are a manufacturing defect. I swear. It’s like they were assembled with expired parts and zero sense of evolution. One keeps stuffing food into her mouth only to go throw it up later like a pig. The other can’t breathe near an alpha without looking like a dog begging for attention, it’s honestly embarrassing.”</span></em></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed hard, but continued.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>And Wanda. My God, Wanda. She has that energy of someone who thinks she’s mature, centered, morally superior… but she’s actually just boring. Talks like she’s preaching at some rural sermon. And the worst part? She still insists on acting like we’re friends. Friends. I can barely stand sharing the same air and she thinks we’re having moments of connection. It’s almost touching. Almost.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p><span>The silence was deafening.</span></p><p><em><span>“This place feels like divine punishment. The clothes are awful, the rules are medieval, and people act like having a personality is a crime. If I stay here any longer, I’ll start wearing ugly sweaters willingly — and then you can institutionalize me. </span></em></p><p><em><span>I need to get out of this hell before I absorb anything from this depressing environment. Kisses from the only minimally evolved person in this damn school, xoxo Aggie.”</span></em></p><p><span>The paper fell to the floor between them.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda… I… I didn’t write that! I might have thought about writing something but nothing like that, I never wrote that!”</span></p><p><span>Wanda threw the sheet against her chest.</span></p><p><span>“It’s your email! Stop lying!”</span></p><p><span>“Wanda, forget it!” Jen stood abruptly. “She’s cruel because she’s a miserable, problematic person! That’s why she’s alone, so alone that even her father couldn’t stand her!”</span></p><p><span>It cut through Agatha like glass.</span></p><p><span>“Jen! I didn’t do this! I don’t even know what regurgitate means!”</span></p><p><span>“Come on, guys, it’s not worth it,” Alice said, already grabbing her things.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, go ahead, read another one in case you forgot.” They walked past Agatha as if she were invisible.</span></p><p><span>The door closed. The room became too large.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a shaky breath, her hands trembling as she picked up the paper. The printed screen. The header. The sender. It was her email. There was no denying it. But there was more. She turned the page. This time it was an email to one of her friends in California, Dottie.</span></p><p><span>Yes, I know. Ironic.</span></p><p><span>She thinks there’s something going on between us. It’s almost cute, in a slightly tragic way. She gives me that intense look, that mysterious vibe, like she’s living some forbidden romance. Little does she know she’s just my exit pass.</span></p><p><span>Rio Vidal is literally the perfect key: influence, power, open doors. Do you really think I’m going to waste that? I need to get out of here, and if I have to use a bored duchess to do it, so be it.</span></p><p><span>She’s smart, but when she’s with me… she becomes predictable. Falls easily when I provoke her. Likes being challenged, likes it when I diminish her a little. It’s almost embarrassing.</span></p><p><span>Deep down, she believes she’s in control.</span></p><p><span>Poor thing.</span></p><p><span>As soon as I fix my situation here, I’m gone. Simple as that. I’m not the type who gets attached. Rio might think she has me in the palm of her hand, but I’ve never belonged to anyone. And when I leave, she’ll realize she was nothing more than a convenient chapter.</span></p><p><span>And me? I move on.</span></p><p><span>The air vanished from her lungs. That… that she had written. Not like that. Not with that organized coldness. Not printed. Not exposed. But she had thought it. She had typed it. She had been cruel enough for it to exist. And now it was in the wrong hands.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face flashed in her mind. The touch at the overlook. The laughter in the car. The way she had said princess. Agatha felt her stomach drop.</span></p><p><span>“No…” she whispered.</span></p><p><span>If Wanda had it, who else did?</span></p><p><span>She didn’t think. Didn’t calculate. Wasn’t strategic. She ran.</span></p><p><span>She ran down the hallway ignoring the stares, down the stairs almost stumbling, across the courtyard under the cold wind that burned her face. The crutches had been gone for days, but in that moment her legs felt like glass. She crossed the invisible line separating the omegas’ building from the alphas’ without slowing down. She knocked on the door.</span></p><p><span>Once.</span></p><p><span>Twice.</span></p><p><span>Three times.</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Her voice came out strained, urgent. “Rio, open the door!” She knocked again, harder, as if she could prevent the printed words from reaching before she did. As if there were still time to undo what was already written.</span></p><p><span>Rio opened the door slowly.</span></p><p><span>Too slowly.</span></p><p><span>There was no surprise on her face. No explosive anger. Only something much worse — contained disappointment, controlled, almost cold. The papers were in her hands, slightly crumpled at the edges, as if they had been read more than once.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the ground disappear beneath her feet.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, I swear! I didn’t write this. I swear to you.”</span></p><p><span>Her own voice came out broken, urgent, far too desperate for someone who always knew how to hold composure.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched her for several seconds that felt too long.</span></p><p><span>“I really thought you were different,” she said quietly. “But you really are cruel, aren’t you?”</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t a shout. It wasn’t an attack. It was a fact.</span></p><p><span>And it hurt much more.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, please…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a step forward, but stopped when she saw Rio didn’t move to close the distance.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio continued, her voice firm but not harsh, “I don’t care about what you wrote about me.”</span></p><p><span>She lifted the sheets slightly.</span></p><p><span>“But your friends… that was extremely cruel.”</span></p><p><span>The silence between them stretched like an abyss.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, I swear… I…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha searched for words she had never needed before. Never needed to explain. Never needed to beg.</span></p><p><span>“I think you need to think a little about the stupid things you’ve done.”</span></p><p><span>There were no shouts. No sarcasm. Only exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>“Please, believe me.” The tear finally escaped, hot and silent.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t do this to them. Not like this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio held her gaze for a few more seconds, as if trying to decide whether there was still something worth defending.</span></p><p><span>“It’s your email. Simple. Undeniable.”</span></p><p><span>“Look… you’d better go. Before the inspector catches you here.”</span></p><p><span>That was it.</span></p><p><span>Not a goodbye. Not an argument. Not a scandal. Just the door closing slowly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, even though Rio might not even have been looking anymore. She wiped the tear with the back of her hand as if it were only a physical inconvenience, not something breaking inside her. She turned away. The hallway felt longer than ever. Colder. Emptier.</span></p><p><span>For the first time since arriving at that school, Agatha Harkness didn’t have a ready answer. And for the first time, she wasn’t sure she could win.</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p><span>The week began as if someone had pressed an invisible button and muted Agatha from everyone else’s life.</span></p><p><span>In the bedroom, the air felt different. There were no screams, no confrontations, no repeated accusations. It was worse. It was absence. Wanda talked to Jen. Jen talked to Alice. Alice responded with short, small comments. When Agatha entered, the subject changed or simply died. None of them looked at her directly for more than two seconds.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s bed became just a bed.</span></p><p><span>No sarcastic remarks.</span></p><p><span>No teasing.</span></p><p><span>No “Aggie.”</span></p><p><span>On the first morning after the scandal, she dressed in silence. For the first time since arriving at Ravenswood, she didn’t fold the skirt, didn’t adjust the blazer, didn’t leave an extra button open on purpose. She wore the uniform exactly as required: skirt at the regulated length, shirt buttoned nearly to the collar, socks at the correct height.</span></p><p><span>She looked like someone else.</span></p><p><span>Or maybe she finally looked exactly like what everyone believed she was.</span></p><p><span>In class, the distancing was even more visible. When she entered the room, the whispers began. Not disguised. Not kind.</span></p><p><span>“It’s her.”</span></p><p><span>“The email girl.”</span></p><p><span>“The one who called her friends…”</span></p><p><span>The word didn’t need to be repeated. It was already stamped in everyone’s gaze.</span></p><p><span>The teachers maintained professional posture, but there was a subtle change. More caution. More distance. As if she were a social bomb about to explode again.</span></p><p><span>In the cafeteria, isolation became concrete.</span></p><p><span>Agatha walked in with her tray in her hands, as she always did, posture straight, chin slightly lifted. But no one called her. No seat was opened for her. No inviting glance.</span></p><p><span>She chose a table in the corner.</span></p><p><span>Alone.</span></p><p><span>She sat down slowly, arranged her utensils as if it were far too important, and began eating without really tasting the food.</span></p><p><span>Across the hall, Wanda laughed at something Jen had said. Alice was telling something animatedly. Melina watched everything with an expression far too satisfied for someone who pretended superiority. Agatha kept her gaze fixed on her plate. She had eaten alone before.</span></p><p><span>But never had it been so visible.</span></p><p><span>At practice, no one asked for guidance anymore. Peggy didn’t officially remove her captain title, but the team naturally stopped looking to her. Decisions circulated among the players. Agatha showed up, did the basics, gave objective instructions. No irony. No energy. None of that electric tyranny that once moved everything.</span></p><p><span>The field felt bigger.</span></p><p><span>Emptier.</span></p><p><span>And at night, when the room fell silent, her only company was the book Lorna had placed in her hands. Alice in Wonderland.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes she reread the same paragraph three times.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes she didn’t even know what she was reading.</span></p><p><span>“Here we are all mad.”</span></p><p><span>She would close the book for a few seconds, staring at the ceiling.</span></p><p><span>Maybe Wonderland wasn’t so absurd after all. Maybe she was the only one who still hadn’t understood the rules of that world.</span></p><p><span>As the days passed, even her posture changed. The shoulders that were always held high began to lower slightly. The defiant sparkle in her eyes dimmed. She spoke only when necessary. She didn’t provoke. Didn’t laugh loudly. Didn’t tease.</span></p><p><span>Ravenswood continued functioning perfectly without Agatha Harkness at its center.</span></p><p><span>And that hurt the most.</span></p><p><span>At the end of a particularly gray afternoon, the library was nearly empty. Fine rain tapped against the old stained-glass windows, creating a repetitive, hypnotic sound.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was sitting alone at a table near the window.</span></p><p><span>The book was open in front of her. But she wasn’t reading. Her gaze was lost somewhere between the shelves and nothing. The heart-shaped sunglasses were put away. The lollipop was nowhere to be found. The pink gloss remained forgotten at the bottom of her bag.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t look defeated.</span></p><p><span>She looked… tired.</span></p><p><span>The chair beside her scraped lightly against the old wooden floor, breaking the heavy silence of the library. Agatha didn’t even need to look up to know who it was. The scent came first.</span></p><p><span>Rio sat beside her, keeping a minimal distance, but enough for the warmth of her body to be felt.</span></p><p><span>“Hi.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a second to answer. Her voice came out low, weak.</span></p><p><span>“Hi…”</span></p><p><span>There was no irony. No sparkle. Only exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>Rio observed the open book, Agatha’s hands resting on the table, her fingers far too still for someone who used to gesture even while breathing.</span></p><p><span>“I think you should apologize to your friends.”</span></p><p><span>The sentence was spoken calmly. Not accusatory. Almost practical.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment and let the air out slowly.</span></p><p><span>“But I didn’t do it…”</span></p><p><span>The first tears came silently. They slid down without warning, without rehearsed drama, simply fell. Agatha tried to ignore them, blinked quickly, turned her face slightly, but couldn’t hold them back.</span></p><p><span>And then more came.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in slightly, surprised.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t cry.</span></p><p><span>Agatha attacked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha retaliated.</span></p><p><span>Agatha mocked.</span></p><p><span>But she didn’t cry like this.</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t have to be like this,” Rio said, softer now. “Sometimes admitting…”</span></p><p><span>The sentence didn’t even reach its end. Agatha turned toward her, eyes red, breathing starting to fail.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not going to admit something I didn’t do!”</span></p><p><span>Her voice came out too loud for the room. A few heads turned between the shelves.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t care if you think I’m trash!” she continued, the words tumbling over each other. “I don’t care if everyone here hates me, if they think I’m cruel, manipulative, whatever! But I didn’t do this!”</span></p><p><span>Her breathing sped up. Too fast. Her chest rising and falling out of rhythm. Her hands shaking.</span></p><p><span>“I thought about writing horrible things, okay? I thought about it! But I didn’t write it!” Her voice broke. “I’m not that…”</span></p><p><span>The air disappeared. Agatha pressed a hand to her chest, trying to pull oxygen in as if she were trapped outside her own body.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do… I won’t… I won’t—”</span></p><p><span>The sentence dissolved into a sob.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood immediately, pulling the chair back. She moved around the table and grabbed Agatha by the shoulders before she could slide out of the chair.</span></p><p><span>“Hey. Hey, look at me.” Agatha was shaking. The tears now falling without control, her breathing far too irregular, almost a continuous choke.</span></p><p><span>“Breathe,” Rio asked, holding her face with both hands. “With me. Slow.”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha shook her head, lost.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t… I didn’t…” she kept repeating, as if she needed to convince the entire world at once.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled the chair aside and carefully lifted her up, wrapping her in a firm embrace. Not delicate. Firm. The kind of embrace that holds you up.</span></p><p><span>“Calm down,” she murmured near her ear. “Calm down. I’m here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grabbed Rio’s blazer tightly, as if she would fall if she let go. Her breathing still came in short spasms.</span></p><p><span>“Breathe with me,” Rio repeated, lower now. “Count. One… two… three…”</span></p><p><span>She followed the rhythm, inhaling on purpose, exaggeratedly, so Agatha could feel the movement.</span></p><p><span>Little by little — very little by little — the air began to enter less violently.</span></p><p><span>The crying softened into hiccupped sobs. The trembling became only a faint shiver. Rio kept her arms around her the entire time.</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t have to be like this,” she whispered. “No one has to hate you for you to be strong.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rested her face against her shoulder, eyes closed, completely exhausted. There was no provocation left.</span></p><p><span>Rio walked beside Agatha down the nearly empty corridor, holding her firmly by the arm, but without rushing. The crisis had passed, but her body still seemed fragile, as if any louder noise could shatter her again. When they reached the omegas’ room, Rio opened the door slowly and helped Agatha sit on the bed.</span></p><p><span>“Lie down,” she asked, softer than usual.</span></p><p><span>Agatha obeyed without arguing. She lay on her side and hugged the pillow against her chest as if it were the only solid thing in the world at that moment. Her eyes were still red, swollen, but there were no more tears. Only exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>Rio adjusted the blanket over her, hesitated for a second, then stepped back. As she opened the door to leave, she came face to face with Wanda and Jen standing in the hallway.</span></p><p><span>They crossed their arms almost at the same time.</span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” Wanda asked, tense.</span></p><p><span>Rio kept her posture steady.</span></p><p><span>“She had a breakdown in the library.”</span></p><p><span>Jen let out a dry laugh, almost automatic.</span></p><p><span>“Guilt makes people lose it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slowly turned her face toward her.</span></p><p><span>“No.” The answer was short. Firm.</span></p><p><span>“It was serious,” she continued. “I’ve never seen Agatha like that.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda looked away for a moment, uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span>“Unfortunately, I can’t fix the world, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>“And what if she really didn’t send it?”</span></p><p><span>Silence fell heavily between the three of them.</span></p><p><span>Jen frowned.</span></p><p><span>“What are you talking about? It came from her email. It’s there.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer immediately. Her expression shifted, less emotional, more analytical.</span></p><p><span>“What time was it sent?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda sighed, already tired.</span></p><p><span>“4:10 PM.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked.</span></p><p><span>“Impossible.”</span></p><p><span>Jen narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“What do you mean impossible?”</span></p><p><span>Rio took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span>“I picked Agatha up at 3:00 PM. She was with me until almost 6:00 PM.”</span></p><p><span>The hallway seemed to shrink. Wanda and Jen exchanged a quick look. A different look. Jen was the first to break the silence.</span></p><p><span>“Shit…”</span></p><p><span>She ran a hand over her face.</span></p><p><span>“She would never write an email with ‘regurgitate’… she didn’t even know what that meant the other day.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed hard. The anger she had been holding since reading that text began to waver.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s go to Alice,” she said, determined. “She’s on monitor duty in the computer lab today.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded without hesitation. The three of them started walking down the hallway almost at the same time, their steps too fast to seem casual.</span></p><p><span>The corridor to the computer lab felt longer than ever.</span></p><p><span>Their footsteps echoed against the old floor, mixing urgency with guilt. Wanda walked ahead, jaw tight. Jen followed close behind, still processing the information. Rio walked beside them, silent, but with that sharp gaze that missed nothing. The lab door was slightly ajar.</span></p><p><span>Inside, the cold light of the monitors illuminated the nearly empty room. The constant hum of running computers was the only sound. Alice was sitting there, slowly spinning in the chair, her feet propped against the side of the desk, clearly bored.</span></p><p><span>Detention. Courtesy of her own mother, Principal Lorna, for the party drinking.</span></p><p><span>“Wanda?” Alice lifted her head. “Whoa… what happened?”</span></p><p><span>The trio stepped inside almost simultaneously.</span></p><p><span>“We think Agatha didn’t send the email.”</span></p><p><span>Alice blinked, straightening in her chair.</span></p><p><span>“What do you mean?”</span></p><p><span>Jen crossed her arms.</span></p><p><span>“The email was sent at 4:10 PM.”</span></p><p><span>Alice froze. The color drained from her face.</span></p><p><span>“Shit…” she muttered. “I called her at 3:00 PM to go out because Rio had arrived.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded quickly.</span></p><p><span>“Rio picked her up at three.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped forward.</span></p><p><span>“Can you check the login records on Agatha’s computer?”</span></p><p><span>Alice was already standing before the sentence ended.</span></p><p><span>“I can.”</span></p><p><span>She sat at the main chair, pulled the keyboard closer, and started typing quickly. The monitor reflected in her glasses as she accessed the school’s internal system. Administrator user. Password. Login history.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s see…” she murmured, focused.</span></p><p><span>She opened the record for the machine assigned to Agatha Harkness. The screen displayed the latest entries.</span></p><p><span>Agatha Harkness — 2:59 PM</span><span><br/>
</span><span> Agatha Harkness — 3:10 PM</span></p><p><span>Alice frowned.</span></p><p><span>“Wait…”</span></p><p><span>She scrolled further down the list. Then read aloud, slower.</span></p><p><span>“Melina Vostokoff — 3:10 PM to 4:30 PM.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was heavy. Dense. Jen reacted first.</span></p><p><span>“Shit.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda covered her mouth.</span></p><p><span>“It was her.”</span></p><p><span>Alice slowly turned in the chair to look at them.</span></p><p><span>“It was Melina.”</span></p><p><span>Rio remained still for a second. Her gaze darkened. There was no surprise there. Only confirmation.</span></p><p><span>“She used Agatha’s login, logged out, then logged back in with her own,” Alice concluded. “She probably wrote the email. Agatha must have left the account open.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda ran a hand through her hair, nervous.</span></p><p><span>“She knew exactly what she was doing.”</span></p><p><span>Jen exhaled sharply.</span></p><p><span>“And we fell for it like idiots.”</span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes for a moment.</span></p><p><span>They left the lab almost running, their hurried footsteps echoing down the narrow hallway while the weight of the discovery settled inside each of them. There was no anger in the air anymore. There was urgency. An uncomfortable urgency, threaded with guilt. Wanda walked ahead as if she could make up for every harsh word she had said simply by walking faster. Jen followed close behind, unusually silent. Alice shut off the lab lights in a rush before running to catch up.</span></p><p><span>They climbed the stairs of the omegas’ building practically without breathing. The corridor was quieter than usual, that heavy late-afternoon stillness after activities. Wanda pushed the bedroom door open without knocking.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s bed was made.</span></p><p><span>Too neatly made.</span></p><p><span>The pillow aligned, the blanket folded. The copy of Alice in Wonderland closed on the desk. But she wasn’t there. The emptiness of the room seemed to expand.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?” Wanda called, though she already knew there was no one there.</span></p><p><span>No answer.</span></p><p><span>Jen went to the shared bathroom, opened the door quickly. Nothing.</span></p><p><span>Alice glanced at the window, as if somehow Agatha might have evaporated.</span></p><p><span>Rio entered last, absorbing the scene with forced calm. She walked to the bed, touched the comforter with her fingertips. Cold.</span></p><p><span>“She hasn’t been here for a while,” she said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Wanda turned to her, her face now visibly worried.</span></p><p><span>“She can’t just disappear.”</span></p><p><span>Rio took a deep breath. There was no panic in her posture. But there was tension in her jaw, in the way her shoulders stiffened.</span></p><p><span>“She probably went to clear her head,” she said, though she wasn’t completely sure. “After what happened today… it makes sense.”</span></p><p><span>Jen crossed her arms.</span></p><p><span>“What if she does something stupid?”</span></p><p><span>The question hung in the air for a second too long. Rio lifted her eyes to the three of them.</span></p><p><span>“She won’t.” There was conviction there. Or at least the attempt at it.</span></p><p><span>“Stay here,” she continued. “If she comes back and finds no one, she’ll think she’s still alone.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span>“And you?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to look for her.”</span></p><p><span>Alice stepped forward.</span></p><p><span>“We can go together.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slowly shook her head.</span></p><p><span>“No. If she’s trying to run from everyone… four people chasing her won’t help.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was reluctant acceptance. Wanda nodded first.</span></p><p><span>“We’ll wait.” Jen sighed.</span></p><p><span>“But bring her back.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t answer right away. She simply turned and left, her steps quicker now. In the corridor, the sound of her own footsteps felt too loud.</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p><u><b>Eight hours earlier.</b></u><u><b></b></u></p><p><span>The visitor parking lot was almost empty when the black car stopped in front of Ravenswood’s main gate. Melina stepped out first, posture impeccable, her uniform pressed with near-military perfection. Her parents followed shortly after — elegant, discreet, carrying that aura of people who care more about reputation than feelings.</span></p><p><span>Her mother spoke first, as always.</span></p><p><span>“So?” she asked as they walked slowly through the inner garden. “Are you already dating Rio Vidal?”</span></p><p><span>Melina’s jaw tightened for a fraction of a second before she answered.</span></p><p><span>“I think… maybe she doesn’t like me that way.”</span></p><p><span>Her mother stopped mid-step, incredulous.</span></p><p><span>“Impossible. You’re beautiful.”</span></p><p><span>Her father cleared his throat, adjusting his coat.</span></p><p><span>“This isn’t just about liking someone, Melina,” he said, his voice colder. “A bond with the Vidal family is not irrelevant. You understand what that means.”</span></p><p><span>She did. She always had. Ravenswood wasn’t just a school. It was a showcase. Melina kept her chin lifted.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll manage.”</span></p><p><span>Her mother smiled, satisfied, touching her daughter’s face as if adjusting a porcelain piece.</span></p><p><span>“That’s how you speak.”</span></p><p><span>A few minutes later, Melina said goodbye at the main entrance. She watched her parents’ car drive away and when it turned the corner, the rehearsed smile fell.</span></p><p><span>She took a deep breath. Climbed the stairs with measured steps, but her mind was boiling. That was when Agatha passed her in the hallway.</span></p><p><em><span>Without stopping.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Without really looking.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Without caring.</span></em></p><p><span>She went down the stairs with that careless, almost mocking attitude.</span></p><p><span>Melina slowly turned her head, following her with her gaze. She walked to the corridor window.</span></p><p><span>And saw it. Agatha getting into Rio’s black convertible. Laughing. Natural. As if that place already belonged to her.</span></p><p><span>Melina’s chest tightened with something that wasn’t just jealousy — it was humiliation.</span></p><p><span>The anger rose hot and immediate. She stepped away from the window and started walking down the hallway, her steps too sharp to look elegant. Her hands were cold, but her blood boiled.</span></p><p><span>As she turned the corner of the academic wing, she noticed something.</span></p><p><span>A light on. The computer lab should have been empty at that hour. Melina stopped at the half-open door and peeked inside. A single computer on. On the screen, the desktop. The user name in the lower corner.</span></p><p><em><span>Agatha Harkness.</span></em></p><p><span>Melina stepped in slowly, closing the door behind her. She sat down with calculated calm. Typed her own administrative access code — a privilege of student council president. The system unlocked. She navigated through the recent emails.</span></p><p><span>And found a draft, started and incomplete. A poorly structured complaint, a few loose sentences, nothing finalized. Melina read it, then smiled. A small, cold smile. She opened the email and finished the text with sharp sentences. Cruel ones. Exaggerated enough to hurt.</span></p><p><span>She added details Agatha would never use, words she knew would cause impact. Selected the two contacts in the recipient box. Sent it, without hesitation. The confirmation appeared on the screen.</span></p><p><span>Melina didn’t stop there. She opened the file again. Print. One copy. Two. Three. More. The pages began sliding out of the printer with that continuous mechanical sound, almost satisfying. She gathered the still-warm sheets, arranged them carefully, and stood up.</span></p><p><span>Before leaving, she switched the login. Logged back into the system for a few minutes, registering her presence there to confuse the timeline. Turned off the monitor. Switched off the light.</span></p><p><span>In the empty corridor, she discreetly scattered a few copies — inside half-open lockers, on a forgotten table, near the bulletin board.</span></p><p><span>Nothing blatant. But enough to circulate. Enough to explode. </span><span>When she finished, Melina walked back to the dorm as if nothing had happened. Uniform impeccable. Posture perfect. Heart still racing. She didn’t yet know the size of the storm she had just created. But she was sure of one thing: If Agatha wanted to play, she knew how to play dirty too.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p><span>The kitchen was almost completely dark, illuminated only by the faint light filtering through the high window, softened by the thin rain beginning to fall outside. The entire building seemed asleep, submerged in that heavy boarding-school silence after curfew. There were no voices, no laughter, no hurried footsteps.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was sitting on the floor, leaning against the lower cabinet, her knees drawn to her chest. She had been gone for hours.</span></p><p><span>Not because she wanted drama.</span></p><p><span>Not because she wanted to be missed.</span></p><p><span>But because she needed to disappear for a while.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen had become the perfect hiding place. No one would think to look there at that hour. Inspector Sue did rounds in the main corridor, not in the back of the building. The omegas avoided the place at night — except for one predictable exception.</span></p><p><span>Agatha twirled the lighter between her fingers.</span></p><p><span>The small metallic lighter with the inscription “I ❤️ Los Angeles” engraved on the side. The last object that still felt like hers. The only piece of her old world that still fit in the palm of her hand.</span></p><p><em><span>Click.</span></em></p><p><span>The flame appeared. She watched the fire as if it could organize the thoughts that kept colliding.</span></p><p><em><span>Click.</span></em></p><p><span>It went out.</span></p><p><em><span>Click.</span></em></p><p><span>It lit again.</span></p><p><span>The reflection of the flame illuminated her eyes for seconds, revealing the exhaustion she pretended not to have. Her face was paler than usual, her hair loose, no effort made to impress anyone. She wasn’t there to provoke. She was there because she didn’t know where else to be.</span></p><p><span>That was when she heard footsteps. Dragging. Lazy. She didn’t need to look to know. Alice. Always Alice. The door creaked softly when it opened, and the sleepy silhouette crossed the room toward the industrial freezer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed quietly in the dark.</span></p><p><span>“Of course…”</span></p><p><span>She spun the lighter again, too distracted by her own thoughts.</span></p><p><span>Click.</span></p><p><span>The flame lit. She brought the fire a little closer to her face, as if the heat could warm something inside her that had grown too cold in the last few days.</span></p><p><span>But in that instant, one miscalculated movement — her arm extended too far, the old curtain by the window closer than she realized. The tip of the fabric touched the flame. For a second, nothing. In the next, the fabric began to burn. Fast. Very fast. The flame rose as if it had been waiting for that opportunity.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” she muttered, her brain taking half a second to process it.</span></p><p><span>“Shit!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha jumped up from the floor, slapping at the fabric in panic. The fire spread in a bright orange streak before being smothered by her hands, which pressed and rubbed the cloth hard.</span></p><p><span>The smell of burnt fabric filled the air. Her heart pounded. She finally managed to extinguish the flame, leaving a dark, charred stain on the curtain.</span></p><p><span>Silence returned. </span><span>But now it felt threatening. Alice was still at the freezer, back turned, too distracted to notice the near fire. Agatha looked down at her trembling hands. The lighter fell to the floor with a small metallic sound.</span></p><p><span>The fear hit late.</span></p><p><span>If someone had seen, </span><span>If the alarm had gone off, </span><span>If the fire had spread.</span></p><p><span>She took a deep breath, but the air didn’t seem to come in properly. Without thinking twice, she ran out of the kitchen, her steps too fast to seem normal. She hurried up the side corridor, avoiding the lit areas, her heart hammering in her chest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha climbed the stairs trying to control her breathing, her heart still racing from the scare. She kept repeating in her head that everything was out, that it had only been a scorched piece of fabric, that no one would even notice.</span></p><p><span>The dorm corridor seemed too normal. Too quiet. She walked to the room, opened the door slowly, stepped inside, closed it behind her.</span></p><p><span>She hadn’t taken the lighter. She only realized that when she was already sitting on the bed.</span></p><p><span>Her chest tightened. But before she could decide whether to go back or not, a sound cut through the building like a blade.</span></p><p><span>The alarm.</span></p><p><span>Loud. Piercing. Continuous.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze. Doors began opening along the corridor, girls appearing in pajamas, some laughing nervously, others asking if it was another drill.</span></p><p><span>“Is it a drill?”</span></p><p><span>“Again?”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t even grab my coat!”</span></p><p><span>Then Sue’s voice echoed down the hallway, firm, without her usual bureaucratic tone.</span></p><p><span>“IMMEDIATE EVACUATION! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! MOVE NOW!”</span></p><p><span>The laughter died.</span></p><p><span>It turned into chaos. Rushed footsteps on the stairs, screams, doors slamming, someone crying. The smell began rising through the floors — smoke. Real smoke.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her stomach drop.</span></p><p><span>They were pushed by the crowd outside. The courtyard was lit by emergency lights, teachers trying to organize lines, Inspector Sue shouting orders, the alphas being directed to another part of the lawn.</span></p><p><span>Lorna appeared seconds later, her face pale but her posture firm.</span></p><p><span>“IN LINE! NOW!”</span></p><p><span>She began counting, name by name. Wanda was there. Jen too. Melina, irritated and confused. But when Lorna reached the end of the list, something shifted in the air.</span></p><p><span>“Alice?”</span></p><p><span>Silence. Lorna lifted her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Where is Alice?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s heart stopped for a second — the kitchen, the freezer. The sleepy smile, the forgotten lighter. The blood drained from her face. And the panic became certainty.</span></p><p><span>“IN THE FREEZER!” she screamed, her voice cutting across the courtyard. “SHE’S IN THE FREEZER!”</span></p><p><span>Before anyone could react, Agatha was already running. Two firefighters tried to grab her.</span></p><p><span>“You can’t go in!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span> “MY FRIEND IS IN THERE!”</span></p><p><span>She broke free, too fast, too small for them to hold properly. The smoke was thick in the ground-floor corridor. The heat increased with every step. The kitchen ceiling was already engulfed in flames climbing the curtains and reaching the cabinets.</span></p><p><span>She coughed, her eyes burning.</span></p><p><span>“ALICE!”</span></p><p><span>From the back, a faint pounding sound.</span></p><p><span>“AGATHA!”</span></p><p><span>The voice came from inside the freezer. The door was shut, but smoke was already seeping through the cracks. Agatha ran to it, turned the handle, pulled hard. The door opened. Alice was curled on the floor, coughing, her face red, eyes wide with fear.</span></p><p><span>“I couldn’t get out…” she muttered between coughs.</span></p><p><span>“Shut up and run!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha grabbed Alice by the arm, practically dragging her. The heat behind them was suffocating. A cabinet fell with a crash far too loud, sparks scattering across the floor.</span></p><p><span>They ran, stumbling, coughing, half blind. When they burst through the door outside, the cold night air hit their faces like a shock.</span></p><p><span>They dropped to their knees on the grass. Alice coughed violently. Agatha too. The tips of Agatha’s hair were singed. The sleeve of her uniform bore a dark mark. Her hands were red.</span></p><p><span>Lorna ran and fell to her knees beside Alice, pulling her into a tight embrace.</span></p><p><span>“Are you okay? Are you okay?”</span></p><p><span>Alice only nodded, still coughing.</span></p><p><span>Then Lorna lifted her eyes to Agatha. There were tears there.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you.”</span></p><p><span>Not as principal. As a mother.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to answer, but her voice failed.</span></p><p><span>Around them, the chaos continued — firefighters moving in and out, sirens, students in shock. But in that small circle of grass illuminated by red and blue lights, something had changed.</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p><span>The smell of smoke still lingered in the air like a stubborn ghost. Part of the kitchen was blackened, cabinets charred, the ceiling marked with soot. Firefighters packed equipment while technicians photographed the damage. The entire school seemed smaller. Vulnerable.</span></p><p><span>Rio walked through the space with a posture too firm for someone who was internally in conflict. As a representative of the royal family there — officially present to “monitor the situation” — she needed to appear controlled. Impartial.</span></p><p><span>Then the heel of her boot touched something metallic.</span></p><p><span>She looked down. Small. Silver. Familiar.</span></p><p><span>“I ❤️ Los Angeles.”</span></p><p><span>Rio crouched discreetly and picked up the lighter before any of the firefighters noticed. She closed her fingers around it as if hiding evidence.</span></p><p><span>And left.</span></p><p><span>In the hallway, Agatha was surrounded by students — some hugging her, others thanking her in low voices. Teachers touched her shoulder. Lorna was still visibly emotional.</span></p><p><span>But Rio wasn’t looking at the praise. She was looking at Agatha’s eyes. Panic. Real panic. Rio waited until Agatha passed a side door. Then, in a quick, firm movement, she grabbed her wrist and pulled her into an empty room. The door shut.</span></p><p><span>Silence.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, still breathless. </span><span>Rio slowly opened her hand.</span></p><p><span>The lighter.</span></p><p><span>Agatha went pale.</span></p><p><span>“I swear I didn’t mean to,” her voice broke. “I thought I had put it out.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha…” Rio kept her tone low, but firm. “This is serious. This isn’t just ‘boarding school mischief.’ This is a crime.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio, I… I put it out. I did! It was just a second. I didn’t think—”</span></p><p><span>Her breathing began to falter.</span></p><p><span>Rio ran a hand over her face, trying to stay levelheaded.</span></p><p><span>“The firefighters are already saying it wasn’t accidental.” </span><span>Silence fell heavily between them.</span></p><p><span>“I believe you’ll tell the truth,” Rio continued. “I know you’ll be honest about this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a humorless laugh.</span></p><p><span>“Honest?”</span></p><p><span>She ran her hands through her hair, pacing in short circles until she lost strength and slid down the wall, sitting on the floor.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to jail.”</span></p><p><span>The sentence came out small. Childlike.</span></p><p><span>Rio sighed and sat beside her, not caring that her impeccable uniform touched the dusty floor.</span></p><p><span>“You’re not going to jail.”</span></p><p><span>“You can’t promise that.”</span></p><p><span>“No, I can’t,” Rio admitted. “But I can promise I won’t let you face this alone.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her face toward her, eyes wet.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t want to hurt anyone.”</span></p><p><span>“I know.”</span></p><p><span>“I just…” she closed her eyes. “I was trying not to think.” </span><span>Rio remained silent for a few seconds.</span></p><p><span>“You were playing with fire, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>“I always do.”</span></p><p><span>“I know.”</span></p><p><span>The answer came almost like a sigh, </span><span>Rio took the lighter from her hand and twirled it between her fingers.</span></p><p><span>“The difference is that this time, the fire answered.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the floor.</span></p><p><span>“If I confess, I’m leaving this place.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe.”</span></p><p><span>“And if I don’t?”</span></p><p><span>Rio slowly turned her face toward her.</span></p><p><span>“Then someone innocent might pay for it. Or worse, the investigation might become something bigger than you imagine.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady the trembling.</span></p><p><span>“Are you going to report me?”</span></p><p><span>The question hung there.</span></p><p><span>Rio held her chin, making her look up.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to protect you. But I won’t lie for you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes filled again.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t want it to be like this.” </span><span>Rio moved a little closer.</span></p><p><span>“I know.”</span></p><p><span>The silence that followed was dense, heavy with decision.</span></p><p><span>“What are you going to do?” Rio asked, softer now. </span><span>Agatha closed her eyes for a second too long. When she opened them, there was fear there. But also something else. Responsibility.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to tell.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded slowly.</span></p><p><span>“Then I’ll be by your side when you do.”</span></p><p align="center"><span>━━━━━━ • ✿ • ━━━━━━</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p><span>The next day the auditorium was packed. There was none of the usual murmur before assemblies. No excited whispers or muffled giggles. There was tension. The kind of heavy silence that makes any movement sound too loud.</span></p><p><span>The students sat in organized rows, uniforms impeccable, serious faces. Some still with swollen eyes from the night before. The faint smell of smoke seemed to have seeped not only into the building, but into the school’s entire atmosphere. Agatha was seated between Wanda, Jen, and Alice.  No one spoke.</span></p><p><span>Wanda kept her hands clasped in her lap. Jen stared fixedly at the stage. Alice took deep breaths from time to time, as if still trying to recover the air from the night before.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was motionless. </span><span>Her uniform was plain. No adjustments. No provocation. Her hair tied back carelessly. She seemed smaller. On stage, Lorna stepped up to the podium.</span></p><p><span>Her posture was firm. Her expression was controlled. But there was something different in her eyes — not just as principal, but as someone who had almost lost her daughter the night before. The microphone caught the slight adjustment of her breath.</span></p><p><span>“All of you know what happened yesterday.” The silence became absolute.</span></p><p><span>“The fire was not small. It was not a trivial spark. We could have faced irreparable consequences.”</span></p><p><span>Some students lowered their heads.</span></p><p><span>“Thanks to the quick action of the firefighters and…” she paused briefly, “…of one student, we avoided a greater tragedy.”</span></p><p><span>Eyes inevitably drifted to Agatha. </span></p><p><span>She did not lift her head.</span></p><p><span>“However,” Lorna continued, firmer now, “the preliminary reports indicate that the fire was not accidental.”</span></p><p><span>A low murmur rippled through the auditorium.</span></p><p><span>“That means there was gross negligence or deliberate action.”</span></p><p><span>The word echoed. Deliberate.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her stomach twist.</span></p><p><span>“This school has principles. Culture. Loyalty. Responsibility. We resolve our conflicts here when possible. But we do not cover up crimes.”</span></p><p><span>The word was spoken without softness.</span></p><p><span>Crime.</span></p><p><span>“Therefore, the person responsible has until the end of the day to voluntarily present herself to the administration.”</span></p><p><span>The following pause was long enough that every breath in the auditorium could be heard.</span></p><p><span>“Otherwise, Ravenswood will escalate the investigation to the police authorities.”</span></p><p><span>The impact was immediate. Some students exchanged glances. Others went completely rigid.</span></p><p><span>Lorna continued:</span></p><p><span>“I still believe we are a community capable of owning our mistakes. But that decision must be made with maturity.”</span></p><p><span>She looked directly at the audience.</span></p><p><span>“By the end of the day.”</span></p><p><span>The microphone was turned off. The dry sound echoed like a gavel. The auditorium remained silent for a few seconds before the first whispered conversations began to rise. Agatha felt her heartbeat in her ears, end of the day. She had only a few hours. Wanda turned her face slightly.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha was already far away, Her eyes fixed on the empty stage. Knowing exactly that this decision would change everything.</span></p><p> </p>

The sound of chairs scraping against the floor felt distant, muffled, as if coming from underwater.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She knew what she had to do.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>When she finally stood, the movement was slow, almost mechanical. Her hands trembled slightly. The hallway to the principal’s office felt longer than ever. Each step echoed against the polished floor, heavy and deliberate.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Some students watched her. Others looked away. She walked alone. As she turned the corner leading to the administration office, she saw Rio leaning near the window, as if she had already been waiting.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio uncrossed her arms when she saw her approaching. Agatha’s eyes were red, but steady. Rio took two steps forward.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Are you sure?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha nodded, almost imperceptibly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I am.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio studied her face for a few seconds. There was no bravado. No sarcasm. Just fear… and resolve. Rio stepped closer, closing the distance between them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“What you did yesterday saved Alice. That’s also true.” Her voice was low, controlled. “Be honest. That’s all. The rest… we’ll face later.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha took a deep breath. The air felt insufficient. Rio lightly touched her arm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You’re not defined by one mistake.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha’s eyes faltered for a moment, as if that sentence had pierced through a layer she always kept protected.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She nodded again, then walked to the door and knocked softly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Come in.” Lorna’s voice came firm from the other side.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha turned the handle and entered alone. The office was organized as always. Morning light filtered through the blinds, casting pale lines over the impeccable desk. Lorna looked up from the documents she was reviewing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“What do you want, Agatha?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha stepped closer to the desk. Each step required focus. She placed the lighter on the wooden surface. The metallic sound echoed in the silence.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“It was me… this is what caused the fire.” Her voice came out low, but clear. “I didn’t mean to cause anything. It was an accident. I thought I had put it out… but I didn’t.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She pulled the chair back and sat down. The tears began to fall before she could stop them. There was no loud sobbing. Just silent, embarrassed tears. She kept her gaze fixed on her hands, unable to look at Lorna.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The principal observed the object on the desk for a few seconds. She sighed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Oh, Agatha… I am very disappointed.” The sentence wasn’t said with anger. It was said with weight.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Of all people… I would never have imagined you involved in this.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha remained silent. The air felt too dense. Lorna leaned back in her chair.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Do you know why I insisted so much that you try to improve here?” she asked, calmer now. Agatha wiped her tears with her uniform sleeve.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Because you promised my father?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Lorna shook her head slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Because I promised your mother.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha looked up, confused. Lorna stood, walked to a side cabinet, and took out an old photo album. She returned to the desk and sat down again. She opened it slowly, flipping through a few pages until stopping at a specific photograph. She turned the album toward Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Class of ’93. Liliana Calderu. Lacrosse team captain.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha stared. The girl in the picture had the same crooked smile. The same intense eyes. The same way of taking up space without asking permission.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“My best friend,” Lorna added, turning the page. Another photo — the two of them together, laughing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha was speechless.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I promised I would always help her, even if she couldn’t formally ask.” Lorna leaned back in her chair, hands folded in her lap.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You inherited a gift from her,” Lorna continued, her voice softer. “And when you arrived here, I saw in you what I saw in your mother. Determination. Strength. Impulsiveness, too.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Your mother was even more impulsive. And she paid dearly for it. She’s not here anymore… but I know that despite your flaws, you are a good girl.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The tears returned.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Lorna took a deep breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“However, rules exist for a reason. What happened is serious. Very serious. I will need to submit your case to the Honor Court. They will decide on your permanence in this institution.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha swallowed hard.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Okay.” The word came out small. Lorna nodded.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I imagine you know that, at this point, that is merely a formality.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Yes.” Agatha looked down. “The worst part is… I really tried to change. I didn’t want to disappoint you. I’m sorry.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m sorry too, Agatha.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Me too.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Take the album with you. It might help you reflect.” Agatha stood slowly and tucked the album under her arm. She wiped her face with trembling hands and walked to the door. She turned the handle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The hallway felt too bright after the office. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>And they were there. Jen. Wanda. Alice. Waiting. For a second, Agatha’s face hardened. Her expression closed like a door being locked from the inside.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“What?” Her voice came out dry, defensive. “Did you come to finish screwing me over?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The impact of the sentence landed heavily between the four of them. Wanda stepped forward immediately.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Agatha, wait—”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“No.” Agatha raised her hand, stopping any approach. “It’s already enough.” Jen lowered her gaze, visibly ashamed, hands clasped in front of her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We’re sorry,” she said, voice low and sincere. “We know you didn’t send that email.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha let out a small bitter laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Now that doesn’t matter anymore.” She ran a hand through her hair, trying to keep control.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m going to be judged by the Honor Court.” She swallowed. “Probably expelled.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her eyes moved across the three of them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“So relax. You’ll never have to look at me again.” Wanda shook her head hard.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I didn’t mean what I said that day.” Agatha looked down, jaw rigid.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Nothing that was said matters anymore. Everything’s ruined. For everyone.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence that followed wasn’t distance. It was guilt. Jen took a deep breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“No,” she said, firmer now. “What matters is what we think. Not everyone else.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha lifted her eyes.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You didn’t even give me the benefit of the doubt.” Alice stepped closer, eyes glassy.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We know.” Her voice faltered. “And we’re sorry.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda broke the space Agatha tried to keep and grabbed her hand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m sorry,” she said, looking straight into her eyes. “I should’ve stayed on your side.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tried to pull her hand back, but couldn’t immediately. The touch was warm. Real. She took a deep breath, eyes shining again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I just wanted… I just wanted someone to believe me before everything blew up.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice stepped forward.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I believe you.” No hesitation. No pity. Just conviction.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen nodded.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Me too.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Wanda squeezed her hand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We’ll be at the hearing.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“And we know you didn’t do it on purpose,” Wanda added.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha frowned slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Why?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The question carried vulnerability, not challenge. Alice exhaled slowly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Because you knew exactly where I was.” She stepped closer. “You wouldn’t put me in danger. Not like that. Not at all.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her eyes were steady.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You saved me. I owe you my life.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The weight of that sentence lingered between them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha looked away, breathing deeply.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“This is what happens when you eat ice cream at two in the morning.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The shift in tone was subtle, but enough. Jen let out a small laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Besides hydrogenated fat, you can also get stuck in a freezer.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Alice pretended to be offended.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Shut up, idiot,” Wanda said, relief evident in her voice.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She pulled Agatha into a hug. Not gentle. Tight. Intense. Agatha hesitated half a second, that tiny interval where she seemed to decide whether she could allow herself that, then hugged back. Alice joined. Then Jen.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Four bodies squeezed together in the middle of the hallway. Wrinkled uniforms. Crooked bows. Tangled hair.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Wait. Wait. Wait.” Agatha squirmed inside the group hug.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Did you all shower today?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They froze.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Agatha…” Jen murmured.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m just asking. Because Wanda clearly ran from the auditorium to here and I smell adrenaline.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Adrenaline doesn’t have a smell,” Wanda said, offended.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Yes, it does. Slightly acidic and mixed with despair.” Alice started laughing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You almost got expelled and you’re worried about bacteria?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We almost died in a fire. That’s a festival of particles. Soot. Dust. Opportunistic microorganisms.” Wanda squeezed her tighter.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Great. Now you’re officially contaminated.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Wanda Maximoff, I swear if I get a respiratory infection before the hearing, I’m suing you.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen laughed softly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You literally ran into a burning kitchen yesterday.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“That was a calculated risk. This is just unhygienic.” Alice deliberately rested her chin on Agatha’s shoulder.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I was in the freezer. Technically I’m the cleanest one here.” Agatha slowly turned her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You were hugging an open tub of ice cream at two in the morning.” Alice went silent. Wanda burst out laughing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You’re unbearable.” “I’m preventive,” Agatha corrected. But despite the complaint, she didn’t move away. She stayed. In the middle of them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The hug was dissolving into laughter and teasing when a familiar voice came from behind them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Hey… is everything okay?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The four of them turned almost at the same time. Rio stood a few steps away, hands in her blazer pockets, posture relaxed for someone officially representing the school. But her gaze was focused on one person. Agatha let go first. Straightened her uniform instinctively.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Honor Court,” she said, as if reading a sentence. “I’ll probably be expelled.” Rio tilted her head slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Wow. That’s unfortunate.” The corner of her mouth lifted in a restrained smile. Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“That’s tragic, Vidal.” The way she said Rio’s last name created a strange pause in the air. Not formal. Provocative. Alice glanced at Wanda. Wanda looked at Jen. Jen raised her eyebrows subtly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Are we… interrupting something?” Alice asked, overly innocent.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“No,” Agatha answered too quickly. Wanda smirked.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We’re going upstairs.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Jen nodded.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Good talk.” Alice gestured dramatically. “We’ll be nearby.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The three of them walked away down the corridor, clearly curious but giving them space. The silence between Agatha and Rio shifted when they were alone. Less defensive. More exposed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“So?” Rio asked, stepping closer.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m going to be expelled.” The sentence came out smaller this time. She blinked a few times. “And I just found out my mom studied here… and I didn’t even know.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her eyes filled again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I disappointed her.” This time the tears fell freely. Rio didn’t answer immediately. She stepped closer and lightly touched her arm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Come here.” She guided Agatha to a bench against the wall. They sat side by side.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“What? Of course you didn’t.” Agatha shook her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“She’d be so disappointed in me.” Rio turned slightly to face her. Carefully, she lifted her hands and held Agatha’s face, thumbs resting along her jawline.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Of course not.” Her voice was firm but gentle.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You’re smart. Funny. A little extreme… but I like that.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her thumb brushed discreetly near a tear.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“And I found this.” Rio pulled something from the inner pocket of her blazer — a folded letter. She handed it to Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Looks like it accidentally ended up on my breakfast tray.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha immediately recognized her own handwriting — the apology note she had written, thinking she might never give it. She let out an embarrassed little sigh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I thought words wouldn’t fry your brain.” Rio smiled.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“They did.” </span></p><p align="justify"><span>The silence that followed was soft.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I really like you, Rio,” Agatha said, almost in a whisper.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I know.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her head slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“And what if this doesn’t have a moral?” Agatha wiped her tears and let out a quiet laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I guess I fell down the rabbit hole and found…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She sighed. She opened the album she had been holding since the principal’s office, flipped to her mother’s photo, and showed it to Rio.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Look.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio studied the photo carefully.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“She looks like you.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha sniffed.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“She was here… and I didn’t even know.” The pain in her voice was contained, but deep.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio slowly ran her hand over Agatha’s shoulder, a steady, calm gesture.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“She was here. And now you are too.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha closed the album carefully.</span><span><br/></span><span> Took a deep breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Well…” she said, wiping her face with her uniform sleeve. “I guess it’s time to pay the price.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio stayed silent for a moment. Then she tilted her head slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Maybe.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She stood up, extending her hand to Agatha.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio was still holding Agatha’s hand when she said with quiet firmness:</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“But you’re not doing this alone. We’ll all be there.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha lowered her gaze to the polished hallway floor.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“But in the end only one of us will be expelled. It’ll be good for me to leave… I’d get you into a lot of trouble, and your family would certainly never approve of me, so…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The sentence hung there, heavy with a goodbye she was pretending to accept.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her head slightly, studying every nuance of her face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You’d be surprised.” She gave a half-smile. “And I like trouble. I feel like the more things are made easy for me, the more trouble I go looking for.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. </span><span>“Poor princess.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio smiled without denying it. The smile held challenge, not fragility. </span><span>The hallway was almost empty now, distant footsteps echoing on the stairs, the tension of the day still vibrating in the walls.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Want to get out of here?” Rio asked. “Cause some real trouble?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha let out a small breath through her nose.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I don’t think there’s much more I can mess up without going to prison.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio stepped back, adjusted her blazer with theatrical exaggeration, and gave a slight bow — an elegant provocation in the quiet corridor.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“My lady.” She extended her hand. “Would you accept getting into some trouble today with this poor alpha who very much desires your heart?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha tried to keep a straight face, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her. She bit her lower lip discreetly, weighing that absurd offer in the middle of her collapsing life. </span><span>The fear of the Honor Court was still there. The possibility of expulsion too. The shadow of her mother’s name, newly discovered, weighed on her chest.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Even so, she placed her hand in Rio’s.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You’re unbearable.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I know.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Their fingers intertwined naturally, as if that were the only stable thing in the middle of uncertainty. </span><span>The hallway still carried the faint smell of smoke mixed with fresh cleaning product. Closed doors. Distant echoes of voices. The weight of what was coming hovered over the entire building.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>And yet, as they began walking side by side, there was a quiet bubble around them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They slipped out through the side stairs, crossed the courtyard, and circled the garden to the less monitored part of campus, where the trees cast enough shadow to hide more than secrets.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio let go of Agatha’s hand only to push aside a few branches, revealing the car parked between two old trees. Agatha looked at it.</span></p><p align="justify"><span> “You hide your car like you’re escaping a coup.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I live surrounded by future diplomats,” Rio replied. “Precaution is never excessive.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha instinctively opened the driver’s door, then paused and looked at Rio.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Can I drive?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn’t hesitate. She pulled the keys from her pocket and tossed them toward her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Try not to destroy historical property.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha caught them midair.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Admirable trust.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She got into the car, adjusted the seat, looked around. The steering wheel on the opposite side made her frown.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Okay… this is weird.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio got in on the other side and closed the door, resting her arm against the window while watching.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha started the engine. It responded smoothly. She tried to move slowly, but hesitated on the first gear change. The car jerked slightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio began to laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Don’t start.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’m quiet,” Rio said, clearly not being quiet. Agatha looked down at the pedals.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Who decided to invert everything? This is hostile.” She tried again. Another small jolt.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio leaned slightly toward her, placing her hand over Agatha’s on the gearshift.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Relax. Feel the clutch before you accelerate.” The touch was firm. Agatha shot her a sideways glance.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“In the United States we drive on the correct side.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio laughed again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Technically, we’re the correct ones. You’re the ones who decided to be different.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Of course. Collective fault now.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The car finally began moving more smoothly. Agatha maintained exaggerated focus, as if piloting an experimental spacecraft. Rio still lightly held her hand during gear changes, adjusting the movement with almost provocative patience.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“See?” Rio said. “You learn fast.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I always learn fast.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I know.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The path between the trees opened onto the road. Wind flowed in through the window, carrying away the lingering scent of smoke, replacing it with cold air and temporary freedom. For a few minutes, there was no Honor Court. No expulsion.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Just the sound of the engine, Rio’s restrained laughter whenever Agatha exaggerated a gear shift, and the strange feeling that, even driving on the “wrong side,” she might be exactly where she needed to be.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The road stretched until buildings began to appear on the horizon. The city carried that steady late-afternoon movement: people crossing hurried streets, illuminated shop windows, cafés full of overlapping conversations. Agatha was still driving with focused seriousness, but her movements were more confident now. Rio watched, amused.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Want anything?” she asked, resting her chin on her hand. “Food, coffee, something sweet before your official rebellion?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha took a slightly too-wide turn, then corrected it.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I’ll accept that disgusting cold fries.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio smiled, satisfied.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I knew you liked it.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“There isn’t a Spago around here,” Agatha replied with fake indignation. “I have to make do.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio let out a soft laugh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“The demanding princess has finally surrendered to the commoners.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A few blocks later, Rio leaned slightly in her seat.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We could go to the bathhouse.” Agatha made an immediate face.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Bathhouse? Ew. That sounds gross.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Really. Too adventurous for you.” Rio crossed her arms. “You wouldn’t dare.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The challenging tone worked instantly. Agatha let out a dramatic sigh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Where is this damn bathhouse?” Rio smiled sideways.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Down the street. You can park. It’s right here.” Agatha parked with more confidence than before.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I can’t believe you invited me to take a bath.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“There are thermal pools,” Rio explained. “It’s not exactly a garden hose.” Agatha turned off the car and looked at her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“We won’t even be able to stay together. You’re an alpha. There must be a side just for you.” </span><span>Rio opened her door.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Oh, there is.” Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“And how exactly do you suggest I get in?”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Don’t worry. I’ll find you.” Rio closed the door lightly. “Go into the omega section.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha handed the keys back.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“So this is your idea of a date? A bathhouse.” Rio gave a mischievous smile as they began walking side by side along the illuminated sidewalk.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Exactly.” The building was discreet on the outside, minimalist façade, warm lighting behind pale wooden panels.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Once inside, the environment changed completely. Street noise faded. The air was lightly scented with something herbal, maybe eucalyptus and white tea. Soft instrumental music filled the space, almost imperceptible.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The reception area had a zen aesthetic: decorative stones, a small fountain with gently running water, walls in earthy tones. The receptionist spoke in a low voice, as if silence were part of the ritual.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She handed each of them a soft robe, neatly folded towels, and indicated different doors with a delicate gesture. Rio cast one last look at Agatha before disappearing through the door marked for alphas.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha entered the other one. The room was darker than she expected. Indirect lights reflected on the surface of a large central thermal pool. Steam rose slowly, forming a soft mist that made everything slightly blurred.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Some omegas were speaking quietly in the water, relaxed, leaning against the heated stone edges. The predominant sound was moving water and calm breathing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha walked slowly, feeling the warmth envelop her skin even through her uniform. At the back, she found a row of private cabins, each with a small sauna and a private thermal pool for those who wanted more privacy.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She entered one and closed the door behind her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The space was covered in light wood. The steam there was denser. The small thermal pool occupied half the room, the water slightly cloudy from the heat, illuminated by submerged amber light. The air was thick, warm, almost embracing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha leaned her back against the wall for a moment, breathing. Then she began removing her clothes more slowly than usual, folding each piece with almost obsessive habit and placing the robe within reach.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The heat was beginning to undo the tension she had carried since morning. Agatha could still feel the warmth of the shower on her skin when she returned to the cabin. The steam was thicker now, wrapping everything in a golden haze. The water of the small thermal pool rippled gently, reflecting amber light against the wooden walls.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She let the robe slip off her shoulders, distracted. That was when the curtain moved. In an immediate impulse, Agatha brought her arms to her chest, covering herself, her heart racing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"How are you here?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio carefully closed the curtain behind her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Shhh…"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She approached unhurriedly, the steam outlining the silhouette of her body. Agatha froze when Rio pulled her by the waist, bringing her against her. Footsteps echoed outside. The common area door opened.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A staff member. Rio tilted her face, pressing it against Agatha’s neck, hiding her own scent in the warmth of her skin. Agatha felt her entire body react, but she remained silent, breathing slowly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The footsteps came closer.  Pause. Then moved away. The door closed again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Is she gone…?" Agatha whispered.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Only then did Agatha realize how close they were. Pressed together. Her body still naked. Rio wearing only a white boxer that contrasted with her skin slightly damp from the steam.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha felt a slight shiver run across her shoulders when Rio’s scent became more evident now that the danger had passed. Rio lifted her hand to Agatha’s face, slowly tracing the line of her jaw, her thumb brushing near her lower lip.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"If you want… I’ll leave." Agatha raised her gaze, steady despite her uneven breathing.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Like hell you will." The corner of Rio’s mouth lifted slowly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Now finish what you started, Vidal."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>For a second, the silence between them was thick, charged with something that didn’t need words.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio tilted her head and kissed Agatha. It was soft at first, like a test. Their lips touching, warm from the steam in the room. Agatha responded almost immediately, her fingers leaving her own body to slide up to Rio’s shoulders. The kiss deepened naturally, unhurried, as if the world outside had been suspended.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The steam wrapped around them both, muffling any external sound. Rio’s hand slid along the side of Agatha’s body, stopping at her waist. Agatha pulled her closer, feeling the warmth, the contrast of skin against the thin fabric of the boxer.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>When they finally parted, their foreheads remained pressed together. Breaths mingling.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"This," Rio murmured, her voice low. "Definitely counts as getting into trouble."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha gave a small smile, still breathless.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I warned you I was extreme."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Extreme, huh?" Rio murmured, her rough, deep voice vibrating against Agatha’s chest.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You have no idea," Agatha took a deep breath, her own voice sounding strange — husky, full of desire.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's gaze lowered, and Agatha felt a physical touch tracing her face, down her throat, over her nipples, further down. She was still naked, completely exposed to the golden, damp light. The awareness of this sent a new, intense shiver through her belly. She didn't move to cover herself. She let Rio look.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Damn it, Agatha," Rio said, the words harsh. "Just look at you."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha's skin prickled. The air was thick with her scents now—her own omega anguish, strong and sweet like crushed juniper, mixed with Rio's alpha musk, dark and smoky like a forest after the rain. It was an intoxicating and dangerous mixture.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's hand left her face, sliding down. It didn't reach her breasts, not yet. It brushed the side of her ribcage, a slow, deliberate caress that made Agatha hold her breath. Rio's fingertips were calloused, a stark contrast to the softness of Agatha's skin.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You're so soft here," Rio murmured, more to herself than to Agatha. Her hand circled Agatha's waist, pulling their bodies close. Agatha gasped at the contact—the warmth of Rio's body through the thin cotton of her underwear and tank top against her own bare skin. She could feel the hard line of Rio's erect penis, stiff and insistent, pressed against her lower abdomen.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You feel it?" Rio asked, moving her hips forward just once, a slow, obscene movement.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That's what you do to me. Every time you look at me with those big blue eyes. You make me so excited I can't think straight."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha moaned, a soft, helpless sound muffled by the steam. Her hips moved back, seeking the friction.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Rio…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Tell me what you want, princess” Rio demanded, her mouth hovering near Agatha’s ear. Her teeth grazed the sensitive lobe. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Right now. I want to hear the damn words come out of that perfect mouth of yours.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha’s mind, usually so organized, was a whirlwind of sensations. The threat of expulsion, the shame, the fear—it all dissipated under this new overwhelming heat.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I want your hands on me” she whispered, the vulgarity seeming like a liberation. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I want your mouth on my breasts. I want you to touch me…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>A low moan escaped Rio’s throat. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>“That’s my good girl.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>In one fluid movement, Rio tilted her head and brought one of Agatha’s nipples into her mouth. Agatha cried out softly, arching her back against the wooden wall. Rio’s tongue was hot and rough, circling the firm, erect nipple before sucking forcefully. The suction went straight to Agatha's core, a sharp and delicious pain. Rio's free hand moved up to massage her other breast, her thumb brushing the nipple in rhythm with her mouth.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Oh, my God, yes," Agatha gasped, her fingers tangling in Rio's dark, damp hair. She held her there, pressing her face harder against her breast. "Just like that. Suck. Damn, your mouth is so good."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio switched breasts, devoting the same intense attention to the other. Her teeth grazed lightly, making Agatha shudder. Her hand on Agatha's waist slid down, over the curve of her hip, tracing the line where her thigh met her torso. Agatha's legs trembled.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Open up for me," Rio said against her skin, her breath warm.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha moved, opening her legs on the smooth, damp wood. Rio's hand didn't hesitate. She slid her fingers through the soft, neatly trimmed curls at the peak of her thighs, finding the moist, swollen heat beneath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha's head fell back against the wall with a thud. "Damn."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That's it, princess," Rio whispered, her voice thick with admiration. She pulled back to look, her dark eyes gleaming. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You're soaked, is that all it takes for me?" She brought her fingers between their faces. They glistened in the amber light, moist with Agatha's excitement. The scent, musky and sweet, filled the small space.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What do you think, idiot?" Rio didn't answer. She brought her wet fingers to Agatha's mouth. "Taste yourself."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha's eyes met her. She parted her lips and Rio slipped two fingers inside. Agatha sucked on her tongue, swirling it around her fingers, savoring her own strong, desperate taste. The obscenity of it made her core clench, empty and aching.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio pulled her fingers with a wet snap. “Now I'm going to really taste it for you.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She knelt down. Just the sight almost made Agatha come. Rio Vidal, kneeling in the steam, her face at the level of Agatha's pussy. Her strong hands gripped Agatha's thighs, spreading them even wider. Agatha looked down,</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The omega's heart pounded against her ribs. Her own intimacy was exposed, glistening, the outer lips flushed a deep pink and parted, revealing the darker, moist flesh inside. A thin layer of moisture covered the inside of her thighs.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You're so beautiful”, Rio said, her voice reverent and obscene. “I'm going to eat that pussy and you can't scream or we'll be kicked out.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>And then she leaned in. Her tongue was flat and wide, and she licked Agatha from her perineum to her clitoris in a single long, slow, devastating lick. Agatha moaned, bringing one hand to her mouth, while the other flew to Rio's hair, gripping it tightly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn't just tease. She feasted. Her mouth lashed at the omega's pussy, sucking on her swollen lips, her tongue penetrating her, fucking her with quick, shallow thrusts. The sound was obscenely wet. Agatha could only hold on, her hips beginning to move against Rio's face, meeting each thrust of her tongue.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Right there," Agatha sobbed, her knees buckling. Rio's hands squeezed her thighs tighter, supporting her, keeping her open.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Your tongue, damn it, right there!"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio recoiled, breathing heavily. Her chin was wet. "Which spot? This one?" She focused on Agatha's clitoris, circling it with the tip of her tongue, lightly and tortuously slowly.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yes! Fuck, yes, don't stop!" Agatha mumbled, without thinking. Rio obeyed. She sucked the small button into her mouth, applying rhythmic pressure that made Agatha see stars. One of Rio's hands left her thigh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha felt a thick finger, wet with her own fluid, press against her entrance. The tongue slowly penetrated, stretching her, filling her in a way her tongue couldn't.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha gasped, her inner walls vibrating around the intrusion. "More."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio added a second finger, curling them as he penetrated deep. She found a spot inside that made Agatha's entire body contract. A hoarse cry escaped her throat. Rio penetrated her with those fingers, deep and firm, while her mouth didn't stop stimulating her clitoris.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The orgasm grew like a tsunami, hitting Agatha without warning. It swept through her, blinding and total. Her body convulsed, her pussy squeezing Rio's fingers tightly, her back arching violently against the wall.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio softened her mouth, licking delicately as the omega calmed down, her fingers still inside, moving slowly until the last tremor passed. Only then did she carefully remove them and stand up.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She looked completely exhausted, her lips swollen and glistening, her eyes dark with desire. Agatha leaned against the wall, weak, her chest heaving. Rio leaned in, kissing her deeply, letting Agatha taste herself on her tongue.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's soft kiss lingered, a ghost of tenderness in the steamy air. Agatha surrendered to him, her body vibrating with a deep, satisfied exhaustion. The taste of her and Rio was a potent cocktail on her tongue. Rio's forehead remained pressed against hers, their breaths synchronized in the humid silence.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Damn," Rio finally whispered, the word a warm breath against Agatha's lips. A slow, smug smile spread across the omega's face. "You're delicious."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's expression became thoughtful, a calculated look appearing in her eyes that Agatha was beginning to recognize. It was the look Rio had before suggesting something deliciously reckless.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You know…we can move on to part two if you want.” Agatha held her breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“What kind of part two?” Rio's hand slid down Agatha's arm, her fingers intertwining with hers.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“The one where I can take it slow.” Where the heat and water do half the work. Where I can be inside you… She nodded toward the small, shimmering thermal pool in the corner of the cabin. The water shimmered, the steam rising in gentle spirals from the surface.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Inside.” The idea enveloped Agatha's mind, sensual and strange. Underwater. Weightless.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“I never…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"We'll only do it if you want to," Rio said, shaking her hand.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“You said yes to the first trouble.” Do you want to say yes to this too? Her gaze was intense, firm. “I promise it won't hurt.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The promise, the genuine care in Rio's voice, undid something else inside Agatha. The last vestige of caution dissipated in the vapor. It was no longer just about sex. It was about something new. About being guided. She trusted Rio to guide her. It was the most terrifying and thrilling realization she had had all day.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Yes," Agatha said, the words simple and firm. "I want part two."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's smile was radiant, a white flash in the dim light. "Stay here."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She stepped away, and Agatha watched, mesmerized, as Rio walked to where her robe lay on a bench. Rio was a sight, defined back muscles moving beneath smooth, damp skin, the perfect curve of her buttocks, her strong legs. She pulled something small and square from her robe pocket. A condom wrapper. She held it up, reflecting the amber light.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I told you I came prepared for trouble," Rio said, HER mischievous smile back in full force.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>She tore open the wrapper with her teeth. Agatha watched, her mouth dry, as Rio took her semi-erect penis in her hand. With precise, smooth movements, she unrolled the latex along its length, smoothing out any air bubbles. The sight of her doing something so practical, so responsible, amidst all that steam and sin, was extremely exciting. The transparent sheath outlined her curves, further highlighting the thick vein at the base.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Ready?" Rio asked, turning to her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha simply nodded, voiceless. Rio took her hand again and led her to the wide steps that led to the private pool. The water was warmer than the air, an almost scalding embrace as Agatha descended. The buoyancy was immediate, a gentle sensation of elevation. Rio followed her, the water cascading down her hips and waist.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They stood in the turquoise water, chest-deep, illuminated from below, bathing their bodies in an ethereal, shimmering glow. The steam was denser there, clinging to the surface like a blanket. The world outside the pool ceased to exist. There was only that liquid heat and Rio's dark eyes watching her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come here," Rio murmured, opening her arms.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's hands landed on her waist. Their bodies brushed against the water—Agatha's soft curves against the surface.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio's firmness. Rio's covered cock brushed against Agatha's belly, which was already stiffening again.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Water... changes everything," Rio whispered, her lips on Agatha's temple.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"It embraces you. It allows me to touch you without pressing you down."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>One of her hands slid from Agatha's waist, brushing her hip and then between their bodies. "Let me show you."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha gasped as Rio's fingers found her vagina again. The water made her touch feel different—slippery, encompassing. The tips of Rio's fingers parted her outer labia, which were still sensitive and swollen. The warmth of the water amplified the sensation, a liquid massage against her swollen flesh.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha groaned, her head falling onto Rio's shoulder. She could feel every bump of Rio's fingerprints, the gentle probing as a finger slid inside, so easily.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Feel this?" Rio slowly penetrated her with that finger, the movement creating small currents in the water around her hips.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I feel it," Agatha whispered, her voice choked. "Rio, please..."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"What do you need, darling?" Rio's voice was pure sin, a vibration against Agatha's skin. "Tell me exactly what you want my cock to do to you in this water." Agatha turned her face, her lips meeting Rio's neck. She gently bit the salty skin.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I want you to push it inside my pussy. Slowly. I want to feel every damn inch slide inside me while the water supports us."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio shuddered, a tremor that ran through her entire body and that Agatha felt through the water. "Fuck." "You and your damn mouth." She withdrew her finger, bringing both hands back to Agatha's hips.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Turn around, it'll be better."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Slowly, Agatha turned, the water swirling around her. She faced the edge of the pool, resting her hands on the smooth stone. Behind her, she felt Rio approach. Rio's body aligned with hers. Rio's hands landed on the omega's hips, her thumbs caressing the smooth curve of her waist.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Arch your back for me, just a little," Rio instructed, her voice husky.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Let your ass press against me." Agatha obeyed, pushing her hips back slightly. The water made her feel graceful, light as a feather. She felt the warm tip of Rio's cock brush against her cleft, sliding along the wet fold of her ass to find her wet, eager entrance.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Come on, princess," Rio whispered, more to herself than to Agatha. — You can tell me to stop whenever you want. With excruciating, perfect slowness, Rio began to thrust forward.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The sensation was completely strange. Without gravity holding her back, Agatha felt the penetration as a pure, centering pressure. The water supported her, allowing Rio to penetrate her at an exasperatingly gradual pace.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha watched the water ripple around their pressed hips, her own reflection swaying. She could see the shape of Rio's body behind hers, the tension in her arms as he controlled himself.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Hmm Rio…” Agatha moaned, as the alpha's thick cock opened her up. It was the same overwhelming fullness, but it blossomed inside her instead of crashing. It spread through her core, a deep, liquid heat that matched the water around them.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“That's it, my love”, Rio moaned, her forehead falling between Agatha's shoulder blades. She stopped, fully enclosed just inches inside her.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“More”, Agatha pleaded, pushing back. The water yielded, then held her, a silent accomplice.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio granted her request, pushing her in another inch, then another. Each thrust was a deliberate and sensual conquest. Agatha could feel every millimeter of Rio's cock — the pronounced ridge of the glans, the relentless thickness of the shaft — as it penetrated deeper into her pussy. Her inner walls vibrated, trying to cling to something solid in the liquid world.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio was completely inside her now, their bodies pressed against each other from shoulder to thigh underwater. Agatha felt completely filled, penetrated in the most exquisite way. Rio still didn't move, just held her there, letting her adjust, letting the heat and the absence of gravity do their work.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Can you feel it?” Rio's voice was strained from the effort of remaining still. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Yes…yes” sobbed Agatha, overwhelmed by the intimacy of the moment. The steam, the water, the absolute silence broken only by her panting breath.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Now” said Rio, squeezing Agatha's hips tightly. “I'm going to move. Just a little.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio pulled back with a slow, fluid movement that made Agatha let out a cry of pain. Then, she penetrated again, even slower than the first time. The resistance of the water created a delicious sensation of dragging, making each thrust seem prolonged, amplified.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Hmm…Rio” murmured Agatha, her voice trembling. Her fingers curled against the stone.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>“Fuck, fuck, fuck…”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio established a slow, deep rhythm. Each thrust was a complete, gliding journey in and out. Agatha's body moved with the movement, her breasts swaying in the water, her buttocks pressing against Rio's abdomen. The angle was different, deeper somehow, as if the water guided Rio's cock straight into Agatha's pussy.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Look down, my dear…" Rio grunted, increasing the pace infinitesimally.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha forced her eyes open, looking down through the crystal-clear water. Her own pale belly, the dark triangle of her curls. And there, between her open thighs, she could see the base of Rio's cock, disappearing into her body. She could see how her own flushed lips were stretched around the invading thickness. The sight was so obscene, so breathtakingly erotic, that her pussy contracted violently around Rio.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Fuck… my dear." Rio gasped, her rhythm faltering. "Did you see that? Your pretty little pussy squeezing my cock? It's the most exciting thing I've ever seen."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I saw," Agatha moaned. "Don't stop. Please, Rio, keep fucking me like that."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio removed one hand from Agatha's hip, sliding it through the water, over her belly, and down. Her fingers found Agatha's clitoris, swollen and throbbing above where they met. The water made her touch slippery, cool against the burning heat of Agatha's skin.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"You're going to come for me again, aren't you, princess?" Rio whispered, her fingers circling with just the right pressure.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The obscene words, combined with the slow, relentless penetration and the magic of the water, brought Agatha to the edge. Her orgasm wasn't abrupt this time; it rose like steam, a surging, penetrating wave of pleasure that began in her toes and surged through her entire belly. She trembled, her cries muffled by the dense air. Her pussy contracted, undulating along Rio's body, the intense, prolonged contractions in weightless space.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"That's it, love, that's it," Rio chanted, her own control slipping away. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>Her thrusts lost their rhythmic cadence, becoming shorter and more intense. Agatha felt it the instant Rio leaned in. The alpha's body stiffened against her back. A guttural, muffled roar echoed in the cabin. Inside, Agatha felt the distinct, liquid pulse of Rio's ejaculation through the thin barrier of latex.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>They remained intertwined, trembling, as the water gradually calmed around them. Rio's arms were around Agatha's waist, supporting her as much as the water did. Her face was buried in Agatha's hair, her warm, panting breath against her neck.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>After a long minute of silence, Rio relaxed and stepped out of the water. A strange feeling of emptiness washed over her, immediately replaced by the warmth of the water. Rio gently turned Agatha so she would face her. Her eyes were dark, sated pools.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"And then?" Rio asked, a trace of her old mischievous smile tugging at her lips.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"How was the second part?"</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha leaned forward, resting her forehead against Rio’s. She felt limp, euphoric.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"Floating," she whispered, because no other word quite fit.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio’s ironic smile softened, giving way to something genuine. "Yeah. It was."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio kissed Agatha, slow and deep.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>"I think we should get out of here before we turn into prunes."</span></p><p align="justify"><span>But neither of them moved. The water held them, the steam hid them, and for the first time in Agatha’s life, the silence in her mind was peaceful, not empty.</span></p><p align="justify"> </p>
