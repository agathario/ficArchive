<h2 class="toc-heading">Red Thread of Fate</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Red thread of fate.</p><p>It is said that it connects people who are destined for each other. Regardless of time, place, circumstances, it will always find a way. Everyone has someone attached to the other end of their thread. Someone they are destined for. That’s what Rio believed too. Even as a child, that thread was always on her mind upon reading a children’s book about it. But that was before she turned 18, when her life flipped upside down. One day, she opened her eyes, and she started seeing these red threads attached to people’s pinky. It was like a tangible string that is only visible to her eyes when it’s within her view. She can’t see it when it’s blocked or when it’s out of view. She tried holding one in her hands, but it only passes through as if it’s just a ghost of a string. She had her suspicions that it might really be the destined red thread. She saw it on her parents, their red threads connected to each other, glowing bright red whenever they touch.</p><p>But things like these, superpowers one might say, are just beyond reality. She thought she was going crazy, that she’s out of her mind. And as if fate was favoring her this time, her doubts dissipated the moment that she interlaced her fingers with her mother. She felt like her consciousness was pulled into the string, and she just flowed and flowed until she reached her father’s side of the thread. She started to see some of his memories, mainly his identity. That’s how she knew. She really had this mysterious power of seeing, and going through the red thread. She doesn’t know why and how that happened, but she accepted it with a warm embrace. Little did she know, it wasn’t all glorious as she thought.</p><p>Rio was walking alongside Lilia as she reminisced her first moments with her ability. She glanced at the woman beside her, remembering their first encounter.</p><p>A week after she acquired her ability, she got a severe fever that lasted for days. She felt like her head was splitting into two, her eyes felt like it was being stabbed by a thousand needles. And just when they were about to bring her to the hospital, Lilia appeared on their doorsteps, saying that she might be able to help her. How she managed to convince her parents to let her in and believe her will always remain a mystery to Rio. Perhaps it was another one of her abilities. People did trust her unconditionally and unquestionably. Without any introductions, Lilia entered her room that day, instructing to close her eyes, focus her mind on finding that ‘switch button’ within her. Rio struggled to understand what the woman was saying. She thought she was just a delirious woman, picking on a person literally on death’s doorstep. But when Rio did as she instructed, she found that button. She can’t explain what it felt like, but she knew that it felt like a switch, as Lilia said. And when she pressed that, she opened her eyes and her vision was clear from any red threads. The pain that she was feeling vanished in an instant, her body relaxing. Though, she was still feverish.</p><p>Lilia left without any explanation, saying she’ll come back in due time. She did come back when she was fully recovered and explained everything to her in private. Turns out, she had an ability just like Rio. But hers was focused on seeing people’s turning point in life, the most important event that will change the course of their lives. And in her own turning point, she saw Rio. Encountering and mentoring Rio was the one event that is going to change her life. Rio realized by then. Lilia was going to be an important part of her life.</p><p>She was proven to be absolutely right one fateful day when she was 19. Her parents got into an accident. Neither of them survived. It was a common accident, the other driver was drunk, and it collided with her parents’ car. She hated the fact that they had to go like that. It was cliche. That day was the day she came to hate fate. Was fate really that cruel?</p><p>For months, she shut down. She didn’t want to live any longer, believing her life fell apart. She wanted to follow her parents. She loved them deeply, and they loved her as much as she did. That’s where Lilia entered her life fully - the woman took her in. She nursed her during the darkest days of her life. She supported her until she got back into her own two feet. And Lilia told her - she doesn’t have to go, she can stay with her as long as she would like. The older woman explained to her the vision she saw for herself. It was when Rio became someone she saw as a daughter. She had always wished for a daughter, but she couldn’t have one. Lilia became her mother, her saving grace.</p><p>Rio was broken away from her thoughts when she saw Lilia ahead of her, looking back at her to motion for her to speed up her walking.</p><p>“Come, dear, we’ll be late for our appointments,” Lilia said to her with a quick wave of her hand. She picked up her pace.</p><p>They were walking towards their office. It was still early in the morning and Rio, despite being an afternoon bird, had to get up and go to work much to her dismay. She and Lilia run a business where they use their abilities. It’s kind of like a fortune telling, but they only offered a vision of their future and romantic life - not really focused on the fortune part. Their abilities should have been used for the good, but they have to place food at their table, right? So business it is. They amassed quite a fortune from this, they became widely known around the state due to the reviews of the successful clients. Rio finds it funny that they’re a fortune telling business, but they're the ones who got the fortune. Well, they changed their clients’ lives anyway. All is fair.</p><p>They entered their two story office. It’s a small place with only four employees, but it felt like home. Each of them belonged there. They changed lives there. They were greeted by their receptionist, Jen, who is also the one who manages their client files.</p><p>“You look extra gloomy today, Rio,” Jen stated concerned, but there was a hint of teasing evident in her voice. “Do you want one of my eye masks? ‘Cause you really need it.” Now she’s just teasing her.</p><p>“That’s so sweet Jen, do you want me to cut your string?” Rio replied sweetly with a devilish grin.</p><p>“You can’t do that,” she replied smugly. “Can you?” she added as a second thought.</p><p>Instead of answering, Rio opened her eyes widely and nodded enthusiastically at Jen. Jen raises her hand to her mouth and zips it imaginarily.</p><p>They went further into the office, and her eyes unconsciously traced Jen’s red thread that connects to Alice, their systems manager. Lilia and Rio both knew Alice first, she was their neighbor who had a hard time securing a job. And since their business only consisted of the two of them that time, they offered Alice a job. It just so happened that Alice graduated with an information technology degree. Fate, once again, had their way with them. A year after they hired Alice, Rio did a reading on her. That’s when she met Jen, her destined one. And to be closer to her partner, Jen applied to their business, which they happily accepted.</p><p>They made their way upstairs and came into a stop at the end of the hallway. Lilia entered the door on the left, which was her office, the room where she does her reading for her clients. The opposite door was Rio’s. She entered it and she was met by the refreshing air of her room. The room was filled with plants. Lilia told her to decorate it to her liking, so no one can stop her from almost making it her garden. The room was spacious, there’s her desk, a small coffee table, and a couch in front of it. There were cabinets on the side which contained files and business stuff. Framed paintings of hearts, love, even of a red thread adorned her walls. It really brought out the ‘find your destined one’ vibe from their marketing line.</p><p>She made her way to her desk and sat. She brought out the folder containing the information of her client for today. Determining that she’s ready, she rang the receptionist’s telephone, telling Jen that she can send the client in. After a minute, the client entered the room. Rio went into work mode, explaining the terms of the reading to the client. She explained that she’ll do the reading first, and she’ll decide whether to disclose what she saw to the client. This was to avoid matchmaking the client to dangerous people, dead ones, and even to children. Fate did not discriminate, so there were times that the destined one was not appropriate to their clients. If she can’t disclose the information, they won’t have to pay.</p><p>“Please give me your hand, we'll stay like that for a while, is that okay?” Rio asked her client to which he nodded.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, and let her whole body relax. Deep in her mind, she felt for the button and switched it. Everytime she does this, she enters a depersonalized state, as if viewing the world from an outside realm. When she opened her eyes this time, the client’s red thread became visible. She interlaced her fingers with the client’s right hand, where the thread was. Upon the contact, Rio felt like a strong gust of wind blew into her, and she found herself flowing into the thread. She entered the partner’s mind, careful not to delve deep into her memories, and only recognized the important information to give to the client. It worked similar to trying to remember something in your own mind, so it was not an unfamiliar territory to Rio.</p><p>Rio ended their reading with a smile on her lips. The reading was successful, and the client’s partner was a sweet lady living across the state. Determined to change his life, the client expressed that he will do anything just to be with his destiny, even if he had to move across the world. How sweet, Rio thought.</p><p>As she watched the client happily go out the door, a heavy feeling washed over her. She was happy to help others, delighted that she can change their life for the better. However, it had a cost. She can see everyone’s red thread - but she doesn’t have one. It was bittersweet. She leads people to their love, love that she won’t be able to experience herself. Lilia said that it was the cost of her abilities. So, she cursed her ability every second when she was younger. She didn’t wish for this stupid ability. She didn’t want to be important to other’s lives. She wanted her own happiness, her own love. But now, she came to terms with it after 10 years of helping others. Their happiness became her own. Though, she can’t help the feeling that washes over her when she remembers this curse that came with her abilities. She hadn’t been able to love someone, knowing that everyone that she’ll love already has somebody out there for them. She can’t help that feeling of being utterly alone for as long as she lives.</p><p>A few minutes after the client went out the door, she decided to tell Jen that she’ll be finished for the day. She felt tired anyway, and she felt heavy from the feeling. Whenever she does a reading, it takes a lot of her energy. She can only do one a day - maybe two on a good day.</p><p>She bid her goodbyes to everyone in the office and went out. The moment she stepped out of the office, she felt the cold air. She wrapped her coat tighter. As she walked, she kept her eyes glued to the ground, watching her every step. She sat on a bench as she tried to clear her mind and wash away that heavy feeling. She opened her ability, deciding to calm herself by watching the red threads wave from people. She traces her eyes from one thread to the next, seeing if someone was close to their destined one. She saw a couple of threads connecting individuals that seemed to be strangers. She smiled, knowing that these people will one day be the most important person to each other. She also saw a couple with a glowing thread, seemingly the happiest in each other’s presence.</p><p>As her eyes darted from one thread to the other, she felt her breath hitch as she saw a thread that’s thinner than the others. She felt more shocked when she saw that thread does not connect to another, it was like it was cut - torn, a better word for it. It was connected to a woman whose back was facing her. She felt herself unconsciously standing up, and racing to catch up with the woman. The woman was walking down the street - the same street as their office.</p><p>When she caught up with the woman, just a foot behind her, she grabbed her wrist, more forceful than she intended to. This made the woman turn to face her. The world seemed to slow down - just like in those romantic movies where the leads finally found each other. Her brown, wavy hair swayed from her back to her side, the scent of it emanating to the air. Lavender. And when her face came to view, Rio was met with the bluest eyes she had ever seen in her life. It was mesmerizing, it felt like she was being sucked into it. Rio observed her face in an almost slow motion pace. She saw her cheekbones, perfectly featured on her face, her nose seemingly like it was from a sculpture of a goddess, and her lips, its softness that Rio wanted to feel. She was woken up from her reverie when the woman forcefully yanked her wrist from Rio’s grip.</p><p>“Excuse me?” The woman delivered with such an accusing tone. “Do you just rudely grab other people randomly?” she continued in that hostile voice of her.</p><p>Rio looked back up to her eyes, and was met with glaring ones, eyebrows furrowed in annoyance. “I-“ Rio tried to reply, her words caught in her tongue. After a few seconds of stuttering in her own mouth, the woman gave her a last look, eyes scanning her from head to toe, and almost dramatically turned away from her and continued her walk. Rio watched her as she passed their office, and entered the bookstore just a few doors away. It was the first time she saw the woman, and the first time she saw that kind of thread.</p><p>Deciding to further embarrass herself, she followed the woman’s footsteps, and came into a stop in front of the bookstore. With a deep inhale, she pushed the door open slowly. Her nose was met with the smell of the books. Not the kind that was assaulting to the nose - it was the one that’s comforting. It’s her first time here, not bothering to even enter the place before since she’s not interested in it at the slightest. She swore to never pick up a book again, traumatized by that one childhood book that made her learn about the red thread.</p><p>She scanned the place. It was filled with bookshelves. Well, what did she expect from a bookstore? The books that lined and filled the shelves majorly looked old. It must be more of an archive, she figured. There was also a place where a couch, a coffee table, and a few chairs were stationed. And as she looked at the farthest wall, she saw the counter. There, the woman who she was following, had both of her hands placed at the counter. The glare that she was sporting early was still there. If looks could kill, she’ll be six feet under.</p><p>“Here I thought you couldn’t get any creepier,” she directed to Rio across the room. “What’s your deal?” she questioned.</p><p>“I-“ Rio started again. She felt her tongue caught in itself. She cleared her throat, getting nervous under the woman’s stare. “I just.. wondered if you're new in town? I haven’t seen you around here before.”</p><p>“What’s it to you?” she replied instead of answering.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer, but cannot, for the love of God, form a single sentence.</p><p>“Look, if you want to look around, do it. But don’t bother me if you don’t have any business with me. Got it?”</p><p>As if programmed, Rio replied with a “yes ma’am.” When the word left her mouth, she closed her eyes and mentally hit herself in the head. What the hell was that? Thankfully, the woman didn’t want to pay her any more attention and gave Rio a final side glare, entering a door leading to another room.</p><p>“So.. are you a customer?” Rio heard from her right. She was quite surprised that there was another person in the room. She turned to where the voice came from and saw a boy with curly hair and kohl surrounding his eyes. He was wearing something that resembled a uniform, his name tag saying “Billy.” She had a vague memory of seeing this boy before. He probably works here.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t see you there,” Rio answered apologetically.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he answered, giving a dismissing wave. “It happens. She’s just magically like that, catching everyone’s attention in the room,” he added with adoration in his voice. His eyes twinkled as he talked about the woman. Is he a fan?</p><p>“I’ll say,” Rio replied. “Who’s she anyway?” She changes the subject.</p><p>“Oh, that’s Agatha, she owns this place.” His eyes scanned the whole room. “She just moved here recently, she managed a different branch before.”</p><p>Rio nodded as a reply. She moves away from the counter, and decides to observe the books so that she can pretend that she’s a potential customer. That way, she can come back in here with reason. She gave up though, just after looking over a single shelf. The books were more about history, and that just wasn’t her vibe. She gave a little salute to the boy as she proceeded to the door and out of the bookstore. He smiled at her enthusiastically as she did so. The boy was sweet. And the woman was scary. That turned her on.</p><p>The next day, Rio found herself hiding behind the bookshelf after her single appointment at work. She opens a few books to hide her face from the woman she’s been observing at the counter. She’s trying to scrutinize Agatha’s thread up close, perhaps that way she would be able to explain the state of the thread. She thought of herself as stealthy, but she was proven wrong when she heard Agatha loudly smack the wooden counter with her hand. She lowered the book just enough to uncover her eyes and see if she was the cause of the woman’s action. She is. Agatha is looking straight at her with such anger in her eyes. She closed her eyes and turned off her ability.</p><p>“Do I need to call the police to report a stalker?” she asked Rio when their eyes met. Beside her, Billy pretends to be busy with something at the counter, sneakily glancing at the situation. That boy.</p><p>“What? I was just browsing,” Rio defended.</p><p>“Browsing what? Me?”</p><p>“No..” Rio replied, elongating the word. “I’m reading a book about..” She turned the book in her hand to look at the title page. Her face paled when she saw that it was a book about the castration techniques during the Byzantine empire. Talk about embarrassing. “Castration,” she whispered.</p><p>“You’re interested in removing male genitalia, really?” Agatha questioned in disbelief. Rio sensed a hint of amusement though.</p><p>“Not really, I’m more interested in..” Rio said as she placed the book back into its position, and slowly approached the counter. “The female genitalia,” she continued.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at her sentence. It seemed like she got the hidden message behind what Rio said. Good, then.</p><p>Agatha scoffed and decided to ignore Rio’s answer. “What are you even doing here?”</p><p>Having no better answer, Rio decides to market for their business. “I’m marketing,” Rio said simply. “If you’re interested,” she continued and offered Agatha a business card she got from the inside pocket of her leather jacket.</p><p>Agatha stared at the card for a few seconds first before snatching it from her hand. She took a moment to read its content. She looked up at Rio, and gave her a confused look.</p><p>“You work as a matchmaker?”</p><p>“Technically yes, it’s our business.”</p><p>Agatha placed both of her elbows on the counter, bringing her face closer to Rio.</p><p>“What are your rates?” Agatha asked, deciding to humor her.</p><p>Rio placed an elbow on the counter, bringing them much closer, as she replied, “For Lilia’s services, a vision from your future, we charge a hundred bucks.” Rio pointed at the card before continuing, “For my services, as you said, matchmaking, which by the way works as a red thread of fate, we charge two hundred. But I can give you a discount, if you’d like.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs loudly at Rio, removing her elbows and straightening her stance. “That sure sounds like a scam. And it’s that expensive?”</p><p>“Do you even have clients?” Agatha added.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure you’ll be surprised. We’re quite known in the state. Look it up,” Rio said smugly. She gave Agatha a grin, and a wave of goodbye to Billy who she caught staring at them before walking out the door.</p><p>Without fail, Rio’s in the bookstore again the next day. This is her third day in a row. And this time, she has a mission in mind. Mission: hold Agatha’s hand and explore her thread. The plan is simple: she’ll talk with Agatha (and maybe flirt a little), bring herself closer to her, and sneakily interlace their fingers. Rio was confident in her plan. But when she saw Agatha’s hand covered in gloves, her plan disintegrated to thin air. What was she even doing with gloves on? Just what are the odds? Still, she made her way to the counter to talk to the woman.</p><p>Agatha’s back was facing her as she stopped at the counter. It seemed like she was arranging books that looked as old as human civilization. Maybe the gloves were for that.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha,” she voiced out. Taking a quick glance at the boy at the counter, she said “Hi, Billy.” The teen responded with a shy hi.</p><p>Agatha turned her head back to briefly look at Rio for a second before turning back to what she was doing.</p><p>“Are you here to offer your scam to us again?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It’s not a scam!” Rio dramatically replied.</p><p>This time, Agatha fully turned to her, and went closer to the counter.</p><p>“What’s your name?” she asked.</p><p>“Rio. Rio Vidal at your service,” Rio replied, placing a hand at her abdomen and one at her back, bowing.</p><p>“Okay, Rio,” Agatha replied slowly. She leaned in and continued, “I’m only going to say this once, so listen carefully.”</p><p>“Uhuh,” Rio replied, gazing intently at the blue eyes in front of her.</p><p>“We. Are. Not. Interested,” Agatha said, enunciating each word, giving Rio a sarcastic smile.</p><p>“Actually, I-“ Billy tried to cut in, but was stopped by Agatha’s hand on his mouth, suppressing his words.</p><p>“I see,” Rio replied, nonchalantly. She didn’t really care if they’re into her business, it was just an excuse anyway. But seeing that her mission wasn’t going to work today, she decided to retreat for the meantime. “Goodbye, then,” she directed to the two of them. If Agatha thinks it's the end of their encounters, she couldn't be more wrong. She’s gonna come back tomorrow.</p><p>With a real goal in mind, Rio enters the bookstore once again. She went straight to the counter instead of dilly dallying in the bookshelves. She figured that the bookstore might have something about the red thread of fate. It serves as an archive, so she might as well just try to really have a purpose in visiting. She can only see Billy behind the counter, and when she walks closer, she sees Agatha perched at a chair, a book in hand. When she felt Rio's presence, she absentmindedly looked up, and upon realizing that it’s Rio, she grunted and threw her head back at the backrest. Rio chuckles at the woman’s antics. Sensing that the two women will bicker once again, Billy excused himself and went into the staff room. He wanted to save his mouth from any gloves today.</p><p>“You don’t even know what I’m gonna say,” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>“I know that it’ll be something annoying,” Agatha retorted.</p><p>“I have a real reason this time.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Do you believe in the red thread of fate?”</p><p>“I knew it, you’re marketing again, aren’t you?” Agatha got up from her seat and went to the counter to face Rio.</p><p>“No, I’m just curious,” Rio replied. When Agatha didn’t answer, she continued, “I believe in it. That people are connected by a string. That somewhere out there, there’s someone for you, the one you’re fated with.” She wasn’t able to hide her vulnerability in her voice. It was a sensitive topic for her, and it surprised her as well why she chose to bring it up with Agatha.</p><p>Rio saw Agatha’s default mean look falter. She probably didn’t expect this kind of conversation with Rio. She saw Agatha readjust her purple coat, seemingly changing her demeanor into something softer.</p><p>“I once believed it too,” Agatha replied. “But life happened. And when you’re at this age you’ll stop believing in those.”</p><p>Rio nodded at Agatha’s honesty. Neither of them broke the silence, and Rio couldn’t manage a response without disclosing her powers to Agatha. Instead, she decides to lighten the mood.</p><p>“How old are you?” Rio mentally berated herself with her choice of subject.</p><p>Agatha leaned back and furrowed her eyebrows at Rio. “Don’t you know the basic manners of not asking a woman about her age?”</p><p>Rio let out a guilty “sorry.” As consolation she says, “I’m 28,” she said with a shrug of her shoulders. That probably was the wrong answer, she thought.</p><p>Agatha bared her teeth at Rio, before looking away and responding with “39.”</p><p>“There’s still someone out there for you,” Rio changed the subject once again, but thankful for the newfound information she got from the woman. “I just know it,” she replied.</p><p>Agatha just stared at her, giving a look of acknowledgement. “What really brings you here?” she said, annoyance in her tone. “I doubt it’s to make small talk.”</p><p>“I’m looking for a book about that string.”</p><p>“Oh, you were serious about that,” Agatha replied absentmindedly. “Come,” she said as she made her way to a shelf in the middle of the room. Rio followed as she was told. Agatha scanned the bookshelf, looking for something.</p><p>Rio observed her from the side. She took this opportunity to appreciate Agatha’s beauty. The woman was stunning, she could rival those of the statues of goddesses. After a few seconds, Agatha picked up a red book, and offered it to Rio.</p><p>“I’ve read that book once. It tells the origin of the thread. It’s mainly based on East Asian folklore,” Agatha says as she turns to look at Rio.</p><p>Rio was surprised that Agatha even read the book, and seemed like she knew it by heart. “You’re interested in this stuff too?” she asked curiously.</p><p>Agatha gave an impression of a child caught stealing from the cookie jar. It was adorable.</p><p>“It was a long time ago,” she brushed off. Agatha passed by her as she made her way to the counter, beckoning Rio to follow her so she could process the purchase.</p><p>After the transaction, Rio said, “I’ll be sure to read it. Since it’s up to your taste.”</p><p>Agatha only replied with a scoff, and Rio offered a smile. She bid her goodbye and left the bookstore. Mission accomplished for today. However, it turns out she wouldn’t be able to visit the bookstore the next day.</p><p>There was a complication with the scheduling of the clients, and she had to do two readings today. It used up almost all her energy, and she was bedridden for the rest of the day. Lilia stayed at home to nurse Rio back to health after she’s done with work.</p><p>Lilia entered her room, turning on the lights. Rio’s eyes were blinded by the sudden light, and she covered it for protection. Lilia set a tray with food and water in it to her bedside table, and sat at the foot of Rio’s bed.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done the other reading, dear. I won’t allow you to do two readings from now on,” the older woman said as she rubbed Rio’s leg to comfort her.</p><p>“It’s okay, Lilia, I can handle it,” Rio muttered weakly. “More income for us, am I right?” she added, now almost just whispering.</p><p>“Look at you, you’re paler than a sheet of paper,” Lilia tried to reason.</p><p>Rio only chuckled as a reply. Lilia got up and carefully placed the food within Rio’s reach. She activated her ability, and saw Lilia’s thread as she settled the food. Weirdly enough, Rio liked to observe Lilia’s thread. It was black. Obsidian black, but it had this spark that draws Rio’s eyes. Black threads are indications that their destined partners have passed away. The dull ones mean that they didn’t even have the chance to meet. But the ones like Lilia’s, the shiny ones, meant that they were once deep in love, and found each other’s arms. She asked Lilia one time, asking if she’s still sorrowful about her husband’s passing. She reassured Rio to not be worried about it, saying that she was glad she got to spend time loving him. The important thing for her is that she met him, and she said that she’d rather not love if it wasn’t him since other love would not be worth it. That idea comforted Rio’s absence of a destined partner. Rio was broken from her thoughts by Lilia’s voice.</p><p>“Can you eat by yourself?” Lilia asked her.</p><p>Rio nodded and sat herself up at her bed. “It’s okay, you can go,” she said. Lilia exited the room as instructed. Her heart warmed at the thought of Lilia’s motherly care. She loves her, her second mother.</p><p>Rio underestimated her exhaustion - she’s still weak the next day. She didn’t expect that the readings would take that much energy. Fate must not be in her favor, she thought. For the rest of her second bedridden day, she decided to continue reading the book Agatha recommended. She learned the folklore behind the thread, but she wasn’t able to gain information about her own situation. Still, she happily finished reading with Agatha in mind.</p><p>She was delighted as she was able to finally come back to the bookstore after her two-day rest. Even just upon entering, she saw Agatha’s gaze already on her. There was shock in her face. Rio didn’t expect such a greeting.</p><p>“You’re back,” Agatha says in a low voice unconsciously. It was barely inaudible, but Rio still caught it.</p><p>“Did you miss me?” Rio teased as she gave Agatha a smirk. She made her way toward the counter. Up close, she could see a hint of a blush on Agatha’s cheeks. It was cute. She wants to see more of it.</p><p>“Whatever,” she mutters and goes back to what she was doing in the back of the counter.</p><p>Rio took it as a sign to go around the store. She has no purpose this time. She just wanted to see more of Agatha. She missed her during the two days she wasn’t able to visit.</p><p>As she was scanning the books on the bookshelf on the left of the room, she heard the door of the staff room close. She turned around and saw Billy come out of it.</p><p>“Rio, you’re back!” the boy exclaimed. “Why didn’t you visit the last two days?” he asked and went to his usual place at the counter. Rio was glad at the thought that the kid wanted her there, and the fact that he assumed that she’d just visit everyday. Glad to know that she’s welcome to the place.</p><p>“I was dying,” Rio exaggerated. She saw Agatha glancing at them, quietly listening to their conversation. “Just got the flu,” she said simply. She saw Agatha’s eyebrows quirk up as if she was relieved of what she heard.</p><p>Rio and Billy got into small talk, getting to know each other. This was the first time that they’ve talked like that. Perhaps that was because Rio was only focused on Agatha those past few days. But now, she appreciates the kid. Sometime in the middle of their conversation, Agatha went into the staff room. And after a few minutes, Agatha went back into the main room.</p><p>“Hey, emo kid,” Agatha called out from the door. Both of their heads turned to the location of the voice.</p><p>“I think she’s calling for you,” Rio directed to Billy, eyes still on Agatha.</p><p>“No, I’m teen in her vocabulary,” Billy replied.</p><p>“Why am I a kid?” she questioned Billy. “I’m older than you,” she continued.</p><p>Fed up by their little conversation and pointedly ignoring her call, Agatha removed herself from the door and went to the counter. She turned to look at Rio. “You’ve been here for half an hour, distracting my employee. Are you or are you not going to buy anything?” the other woman frustratingly says.</p><p>“I am, in fact, going to buy something,” Rio replied thoughtfully. She took a glance from the bookshelf nearest to her, and grabbed a random book. “I’m going to buy this,” Rio says as she gives Agatha the book without even giving it a look.</p><p>Agatha accepted the book, and observed it before asking, “You’re buying a book about the scandals of Henry the VIII?”</p><p>Rio almost comically snapped her head down to look at the book. It was indeed, a book about the King’s notorious doings. Well that was embarrassing, she thought. This was the second time that she was in this kind of situation. The power you have over me Agatha, Rio thinks.</p><p>“On second thought, I’m no longer buying that,” Rio replied, and picked the book up from Agatha’s hands. She gave it to Billy, making the boy return the book in her stead. Rio rested her elbows on the counter and crossed her arms, effectively getting closer to the brown-haired woman.</p><p>“Why don’t you recommend some books, hm?” Rio asked as the boy left the counter.</p><p>“You know, Rio,” Agatha started as she mimicked Rio’s position. “If you want to talk to me, you can just tell me,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio smiled uncontrollably. She removed her elbows from the counter and reached for her phone. She unlocked it and went to her contacts. She gave it to Agatha, who is now dumbfounded by the action.</p><p>“Your number,” Rio said simply.</p><p>Agatha scoffs at Rio’s words, but enters her number anyway. After doing so, Rio plucked the phone from the woman’s hands, and started walking backwards to the door.</p><p>“I’ll call you,” Rio said as she raised her hand to her ear, imitating a phone. The last thing she saw before exiting the bookstore was Agatha at the counter, jaw wide open at her audacity.</p><p>Rio doesn’t call. She didn’t want to cross Agatha’s boundary, they don’t know each other that much yet. But, Rio was determined to change that. Now, Agatha’s phone probably rang more than it did before - Rio sent her messages every hour of the day when she wasn’t able to visit the bookstore. Agatha does reply to some of her texts. But most of the time, it took minutes, or even hours before she replied. Rio’s okay with that. She’s content with even a single reply a day. She still visits the bookstore after all.</p><p>Rio decides to abort her mission to look into Agatha’s thread without consent. She respects Agatha’s privacy. And it seems like her little heart wouldn’t be able to handle it, seeing Agatha’s partner and finally realizing that she does have one. Over the course of three weeks, their relationship grew exponentially. Agatha finally showed friendliness to her, sometimes, she was sweet too.</p><p>They talk about the little things in their life. Rio sends her updates on her little plants - she comes to know that Agatha is fond of purple flowers. Must be her favorite flower, Rio figured. And so, every time she visits the bookstore, she always has a flower in hand. She tried to control her smile when she saw that Agatha keeps them in a box like a collection.</p><p>In turn, Agatha frequently talks about the books she was reading, as well as the books she loves. Rio didn’t take her as a bookworm, but apparently she can already be considered a bookreptile.</p><p>She literally celebrated with Jen, Alice and Lilia when Agatha mentioned that she was into women as well. She treated them to dinner at a fancy restaurant. And that’s when they come to know of her whole situation with Agatha.</p><p>Conversations upon conversations, their messages evolved into updates for one another. They tell each other the goodmornings and goodnights everyday. They send each other pictures of their meals. They just kept updating one another with their daily activities. The same goes when they’re spending time personally. Rio would often bring food to the bookstore, and they’ll have a little ‘friendly date.’ She hangs out at the place whenever she has free time. But they never go outside the bookstore. Rio can see it very clearly, it was a boundary.</p><p>Billy calls them ‘very close friends.’ But Rio knows that there’s something more to it. Billy probably knows of her feelings for Agatha. She’s made it very obvious, and Agatha must’ve intentionally ignored it.</p><p>She likes Agatha. And she’s falling hard.</p><p>One day, she was hanging out at the bookstore with Agatha late at night. She was telling her an interesting story about a client, confidentiality be damned.</p><p>“How does it really work, Rio?” Agatha questioned, curiosity in her voice. She never really told Agatha about her ability. There’s the possibility that Agatha will think that she’s delirious. And it’s understandable to think that.</p><p>Rio decided, it’s time to tell Agatha the truth. To support what she’s about to say, Rio brings out her phone, and opens her browser to show Agatha their reviews. Agatha was confused by the action, and so Rio explains.</p><p>“These are real reviews of our work, Lilia’s and mine.”</p><p>“There's thousands of them, Rio, and all say your readings are successful?” Agatha tries to confirm, staring intently at Rio.</p><p>“Yes. That’s because we have an ability,” Rio says. Her voice was full of vulnerability, her eyes unfocused. She was beyond terrified of what Agatha was going to say. Only Alice and Jen knew of their abilities. They found it hard to believe at first, but when their own readings and others’ came into fruition, they were convinced.</p><p>“Ability?” Agatha replied. Rio couldn’t get a hint of her emotions from Agatha’s tone. That made her even more terrified.</p><p>“I can see the red thread of fate, Lilia can see other’s most important future,” Rio successfully voiced out, voice breaking. She looked down at her clasped hands to avoid looking at Agatha.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio heard.</p><p>“You think I’m crazy.” It wasn’t a question, Rio said it as a fact.</p><p>“No, no,” Agatha replied. She saw Agatha place a hand on hers’.</p><p>She finally looked up. Agatha didn’t look at her like she was crazy. Her face was full of understanding.</p><p>“I don't think you are,” Agatha tried to soothe Rio. “I just,” she thought for a moment. “I need time to wrap my head around the idea. Besides, a lot of books say something about your ability. They may be folklores, but they wouldn’t be if they weren’t somehow based on reality, or at least an idea.”</p><p>Hearing those words from Agatha, hearing such validation, brought tears to Rio’s eyes. She laughed sadly as they trickled down her cheeks.</p><p>“Com’ere,” Agatha says as she stands up from her chair to the couch Rio was sitting on. She wrapped her arms around Rio and rubbed her back. Rio placed her arms around Agatha’s waist, finding comfort from the woman.</p><p>After her breakdown, Agatha gave her water to drink. She composed herself to look even a little bit presentable after what just happened.</p><p>“Can you read me too?” Agatha asks after Rio had fully recovered.</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio answered. She doesn’t want to tell Agatha about her torn thread. It might hurt her. “I - it’s complicated,” she continued.</p><p>“Try me,” Agatha challenged. “I’m stronger than you think.”</p><p>Rio smiled as Agatha lightened the mood. She took a deep breath before replying, “Yours is torn.”</p><p>Agatha went silent, and Rio observed her face. It contorted to a shock, and Rio couldn’t take it, so she tried to comfort the woman.</p><p>“I think it’s temporary. It’s mendable. It has to be,” she says.</p><p>Agatha tried to smile at the consolation, but the smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. Her expression shows that she’s given up. Perhaps, she already did a long time ago.</p><p>“How about you? Where’s your soulmate?” Agatha changed the topic, seemingly wanting to move on from her sensitive one. The way Agatha says it though, it was as if she was carefully stepping into a dangerous territory, almost as if she was bracing herself for her answer.</p><p>Rio let out a bitter laugh. “I don’t have one,” she says, voice enveloped with sadness. “It’s the cost of my ability.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t able to register what happened afterwards. What she remembers was Agatha’s comforting embrace and presence. But, she slept peacefully that night knowing that Agatha chose to believe in her. However, she knew that there was still a hesitation in Agatha’s mind. Well, who the hell would even believe those things as soon as they heard it, right? So the next day, she decides to ask if Billy would want to have a reading. Just to prove her ability to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha and Billy were doing their usual tasks at the counter. Rio couldn’t even be bothered to know what. Paperworks and she don’t get along, that’s why they have Jen.</p><p>“Hey Billy,” Rio started. “Do you want me to read you?”</p><p>Billy’s head immediately snapped up to look at Rio. But then, hesitation showed on his face.</p><p>“I don’t know, I’m saving up for college and-“</p><p>She didn’t let Billy finish. “It’s free.”</p><p>This time, it was Agatha who looked up, curious at them.</p><p>“Really? Right here? Right now?” Billy asks quite excitedly.</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t have clients for the day.”</p><p>Rio then gestured to the couch, indicating that they’ll do the reading there. Rio sat on the couch, and Billy sat on the chair opposite it. Agatha followed them, standing beside Billy’s chair, placing her hand on top of the backrest. She just watched them, not saying anything. Rio explained their conditions; she will have a look first, and if the person was suitable for him - not a murderer or whatever, Rio encountered a few of them - she’ll tell him his partner’s identity.</p><p>Billy nodded enthusiastically, probably not listening to Rio’s words due to excitement. She reached for his right hand, and interlaced their fingers. She focused on her mind, and then she felt the pull. She slowly let herself drift into the feeling of the thread. But midway, she was interrupted by Billy.</p><p>“So, who is it?” Billy asked.</p><p>Dude has no chill.</p><p>“I’m not done, let me focus,” Rio sternly replied. Billy muttered an apologetic sorry, and Rio decided to delve once again. She saw his partner. He has tanned skin, and hair similar to Billy’s locks. His name was Eddie, and he lived in the town next to them. She told Billy what she saw, and the teen decided to look for him the next day.</p><p>And so, the day after that next day, Agatha and Rio’s ear was this close to bursting from Billy’s yapping about his first meeting with Eddie, and how they instantly clicked. Rio watched Agatha as she listened (begrudgingly) to the teen. She can see it on Agatha’s face, the look of realizing that it was true, that her ability was true. It’s not like she can just conjure a person and their bond, right?</p><p>That day after that, Rio felt a shift in the air. She was hanging out at the bookstore as usual after work, reading a book she found interesting on the couch. She can see - no, she can feel - Agatha’s intense gaze on her. It wasn’t a hostile or malicious kind of look, it was more like she was dredging over thin ice, meaning to do something with Rio. And when Billy went home for the night, Agatha sat in front of her. Rio turned to look at Agatha, her eyes piercing through her soul.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha started. “I want you to read me. I can pay - just read me. Please,” she continued. Is that desperation lacing her voice?</p><p>To say that Rio was taken aback would be an understatement, she was shocked at the request, which was more of a command. She tries to think of a reason why Agatha wanted to be read. Does she want to meet her partner already, or does she just want to prove something?</p><p>“Why?” Rio manages to let out, though only barely. She likes Agatha too much, too much that her heart wouldn’t be able to handle the pain. It must have been one sided all along, she realized. Agatha still wanted to be with the one she was destined with.</p><p>“I just need to know,” Agatha said, voice devoid of any emotion. She was an expert at that - hiding her feelings whenever necessary.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, defeated.</p><p>Rio sat up on the couch properly, bringing the book she was reading down. She stretched her hand, and Agatha gave her her right hand. Rio interlaced their fingers. It was the first time they held hands like this, and it broke Rio’s heart due to the fact that they were holding hands only for Rio to give her to another person.</p><p>The flowing that she felt within the thread was short. When she came to a stop, it was only black. She suddenly felt a sharp stab on her head, feeling like she was going to die just from that. And as if that wasn’t enough, she felt like her heart was being squeezed tightly, and then she heard the voices.</p><p>“But I love you!” Rio heard a voice she recognized as Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m sorry.” It was another woman’s voice, one she did not recognize.</p><p>“I don’t love you like that. I can’t love you like that,” the woman continued.</p><p>“And I don’t think you can give me the love I deserve. You can’t give anyone the love they deserve.”</p><p>The voices stopped, and what was left was Agatha’s heart wrenching cries. She felt every emotion that Agatha felt. The pain, the heartbreak, the hopelessness. The thread thought that that wasn’t enough as another voice rang through her head. This time, it was one of an older woman.</p><p>“You’re not my blood, my flesh. You can never be a daughter of mine. Nothing good will come out of your life. Sin has followed you from the day you were born. You were born evil.”</p><p>“Mother, please, I can be good.” It was the younger voice of Agatha.</p><p>The painful emotions heightened. The pain that Agatha felt for years, she all felt for mere seconds. Her body couldn’t handle it, mentally and physically. Then, everything came to a stop. She collapsed.</p><p>While drifting in her unconsciousness, she was able to organize her thoughts. Rio understood now, the reason her thread was torn - she will never love again. Rio knew the power of the thread. The meaning behind them. If the thread is red, people will inevitably be drawn to each other. If the thread is black, people will not love anybody as much as they love or will love their partner. And if the thread is torn? The person might never love again. Agatha won’t give love another chance, even if it’s with her. Rio doesn’t know why she felt like this for Agatha, like she wants to surrender the world for her. But she knew one thing. If Agatha cannot be hers’, she doesn’t want to wake up.</p><p>She woke up desperately gasping for air, like she was drowning all this time. She abruptly sat up, but she felt a pair of hands on her shoulder pushing her back lightly. Refocusing her eyes, she saw that Agatha was sitting on her left. Her eyes scanned the area, she was in a bed in what looked like Agatha’s bedroom.</p><p>Breathing heavily, she asked, “Where?”</p><p>“Breathe, Rio,” Agatha instructed as she stared at Rio, indicating that she focus on her eyes.</p><p>Rio returned the gaze and nodded. After stabilizing her breathing, Agatha answered.</p><p>“You’re in my room. You suddenly collapsed, Rio, what happened?” The question was full of concern.</p><p>Rio recalled the events earlier. Agatha told her to read her, she reached out for her hand, then the darkness, the voices, the silence. Agatha must’ve carried her upstairs to her flat above the bookstore.</p><p>“Give me a moment,” Rio replied.</p><p>Thankfully, Agatha understood her vague sentence and nodded. Rio needed time to organize her thoughts and let her body relax. The pain that she felt was no joke. She really felt like she’s about to meet her creator soon.</p><p>“I’ll get you something to eat. There’s water on the table if you need it,” Agatha says as she leaves the bedroom.</p><p>Rio repositioned herself in the bed, leaning her back against the headboard. She felt her throat itch, so she went ahead and grabbed the glass, and downed it in one go. She closes her eyes, and relaxes her body.</p><p>She must’ve fallen asleep since as she opened her eyes once again, the room smelled of delicious food. Agatha was back in the room, holding a plate of what seemed to be arroz con gandules, and another glass of water. Rio couldn't control the large grin that krept its way to her face. Agatha remembered her favorite, despite only mentioning it once during one of their calls.</p><p>“I didn’t know you could cook that,” Rio said amused and happy.</p><p>“I’ve been practicing it. I wanted to cook it for you one day,” Agatha replied without giving eye contact. There was a light blush on her cheeks. “I guess this is the day.”</p><p>“Well, it’s an honor to eat the food the great Agatha Harkness has provided,” Rio replied dramatically. She received a light chuckle from the woman.</p><p>Rio grabbed the plate from Agatha’s hand, and the latter took a seat beside her. Rio excitedly took the first bite, and when her tongue registered the taste, it literally melted. It was so good, so good that she let out a moan of satisfaction. Agatha chuckled at the sound, which Rio’s cheeks replied with a blush. Rio continued to finish her food, and Agatha just watched her the whole time with adoration in her eyes. Rio downed the last bite with water that Agatha gave her. After settling in, Agatha gave her a look of anticipation. She wanted the answers right now, and Rio was ready to give it.</p><p>“So,” Rio started, averting her gaze from Agatha to her clasped hands at her lap. “I didn’t see anyone.” She only heard a soft gasp from Agatha as she still refused to look at her.</p><p>“It was black. I’ve only heard voices. It was from a woman you loved. The one who didn’t accept it.” This time, Rio looked up to see Agatha’s reaction. Her gaze was empty, and it hurt Rio.</p><p>“There was also the voice of an older woman. She said you were born,” Rio paused, bracing herself for Agatha’s reaction. “Evil,” she whispered. “You sworn to never love again, didn’t you?”</p><p>This time, a tear trickled down Agatha’s left cheek. Rio instantly places her hands on Agatha’s cheeks softly, and wiped the single tear with her thumb. She saw that Agatha looked at her with such devastation.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands wrapped around her wrists, and squeezed them tightly. Then, trails of tears came gushing down. Agatha was sobbing, and all Rio could do was give her comfort. And so, she grabbed the back of Agatha’s head, and directed it to her shoulder. She wraps her other hand around Agatha’s back.</p><p>Agatha’s sobs died down after a few moments. When Agatha removed her head from Rio’s shoulder, she looked at her eyes. Her eyes had this look of desire in it. Rio couldn’t place it, but it tells her to do something. Agatha then places her hands on Rio’s cheeks this time. Rio thought she understood the look on the woman’s eyes - longing for intimacy- so she leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>Upon realizing what Rio was about to do, Agatha slid her hands down to Rio’s shoulders, and almost violently pushed her back. Did she misunderstand the situation? Or did Agatha only change her mind at the last second? Rio kept these questions at bay as Agatha opened her mouth to speak.</p><p>“We can’t do this,” Agatha said hurriedly. “I don’t - I can’t love you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw sadly opened at what the woman said, feeling a searing pain in her chest. Impulsively, she tore herself from Agatha and practically ran out of the room. Since it was Rio’s first time in the place, she had to look for the stairs. Talk about an anticlimactic exit. Upon locating it, she went down, grabbed her things, and dashed out the door of the bookstore. Agatha didn’t even stop her, didn’t even follow her. She felt her world collapsing on her.</p><p>It’s been a week since the last time Rio saw Agatha. She no longer visited the bookstore. And she ignored Agatha’s every attempt to communicate with her through the phone. She didn’t want to put a distance between them, but she knows that if she sees Agatha again, her heart will break into pieces.</p><p>Rio was sitting at her office’s desk when she heard a knock on the door. She knew that it can either be Alice or Jen since it’s past work hours. Lilia had gone home earlier, exhausted from her multiple readings. After another knock, she told the person to come in. The opened door revealed the couple, with matching faces filled with concern.</p><p>“Rio, how are you doing? Are you okay?” Alice asked.</p><p>For the whole week, it looked like Rio was at rock bottom, as they said. Her energy, her smile, her vibrant personality were nowhere to be found. Rio tried to act like she was okay, and tried to go on with work as usual. But, she can’t fool anyone. How will one act normally when their world just fell apart?</p><p>Met with an absence of an answer, Jen added, “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Rio hasn’t told anyone about the real reason she was so dejected this past week, not even Lilia. She can’t just bring herself to say it out loud, because that will make it true. But now deciding to face the truth, she’ll tell them what really happened.</p><p>When Rio finally acknowledged them and gave out a laugh, Jen brought her hands into view, which were hidden behind her back. In her hands were cans of beer and takeout.</p><p>“We have beer, so pour your heart out,” Jen said.</p><p>And that she did. Rio told them about telling Agatha their powers, her reading with Billy, and her reading with Agatha. She didn’t tell them about what she heard from Agatha’s memory though, it wasn’t hers to disclose. She ended the story by telling them how Agatha rejected her. The couple comforted her and did everything they could to lighten the atmosphere. That saved Rio’s eyes from another round of breakdown. Rio was very grateful to them, they always manage to help her up whenever she becomes down. They’re the friends everyone could ever wish for.</p><p>The couple bid their goodbyes to Rio when the clock struck 9 o'clock. However, after  a few seconds, Alice came back up and gave Rio a look of surprise.</p><p>“Rio,” she started. This gathered Rio’s whole attention.</p><p>“Agatha’s downstairs. Waiting for you,” she finished.</p><p>Rio’s mind entered a state of panic. She didn’t know what to do - whether to send Agatha back or to finally face her this time. Before she could overthink her answer, she replied to Alice, “Can you, uh, send her upstairs?”</p><p>Deciding not to push further, Alice simply nodded and headed downstairs. Rio took the time to compose herself. She went to the mirror in her office and smoothed out her clothes. She brushed her hair with her hands to tame it, and rubbed her face with her hands as if to warm it up. Just right after she finished, she heard a single knock on the opened door of her office.</p><p>Agatha stood by the doorframe, covered in her purple coat. She stands there hesitantly, as if readying herself from Rio’s reaction.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said.</p><p>“Rio, please come back,” Agatha let out, voice pleaded.</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed at this. She looked visibly offended. After that rejection, she just wants for her to come back like nothing happened. When she opens her mouth to answer, Agatha interrupts her.</p><p>“I-” she muttered. “I know I’m being selfish but,” she said as she carefully and slowly walked closer to Rio. “I still want to spend time with you, Rio. It’s been a long time since I had someone like you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, and instead tried to look at Agatha to get an idea of what this will lead to.</p><p>“Can we talk?” Agatha pleaded.</p><p>Rio nodded, weak to Agatha’s words. “Let’s walk,” she said as she went out the door first, grabbing and putting on her coat on the way. Agatha followed, and they left the office. Rio took a moment to close the office before joining Agatha on the walk.</p><p>They walked side by side, each didn’t dare to break the silence. They’re already two blocks away from the office, but Rio still didn’t want to initiate this time. So, she just looked up at the sky and traced the stars as they walked.</p><p>“That woman you heard,” Agatha finally said. Rio turned her head to look at her.</p><p>“Was my best friend. Childhood best friend. I loved her for as long as I can remember.”</p><p>They came to a stop when they reached a bench. Agatha sat first and Rio followed, putting a good distance between them.</p><p>“I confessed, and she accepted it. We tried to make it work, but it didn’t in the end. She wasn’t happy the whole time we were together. She said it’s because she saw the real me. Damaged goods. Ruined by my mother.”</p><p>Rio connected all the dots by this time. Agatha was traumatized by the people who should’ve been important to her, who should’ve loved her. Remembering the emotions she felt when she was reading Agatha, she couldn’t help but feel guilt. It was probably a sensitive time for her and Rio decided to take advantage of that. And so, she reached out her hand to interlace it with Agatha’s. This made Agatha turn her head and give her a genuine smile.</p><p>“I should’ve been over this. It’s been fourteen years for god’s sake,” she spat out.</p><p>“Hey, no one can blame you,” Rio reassured. “I’ve felt all you’ve felt you know?”</p><p>Agatha shoots her a confused look.</p><p>“As I was reading you, and hearing those voices, all your emotions were inflicted on me. I felt like I was dying, and I know you felt that in those moments.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, and just traced circles with her thumb on their interlaced fingers. It seemed like she was preventing herself from talking so as not to break down once again. This time, Rio decides that it’s her turn to be vulnerable. She looks up to the sky once again, trying to get courage.</p><p>“I can’t love someone too,” Rio started. “I mean I tried to. But, knowing that they’ll eventually find the one they’re meant to be with, or that they’ll never love me truly, I never wanted to try again.”</p><p>Rio paused for a moment before dropping the bomb. “But, I wasn’t able to stop myself from loving you, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio let out a bittersweet laugh as she brought her gaze into Agatha’s blue eyes. There were tears forming from her eyes.</p><p>“I guess we’re both damaged goods,” Rio managed to say before Agatha closed the distance between them, their lips coming into contact. Agatha wrapped her hands around Rio’s cheeks and deepened the contact. Her lips were soft, so soft, Rio thought.</p><p>Rio, in turn, wrapped her hand around Agatha’s wrists. This was similar to a week ago, the only difference was that their positions were changed. As their lips began to move and taste each other, Rio unconsciously shred tears, falling on both of their cheeks.</p><p>Agatha pulled away, feeling the wetness from Rio’s cheeks. She looked at Rio with concern, and Rio only closed her eyes. When she opened them again, Agatha’s torn thread came into view. It was a bitter reminder that she will never be Agatha’s destined partner.</p><p>“Agatha, you have someone there for you,” Rio said, almost choking on her voice.</p><p>Agatha furiously shook her head in front of Rio’s. “No, no, no,” she pleaded.</p><p>“Please, let me go,” Rio replied, unintentionally raising her voice.</p><p>“I don’t give a shit about that red thread. I’ve already cut myself away from that person, Rio, I’m here with you,” Agatha tried to argue.</p><p>“Please,” Rio replied, desperation in her voice, not listening to Agatha’s words.</p><p>Seeing that Agatha would make no move to let her go, she forcefully peeled Agatha’s hands from her cheeks. She quickly got up and started walking briskly. She didn’t know where her feet were taking her, she just knows that she needs to get as far away as she can. Wasting no time, she heard Agatha’s footsteps. She felt Agatha’s presence getting closer, and then she felt a hand wrap around her wrist, yanking her backwards. It was as if they were reenacting their first encounter. It’s funny how fate works. How it punishes Rio.</p><p>Without letting go of her hand, Rio was turned to face Agatha. She felt Agatha’s warm hand against her cheek once again. Rio looked down out of spite.</p><p>“Baby, look at me,” Agatha instructs Rio. With her teary eyes, Rio did as she was told.</p><p>“I’ll choose you over and over again,” Agatha continues. “I’ll choose you over everything, Rio, please, give me a chance. Give us a chance.”</p><p>It was Agatha’s eyes’ turn to water. Rio, surrendering herself to her wants and briefly telling fate to fuck off, nodded enthusiastically. Pulling her arm from Agatha’s grip, she placed both hands on Agatha’s jaw and pulled her into a kiss.</p><p>They let themselves both melt into the kiss, pouring all their emotions, all their love into it. They were surrendering themselves to each other. And the world outside them started to fade. It was just the two of them, savoring one another.</p><p>Rio suddenly felt warmth around her right hand’s pinky finger. And as seconds passed, it felt like it was being burned. This made her pull away from Agatha, dropping her hand in pain, and she turned her head down to look at the hand. Agatha let out a small gasp, surprised by the action.</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was seeing. A red thread was being wrapped around her finger, which continues to lengthen. It flew into the air, towards Agatha’s thread. The threads weaved together and connected. And it glowed the brightest red she had ever seen.</p><p>She turned her head back up to look at Agatha. She had a similar reaction to Rio, and her eyes were also looking at where their threads had connected.</p><p>“I see it, Rio, I see it,” she exclaimed. Agatha saw the thread, but it was gone in a moment. But that was enough for her.</p><p>Rio brought Agatha into an embrace, burying her head at the nook of her neck.</p><p>“I love you, Agatha,” she whispers.</p><p>“I love you, Rio,” Agatha whispers back.</p><p>They pulled away and looked into each other’s eyes. Rio smiled lovingly at the woman who was now her destiny.</p><p>“You’re mine, Agatha,” she says to the woman in front of her. “And, I’m yours,” she continued.</p><p>“I’ll be with you for as long as I live, my love,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Without any more words, they pulled each other to a kiss.</p><p>Beyond all odds, they become each other’s destiny, perhaps it’s because of her ability and their wishes. The only thing that matters to Rio is that she’ll be in Agatha’s arms, and Agatha’s in hers for as long as they live. They’re now each other’s destined after all.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Just for clarification and answer to the plothole, Agatha’s string really connected to Rio. But, she swore on not loving again before Rio started to see the threads. It was when Wanda rejected her and her mother traumatized her (the one Rio saw), which was 14 years ago. Rio was only 14 at that time so she didn’t know she had a red thread all this time. Agatha was able to tear their thread due to her strong conviction, and since her destined was special, it gave her a miniscule of Rio’s ability; hence, she had the power to tear it. The fact that Rio didn’t have the torn thread was just fate’s doing, it was cruel to Rio (since she was already granted the ability - it’s kind of like a balance). I didn’t see the need to incorporate it into the story, as it would make it more romantic if they didn’t know about this. They would always believe that they chose one another, and it wasn’t just up to fate.</p><p>Anyway, thank you for reading!</p></blockquote>
