<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“Where do you go?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head to look up at Agatha, using her hand to shield her eyes from the midday sun to see her better. When her eyes adjusted she noticed Agatha’s furrowed brow and the way her lips were pressed into a thin line. Rio had found her alone in the meadow, as she so often did, sitting on her blanket with her knees pulled to her chest. She’d greeted Rio with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, but accepted the kiss Rio offered nonetheless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to ask what had put her in such a sour mood, but knew that any attempt to nudge Agatha into talking about what was bothering her, no matter how gently, would only be met with snappish remarks and empty assurances that she was fine. Agatha had a tendency to retreat into herself and brood. So, Rio left her to her thoughts, instead laying at her side and watching the clouds float by across the bright blue sky, content to wait out her silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio hummed in question.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where do you go?” Agatha repeated. “When you’re not here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth, but immediately snapped it shut again. She had no answer for her that wasn’t the full truth of who she was and Rio wasn’t sure that was something she was ready for Agatha to know. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My home,” she answered evasively, knowing full well that the likelihood of Agatha accepting it was nonexistent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned and shook her head. “You’re lying.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and slowly pushed herself to sit upright. She was stalling, searching for an answer to satisfy Agatha’s curiosity, but coming up short. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio asked instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her gaze, drawing her knees closer to her chest as her arms tightened around them. Rio watched as she swallowed and cleared her throat, clearly fighting with her instinct to close herself off. Rio reached out a tentative hand and placed it on Agatha’s arm. When she didn’t pull away, Rio gave her a gentle, encouraging squeeze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to go with you,” Agatha muttered after a long stretch of silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes and slowly withdrew her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she whispered, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Every fiber of her being longed to give in to Agatha’s soft request. Against the whole of Rio’s sprawling existence, the time she’d known Agatha was but a second. Despite that, and to Rio’s utter surprise, Agatha had managed to wind her way into her heart and take root there. The thought of having Agatha by her side until the end of time was almost too tempting to resist. But Agatha had no idea what she was asking and Rio wasn’t sure if she’d still want that if she knew the whole truth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d known each other close to two years and Agatha hadn’t pried too much into Rio’s life outside of the bubble they created every time they met. She’d wanted to, Rio could sense as much every time she let the slightest piece of information slip, but never pressed her for more. But she always got this look on her face and Rio could practically see the wheels turning in her head, trying to put together a puzzle she didn’t yet have all the pieces to. Countless times, Rio wanted to tell her everything, bare her entire soul to the woman she loved with her whole heart, but she held her tongue for fear of Agatha turning her back on her. Because what mortal would willingly embrace Death?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Agatha asked, her voice taking on a desperate edge. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and met Agatha’s eyes again, the tears she saw glistening there making her heart break a little. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that simple,” Rio started, but Agatha’s scoff cut her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then explain it to me,” she said through clenched teeth, the muscles in her jaw jumping from the tension.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can try,” Rio conceded, her heart beating furiously in her chest. “But I can’t promise you’ll feel the same once you know the truth.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her arms fall from around her knees and turned to face Rio more fully, giving her her full attention. Rio swallowed around the lump that formed in her throat, taking a moment to collect her thoughts. While she knew that the truth would have to come out eventually, she’d never given much thought to how she’d go about explaining her role in the natural order. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re afraid,” Agatha said softly when Rio remained silent for too long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a question and Rio wondered when she’d let herself become so easy to read before coming to the realization that Agatha had single handedly chipped away at the thick walls around herself. Even still, letting the last one fall was proving much more difficult, the only one she was still clinging to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am,” Rio admitted honestly, but afraid didn’t fully encompass how terrified she felt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought alone was laughable. Fear was such a human emotion and the idea of being rejected by Agatha was enough to inspire the feeling in Death herself. She was so far gone for this woman, more than she’d ever imagined possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it so horrible?” Agatha questioned, bringing her hand up to cup Rio’s cheek, her thumb gently stroking back and forth in the way that never failed to make Rio melt. “This truth you’ve been hiding from me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned into her touch and took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she said with a small shake of her head. “But not everyone sees it the way that I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because it wasn’t shame that was keeping her from revealing herself fully to Agatha, but her own reluctance to lose her. Death was just a part of the natural cycle of life, yet those who were acutely aware of their mortality had warped her image into something to be feared. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re afraid I’ll see you as they do?” Agatha deduced, understanding reflected in her blue eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, the corner of her mouth lifted in a small smile. “I don’t think I could bear it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her thumb still lightly stroking Rio’s cheek. She leaned in and Rio met her half way, accepting the short kiss she brushed against her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you’ll find I can be more understanding than most,” she whispered against Rio’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The truth of Agatha’s words washed over Rio and her last wall crumbled. If anyone was going to understand or at the very least try, it was going to be Agatha. Her own mother feared the power she wielded as if she’d had a choice in what magic she was born with. Her own coven shunned her from the craft because they were afraid of what she might do with that power. Agatha was intimately familiar with being seen as a monster. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope so,” Rio said, leaning in to steal another chaste kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you tell me now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached up and took Agatha’s hand in hers, pulling it from her cheek and placing a kiss on her palm. Agatha turned her hand over to thread her fingers through Rio’s and gave her a reassuring squeeze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and offered a small smile. “I can show you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed, but remained silent as Rio took a steadying breath. She closed her eyes, despite her new found confidence that Agatha wouldn’t immediately turn tail and run for the hills. She called forth her magic and slowly retracted the illusion of the form she’d chosen to walk among mortals. She heard Agatha’s soft gasp as her skeletal features were revealed, but Agatha’s grip on her hand remained firm. Despite that reassurance, Rio kept her eyes closed even after the thrum of her magic retreated. She felt Agatha’s pulse race beneath her fingertips and held her breath as she waited for her to say something, anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please look at me,” she finally begged after several long beats of silence hung between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Rio blinked her eyes open and was immediately met with Agatha’s piercing eyes staring into her very core. As promised, she found understanding in her gaze as the pieces began to fall into place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Green magic?” Agatha questioned with a tilt of her head. “Growth and decay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “The cycle of all living things.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at the sound of Rio’s voice unmasked before she let out a soft chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The original Green Witch,” she said, shaking her head. “Death personified.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The one and only,” Rio agreed with a light chuckle of her own. She felt all the tension seep from her body in that moment as she watched Agatha’s eyes take in every inch of her form. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not nearly as terrifying as the stories make you seem,” she said thoughtfully, her eyes meeting Rio’s again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Rio asked, her skeletal jaw unable to express the smirk in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head and bit down on her bottom lip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You spent an entire afternoon conjuring up any flower I could name,” she said with another soft giggle. “It really diminishes the image of Death as a being to be feared.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears welled in Rio’s eyes and her heart swelled with love for this beautiful woman she was lucky enough to get to call hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile widened and she lifted the hand that wasn’t holding Rio’s, letting it hover in the space between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“May I?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and sat completely still as Agatha’s fingertips brushed along the bone of her jaw. She watched Agatha’s face as she ran her fingers over her cheek bones before moving lower over her throat before she stopped at her breast bone and pressed her palm there. Her eyes met Rio’s once again, soft and so full of love that it stole the breath from her lungs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This doesn’t change anything,” she said with enough conviction in her voice to chase away any lingering doubt Rio might have had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You amaze me.” The words tumbled out of Rio’s mouth before she could think better of such a bold admission, but Agatha only continued to beam beside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes fell to where her lips should have been and for a brief moment disappointment colored her features. In a blink Rio shifted back into the form Agatha had become so familiar with. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That might take some getting used to,” Agatha admitted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can have all the time you need,” Rio promised her. “As long as you’re with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes dropped to where her hand was still pressed against Rio’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still wish I could go with you,” she whispered, the smile on her lips faltering slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio covered Agatha’s hand on her chest, tilting her head to try and catch her eye. “Me too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t stay here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew how much Agatha loathed her mother and her coven, but there was a small part of her that held out hope that they would one day embrace her as one of their own. That’s why she stayed, even if she’d never admit it out loud. Rio had imagined whisking Agatha away from it all to an imagined cottage in the woods where they could be happy together, but it was a selfish dream. Agatha hadn’t expressed any real desire to escape the only home she’d ever known until today. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have a place for us yet,” Rio started tentatively, “but if I did, you’d leave this place behind?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Without a second thought,” Agatha answered with no hesitation, her hand squeezing Rio’s tightly as new hope shined in her eyes. “I just want to be with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It could be lonely,” Rio warned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to know that Agatha fully understood what she was agreeing to. Rio was bound to the constant flow of nature and that meant that she couldn’t always be there with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No more than it is now,” Agatha countered, moving her hand from Rio’s chest to caress her cheek again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her heart hammering against her ribs. “Okay, when I return, we’ll go together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha surged forward, capturing Rio’s lips in a kiss that left her breathless. When she pulled away, she pressed her forehead against Rio’s and closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” she breathed out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was momentarily speechless. It was the first time either of them had dared to utter those three words out loud. Rio knew that’s what she’d been feeling for a while now, but she’d been afraid it was too soon. It shouldn’t have surprised her that Agatha was the one to say it first, after all she’d been the one to initiate their first kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, too,” she said and punctuated her promise with another short kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When will you return?” Agatha asked, leaning back with her hands still on Rio’s cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and tucked a stray hair behind her ear. “Nightfall?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at the suggestion, but Rio could almost feel her excitement rolling off of her in waves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So soon?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As long as you’re sure?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, dislodging the hair that Rio had just tucked out of her face. “I’m sure,” she said, her voice never wavering, her eyes locked on Rio’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but chuckle as she moved her hands to caress Agatha’s wrists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said. “I have to go, but I will be back here for you just as soon as the sun sets.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I will be waiting,” Agatha promised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and squeezed Agatha’s wrists once more before she let her hands fall away reluctantly. Agatha dropped her hands with one last stroke of her thumb against Rio’s cheek. With a sigh, she gathered up the cloak she’d shed when she arrived. When she she stood and slung the cloak around her shoulders, Agatha’s hand caught her wrist and pulled her back down. Rio raised an eyebrow in question and Agatha only smiled up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One more kiss,” she said, already leaning in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything for you, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bent and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s forehead and another one on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like the sound of that,” Agatha said as Rio straightened back up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked as Agatha’s hand slipped from her wrist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will see you tonight,” she promised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned up at her, her entire demeanor a stark contrast to how Rio had found her. It filled her with an excitement for what the future held for her and Agatha like she’d never felt before. Rio was aware that their time together would come to an end eventually, but she was looking forward to all of the time that they had in the meantime. Rio had tried for centuries to understand why so many clung to their mortality without even an inkling as to what came next in the cycle of life. But being with Agatha, the love and happiness that suffused her simply from being in Agatha’s presence, maybe Death was beginning to understand what it meant to live.</span>
