      "Ms. Vidal stood up to look at Agatha, giving Agatha a view of her deep brown eyes. “I’m guessing you’re Mrs. Harkness?” She asked, an eyebrow raised.
      <br/>
      “Ms. Harkness,” Agatha corrected. She reached a hand out to shake the teacher’s hand, trying to keep her mind off of how soft it was."

<p>
<span>
      Another summer gone and it was school time once again, a reminder that the time flew faster than Agatha would like. She had adopted her son Nicholas when he was an infant, raising him as a single mother. She had always wanted to be a mother and by the time she turned 35 and still had no hope for a real relationship, she decided it was time to go for it anyway, which turned out to be the best decision she’s ever made. Nicky was her pride and joy and knowing he was about to start his first year of Kindergarten tugged at her heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Said little ball of energy was bouncing on his toes at the door, waiting for Agatha to grab the keys to take him to school, which she clearly was taking too long at for his standards. His first official day of school started tomorrow, but tonight the school had an open house so the kids can meet their teachers and get familiar with the school layout.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma, come onnn,” he said excitedly, tugging at her purple dress pants she still had on from work. She couldn’t help but to smile at his excitement, hoping it would remain once he actually started school.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m coming, I’m coming,” she chuckled, reaching down to ruffle his brown curls affectionately. She grabbed the keys and picked him up to carry him to the car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re getting a bit heavy for this, bud,” she joked, shifting him to her hip to free her hand as she shut and locked the door. “Soon you’re going to be big enough to drive yourself!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky laughed as Agatha buckled him into his car seat. “I can’t drive yet! You’re funny, Mamma.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Sure, he technically wouldn’t be driving for another 10 years, but the way time passed since she adopted him, she knew this day would feel like it just happened once he got to that point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The drive didn’t take very long, thank goodness, because Nicky’s latest fixation was on the Coco soundtrack. Sure, it was good the first few times, but after hearing Un Poco Loco for the hundredth time she herself felt un poco loco.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha parked the car and helped Nicky out of his seat, holding onto his hand as they walked into the building. She immediately knew he was enthralled, his eyes glancing in various directions as he noticed different things and people.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were led to the cafeteria where the rest of the parents and children were milling about, waiting to be directed to their children’s respective teachers when Nicky let go of Agatha’s hand and immediately darted off with an enthusiastic shout. “Billy and Tommy!” he exclaimed, running over to his twin friends whom he practically grew up with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha put her hands in her pant pockets and walked over to where Nicky had run, Wanda chuckling at the children’s excitement. “You’d think they didn’t already know they were going to go to school together,” Agatha said as she approached the red head, her eyes full of mirth as she watched the kids talk excitedly together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s hope their memories work better once school starts,” Wanda replied, a grin on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was about to respond when a man stood at the front of the cafeteria, clapping to get everyone’s attention. “Hello everyone! I’m excited to see so many happy faces! We’re happy to have you here for our open house. Parents, if you could form a line at the table, we’ll get you the list of teachers your kiddos will have this year and you’re free to go and meet them.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky quickly ran to grab Agatha’s hand and dragged her to the line, excited to meet his teachers. Agatha went along with it, shooting Wanda a look that said ‘what can I do?’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soon enough, Agatha received the list, her eyes scanning the page for room numbers. “Okay, looks like you have Mrs. Romanoff as your main teacher. We should probably go see her first and then the specials teachers, alright?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded enthusiastically and that was that. They went to the room number listed and met the teacher, a woman who looked a little younger than Agatha and had a kind smile. She showed Nicky around to the cubby where he would put his backpack and had him look around for the table that had his name tag. She had moved on to another student and their parents, leaving Nicky back with Agatha, eager to meet the other teachers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, let’s see. There’s art, Spanish, library, and gym. Where do you want to go first?” She asked, her eyes scanning the paper. Honestly she didn’t need to ask, knowing he'd immediately choose Spanish once he heard her say it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She took Nicky’s hand and led him to the room, her eyes scanning the decorations of the alphabet in spanish letters, posters of various Spanish speaking countries, and, oh god, a replica of the guitar from Coco which of course Nicky immediately noticed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ernesto de la Cruz’s guitar!” he shouted, running towards it. Agatha followed him quickly, shouting after him, “careful! We don’t know if your teacher wants people to touch it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she approached her son, a low chuckle sounded behind her. “A fellow Coco fan, huh?” the voice asked. Agatha turned around to see a dark haired woman dressed in a green jumpsuit that hugged her curves so well. If Wanda were here, she’d clock Agatha immediately, knowing this woman was absolutely her type.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The woman bent down to Nicky’s level, holding out a hand to him. “I’m Ms.Vidal. What’s your name?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky grabbed Vidal’s hand with both of his tiny hands and shook it, eliciting a chuckle from the teacher. “I’m Nicholas Harkness, but Mamma calls me Nicky,” he replied happily. “You like Coco? What’s your favorite song?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm, I’d say La Llorona. My madre used to sing that to me when I was your age,” she grinned, still at Nicky’s level.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My Mamma doesn’t like singing the songs with me. She said they’re annoying,” Nicky replied openly in a way only a 6 year-old can.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face reddened slightly in embarrassment as she shook her head. “I’d like them more if you listened to anything else besides the album.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ms. Vidal stood up to look at Agatha, giving Agatha a view of her deep brown eyes. “I’m guessing you’re Mrs. Harkness?” She asked, an eyebrow raised.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Harkness,” Agatha corrected. She reached a hand out to shake the teacher’s hand, trying to keep her mind off of how soft it was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm lo siento, querida,” Vidal responded. Agatha made a mental note to google what that meant later. “Nice to meet you both.” She let go of Agatha’s hand and took a step back. “Are you excited for tomorrow, Nicky? I have something special planned for our first day.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky grinned wide and shook his head in the positive. “What is it?” He asked eagerly, causing Vidal to chuckle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll have to wait to find out,” she grinned, Agatha’s eyes noticing how nice her smile was. Wow, she really needed to get laid. “I’ll let you go to meet the other teachers. I look forward to seeing you in class tomorrow.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky’s smile never left his face as he followed Agatha out of the room and to the rest of the other classes. It was clear his enthusiasm from earlier today remained, if not growing stronger after seeing the school and his teachers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tucked Nicky into bed later that night, kissing his forehead as he whispered a sleepy “g’night.” Agatha smiled softly, mentally taking a photo of the moment to remember forever. She didn’t know what she’d be doing in life if she hadn’t adopted him, but she knew it would never be as sweet as it was at that moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She quietly left his room and went downstairs, planning to lounge on the couch for the next few hours before she’d take herself to bed. She had just poured herself a glass of wine and sat down when her phone buzzed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Soooo does Nicky have Spanish?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at the question. Of course she wouldn’t get away without Wanda commenting on it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: He does. What about it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: PLEASE I know she’s absolutely your type.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: She looks gay too. Idk how, I just got the vibe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: I will not humor you, dear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a long sip from her glass, shaking her head at her friend’s messages.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: I can be your wing woman! I bet I can get her number for you.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Don’t you dare. She’s Nicky’s teacher above all. I’m not risking embarrassment over being rejected AND still having to interact with her after the fact.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: ...Challenge accepted
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: I’m ending this conversation now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Love you too &lt;3
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned, tossing back the rest of her wine. She knew Wanda wouldn’t do anything she didn’t want her to if she asked, but part of her was interested to see if she could actually pull something off and at least learn more about Vidal.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without thinking the better of it, Agatha got an idea and pulled her phone out, googling the school staff page. She scrolled through the list until she found what she was looking for. Rio. Rio Vidal. At least she had a full name now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was tempted to type the name into Facebook or Instagram to see if she could find the woman’s profile, but she wasn’t drunk enough to make that stupid of a decision, thank goodness. She did however remember that she wanted to figure out the translation for what Rio had said to her earlier. She pulled up google translate and typed in the words she remembered hearing, a flush rising to her cheeks when she saw that querida translated to ‘dear.’ Maybe it was more common in hispanic culture to use the term of endearment, but she felt special that Vidal had used it on her earlier. God, she truly needed to get out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Side note and completely unrelated, are you free tonight?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: For you, always. What’s up?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: fwb? I need to be able to think clearly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Texting Vis to watch the boys as we speak.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Omw
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The text was followed by an eggplant emoji, causing Agatha to roll her eyes, but she was happy Wanda would be over to distract her. She and Wanda had been friends for ages, briefly dating in college before deciding there was no romantic spark there, but the sexual spark never left. Off and on they’d hook up to let off steam or just to be comforted, truly a friends with benefits situation that didn’t lead anywhere. She knew it was a unique experience and she was glad she had it, especially for moments like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not too much later, she received a text from Wanda letting her know she was there. She knew not to knock or ring the doorbell so as to not wake Nicky up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Definitely not about the hot Spanish teacher?” Wanda teased as she slipped in the house, taking Agatha’s hand to drag her to the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up,” she groaned, kissing her with the fierceness she needed for the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda only chuckled in response, wasting no time in undressing Agatha, knowing exactly what she needed in this situation after knowing her for so long.

     Wanda had left once Agatha fell asleep, the usual for their arrangement. Once Agatha woke up, her body was pleasantly sore. She stretched and sighed, feeling better after the weird turmoil she felt over Nicky’s teacher. She turned over and turned off her alarm, getting up and ready for the day. Agatha quickly got dressed, a white turtleneck paired with some brown slacks. She looked good, she knew it. Not that she was trying to impress anyone, it just felt good to know she looked hot.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked to Nicky’s room, gently nudging his shoulder to wake him up. “Time to get ready for school, baby,” she spoke softly, the boy blinking his eyes slowly before the words hit him. He shot up in bed, a wide grin in place.
    </p>
<p>
     “School day!” he shouted, his enthusiasm infectious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhmm, let’s get you ready, okay? How do you feel about your dinosaur shirt?” she asked, walking over to the dresser that held his clothes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rooaaarrrr!” he shouted, stalking around the room in his imitation of a T-Rex. Agatha took that as an affirmative and wrangled him into his clothes.
    </p>
<p>
     The morning flew by in a flurry of activity and soon enough she was pulling up to the school parking lot, that damn Coco album thankfully cutting off when she turned off the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, bud, let’s get you to Ms. Romanoff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky didn’t need to be told twice. He hopped out of the car and grabbed Agatha’s hand, practically dragging her towards the building. They reached the room easily enough and Nicky let go of her hand, walking to the cubby to put his backpack in, just as he was told to do at the open house. Her heart swelled and tears formed in her eyes. Her baby was growing up. He didn’t need her anymore, not for the day at least.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook her head and blinked the tears away before walking over to Nicky, bending down to kiss his forehead. “I’ll see you at the end of the day.” He reached up and hugged her tightly, his little arms wrapping around her neck. “Love you, Mamma.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too, my sweet boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to leave, walking out of the room feeling as if she left a piece of her heart behind. Agatha leaned against the wall outside of the classroom, taking a deep breath while closing her eyes, her head leaning back against the concrete while she tried to calm down.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” A voice spoke up, causing her to open her eyes and see the woman she tried her hardest to forget last night.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wiped her eyes and cleared her throat. “Yeah, yeah, I’m okay. First day just reminding me that I'm not getting any younger and Nicky is growing up no matter how hard I try to ignore it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face softened. She stepped closer and placed a comforting hand on Agatha’s arm. “Nicky seems like an amazing kid. He may grow up no matter what, but I think he’ll end up being a great person because of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled softly, looking down at the hand on her arm. “You don’t even know me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged and removed her hand. “I don’t need to know you to see how much you love your son.”
    </p>
<p>
     The honesty shook Agatha, making her heart warm. Wanda would have a field day if she were to witness this.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you. I should let you get back,” she replied, though a large part of her wanted to keep talking to the Spanish teacher.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm, yeah you’re right. Time to shape the minds of the future,” Rio replied, tapping her head with a finger. “Te veo, Ms. Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had no idea what that meant, making another mental note to look it up once she got in her car, but she smiled all the same. “Bye, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Work went by slowly, dragging on as Agatha waited for 2:30 PM to hit, indicating time for her to pick up Nicky. She could barely get work done, something she wasn’t known for at the office. In fact, her nickname was Hardass Harkness, something she was proud of given it showed she was dedicated to her work.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened up her email, attempting to force herself to focus. Her job as a PR Manager for a prestigious corporation, Stark Industries, came with the flexibility she needed with raising a young child on her own, but it was also demanding. This was proven by the multitude of emails she had received, asking her to put out metaphorical fires the idiot employees started. It allowed her to be firm and direct with others, ordering them around to fix their problems, thus earning her the nickname, but she enjoyed it, the sense of control she got in her position.
    </p>
<p>
     The current fire was some guy who leaked the newest product online before the company approved it. Lovely. It wasn’t something she could take back given it was already out there and surely saved by many others, but she could absolutely scare the shit out of him. She dialed the number on his file and smiled a devious smile. She loved this part.
    </p>
<p>
     The call thankfully made the time go by much quicker than before while also giving her a confidence boost, knowing the employee would certainly never make the same mistake again after the discussion she had with him. Soon enough, she was pulling into the parking lot of the school for the second time that day, eager to see how Nicky had done.
    </p>
<p>
     She made her way past kids running around in the hallway and quickly found her way to Romanoff’s classroom. What she saw when she entered made her heart swell. Nicky was sitting on the floor with a few other kids she didn’t know building legos together. The first day of school and he already appeared to have made new friends.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, look who’s here,” Ms. Romanoff said from across the room, causing Nicky to look up and run over to Agatha, almost knocking her off balance from the force of his little body crashing against her, his arms wrapping around her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ready to go home?” she asked, bending down to give him a proper hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhmm!” He agreed, breaking from the hug to run off and grab his backpack. “Bye Vanessa! Bye Miranda!” he shouted to the kids who had been playing with him.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and took Nicky’s hand, walking with him back to the car. Once she started driving home, Nicky began talking about his day and all the cool things he got to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “And we got to play outside and play tag and they gave us pizza for lunch! And Ms. Romanoff played a funny song about sharks. Oh! Mamma remember Ms. Vidal said she had a surprise? She turned on a video from Coco! And she asked if we knew some Spanish already and I told her I knew what familia was and she gave me a sticker!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at Nicky’s enthusiasm, her heart warm yet again as he recalled the details of the day and all the fun he appeared to have. She knew going to school was a big change, but it seemed like Nicky had adjusted well.
    </p>
<p>
     “A sticker? That’s so cool, Nicky. I bet Ms. Vidal was super proud of you,” she replied, her mind recalling the dark eyed woman and their moment from the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhmm she said I was so smart. And she told me Mamma means madre! You’re my madre,” he replied in a sing-song voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned and parked, helping Nicky from his car seat and into the house. “And I’m very very happy to be your madre,” she hummed, ruffling his hair.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the day went as well as it could with an energetic 6 year-old after his first day of school. He crashed around 8 PM in the living room, a toy still in his hand as if he fell asleep in the middle of playing. It wasn’t unlikely in all honesty. Agatha carried him to his room and tucked him in, taking him in as he slept peacefully, not a care in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Her night went by without any trouble, certainly not as eventful as the night before. She didn’t regret asking Wanda to come over last night, but she did regret the reason she had done so given it appeared to not have done much, her mind drifting off to her son’s Spanish teacher as frequently as it had before, especially after their moment this morning. Maybe sex wasn’t the answer then, at least not with someone who wasn’t said teacher.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned into her pillow at the thought. This was what led to her asking Wanda to come over in the first place, her mind left to its own devices once Nicky was in bed and she no longer had distractions. She truly didn’t utilize their agreement often, the last time happening, god, 6 months ago? She just thought it would work at the moment. Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
     What was it about Rio that made her so distracted? She had been attracted to many women before, but none had stuck with her like Rio did. Perhaps it was the way she interacted with Nicky. It made sense given he was the most important thing in her life and he seemed to adore the teacher. She also seemed to have layers that Agatha wanted to peel back after the unexpected moment of reassurance this morning.
    </p>
<p>
     A part of her wanted to see if there was something there between them, something Rio would like to explore with her, but there were too many complications. For one, she didn’t even know if Rio saw her that way or even liked women in general. The biggest factor though was Nicky. She wouldn’t be able to forgive herself if they did try to pursue something and it didn’t end well. He’d be caught in the middle of it no matter what and she didn’t want to risk that.
    </p>
<p>
     Why was she even thinking that far in advance? Wow, she really needed sleep. Thoughts of Vidal could wait until morning. If she was lucky, maybe she’d bump into her again when she dropped Nicky off tomorrow. A woman could dream.

<p>
<span>
      The week was going by pretty smoothly, Nicky still enjoying school as much as he had the first day. She hadn’t seen Vidal at all, but that probably was for the best given how she seemed to invade her mind. Better not add more interactions to dissect whenever she was alone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had dropped Nicky off earlier in the morning and was now sitting at her desk at work, thankfully able to focus more now that she knew Nicholas was loving school and adjusting well. Hardass Harkness was back in action. She had a meeting with the executive director, Tony, which she was currently on her way to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she walked in, she saw he noticed his signature sunglasses, causing her to roll her eyes because who wore sunglasses inside? She sat down and smoothed out her pants, waiting to begin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did well with the situation earlier this week,” Tony began, shutting the door to the conference room.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know,” Agatha replied in her usual confident tone. There may be portions of her life where she felt inadequate or needing guidance, but her job was certainly not one of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What we need to discuss is the problem with the flux capacitor still being out there. It’s not ready for mass production for another month. We barely have the prototype approved.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, I’m aware,” Agatha replied. Seriously, her job was to know this stuff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony shifted, putting his feet up on the table. “So what are we going to do about it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, knowing the “we” he talked about was actually going to be her. “It’s already out there, we can’t fix that. What we can do, and what I’ve been working on before being called to this meeting,” she paused to fix a glare at him, “is post a press release admitting to the mistake initially but following up with explaining why it is something to look forward to. They’ll focus more on the anticipation for what it can do rather than the fact it was leaked”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tony leaned back in his chair and pointed at her. “Harkness, you’re a genius.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, I know,”she responded as her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, expecting it to be yet another spam call, as they seemed to be the only calls she received before she froze in place, her heart stopping. Westview Elementary. “I need to take this,” she whispered, not waiting for a response as she left the room, quickly pressing the answer button.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicky? Is he okay? What’s wrong? Do I need to come over there and get him?” She asked in quick succession.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The voice at the other end took a moment before responding, long enough that Agatha had to check to make sure the call was still connected.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi, Ms. Harkness, it’s Ms. Vidal,” a concerned voice finally spoke.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Vidal? Why was she calling? Did something happen to Nicky in her class?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is he okay? What’s going on?” she asked, still confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I see now I probably should have sent an email instead,” Vidal chuckled softly into the receiver. “Yes, he is fine. That’s the reason I’m calling.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her brows in confusion, not understanding what she meant. “So you’re calling to tell me he’s okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, I intended to call you to let you know how well he was doing in class and how quickly he is grasping the content.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her heart slowed, mind catching up with the fact that Nicky was safe. Now that she understood what the call was about, she actually found it sweet Rio took the time to reach out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh god, I’m sorry. I saw the number was the school and assumed the worst,” she apologized, imagining how she must have sounded when she answered the call.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, no, don’t apologize. Like I said, it probably should have been an email now that I think about it. I would be the same way if I was in your position,” Rio explained, validating Agatha’s momentary freak out. “What I wanted to ask you was whether you’d be open to having him stay after school for a bit each day so I can tutor him. I’ve seen his excitement and I want to nurture that. Kids learn new languages surprisingly fast in comparison to adults so the earlier he starts to learn, the better. Of course, this is all if you would like him to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her mind immediately had two thoughts, neither very productive but they appeared nonetheless. First, it spoke well of Rio wanting to stay after school to help him. She knew teachers have a stressful job and probably wanted to go home as soon as they could, so she recognized the selfless act that only made her want to get closer to her. Secondly, and more selfishly, if she allowed Nicky to be tutored, it meant she’d pick him up each day from Vidal’s classroom meaning she would have five days in a row each week to see the woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think Nicky would hold it against me for the rest of my life if I said no,” she chuckled in reply. “He loves your class and I have the flexibility at work to leave whenever I need, so I don’t see a problem in it. Though maybe you can introduce him to Spanish music that isn’t that infernal Disney movie for the sake of my own sanity?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha heard a low chuckle in response which she knew she’d want to elicit from the woman more if she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll make note of that,” Rio replied, an amused smile forming on her lips on the other end of the phone, unbeknownst to Agatha. “Does next Monday work? I’d keep him for about an hour if that is alright?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s perfect. Nicky will be bouncing off the walls when I tell him,” Agatha replied, already imagining his reaction to the news.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Great,” Rio replied, her smile evident in her voice. “Monday it is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned, leaning back against the wall behind her. “Te veo, Vidal,” she replied, now knowing what it meant after a little google translate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A low chuckle emitted from the phone in response. “Te veo, querida,” Rio replied before hanging up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a moment to look at her phone, the call ended screen lingering before disappearing. Five days a week to see Rio Vidal. Oh, she was in trouble.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She put her phone away and went back into the conference room, apologizing for the abrupt departure.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the day went fairly smoothly, Agatha continuing to work on the press release, picking Nicky up from school and definitely not being slightly upset she didn’t see his Spanish teacher when doing so, and soon enough Nicky was asleep in bed, leaving Agatha to her own devices.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Against her better judgment, she decided to give Wanda a call and catch her up on the week’s events. The phone barely rang before Wanda answered with a “tell me everything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re ridiculous,” Agatha replied before complying. “I don’t know if there is much to tell. Rio called and asked to tutor Nicky after school starting next week. That’s it really but damn if I can’t stop trying to read into it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio, huh?” Wanda asked, amusement evident in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned, not even realizing she had slipped up. “I may have looked her up on the school website to see what her first name was.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mhmm, definitely keeping it cool, then,” Wanda teased. “Have you tried to look her up online?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She hated how Wanda knew that had been her immediate thought once she learned the woman’s name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I’m not that bad.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda was silent at the response, something that historically was not a great sign.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, if you’re looking her up now I’m ending the call.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Too late!” Wanda replied in a sing-song voice. “I found her instagram.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, I mean it,” Agatha replied, knowing her curiosity would get the best of her if Wanda spoke of it more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, but-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m hanging up,” Agatha groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ugh, you’re no fun,” Wanda replied, but gave up on pushing her. “Buuut she has your number now if she called you, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s eyes widened for a moment, the thought not having occurred to her. “Maybe? The call came from the school phone though.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay but if she got your number to call you on the school phone she definitely can add it to her own contacts,” Wanda replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re thinking too much into it. She just wants Nicky to learn more. It has nothing to do with me,” no matter how much Agatha may have wanted at least part of it to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mhmm okay but you’re going to have to see her every weekday now so you’re a part of it either way,” Wanda pressed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Honestly you should join track and field given how often you jump to conclusions,” Agatha replied, not taking the bait even though it had been a thought Agatha had previously as well. At least she acknowledged it wasn’t a realistic thought.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll take that as a complement to my athleticism,” the infuriating redhead responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It wasn’t meant to be,” she responded, shaking her head at Wanda’s intentional aloofness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m just saying there could be more there. At least test the waters and flirt a bit when you see her,” Wanda pressed, causing Agatha to roll her eyes, knowing Wanda would most likely already know she had been doing so even if she couldn’t see her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m actually hanging up now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Love youuu,” Wanda teased, a lighthearted chuckle following.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ended the call, not really feeling any better after the conversation. She wasn’t sure what she had expected though, given Wanda had already clocked Rio being her type and offering to be her wingwoman on the first day. Maybe a part of her wanted validation that her feelings weren’t entirely ridiculous. Wanda would certainly be the person to call for that, always supporting her wild behaviors even in situations she probably shouldn’t have.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sighed and tossed her phone to the side, knowing nothing productive would come from being on it longer. The fact remained she wouldn’t know anything until Monday and even then it would only be a brief period of time to pick Nicky up and leave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Despite the rationalization, she couldn’t help but to think this may be the first time she was looking forward to a Monday.

<span>
      Okay, perhaps Agatha had been a bit dramatic about dreading the weekend. In reality, it had been enjoyable. She took Nicky to the park where he spotted a few people he had met in school and quickly ran to join them. She also took him to Wanda’s to play with Billy and Tommy, allowing the two adults to chat in person. Wanda of course couldn’t help but to prod Agatha about Rio, but there wasn’t much more she could say, or at least was willing to say, given she hadn’t interacted with the woman since their call on Friday. She had also told Nicky about the arrangement for tutoring, which was the only thing he could talk about to everyone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soon enough, Monday rolled around and she was back to dropping Nicky off at school. She may have dressed up a bit more than usual knowing she’d see Rio today, but that was no one’s business but her own. She donned her favorite purple dress pants along with a pair of black heels, a white v-neck top that cut just close enough to count as business casual, and a black blazer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pressed a kiss to Nicky’s forehead once she led him to Ms. Romanoff’s room, the younger boy eagerly running off to play with his friends before class started. The drop off routine was slowly but surely becoming easier for her, even if her heart tugged every time she left the room without him following behind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Harkness, I was hoping to catch you this morning,” a voice called out behind her. Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned towards the woman, her hands in her pockets to put off a confident demeanor even if she was mainly doing it to hide her fidgeting. “Yes?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It completely slipped my mind that I need your written consent for tutoring to have on file,” Rio replied, hooking a thumb over her shoulder. “Do you have a second to come to my classroom and sign it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Go to her classroom, which would presumably be empty meaning Agatha would be alone with Rio. Her mind created many explicit images of Rio and her desk, but she forced them away as she nodded. “Sure, lead the way.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She followed behind Vidal, her eyes perhaps straying a bit to the way her pants clung to her form in a very flattering way, but she’d never admit that. They crossed into the room, Rio going to her desk to pull out the form needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I just need you to print and sign here and here,” she said, a delicate finger pointing to the blank spaces needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, taking a pen from Rio’s desk to sign before handing back the paper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio glanced over it and nodded, a slight smile on her face. “Agatha. Did you know that means ‘good’ in Greek?” she mused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know more than just Spanish and English?” Agatha asked, trying not to think about the way Rio had said her name. She absolutely was not thinking about how it would sound coming from the woman in various situations.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wouldn’t go that far. I did take an intro class in Greek in undergrad though,” she shrugged. “It’s a beautiful name.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt her face flush at the compliment annoying her more than anything. Why couldn’t she react like a normal person? She was 41 for goodness sake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t know that, but thank you. Now that you know mine, can I ask yours?” She of course wasn’t going to admit she already knew it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Rio,” she replied easily, leaning against her desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio. I like it,” Agatha responded without thinking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio simply smiled in response. “I’m glad you do, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fuck, the way she said her name once again caused a fluttering in her lower abdomen like a teenager.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha cleared her throat, not knowing how to respond to that directly, so she changed the subject instead. “I should go to work now,” she said lamely, knowing Tony didn’t care when she got to work as long as it got done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pushed herself off her position against the desk and nodded. “Sure. I didn’t mean to hold you up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, you’re fine, really,” Agatha replied, suddenly feeling bad about saying she needed to leave.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Promise?” Rio asked, holding her pinkie out to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman stared at it and smiled before linking her own finger around Rio’s. “Promise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded and unlinked their fingers. “Good. I’ll see you later, then,” she hummed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll be here,” Agatha replied, not wanting to leave but being in the room alone with Rio was taking her mind places it should not be while in an elementary school.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took a lot of effort for Agatha to leave the building, but she somehow managed to do so if only to prevent her from embarrassing herself by saying or doing something she’d regret. She still had no solid evidence of Rio’s preferences, but she absolutely overanalyzed every second of their interaction on her way to work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Speaking of, work was not the easiest to concentrate on. Her mind drifted off to theorizing what her interaction with Rio would be like when she went to pick Nicky up from his lesson. She would have Nicky there as a buffer to prevent her from doing anything too stupid but she wasn’t sure that would be enough. At her desk, she sighed and pulled her phone out, caving into one of the thoughts she had about getting Rio’s attention.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knew Rio had said “te veo” when leaving and Agatha had already surprised her by saying it herself, so she needed something new. She did a quick google search on common parting phrases in Spanish and took a screenshot. Hasta mañana-until tomorrow. That would be perfect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The idea of surprising Vidal with the phrase kept her going throughout the rest of the work day and soon enough she was walking into the Spanish teacher’s classroom for the second time that day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma!” Nicky cried out when he noticed she had walked in. He ran over to her to hug before grabbing her hand to drag her over to the desk he had been sitting at with Rio waiting for them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Vidal taught me some numbers! I’m seis! That means six,” he explained, very proud of himself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s amazing, honey,” she replied honestly. “And how about Momma?” she asked curiously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky scrunched up his face in thought. “I don’t know how to count that high yet.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ouch,” she responded, dramatically placing a hand on her chest. She could see Rio trying to hide a chuckle at the unintentional slight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If it helps, we only went up to 15 today,” she explained, standing up from her seat next to Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That certainly eases the pain,” Agatha replied, a mirthful smile on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do I get a sticker?” Nicky asked, hopping up from his seat to face Rio with a pleading look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled warmly at him and turned to go to her own desk. “You absolutely do.” She rummaged through her desk to find the sticker sheet, bringing it over to Nicky to pick one out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can Mamma have one too?” he asked innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyebrow raised with curiosity, glancing over at Agatha”. “I don’t know. Does she know some more Spanish?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Amazing. Agatha had already unintentionally prepared herself for this moment. “Hasta manana,” she said confidently, the latter word coming out as one would pronounce ‘banana.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The dark eyed teacher broke out into a fit of laughs, causing Agatha’s face to flush. Clearly she said something wrong. So much for being impressive.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry Nicky, it looks like your mom needs some more practice,” she teased gleefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky frowned and walked over to grab Agatha’s hand. “It’s okay, Mamma. I’ll help you practice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The words were spoken with so much sincerity that Agatha forgot to be embarrassed. All she felt now was pride for her son’s desire to help her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I would love that,” she said softly, ruffling his dark tresses. “My mini Spanish teacher.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky grinned proudly, seemingly loving the idea of being compared to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll give you all the stickers!” he exclaimed excitedly, bouncing up and down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Rio both laughed at his enthusiasm, exchanging glances as they did so. With Rio laughing so openly, Agatha got a glimpse at pointy incisors and immediately wondered how they would feel against her skin. Nope, not the thought to have around her son. Agatha broke eye contact with Rio and looked down at Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright love, we’ve kept Ms. Vidal long enough,” she said, half telling the truth and half needing an excuse to leave Rio’s vicinity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Adios Ms. Vidal!” he happily exclaimed, waving his hand at his teacher.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Adios, Nicholas,” Rio replied, a warm smile on her face at the excited boy. “Hasta mañana,” she smirked, eye connecting with Agatha’s once again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fuck, she really did mess up the pronunciation after hearing how it was actually supposed to be said. She’d have to remind herself to actually listen to the translations instead of just reading them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The drive home was consumed by Nicky practicing what he had learned, counting from 1 to 15 over and over again until they reached their home. She couldn’t find it in herself to be annoyed by the repetitiveness either, knowing he was doing it because it was important to him and made him happy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the evening was nice, their new after school routine becoming more familiar to Nicky after being in school for a week. They had dinner together- dino nuggets for Nicky, a salad for Agatha- and she helped him wash up before tucking him into bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had just settled into her own bed, prepared to aimlessly scroll on her phone for a bit when her phone rang, Wanda’s name popping up on the screen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So I did a thing,” Wanda said before Agatha even had time to say hello.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That could mean literally anything when it comes to you,” Agatha replied. “Elaborate.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well I created a fake Instagram account to follow Vidal-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did what?” Agatha asked, cutting Wanda off. “I explicitly told you not to do that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I take my job as wingwoman seriously, Agatha Harkness,” Wanda replied, unfazed by Agatha’s frustration. “You’ll want to know what I found out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a deep breath. She knew she could say no and just go on with her life, but curiosity killed the cat, so they say. “Fine. Tell me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s knowing chuckle emitted through the phone. “So she’s definitely into women. She has a post at a pride parade wearing a pin that says ‘I’m here, I’m queer, let’s grab a beer.’”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Interesting. Agatha certainly felt more confident about potentially flirting with Rio now that she knew it may be reciprocated, but it also scared the hell out of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What else?” she couldn’t help but to ask.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm, she has a birthday post from this year. She just turned 35,” Wanda replied, happily doling out the information to her friend now that she finally had permission.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s so young,” Agatha frowned, worry rising up again at the metaphorical idea of her attempting anything with the woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s literally 6 years younger than you,” Wanda replied with a scoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Being a 41 year-old single mother and being a presumably (hopefully) single 35 year-old are two very different things,” Agatha responded with exasperation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mhmm, you keep telling yourself that. Maybe her type is older milfs,” Wanda teased. “You never know until you ask.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda Maximoff, I will pretend you didn’t just say that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pretend all you want, I know you’ll still think about it,” her infuriating friend replied, absolutely correctly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned, hating how Wanda knew her so well sometimes. “Thinking about it doesn’t mean acting on it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can put in a good word for you to give you a push,” Wanda suggested in a cheeky tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You will absolutely not be doing that. I forbid it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oooo I’m scared,” Wanda chuckled. “Fine, I won’t, but you need to do something because 90 percent of our conversations include you lamenting on whether or not something could happen between you two without you doing anything about it. A girl can only listen to so much pity party talk.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I-,” she stumbled, “that is not what I do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh dear Agatha, you poor hopeless soul. Just… do something, anything, the next time you see her. Taking action and learning it’s not going to go anywhere is better than thinking about what-ifs all the time. At least you’ll know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, knowing Wanda was right but she hated to admit it. “I’ll try. I don’t know what exactly I’ll do but I can try.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I happen to know her favorite color is green and you happen to have a green dress. What a coincidence,” Wanda’s cheeky tone reemerged.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s…something. I guess I can start with that.” It didn’t involve her attempting to flirt and potentially embarrassing herself, so it could work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s the spirit! Go get ‘em, tiger!” Wanda cheered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re the worst,” Agatha replied fondly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know, but you love me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Unfortunately I do,” she responded, having no idea where she would be without Wanda at this point, even if she was annoyingly pushy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get your beauty sleep. You’ve got a woman to woo tomorrow,” Wanda teased, causing Agatha to roll her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don't know about that, but I do need sleep. Goodnight, stalker.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodnight, my amazingly talented and beautiful milf best friend!” Wanda teased before ending the call.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Green dress tomorrow, that would be easy enough. It wouldn’t require attempts to flirt and potentially put the ball in Rio’s court to compliment her. She could work with that.
     </span>

<div>
<p>
     The next morning, Agatha woke up with a little spark of hope. Despite how annoying Wanda could be with her instigating, she did provide some good information. At least she knew there was potentially a chance.
    </p>
<p>
     She got up and put on the green dress Wanda had mentioned. It was mostly suitable for work, a slit forming on the side to show off some thigh, especially if she sat down, but she could get away with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting Nicky dressed and ready for school was surprisingly uneventful and soon enough she was at work. She tried not to think about the fact that she didn’t see Rio when she dropped Nicky off and had to reassure herself with the knowledge that she would see her at the end of the day. That was important given she needed to focus on finishing the press release she had been working on.
    </p>
<p>
     Tony had been a pain in the ass about getting it out and she could only take so much more before she said something to him that may get her fired. The man sure asked for a lot without offering assistance. She wouldn’t let him help if he asked, but the gesture would at least be appreciated.
    </p>
<p>
     She worked on the press release, reading over it for errors before deciding it would be good enough to send out. One fire out, surely many more to come.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting the release finished and sent out took up the majority of her time and before she knew it, she was back at the school. Her heart was hammering against her chest from the simple knowledge that Rio being interested in her was at least a possibility. She took a deep breath and entered the classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, Mamma,” Nicky said happily, kicking his feet back and forth at his desk. “Come look at what I did!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked over to him, trying not to look at Rio but she couldn’t help but to risk a glance. The teacher was dressed in all black, long sleeves rolled up to her elbow. Her hair was pulled up in a clip and Agatha wanted nothing more than to take it out and run her fingers through it, maybe tug a bit at the nape of her neck…
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down next to Nicky, clearing her throat as she glanced at his desk, trying to wipe the dirty thoughts from her mind. She wasn’t going to do anything risky in front of her 6 year-old son after all.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky got her attention again, pointing to various animals he had colored on the paper in front of him, the spanish translation written below. “This is a gato,” he explained, pointing to a picture of a cat. “And this is a perro,” pointing to a dog this time.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Perro,
     </em>
     ” Rio corrected, rolling her ‘r’ in a way that shouldn’t have sounded as sexy as it did.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky scrunched his face and tried multiple times to replicate the sound, each attempt coming out as more of gust of breath than anything resembling what Rio had tried. He frowned after his fifth failed attempt. “I can’t do it,” he lamented.
    </p>
<p>
     “It takes some practice,” Rio encouraged in a gentle tone. “Your tongue isn’t used to moving that way because English doesn’t need it.”
    </p>
<p>
     The innocent comment immediately flooded Agatha’s mind with images of what else Rio’s tongue could do. STOP, she thought. For goodness sake, Nicky was sitting right there.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you do it, Mamma?” Nicky asked, looking up at her. Well, who could deny that cute little face?
    </p>
<p>
     “I can,” she replied, replicating the sound. She wouldn’t admit she only knew how to do so after listening to Shakira so much in college.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes darkened slightly at the display from Agatha, or perhaps it was a trick of the light. It probably was that. “Impressive, Agatha,” she responded, her voice slightly huskier than before. They way she said Agatha’s name did things to her that were wildly inappropriate in their given situation.
    </p>
<p>
     She cleared her throat, her gaze turning back to Nicky. “I’ll help you practice when we get home, alright pet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky nodded enthusiastically, seemingly content with the agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ms. Harkness, can I speak with you outside?” Rio asked, causing Agatha to glance up at her, heart pounding. What could she possibly need to speak with her privately about?
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, sure. Nicky, we’ll be right back.”
    </p>
<p>
     He hummed and picked up a crayon, going back to coloring in the animals, unfazed by Agatha’s inner turmoil.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed Rio just outside her room to where Nicky couldn’t hear them, her mind reeling with what could be discussed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is everything alright with Nicky?” she asked once they were out of earshot, confusion written on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached out and placed a hand on Agatha’s arm, reminding her of the first day she dropped Nicky off and Rio comforted her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, he’s perfect. I just wanted to check in to see how you were doing after last week and I figured you wouldn’t want Nicky to hear,” Rio said sincerely. Agatha’s heart warmed at the concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m…okay. It gets a little easier every day, but it’s still hard to not have him with me all the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s thumb rubbed a soothing pattern against Agatha’s arm that was doing more to distract her than it should.
    </p>
<p>
     “He really loves you, you know? He talks about you all the time when I meet with him,” Rio responded.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt tears well in her eyes. She knew adopting and raising Nicky on her own could risk him resenting her for not having a second parent or not knowing who his parents were, so hearing it was the opposite of that gave her validation she didn’t know she needed so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, it’s okay, cariño” Rio said, her hand coming up to cup Agatha’s face, her thumb wiping away a stray tear.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched at the intimate touch, her icy blue eyes meeting Rio’s contrasting dark eyes. “Thank you,” she muttered softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “De nada,” the teacher replied, removing her hand from Agatha’s face. “Maybe take a moment before going back in so Nicky doesn’t ask why I made you cry?” she said with a soft chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled in reply, wiping her tears on her arm. “I didn’t intend to be a mess when I walked in here,” she joked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are anything but a mess, Harkness. Look at you,” Rio gestured to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Crying and tired?” Agatha responded in a self-deprecating way she usually didn’t show around others.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, hermosa y alguien a quien quiero conocer mejor,” Rio replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what that means,” the older woman chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio smirked. “Consider it homework.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So now I’m getting homework? Isn’t Nicky supposed to be the one getting that?” She asked, a smile forming despite herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm, that’s for tutoring. This is for my amusement,” the teacher replied, her smirk only growing before she turned and returned to the classroom, leaving Agatha confused and turned on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, time to pack up. Your mom has some work to do when she gets home,” Rio’s voice rang out.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a deep breath and returned to the room, both wanting to get out of there as soon as she could and hoping to hear more from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mamma, why is your face red?” Nicky asked innocently, shrugging his backpack on.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s face flushed even more, Rio stifling a laugh at the question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, hot flash. I’ll tell you about it when you get older. Come on, love,” Agatha replied, shuffling Nicky along with her, trying to escape the amused grin from his teacher.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye Ms. Vidal!” Nicky turned and called out despite the shuffling from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “See you tomorrow. Remember your homework,” Rio responded, her gaze fully on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman turned and finally led Nicholas out of the room and into the car. She may have doubted Rio’s interest in her, but that had definitely been flirting. Fuck.

      The first thing Agatha did when she walked in her house that night was pull out her phone and google what in the world Rio had said to her. Nicky had placed his backpack down and was walking around aimlessly, still trying to get his ‘r’ to roll. With him occupied, she pressed ‘translate’ and waited.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Beautiful and someone I would like to know better.” That’s what Rio had said to her outside her classroom. Her stomach did a flip as it really hit her that Rio seemed to feel the same curiosity about her as she had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma, help please,” Nicky’s voice broke through her spiraling thoughts. She locked her phone and put it away, giving Nicky all her attention. She would address the revelation from the other woman later when Nicky was in bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sat down with him and worked with him on the pronunciation, giving tips on what part of his mouth to place his tongue when he breathed out. He seemed to be getting close to getting it down by the time they finished dinner and put him to bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once she was safely alone in bed, she pulled out her phone again and chewed on the bottom of her lip. She was feeling risky, getting an idea that may not work out well. Wanda’s words from the night before rang in her mind-taking action and learning it’s not going to go anywhere is better than thinking about what-ifs all the time. If it ended poorly, she’d put the blame on Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With her decision made, she opened her Instagram app and typed in Rio’s name. A private profile appeared in the search results, but the profile photo was unmistakably Nicky’s teacher. She took a breath and pressed ‘request to follow.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha tossed her phone on the other side of the bed after she had pressed it, unsure of what the results would be of the action but there was no taking it back now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sat and stared at the phone like it would jump up and bite her, afraid to look at it to see if anything had happened. This was ridiculous. She took a breath and leaned over to grab it just as 2 notifications popped up. ‘Follow request accepted’ and ‘ItsRioBitch followed you.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She immediately opened the app and scrolled through Rio’s photos now that she could see them. She noted the photos Wanda had told her about along with a Halloween costume that looks like something out of the 70’s. The outfit was more than flattering on her, her chest exposed with the rest of the garment on either side, preventing it from being too explicit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha quickly went to her own page, initially not even thinking about the fact that Rio would see her posts as well. She didn’t post much, thankfully, and most were photos of Nicky but she did have a few that made her face flush at the thought of Rio viewing, such as a photo of her and Wanda at the beach a few years ago. They had their arms around each other wearing bathing suits, lots of skin exposed. She wondered what Rio would think about if/when she saw it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was continuing to look at her photos when another notification appeared. ‘ItsRioBitch’ sent a message. Her heartbeat increased as she pressed the button to view the message, wondering what the dark eyed woman had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Fancy seeing you here, Harkness
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was all it said, but it seemed pretty positive, so she responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Well, I did my homework
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Not much longer after she pressed send, three dots appeared indicating Rio was typing. The anticipation was killing her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Thoughts?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I might want to know you better too
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: That’s what I like to hear
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could imagine the words coming from Rio and groaned at the thought. Clearly this woman would be the death of her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I don’t want to tell Nicky about it at first though, that’s a dealbreaker
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Tell Nicky what? I’m just trying to get to know a pretty lady better
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I won’t say anything to him unless you want me to.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was funny how quickly Rio had switched from flirting to being serious, almost as if she could sense Agatha needed the assurance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: What is it you want to know?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Oh, there’s so many things. First, why did you wear that dress today?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That certainly wasn’t the question Agatha was expecting Rio to ask. She couldn’t outright admit she wore it to see Rio’s reaction, at least not yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: No reason really, I just figured it would be nice for work.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Is that all?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: What are you insinuating?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Nothing, just wondering. If there were other motives, I’d be inclined to give you a gold star
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed out loud at the comment. Whatever she had been expecting as a reply, it wasn’t that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: A shame. I did my homework though, surely that earns a sticker
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: You make a good point. I’ll give you your reward tomorrow
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh, the thought of certain rewards she’d like to receive from Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Promise?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: You earned it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Now can I ask a question?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Ask away
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Does my being 41 change anything?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Absolutely not. Honestly, it makes me even more interested in you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blushed, grateful Rio couldn’t see her face at that moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark:You flatter me, Vidal
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: It seems that’s easy to do
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Not usually
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Mmm so it’s just with me?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Is that your next question?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: No, I already know the answer to that, I just wanted to see if you admitted it
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Have you ever been with a woman?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I see you’re getting straight to the point.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: But yes, exclusively
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Can’t blame a woman for being curious. How long has it been since your last time?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her mind flashed back to just a week ago when she had asked Wanda to come over. She certainly didn’t want to get into that with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I believe it’s my turn for a question
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Fair enough
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: How do you take your coffee?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Black, like my heart
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I’m pretty sure this conversation is proof enough you don’t have a black heart
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: You sure? What if I’m trying to flatter you enough to get what I want and then act like it never happened?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Are you?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I can’t say it wasn’t my immediate thought when I first met you, but no. I meant it when I said I want to get to know you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s mind immediately flashed back to the open house, Rio greeting them warmly in her green jumpsuit. If only she had known what Rio was thinking about her then.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: In Spanish, knowing I wouldn’t know what you were saying
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Delayed gratification
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Do you feel gratified?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Very. I wouldn’t be having this conversation with you if I hadn’t done it now would I? And now I get to see all your posts. Consider myself gratified.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: There isn’t much to see
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Quite the contrary, I see quite a lot. Nice bathing suit by the way
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      So she did see that post. Agatha bit her lip at the thought of Rio looking at it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Thanks. Nice Halloween costume
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: You like?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I do
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Good
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: As much as I want to continue this conversation, if I don’t go to sleep now I’m going to be a bitch in the morning. I look forward to giving you that prize you earned tomorrow
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: You’ve certainly piqued my curiosity. Sleep well, Vidal
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: You too, querida
     </span>

      The next morning was anxiety inducing to say the least. Agatha woke up and immediately recalled the conversation from the night before. It felt like a dream if she were to be honest but after double checking her phone she could confirm it was definitely real.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha decided she would dress in a white top, rolling the sleeves up, and purple pants. It was kind of her signature look, which would benefit her today as it helped her feel more comfortable and confident.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She helped Nicky get up and ready, leaving enough time to enact her plan for the morning. Soon they were back to the building and Nicky was running off to play with his friends. She smiled at his excitement and turned from the door to the classroom, taking a breath to steady herself before making her way to Rio’s classroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once she arrived she knocked on the door, Rio looking up from her desk where she had been focusing on grading. When their eyes connected, Rio produced what seemed to be her signature smirk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well hello there,” she said, standing up from her desk to greet Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I brought you something,” Agatha replied, holding out the thermos she brought into the school with her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took the drink and opened it, smelling the aroma of fresh coffee. “You brought a gift for little ole me?” she asked, placing a dramatic hand to her chest.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled and shrugged. “I made myself some too. I figured I might as well since I was already making my own.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm how thoughtful,” Rio hummed, taking a sip of the beverage. “Just the way I like it too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s pretty hard to mess up black coffee,” Agatha chuckled in response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’d be surprised,” Rio responded, placing the thermos on her desk. “I’ll give that back when I see you later.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That works,” Agatha smiled softly. It was interesting how she both felt on edge but comfortable while talking to Rio. Perhaps it was the tension between them that couldn’t actually be crossed while in the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And I also have your reward for later,” Rio smirked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Any hint?” Agatha asked curiously, wondering what exactly Rio had planned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The younger woman raised an eyebrow before walking into Agatha’s space. “Good girls learn to be patient,” she said in a husky voice that did things to Agatha’s body. She involuntarily let out a soft moan, almost imperceptible but given their proximity Rio absolutely heard it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teacher’s eyes darkened, the smirk never leaving her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can be good,” Agatha whispered, looking anywhere but Rio’s captivating eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Clearly that wasn’t acceptable for Rio, as she gripped Agatha's chin, forcing her to look at her. “Tienes suerte de que pronto tendré una clase porque estoy tentada a ver lo buena que puedes ser para mí.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Clearly whatever Rio said was not appropriate for the setting they were in, she could tell that much from the intensity at which she was staring at her. There was no way she’d remember all the words she said in order to look it up though.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio released Agatha’s chin and walked back to her desk as if she hadn’t set Agatha’s body alight. “Thanks for the coffee. You may go,” she declared, her eyes going back to the papers she had been grading.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood frozen for a moment, still recovering from whatever Rio had said earlier and the proximity to her. Now with the calm dismissal as if nothing had even happened, she was both confused but terribly aroused. Oh, Rio knew exactly what she was doing and she was doing it well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha blinked and turned to leave, pausing at the doorway to peek back at Rio to see if she was watching her, but the woman still had her eyes focused on the papers in front of her. She shook her head and left, using the entire drive to work attempting to dissect what had just happened. The past 24 hours felt like a whirlwind and it threw her off. She enjoyed it, the attention she was getting and the validation of her own attraction, but fuck, she had no idea Rio would be like this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she was increasingly finding after leaving the school, it was hard for her to focus on work once again. The damn woman got in her head and wouldn’t leave. She groaned and pulled out her phone, tapping on the instagram app knowing she wasn’t in the right headspace to get work done.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She scrolled through Rio’s profile, taking in the photos she posted. She felt like a lovesick teenager, but she was genuinely curious about Rio and wanted to learn more about her. That and she couldn’t stop thinking about her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      There was a post from a few months ago showing her holding a bunny and looking absolutely adorable. It was crazy how the woman would both look so sweet yet do whatever she did to Agatha earlier that morning. The caption under the post revealed the animal was her pet named Señor Scratchy. Was that not the cutest name ever?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the work day went about the same as how it began- Agatha attempting to do work but finding her mind drifting off to the next time she’d see Rio. It was kind of pathetic how much she had gotten into her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Thankfully the time rolled around for her to leave and she soon found herself making the familiar walk to Rio’s classroom. As she walked in, she noticed Nicky hadn’t seen her yet, but Rio had. She smiled at Agatha and nudged Nicky. “Su madre está aquí.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky looked up, a bright smile on his face. “Hi Mamma!” he grinned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart warmed as it always did when she saw his excitement at her arrival. She made her way over to him, standing behind his chair to peer down at his work. “What did you learn today, love?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As he prattled on about what he had been taught, she was able to glance over at Rio without Nicky noticing only to find the woman already staring back at her. Rio held her gaze until Agatha looked away, forcing her attention back to her son.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s great, baby,” she told him, only vaguely aware of what he had been saying.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sticker?” he asked, looking at Rio expectantly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio only chuckled and nodded, going to her desk to grab the sheet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re going to run out of places to put them,” Agatha said with a lighthearted smile, following Nicky to Rio’s desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nuh-uh,” he replied, happily picking out a sticker from the sheet Rio had given him. “Can Mamma have a sticker today?” he asked, looking up at Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked over Nicky to Agatha, her smirk returning once more. “I have something different for your madre,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The teacher pulled out the thermos Agatha had given her earlier that morning and handed it to her. That was it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I cleaned it in the teacher’s lounge,” was all Rio said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You got a cup! That’s so cool!” Nicky exclaimed, oblivious to the fact that it was theirs to begin with. What was Rio’s angle?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm, yes, very kind of her,” Agatha responded, looking at Rio with a confused expression. Rio’s own expression never shifted, the amused smirk painted on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “See you tomorrow, Nicky,” Rio replied, apparently dismissing them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bye Ms. Vidal!” he called back, grabbing Agatha’s hand to lead her out of the building.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      On the drive home, Agatha couldn’t help but to feel disappointed. Was Rio just teasing her and lying? It didn’t seem like something she’d do but she couldn’t understand where he had been going with giving her back the thermos.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She helped Nicky get ready for bed before going to the kitchen to put the thermos away. As she lifted it to its spot in the cabinet, she felt something shift inside. Curiosity got the best of her and she opened the thermos to find a silver necklace with a charm that had a pressed flower. She didn’t know much about flora but she didn’t need to know that to know it was beautiful.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A smile formed on her lips as she pulled her phone out to message Rio, surprised to see a message already waiting for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Did you find it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I did. It’s beautiful, Rio. You didn’t need to do that
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: A beautiful piece for a beautiful woman. It’s nothing. Plus, maybe I’d like to see you wear it and know it’s from me
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart warmed at the unexpected complement. Rio was certainly an enigma she was increasingly curious to learn more about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Do you know the meaning of it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Well I’m assuming it’s my reward for yesterday, no?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: The necklace, yes. I meant the flower
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Ah, well I don’t know much about flowers so I’m afraid not
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Red orchid. Look it up
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, leaving the app to google the meaning behind the flower. Oh. “Fire, passion, desire, and romance.” Rio was something else.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I didn’t know you were such a romantic
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: There’s a lot you don’t know about me yet
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Yet?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Yes. I intend for us to know each other intimately
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt heat burning in her at the comment when she got another message.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Let me take you on a date. Friday night, 8 PM. I’ll pick you up
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      One on one time outside the school with Rio? Fuck, how could she say no?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I’ll have to find someone to watch Nicky
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Make it happen
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark:You’re really pushy, you know?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Oh you don't even know the half of it
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha immediately exited the app and dialed Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I need you to watch Nicky Friday night.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well hello to you too. How are you doing? I’m just fine, thanks for asking,” Wanda teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio asked me on a date, no time for joking,” Agatha responded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh shit! I feel like I’m missing some plot development here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed and filled Wanda in on everything she had neglected to tell her about the past few days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well damn, I’m feeling hot and bothered and it’s not even happening to me,” Wanda said once Agatha caught her up on everything. “I’ll make it a sleepover in case you need the house empty for…nightly activities.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, though her mind produced images of various things that could happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not on the first date, Wands.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You must really like her,” Wanda’s voice came through much softer than before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, I think I do. Or at least I want to see if there’s something there beyond sexual attraction.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m really happy for you, Agatha,” Wanda responded honestly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, I think this is going to be a good thing. I just have a good feeling about it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look at you, so smitten and you haven’t even gone on the date yet,” the redhead teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up,” Agatha chuckled. “Thank you though. I’ll text you about getting Nicky and dropping him off.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure, of course. Anything to get you laid!” Wanda couldn’t help but to tease.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Goodnight, Wanda,” Agatha replied, shaking her head at Wanda’s enthusiasm.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Night, lover girl.”

      The rest of the week flew by, Agatha’s excitement and curiosity driving her to Friday. Rio made a few flirty comments here and there, but she gave no hint as to what they would be doing when she took her out, only briefly mentioning she should dress comfortably for the weather.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      This led to Agatha staring at the contents of her closet for far too long, imagining what would both be comfortable but also flattering. It wasn’t as if she needed to make a first impression, but she still wanted to look nice given it was the first time they would be spending time together outside of school.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She decided to settle on jeans, comfortable enough to wear outside but also tight enough to show off her figure, and a black and white striped top. Cute, but casual. It would have to work because the longer she looked at herself in the mirror, the more she would reconsider the outfit and be back where she started.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda had picked up Nicky an hour ago and the house felt empty without him. Thinking about it, she wasn’t sure the last time she had been in the house without Nicky present. She removed herself from her mother and had no other family, so besides Wanda there really was no one else to watch him and she often didn’t want to burden Wanda with another kid since she already had the twins. That being said, Wanda often offered to have him over so it was more of an internal debate than outside pressure to keep him home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her thoughts were broken by a knock on her door. Her heart leaped, again reminding her of being on a first date as a teen, and she walked to open the door for Rio. Once she was faced with the woman, she was shocked to see her holding a bouquet of flowers, the same kind as the one in the necklace Rio had given her (one she had worn every day since receiving it).
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “M’lady,” Rio said, holding the bouquet out to Agatha. With the bouquet now in her hands, she was able to fully take Rio in. The younger woman was wearing tight black jeans with rips in them and a black leather jacket over a tank top. She paired this with dark eyeshadow and lipstick that would make anyone else look ridiculous but it worked for Rio and god if she didn’t look enticing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You didn’t need to get me anything,” Agatha replied after a few moments. “I’ll go get a vase and put them in so they don’t go bad. Feel free to come in,” she said, turning to go inside in search of a vase. Did she even own one? She couldn’t remember the last time she had ever bought fresh flowers and had need of one, but she vaguely recalled having one shoved in the back of a cabinet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nice place,” she heard Rio call from somewhere behind her as her head was ducked inside the bottom cabinet in her kitchen, trying to find the vase.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t mind the mess. I didn’t realize you’d be coming inside,” Agatha called back before finally spotting what she had been looking for.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She crawled back out from the cabinet to find Rio closer than she had thought she was, the signature smirk back on her face. “I don’t know about a mess, but I did just have a perfect view,” she replied, her eyes glued to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s face flushed and she immediately turned around to face the sink, using it as an excuse to fill the vase with water when really she didn’t want Rio to see how much the comment affected her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here, let me,” Rio said, the front of her body briefly pressing against Agatha’s to scoot past her and grab the bouquet. Agatha’s breath hitched at the contact and she had to focus her gaze on the running water to remind herself to breathe. Fuck, they hadn’t even left her house and she was already a mess from Rio’s actions. How was she supposed to survive the next few hours?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned the water off and handed the vase to Rio, watching as she took the plastic from the outside off and arranged the flowers how she liked. “There, perfect,” Rio declared.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you,” Agatha muttered, wondering what else Rio had in store. She had to give it to her, she had already started off on a great foot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ready?” Rio asked, eyebrow raised.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded and followed Rio out of the house and into the passenger seat of the car which Rio held open for her. She really was pulling out all the stops, it seemed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So where are we going?” Agatha probed, knowing Rio well enough at this point that it would be unlikely she would get an answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Remember what I said about patience?” Rio asked, turning on the car and pulling away from Agatha’s house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her face flushed as she thought back to exactly what Rio was referring to. She could practically feel the way Rio had gripped her face and asked her to be good.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She remained silent now that she knew she wouldn’t be getting a response from Rio and glanced out of the window, trying to gauge where she could be taking her, but it was no use. After a few minutes of driving, Rio had taken a turn that led somewhere Agatha had never been. So much for trying to guess.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It wasn’t much longer before they pulled to the side of what appeared to just be a large open grassy area.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not planning to murder me, are you?” Agatha teased, wondering what they could be doing in such a secluded area, or at least what appeared to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ll see how the night goes,” Rio teased back, stepping out of the car to open the door for Agatha once again before going to the trunk and pulling out a basket. “Come,” she commanded, gesturing for Agatha to follow.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wanted to say something snarky in response but curiosity won over the potential reprimand she would receive and she followed close behind Rio. They walked over a slight hill to reveal a large slope of grass, people scattered across on blankets and chairs they had brought all facing what appeared to be an amphitheater. This was here the whole time and Agatha didn’t know about it?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio set the basket on the ground and pulled a flannel blanket from it before spreading it on the ground. She sat down and patted the spot next to her, indicating for Agatha to sit. Agatha followed suit and glanced at the stage, wondering what was supposed to be playing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I may have had some help from Nicky to figure out if this would be something you’d be interested in,” Rio admitted with a cheeky grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, using my son against me?” Agatha responded, though lightheartedly. She found it sweet Rio was trying to find something she would enjoy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It would say quite the opposite,” Rio replied easily, opening the basket back up to grab what appeared to be two glasses and a bottle of wine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A woman after my own heart,” Agatha declared, placing a hand on her chest at the sight of the bottle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s the goal,” Rio responded, opening the bottle with a corkscrew she had produced from the basket as well. She poured them each a glass and held hers up to Agatha’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “To the first date of many,” she said confidently as a toast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clinked her glass with Rio’s before taking a sip. It was a sweet red, her favorite type.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re very cocky for someone who hasn’t even finished the first date,” Agatha explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned over to Agatha and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “I have a habit of getting what I want.” Her face was so close to Agatha that she could feel her hot breath ghosting her ear. She couldn’t suppress the shiver that came as a response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio returned back to her original position, drinking her own glass as if she hadn’t just caused Agatha to momentarily forget to breathe. Before she could even come up with a response, an orchestra appeared to set up on the stage and begin playing. The music sounded familiar and it took a while to place it but when she did, her heart warmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lorna Wu’s Ballad,” she muttered, looking at Rio with awe. She supposed she did sing it often to Nicky when he was having trouble sleeping, but she had no idea he had told Rio about that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, seemingly happy Agatha was pleased. “They’re covering some of her popular discography.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was amazed at the thought Rio had put into this and honestly could have kissed her on the spot if she wasn’t trying to take this slow. “What else has my son said to you?” she asked, eyebrow raising in curiosity.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled and shook her head. “That’s for me to know and you to maybe find out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They sat without talking for a bit, listening to the orchestra play. Agatha couldn’t help but to be impressed with Rio’s choice. She couldn’t remember a time when someone had treated her like this which only made her hope it continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You look cold,” Rio’s voice broke through the music. She shrugged off her jacket as Agatha looked down at her arms, not even realizing she had goosebumps. Before she could say anything, Rio wrapped the jacket around Agatha’s shoulders. She was immediately hit with a woody yet spicy smell, something uniquely Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Won’t you be cold in just that?” Agatha asked, glancing over at Rio whose arms were now exposed. It was then that Agatha realized she had only ever seen the woman wearing long sleeves given she never knew Rio had a tattoo on her upper arm of an intricate skull, flowers coming out of holes where the eyes would be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sure we can find a way for you to help warm me up later,” Rio shrugged, pushing her legs out in front of her to lean back on her hands in a way that highlighted her muscles. Fuck, Agatha was screwed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t sleep with people on first dates,” Agatha said, knowing she’d need to set that boundary even if her mind was telling her to forget it. She needed to take it slower than she wanted, not wanting to get too far into it and hurt Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who said anything about that?” Rio asked, an eyebrow quirked innocently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt her body warm and not because of the jacket Rio had given her or the alcohol. A series of images flashed through her mind at the possibilities.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the evening went fairly the same, Agatha bringing up a topic and Rio finding a way to reply in a flirtatious manner. Agatha found herself trying to bring more things up just to hear Rio’s voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you do when you’re not at work?” she asked, genuinely curious.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees. “Nothing too interesting during the weekdays. I play softball on the weekends though. You should bring Nicky to a game sometime,” she suggested.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Softball, huh. She hadn’t imagined Rio playing any sports but now that she thought about it, it seemed to fit her. She’d be interested to see Rio play, not just because she knew the uniforms typically held little to the imagination when it came to the pants, though that was certainly a consideration.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That would explain the muscles,” Agatha found herself saying without thinking, causing Rio to smirk at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You noticed, hm?” she asked, her silky voice lowering its tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s hard not to when you’re wearing that,” Agatha replied, swallowing thickly at the things Rio’s voice was doing to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. I plan to put them to good use with you one day, Agatha,” she responded, dragging the syllables in her name out in a way that shouldn’t have sounded as seductive as it did.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha instinctively reached up to fidget with the chain of the necklace she was wearing, trying to calm her mind from spiraling with the thoughts she was having from the insinuation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio glanced at Agatha curiously, noticing the necklace for the first time. She smirked and crawled over to sit in front of Agatha, reaching out to look at the necklace. “I like the way this looks on you,” she said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked up at her, the soft hand gently holding the necklace to examine it. “I told you it was beautiful. I meant it,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just that?” Rio asked, giving Agatha a curious expression.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, what else?” the older woman replied, knowing what Rio was asking about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm nothing. It just would be nice to know that you wear it to show you’re mine,” Rio replied in a casual tone, moving back to her previous position next to Agatha after dropping the necklace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached out and grabbed Rio’s arm before thinking about it, stopping her in her place. “Maybe I do,” she said after a moment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked over at Agatha, a glint of amusement in her eyes. “Is that so?” she asked. “Choose your next words wisely, Agatha.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman held Rio’s gaze and nodded. “I wear it for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s face broke into an amused smirk. She moved back to sitting in front of Agatha and gently grabbed the chain of the necklace again, tugging lightly to pull Agatha closer until their faces were close enough to feel each other’s breath. “Good girl.”

      “Good girl.” The two words played over and over in Agatha’s mind on the drive back to her house. She shouldn’t have been affected by it as much as she was given she was certainly a woman and far from a girl, but the way those words escaped from Rio’s lips, the way she looked at her so intensely, she had no choice but to feel a shiver run down her spine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The night remained pleasant as the orchestra finished their set and thankfully (but also not), Rio had lightened up on the flirting. Soon enough they were pulling back up at Agatha’s house, but she found she didn’t want to get out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This was better than I had imagined,” she said honestly, unbuckling her seatbelt to face Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ouch,” Rio teased. “Did you have such little faith in me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled and shook her head. “No. It just was…unexpected.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I live to please,” Rio grinned, reaching out to grab Agatha’s hand in her own. “Will I see you tomorrow at my game?” she asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about it before nodding, knowing she’d want to see the woman again and Nicky would love to see her as well. “Send me the address.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As you wish,” she responded, bringing Agatha’s hand up to her mouth before kissing it. Agatha felt flutters in her stomach at the contact. It was the most contact they had since meeting and she couldn’t help but to want more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll walk you to your door,” Rio said, dropping Agatha’s hand to get out and open the door for her. Agatha smiled at the gesture and got out, following Rio up the stairs to her door, dread sinking in her stomach at the thought of her leaving.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you for tonight,” she said as they reached the door. “Oh, and your jacket,” she chuckled, forgetting she even had it on. She took it off and handed it over to Rio who slid it on, covering those arms Agatha knew she’d be having dreams about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio put her hands in her back pockets, casually shrugging. “It was the least I could do for you. You deserve to be pampered.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found herself blushing at the brazen comment. “I don’t know about that, but I do know I want to see you again. Let me take you out next time?” she asked, looking at Rio with hope in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smiled and stepped closer, placing a hand on Agatha’s cheek. “I do the taking out,” she said in a voice just on the verge of a whisper. She leaned in and placed a chaste kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth, so close to where she had wanted. Just as quickly, Rio stepped away as if she hadn’t caused turmoil in Agatha’s mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Te veo, querida,” Rio said, leaving the porch and stepping back in her car.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stared at Rio as she appeared to chuckle in her car while pulling away. Fuck, what was she getting herself into? She had never been as captivated as she was by another person like she was with Rio. To be fair, if she wanted to bring someone home they never teased her like Rio did and left her wanting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took her a second to gather herself before she let herself inside and get ready for bed. No one had ever made her feel as flustered as Rio did, leaving her wanting more every time they interacted. God, what was getting into her? She needed to tell Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Do you have plans tomorrow?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Nope, what’s up
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: You’re bringing the boys to meet me at the softball field
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Oh am I? Would a certain Spanish teacher be on said softball field?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Potentially
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: We’ll be there. I can’t wait to embarrass you in front of her. Should I tell her about that time you went skinny dipping in the campus pool and got caught by the security guard?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: I rescind my offer
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: See you tomorrow &lt;3
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      —---------------------------------
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next morning Agatha found herself taking a much longer time than usual trying to find something to wear. It was just a softball game, she didn’t need to dress up, but the thought of Rio seeing her in whatever she chose was at the forefront of her mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She ended up choosing casual jeans and a plain white t-shirt, giving the necklace Rio had given her a prominent spot around her neck. She also wore a black baseball cap, her hair hanging loose around her shoulders. It was both attractive but didn’t look like she took too much time deciding what to wear, or at least not as much time as she ended up taking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The drive to the softball field didn’t take too long and soon enough she was parked and greeted by Nicky practically tackling her with a hug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma!” he exclaimed, wrapping his little arms around her legs.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hi baby,” she said, smiling softly as she pushed some of his hair away from his forehead so she could kiss it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you have a fun time with Billy and Tommy?” she asked, taking his hand to make her way to where Wanda was standing with the twins.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mhmm. We played tag but Tommy won every time so we stopped and then we played hide and seek and Miss Wanda made us popcorn! We got to watch The Good Dinosaur!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha could see Wanda chuckling at Nicky’s excited retelling of the events from the night before as they reached the redhead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That sounds so fun,” Agatha replied, giving his hand a light squeeze of affection.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s go find some seats. I’ve got a surprise for you,” she said with a wink to both Nicky and the boys given Rio taught all three of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky let go of Agatha’s hand and ran off with the boys who were eager to find the best seats. It wasn’t like there was a plethora of people watching an adult community softball game, but the boys didn’t care.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just a surprise for the boys, huh?” Wanda asked with a knowing grin.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes and bumped her shoulder with Wanda’s. “Technically it isn’t a surprise to me given I already know she’s here,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fair enough,” Wanda chuckled as they reached the seats the boys had chosen, right in the front row of the bleachers behind home plate.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The game will start soon. Are you excited?” Agatha leaned over Wanda to speak to the excited boys.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah!” They all shouted in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled and turned to Wanda. “Were they this energetic the whole time?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda let out a teasing groan. “Yes. Thankfully they crashed around 8:00 though. It wasn’t so bad since they all occupied each other.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a plus,” Agatha replied, chuckling at the boys as they proved what Wanda had just said, the kids chatting enthusiastically between each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Wanda could reply, a booming voice came over the speaker. “Welcome folks! Are you ready for the game?” This was followed by cheering, the boys the loudest by far. “Let’s get this game started! On the outfield we have the Westview Wonders! And batting first is the Eastview Eagles! Let’s play ball!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The crowd cheered as the teams went to their positions on the field. Agatha’s eyes roamed through the various members before she spotted her guarding first base.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey boys, look at first base,” she said, leaning over Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boys squint their eyes to look out before recognition crossed their faces almost in unison.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Vidal!” They cheered. It was loud enough that Rio could hear it, indicated by the turn of her head in their direction and a wave to them. She also playfully blew a kiss to Agatha, knowing no one would really know who it was going to given the distance from the bleachers to the field.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is so cool, Mamma!” Nicky exclaimed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart warmed at the comment. At the very least it was reassurance that if she and Rio did continue their relationship, Nicky would most likely not have too much of a problem with it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game commenced and Agatha’s eyes remained glued to Rio. Sports weren’t something she had ever had much interest in, so keeping up with the game was of no importance to her. The way Rio looked in that uniform though was very important.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re staring,” a teasing voice said softly beside her so as to not risk the boys overhearing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m watching the game,” Agatha replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hm, I didn’t know the game consisted of only the right side of the field,” Wanda responded, knowing Agatha hadn’t turned her head away from first base since the moment Vidal got in position.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shut up,” Agatha groaned, knowing Wanda would continue teasing if she continued denying it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda simply chuckled in response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The batting team soon had three strikes and the teams changed positions, Westview now batting. Rio happened to be first in the lineup and Agatha immediately realized she was sitting directly behind home base meaning she’d be faced with Rio’s perfectly clad ass in those pants. Fuck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She watched as Rio walked up to the base, giving a small wave to the boys who cheered loudly for her. When she arrived at the plate, she turned to wink at Agatha and twirled her bat around before getting into position to hit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re staring again,” Wanda teased next to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn’t even have it in her to deny it. If her eyes weren’t on Rio’s backside, they were on her arms, the muscles slightly bulging from the way she held her bat up. God, she was down bad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The game went fairly the same way until it was over, the boys cheering, Wanda teasing, and Agatha only having eyes for Rio. Soon enough it was over and Agatha leaned over Wanda to address the boys. “Wanna stick around a bit to say hi to Ms. Vidal?” She asked, the boys agreeing immediately.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She chuckled and stood up, walking over to the entrance to the field to wait for Rio to exit. The boys were practically bouncing on their toes, excited to see their teacher in an environment outside school. That was like magic to them, it seemed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took entirely too long for Agatha’s liking for Rio to emerge, but when she did she had a bag with her bat sticking out slung over one shoulder, sweat clinging to her from the game. Agatha had never been more attracted to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey kiddos,” Rio said as she greeted them, bending down to the boy’s eye level. “It’s cool you guys came. I have my own little fan club now,” she chuckled before standing back up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Maximoff,” she greeted Wanda with a nod before turning her gaze to Agatha. “Ms. Harkness,” she nodded, ever the professional. Agatha had to give it to her, she was keeping her promise to not hint at anything between them in front of Nicky. That being said, it appeared she couldn’t help but to tease Agatha anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a lovely necklace,” she said, a slight smirk forming on her face. “Where did you get it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glared at her for putting her on the spot. “It was a gift,” she said simply.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Mamma’s favorite!” Nicky spoke up. “She wears it every day!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh does she now?” Rio asked, an amused eyebrow raised. “Must be a pretty special person that gave it to her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Actually they’re a bit of a pain in the ass,” Agatha replied before the boys burst out in a chorus of “Oooooo she said a bad word!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gasped dramatically. “Ms. Harkness, such crass language!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes and grabbed Nicky’s hand. “Come on, love, time to go home.” She knew if she stayed in Rio’s vicinity she would lose her control over remaining professional.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aw Mamma do we have to?” he asked, his eyes pleading with her. Normally she would cave in a second, but she had to get out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry, Mamma’s got some stuff to do at home. Tell Ms. Vidal goodbye.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Adios Ms. Vidal,” he said, slightly sad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Adios Nicky,” Rio responded, an amused glint in her eye as she glanced at Agatha. “I hope your Mamma is able to get all her work done.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shot her a glare before dragging Nicky to the car. How dare she make her flustered in front of the boys. She wasn’t truly upset, but she hated not knowing how to react whenever she was around Rio. It was as if her usual confident demeanor evaporated as soon as the other woman opened her mouth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the evening was spent in her office, pretending to do work since she used it as an excuse to leave. She groaned and opened her phone, hoping mindlessly scrolling would help her get her shit together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Of course the universe had other things in mind. A notification was waiting for her on instagram. She didn’t need to guess who it was from.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Have fun?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Well, the boys did
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Not you?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Sports aren’t my thing. I just happen to have a soft spot for one of the players
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Lucky girl
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I could feel you staring. Like what you saw?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Very much
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      No point in lying at this point. She knew Rio would just point it out anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: That’s what I like to hear
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I also like to hear you had on ‘Mamma’s favorite necklace’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: You already know that
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Still nice to see. I like having a claim on you, Agatha
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Technically Rio already had that without the necklace, but she wasn’t about to share that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: So you’ve said
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I know. I just like reminding you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: You’re the worst
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I am but you love it
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And god damn if she didn’t.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Sunday flew by, Agatha taking Nicky out to the park, feeling bad she hadn’t spent as much time with him recently because of the date. She doubted her kid felt neglected, but it didn’t ease the slight guilt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Early Monday morning however, Agatha was awoken by a tug on her arm. She blinked her eyes open, groggy from waking up at whatever ungodly hour it was. Given it was still dark outside, it was too early in her books.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She shifted around in bed to see Nicky holding his favorite stuffed dinosaur. “What’s wrong, baby?” she asked, still attempting to wake up but knowing he wouldn’t wake her up for no reason.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t feel good,” he whimpered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned and placed the back of her hand against his forehead. Fuck, he was burning up. She sat up in bed and stood up, picking her child up to carry him to the bathroom where her thermometer was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Open up, Mamma wants to see how hot you are,” she asked softly. Nicky clutched the stuffed animal like his life depended on it but allowed Agatha to put the thermometer in his mouth. She glanced down at it and frowned as the number grew higher and higher. 103 ℉. Fuck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What’s hurting you?” she probed Nicky, trying to figure out why his temperature was so high.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “M-my head. And my body hurts,” he sniffled. It sounded like the flu. She sighed and wrapped him in her arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s going to be alright, my love. Let’s go downstairs and I’ll get you some medicine, okay? It’s the kind that tastes like oranges.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky faintly smiled and nodded, allowing Agatha to carry him downstairs. “I like that kind.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It hurt her heart to see her baby not feeling good, knowing she couldn’t immediately ease his pain. She’d take it tenfold if it meant that he would feel better.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sat Nicky on the couch before going off to grab the medicine and some water to bring back to him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s going to be okay, baby,” she reassured him again. “I’ll lay down with you down here and tomorrow we can both stay in our pajamas and watch movies all day. How does that sound?” she asked, gently running her fingers through his hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, Mamma,” he murmured, shifting to lay down. Agatha laid down beside him, wrapping her arms around her little boy. She hummed “The Ballad of the Witches’ Road” to him, hoping it eased him to sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha waited a few minutes to make sure he was asleep before she slid out from behind him and went back to her room to grab her phone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Nicky has the flu, just a heads up in case the boys start feeling bad.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Surprisingly Wanda wrote back, though it shouldn’t have been too much of a shock. She knew Wanda suffered from insomnia and couldn’t always get sleep.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: Oh gosh, the poor bud. Do you need me to bring you anything?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha thought about it before responding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: Would you mind dropping off some gatorade?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda: I’m on it. I’ll bring it over once I drop the boys off
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha: You’re a lifesaver
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha locked the phone and went back to the couch to stay with Nicky in case he woke up needing something. At some point she must have ended up falling asleep because the next thing she knew there was a knock  on her door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky seemed to also be waking up , but she told him it would be okay. “It’s just Miss Wanda bringing over some stuff for you,” Agatha said softly, getting up from the couch. That seemed to ease his curiosity and he laid back down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked to the door, greeting Wanda with a tired hello.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How’s he doing?” Wanda asked, handing off the drinks.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, glancing back at the couch to the tired little boy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s got a high fever and body aches. It could be worse, but it certainly isn’t great.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda gave Agatha an empathetic look. “Let him know I hope he gets better soon,” she replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded and watched as Wanda left. She frowned, knowing school had already started at this point. Fuck, she should probably let Rio know he wouldn’t be able to have tutoring.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked back to the couch and sat at the end of it, pulling up her messages with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Hey, Nicky is home with the flu so he won’t be able to have tutoring today.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She wasn’t expecting Rio to reply quickly, but she soon received a response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Oh no! Do you need anything??
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her heart warmed at the offer, knowing Rio cared about Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: It’s okay. Wanda brought over some stuff earlier
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Who?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Wanda Maximoff
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Oh. You two seem to spend a lot of time together..
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her brows at the comment, unsure of where Rio was going with this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark:We do, we’ve been friends since college
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Just friends?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh. Was Rio jealous? Interesting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: We dated for a bit and hooked up off and on since
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Off and on? When was the last time?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: The night I met you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch:  …What?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: I wanted to find a distraction so I would stop thinking about you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Well, did it work?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snorted, enjoying being the one that threw the other off for once.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      MotherHark: Clearly not
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: Good. You’re mine, Agatha Harkness
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As if the other woman hadn’t already made that abundantly clear. Despite that, seeing the message still shot desire through her body as if it were the first time. She didn’t know how to respond, so she didn’t and turned her attention to Nicky by her side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The majority of the day was a mix of making sure her kid got fluids in him, watching movies, and Nicky resting. Before she knew it, it was evening already. She helped him take a cold bath, hoping it would help with his temperature before she took a shower of her own.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was just getting ready to sit with him on the couch again to watch another movie when there was a knock on the door. Agatha raised an eyebrow, confused as to who could be knocking since Wanda had already come around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She got up and opened it, surprised to see Rio standing at the other side with a big pot of what appeared to be soup.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I made caldo de pollo. It’s my abuelita’s recipe and always helped me feel better,” she said in greeting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha was still confused, but allowed Rio to come in. “When did you have time to make this?” she asked, following Rio to the kitchen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I may have taken a sick day when you messaged me,” Rio replied with a shrug.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma, who’s here?” A voice called from the living room. Well, how was she supposed to explain this?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let me,” Rio said softly to Agatha, holding up a hand to prevent her from responding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked to the living room and sat down in front of the couch to look at Nicky.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ms. Vidal?” he asked in a weak voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It's me, amigo. Your Mamma told me you were sick and I brought over some soup for you. I can’t have my star student missing class. Imagine all the stickers waiting for you,” she said, a soft smile gracing her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s heart melted at the exchange. Whatever worry she had about Nicky interacting with Rio in her home was dashed when she saw how happy he was that she was present.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m your favorite?” he asked, perking up slightly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled and leaned forward, stage whispering to the boy. “Don’t tell anyone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky broke out into a wide grin, causing Agatha to replicate the expression. Seeing how sweet Rio was with Nicky made her like her even more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky chuckled at their shared secret and mimicked locking his lips. “I won’t tell.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. I’m going to go talk to your Mamma about how to serve the soup now, okay? Feel better, chiquito.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicky nodded and yawned, snuggling into the couch while Rio made her way back to the privacy of the kitchen with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was really sweet of you,” Agatha said once Rio returned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio simply shrugged, a lazy smile on her lips. “I wasn’t lying. He’s a smart one, the little guy. Plus, I do happen to have a soft spot for his mother,” she responded, moving to gently grab Agatha by the hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mm, I bet you say that to all the moms of sick kids,” Agatha teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, just you,” Rio responded honestly, leaning in to kiss Agatha’s forehead, causing Agatha’s heart to speed up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you,” she said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lifted a hand to cup Agatha’s face as she spoke. “De nada, querida.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stood like that for a few extra moments before Rio pulled away. “I don’t have any plans tonight. Do you need anything? Have you been able to take care of yourself?” she asked honestly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glanced down and shook her head, knowing Rio wouldn’t like the answer.. “I haven’t eaten but it’s okay. I’ve been making sure Nicky is alright.’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha,” Rio said, her voice stern. “You can’t take care of Nicky if you’re not taking care of yourself. Sit,” she commanded, nodding to the chair at the kitchen island.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew not to disobey and followed the order, watching as Rio took command of the kitchen. She put the pot of soup she brought on the stove, turning it on to heat it up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where’s your cups?” she asked, following as Agatha pointed to a cabinet. She filled a glass up with water and set it in front of her. “Drink.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If Agatha was prepared for Rio to be in her kitchen commanding her to do various things, she would have found a snarky comment to throw back, but seeing as the woman just showed up at her door with no warning, all preparation was out the window. She sipped at the water while Rio rummaged through the kitchen drawers to find a ladle.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m staying here tonight,” Rio stated, breaking the silence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s mouth dropped open at the comment. “You wha-?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked over to Agatha’s seat, standing behind it. She gripped Agatha’s shoulders, massaging them gently. “I’m staying here tonight,” she repeated, the unexpected yet welcomed touch causing Agatha to let out a soft sigh verging on the edge of a moan. “If Nicky needs anything, I’ll do it. You need to rest,” Rio continued.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It didn’t make much sense to Agatha but the last half hour hadn’t so what was more?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What would I tell him in the morning?” Agatha asked, leaning into the touch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If he doesn’t need anything at night then he won’t even know I was here. I’ll slip out in the morning. If he does, I’ll figure something out.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Given how easily she convinced Nicky it was normal for her to show up with food, she didn’t doubt Rio’s ability to discuss why she had spent the night.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay,” Agatha conceded. “I’ll get the guest room ready for you.” She began to move, attempting to get up, but Rio’s hands tightened on her shoulders, keeping her in place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s not necessary. I’ll be with you in your room.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s mouth dropped open again, unsure of how to respond.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re not doing anything, I just want to make sure you’re actually trying to rest and not worrying about Nicky,” Rio explained, her grip loosening again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned around in the chair to look up at the teacher. “Thank you, Rio,” she said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm, I’m protective over what is mine,” Rio husked, leaning down to place a kiss on the top of Agatha’s still damp hair from her shower. “And I need you well rested to keep up with me,” she continued, a teasing smirk crossing her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ah, there she was, the Rio Agatha was used to. She chuckled and shook her head. “You are an enigma, Vidal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Damn right I am,” Rio declared in a confident tone.
     </span>

<span>
      Rio stayed true to her word, not that Agatha had any doubts. She ensured that both Agatha and Nicky had their share of the soup and while the mother was helping Nicky into his bed, Rio waited in Agatha’s bedroom, since Nicky was unaware she had stayed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sleep tight, my love,” she whispered, kissing him on his forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “G’night Mamma,” he whispered in return. His fever was still present, she checked before tucking him in, but it had gone down, which was a good sign.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha left the room and made her way to her own bedroom, noticing Rio perched on the edge of her bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you need something to change into?” Agatha asked, still feeling as if this were a dream and not reality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That would be nice,” Rio agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded and quickly grabbed some comfortable shorts and a Stark Industries t-shirt to hand over to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stark Industries, huh? I never pegged you as a corporate rat,” Rio said, noticing the print on the shirt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes at the comment. “I’m the PR manager. Less a rat, more a firefighter given all the fires I’ve had to put out
      <em>
       because
      </em>
      of the corporate rats.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio smirked at that. “Mmm, well I do love a lady in uniform.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re incorrigible,” Agatha chuckled, sliding under the sheets.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And you love it,” Rio replied easily, leaving no room for Agatha to answer as the teacher left to change in the bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      If anyone had asked her how she expected her day to end, she certainly would not have predicted Rio insisting on staying the night to make sure she slept. It was still hard for herself to believe yet there she was, lying down, waiting for Rio to reemerge from the bathroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the thought crossed her mind, the door opened and Rio stepped out, looking unfairly attractive in the plain clothes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is not how I imagined our first night together,” Agatha commented, watching Rio cross the room to shut off the lights.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh? Tell me what you imagined” Rio teased. Agatha couldn’t see her face clearly, her eyes still adjusting to the darkness, but she knew Rio would be smirking.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Less clothes for one,” Agatha answered. “Also preferably without my son down the hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled and slid into the bed next to Agatha. “Fair enough.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shifted and turned to face Rio, feeling both intimate and comfortable. She wouldn’t mind having Rio in her bed more often.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What are you thinking about?” Rio asked, reaching out to tuck a stray strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s so weird but also so familiar to have you here,” she said honestly. “I like it, but my mind is still catching up with the fact that you’re here with me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled softly at the comment. “You’re going to have to get used to my spontaneous moments of affection,” she replied with a smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wouldn’t mind it,” Agatha grinned in return.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come here,” Rio said softly, opening up her arms for Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman didn’t even think twice as she slid over to Rio’s embrace, her back facing Rio’s front. She had never been the little spoon but with Rio it felt natural.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio rested her chin on Agatha’s shoulder, her arms easily wrapping around her torso. “You’ve got a hold on me, Harkness. You cast a spell on me and now I’m never letting go.” She turned her head slightly to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s neck, causing the older woman’s breath to hitch.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m no witch,” Agatha responded, her voice soft. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you were though. You’ve done something to me, I’m convinced.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did tell you I always get what I want,” Rio replied easily. “Now get some sleep. I’m not going anywhere.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wasn’t sure how she’d be able to fall asleep with Rio wrapped around her the way she was, her intoxicating scent invading her senses, but she drifted off easily, worn out from the day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next thing Agatha knew, Rio was shaking her awake gently.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Morning, brujita,” the dark-eyed woman said softly.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha groaned, turning to shove her face in Rio’s neck. It was too early to wake up and Rio was too comfortable to leave the bed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Rio chuckled, Agatha could feel it reverberate through her body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I gotta go,” Rio continued, running her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “Nicky didn’t come in last night so I have to leave before he wakes up. Unless you want to explain why I’m still here,” she teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha knew it was best for Rio to slip out, but that didn’t mean she wanted her to. She sighed and pulled away from the teacher, unashamedly pouting at the action. “I’ll miss you,” she whispered. Perhaps when she was more awake she’d be embarrassed about being so open but right now all she wanted was to keep Rio close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll miss you too, Agatha,” Rio replied, slipping out of bed. “I’m keeping the t-shirt by the way. It’s too comfortable to take off.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grinned at the idea of Rio keeping something of hers. She had no argument against it. “You’d keep it whether or not I said so,” she chuckled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know me so well,” Rio replied, grabbing her clothes from the day before. “I’ll be going to work today, but if you need anything please tell me,” she said, moving forward to cup Agatha’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean ask you instead of Wanda?” she asked, smirking as she remembered the sense of jealousy hinted at the day before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes darkened, her hand moving down to grip Agatha’s chin. “I mean instead of anyone.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So bossy,” Agatha responded, enjoying the way Rio was responding.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m protective over what’s mine,” Rio shrugged, pulling her hand away from Agatha. “I mean it though. Tell me if you need anything.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, missing the contact already. “I will. Thank you, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed as she watched Rio leave, knowing it was what needed to happen but it still made her sad. Despite wanting to take things slow, she found herself falling fast and honestly she didn’t mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The rest of the day went by fairly smoothly. Nicky’s fever thankfully broke at some point during the night, but Agatha wanted to keep him home an extra day to make sure it stayed down. Given he was feeling slightly better, she was able to spend one-on-one time with him which was nice. They watched his favorite movies and she even gave him some ice cream after he finished more of the soup Rio had left for them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The next day Agatha felt good enough about Nicky’s health that she took him back to school, much to his excitement. She dropped him off at school and made her way to Rio’s classroom, wanting to see the teacher since she hadn’t the day before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Miss me already?” Rio asked, head popping up from where she sat at her desk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chuckled and nodded, she couldn’t deny it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course. It wasn’t as fun sleeping alone last night,” she admitted without shame.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio got up from her desk and walked over to close the classroom door, preventing people from overhearing the conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’d happily sleep with you whenever you need me,” she husked, walking back to where Agatha was standing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You mean it?” Agatha asked, unsure if the woman was teasing her or not.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I don’t say things I don’t mean,” Rio replied, gently grabbing Agatha’s hips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And if I said I want you to come over tonight?” Agatha asked hopefully.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned in, her lips a breath away from Agatha’s. “I’d ask what took you so long to ask me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s breath hitched and her mind short circuited. Fuck it, she thought. Nicky liked Rio and she clearly liked him as well. It would be worth it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she could convince herself not to, Agatha closed the distance between them, her hands reaching up to cup Rio’s face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The younger woman stood still for a moment before quickly returning the kiss. She reached a hand up to grab Agatha’s wrist, not to push her away but to pull her closer, keep her in place.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s tongue gently ran along Agatha’s lower lip and the blue-eyed woman allowed her in without hesitation. She couldn’t help but to let out a soft moan at the sensation, causing Rio to pause and step away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck, Harkness,” she whispered, her voice breathy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t plan for the first time we did that to be in the school,” Agatha chuckled softly, her eyes scanning over Rio’s lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I didn’t plan for you to be the one to do it,” Rio quipped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, you took too long,” she said without shame. “See you tonight?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nothing could pull me away from you tonight, brujita.”
     </span>

      The wait for the end of the day was excruciating. Agatha had to sit through Tony blabbing about how he is the best in the industry, and even though it may be true, he could really benefit from learning to be more humble. She had picked Nicky up from tutoring without much incident, though Rio did wink at her as she was walking out of the classroom, a reminder of what was to come, as if she could forget.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soon enough, though it had felt like forever, she was tucking Nicky in bed. She wasn’t entirely sure when Rio planned to get there, but Agatha wanted to take some time to change from the usual pajamas she wore around her son to something more appealing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha walked back to her bedroom and rummaged through her options, finding flaws with each and every one, until she glanced at her bathroom door. She had a floral robe hanging up that she normally wore in the mornings that just might work. Agatha stripped from her clothes and put the robe on, completely bare beneath. Was it too forward? Maybe, but she was so tired of being caught off guard by Rio’s intense flirting that she thought it would be her turn.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ItsRioBitch: I’m here. Don’t want to knock on the door and wake Nicky up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Perfect timing. Agatha made her way downstairs and opened the door for Rio. The woman was immaculate. She was bare faced, her hair flowing in gentle waves that framed her face perfectly, wearing simple flannel pajama pants and a baggy Westview Wonders crewneck. It was simple, but nothing ever looked just simple on Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look at you,” Rio smirked, walking through the doorway as if she belonged there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mm, what about me?” Agatha teased, grabbing Rio’s hand to pull her along to the bedroom.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll show you in a second,” the teacher husked beneath her breath.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The comment made Agatha walk even faster to the bedroom, causing Rio to chuckle. She shut the door gently so as to not disturb Nicky and turned to face the dark-eyed enigma.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t know just how long I’ve waited for this, Agatha,” Rio whispered intently, her pupils dilating as she pulled Agatha close to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m guessing just about as long as I have,” the older woman responded, wrapping her arms around Rio’s neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They needed no further discussion. Rio leaned in and pulled Agatha into a deep kiss. It wasn’t urgent, despite the comments from before, they had all night and both intended to use it well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands roamed over Agatha’s robe, sliding up the sides as if she were trying to memorize the shape of her form. She continued until she was cupping the older woman’s face, pulling a soft moan from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They broke for a moment, foreheads resting against each other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can I take this off for you?” Rio asked Agatha, her fingers roaming over the tie of the robe. Agatha was surprised by the question, used to Rio telling her what she would do rather than asking permission. Not that she would have minded being told, but it was sweet she asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha nodded, stepping back just slightly to allow Rio to untie it. The teacher took her time before gently sliding the robe off Agatha’s shoulders, her breath hitching at the sight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Eres tan preciosa,” Rio whispered, her eyes slowly taking in every inch of the older woman. Normally Agatha would be self-conscious at the scrutiny she was receiving, but the way Rio’s eyes darkened told her all she needed to know.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She stepped forward, her fingers idly fidgeting with the bottom of Rio’s sweater. “My turn?” she asked, her blue eyes searching Rio’s dark orbs for permission. Rio simply nodded in response, lifting her arms to assist in removing the garment.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha slid off the sweater and gently pulled down her pajama bottoms as well. She shouldn’t have been surprised to see Rio was wearing nothing beneath either article, but her insides burned all the same at the realization.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood up and swallowed hard, eyes roaming every part of the woman from her pert breasts to the tattoo previously hidden by clothing directly on her hip. It was an azalea, something that seemed to fit her. She was sure Rio would tell her the meaning behind it, but that was a question for another time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want to take my time with you but fuck, it’s really hard not to push you on the bed and cave,” Rio husked, fingers fidgeting at her sides as if resisting to do just what she had said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We have all night,” Agatha responded. “There’s plenty of time for both.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took that as permission and closed the distance between them, reaching down to cup Agatha’s ass before lifting her up and onto the bed. The older woman let out a surprised yelp, not expecting the surprising strength.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled and climbed on the bed, straddling Agatha’s prone form before putting her thumb on Agatha’s lips. “Shh, mi amor. I don’t think you want Nicky walking in on this, hm?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She absolutely did not. Agatha shook her head before parting her lips slightly, taking the digit shushing her into her mouth. If Rio’s eyes weren’t already dark, they certainly were now at the sight before her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vas a ser la muerte de mí,” the younger woman whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha released Rio’s finger, her hands moving to grip the teacher’s thighs. “You know I don’t know what you’re saying,” she chuckled softly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll teach you,” Rio responded simply, leaning down to pull Agatha in a searing kiss. She took no time allowing her hands to roam down her chest, palming a breast which pulled a moan from the older woman. Now that she had permission, she had no need to hold back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio broke the kiss, pressing hot kisses down Agatha’s jaw. She intended to eventually cover every inch of Agatha’s body one day, but for the moment she had a job to complete. She kissed her way down Agatha’s neck and down to her collarbone, looking up at the older woman as she bit down, intending to leave a mark. Even if she and Agatha would be the only people seeing it, she now had a reminder of who belonged to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck, Rio,” Agatha moaned, her back arching at the unexpected but very welcome pain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m getting there,” Rio couldn’t help but to reply, her teasing nature not entirely absent from the interaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wanted to retort to the snark, but she was rendered speechless when she felt Rio’s lips latch on her nipple, her warm tongue circling it in a way that should be outlawed. It may have been the hardest thing in her life when she suppressed the noise that threatened to leave her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman’s hands wrapped around Rio’s back, her nails digging in slightly as a sign to encourage her further. Rio responded accordingly, a moan reverberating against Agatha’s chest as she switched to the other breast, intending to give each equal attention. She reached a hand up to cover Agatha’s mouth, knowing she may let noise escape when she couldn’t stop herself from biting down slightly, her tongue quickly following to ease the pain.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She quickly learned that was a great choice, as Agatha’s mouth opened to release a guttural moan. The noise alone could have pushed Rio to orgasm, she immediately thought. She knew Agatha could tell what it did to her as well given she was still straddling her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lowered herself further, her face finally between Agatha’s thighs and fuck, she was the most perfect woman ever. She leaned in to nip at the sensitive skin on the inside of Agatha’s thighs, unable to resist teasing the woman knowing she wanted more than just that. The older woman twined her hand in Rio’s hair, nails gently scraping her scalp as she attempted to nudge her where she needed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Patience,” Rio teased, biting down a little harder this time on Agatha’s thigh, knowing it wouldn’t hurt too much but it was enough to leave yet another mark. God, she would cover Agatha in marks by the time the sun rose if she had the choice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now is not the fucking time for that,” Agatha retorted, her previous bewilderment around the teacher gone now that they were in their current situation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio simply chuckled lowly but complied, running her tongue up the older woman’s slit. She couldn’t suppress her own moan after getting a taste. God, everything about this woman was perfect.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hand tightened in Rio’s hair as the teacher leaned back in, paying special attention to the sensitive bundle of nerves she knew would drive the older woman crazy. Her tongue traced Agatha’s name around her clit, the blue eyed woman very clearly attempting to muffle her moans but was not doing the best job.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit her bottom lip, potentially leaving marks but it was the lesser of two evils given Nicky was just down the hall. The things Rio was doing to her body were sinful and she would happily follow her to hell if that meant they could continue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fingers,” Agatha managed to mutter, causing Rio to look up at her with an eyebrow raised in amusement. She complied though, much to the older woman’s pleasure. Rio slid two fingers into her center, mouth never leaving its position. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Embarrassingly it didn’t take much longer with Rio’s devilishly lithe fingers curling exactly where she needed before she came undone, a deep guttural moan escaping her lips. Rio continued until Agatha’s panting let up and made her way back up to face the older woman. As she stared into those beautiful blue eyes, she took the fingers in her mouth, cleaning them off before releasing them with a soft pop.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m never letting you go, Agatha Harkness,” Rio husked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked and hooked her leg around the teacher’s body, using her strength to flip their positions. “Who said I’d let you if you tried?” she responded, her lips hovering over Rio’s.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ay, mierda,” the dark-eyed woman replied.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m getting there,” Agatha teased, echoing Rio’s response to the English phrase muttered by herself earlier. She may not know much Spanish, but one does not go through public school without learning common vulgar words in other languages.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked impressed at the recognition of the words but had no time to comment on it, presumably to tease her, as Agatha leaned down and kissed her eagerly. She kissed her as if her life depended on it, open mouthed, her tongue slipping in to run along the roof of Rio’s mouth tasting remnants of herself. She may have been shy before, but she had no need now. She was certainly confident in her abilities when it came to pleasing women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha slid her thigh between Rio’s, pressing against her center. Rio immediately pressed against it, rolling her hips for more friction. The older woman chuckled into the teacher’s mouth before pulling away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened to patience?” she teased.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pressed her tongue to the side of her cheek at being called out. “I never said it applied to me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh?” Agatha asked, pulling her thigh away.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio whined, apparently showing her true side in bed. A brat, it appeared. Interesting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rules go both ways…querida.” Agatha ran her tongue along Rio’s bottom lip, pulling away when the younger woman tried to pull her in. She pouted, somehow making it look both cute and sexy. Agatha almost wanted to give in, but her excitement at seeing Rio in such a vulnerable position overruled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I bet I barely need to touch you for you to come undone,” Agatha husked, her thigh moving back to Rio’s core just long enough for the teacher to roll her hips again before pulling away once more.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Por favor. Te necesito,” she whined once more. God, Agatha could get used to this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mm, I like to play with my meals, Vidal.” She knew it would drive Rio crazy making her wait which was exactly her motivation to do so.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s nails trailed lightly along Rio’s sides, up and around her chest before she palmed each breast. Rio responded immediately, her chest rising to add more pressure and encourage Agatha to continue, not that the older woman needed encouragement.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tweaked one of Rio’s dusky nipples, causing her to whine in response. Seeing her like this made up for the turmoil all her teasing caused Agatha previously, the sense of control and power by her own doing giving her much satisfaction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I swear to god, Agatha,” Rio muttered, her arms grabbing the older woman to attempt to pull her closer, to increase the friction.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No gods here, pretty girl, just me.” Agatha leaned in and ran her tongue along the jawline that had been haunting her thoughts ever since she laid eyes on her son’s teacher. Rio lifted her chin, tilting it to the side to expose her neck. Agatha took that as permission to nip and suck at the bare skin. If Rio thought she would leave marks on the older woman, the teacher had another thing coming. She’d have to wear a turtleneck for a week at minimum.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her thigh went back to where Rio desperately needed her and this time Agatha allowed it to remain, giving her the slightest bit of pity. The noises she had been making were just irresistible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “¡Gracias, gracias, gracias! Nunca volveré a burlarme de ti, lo p-prometo, solo te necesito ahora mismo,” Rio pleaded, the words falling on deaf ears as Agatha understood nothing besides the first three, but she felt she partly understood the gist.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her hips in time with Rio’s, allowing her the pressure the teacher had been craving. Her thigh was slick at this point, sliding easily against the younger woman. It was heaven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha kissed and nipped her way up to the shell of Rio’s ear, whispering gently. “I’m going to make you cum for me just like this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It appeared Rio had no complaints, as the only response she received was the mix of moans and whines escaping the teacher’s lips. Agatha took the woman’s earlobe between her teeth and tugged gently, sending desire shooting straight through Rio’s body.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The older woman pulled Rio in for a kiss once more as her hand roamed lower, circling around the teacher’s clit. She eagerly swallowed the younger woman’s moans, savoring the noises she pulled from her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha increased the pressure of her thigh and Rio’s steady rhythm increased before she shuddered, hips jerking against the older woman as she rode out the high. Agatha kept her thigh where it was until Rio slumped against the bed. Only then did she break the kiss, sliding off of the teacher to study her expressions as she laid on her side, head propped on her hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It took a few minutes for Rio’s breathing to return to normal. Once it did, her head turned to look at Agatha in prideful awe. “I had no idea you had that in you, brujita.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smirked at the compliment and reached over with her free hand to cup Rio’s cheek. “I have so much more than that. I intend to show you over and over and over,” she replied, fingers tapping against Rio’s cheek with each repeated word.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio stared up at the ceiling, absorbing the words. “Agatha Harkness, I think I’m in love with you,” she muttered, a small chuckle escaping her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m pretty fond of you too, darling.”

      Agatha awoke to the sun shining in her face. She groaned and turned, intending to wrap her arms around Rio but was faced with an empty bed. She frowned and sat up. Typically when Rio was not in bed she was out on a run but the teacher hadn’t mentioned anything about planning to go on one the night before.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She sighed and slid on her robe, tying it at her waist before she made her way downstairs, intending to seek out her girlfriend. As she approached the kitchen, she could hear music being sung off-key.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She smiled and entered the room, finding Nicky sitting at the kitchen island singing along to his new obsession while Rio used a spatula as a microphone to join in, her hips shimmying in time with the music.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Bidi bidi bom bom! Bidi bidi bom bom!” the boy sang, though in reality it was more of an excited yell. She couldn’t help but to chuckle at the scene before her. If someone asked her a year ago if she anticipated her son singing along to music in Spanish with his teacher in her home, she would have asked if they had just been released from the psychiatric unit at Westview Medical Center, yet here she was.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio turned to look at Agatha, hearing the chuckle that came from her, and held her hand out, motioning for her to come join. The older woman rolled her eyes but danced her way over to them and sang along.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio moved to stand behind Agatha and rest her chin on the woman’s shoulder as they continued moving their hips along to the beat. “I was hoping you’d be in bed a bit longer,” she muttered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow in question, knowing Rio would know she was doing so even if she couldn’t see her face from their position. “And why is that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was planning on serving you breakfast in bed, but our little guy asked for a jam session and I couldn’t say no,” she chuckled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their little guy. That was a new phrase Rio had been using recently and each time she did it made Agatha’s heart warm. She had no doubt Rio loved Nicky and it was very much reciprocated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mamma, we wanted to s’prise you!” Nicky pouted, but only briefly. The boy couldn’t stop himself from smiling and resuming the song. “Mamita was making pancakes but she burnt the first one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! That was supposed to be our little secret,” Rio said, pointing the spatula at the boy accusingly. Nicky simply giggled in response.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That was new as well. Nicky had started calling Rio ‘Mamita’ a few months after the woman moved in with them. It was a bit of a surprise at first, but it was a welcome one.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mmm, a surprise of burnt pancakes in bed. What more could a woman ask for?” Agatha teased, turning her head to kiss Rio’s cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shh,” Rio muttered, putting her hand over Agatha’s mouth. “I wanted it to be an anniversary surprise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      One year. It seemed longer but also as if it flew by at the same time. Rio had seemed to come barreling into their lives and attached herself to them like a bear to honey. Neither Agatha nor Nicky had any complaints.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned around to face Rio, whispering so Nicky couldn’t hear. “You can make up for it tonight, how about that?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s eyes darkened with desire almost immediately and she didn’t stop herself from leaning forward and kissing the older woman. “I’ll do more than make up for it, I promise you that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Eeeewwww!” Nicky said with a giggle, scrunching his face in fake disgust at the display of affection from his two mothers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised teasingly. “You don’t like kisses? Uh oh, that’s not good for you because I heard you’re overdue on a bunch of them.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Nicky could scramble off his seat, Rio and Agatha approached him from either side, attacking his cheeks and head with kisses, Rio tickling him as well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boy squealed in delight, laughter coming out of him as he squirmed. “No más! No más!” the kid giggled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The adults listened and pulled away, each family member chuckling at the giddiness of simply being close and sharing time together. Agatha couldn’t help herself from giving the boy one last kiss on the top of his head, her arms wrapping around both the boy and her girlfriend. This wasn’t the family she ever imagined herself having when she was younger, but it was the family she had and she would happily do it all over again to have them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Te amo,” Agatha whispered, hugging the two close.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Te amo,” the two pieces of her heart responded.
     </span>
