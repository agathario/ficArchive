<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“HURRY UP”</p><p>Rio hears her best friend Alice scream from the bright red Jeep parked in her driveway.</p><p>Rio was running late, like really late. She sprinted to the bedroom to do one last look, making sure she grabbed her duffle bag, phone charger, and backpack. After saying her final goodbyes to her plant babies, she locked the front door behind her and hopped in the car.</p><p>“ You know, one day I am totally going to leave without you right?”</p><p>“ Maybe, but that day is not today.” Rio shot back cheekily.</p><p>—</p><p>After driving down the length of the Cape, they finally arrived in Provincetown– the gay capital of Massachusetts, and the destination of the Bachelorette party she was currently attending. The driveway to their rented house was already packed with cars, meaning they were most likely the last to arrive.</p><p>From the outside, the house is objectively gorgeous. The windows are tinted but vast. This house was clearly recently built, with contemporary minimalist design in mind. Definitely not Rio’s cup of tea, but she’s not the one getting married so what does she care?</p><p>The backyard of the house is the beach, and Rio is already getting the itch to dive headfirst into some waves as the sun relentlessly beats down on her.</p><p>Rio and Alice headed through the front door, where they were met with loud pop music playing over someone’s JBL speaker and the girls getting ready to head to the beach.</p><p>There were some faces Rio recognized, like Jen, Alice’s fiance, and Wanda, Alice’s friend from work. They were both working on drink mixing in the kitchen. She walked up to the two of them and gave them both big hugs, asking them about their drives. Standing next to Wanda was a redhead Rio had never seen before. She was tall with short hair and a daring red one piece swimsuit clung to her lean but muscular frame.</p><p>Wanda tracked Rio’s eyes and introduced the stranger to Rio as Natasha, another friend from work.</p><p>Rio said her pleasantries and moved on without a second thought, heading down the hallway of the massive house. She turned the corner but stopped in her tracks when a familiar figure caught her eye.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>
  <em>Agatha Harkness.</em>
</p><p>To say she had a little crush on her would be the understatement of the century.</p><p>She was bent over the table at the end of the hallway, applying lip gloss in the mirror that was hanging from the wall. She was in a skimpy emerald green two piece, with a sheer purple cover up that did nothing to hide her body.</p><p>Rio tried to remember how to breathe as Agatha turned around and squealed in excitement upon seeing her. The younger girl ran up to Rio, jumping into her arms and planting a chaste, friendly kiss on her cheek.</p><p>Agatha’s long hair was down in waves, and the quick movements made her scent envelop all of Rio’s thoughts. Suddenly Rio had no problem taking a deep breath in as she wrapped her arms around her waist, pulling Agatha even closer towards her.</p><p>Agatha and Jen had been randomly assigned roommates freshman year of college, just like Alice and Rio. Alice and Jen had met in one of their classes and the four of them became fast friends. Eventually Jen and Alice started dating, leaving Rio and Agatha to be their very willing third and fourth wheels.</p><p>And while Rio was hopelessly into Agatha, it never felt like the right time. One of them was always in a relationship, and Rio didn’t want to risk ruining the friendship. Right before college ended, Rio had decided that she would rather keep Agatha as a friend than risk not being able to have her in her life at all. She would happily take her anyway she could have her, even if she would always secretly want more.</p><p>Agatha pulled away from their hug, but stayed close enough that Rio could feel soft puffs of breath gliding over her skin. The younger girl looked up at Rio through her thick lashes, blue eyes shining brightly in the light flooding in through the massive windows of the home.</p><p>“Took you guys long enough to get here.” Agatha huffed, her warm smile twisting into a teasing smirk.</p><p>“Well you know Alice. We were going five miles under the speed limit the entire ride here.” Rio joked as her hands slid from Agatha’s back down her arms.<br />While Alice looked like a dangerous woman, dressed in leather jackets and spiked chokers, streaks in her hair dyed bright red, she was actually the most responsible of them all. She had the reputation as the mom of the group, always the one making sure people were buckled in when they got in the car, forcing everyone to drink water during long nights out. Alice is a caring and protective force in their lives, and they love it, even if they tease her for being a little too much sometimes.</p><p>“ YEAH AND THAT’S WHY WE MADE IT HERE SAFE THANK YOU.” Alice yelled from the kitchen. “ You can never trust Massachusetts drivers..” she grumbled.</p><p>Agatha and Rio looked back at each other and busted out laughing, already used to Alice’s feelings towards tourists and ‘Massholes’ alike.</p><p>“ Come on, let me show you to our room.” Agatha said, as she grabbed Rio’s hand and led her towards the stairs.</p><p>“Our room?” Rio repeated curiously, following Agatha obediently. “ I thought you would be sharing with Wanda…”.</p><p>“Yeah… about that… dear Wands and I called it about 3 weeks ago. She’s actually already found herself a new girl to play with. Natalie or something... You didn’t see her downstairs?”.</p><p>Rio’s mind goes blank for a second. Agatha is single. Rio is single. The first time these facts have been true at the same time in the past three years. And they are sharing a room for the weekend.</p><p>All Rio can manage to get out is “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha pushes open the door to their shared room and Rio completely malfunctions. Scratch sharing a room. They have now upgraded to sharing a bed.</p><p>
  <em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>Agatha saunters further into the room, tossing her lip gloss back in her makeup bag. Rio stands stockstill in the doorway, duffle bag still in hand, unsure of what her face is doing.</p><p>She clears her throat and forces herself to move, heading to the side of the room that does not have Agatha’s stuff all over it.</p><p>Agatha must have noticed Rio’s hesitation, as she clears her throat and speaks up “ Yeah sorry about the one bed thing. I got here first and it was either this or two twin beds. I did not want to give Wanda and Noami the satisfaction of having the nice queen to themselves, soo…”. Agatha trails off, trying to laugh it off, but Rio can tell that there is something unsaid there. This breakup must have really hurt Agatha despite the fact that they were only together for a few months, Rio thinks to herself.</p><p>“No worries here.. I’m just going to get changed into my swimsuit now..”.</p><p>Rio curses herself for being so awkward as she grabs her suit from out of her bag and heads to their ensuite bathroom. She gives one last nod to Agatha before she shuts the door, pressing her body against it and taking a deep breath.</p><p>This is going to be a long weekend.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio looks at herself in the bathroom mirror. She is wearing short black swimming trunks, a simple black bikini top, and an open white linen button up shirt as a cover up. The top half of her hair is back in a small bun, while the rest of it falls loosely around her shoulders. She slides her sandals on, takes one last breath, and heads back into their shared room.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Agatha says, sensing Rio’s presence. She looks up from her phone and her eyes go wide, blazing a path down Rio’s body as she takes in her beach wear. Suddenly, Rio is happy she bought a new swimsuit for the occasion. For some reason, Rio feels the urge to blush and look away, as she nods shyly. She grabs the sunscreen off of the dresser and heads for the door, knowing that Agatha is trailing closely behind her.</p><p>They stop at the hallway closet and grab a few towels to take with them to the beach. They also stop by the now empty kitchen, grabbing the drinks Jen had left for them on the counter.</p><p>They head out the back door soundlessly, making their way to where they can see and hear their friends set up.</p><p>Alice and Jen share a big beach chair, while Wanda is pressed up against Natasha’s side, laying on her stomach with her bikini top untied to avoid tan lines.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know how she did not see it before but these two are definitely fucking, and they are not doing anything to hide it from Agatha. She feels her counterpart fall still beside her, as she too comes to the same conclusions about the redheads. Rio feels a surge of protectiveness, grabbing Agatha’s hand and leading her to the other side of Jen and Alice’s chair, where a few more of Jen’s friends have settled in.</p><p>Rio wordlessly takes the towels out of Agatha’s hands and lays them down side by side. She sits down and reaches her hand out to help Agatha sit next to her, hoping she will let her take the lead this time. Let Rio take care of her just this once.</p><p>There is a twist of emotions on Agatha’s face as she looks down at Rio’s hand. Within a second they are all gone, replaced by a small shy smile as she gingerly places her hand in Rio’s and sits down by her side.</p><p>All the ladies are laying out in the sun now, drinking, listening to music, and enjoying each others company as the day moves slowly around them.</p><p>Wanda and Natasha are all over each other, whispering in ears, wandering hands, sneaking kisses.</p><p>Except it is not sneaky at all. Agatha is watching them like a hawk with a cold look in her eyes and Rio feels helpless to stop the pain she knows Agatha is feeling.</p><p>It is then Rio tries to distract her. If she can’t stand up and punch Wanda in the face, the next best thing she can do is take Agatha’s mind off of the softcore porn happening five feet away from them.</p><p>She taps Agatha’s shoulder and lifts up the sunscreen when Agatha turns to look at her. Agatha gives her a quick nod, a whispered <em>thanks</em>, and gathers her hair in her hands, moving it all to one shoulder in order to give Rio better access.</p><p>Three drinks in and Rio might not have thought this through.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and squirts sunscreen onto her hands. She hovers over Agatha’s shoulders for a moment before slowly lowering her hands. The second she makes contact both of their breaths hitch. Agatha’s because Rio assumes the sunblock is cold, and Rio’s because Agatha has the softest skin she has ever felt.</p><p>Of course they have touched each other countless times before, on accident and on purpose, but this? Purposefully running her hands all over Agatha’s back, massaging her shoulders.. Rio could get lost in the feeling of it.. In the little noises Agatha is making.. How pliant she is under her strong hands…</p><p>Rio didn’t even realize she was holding her breath until Agatha glanced over shoulder at her. It is at this moment that she also notices that the white of the sunscreen is completely gone. How long had she just been rubbing her shoulders?</p><p>The glint in Agatha’s eye is mischievous as she lays down on her stomach and picks the bottle of sunscreen back up off the towel.</p><p>“Do you think you could do the back of my legs too? You know I burn so easily.” Agatha pouts.</p><p>Rio feels it immediately. Her face must be glowing red at this point, and definitely not from the sun or the alcohol.</p><p>She clears her throat and nods, as she knows better than to trust her voice right now. She grabs the bottle and quickly looks around at the group as she squirts more cream into her hands.</p><p>It is only then that she notices.</p><p>The once carefree look on Wanda’s face has vanished.</p><p>Rio, in turn, has now come to two conclusions:</p><ol>
<li>Wanda has noticed what the two of them are doing and does not like what she sees.</li>
<li>Agatha is very much aware of conclusion one.</li>
</ol><p>Rio gulps and tries to shake off the fact that she has been caught in the middle of their game. Her hands, now covered in sunscreen, make their way down to the back of Agatha’s legs. The moment her touch lands, Agatha makes a noise between a yelp and a moan, arching her back into Rio’s touch. Rio can feel herself growing even more red, which she did not think was possible, as she starts rubbing her hands back and forth.</p><p>Logically, Rio knows that Agatha is playing it up to piss Wanda off. That does not stop the coil in Rio’s stomach from winding even tighter, as Agatha continues to let whimpers and moans slip louder and louder.</p><p>By the time everything is rubbed in, Wanda is sitting back up with her bikini tied back into place looking murderous, Agatha is still laying down with a shit eating grin on her face, and Rio? Well Rio needs to jump in the ocean before someone notices the wet spot in her swim trunks.</p><p>—</p><p>As the sun falls further down in the sky, everyone starts gathering their belongings and heading inside.</p><p>By the time Rio makes it back to their room, Agatha is still in the shower. Not wanting to scare her, Rio moves quietly throughout the space, gathering the outfit she is going to wear to dinner and the club tonight, the next two events on the weekend's itinerary.</p><p>Lost in her thoughts, Rio becomes slightly unaware of her surroundings. It is not until she hears a gasp that she whips around and spots Agatha, dripping wet from her shower, wrapped only in a small towel.</p><p>Before she can help herself, her eyes follow the drop of water that is running from Agatha’s neck, to her collarbone, to finally down her cleavage. It is when Rio becomes aware that she is staring that she whips her head around so fast that she hears her neck give out a pathetic crack.</p><p>She hears Agatha’s iconic witch cackle laugh, and once again feels heat encompass her body. Despite the fact that she is now turned away from Agatha, she closes her eyes, and puts her head in her hands, trying to respect Agatha’s privacy while simultaneously hiding how immediately affected she was by seeing her friend wet and half naked.</p><p>She is not going to survive this weekend.</p><p>Once Agatha catches her breath, she calls to Rio “ I am so sorry hun, I didn’t think you were back yet.”. While she does genuinely sound apologetic, it is clear she is still trying to hide the giggles that will not stop coming because of Rio embarrassing herself.</p><p>“Anyway, it’s all yours.” Agatha says with a smile, gesturing to the bathroom door where steam is still actively pouring out of the frame from Agatha’s shower.</p><p>Rio grabs her clothes, one hand still covering her face, and quickly feels her way into the bathroom. Once Rio shuts the door, she finally reopens her eyes. Immediately, her gaze falls to the clothes Agatha left behind, or more accurately, the pieces of scrap fabric that were being passed off as a bikini. Rio groans at the memory of her hands on Agatha’s sun kissed skin, her mind replaying the whimpers and moans Agatha let out as she touched her. How closely Wanda was watching them. The way Agatha’s body chased Rio’s hands, reacting to her touch. Rio knows that her swim trunks are officially ruined as she peels them down her legs while a small string of her own slick stays attached to her core.</p><p>There is nothing left to do for Rio but hop in the shower and hope Agatha’s games don’t leave her dehydrated by the end of the weekend.</p><p>—</p><p>Once her shower is done, Rio makes sure to get dressed before leaving the bathroom, not wanting another repeat of earlier. Her outfit is simple, just shorts and a nice button up, which she has left half open to show off her gold chain and black tank top.</p><p>She opens the door, letting out a puff of steam with her. Her eyes immediately fall to Agatha, who is sprawled across the bed watching tiktoks. Her hair is air drying, spread out across the bed. Her cheeks are slightly red from the sun, and her makeup is minimal but effective in making her eyes look enticing. All of that is enough to send Rio into a spiral as it is but what really does it is the outfit.</p><p>Agatha’s body is barely covered by a short lavender dress. The top of the dress clings to her chest, accentuating her cleavage beautifully. The bottom of the dress barely reaches down to mid thigh, but the way Agatha is laying right now makes the dress ride up higher. Rio is pretty sure if she were 3 steps to the left she would be able to see Agatha’s thong. Wait, why does Rio think she is wearing a thong? She could be wearing something lacey.. A matching set perhaps? Though now that Rio is really looking, Agatha is definitely not wearing a bra.. So not a matching set then–</p><p>“ Earth to Rio??” Agatha calls, startling Rio out of her thoughts.</p><p>For probably the tenth time today, Rio’s face feels hot and she is embarrassed. How long did she spend staring at Agatha wondering what her underwear looked like? Why is she being extra pathetic this weekend?</p><p>“Rio, did you hear me? I said I want to talk to you.” Agatha reminds Rio of the words she never heard.</p><p>“Yeah, uh sure.. What’s up?”. This is the moment. This is the moment Agatha is going to call Rio out for how awkward she has been all day. She is going to call her out for staring and touching and –</p><p>Agatha brings Rio’s thoughts to a halt, as she slowly stands and walks her way over to Rio.</p><p>“ So… This might sound weird… and you can totally say no if you want!” Agatha starts.</p><p>Okay.. so she doesn’t sound mad at Rio.</p><p>“ I was wondering– again only if you’re comfortable…”</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s struggle, and in that moment, all Rio can care about is making Agatha feel comfortable enough to get it out. Without thinking, she grabs Agatha’s hand and gives it a squeeze.</p><p>This makes Agatha’s eyes go wide as it all tumbles out.</p><p>“Well I was just thinking, at the beach today with the sunscreen and everything, I uh liked making Wanda jealous.”.</p><p>Rio gives her a look, wordlessly urging her to get to the point.</p><p>“It’s not that I want her back. Nora can have her for all I care. But if I have to be stuck here with the two of them all weekend, I should at least get to have my fun too right?”</p><p>Rio stares at her blankly, unsure of what Agatha is trying to say. She raises an eyebrow, signaling that she needs just a little bit more explanation.</p><p>Agatha huffs, rolls her eyes, and continues.</p><p>“What I am trying to say is that, if you’re comfortable with it, I think it would be really fun if we spent all weekend making Wanda jealous together.. Like how we did today at the beach?”.</p><p>Rio takes a moment… <em>and another moment</em>…</p><p>Suddenly she becomes hyper aware that her hand is still in Agatha’s, how close they are standing together.</p><p>“ You want.. To pretend like we are into each other?” Rio questions, wanting to make sure that she is definitely understanding this completely.</p><p>Agatha flushes at Rio’s directness and looks away, but verbally, she holds her ground.</p><p>“I mean yeah if you’re cool with it. I can always go ask one of Jen’s other friends that are here but I think it would be more fun with you anyway.” she explains. “Plus it would be an extra punch to the gut because Wanda was always so jealous of you when we were dating.” Agatha follows.</p><p>Now it is Rio’s turn to flush.</p><p>“ Wait, what? Why would she be jealous of me??” Rio questions, overwhelmed by all of the information she is taking in.</p><p>“ I don’t know Rio. Are you in or not?”. Agatha shoots back rolling her eyes, definitely not feeling shy anymore.</p><p>Is this a good idea for Rio? No, definitely not. Could this possibly end well for Rio? Not likely. Is Rio going to survive the next three days with Agatha pretending to be into her?</p><p>“Yeah okay, that sounds fun.” Rio manages to get out.</p><p>Make sure they write something cool on Rio’s headstone because she is so fucked.</p>

    <p>Chapter Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The ladies get dinner and then head to the club.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The car ride to the restaurant is quiet. Rio hops in Agatha’s car, purposefully staring out the window while Agatha hums along to her playlist like nothing happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They are the last to arrive at the restaurant, leaving them to fill the last two seats available, which just happen to be side by side. Rio sits with Wanda to her left, Agatha to her right, and Jen to Agatha’s right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s a cozy seaside spot, with an outdoor patio and killer seafood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As dinner goes on, Rio almost entirely forgets about their arrangement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That is until Agatha’s seafood alfredo arrives and she moans at the first bite. Gathering a mouthful on her fork, she brings it up to Rio’s lips and whispers “Try this <em>baby</em>, it tastes so good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio and Wanda’s eyes go wide at the same time. Jen just laughs it off, already knowing Agatha’s games. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio obediently opens her mouth, letting Agatha feed her from her fork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second the food hits her tongue, Rio closes her eyes and lets out a soft moan. She’s not sure if the food really is just that good, or if everything tastes better when it's fed to her by Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Opening her eyes back up, Rio looks at Agatha’s face as it morphs from surprised to satisfied at Rio’s behavior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha then brings her hand up to Rio’s face, using her thumb to clean up a drop of sauce that landed on the corner of her bottom lip. Rio has to resist the urge to part her lips on reflex. Agatha then sticks that same thumb into her mouth, giving it a light suck to clean it up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All better.”, She winks at Rio and returns to her food.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio is no longer hungry for her shrimp tacos. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On top of the heat in her own gut, Rio doesn’t even have to look to feel the waves of anger coming off of Wanda to her left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is around dessert when Rio finally feels calm enough to play along. She leans into Agatha offering her a spoon of her chocolate cheesecake. A devilish smirk crosses Agatha’s face as she places her hands on Rio’s thigh, looking up at her with big doe eyes, opening her mouth wide for Rio to place the bite in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s stomach drops and she gulps, watching her friend’s mouth close, humming around the spoon in her mouth. Before she realizes what she is doing, she has already picked up more of the dessert, subconsciously wanting to experience </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Want another one?”, Rio whispers, to which Agatha innocently nods her head, as if she doesn’t know how pretty she looks when she is being fed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gets lost in the feeling of giving Agatha bite after bite, enjoying the performative noises she is making. At some point Rio accidentally misses her mouth, getting the chocolate on the tip of Agatha’s nose. They both start giggling like it's an inside joke, and Rio quickly wipes it with her napkin, while Agatha scrunches her nose playfully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s only when Rio hears a huff behind her that she remembers that they have an audience.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Turning to Wanda, who looks as if she is seething over their little display, Rio feels guilt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She quickly drops her spoon on the plate and stands up, announcing that she is going to the bathroom. She walks across the restaurant mentally chastising herself for forgetting their agreement. The whole point was that this was to piss Wanda off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was never real. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio busted into the empty single stall bathroom, locking the door behind her and splashing water in her face. She needed to calm down before heading back out there, worried that everyone would recognize how worked up she was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she turned off the sink, Rio heard a soft knock on the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fuck. Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio finishes drying off her face and takes one last breath before opening up the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pushes past her and locks the door back up behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was amazing! Feeding each other food is a classic for a reason! Did you see the look on her– hey wait Rio are you okay?” Agatha pauses when she sees the look in Rio’s eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-yeah I’m fine. I just needed a moment.”, Rio stammers out, trying to pull herself together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha takes another step closer, “ If you want to stop, we can..”. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No!”, Rio snaps back, a little too fast and a little too loud. Wincing at the sound of her own voice, she continues, “I mean, no. That’s not it. I swear I just needed a second. I am fully onboard.”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha takes a moment, really scanning Rio’s face. She must find what she is looking for, because suddenly the moment is gone and Agatha is back to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay so on my way over here, I actually had another idea..”, she says with a sly grin on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Again! You can totally say no if you are uncomfortable but… would it be okay if you gave me a hickey? Somewhere visible to make sure she can’t ignore it? Maybe rough each other's hair up a bit? She is so close to snapping, I can feel it, and what lesbians can resist a bathroom makeout session anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio just stares at her, the image of pressing Agatha up against the wall and licking into her mouth while she was wearing that short purple dress was too tempting to dismiss. But still, Rio has to bring up the obvious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do know it’s not just Wanda out there right? If we do this, Alice and Jen might also get the wrong idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha just shrugs, “Let’em. It’ll make it way more convincing if everyone else thinks we are fooling around too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, Rio can’t argue with that logic. And who is she to look a gift horse in the mouth?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright”, she says walking over to the nearest wall. “Come here.”, her voice sounding steadier than what she felt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha freezes for a split second, as if not expecting Rio to agree so easily. In a blink, her hesitation is gone, replaced by that irritatingly familiar smirk as she glides her way to Rio. Leaning her head back against the wall, her pupils dilate slightly, “ Where do you want me handsome?”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just like that..”, Rio breathes as she places her hands on the wall besides Agatha’s head, bracketing her in. She dips her head down slowly, hovering her mouth over Agatha’s neck as she takes a second to absorb her scent. Absorb every part of this moment really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As lavender and mint invade her senses, Rio’s mouth finally makes contact with Agatha’s skin, leaving the smallest brush of her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're going to have to try a little harder than that if you want to leave a mark.”, Agatha whispers faux seductively, the sound right in Rio’s ear. Despite knowing it’s a joke, Rio flushes a little anyway, still battling with the remnants of their earlier performance at the dinner table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not wanting to draw out her own torture any longer, Rio opens her mouth and plants a bolder kiss on Agatha’s neck. Then another. Then another. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finally chooses a spot right above Agatha’s collarbone to latch onto, sucking what is sure to become a nasty bruise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The moment her teeth start nibbling, Agatha’s breath hitches and her hands shoot into Rio’s hair, holding her head against her, pulling her closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Feeling spurred on by Agatha’s reaction, Rio takes it further, picking a new spot to bite down on just below her ear. Agatha whimpers, the sound drawing Rio’s own hips forward until they are genuinely fully pressed against each other. Rio moves onto another spot, and they are both subtly rocking against each other now, the sound of panting filling the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio, lost in the moment, starts moving her leg on muscle memory alone, about to pull out one of the most effective tools in the lesbian arsenal, the </span>
  <b>
    <em>knee move</em>
  </b>
  <span>. By this point, her hands have found their way to Agatha’s hips, trying to hold her still against the wall. Agatha does not seem to mind, fingers lightly scratching at Rio’s scalp, head fully thrown back against the wall. With Rio’s knee inches away from Agatha’s core, there is a sudden pounding on the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha? Rio? Are you guys in there?”, comes a familiar voice on the other side. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wanda.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately, Rio jumps back, somehow gaining three feet of distance in one swift move. Agatha closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. “Just a minute..”, she calls back with a voice two octaves higher than usual. Rio tries to suppress a grin, pleased to know that she too is affecting Agatha, even if just a little. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opens her eyes back up and looks at herself in the mirror. She pulls the hem of her dress back down and pats her hair where the wall mussed it up. She then gingerly brings her fingers up to her neck, ghosting over the four separate purple marks that were beginning to form on her neck. “We aren’t trying to make Count Dracula jealous, Rio. Jesus Christ.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio, who was still slightly out of breath and dazed in the middle of the room, looked up at Agatha’s words, unable to process any of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh… what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back at Rio then, taking in her affected state. She slowly made her way over to Rio, letting out a sharp giggle, with something mean hidden in the sound of her voice. “My God, who knew you would be so eager to please, pet?”, she teases, bringing her hand up to stroke Rio’s head like a dog.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of making Rio feel ashamed, like she</span>
  <em>
    <span> should </span>
  </em>
  <span>have felt, the harsh tone of Agatha’s words just turned her on more. She had to fight the urge to press her thighs together, looking for any relief from the situation she put herself in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knock comes again, this time louder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Agatha. Other people need to use the bathroom too.”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha spends one more second looking at Rio before souring her face and rolling her eyes. Tossing her hair over her shoulder to show off her neck, she stalks towards the door and swings it open, “ All yours, dear”, she smiles sickeningly sweet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushes past the redhead, returning to the restaurant hallway. She stops mid stride and shoots a look over her shoulder at Rio, “Come on, </span>
  <em>
    <span>pretty girl</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”, she almost purrs, giving one subtle tilt of her head towards the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the pet name, Rio feels a phantom tug on her metaphorical leash, beckoning her to follow Agatha’s command. Her feet start moving before her brain can even fully process Agatha’s words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Back at the table, the check has already been divided and paid. Upon seeing the state of the two of them, Jen and Alice exchange a look with each other, and then with their two friends. One that says </span>
  <em>
    <span>We are so talking about this later.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio and Agatha think that is fair enough, thankful that they don’t have to explain themselves in front of the entire restaurant. Everyone grabs their things and heads back out to the parking lot, going home to drop off their leftovers and cars, in order to walk to the nearest gay club, which is about five minutes down the street from their rental house.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They all take two shots to pregame, one in honor of each bride, and then they set out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Upon entering the establishment, Rio immediately heads to the bar, knowing that she is going to need more than two shots to make it through the rest of this night without combusting. Agatha sidles up alongside her and whispers over her shoulder, “Not gonna buy a lady a drink first?”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio glances over at the goofy grin on Agatha’s face, proud of her own stupid joke, and she can’t help but smile too. Rio thinks Agatha’s smile could light up any room, even the darkest bar corner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She orders Agatha’s go-to drink for nights like this, vodka Red Bull, and puts it all on her card.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shoots Agatha a wink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No one can say I’m not a gentleman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bartender hands Agatha her drink, as she forms a devilish smirk, “Typically, a gentleman buys the drink before sucking on the lady's neck in the bathroom but I’ll allow it..”, she pointedly jokes as she brings the straw to her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio can do nothing but giggle, sipping on her own drink to hide the blush growing on her face at the reminder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They spend a little while in this more quiet corner of the club, far enough away from any speakers that they can actually hear each other speak. They each get a few more drinks, passing the time catching up and laughing about old stories. That is until about 3 drinks each in when Alice spots them from where she is letting loose on the dance floor. They both know they are done for the second they lock eyes with her, as a very tipsy Alice starts barreling her way over to the couple, determined to make sure they feel included in the festivities.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come dance with us! It’s my bachelorette party, you have to!", Alice all but whines, yelling to the duo over the loud music.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both exchange a look with each other, knowing at this point in the night it is just easier to give in to Alice’s demands, grateful they got by for so long flying under the radar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stands first, holding her hand out for Agatha to take, a new habit that seems to have already solidified between the two. Agatha happily takes it and allows Rio to lead her onto the dance floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the alcohol flowing through their veins and the loudspeakers playing trashy pop music, the vibes are just right. The flashing multicolored lights illuminate Agatha’s features every four beats, making Rio feel like she is falling prey to the sounds of a siren hidden amongst jagged rocks. She steers her ship forward anyway, unable to resist the call as she grabs Agatha’s hand pulling their bodies slightly closer together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looks down at the spot that Rio has joined them, and then back up at her, something unreadable in her eyes. The marks Rio left on Agatha are more prominent now, having been given time to fully bruise. She looks beautiful and Rio can’t stop staring, getting small flashbacks to that cramped bathroom at the restaurant. The way Agatha pulled her closer, the way her back arched while her head tilted further back inviting Rio to leave no spot untouched. Without thinking, Rio finds herself stepping even closer to Agatha, her free hand moving to Agatha’s hip, drawing them even tighter together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their eyes finally meet, the noise of the club has almost faded completely. It feels like they are the only two people in the world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then Agatha pauses, looking past Rio’s shoulder for a brief second, eyebrows furrowing almost immediately. Rio turns her head, following Agatha’s gaze, landing on the site of Wanda and Natasha grinding into each other like their lives depend on it. Almost as if she can feel their eyes, Wanda’s head turns, looking directly at Agatha with a smug look on her face as Natasha grips Wanda by the hips, pulling her back flush against her front. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio hears Agatha growl, a second before she lunges for Rio, grabbing her by the back of the neck and pulling her in. She takes the hand she was just holding and guides it to her other hip, lower this time, just brushing over the top of her ass. She squeezes over Rio’s hand, encouraging her to form her own solid grip on her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Make it look like you can’t keep your hands off of me”, Agatha spits like venom into Rio’s ear, unaware of how deeply her words hit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately Rio’s grip tightens as she grabs at Agatha’s waist. Unable to hold still, her hands begin exploring, running over her shoulders, playing with the ends of her hair, running the back of her knuckles over Agatha’s neck. Rio is everywhere except Agatha’s breasts and ass, not wanting to overstep any lines. Maybe this friendship could still be salvable?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is as that thought crosses her mind that Rio suddenly feels a breath on her neck. Fuck. She tries to turn her head but Agatha has burrowed herself into Rio’s shoulder, lips hovering just above Rio’s skin as they grind into each other to the music.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am going to return the favor now. Nod if that is okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unsure of what Agatha is talking about, as her brain is essentially just a chalkboard with the word </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha </span>
  </em>
  <span>written on it right now, Rio nods dumbly. Not even taking a single second to consider what Agatha was asking permission for. It is not until Rio feels Agatha’s tongue on her neck, does she realize exactly what Agatha means. She feels the younger girl's mouth begin to nibble and suck right over her pulse point, causing her entire body to feel as though she had just been struck by lightning, the sensation shooting immediately down to her clit as she bites her tongue to keep the moan from pouring out of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth is soft and warm, causing goosebumps to break out over the entirety of Rio’s body. She does not think this is a feeling she could ever get used to. Agatha changes angles now, going for a different spot closer to where Rio’s neck meets her shoulder. This time, she bites down a little harder, coaxing out a pathetically turned on yelp from Rio. At the sound and the feeling of Rio’s body tensing in her arms, Agatha must be encouraged. Devouring every available inch of Rio’s skin, moving to sucking on her jaw once she is satisfied with her neck and upper chest. Rio's skin feels as if it is buzzing with adrenaline, her body begging her to throw Agatha over her shoulder, to carry her out of this club to a place only Rio gets to see her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of that amazing plan, all Rio can do is whimper and fall apart in Agatha’s arms. She can’t even pretend she is not ridiculously turned on, fighting off every urge she has to embarrass herself by finishing untouched in her pants, as Agatha continues to tease her teeth across Rio's skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After what feels like an eternity, Agatha finally pulls back and gets an eyeful of her hard work. Rio cannot see herself, but by the proud look in Agatha’s eye, she is already regretting not bringing a turtle neck down the Cape in the middle of June. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She honestly can’t even bring herself to care at this point, as being claimed by Agatha Harkness in front of all of these people in the middle of a dance floor is probably one of the hottest things that has ever happened to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha may end up killing her, but at least she will die a happy woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After what feels like hours, the ladies finally head home. All too drunk and exhausted to say anything other than goodnight to each other, everyone retreats to their separate bedrooms, Rio following Agatha up to theirs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the door finally shuts behind them, Agatha immediately falls backwards onto the bed, having drunk enough to knock out a full grown horse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite having kept up with Agatha, Rio knows she will want her makeup off, having spent many nights in college recovering from the club together. Rio grabs a small towel from their bathroom and wets it with soap and water. She kneels on the side of the bed and takes Agatha’s face in her hands, and starts rubbing the cloth over her skin as gently as possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes are closed but a small smile forms on her face at the feeling of Rio’s touch, head leaning into her hands, silently asking for more. Rio’s heart clenches at the sight of Agatha so soft. A part of her wishes that she could do this for her every night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she finishes and is about to pull away to stand back up, Agatha’s hand shoots out, grabbing onto her wrist. Her eyes remain closed but she whispers, “ Rio… I—“.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pauses, not moving a muscle, afraid she will scare Agatha off from finishing her thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finally cracks her eyes open, giving Rio a very serious look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you… for today.. I really did have a good time with you.”, she says as a shy smile graces her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio realizes they are just inches apart now, as her body feels pulled to Agatha’s like a magnet. Her eyes drift down to Agatha’s mouth, the urge to close the distance between them feels all encompassing. Agatha seems to have similar thoughts as her eyes also drift down to her best friend’s mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without moving her gaze, Agatha whispers, “ Do you think you could… get me some water…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffs out a tiny laugh, bringing her eyes back up to Agatha’s. She leans in, giving her the softest peck on her forehead right before bringing herself back up to her feet with a small nod.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she is walking down the stairs to the kitchen, Rio chooses to remind herself that she needs Agatha in her life. Confessing her feelings isn’t worth losing her best friend over. She will enjoy the weekend, living in a pretend world where Agatha Harkness somehow wants her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This is enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This will have to be enough.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Light streams in through the cracks in the curtain.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing Rio feels is hair. Soft, long hair. Everywhere. </p><p> </p><p>She tries opening her eyes, only to be met by a curtain of thick lavender and mint scented locks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Becoming more aware, Rio realizes three things at once: </p><p> </p><ol>
<li>Agatha’s hair is draped over the entire upper half of Rio's body. </li>
<li>Agatha has her arm wrapped tightly around Rio's waist, holding onto her as if someone was going to drag her away at any moment.</li>
<li>Rio is very hungover. </li>
</ol><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio brings her left arm up to her face, carefully freeing herself from the wonderfully soft prison that Agatha’s hair had created. </p><p> </p><p>Next, she assesses. Looking down, she sees that Agatha had gravitated towards her while they slept. It seems that she is now treating Rio’s body as if it was a giant stuffed animal. Her leg is thrown over Rio’s waist, her face is pressed into the side of Rio’s neck. Rio takes a deep breath as she has now become aware of the fact that Agatha’s sleep shirt has ridden up, showing off her tummy that softly rises as she takes deep, sleepy breaths. Warm air leaves Agatha’s nose, tickling Rio’s neck and sending chills down the entire right hand side of her body. </p><p> </p><p>Rio instinctually holds her breath as she feels her heart drop into her stomach as the full reality dawns on her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is <em>cuddling</em> her. </p><p> </p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p> </p><p>The tensing of her body must have been obvious, as she feels Agatha begin to stir on top of her. </p><p> </p><p>Not knowing what the right thing to do is, Rio closes her eyes again and tries to even out her breathing. Pretending to be asleep when Agatha realizes where she is might save Rio from the sting of rejection when she inevitably pulls herself away in disgust. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s head finally lifts from Rio’s chest, she can’t see the reaction on her face. Rio fights her instincts that beg her to peek during what feels like the longest 10 seconds of  her life. </p><p> </p><p>Finally something happens. Agatha lets out a soft chuckle and then lets her head fall back down onto Rio, nuzzling right back into her original spot. Warmth immediately blossoms throughout Rio’s body. A tear of pure bliss threatens to fall from Rio’s eye as she sleepily adjusts herself closer to Agatha in return, playing it off as an unconscious movement. Rio does not care what time it is or the reason behind this small gift from God, but she is not about to start asking any questions. </p><p> </p><p>The soft skin of Agatha’s thigh rubs along Rio’s leg as she feels the younger woman start falling back asleep. Agatha’s hand flexes against Rio’s chest, subtly gripping the collar of Rio’s sleepshirt. They are completely tangled together in soft sheets and warm morning sunlight. </p><p> </p><p>Rio never wants to move again.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>She must have drifted back to sleep at some point because she is suddenly startled awake. There is a loud noise coming from somewhere beyond the bedroom door that jolts Rio into an upright position. The bed beside her is cold and empty, and Rio’s heart cracks a little in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>Looking around she concludes that Agatha must have gotten up and headed downstairs at some point, as Rio is fully alone in the space. Walking over to the bathroom mirror, she jumps at her own reflection. Her neck is littered in tiny delicate bruises shaped like Agatha’s mouth. She grabs the top of her sleep shirt, pulling it down to reveal even more discolored marks. Something hot starts pooling in between her legs as flashes of the dance floor come flooding back to her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands exploring Agatha’s curves in that dress, Agatha’s mouth trailing over every inch of skin Rio had to offer. The way she encouraged Rio’s hands to grip her, the way their sweaty bodies pressed together in the sea of people, Agatha’s mouth claiming her in in front of everyone… </p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her face flush in real time as she tried to ignore the thought of what Agatha’s mouth would feel like against her own. What she would taste like, the noises she would make as Rio’s hand made its way down to the hem of her dress— </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Woah there. </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head as if she can physically rid herself of the images that her brain is concocting. A few neck kisses and she is suddenly imagining Agatha clawing at her back as Rio— and Jesus Christ it isn’t even noon yet. Rio splashes water in her face because even her self-reprimands are sounding horny. </p><p> </p><p>She goes through her morning routine, and gets dressed, putting a little extra makeup on her neck to hide some of the bruising. </p><p> </p><p>Just as she is finishing up Agatha busts through the door. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s about time you woke up. I thought I was going to have to start banging pots and pans.”, she snorts. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes take Rio in, slowly working her way up Rio’s body until finally landing on her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Did I say you could cover those up? What’s the point of all the hard work I put into them if you’re not even going to show them off”, she huffs, rolling her eyes as she makes her way towards Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She stops right in front of her and looks at Rio expectantly, waiting for an explanation. </p><p> </p><p>It’s in this moment that Rio takes the opportunity to take Agatha in. Her hair is up in a messy bun, putting her neck and Rio’s marks on full display. Rio burns at the reminder of their time in the bathroom. Making her way further down, she sees that Agatha is wearing a different bikini under one of the button down shirts Rio packed for herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that my shirt?”, Rio manages to get out, instead of explaining herself, as the image of Agatha in her clothing twists something deep in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks down as if she forgot what she was wearing. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, do you like it?”, she says, jokingly clasping her hands behind her back as if she was feeling shy.</p><p> </p><p>“Figured it would be a nice touch, but if you need it back I can take it off–”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”, Rio says almost too loudly, cutting Agatha’s sentence off. She really needs to stop doing that. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit, I mean it’s fine. It looks better on you anyway.”, Rio swiftly adds in, trying to avoid embarrassing herself any further.</p><p> </p><p>For a split second, Rio thinks she sees the tips of Agatha’s ears start to go red, but her vision is blocked instantly as Agatha quickly turns herself around and yells out behind her, “ Everything looks better on me darling. Now take that makeup off and meet us outside. Everyone else has been up for at least an hour.”</p><p> </p><p>What else is there to do? Rio grabs the hand towel from last night and rubs the makeup off of her skin. It wasn’t doing much anyway.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p><br />
After grabbing some toast and a glass of water to settle her stomach, Rio joins the ladies outside. She starts listening in as she makes her way over, hearing Jen go over the itinerary for the day, which Rio notes is beach, exploring downtown, and then a girl’s night in.</p><p> </p><p>As she gets closer, heads start turning towards her. Alice pipes up first, with a very smug look on her face, “ Well, well, if it isn’t Nosferatu herself. First, you suck on Agatha’s neck, then you sleep half the day away. Is there something you wanna tell us, Rio Vidal?”.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts out loud at that, while Wanda rolls her eyes. Rio just clears her throat as she sits herself down on the side of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Well good morning to you too, Alice Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shakes her head at the retort, getting up and planting herself on Rio’s other side.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, you are not getting off that easy. Spill.”, she says, her volume lower than it was before.</p><p> </p><p>She looks back at Agatha who widens her eyes and shrugs her shoulders. Apparently Rio is not the only one who forgot this moment was coming.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re referring to Alice.”, Rio tries acting clueless, unable to think of something better with her raging hangover. Her brain still felt a little mushy.</p><p> </p><p>This was definitely the wrong call.</p><p> </p><p>“Well whatever happened, it’s about time. It’s clear you two have been into each other forever. I am just glad you are finally doing something about it! ‘Girl’s nights’ were starting to feel like the backstory to a WWE match. All of that underlying, homoerotic sexual tension…”, Alice jokes, not realizing her mistake.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is mortified, unable to pick her jaw up off of the floor after being called out so viciously. Has she been that obvious all of this time? Has she liked Agatha so much that her crush has created an entirely one-sided sexual tension? Sure, Agatha is flirty but she is like that with everyone! The girl could have chemistry with a rock.</p><p> </p><p>Rio realizes she should probably correct Alice, or at the very least form words to respond with, but she is beaten to the punch. </p><p> </p><p>“Definitely took us long enough, right sweetheart? I swear a girl can only drop so many hints.”, Agatha jokes, dropping a quick kiss on Rio’s shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is so confused. What the fuck is happening?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to the water.”, Rio states as she stands back up. She reaches for the hem of her t-shirt and pulls it up over her head, tossing it onto the towel beside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She looks back down at Agatha, who looks as if she may have seen a ghost.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming too!” her counterpart squeaks, swiftly scrambling to her feet, taking Rio’s shirt off and folding it onto the towel. </p><p> </p><p>As if it is muscle memory, Rio’s arm starts to naturally reach out towards Agatha, wanting to offer her hand in case the other girl needs help getting her footing on the sand. Rio notices that, without even looking at her, Agatha’s hand also begins lifting towards Rio’s, almost as if she expects it to be there. </p><p> </p><p>Despite her state of confusion, Rio’s heart clenches when their palms meet in the middle. Agatha looks up at her dumbstruck expression, seemingly not recognizing how in sync they just were. Rio can’t fight the smile that breaks across her face either way as they head down to the water together hand in hand.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, do not fucking play with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, stop being a baby and get in the water.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am warning you right now, Rio. Today is not the day and I am not the one. This fish toilet is fucking cold.”, she states, narrowing her eyes and crossing her arms tightly over her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face slowly turns into a devilish grin as she jumps up out of the water and grabs Agatha by the waist, lifting her into the air with little to no effort.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha screams, automatically wrapping her legs and arms around Rio’s torso, as if Rio was her savior instead of her attacker.</p><p> </p><p>“ Rio. Please think this through. Put me down right now and we both walk away with all of our limbs.” Agatha threatens, trying to hide the slight panic in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Her nails are digging into Rio’s bicep deliciously as she begs to be saved from her fate. The further in Rio walks, the tighter Agatha’s legs get around her waist, her core pressing directly against Rio’s lower abs. There is genuinely nowhere else she would rather be. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s not even sure if Wanda can see them from this far away, but maybe Agatha is playing it on the safe side.</p>

  <p>After everyone comes back from the beach, they all shower and get dressed in their going out clothes. Rio dons a green, cropped collared shirt, matching it with some cargo shorts, silver rings, and her platform converse. She lets her hair air dry around her shoulders, puts on hanging plant earrings, and finishes the outfit by attaching her keys to one of her belt loops via a carabiner.</p><p> </p><p>She could not look gayer if she tried, thank God.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally emerges from the bathroom, Rio’s mouth goes a little dry. </p><p> </p><p>She is wearing a short green sundress, covered in tiny white flowers. Her hair is in a messy ponytail, Rio’s marks very visible on her neck, and her ears are decked out in her signature golden piercings. </p><p> </p><p>“Ready to go?” Agatha asked absentmindedly as she grabbed her own converse, sitting on the bed to lace them up. </p><p> </p><p>It dawned on Rio then that they had accidentally matched their outfits. Her traitorous gay heart clenched tightly in her chest. It took every muscle in her body to stop her from immediately reaching for Agatha, her arms itching to bring the other girl as close to herself as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had her own moment of recognition when she finally looked up at Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God this is perfect. We have to take photos right now. Wanda will hate this, she always wanted to match with me.”</p><p> </p><p>A huge grin split her face as she grabbed her phone and then Rio’s hand, leading her to the large standing mirror in their room. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay now stand behind me and put your hands on my hips.”, Agatha instructed. She angled her body so that both of their outfits were visible in frame, but most of their faces were cut off.</p><p> </p><p>They took a few pictures like that, moving slightly to have different options. </p><p> </p><p>“Um… Maybe we could get a few with you kissing my cheek?”, her voice came out unsure, as if Rio could ever say no to her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly leaned her head over her shoulder, tucking loose strands of Agatha’s hair behind her ear so that the camera could catch the soft act of intimacy. She tightened her grip on Agatha’s waist with her other hand, hoping the action would help ground her as she felt butterflies fluttering in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>She ghosted her lips over the soft skin of the younger girl’s cheeks, letting the moment stretch between them. Agatha’s hand that was not holding the phone came up to the back of Rio’s head, landing in her hair. The light pressure encouraged Rio, pushing her closer into the heat of Agatha’s body as she fully pressed down, planting a gentle kiss on her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up at her as she pulled away slightly, their faces inches apart. Rio’s breath caught in her throat as her eyes flickered down to her glossy red painted lips, wanting nothing more than to feel them on her own. She heard the camera click one last time, as Agatha captured the moment and then looked back down at her phone. </p><p> </p><p>“These are perfect! Since when did we start looking so good together?”, Agatha jokes, already creating her post on instagram. </p><p> </p><p>Rio just hummed in agreement, knowing if she tried to speak her voice would come out a little rough.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait! One more thing!” Agatha exclaimed as she twisted herself in Rio’s arms, rose to her tippy toes, and leaned forward. For a moment, Rio’s entire body froze as the knot in her stomach pulled as tight as physically possible. At the last second, Agatha tilted her head and pressed a firm kiss just above Rio’s jaw, leaving a red lips stain behind. She raised her phone up between them, capturing the picture of the mark to add to the photo dump. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, now we are ready.” she said with a devilish grin, quickly wiping the mark off of Rio’s face and grabbing her tote bag on the way out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly brought her fingers up to the spot, sure that her ears were bright red after that display. She adjusted her hair further forward to hide the evidence, grabbed her own phone off the desk and jogged to catch up with her best friend.</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>After a bit of traveling as a group downtown, everyone ended up splitting into pairs, taking time to explore the streets and shop in the local tourist traps. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio found themselves in a quirky bookstore, the inside and outside decorated in pride flags. Rio began to wander towards the gifts section of the business, looking for a souvenir to add to her collection. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes widened as they fell upon a gorgeous keychain that had two tiny interlocked scissors attached to it. She giggled while reaching for the masterpiece, knowing she needed to have it the second she saw it. </p><p> </p><p>At the same time Rio’s hand came into contact with the item, another hand touched hers. She yelped slightly, startled by the unexpected contact. She pulled her hand back as she looked towards the other’s owner. It was a woman with long blonde hair, probably a little younger than Rio herself. The unnamed girl pulled her hand back as well, a dusting of pink appearing on her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry about that”, she said shyly, her eyes roving over Rio. “You would think I would have noticed a girl as handsome as you sooner…”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes a little at the compliment, surprised by the blonde’s boldness but not really interested.</p><p> </p><p>As she is about to open her mouth, informing the stranger not to worry about it, she is suddenly cut off. </p><p> </p><p>“There you are <em> babygirl. </em> I thought I lost you in this place.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha appeared out of nowhere, walking herself in between the two of them without sparing a second glance at the other girl. She wore an over exaggerated pout on her face that Rio had a very strong urge to kiss. How can someone be hot and adorable at the same time? It made Rio’s stomach feel a little sick. No one should be able to wield this kind of power without losing themselves to corruption, yet Agatha did it effortlessly.</p><p> </p><p>As if that wasn’t enough, Agatha solidified her point by bringing both of her hands up to cup Rio’s face. Pulling Rio towards her, she planted a light kiss on her cheek, re-marking her skin with red lipstick, and whispered in her ear, “ Did you find what you were looking for, <em> love </em>?”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio immediately felt her cheeks begin to heat against Agatha’s cold hands, barely processing anything she said past the ‘babygirl’ from earlier. Her hands gravitated towards Agatha’s waist as if it was second nature, instinctually pulling Agatha a little closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Um…”, Rio’s mouth sounded trying to form a reply but she came up empty handed. How was she supposed to think when Agatha’s face was right next to hers?</p><p> </p><p>Sensing Rio’s struggle, Agatha pulled away slightly, allowing her the view of the other girl’s back as she walked away from the two of them, clearly understanding the message Agatha just sent.</p><p> </p><p>“Guess I shouldn’t have wiped the first one off.”, Agatha scoffed to herself, clearly feeling more relaxed now that the blonde was gone.</p><p> </p><p>With a little distance between them, Rio’s mind began to clear up.</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you do that? Wanda’s not even here.”, she said like a stupid idiot, regretting it immediately when Agatha dropped her face taking a full two steps back from her.</p><p> </p><p>The soft pouty look on her face dropped instantly. Something in her eyes shifted as the corners of her mouth lifted into a cruel smile, one Rio does not think she has ever seen directed at her before.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t flirt with every girl in this fucking town Rio. The idea of me sharing you is just not believable.”, she shrugged nonchalantly, doing a poor job of hiding the venom in her tone. “You can keep it in your pants for one full weekend, can’t you?”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to open her mouth and point out that she was not flirting with anyone, but Agatha had already walked away, clearly not interested in Rio’s explanation.</p><p> </p><p>She felt angry but thrilled at the same time, adrenaline rushing under her skin. Agatha had no right to claim her like that and they both knew that was a weak excuse… On the other hand though, there was something really hot about the dangerous and possessive side of Agatha that caused a shameful pulse to start between her legs. </p><p> </p><p>Who does she think she is fooling anyway? At this point, Rio thinks it is clear to everyone that she already belongs to her.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The two of them end up meeting back up with everyone at the cars, stopping at the grocery store on the way back to grab supplies for dinner and more alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>By 7pm, the house’s kitchen has come to life. Sabrina Carpenter and Chapel Roan are blasting over the speakers as the girls laugh and dance, sipping wine in their pajamas. They are making personal pizzas for dinner, rolling out the dough and assembling with all of the ingredients they bought at the market. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is wearing one of the sleepshirts Rio brought, an old band t-shirt that she got in highschool, with a pair of Rio’s flannel boxer shorts, that she only wears to bed. Rio decides that she might as well start sharing her entire wardrobe with Agatha, as she loves seeing the younger girl in her clothes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is wearing a simple white wife pleaser with a pair of snoopy sleep shorts she packed. She is surprised Agatha went for the boxers instead of these but she is definitely not complaining.</p><p> </p><p>The house’s oven is definitely not big enough for everyone to go at once, so they have been cooking two pizzas at a time. Wanda and Natasha go first. Rio thinks that they actually make a cute couple, and that is definitely not because she wants Agatha all to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen go next, followed by two of Jen’s other friends that Rio has met in passing. Rio unfortunately does not remember the names of these girls and it is definitely too late to ask at this point.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha are the last ones to go, as Agatha claimed she needed at least one drink on an empty stomach to save money. While Alice scolded her, Agatha only drank her wine faster, already pouring a second glass. Rio giggles as she watches the display, endeared by Agatha’s stubborn, bratty heart. She wonders to herself if Agatha is like that in the bedro– nope.</p><p> </p><p>Caught that thought right on time. A shake of the head and it is gone. Rio has decided that she is going to be on her best behavior tonight. No reason to make this fake dating stuff harder than it has to be by thinking about if Agatha likes to be in charge or tamed into submission. If she would like to tie Rio up and ride her strap or if she would prefer to be tied down herself, maybe make use of a spreader bar? Rio thinks she would be happy to be a part of either fantasy. Rio then thinks that she is a degenerate who has already failed. </p><p> </p><p>Okay. Best behavior starting now.</p><p> </p><p>As Rio wraps up her own scolding, she is suddenly brought back to the present when she hears Alice call out that the kitchen is all theirs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio instinctually reaches out for Agatha’s hand, wanting to lead her to the kitchen and get started. Agatha looks down at it and scoffs, pushing past Rio and making her own way. There is a small chorus of ‘oofs’ from the ladies who watched the display. </p><p> </p><p>“Guess there’s trouble in paradise.” Wanda says smugly, taking a small sip of her wine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and follows after Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, the space is very much open concept, so while no one can hear them from this far away over the music, everyone can still see them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is already cutting the last big ball of dough in half, one for each of them to use as their crusts. Rio stops right on the side of her, noting Agatha purposefully avoiding her eye. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha? What’s wrong? Are you still mad about the bookstore?”, Rio half-whispers, still feeling a little hurt from the rejection.</p><p> </p><p>“No, I am not mad about the bookstore, Rio.” Agatha states dryly, rolling her eyes as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. She starts slapping her dough harshly while kneading it, treating it as if it was Rio’s face probably.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay… then what’s wrong? What happened?”, Rio pushes further, starting to feel a little desperate. Agatha is not typically the best at open communication but this feels different. Rio feels guilty and she doesn’t even know what she did.</p><p> </p><p>“Just forget it!”, she exclaims, delivering a particularly sharp slap to the ball to punctuate her point. </p><p> </p><p>If they were in a different situation, Rio’s mind would have definitely run somewhere dirty with the way Agatha’s hand spanked that, but now is definitely not the time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio decides that maybe backing off is the right call. Giving Agatha space might help her calm down, which will hopefully allow Rio to get the truth out of her.</p><p> </p><p>They work in awkward silence for a few minutes. Rio successfully rolled her crust out perfectly, already beginning to move onto the sauce. She had had a lot of experience with doughs as she essentially grew up in her mother’s kitchen, helping her make homemade arepas, quesitos, and empanadillas. Essentially whatever her Mami was feeling that week.</p><p> </p><p>Looking over at Agatha, however, it was clear she did not have the same background. Her pizza foundation was mangled by her angry hands. The harder she tried to fix it, the worse she made the situation, the dough somehow crumbling in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>Unable to resist, Rio slowly moved behind Agatha, giving her plenty of time to move away if she wanted to. She stayed put, allowing Rio to conduct her dough-saving intervention.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood directly behind her, looking over her left shoulder. She brought her arms around Agatha’s, picking up the other girl’s hands and guiding them along the movements. As they kneaded and spread the dough out together, Agatha’s shoulders began to slump as she relaxed back into Rio’s body. </p><p> </p><p>Rio dipped both of their hands in a little bit of water, bringing them right back to the ball and continuing their ministries. They started flattening the dough out and soon it actually looked like a pizza crust, the memory of its previously mangled corpse fading to the background.</p><p> </p><p>Their hands slowly moved to a stop as their work finished. They stood there for a second, bodies flush together. Rio tried to stay present but the smell of Agatha’s hair began to invade her senses again. Curse her and her weak mind.</p><p> </p><p>“...Thank you..”, Agatha whispered as she turned her head to face Rio’s, bringing their faces inches apart for the tenth time this weekend. Rio had no words that felt sufficient so instead she just gave a curt nod of understanding as she took a step back. </p><p> </p><p>They continued on, decorating their pizzas in a comfortable silence. </p><p> </p><p>Rio itched her cheek, forgetting about the sauce that was still on her hands. Agatha took one look at her and giggled.</p><p> </p><p>“What? Is there something on my face?”, Rio teased as she purposefully wiped more sauce on her face, trying to hear more of Agatha’s laugh. </p><p> </p><p>It worked as Agatha’s giggle turned into a snorting fest, as she folded herself in half at Rio’s shenanigans. Rio let the sound wash over her, breaking out into her own freakishly cheeky grin, her tiny tooth gap on full display. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh no. I think you might have some too!”, Rio mockingly gasped, as she reached out her hands trying to wipe some on Agatha’s face too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to dodge the attack but she was laughing so hard that it was immobilizing her, allowing Rio to successfully get sauce all over her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally pulled herself together, lifting her head to look back up at Rio. She knew she fucked up the second she saw the glint in her eye. Suddenly, Agatha lurched forward, grabbing Rio by the head. Rio didn’t even try to fight it, as she began to have her own intense laughing fit. That’s when Rio felt it. Agatha’s tongue dragging across her cheek cleaning up the sauce. Rio instinctually cringed back, tears running down her eyes, unable to take a full breath in with how hard she was now laughing. </p><p> </p><p>After they put their pizzas in the oven, the two finally started to calm down, wiping their faces off with a wet hand towel from the nearest bathroom. Rio looked around absentmindedly as she wiped at her own face, when she suddenly caught Wanda’s eye. She thought she would have seen anger or hurt there by this point, especially after the performance they just accidentally put on in the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, Rio saw what looked like understanding, watching as Wanda turned back to Natasha and placed a soft kiss on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could think too much of it, Agatha passed by her. When Rio didn't follow she stopped in her tracks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at Rio. She raised her arm up slightly, silently inviting Rio to hold her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The pull in her body was immediate, like they were oppositely charged magnets. One with an instinctual need for the other.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The plans for the rest of the night were simple: get drunk and high while watching classic lesbian movies. The roster they had planned started with </span>
  <em>
    <span>But I’m a Cheerleader, </span>
  </em>
  <span>to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Imagine Me and You, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and then ending with a finale of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Saving Face.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they finished up their pizzas and turned on the first movie, Jen walked around the room passing out edibles and shots to any who wanted some. Rio and Agatha both took their own, excited to mellow out after such an emotionally intense weekend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to the farthest couch from the tv and grabbed herself a blanket to cuddle up under. As the opening credits started, Rio glanced over at Agatha, who was sitting on the other side of the love seat. The TV cast swirling shapes and colors over Agatha’s slightly sunburned skin in the dark room, making it hard for Rio to pull her eyes away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if sensing her gaze, Agatha’s head turned to look back at her, a pout appearing on her face as she took Rio in. She then crossed her arms over her chest, dramatically rubbing them up and down in a motion that would imply someone was feeling cold, an exaggerated shiver running up her spine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio began to blush as she lifted the corner of the blanket, inviting Agatha to come join her. The pout dropped instantly as Agatha quickly scooted herself back, landing under the blankets and into Rio’s open arm. The blanket fell back down around them as they cuddled on the couch, Agatha’s head laying on Rio’s chest, her leg thrown over her waist. The similarities to their positioning in bed this morning did not escape her. Rio suddenly felt as if she had been tossed into a furnace, hot and aware of every point of contact between the two of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Rio was trying to remember how to go back to breathing automatically, Agatha was nuzzling further into her, as if she couldn’t get comfortable until every part of their bodies were touching. Rio felt lucky that she had already seen this movie before, unable to pay attention to anything other than the warm feeling of Agatha pressed against her, as she drew slow patterns over the younger woman’s back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Around fifteen minutes later, her whole body began to tingle as she felt Agatha’s fingers glide along her side, dancing over her clothed hip. She slowly moved the fabric of her shirt up to expose a sliver of her skin, gently rubbing circles into Rio’s bare toned abdomen. The move immediately created fireworks in Rio’s stomach, making it hard for her to manually take a full breath in. The spot Agatha was rubbing felt as if it was sending electrical charges throughout her body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All thoughts immediately left Rio’s head as Agatha grew bolder, dragging the tips of her fingers higher under Rio’s shirt as the movie went on, spreading her hand possessively over her bare ribs. There is no chance Agatha can’t sense her heartbeat as she feels herself struggling to swallow around the pulse in her throat. A quick glance around the room tells Rio that Wanda’s not even looking at them, the position of their couch was out of everyone’s peripheral vision. Even if she did turn around, everything Agatha is doing is being covered by the blanket they are sharing. This isn’t a performance, this is just for Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A familiar coil begins to tighten in Rio’s lower stomach as she feels Agatha begin to lightly drag her nails back and forth over her skin. The thought of Agatha leaving scratches on her body has Rio’s underwear beginning to feel damp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instinctually, the hold Rio’s arm has around Agatha begins to tighten, bringing their bodies as close together as physically possible. This move causes Agatha to shift herself slightly until she ends up fully laying on top of Rio, her body weight pressing down on Rio deliciously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s legs fall open as her new position allows her to straddle one of Rio’s thighs, allowing her to feel the heat coming off of Agatha’s core. It takes every muscle in Rio’s body working together to restrain herself from bucking her hips upwards. Instead, Rio decides to play with fire, slightly tensing the thigh that Agatha is nearly rubbing herself against. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio is immediately rewarded when she hears the tiniest whimper come from Agatha’s throat, loud enough for only Rio to hear. Rio has to fight her body’s natural instinct again, the urge to make Agatha grind against her thigh almost overwhelming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her internal battle must be more obvious than she thought as Agatha lifts her head off of Rio’s chest, looking up at her with fully dilated eyes, all of the blue swallowed by the black of her pupils in this light. Her cheeks are flushed and her breath is coming out faster, almost as if she is having just as hard of a time restraining herself. Her legs start subtly squeezing around Rio’s thigh looking for more friction, her nipples barely poking through the thin band shirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio feels herself struggle to gulp, her dry throat straining as it attempts to take in fresh air. It’s all too much and not enough at the same time. Rio feels her self-control slipping by the second, the desire in Agatha’s gaze triggering a gush of wetness to further soak Rio’s briefs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, a thought dawns on her. She is very very high. Like super high. Fuck. The edible must have finally kicked in. Agatha must be off her ass right now, the younger of the pair always having a lower tolerance. Rio needs to get Agatha a safe distance away from her until they are both back in their right minds. Or at least until they are by themselves. Rio is definitely not an exhibitionist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hands immediately find Agatha’s hips, effortlessly lifting her off of her body. Agatha’s eyes go wide in surprise as she lands flat on her butt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyone want popcorn? I am going to go make popcorn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio jumps to her feet, not risking a glance back towards Agatha as she heads to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my God yesss make a few bags, please.” Alice whines from her spot in Jen’s arms. Rio realizes everyone else's edibles have also probably just kicked in, buying her time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me help you with that.” Agatha says before Rio can fully make it into the kitchen space, jogging to catch up with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nobody spares them a second glance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio opens the cabinet door and grabs the box of popcorn they bought from the store earlier. She takes the bag out of the plastic wrap and tosses it into the microwave, trying her best to avoid looking directly at any part of Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once she hits the popcorn button and the familiar hum fills the space, she realizes that she can feel Agatha’s eyes burning a hole into the back of her head. Knowing that she was only really avoiding the inevitable, Rio turns around to face her best friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had mentally prepared herself for almost any outcome. Expecting to see anger, confusion, or even maybe intrigue painting Agatha’s features. What she saw there instead made the knots in her stomach pull taut, her pussy clenching around nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was looking at her with pure unadulterated lust. She had leaned herself against the granite top island, directly behind Rio, her chest heaving underneath Rio’s shirt. Her eyes had a look that Rio had never seen on her face before. She looked like a predator, like Rio was the deer she was hunting. Agatha spared one last glance over her shoulder towards the living room before she grabbed Rio’s hand and silently led her out the backdoor, where the house connects to the beach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second the door shut behind them, Agatha shoved Rio against the outside wall, the sounds of waves in the distance barely audible over the blood rushing in Rio’s ears. For a second, they didn’t say anything to each other. Agatha’s eyes moved back and forth on Rio’s face, appearing as if she was trying to read her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, without warning, Agatha took a step forward, closing the distance between them in an instance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m going to kiss you now.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio barely even heard it before Agatha rose to her tippy-toes, grabbed Rio’s jaw, and pulled her in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When their lips met, it was slow, tentative at first. Agatha’s lips were softer than anything Rio has ever felt. Her entire body started to feel as if it was floating, her mind going completely blank. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if they had done it a million times, Rio’s arms instinctually rose to grip Agatha’s waist, using the new leverage to spin Agatha around, pushing her against the wall of the home. She felt a moan slip out of Agatha’s mouth as her back hit the structure. Rio swallowed it immediately and attempted to deepen the kiss, running her tongue over Agatha’s bottom lip. Agatha immediately parted her lips to let Rio in, making it Rio’s turn to moan as she finally tasted the inside of Agatha’s mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the sound Rio made, Agatha went feral in her arms, taking control of the situation and flipping their positions once more. Agatha nipped at Rio’s lips before she broke them apart, only to immediately drop her mouth down to Rio’s neck, finding one of the previous hickeys she left there and reattaching herself to it. The still bruised skin was extra sensitive, Agatha’s harsh sucking causing the pain to mix with the pleasure, goosebumps breaking out across Rio’s body. The groan Rio let out came from somewhere deep within her, a sound she is positive she has never once made before, certain she has never been so turned on in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hands explored Agatha’s body, encouraging her to continue. Eventually they landed on Agatha’s ass, still covered by Rio’s boxers. Remembering that they were doing this while Agatha was in her clothes sent another jolt through Rio’s body, making her feel confident that her wetness was probably visible through her own shorts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Agatha started to make her way down to Rio’s chest, following the same path her mouth had made at the club, an annoying beeping sound startled the two of them apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The microwave…? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The popcorn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They give each other one last look before silently slipping back inside. Rio moves to the incessant appliance first, opening the door to stop the tune that plays when your food is ready. She quickly opens the bag, burning her fingers a bit in the process but too out-of-body to care. She pours the bag's contents into a giant bowl and hobbles it over to their friends, who are still cluelessly enjoying the film. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice looks up at her with dazed, glassy eyes, “You are my hero, Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grabs a solid fist full of popcorn and shoves it into her mouth while giggling. Seeing Alice so at ease helps to lower Rio’s heart rate for a second, giving her mind time to catch up with what happened outside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you going to make another bag?” Alice questions, bringing her back to the present. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed affirmatively, speed walking back to the kitchen where Agatha was already putting the next bag in the microwave. The second she pressed start, she grabbed Rio’s hand and led her outside once more, this time with no preamble. Their mouths were together the second the door shut behind them, immediately returning to their previous intensity. Rio pressed a leg between Agatha’s thighs, cradling the back of her head to prevent it from hitting the wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grinded herself down, letting soft whimpers out against Rio’s mouth. Rio’s other hand made its way to Agatha’s chest, swiping over her clothed nipple. The sensation caused Agatha to arch into her touch as she let out a breathless gasp, another sound Rio immediately swallowed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had never wanted anyone so bad in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>More, Rio. I need more..”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha whispered, trying to be mindful of their location. A string of saliva connecting their kiss swollen lips as Agatha’s head began to fall backwards, a needy whine erupting from her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Rio’s hand moved from Agatha’s chest, making its way down to her boxers, the beep from the microwave startled them apart once more. Rio jumped back as far as physically possible, remembering that they are not in fact the last two people on earth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha immediately let out another shameless whine at the loss of pressure, before she too remembered their situation. They both made their way back inside, putting the new bag of popcorn into another bowl. Rio was finding it difficult to walk properly with how turned on she was, every brush of fabric against her body felt like it was touching a raw nerve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, can you come get a sweater with me from the room?” came Agatha’s voice from behind her, sounding steadier than she had moments ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio just hummed in agreement, afraid she was never going to be able to trust her voice again. They both headed to the stairs, Rio taking them two at a time, everyone else too high to care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they arrived in their room, Agatha closed the door and pushed Rio down onto the bed, climbing on top of her and straddling her waist. She reattached their lips immediately, grinding herself against Rio’s lap with a new sense of purpose. The noises spilling between them were absolutely filthy, and Rio realized she would never get enough. Agatha was going to ruin her for everyone else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Weed always heightened the experience but she had never felt anything like this in her life. As Agatha pulled away for a breath, Rio watched a few tears of frustration run down her cheeks. Her hair was a mess from Rio’s hands and sweat started to bead on her temples. She looked absolutely wrecked and Rio hadn’t even touched her yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She realized that maybe they were always meant to end up like this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remembering the weed part made Rio pause. They were both definitely still very high, and while Rio had fucked other people this high, they had always given enthusiastic verbal consent first. It also didn’t normally happen on her first time with someone. They needed to talk. Rio pulled back her face, disconnecting herself from Agatha’s lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was about to chase after her when Rio put her hands up, effectively stopping the moment. The girl on her lap looked at her confused, letting out a soft whine at the interruption. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ I just wanted to check in quickly,” Rio’s voice came out as a hoarse whisper, “are you sure you want to do this Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head to the side like a dog. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ It’s just that I know we are both high, and we have been blurring the lines all weekend… I just want to make sure that you are sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio. I am currently grinding against your lap right now,” Agatha says with exasperation in her voice. She then grabs Rio’s hand, bringing it up to her still clothed core.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Feel for yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasps when Agatha guides her to feel the drenched fabric of the bottoms. A quick look down and Rio can see where the wetness expanded from. Agatha’s slick had soaked through both her panties and Rio’s boxers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have never been more sure of anything in my life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha keeps Rio’s hand pressed against her as she tentatively rolls her hips down into it, the angle allowing for Rio to get friction as well. Rio thinks she might be seeing heaven as she watches Agatha do it again, using Rio’s hand to get herself off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio. Please.</span>
  <em>
    <span> I need you to touch me.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” she whines needily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As much as Rio wants to help, take control, move her hand, or do literally anything, she is frozen there. As Agatha picks up a pace against Rio’s stiff fingers, Rio feels her muscles begin to lock up. The view she has causes the knot in her gut to feel like it is exploding, as her toes curl and her back hits an almost impossible arch. She doesn’t realize that she is finishing until Agatha looks down, pausing her hips as her eyes go wide. Rio fights through her orgasmic haze to see what Agatha is looking at.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Rio thought Agatha had drenched her boxers, then the front of Rio’s shorts looked like they had been dipped into the ocean. The material of the shorts were so wet that they clung to Rio’s thighs, the white of the fabric becoming almost transparent. Rio tried hard not to feel bad for the Snoopys on her shorts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she finally came down, she felt her skin start to grow red in shame, as she realized that she had soaked through the fabric of her sleep shorts when she essentially came untouched, before either of them even took any clothes off. Agatha seems to come to the same conclusion, letting out an animalistic growl and beginning her movements once more, doubling down on her efforts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio– Jesus Christ, fuck</span>
  <em>
    <span> baby</span>
  </em>
  <span>. That was so fuc– oh my God,” Agatha mindlessly babbles as she builds herself up to orgasm, her nails digging into the flesh of Rio’s wrist, while her other hand grabs the front of Rio's shirt for support. Rio can hear how wet Agatha is, pornographic noises following each stuttering of her hips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The combination of shame and the view of Agatha using her to get off begins to start growing something deeper in Rio’s stomach. She can feel how wet her hand is, covered in both of them, and it only spurs her on more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio starts moving her hips back against Agatha’s, meeting her pace. Definitely the right call as her best friend is only able to survive two more rolls of her hips before her body also locks up, her face pinching in absolute bliss as she lets out a final whimper. The view alone is enough to make Rio topple over the edge again, biting her lip to try and hide the guttural moan that was waiting at the bottom of her throat as her free hand holds onto Agatha’s hip for dear life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After Agatha rides out the rest of her orgasm, she falls face first into Rio’s shoulder, sweaty and completely spent. Rio’s hand remains trapped between them, not that she minds. Rio thinks that she would stay like this forever if Agatha let her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha adjusts so that she releases Rio’s hand, moving her legs so that she is once again cuddled against Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Why’d you make me wait so long?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha mumbles against Rio’s neck, sounding exhausted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio feels her heart drop as she processes the meaning of Agatha’s words. Had she been wanting this too? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Rio can ask her to elaborate, there is a knock at their door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both of their heads rise off the bed at the sound, turning to face the source of the noise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha? It’s me. Can we talk?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fucking Wanda.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groans against Rio’s neck, lifting her body on shaky arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She quickly takes off her boxers, grabbing new ones from Rio’s luggage. She stops by the mirror to fix her hair, wiping the sweat and tears off of her face. Once she is satisfied with her appearance, she gives Rio one last look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stay here. I will be back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she is gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lets her head fall back onto the mattress, the wet material of her shorts quickly chilling against her without Agatha’s body heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She strips them off, trying not to think too hard about what just happened. She needs to wait for Agatha to come back so that they can talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why’d you make me wait so long?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sentence plays over and over again in Rio’s head. What could that mean?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She makes good on Agatha’s command, staying put in the room waiting for her return.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hops in the shower, brushes her teeth, changes into a fresh set of pajamas, and tucks herself into bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She checks the time… Fuck. It has only been 15 minutes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Waiting is so fucking hard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What does Wanda want with her anyway? Had their plan worked? Is she jealous and crawling back to Agatha? Was this all a part of Agatha’s plan from the start? Bring poor Rio up here to pluck at Wanda’s final straw?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio is spiraling rapidly, unable to stop her thoughts. She lays on her back and stares at the ceiling running through every second of the last two days, hoping to point out something she missed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She comes up empty over and over again, her mind somehow always circling back to the same question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Where the fuck is Agatha?</span>
  </em>

  <p>
  <span>Five more silent minutes pass and Rio knows she can’t do this anymore. She feels like she is going insane. The only effects of the edible that remain seem to be intense paranoia. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Why would Agatha leave her after what they did if it wasn’t a mistake? Jesus, Rio really is pathetic. This is embarrassing even by her own standards. Why does she always read every situation wrong? Friends kiss each other all the time. Sure things got intense but they were both super high. It doesn’t mean that things have changed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gets out of bed and starts pacing around the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She has really done it this time. Agatha and Wanda are probably laughing right now about how desperate Rio was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She flushes at the memory. Agatha hadn’t even touched her and she finished so hard that she ruined her shorts. Agatha had begged her to touch her and she just laid there doing nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then Agatha had left to talk with her very recent ex, which has never boded well for any lesbians in the past. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She is so fucked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She starts grabbing the clothes around their room, and hastily packing them away, just in case Agatha and Wanda want to come back in here. She leaves her snoopy shorts and the wet boxers Agatha was wearing hanging in the bathroom, not wanting to ruin the rest of her clothes by putting them in her bag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This may be an overreaction but it is best to be prepared for the worst case scenario. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once she is all packed, she takes a step back and pauses. She can feel her throat start to tighten as tears begin to fill her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She needs water. She needs to sober up so she can start thinking clearly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s request be damned, Rio heads out of the room and down to the kitchen to grab herself a glass of water from the tap. As she sips on it, her eyes flutter shut, and she feels her heart rate start to come down. Everything is going to be okay. She just needs to wait for Agatha to be done so that they can talk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Feeling much better, Rio reopens her eyes, putting the cup back down on the counter. As she does, something outside the window catches her eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, at least she knows where Agatha is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From where she is standing, Rio can see the backs of the two girls. They are standing close together, smoking cigarettes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay! Not too bad! Maybe it’s to help them deal with their hard conversation, where they are agreeing to officially move on?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watches Wanda let out a laugh as Agatha bumps her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A little chummy but nothing incriminating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reaches out and gently touches Wanda’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Definitely not a fan of that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda puts her cigarette out and turns to Agatha, bringing her into a big hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio suddenly feels very cold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How could she be so fucking stupid? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course Agatha doesn’t want her. She hasn’t wanted her for the past 5 years, why would she want her now?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio puts her cup in the sink with a little too much force. She goes upstairs and grabs her bags. She’s not sure she would be able to look Agatha in the eyes now anyway. She doesn’t think she can survive the pity she will find there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha got lost in the moment. They both did! Maybe they can talk it out but right now? Rio needs to get as far away from here as possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As far away from Agatha as possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one is sober enough to drive anywhere but the nearest bus station is a 45 minute walk. If she leaves now she can make the 10:30pm bus back to Boston, and she will figure it out from there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With one last look around, Rio holds her breath to stop herself from crying. She closes the door and makes her way downstairs and out the front door. She will send Alice a text apologizing later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tears stream freely down her face as she makes her way into the dark, guided by street lights and her phone’s GPS, even though it only has 7% battery left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finally had her shot with Agatha and she blew it by being pathetic. At least now she can officially move on, confident in the fact that she will never have Agatha the way she has wanted her since the first night they met. This was the closest she would ever get and she needed to learn how to be okay with that.</span>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">**************</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Stay here. I will be back.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha says to Rio as she opens the door to the hallway. She sees Wanda standing at the far end of the corridor, leaning against the wall. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolls her eyes at the sight, annoyed that anyone would dare to interrupt them when they had just finished their warmups. As the thought crosses her mind, Agatha bites down on the inside of her cheek trying to hide her smile. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She fucking did it!</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She essentially told Rio exactly how she felt! She may have used her body but you know what they always say? Actions speak louder than words, and Agatha is not good at talking about her feelings. There should be no doubt left in Rio’s mind now, all of her cards are on the table. This might make her vulnerable but at least it is finally all out in the open.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Now, all she has to do is get this conversation out of the way, so she can go back up to Rio and give her way more than just dry humping… even if the dry humping was admittedly amazing. Just the thought of finally feeling Rio inside of her has her clenching around nothing, the earlier orgasm acting as a perfect appetizer. If that is how Rio reacted to her fully clothed, then she cannot imagine the look on the older girl’s face when Agatha shows her how long she has been dreaming of this moment. She winces as her soaked cotton panties rub against her in a way that is both uncomfortable and perfect, a reminder of what her and Rio just did. They won’t be a problem when she gets back to the room and takes them off…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you coming, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>

    <span>Once we wrap this up, I will be.</span>

  <span>“Lead the way, Red.” Agatha says instead, knowing that provoking Wanda right now will only drag this out further, keeping her away from Rio for longer.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>They make their way downstairs, passing the living room full of stoned sapphics watching Natasha Lyonne perform her cheer routine at the graduation ceremony. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Classic. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>If Agatha didn’t have better things to do upstairs, she would have loved to finish her eighth rewatch of this movie. But no. Instead she gets to enjoy neither as Wanda leads her out the backdoor that she and Rio were using to sneakily make out. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>As they move closer to the beach, Agatha glances back at the spot Rio had pushed her against the wall. Her stomach is all butterflies as she starts to feel the phantom sensations of Rio’s hands on her body. She loves being thrown around and Rio is so strong that she seems to do it without even realizing she is being rough. Just the thought of Rio’s biceps and her tight grip is making Agatha’s core feel achingly empty. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“You want one?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Oh right. She is fucking outside. With fucking Wanda. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>The other girl holding out a cigarette for Agatha to grab.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Well, who is she to say no to a cigarette after sex? Greg Gonzalez would never forgive her.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha takes the cigarette from Wanda’s fingers, placing it into her mouth and instinctually leaning forward for Wanda to light it. She stops herself right intime, pulling her head back and holding her hand out for the lighter instead, remembering that they don’t do that anymore.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda rolls her eyes but complies, handing the Bic over to her.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>They sit there in silence for a few minutes, looking out into the darkness of the beach and listening to the waves as they hit their cigarettes.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“So… The Red Sox beat the Yankees last week?” Agatha starts off with a joke, unable to have a normal adult conversation.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda, already used to her quirks, ignores her, choosing to go straight for the jugular instead.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“So… You and Rio.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Not a question. A fact.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah… Rio and I…”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>It is starting to come back to Agatha, through her marijuana and sex induced haze that this all started because of Wanda. Kind of…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing to worry about, my ass.” Wanda chuckles to herself bitterly, taking another drag of her cigarette.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha internally winces at the memory Wanda’s words recall, vaguely remembering something similar coming out of her own mouth at some point. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“I fucking called this, Agatha. You two have been in love for years at this point.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s jaw drops. What the fuck? She hasn’t been that obvious, has she?</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“You think I didn’t notice all of those secret glances? The way she hated me and the way you hated anyone she brought around? I may have been in love but I wasn’t stupid, and neither of you were subtle...”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Y–You think she’s in love with me?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda scoffs to herself. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesus fucking Christ, Agatha. Read the room.” Wanda rolls her eyes, as Agatha stares at her, mouth agape and cheeks dusted with a faint blush. Her features soften a little at the sincerity in Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“...She looks at you the way Julian Edelman looked at Tom Brady.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face drops a little, her eyebrows furrowing. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>…</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What the fuck does that even mean?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Is this a sports thing Wanda? Did you just quote football to me? If you are going to waste both of our time, I am going back inside–” Agatha threatens, as she starts turning her body back toward the house.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay wait! I’m sorry, I’ll stop. I’m just feeling a little upset right now and I know how much you hate organized sports.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>It’s true. Agatha does. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>When Wanda’s parents immigrated from Sokovia to Massachusetts, they really embraced the cultural love of New England sports. This made that one dinner that Agatha had with them really awkward. It’s not her fault that she said she finds the whole thing boring. What kind of psychopath makes a game where it takes an hour to get through 15 minutes?</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“At first, I thought you might be trying to make me jealous, but the more I watched you two… especially after today, it’s clear what you guys have is real. I don’t know why this is surprising to you anyway. When did the two of you officially get together?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>At that, Agatha grimaces. Oh right.. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She quickly recovers, plastering a saccharine smile on her face. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, Wands–”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my God. You’re kidding me.” Wanda interrupts her, shaking her head in disbelief while taking another long hit from her cigarette.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“ I haven’t even said anything yet!” Agatha snaps back.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet, I still know that you were about to lie to my face. You just put on the face you use when you are lying!”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“I do not have a lying face!”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you do.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“My God, this is pointless! I feel like I am talking to a child. What the fuck is going on, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tries her hardest to make her face go blank. “We actually aren’t technically dating. We haven’t really talked about it yet.” </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Not technically a lie.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Well, now that someone has finally brought it up…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“... Honestly? I don’t know where we stand right now. It’s all a bit complicated.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“How so?”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well I have had a crush on her for years but it never happened naturally so I tried dating other people, hoping it would go away. It clearly didn’t work, and then you had to bring that goddess on this trip and rub your stupid happiness in my face. So I concocted a scheme to piss you off while also having an excuse to throw myself at Rio, to maintain plausible deniability in case she rejected me. But she didn’t and then we made out and got each other off about 5 minutes ago, until you rudely interrupted. </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“It just is.” Agatha says instead. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you should go talk to her about it. I still care about you Agatha. I just want to see you happy, and it is clear that she makes you happy.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez Einstein, that is a peachy idea. If only my ex didn’t come knocking on the door while I was in a room alone with her.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda lets out a sarcastic laugh, throwing her head back dramatically. “Well, Natasha and I are doing great too, thanks for asking.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bumps her shoulder as she takes one last hit of her cigarette. They always did have good banter, even towards the end. It was never going to work between the two of them romantically, but Agatha is happy that she feels like they can stay friends.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>God, this weekend has been filled with stereotypes and tropes.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Fake dating? Only one bed? Lesbians being friends with their exes? How was she supposed to survive this infuriating romcom shit. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She puts out her cigarette and looks over at Wanda, unfortunately feeling grateful that they talked. Stupid, understanding Wanda.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Not knowing the best way to communicate this thought, Agatha reaches over and gives Wanda an awkward pat on her back. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda can’t help but laugh, like she can read Agatha’s mind. She puts out her own cigarette, turning towards Agatha. “I’m going to hug you now.” she states matter of factly, already closing in.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please don’t– and you’ve already grabbed me. Okay.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>They stand there connected for an uncomfortable second, hugging in a way that would betray the fact that they dated for 5 months.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulls away first, giving Wanda a rare soft smile. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyway,” Agatha clears her throat, “good luck with Nancy in there. I guess you could do worse.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Moment over.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda lets out another laugh, determined to see through Agatha’s defensive walls.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for that. Now, please go talk to Rio. You’re going to give that poor girl a heart attack.”</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gives Wanda one last nod of acknowledgement. She heads back to the house, less horny than before but more determined to figure things out with Rio. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She stops by the bathroom to freshen up before going upstairs, the stickiness between her thighs having become more of a nuisance than anything. If this conversation goes the way Agatha hopes it is going to go, she is sure it won’t take long to get back to this level of wetness anyway. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She finally makes it to the bedroom door. She takes one deep big breath and swings it open, ready to lay it all on the line. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Empty?</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Okay…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She looks to Rio’s side of the room and realizes that all of her stuff is gone. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She pokes her head into the bathroom to make sure but yep, it’s empty too. The only indication Rio was ever here are their wet shorts hanging over the shower rod to dry.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe Agatha misread something? Maybe Rio doesn’t want her like that…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Why did she ever trust stupid Wanda’s opinion?</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She heads back downstairs at a pace that some may describe as careless, looking for Rio all over the house. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She is nowhere to be found. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>If she is not inside the house, then that means…</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She wouldn’t be stupid enough to go outside by herself high would she? </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha brings her hands up to cover her face, letting out a dramatic, long suffering sigh. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Why can’t things ever just be easy? She is too fucking high for this.</span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>She heads out the front door, hoping Rio hasn’t made it too far. She turns her head to the left and to the right, trying to find a hint that would lead her in the direction Rio went. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>Nothing but darkness surrounds her on all sides, the only light coming from the few street lamps scattered throughout the road. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
  <span>As she picks a direction, the same one they took when they walked to the club last night, she feels herself begin to panic. </span>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Agatha picks up her pace, unsure of when Rio left but knowing that she probably has a substantial head start.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What if she never finds Rio? What if she hurt herself somewhere out here?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit…” Agatha whispers under her breath, aware that she is probably freaking herself out because she is high but unable to stop the spiral. Tears of panic start welling in her eyes as she tries to see through the darkness, her throat feeling like it is starting to tighten.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes of speed walking in one direction, she stumbles upon the club that they went to last night. Wanting water and to take a second to calm down, Agatha heads inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The space is less crowded than it was the night before but there was still a substantial amount of people around. Agatha heads straight to the bar, worried that she was going to start choking on her tongue soon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushes through the crowd, ending up in the same corner she sat in with Rio the previous night. A memory that had been filling her chest with warmth the past 24 hours suddenly only made her feel dread. She would get this water and then get back out there, hoping that wherever Rio went was well lit, walking around in the darkness was starting to make her feel even more anxious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After snapping at the server to get his attention, and being hit with a lone index finger, her eyes started drifting around the bar, subconsciously wanting to get a better idea of her surroundings while she waited.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, her eyes landed on one figure, sitting on the floor against the far back wall of the club. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Forgetting all about her water, Agatha’s body immediately steps forward, being called to the other girl’s presence in an instant. Before she even fully realizes it, she is standing in front of the woman who has taken up an unnatural amount of space in her brain for years, her best friend. The one that she is stupidly charmed by and probably hopelessly in love with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sensing her presence, Rio’s eyes snap up to Agatha’s, this angle allowing the younger girl to take in her tear stained cheeks and red puffy eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the sight, her heart wants to clench but her throat wants to scream, her blood boiling with useless adrenaline. She feels like a mom about to reprimand her kid for stepping out into the middle of a busy street without looking, and she hates it. Yet, she can’t stop her fearful desperation from spilling out of her mouth, a waterfall of panicked heartfelt sentiment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio Vidal, what the absolute fuck is wrong with you? Who do you think you are to wander out here by yourself, making me worried and almost sick. I thought something terrible happened to you. I thought you left me. If you don’t want me, you are going to need to tell me to my face. I need to hear you say it, and I swear we can move on from this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha is proud she got it all out, even if she doesn’t actually think she could ever move on from Rio, especially after finally getting a taste of what she has been missing out on for all of these years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I want you, Agatha. That’s the fucking problem.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was Agatha’s turn to blink back at Rio speechless, her eyes widening in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>If Rio wants her, then what the fuck are they fighting about?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Get up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What..?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said get the fuck up Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio obediently stands in an instant, bags forgotten on the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabs Rio’s wrist, uninterested in dragging this out for another second. They can continue this fight somewhere private, where their hands can get a headstart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Stumbling upon a single stall bathroom, Agatha practically kicks the door in, still leading the way. She locks the door behind them as Rio stumbles into the room ahead of her, still looking a little lost. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have got to stop meeting like this,” Agatha tries to joke, but it comes out breathless and wrecked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looks like she wants to speak but Agatha is afraid to give her the chance. She takes two big steps towards Rio, backing her up against the wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Say it again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Say what again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me, Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stands stock still for ten brutal seconds, looking down at Agatha with a dumbstruck face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More than I’ve ever wanted anything in my entire life.” Rio gets out in a whisper, voice cracking over her confession. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath catches in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Show me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Within an instant Rio closes the distance between the two of them, slotting their lips together as if they were designed to never be apart. Her hands come up to gently cradle Agatha’s face, a direct contrast to her teeth and tongue, that are insistently working against Agatha’s own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is desperate from the start, almost as if neither of them thought they would ever get the chance again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha can feel her pulse beating rapidly at the bottom of her throat. The ache that had dulled between her legs coming back full force, the power of it coercing a whimper out from somewhere deep in her chest. She has kissed so many people in bars, and yet she cannot remember the last time someone made her feel like this. She doesn’t think anyone has ever made her feel like this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands moved down from Agatha’s face, trailing along her back and pulling her closer, as if it was even possible. Rio flipped their positions, pushing Agatha against the wall. Instinctually, Agatha’s leg came up and wrapped around Rio’s waist. Rio got the hint, grabbing at the outside of her thigh and pushing her crotch up against Agatha’s center. Agatha had to bite her tongue as she tried to hide how good it felt to have Rio in between her legs. Her other hand came up to the back of Agatha’s neck, getting a tight grip in her long hair as she cradled the back of her head, protecting it from banging into the wall as she thrusted her hips forward, setting a brutal pace. The grind was delicious, Agatha almost did not realize her hands coming up to grab at Rio’s back, nails scratching into her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Rio had a dick, it would be tenting her pajama shorts, which Agatha didn’t even realize she was still wearing. They were both technically in pajamas, making out and grinding in a club bathroom on a Saturday night. Definitely not how she imagined their first time, but she cannot fathom the idea of waiting a second longer. She is done being patient.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Rio’s tongue licked into Agatha’s mouth, her leg tightened, forcing Rio to still, pressed flush against her cunt. Impatiently ignoring the request, Rio gave another slow roll of her hips, pulling a feral growl from Agatha’s throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She could have done this forever but she was officially sick of dry humping. She needed to feel her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She needed the real thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” she whispered as she pulled back, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I need you inside of me right now.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Here?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio questioned breathlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her lips were wet and swollen from where Agatha had been biting them. Her chest was heaving, her pupils blown, and her cheeks flushed. She looked beautiful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her body burn at the sight. All of this was because of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her blood felt like lava in her veins, her body wanting to respond to Rio’s hesitation by kicking and screaming, tantruming until Rio gave in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead, using all of the self restraint left in her body, she dropped her head back against the wall and groaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tears were starting to form in her eyes, her desperation demanding to be seen as it attempted to leak out of her body. Every nerve felt like it was on fire, her desire causing physical pain deep within her core. Even her limbs were starting to tremble, the leg supporting her threatening to buckle under her weight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Baby, please..”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha got out, certain those two words were the extent of her verbal capabilities in this moment. She could hardly hold herself up without Rio’s support, nevermind create a case for why she needed to feel Rio against her cervix in a club bathroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It only took Rio seconds to process her plea, her dominant hand immediately dropping from Agatha’s hair, finding the hem of her boxers instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her fingers danced around the edges, teasing for a moment, but Agatha’s subsequent growl compelled her to pick up the pace. They held eye contact as Rio’s hand moved lower, making its way inside Agatha’s boxer shorts, creating a bulge there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The moment Rio touched the outside of Agatha’s panties, her eyes rolled into the back of her head, letting out an almost inhuman moan. Agatha had a good guess at what she was feeling, her underwear probably so thoroughly soaked that she would need to throw them out after this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seemingly unable to wait a moment longer, Rio pushed the crotch of the drenched fabric aside, her fingers immediately landing in Agatha’s swollen heat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, a sense of relief washing over her body at the feeling of Rio’s reverent touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rather than reattaching their lips, Rio’s head dipped down, latching onto Agatha’s neck like a mirror of the night before. Her fingers drew a slow path from Agatha’s clit to her entrance, the surrounding flesh covered in Agatha’s arousal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her fingertips paused just outside of where Agatha needed them, a silent question, a chance to back out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Having lost the ability for complex speech minutes ago, Agatha could do nothing but finish the movement, sinking herself onto Rio’s slender, slightly curled fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha heard it in the air but was unsure from whom it came from. Both of her hands immediately shot up Rio’s back, cradling her head, and pushing her best friend further into her own neck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s legs were already shaking and Rio hadn’t even started moving yet, giving Agatha a second to get used to the feeling of being full. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a slow draw back, Rio’s fingers sunk back into her, deep and hard. All of the air knocked out of Agatha’s lungs as her back thudded against the wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her whole body clench in reaction, involuntarily squeezing down on Rio’s fingers, drawing her in deeper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled out and pushed in again, picking up a slow torturous pace. The sounds of Rio’s fingers fucking her filled the room, leaving nothing to the imagination for anyone that walked by the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>You feel so good.. perfect for me baby..”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’re so pretty.. I never want to stop fucking you..”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha could barely hear Rio’s words over the blood rushing in her ears. It sounded like she was whispering prayers at an altar, Agatha her benevolent God for allowing her the honor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somehow, Rio seemed to be hitting the right spot on every thrust, the pads of her pointer and middle fingers dragging along her front walls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt nothing but pure bliss. Every stroke, every bite, felt perfectly timed, a well conducted symphony falling from her lips, unable to quiet her moans. She felt like puddy, happy to take any shape she was molded into as long as it was by Rio’s hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t seem much better off, she pulled away from Agatha’s neck, needing to catch her breath. Her face was a deep red, screwed up in pleasure as if she was the one being touched. Agatha somehow noted that she was grinding her hips forward against her own wrist with every thrust, allowing her to put more power behind her hand, while also giving her the ability to derive her own pleasure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Knowing that Rio was getting off on being inside of her, only brought Agatha closer to the edge, her own orgasm hurtling towards her uncontrollably.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Baby– w-wait Rio, s-sto-p-p</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Agatha tried to get out, tried to warn her, but her voice was too broken and too late. Her back lifted off of the wall, arching towards Rio’s body. She felt her vision go hazy, her eyes unable to remain open any longer. She was vaguely aware that tears were actively flowing down her face, as Rio thrusted into her with one last snap of her hips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her whole body went tense, the leg around Rio’s waist squeezing the other girl closer until there was not an inch of space between them, Rio’s fingers buried to the knuckle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she felt it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes into the back of her head as her underwear began to fill with a hot heat, pooling in Rio’s hand and running smoothly down her thighs. She had never felt anything like it, and when Rio noticed her hips instinctually shot forward, pushing her fingers impossibly deeper into Agatha with a jolt. The action causes a second smaller orgasm to wash over Agatha immediately, as she lets out a high pitched sob.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***********</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After what feels like five minutes, they still haven’t moved. Agatha’s forehead rests on Rio’s shoulder, her fingers still deeply nestled inside of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turns her head to place kisses over Agatha’s hair, silently praising her for how well she performed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna take them out now, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nods wordlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio slides her fingers out gently, meeting no resistance in what remains of Agatha’s slick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha lets out a soft gasp, more tears starting to spill over her freshly dried cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh God.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is she crying?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio is struck with panic as a soft sob escapes Agatha’s throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hand pulls out of Agatha’s shorts in a flash.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh God, Agatha? Did I hurt you? Are you okay?” she gets out in one breath, feeling terrible at the thought that she could have upset her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, it’s n-not that… </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck I’m sorry</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Agatha responds between sobs as she frantically wipes at her cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moves to take a step back, to give the girl space, but Agatha’s hands immediately shoot out to her shoulders, pulling her back in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio feels herself instantly calm, wrapping her arms back around Agatha’s waist tightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I don’t know w-why I’m crying now. I have just needed that for so l-long and I was so worried about you earlier, a-and I am just so happy. It feels like an emotional dam just burst somewhere in my body.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whispers against Rio’s neck as her body trembles with every sob. Her fingers start rubbing circles into Agatha’s back as she holds her, trying to help sooth her best friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t ever worry me like that again,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>she hears, so soft that she’s not sure if she imagined it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After some time, they finally pull apart, the music from the club starting to filter back in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should definitely get out of here now, hopefully before they ban us for life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would have been worth it.” Rio says with a cheeky grin and a wink. Agatha snorts mildly amused as she grabs paper towels cleaning the liquid off of herself and the floor. Rio slips out of the door quickly, heading back to her earlier spot, to grab her stuff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She headed back into the bathroom, handing Agatha a new pair of shorts to wear, the ones Rio had worn to dinner the night before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have any pajama shorts left?” Agatha whines. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Someone just ruined my last pair actually. I only brought so many for a three day trip,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pretends to look disgruntled as she changes but Rio can see the smile tugging at the corner of her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her face is soft and swollen from the tears, her eyes sparkling in the warm light of the dim bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How can someone look so pretty immediately after they cry?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They check themselves in the mirror one more time, and head out of the space. They move quickly with their heads down, grateful for the two other bathroom options that most likely saved them from being interrupted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They make it outside, being saved from the embarrassment of a confrontation. They start heading back to the rental house, sharing the responsibility of carrying Rio’s bags.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why did you leave?” Rio hears Agatha ask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looks over at her best friend, who looks soft and small, who is staring back at her with vulnerable eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I um.. I thought maybe Wanda had wanted you back, figured there was no way to compete with that, and that it was probably best to vacate the room before you guys, uh.. Needed it...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stops in her tracks as Rio’s words sink in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What part of ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Stay here. I will be back</span>
  </em>
  <span>.’ made you think I wanted Wanda?” Agatha says incredulously, feeling like she might be misunderstanding Rio’s words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stops walking a step ahead of her. “ I saw the two of you… at the beach,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She doesn’t dare turn back towards her, feeling a little foolish in retrospect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh don’t tell me you’re the possessive type,” Agatha snorts as she starts walking again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Says you, I thought you were going to take off the hand of that poor girl at the bookstore today.” Rio teases back, happy Agatha doesn’t seem mad at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Spoke too soon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head whips around to shoot an icy glare at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve only just started dating and you’re already on thin ice, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio immediately shrinks back with a gulp, until the full sentence processes in her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait– we’re dating now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If she had a tail, it would be wagging rapidly, a giant smile splitting her face in two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For now. But keep talking about other girls and we’ll see how long that lasts.” Agatha huffs, trying to sound mean but it is clear that there is no real threat in her words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help it, she drops her duffel bag and wraps her arms around Agatha in a giant bear hug, lifting the shorter girl into the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio– put me down! Rio!” Agatha squeals, unable to hide her joyful giggles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio finally lowers Agatha back down to the ground, leaving their faces inches apart. She looks down into Agatha’s eyes, feeling them soften beyond reason. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does that mean I can kiss you whenever I want now?” Rio whispers, looking serious for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha, taken aback by the sincerity in her voice, nods her head, bringing her hands up to grab onto Rio’s biceps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leans in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s. It is soft and gentle, and different from anything they have done thus far. Warmth blooms all over her body at the contact, making her feel like they are standing in the sun on a warm summer’s day, instead of in the middle of the street near the ocean at 11pm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulls back and looks into Agatha’s eyes, “You should be preparing yourself for a lot more of those then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smile feels permanently stuck to her face, she couldn’t stop if she tried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face breaks out into her own dopey smile, before she catches herself and clears her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I certainly won’t stop you,” she says as she turns to start walking again, waving a hand in the air dismissing the sentiment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good to know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabs onto Agatha’s hand just before she is out of reach, dragging her back into another kiss. This one more passionate than the last, both of them unable to tamp down their smiles, as their mouths connect over and over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio decides that she wants to do nothing but kiss Agatha for the rest of her life.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After one last soft peck, they pull back apart, turning to head back to the rental house in a comfortable silence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wordlessly uses her free hand to grab onto Agatha’s, holding it the rest of the way back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they enter through the front door, they take in the state of the living room. Popcorn and leftover pizzas scattered everywhere, most of the girls passed out at around the halfway point of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Imagine Me and You.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two girls can’t help but giggle, forgetting that their friends were even here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the sound, Alice lazily lifts her head. Her eyes go wide as she takes in their disheveled states.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Where the fuck have you two been?”</span>
  </em>
