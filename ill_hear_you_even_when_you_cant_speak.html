<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The bar was loud in the way that makes her teeth buzz—a steady, thrumming pulse of bass beneath overlapping conversations, glasses clinking, laughter spilling high and loud from the next booth. The air smelled like wine and someone’s spilled vodka soda. The kind of place where people either shouted to be heard or spoke too close, lips brushing ears intimately.</p><p>Rio stood just inside the entrance of The Witches Road, her eyes squinting against the purplish lighting that flickered like a headache waiting to happen. She hadn’t wanted to come. She hated the way bars overloaded her senses—sticky floors, chaotic music, faces moving too fast. But she’d said yes days ago, when it had felt like a good idea. Before she knew that there would be someone new joining them.</p><p>She scanned the room, searching out familiar shapes, her body tensing the way it always did when she knew she was about to have to mask and perform Normal.</p><p>There they were—tucked into the corner booth, squeezed tight like a pack of sardines who had also pre-gamed heavily.</p><p>Billy was already halfway through a pint, gesturing wildly like he was narrating a tale. Alice leaned into her new girlfriend Jen, eyeliner smudged into a smoky blur. Lilia, always mid-toast, glass raised and laughter spilling out in bursts.</p><p>And then her. The new person that had thrown off her usual routine.<br/>
Agatha.</p><p>Jen’s friend. The one Alice had casually mentioned would be there, she’d gone on to say something else about the woman but Rio had tuned her out. Too busy filing her away under potential threat.</p><p>She was seated at the end of the booth, a glass of something pale and fizzy cupped in one hand. Her face was composed, her features so sharp it was like someone had sculpted her. Sleek chocolate  hair hung in curls down her back, a fancy jacket tailored within an inch of its life, skin lit coolly under the bar’s violet glow.</p><p>Her hands, Rio noticed, were unmoving, except for the way one thumb rubbed a slow, repetitive circle on the glass. A tic, maybe. Or a tell.</p><p>As Rio approached, Agatha’s gaze flicked toward her—icy eyes catching hers. A momentary lock. Intense. Unreadable.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, stupidly. Her heart gave one loud, traitorous knock. No. Nope. Not that. She squared her shoulders against the reaction. That kind of beautiful had never meant anything good in her life. It was the kind that knew it, that used it. The kind that made eye contact with you just to watch you flinch.</p><p>“Rio!” Billy bellowed, nearly toppling over his chair in an effort to reach her. “Finally!”</p><p>“I was on time,” Rio muttered deadpan, squeezing into the narrow booth seat beside Agatha. The vinyl stuck unpleasantly to the backs of her thighs. “You’re just drunk.”</p><p>“Guilty,” Billy said, raising his glass like a confession. “But it’s fun!”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Rio, you’ve met Jen, right?”</p><p>“Once, yeah.”</p><p>Alice gestured toward the woman at the end of the booth. “And that’s Agatha. Jen’s friend.”</p><p>“I remember.” Rio turned toward Agatha, managing a nod. “Hi, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. Her mouth curled into something polite. She nodded towards her, smile warming her face as she looked at Rio.</p><p>But she didn’t speak.</p><p>Rio waited. Two seconds. Three. She tilted her head. The silence stretched, unbroken.</p><p>The others were already slipping back into their own conversations. Lilia was laughing about something. Someone had ordered fries. Jen was saying something about a horror movie premiere.<br/>
But here, on the edge of the booth, Rio sat suspended.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “So…you’re just gonna pretend you didn’t hear me say hello?”</p><p>Agatha turned slightly, enough to face her more directly. Her mouth opened. Then closed. Her eyes darted briefly to the table, then back up.<br/>
She opened her mouth again—lips shaping something, soundlessly.</p><p>Rio blinked, trying to follow. “Are you seriously… not answering me? Is this, like, a thing you do?”<br/>
There was no shift in her expression, just a flicker of something—confusion? Anger? This woman was not following the steps that politeness demanded.</p><p>Agatha raised a hand like she might gesture something—but then seemed to think better of it. She lowered it again. Her nails were short, almond shaped with a french tip. Her fingers trembled faintly. A faint pink line peeked out from beneath the sleeve of her jacket, barely noticeable. A healed burn, maybe. Or surgical scarring.</p><p>Rio felt the tight knot of irritation start to form in her chest. Her brain didn’t like ambiguity. She’d done her part—she’d greeted her, she’d been civil. There was a script for this sort of thing. When someone doesn’t follow the script, it meant something. It meant they were being rude, or dismissive, or worse—mocking you.</p><p>“You’re just sitting there,” she said, quieter now, under the buzz of the music, too low for the others to hear. “Looking at me like that’s enough. Like I’m supposed to what? Feel honoured that you glanced in my direction?”</p><p>Agatha’s face twitched with something—something Rio didn’t know how to name. She opened her mouth a third time. Her throat moved, a dry sound escaping—almost like a breath caught on a word that never formed.</p><p>Rio’s stomach tightened.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she snapped, voice still soft but sharp-edged now. “Don’t pretend now that you’re shy. That would be so—” she made a noise of frustrated disbelief, “—pathetic.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. Her cheeks flushed, not with embarrassment, but something else. Panic, maybe. Her hand gripped the edge of her glass so hard her knuckles whitened.</p><p>Something isn’t right, a quieter part of Rio’s brain noted. But the louder part—the one that remembered high school, and college, and all the times girls like this had stared through her like static—kept talking.</p><p>“You think you can just sit there, because you’re pretty, and no one will call you out for being rude? That only works if your actually able to pull it off. Otherwise…” She shook her head. “You just look broken. Or stupid.”</p><p>The flinch that followed was immediate and sharp, a crack in the other womans marble like face. Agatha jerked back a half inch, eyes wide, like Rio had hit her without lifting a hand.</p><p>A loud crash from the other end of the booth broke the moment. Billy had dropped his glass, and suddenly everyone was moving again—voices rising, the server hurrying over with napkins, someone laughing too hard, too loud.</p><p>But in the corner, Rio sat frozen.</p><p>The heat in her chest wasn’t pride. It wasn’t victory.</p><p>It was acid.</p><p>Agatha said nothing. Didn’t try again. Just folded her hands in her lap—tightly, like they might shake apart otherwise—and stared down at the drink she hadn’t touched.</p><p>The music shifted. The lyrics blurred into the ambient noise, but the tension  clung to the corners of the booth.</p><p>Rio looked away. Her jaw ached from clenching.<br/>
She didn’t know what she’d wanted from Agatha.<br/>
Maybe a witty comeback. Maybe a fight.</p><p>But whatever it was, it had curdled the moment it didn’t happen.</p><p>And now it sat between them, heavy and awful.</p><p>Rio swallowed against the burn in her throat. It had nothing to do with the whiskey she hadn’t even ordered. Gone were the days where she’d let hot women make fun of her for the way she was born.</p><p>——————————————————————————————</p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled beneath the table.<br/>
She kept them there, hidden in the shadows where the others wouldn’t see the way her fingers quivered, too tight and too raw. Her glass—still mostly full—sat untouched in front of her, the fizz long gone. A ring of condensation bled steadily onto the table beneath it, its edge trembling in time with her barely controlled breathing.</p><p>She didn’t look up. Not at the others laughing, not at Jen pressed into Alice’s side, her girlfriend’s eyeliner smudged from kissing or laughing or both.</p><p>Not at Rio, whose voice still rang in Agatha’s skull like the tail end of a slap.</p><p>The words hadn't even been loud. That’s what made them worse. Cruel, but quiet. Whispered. Like Rio didn’t even need volume to cut her down.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw until it ached.</p><p>She kept her face composed, posture still. But inside, everything was lurching.</p><p>A curl of hair had come loose from behind her ear. She pushed it back, fingers brushing the thin, pale scar near her temple that ran along the curve of her skull—barely noticeable unless you knew what to look for, unless the light caught it wrong. One of many. The rest were hidden beneath sleeves, beneath layers. A stitched history of the night it all cracked open.</p><p>The music thumped on. Billy was halfway through an elaborate retelling of a karaoke incident involving a bottle of Fireball and a broken ankle. The others laughed. Someone snorted. Someone spilled a drink.</p><p>No one noticed the way Agatha was slowly unraveling.</p><p>She ducked her head and pulled out her phone beneath the table, screen light casting her features in a cold, artificial blue.</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>
Hey. I’m gonna head out. Not feeling great. Can you let them know? xxx</p><p>She sent it with aching fingers. Even typing felt clumsy now as her anxiety heightened.</p><p>Across the booth, she watched Jen glance at her phone. Her brow furrowed in concern. She looked up, already leaning forward to ask something—but Agatha met her gaze and shook her head subtly. She forced a smile. Small. Reassuring.</p><p>Jen didn’t push. She never did. That was why Agatha liked her. Loved her, maybe, in the quiet kind of way that didn’t need to be said.</p><p>Jen just nodded, and under the table, reached for her hand and gave it a brief, gentle squeeze.</p><p>Agatha held on to that like it was air.</p><p>Then she stood, slow and careful, testing that her legs weren’t going to wobble before fully committing to the movement. She gathered her bag without fanfare, chucking a fifty bill onto the table to cover her drink and a decent tip.</p><p>Still, no one really noticed. They were too wrapped up in each other, in the warm, sticky joy of being drunk and with their closest friends, friends who had all welcomed Agatha with open arms. It should have made her feel safe. Instead, it made her feel like a ghost.</p><p>She moved around the booth quietly, mouthing soft goodbyes. Lilia was the first to notice.</p><p>“Leaving already?” she asked, standing to hug her. “You sure? We haven’t even started the bad singing yet.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, arms folding around her gently. Lilia smelled like jasmine and beer. Her hugs were always full-bodied, warm. Agatha appreciated the softness of it, even if she couldn’t quite lean in all the way.</p><p>Then Billy stood. “Aww, c’mon, Ags! It’s just about to start getting weird!” He pulled her into a lopsided hug, laughing against her shoulder.<br/>
“You’re gonna miss me butchering Bohemian Rhapsody.”</p><p>She smiled, thin but real. Let herself be held. She didn’t have the energy to correct the nickname. Not tonight.</p><p>Alice hugged her too, murmured something sweet and slightly slurred into her cheek—something about how it was nice to see her again, and they should catch up properly soon. Agatha nodded, grateful for the affection but too tired to promise anything back.</p><p>And then she turned—and there was Rio.</p><p>Still seated. Arms crossed, shoulders squared, jaw clenched like she was bracing for a fight that hadn’t come. Her gaze was sharp, confused.<br/>
As if she didn’t understand why Agatha was leaving but found relief that she was.</p><p>As if she thought she’d won something.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her directly. Couldn’t. She gave a faint nod, just enough to be polite, to acknowledge the existence of a person who had made her feel like she was there again, back in that hospital room, struggling to remember anything.</p><p>And then she stepped past her.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. But Agatha felt her eyes on her back the entire way to the door.</p><p>Outside, the air slapped her skin cold. She didn’t bother zipping her jacket, just shoved her hands into her pockets and walked.</p><p>She didn’t cry until the next block.</p><p>Even then, it wasn’t dramatic. Just a few hot, tears leaking down her cheeks as she pressed the back of her hand to her mouth and kept going. Fast. Determined. She didn’t want anyone to see. Didn’t want anyone to know that one girl’s quiet cruelty had undone her like this.</p><p>She had come so far.</p><p>Speech therapy. Months of relearning how to even make sound, how to breathe around the structure of a word. How to feel okay stumbling over even a simple hello in front of strangers. Her accident had left her with a brain injury that snarled her language processing, tangled it like thread too fine to grasp. The damage was catastrophic. Exhausting. Most people noticed but gave her space, unless they were impatient. Or unkind.</p><p>Rio had been both.</p><p>And it stung worse because—god, she was Agatha’s type.</p><p>That sharp jaw. Those intense eyes. That messy kind of presence, like she wasn’t trying to be magnetic, she just was. Jen had said it offhandedly the week before, while scrolling through her texts.</p><p>“You’ll like Rio,” she’d said, grin lazy. “She’s kinda feral. Different. But in a hot way. Definitely your type.”</p><p>Agatha had laughed. She’d even worn her favorite jacket tonight, the one that made her feel powerful. Polished. Whole.</p><p>She should’ve known better. Jen hadn’t told her the other part, that Rio was cruel. That Rio would take one look at her struggling to commute her brain to her mouth and think it was weakness.</p><p>That thought burned. Shame and fury mixing hot in her chest.</p><p>Agatha wiped her cheeks with the sleeve of her jacket and forced herself to keep walking.</p><p>She’d worked too hard to be treated like a broken thing.</p><p>Too hard to be mocked.</p><p>She didn’t text Jen. And she wouldn’t. Jen had looked so happy—Alice’s arm around her, that tipsy grin pulling at her mouth. Agatha didn’t want to crack that. Didn’t want to be the reason the night soured.</p><p>She would go home, she told herself. She would cry in the safety of her own home where no one was around to judge her. She would take off the jacket and wash her face and maybe, eventually, she would sleep.</p><p>But Rio’s words, quiet, precise, surgical, would haunt her sleep.</p>

<p>Back inside the bar, Rio sat stiffly, arms crossed too tight across her chest, her spine straight and pressed to the back of the booth. She stared at the door, unblinking. Watched it swing shut behind Agatha with a soft hiss. Watched like maybe Agatha would come back. But the door stayed closed.</p><p>“She just left,” Rio muttered, the words almost to herself.</p><p>Alice looked up from her drink. “Who?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. Her tone was clipped, sharp without meaning to be.</p><p>Jen, across from her, stopped tracing the rim of her glass. Her posture stilled. “She wasn’t feeling great,” Jen said. Quiet. Careful.</p><p>Rio shifted. “She didn’t say anything, not even goodbye.”</p><p>“She tried,” Jen replied, tone a little more direct now. “You just might not have seen it.”</p><p>A pause stretched out between them. The music thumped overhead. Somewhere near the bar, someone dropped a shot glass and whooped like it was hilarious. A chorus of laughter followed.<br/>But the air around their table had gone quieter. Thicker.</p><p>Lilia glanced over. “I know you said she’s been working really hard,” she said, voice low. “Just being here tonight took effort.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Effort?”</p><p>Jen looked up. Her eyes were sharp now—not angry, but alert, like she was ready to shield something fragile if she had to. “Didn’t Alice tell you?” Jen asked.</p><p>“She said… she mentioned something when she told me she’d be here tonight,” Rio said. Her throat felt tight. “I didn’t really—” She stopped herself. Swallowed the rest. Didn’t really listen. Didn’t really think it mattered.</p><p>“She had a car accident,” Jen said, turning her glass slowly between her palms. “Eight months ago. A drunk driver hit her at an intersection blowing through a red light.“</p><p>There was a silence at the table. Real this time. No one interrupted.</p><p>“The car flipped,” Jen continued. “Twice. Crushed her in on the driver’s side. She was unconscious when they pulled her out. Woke up ten days later.”</p><p>Billy let out a slow breath, low under his breath. Even Lilia looked away, as though the weight of it needed space.</p><p>“She had multiple broken bones but thats all healed. The main thing was she couldn’t talk when she woke up,” Jen said. Her voice dropped a little. “Not even basic stuff. She could think. She could understand. But the part of her brain that lets words out—”</p><p>“Was damaged?” Lilia finished, gently.</p><p>Jen nodded. “Traumatic brain injury. It’s not always visible. People don’t get it because she can still walk and write and laugh at jokes, but… speech is different. It’s more fragile than people think.”</p><p>“She can write, though?” Rio asked quietly. She hated how dumb the question sounded the second it left her mouth.</p><p>“Yeah. And read. And she knows what she wants to say. That’s the cruel part.” Jen’s voice had turned gentle again, but there was an edge under it. “The thoughts are still in there. The sentences are perfect. But when she goes to speak, they fall apart somewhere between her brain and her mouth.”</p><p>Rio said nothing. She felt the beginning of something rising in her chest—a knot of guilt, or something shaped like it.</p><p>“She’s been in therapy ever since,” Jen said. “Speech therapy. Occupational. Cognitive. She practices every day. She’s stubborn like that.”</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. “She’d have to be.”</p><p>“Some days are good. She can get a few words out,” Jen said. “Other days…” Her voice faltered. “It’s like trying to force a sentence through a wall.”</p><p>Rio stayed silent. She remembered Agatha’s face tonight—how she’d turned toward her, opened her mouth. That flicker of something behind her eyes. The tension in her jaw.</p><p>And Rio had read it all wrong.</p><p>Had decided it meant something else. Something easier to accept.</p><p>Alice’s voice broke gently into the stillness. “She wanted to come tonight. Even though crowds are hard. Noise is hard. Talking in a group is hard. She still wanted to try.”</p><p>“She was excited to meet you,” Jen added, gesturing towards Rio.</p><p>Rio looked up, startled. “What?”</p><p>“I told her you were smart,” Jen said, with a small shrug. “And funny. The kind of person who doesn’t waste time with small talk.”</p><p>Rio blinked at that. Her mouth was dry.</p><p>“She even wore that stupidly expensive jacket,” Jen went on. “The one she puts on when she needs to feel brave.”</p><p>Rio remembered it now—sleek, deep navy. Tailored to perfection. The kind of thing that made someone look composed, powerful. But Agatha hadn’t looked powerful. Not when you looked closely. She’d looked… tense. Like every breath cost something.</p><p>“She’s not cold,” Jen said, as if reading Rio’s thoughts. “She’s not uninterested. And she’s not rude.”</p><p>Her gaze sharpened. Protective again.</p><p>“She just doesn’t owe anyone an explanation the moment they want one. Especially not in a bar full of noise and strangers. Especially not when she’s barely holding it together.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened around her glass. The condensation had soaked through the napkin beneath it, dampening her skin.</p><p>She didn’t speak. Because if she did, she might have to explain why she hadn’t given Agatha a second chance to try. Why she’d decided what the silence meant without even asking herself if it might mean something else.</p><p>“She’s not broken,” Jen said. “She’s just… carrying something you can’t see.”</p><p>And Rio knew better than most what that was like.</p><p>She thought of the checklist in her head that never stopped running. The invisible rulebook she needed to make sense of other people. The way unfamiliar expressions tied her brain in knots. How much easier it was to assume the worst than to deal with ambiguity.</p><p>Alice had warned her. Gently, over the phone that morning  “Sometimes Agatha takes a while to speak. Don’t worry if she seems quiet.” And Rio had nodded like she understood, brushing it off. She didn’t have time for vague social puzzles. If someone wanted to talk, they would. If they didn’t—why pretend?</p><p>But it hadn’t been pretend.</p><p>And now, sitting in the booth, the music pounding above her and the others starting to talk again like the tension had broken, Rio felt it sit like a stone in her stomach.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to hurt anyone.</p><p>But she had.</p><p>And no one even knew.</p><p>Except her.</p><p>The conversation around the booth had started up again, low and easy. Billy said something half-funny about the bartender’s ponytail, and Alice gave a soft laugh that didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t in it.</p><p>She sat in silence, still staring at the place Agatha had been. The shape her absence left behind was louder than the music now.</p><p>Every few seconds, a memory rewound and played itself again: Agatha’s parted lips. That slight tremble in her jaw. The look in her eyes—wide, too bright.</p><p>And Rio’s mind wouldn’t stop parsing it. Looping it. Trying to re-interpret what she’d dismissed.<br/>She wasn’t smug. She was stuck.</p><p>Lilia’s voice brought her back. “What kind of work does Agatha do again?”</p><p>“She owns and runs a publishing company,” Jen said, tone neutral but proud.</p><p>That made the whole table blink. “Wait, she owns it?” Billy asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yup,” Jen said. “Started it herself a years and  years ago. Small imprint at first. It’s grown even more since the accident, actually.”</p><p>Rio frowned, her voice slipping out before she had time to filter it. “How can she run a company if she can’t talk?”</p><p>The silence came fast. Tight. Jen’s gaze snapped to Rio, sharp and glittering—but it wasn’t cruel. It was the kind of look people gave when they were deciding whether to explain something or walk away.</p><p>Lilia cleared her throat, giving Jen space.</p><p>“She can write,” Jen said finally. “Emails. Memos. She manages staff through text and documents. She’s really precise.”</p><p>“You told me she’s always been a control freak when it comes to work,” Alice added with a fond smile.</p><p>“But meetings?” Rio asked. “What does she do in a meeting?”</p><p>Jen exhaled slowly. “Depends. Sometimes she has someone else handle the speaking. Sometimes she prepares slides. Sometimes she types responses in real time. Depends on the day.”</p><p>Rio nodded, slowly. “So she’s… disabled.”</p><p>Jen’s shoulders tensed, and Alice gave her a quick look—checking in. “She has a disability, yes,” Jen said carefully.</p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched against the condensation of her glass. Her brain had latched onto a thought it couldn’t let go of. She needed to understand. Needed to see the whole system, or it wouldn’t compute.</p><p>“Does she get help with things?” she asked. “Like—does she live alone? Can she drive now? Is it permanent?”</p><p>Alice gave a soft wince.</p><p>Billy made a face like he wasn’t sure if he should derail the conversation.</p><p>Jen didn’t flinch. She just looked at Rio, and something in her eyes changed—not angry, but assessing. “Are you asking because you want to understand,” she said, “or because you’re building a profile?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I—don’t know. I just… want to get it right.”</p><p>There was a pause. Jen nodded, once.</p><p>“She lives alone,” she said. “Yes. She can drive but she doesn’t like to, but she’s working on it. We don’t know if it’s permanent. But that doesn’t mean she’s not still adapting. Doesn’t mean it won’t keep improving.”</p><p>“She’s one of the most competent people I know,” Lilia added, having met Jen and Agatha before introducing Alice. “Seriously. Her brain just… routes around the roadblocks.”</p><p>Rio sat with that. Turning it over.</p><p>“She didn’t look disabled,” she said, frowning. “I mean—I don’t mean that like it sounds.”</p><p>“I know what you meant,” Jen said, a little too quickly. “It’s just… you can’t see everything that matters.”</p><p>“I didn’t see anything,” Rio whispered. “Even when I looked right at her.”</p><p>Alice reached over and gave her wrist a light touch. “Most people wouldn’t. It’s not obvious. That’s part of why it’s so hard.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak again. Her brain was buzzing—thoughts tangling and colliding. She’d asked the wrong questions. Said the wrong things. And she didn’t even know which ones until after.</p><p>It wasn’t malice. She wasn’t cruel usually.</p><p>She was just… off. Again.</p><p>Her tone. Her timing. Her questions. Her assumptions.</p><p>She didn’t know how to ask about people without sounding like she was dissecting them. Didn’t know how to leave room for what she didn’t understand. And now Agatha had walked out into the night, misunderstood and unheard.</p><p>And Rio had let her. Had helped make her invisible.</p><p>Rio sat rigid in the booth, trying to stay still—but her fingers tapped the side of her glass in uneven beats. She didn’t notice. Her gaze was fixed on Jen now, as if the right answer might unlock something if she just asked the right combination of questions.</p><p>“So she runs a publishing company?” she said suddenly, cutting through the lull.</p><p>Jen glanced at her. “Yes, like I said, for years now. Why?”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “But… she can’t speak.”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“She can’t speak easily,” Jen corrected. “But that doesn’t mean she can’t communicate. Or manage people. Or run a business.”</p><p>“She looked at me like she wanted to say something,” Rio said. “But nothing came out.”</p><p>“She probably did try to say something,” Jen said, her voice firm. “It’s just that her speech is what got damaged. Not her thoughts. Not her intelligence.”</p><p>Rio was quiet for a beat, then said, “I didn’t mean to imply she wasn’t intelligent.”</p><p>“But you assumed,” Jen said, not unkindly.</p><p>Rio looked away. “I... yeah.”</p><p>“She’s actually brilliant,” Alice offered, more softly. “She has a master’s in comparative literature. Speaks French and Italian. Reads Latin.”</p><p>Billy whistled. “Alright brainbox Agatha, damn.”</p><p>“She’s always been sharp,” Jen said. “Scary sharp. The kind of person who finished your sentence in a way that makes you realize you didn’t know what you were about to say.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “But the way she sat there—”</p><p>“She was struggling with her output,” Jen interrupted gently. “That’s all. Her mind’s untouched. Just the connection between what she thinks and what her mouth can do.”</p><p>Lilia added, “She got hit hard. A full-side collision. The part of her brain that forms and initiates speech—that’s what took the trauma.”</p><p>“She sometimes gets tremors,” Jen added. “Mostly when she’s overtired or anxious. Or when she tries too hard to push through the speech block. Her nervous system kind of… rebels.”</p><p>“So she can talk, just not all the time?” she asked, voice low but intent.</p><p>Jen gave a slow nod. Her shoulders had drawn back, subtly braced. “Yes. Some days it’s easier. Some words come reliably. But stress, noise, fatigue—all of that makes it harder. It’s like her brain… scrambles the delivery system.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, processing. “So it’s not just language. It’s the conditions around her. The environment.”</p><p>“That’s part of it.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, quick. “Did the doctors give it a name?”</p><p>Jen hesitated. “Yes. But it’s complicated.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward slightly. “I’d like to know it.”</p><p>There was a pause. Alice gave Jen a glance—not quite warning, but cautious. Jen’s jaw worked, just once. Then: “She was diagnosed with aphasia. More specifically, expressive aphasia. Her comprehension’s intact, her writing too, but initiating speech is like trying to push through glue.”</p><p>Rio repeated the term under her breath. “Expressive aphasia.” She let the shape of the words settle on her tongue. “So it’s damage to the speech-output center?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But she can understand everything?”</p><p>Jen nodded.</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed. “That must be incredibly frustrating.”</p><p>“It is,” Jen said. “Painfully so.”</p><p>Lilia, watching from the side, interjected gently. “Rio, are you okay?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer the question. She was still focused. Still building the internal framework.</p><p>“Does she use AAC?” Rio asked next.</p><p>Jen blinked, surprised. “Sometimes. She’s tried apps, but they can feel clunky in conversation. She prefers typing short responses on her phone if she needs to explain something. But she doesn't always want to explain.”</p><p>“Because of shame?” Rio asked. “Or pride?”</p><p>“Because she doesn’t want to be reduced to a diagnosis,” Jen said, a little more firmly.</p><p>“I wasn’t reducing her,” Rio replied, brow creased. “I’m just trying to understand. If I know how her brain works, I won’t make the same mistake next time.”</p><p>There was a pause. Then, surprisingly, Jen softened. “That’s… fair.”</p><p>Rio nodded again. “She must plan around it constantly. Anticipate things. Scripts, maybe? Rehearsals?”</p><p>“She has some cards from speech therapy,” Jen said reluctantly. “Words she’s most likely to need to use. Sometimes she flips through them like flashcards before events so she can sound the words.”</p><p>Rio’s hands stilled.</p><p>The idea of that—someone rehearsing social interaction down to the syllable—landed somewhere deep and familiar in her chest.</p><p>“She writes alot more than she speaks,” Jen added. “She says writing feels like breathing, but speaking feels like swimming in mud.”</p><p>There was something in the way she said it—almost a direct quote.</p><p>Rio absorbed that in silence. The image played itself out in her head. Agatha, sat at a table. Flipping through cards. Practicing words. Alone.</p><p>“What else does she do?” Rio asked. “To cope. To adapt.”</p><p>Alice gave a quiet sound—half-sigh, half-warning. “Rio…”</p><p>“No, it’s okay,” Jen said, holding up a hand. Her eyes hadn’t left Rio’s. “She’s not being cruel. She’s… parsing.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Parsing what?”</p><p>“You’re trying to translate her,” Jen said gently. “Into something your brain understands.”</p><p>Rio went still. The silence that followed was sharp—not hostile, just raw. Then she nodded. Once. “Yes.”</p><p>And something in Jen’s expression shifted.</p><p>“She’s routine-based,” Jen offered now, her voice quieter. “Her days are structured. She wears her air-pods alot  when she’s out in public, even when they’re not playing music. Just to keep the sound world smaller.”</p><p>Rio felt her shoulders relax slightly. That made sense.</p><p>“She can’t stand overlapping conversations,” Jen continued. “Too much input and she freezes. Not physically, but—linguistically. She’s still there, just can’t reach the output.”</p><p>“Does she stim?” Rio asked suddenly.</p><p>“No. She sometimes gets tremors,” Jen said. “Mostly when she’s overtired or anxious. Or when she tries too hard to push through the speech block. Her nervous system kind of… rebels.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “So it’s not neurodivergence. It’s… injury.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Jen said.</p><p>“She’s not autistic?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “But the headphones. The planning. The note cards. The—”</p><p>“She uses tools,” Jen said. “That doesn’t make her neurodivergent. It makes her smart.”</p><p>Rio blinked. That hadn’t occurred to her. In her world, tools like that were a sign of wiring—neurotype. People like her needed supports to translate a world that never seemed to come with a manual.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t like her. She was just... working through a detour.</p><p>Jen leaned forward slightly. “She’s not stimming. She’s managing.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to her hands. “I thought she was like me.”</p><p>Jen paused, just a second too long.</p><p>“She’s not like you,” she said carefully. “But that doesn’t mean she’s above you. Or fragile. She’s just… different. In a different way.”</p><p>Rio processed that. Her mouth tightened.</p><p>“What’s her normal day like?” she asked next. “I want to understand what she faces. How she functions.”</p><p>Jen seemed to consider the question. Then: “Mornings are easier—less fatigue. She takes calls only when she knows she has the energy with people shes known for a long time. If she feels herself slipping, she cancels. No shame about it.”</p><p>“She communicates through writing in calls?”</p><p>“Yes. They do alot on teams and she uses the chat. When she needs to present, she builds out visual decks. She’s incredibly efficient.”</p><p>Rio nodded again. “So she’s adapted.”</p><p>“She’s adaptable,” Jen corrected. “There’s a difference.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, puzzled.</p><p>“Adapting is reacting,” Jen said. “Adaptable is being proactive. Agatha’s not surviving her injury—she’s outmanoeuvring it.”</p><p>“Do you need to ask this many questions?” Billy muttered, not unkindly, but with a raised brow.</p><p>Rio turned to him. “Yes. Otherwise the picture’s incomplete.”</p><p>Billy blinked. “Huh.”</p><p>Lilia smiled softly, but said nothing.</p><p>The table fell quiet again.</p><p>Rio felt the heat rising in her chest—not embarrassment. Something worse. Something raw and pulsing behind her ribs.</p><p>She’d written Agatha off the second she didn’t respond.</p><p>The group was settling again, the conversation moving away from Rios interrogation about Agatba. The worst of the silence had passed, but the air still carried a weight to it. Like something unsaid was pressing at the edges of the table.</p><p>Rio shifted forward, then back. Her hands had gone still, wrapped tight around her glass. Jen was halfway through a sip of her cocktail when Rio spoke again.</p><p>“I said something cruel to her,” she said, quietly. Flat.</p><p>Jen’s eyes flicked up.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have,” Rio added. “But I did.”</p><p>The table didn’t fall silent, because no one else was talking. But the stillness sharpened. Lilia paused mid-sip. Billy looked over.</p><p>Jen set her glass down, carefully. “What did you say?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw worked for a second before she could answer.</p><p>“I told her she looked stupid and pathetic.”</p><p>Jen blinked. Once. No dramatics. No gasping. Just a blink. It made it worse, somehow.</p><p>“I thought she was ignoring me,” Rio continued, voice lower now, almost mechanical. “I misread her silence. I thought it was intentional. I thought she was trying to make me feel small.”</p><p>The words came like numbers in a sequence. Ordered. Logical. She was trying to lay them out clean. “I felt... stupid,” she said. “Like I wasn’t worth the effort of a reply. And I reacted without checking the variables.”</p><p>Her voice cracked slightly on the last word. Jen didn’t speak. Not right away.</p><p>Rio looked down. “I didn’t know.”</p><p>“No,” Jen said, finally. “But Alice told you she had trouble speaking. You just didn’t listen.”</p><p>That landed like a punch. It was true. “I did listen to her,” Rio said. “I just didn’t register it. I thought it meant she was quiet. Not—this.”</p><p>Jen’s shoulders rose, then slowly lowered. She folded her arms across her chest. “You saw a gap, and instead of waiting, you filled it with your own assumptions.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“She tried,” Jen said. “She opened her mouth and tried.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said softly. “I know that now.”</p><p>She saw it in vivid detail—Agatha’s mouth parted, her brow tight with strain. That desperate glint of effort behind her eyes. And Rio, mistaking the pause for superiority. For dismissal.</p><p>Jen rubbed a hand over her face. “Jesus.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to humiliate her,” Rio added, quickly. “I just... I didn't realize what I was doing.”</p><p>“That’s not enough,” Jen said. “Not meaning to doesn’t undo the impact.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Silence again. Alice reached forward and set her hand on the table, near Jen’s. Not touching. Just there. Lilia leaned back, watching Rio carefully.</p><p>“Is this why you’ve been asking so much?” Lilia said quietly. “Because you needed to know what you missed?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I need the whole picture before I can act. That’s how I process.”</p><p>Jen studied her now. Her tone had shifted—still protective, but less sharp. “Then tell me this: are you asking all these questions so you can apologize better? Or so you can feel better?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She stared down at the grooves in the tabletop, as if hoping they’d arrange themselves into meaning. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Maybe both.”</p><p>Jen sighed through her nose. “At least that’s honest.”</p><p>“I want to fix it,” Rio added.</p><p>“Then don’t rush to fix it for you,” Jen said. “You don’t get to do damage control and walk away clean.”</p><p>Rio swallowed.</p><p>“She’ll be okay,” Jen said, quieter now. “She’s used to people making assumptions when she doesn’t speak quickly enough. She’s had strangers talk over her. Waiters walk away before she can order. Even clients have cut meetings short, thinking she’s confused or incapable.”</p><p>“She’s not incapable,” Rio said instantly.</p><p>“I know that. She knows that. But people make decisions fast. And your voice, or lack of one, defines how you’re treated. Whether you like it or not.”</p><p>Rio looked up. Her voice, when it came, was small. “She’ll never want to speak to me again, will she.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jen said honestly. “She might not. That’s her choice.”</p><p>“I don’t expect forgiveness,” Rio said. “But I want to apologise.”</p><p>Jen was quiet for a long time. “Next time we hang out, you can try.. I’m gonna check she got home safe”</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>Did you make it home? Xxx</p><p>Jen’s phone buzzed once. Then again.</p><p>Rio had barely blinked in ten minutes. Her fingers were locked together in her lap now, still and white-knuckled, her foot tapping out an erratic rhythm under the table. Jen unlocked her phone. Rio’s eyes immediately flicked toward the screen.</p><p>[Agatha → Jen] Yep, I’m home. Thanks for checking in xxx</p><p>Jen’s thumbs hovered.</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>You okay? Xxx</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>Okay-adjacent. Don’t worry xxx</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>I’m always going to worry. Was it horrible? Xxx</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>Not your fault. Don’t carry it xxx</p><p>Rio leaned forward slightly. “Did she say that to make you feel better or because she means it?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Jen didn’t answer. She angled her phone away. Rio kept leaning.</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>Did Rio say anything to you? Before you left? Xxx</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>No. You know how it gets when I’m tired. Too much sound, too many eyes, I couldn’t get any words out xxx</p><p>Jen exhaled slowly, upset that her best friend didn’t want to tell her what had happened. Her fingers moved again.</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>I hate that you feel like you have to act normal for them xxx</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>I wasn’t trying to act normal. Just… trying not to seem broken xxx</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “She wrote that?” she asked, eyes trained on the screen again. “She thinks she’s broken?”</p><p>Jen turned, frowning. “Rio.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to read it,” Rio said, too fast. “But I’m sitting right here. I can’t not read. It’s a proximity thing.”</p><p>“You could look away.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped instantly, like a guilty child. “I didn’t want to miss anything important. If I miss part of it, the context doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>Jen’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“I process things in threads,” Rio added. “You started this thread with me, but now you’re continuing it without me, so I’m stuck in the middle.”</p><p>“It’s not your thread,” Jen said sharply. “It’s mine. And hers.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio mumbled, picking at the seam of her jacket sleeve. “But she said she feels broken. That’s significant, isn’t it?”</p><p>“It’s private,” Jen snapped. “You don’t get to comb through a private message for data on her.”</p><p>Rio flinched. “I’m not combing. I just… need to understand. I made the mistake because I misunderstood her.”</p><p>“You made the mistake because you were cruel.”</p><p>Rio looked up, stunned. “I didn’t mean to be.”</p><p>“I know you didn’t. But she doesn’t know that. And reading over my shoulder isn’t going to fix it.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth. Closed it. She stared down at her hands.</p><p>A new buzz. Another message.</p><p>[Agatha → Jen] I couldn’t get the first word out. Then I felt it coming—the tremor. My hands were shaking bad. I didn’t want anyone to see that xxx</p><p>Jen’s face crumpled slightly. Another message popped through.</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>It made me feel like I’m malfunctioning xxx</p><p>[Jen → Agatha]<br/>You’re not malfunctioning. You’re surviving, your doing amazing xxx</p><p>[Agatha → Jen]<br/>I should’ve stayed home. I knew I was pushing it. She looked at me like I was stupid xxx</p><p>Rio drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>Jen turned slowly, meeting her eyes. “Out,” she said flatly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Out of the conversation. Out of my personal space. Now.”</p><p>“I wasn’t—”</p><p>“You were.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to stop watching things,” Rio said, voice cracking. “Especially when it’s important.”</p><p>Jen’s voice dropped, lower and firmer. “Then you learn.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched. Not quite a frown. Not quite tears. Just confusion. “Is she mad at me?” she asked, so small it was barely audible.</p><p>Jen sighed. “She’s hurt. That’s not the same.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, the motion almost mechanical. “I want to start again with her.”</p><p>Jen looked at her, some of the fire fading into something cooler, tired. “She might’ve let you, if you’d let her exist first.”</p>

<p>Jen let herself in to Agathas apartment quietly, both having pretty much an open door policy to one another’s homes.</p><p>The apartment was dim, lit only by a low lamp near the window and the late-afternoon gloom pressing against the glass. The air smelled faintly of bergamot and dried lavender. Safe, usually.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Agatha was curled in the corner of the couch, laptop propped on her knee, working her way through a new manuscript, wrapped in a thick blanket.</p><p>Her eyes flicked up briefly as Jen stepped inside, then back down.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>Jen hesitated, hovering by the door. “I brought you tea.” She set it gently on the table. “From that place near your physio. The one with the cinnamon oat milk you like.”</p><p>“Thank you… didn’t….have to.” A bright grin met her, open, trusting.</p><p>Jen sat on the edge of the armchair across from her. She rested her elbows on her knees and twisted her fingers together.</p><p>“I need to talk to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s attention snapped to her, the tone catching her attention immediately.</p><p>Jen swallowed. “It’s about last night. After you left.”</p><p>Silence. The tension in the room twisted tighter.<br/>“She, Rio, was upset. She thought you were ignoring her. I got mad. I told her… I told her about the accident.”</p><p>Agatha looked up slowly.</p><p>Jen felt her voice catch. “Not everything. But I said way too much. I was drunk. I told her about the brain injury. That you… struggle. With speech. When you’re tired. When things are overwhelming.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t blink for several seconds. Then, very quietly, she shifted. Pulled her phone out from under the blanket, recognising that she was going to need it to fully voice her response.</p><p>“That’s not… okay.”</p><p>Jen nodded, guilt crackling in her chest. “I didn’t mean to. I wasn’t thinking clearly. We’d all been drinking, and she said she’d been cruel to you, and I wanted to protect you.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth moved like she might speak, but the words didn’t come. Her lips parted. Closed again.</p><p>Her fingers moved across the screen on her notes app.</p><p>[You don’t protect me like that.]</p><p>Jen’s breath caught. “I know. I know that now.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away this time. Her eyes were shining, but it wasn’t soft. It wasn’t sadness, not really. It was betrayal. It was hurt.</p><p>“I just thought… if she knew what you’d been through, she’d understand.”</p><p>Another pause. Then:<br/>[So you explained me.]</p><p>Jen winced. “Agatha-”</p><p>[Like a problem. Like I can’t speak for myself, so you did it for me.]</p><p>Jen stood and stepped closer. “I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Agatha set the phone down. Looked up. Her mouth worked again.</p><p>“Mine,” she rasped. Barely more than breath, but full of steel. “It’s mine… to tell.”</p><p>Jen felt something rupture in her chest.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I should’ve waited. Asked. I should have let you decide what to share.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Her hands were clenched in the blanket now, her whole body coiled.</p><p>“I didn’t think about how exposed that would feel for you. I just reacted. I thought telling the truth would fix something.”</p><p>Agatha picked up the phone again. She typed slower now, as though her hands hurt.</p><p>[Truth doesn’t fix trust.]</p><p>Jen sat down again. She rubbed her hands over her face. “You’re right.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, expression unreadable.</p><p>Then:<br/>[You didn’t ask. You didn’t even pause to think whether I wanted some random women that I’d only just met, who was a bitch, to know anything about me.]</p><p>“I didn’t,” Jen whispered. “I didn’t even stop to think about how brave it is for you to come out with us. To try. You’ve worked so hard, and I just, put all of that out there without asking if you wanted it known.”</p><p>Agatha turned the phone toward her one last time.</p><p>[You told my story like it was fucking gossip Jen! I’d never do that to you. I don’t want to talk to you right now.]</p><p>Jen blinked back tears.<br/>“I’m sorry, Agatha, I’m really sorry. I hate that I made you feel that way.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, the tension in her jaw visible. She pulled the blanket tighter, breath catching.</p><p>Jen reached out, barely brushing her fingers against Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I want to fix this. Not just apologise. I’ll do anything, wait, listen, whatever you need.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away. But she didn’t nod either.</p><p>She just typed:<br/>[Then leave. Please. Just leave me alone for now.]</p><p>Jen stood.She walked to the door in silence. Just before she stepped out, she turned. “You’re my best friend, Agatha. I love you, you know.”</p><p>The door clicked shut behind Jen. Agatha sat motionless for a long time, barely breathing, the weight of the silence a living thing pressing against her chest. The blanket still draped over her shoulders, but it didn’t feel like comfort anymore, it felt like armor, fraying at the edges.<br/>She reached for her phone, typed nothing, deleted drafts before they formed. There wasn’t a message that made sense, not for Jen, not for anyone.</p><p>She stared at the tea on the table. Cinnamon oat milk. Warm, sweet. Kind.</p><p>Like a bribe.</p><p>She hadn’t even tasted it.</p><p>She hated how her fingers trembled.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Jen had told her story. It was that she hadn’t hesitated. Hadn’t paused. Hadn’t thought about how many months Agatha had spent trying to find her way back into conversations in her own again.</p><p>About how she’d stood in front of mirrors, forcing vowels through stiff jaws, trying to sound like herself, even though she couldn’t get a few words out without long pauses and stammers.</p><p>She had trusted Jen with every part of her. Every clumsy syllable, every shutdown moment, every shaking first. And Jen, who loved her, who knew better, had still opened that door wide enough for someone like Rio to waltz in and see her as weak. As a sob story.</p><p>And that was the worst part.</p><p>Jen knew how people could be.</p><p>And still.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the couch cushion.</p><p>She wanted to rage. But she couldn't, not just because she was alone. Her voice didn’t work like that anymore. She’d lose the word halfway, stumble over breath and muscle, and it would come out half-formed and ugly, and she'd feel worse than she did now. And she already felt like a wound.</p><p>Like she’d been cracked open and left to stew in someone else's pity and someone else's cruelty, like she was furniture they moved around with apologies.</p><p>She thought of Rio.</p><p>That cutting stare. That mocking tone. Are you just going to sit there? Pathetic.</p><p>She hadn’t even had chance to introduce herself. And still she'd taken one look and decided Agatha didn’t deserve basic kindness.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek hard enough to taste blood.</p><p>There had been a moment, back at the bar, just one, when she’d been tempted. When Rio had walked in and looked like something out of a fantasy. She’d looked vivid and hard-edged and alive in the way that made Agatha feel like she might tip forward if she stared too long.</p><p>Jen had said she’d be her type. She wasn’t wrong.<br/>But she’d also said that she was smart. Honest. Real.</p><p>Agatha had believed her.</p><p>But Rio’s honesty had come sharpened. And her realness had arrived like a slap. As if Agatha’s silence meant nothing. As if her effort wasn’t visible. As if her body, her being, still rebuilding itself after months, was something to mock.</p><p>She wasn’t just angry. She was ashamed that she had cared what Rio thought at all. That she’d been weak enough at the thought of kindness to actually be hurt.</p><p>She opened the Notes app. A private space. She wrote something her therapist had talked her through, something to ground her when her voice failed :<br/>I am not what happened to me. I am not what someone else explains. I am not a story to be told. I am still here. Even if I speak slow. Even if you talk faster than I can follow. I am still here.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>She wasn’t ready to forgive Jen. And she sure as hell wasn’t ready to face Rio. But she could start with this: being angry. On her own terms. In her own voice.</p><p>Even if it was typed.</p><p>Even if it was slow.</p><p>Two days later, a text from Lilia popped up.</p><p>[Lilia → Agatha]<br/>Hey. I hope this isn’t too much But a few of us are doing brunch on Sunday. Just casual. I’d love for you to come. Totally your call.</p><p>Agatha stared at it, thumb hovering. Brunch. Code for: let’s pretend we’re normal, over eggs and overpriced coffee.</p><p>She didn’t answer. Not right away.</p><p>Two hours later, another message.</p><p>[Lilia → Agatha]<br/>I just want to say… I know what happened. And I’m really sorry. Rio was drunk. And anxious. She lashes out when she’s scared. Not that it’s an excuse. Just context. She’s not usually like that.</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave a strange twist.</p><p>Not usually. Just this time, with you.</p><p>She sat in silence for a while, legs curled under her, the same blanket around her shoulders. She traced the faint scar near her right temple with one thumb - the little ridge of it like punctuation on her skin. A reminder of how fragile everything could be, how fast it could all change.</p><p>She hadn’t told Lilia yes.</p><p>But she hadn’t said no either. She needed to make up with Jen before moving back into ‘Jen’s friends’ space.</p><p>The brunch spot was louder than Rio had expected, too many glass walls, too much metal and tile. Every clink of cutlery, every scrape of a chair, bounced and ricocheted through the open space. It made her shoulders inch up without meaning to, her fingers curl tight under the edge of the counter as she waited for her coffee.</p><p>The others were already there when she walked in. Billy waved her over with his usual too-loud cheer. Jen and Alice were curled into each other, all soft smiles and tangled hands. Lilia gave her a smile and shifted to make space.</p><p>And then-Agatha. Agatha was here.</p><p>She sat in between Billy and Lilia this time. She wore a soft gray jumper that looked worn-in at the cuffs, pulled over the majority if her hands, her hair was wondrously curly in a bun with loose curls framing her face, Rio had the sudden urge to touch the strands and see if they were as soft as they looked. Her hands sat folded on the table, knuckles pink from the cold. Her lips were painted a blush pink, and just near her temple, in the natural light from the windows, a pale scar caught the light-so faint you might miss it unless you were looking too hard.</p><p>Rio was looking too hard.</p><p>Every detail felt impossibly clear.</p><p>She slid into the seat across from her and forced a smile she wasn’t sure how to shape.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>Agatha blinked once. Then gave a tiny nod. Just that. No smile. No hello.</p><p>It wasn’t cold, not exactly. But it hit Rio in the gut anyway.</p><p>The table buzzed around them, coffees slurped, inside jokes, the retelling of a dream Lilia had about being chased by a woman with a cloaked face and a scythe. Everyone laughed. Billy wiped tears from his eyes.</p><p>Rio did not laugh. The noise scratched under her skin.</p><p>She kept her eyes flicking to Agatha, who was smiling as Lilia moved to explain her tarot to her. She fiddled with a napkin at the same time. Her fingers smoothed it. Folded, unfolded, refolded again, as she fiddled with the napkin her sleeve moved up, showing a darker scar along her outer wrist that wove up even further under her sleeve.</p><p>The food came. The table broke into a fresh round of conversation. Someone clinked their glass. Jen leaned in to whisper something to Alice.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha. Her heart beat like it was preparing for impact.</p><p>“Can we talk?” she asked, quiet but direct. “Just for a sec. Outside?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers stopped folding. Her jaw tensed, her shoulders rose almost imperceptibly. She didn’t answer. Not at first. Her eyes flicked to Jen who was watching the interaction, she gave a small nod. Reassuring.</p><p>After a beat, Agatha stood.</p><p>She didn’t look at Rio. Just followed.</p><p>The air outside was easier to breathe in. Softer. The wind had picked up, tugging at strands of hair, and the sounds of the brunch crowd dimmed as they moved around the corner of the café, out of sight. It was quieter here.</p><p>Just the distant hum of traffic. The occasional cough of a bus engine. A pigeon hopping near a gutter.</p><p>Rio stopped walking, folding her arms across her chest like a shield. Her mouth opened. Then closed again. Then opened.</p><p>“I didn’t know,” she said finally. “At the bar. That night. I didn’t know about the accident. But thats no excuse for how I acted.”</p><p>Agatha stood still, a statue of tension. She didn’t look angry. Just wary. Like she was trying to decide how to leave this conversation politely.</p><p>“I thought you were ignoring me,” Rio said. “I thought you were judging me. Like... like you thought I wasn’t worth talking to.”</p><p>Agatha’s chin tilted down, then up. She was breathing through her nose. Steady. Measured. Rio could tell she was chewing the inside of her cheek. Her lips moved once before a sound came out.</p><p>“No,” she said. Slow. Careful. Just one word. But that one word, in that soft voice, nearly undid Rio.</p><p>Rio nodded. Too fast. Her head always moved too fast.</p><p>“I get that now. I—I took it personally. I don’t... always read people right. I see patterns instead of feelings. I look for rules, and when people don’t follow them, I don’t always understand. And when I’m drunk and don’t understand, I can get... angry and mean. Again, thats no excuse. I’m really really sorry.”</p><p>Still, Agatha said nothing.</p><p>“I thought you were trying to make me feel small. And I wanted to get in first. To bite before I got bitten.”</p><p>Her voice caught. She looked down at her shoes, unable to meet Agathas ice blue gaze that was piercing in the sunlight.</p><p>“I didn’t know it was already hard for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly, like she was trying to sort through too many things at once. Her mouth opened, shaped a word, closed again. Her fingers flexed at her sides.</p><p>“You... laughed,” she said. The words came out thick, trembling with effort. She paused between them, like each one needed room. “At me.”</p><p>Rio winced. Her whole body recoiled.</p><p>“I know,” she said. “I know I did.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stayed on her, unblinking.</p><p>“Felt... like I was” She stopped. The next word stuck. She tried again. “A joke.”</p><p>The word cracked as she said it. Like it hurt to form.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said. Her voice dropped. “I made you feel terrible. And small. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha looked away. Her curls blew around in the  breeze.</p><p>“People think...” she began, then stopped.</p><p>Rio waited. Agatha’s jaw worked, slowly.</p><p>“I’m... slow.... they talk at me. Or over me. Or... laugh.” Each sentence came like stepping stones over a turbulent river. Hesitant. Balanced. Vulnerable. “You did.”</p><p>Rio’s hands were fists in her jacket sleeves now. Her mouth tasted like shame.</p><p>“I didn’t think that you were slow, I just thought you were stuck up,” she whispered. “And I wish I hadn’t. I was wrong. But wishing doesn’t fix it.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha agreed, and this time her voice didn’t wobble.</p><p>There was silence then. The kind that stretches long and doesn’t offer comfort.</p><p>“I don’t do new people well,” Rio said, staring at the concrete. “I don’t get subtleties. I miss things that seem obvious. I ask the wrong questions or too many questions, or I say things too flat, too blunt. It’s rude… I don’t mean to be.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her then, tilting her head.</p><p>“Still not... kind,” she said.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You were...” Agatha’s mouth pressed tight again, the struggle with the next work obvious in the tick of her jaw and the way her lips moved as though sounding it out. “Cruel.”</p><p>The word hit like a sentence being passed. Heavy. Earned. Rio’s voice cracked. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her a moment longer. Then gave a slow, single nod. Not really full forgiveness. But working towards, maybe.</p><p>“Don’t… do it …again,” she said, each word slow, measured. Absolute.</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promised.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else. She just turned, walking slowly back toward the café. Her spine straight. She didn’t look back.</p><p>Rio stayed where she was, her arms still folded, feeling the hollow space where her guilt settled. She knew not every apology earned a second chance. But she wanted to try. She knew that whatever came next would have to be earned.</p>

<p>The room smelled faintly of dry-erase markers and dust. It was quiet, just the faint hum of an air vent, the occasional shuffle of a clipboard being adjusted, a chair creaking beneath shifting weight.</p><p>Agatha sat upright in the hard plastic seat, her hands folded neatly in her lap. She was dressed in a structured navy blazer and black jeans, boots polished, the faintest smudge of plum lipstick on her mouth. Professional. Precise. Intentional. Always.</p><p>Across from her, Sharon, the speech therapist, smiled gently and tapped the page in front of them.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod.</p><p>Sharon pointed to the first image. A red apple.<br/>Agatha stared at it, brow tensing.</p><p>Her mind supplied it easily, apple, but the sound jammed somewhere between thought and tongue. She opened her mouth. Closed it. Tried again.</p><p>“Ah…”<br/>She winced.</p><p>Sharon waited.</p><p>“Ah…pul,” Agatha said finally. The syllables scraped out, rounded and slow. “Apple.”</p><p>“Good,” Sharon said. She circled it lightly. “Very good. What color is it?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed. “Red.”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>They moved on.</p><p>An image of a staircase.</p><p>Agatha jaw worked. “Stairs.”</p><p>Sharon nodded. “Now tell me what you do with them.”</p><p>“You…” Agatha’s fingers curled on the table. “Climb… them.”</p><p>There it was, clear, confident. Like slicing cleanly through static.</p><p>She wasn’t stupid. Before the accident, Agatha had been sharp-tongued, eloquent, a woman known for speeches that cut like glass. She hadn’t just run her publishing house - she commanded it.</p><p>People respected her. Some feared her.</p><p>And after the accident, when she couldn’t say her own name without stuttering through it, she’d watched some of those people vanish like smoke.</p><p>But not all of them.</p><p>She’d kept her company. Appointed a co-director she trusted. Delegated when she had to. Wrote, instead of spoke more often than not. And never let herself forget: her mind was still hers.</p><p>Only her voice had broken.</p><p>Sharon moved the sheet aside. “Let’s try some verbs. Use them in a sentence.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin. “Okay.”</p><p>“‘Publish.’”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tapped the table. “I… publish… books.”</p><p>Sharon smiled. “Yes. And you do it well.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, a flicker of pride crossing her face. “I do.”</p><p>Sharon leaned forward. “Agatha… can I ask something harder?”</p><p>“Try me,” Agatha said, slower now, but still clear.</p><p>“How are you doing? Really?”</p><p>There was a long pause. Agatha’s mouth opened, then shut again. She looked down. Her fingers pressed against the edge of the table like she was trying to shape the answer through touch.</p><p>“Some days… are hard,” she said.</p><p>Sharon nodded.</p><p>“People… talk fast. Or they… look away. Or…” She paused. “They think I… am slow.”</p><p>“You’re not.”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha’s eyes lifted. “But… it hurts.”</p><p>Sharon was quiet.</p><p>Agatha didn’t cry. She never did here. But her throat ached, and her shoulders dropped just a fraction under the weight of it all.</p><p>“I hate… this,” she said, and for a moment, her voice almost broke. “Not me. This.” She pointed to her mouth. “I miss… words. The big ones. Complicated.”</p><p>Sharon reached across the table and squeezed her hand.</p><p>“They’ll come back,” she said gently. “You’ve already come so far, your already verbalising more than we could have ever predicted.”</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod. But inside, a storm churned, quiet, constant.</p><p>Because she wasn’t a project. She wasn’t a pity story. She was a woman with a brain full of literature and philosophy and unspoken arguments and ideas that burned hot in the back of her skull, but her own mouth was her gatekeeper now, holding her brilliance hostage behind clumsy syllables.</p><p>Still, she didn’t stop.</p><p>After the session, she left the building with her head high. She pulled her phone from her coat pocket and typed out an email to an author halfway through a manuscript. Notes. Revisions. Praise.</p><p>She was still in charge. Still sharp.</p><p>She just spoke in slower, shorter, sentences now.</p><p>——————————————————————————————</p><p>Rio hadn’t meant to search her. Not really.</p><p>It started like most of her fixations did - quietly, almost accidentally. A name in a search bar.</p><p>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She told herself it was just context. A way to understand. Research, even. Something to satisfy the gnawing itch in her head that wouldn’t let her rest. Not curiosity, exactly. Just... friction. Something unresolved that begged to be filed, labeled, known.</p><p>The search results loaded. Names, interviews, clips. Rio clicked the first link without much thought. Just a thumbnail. A stage. A spotlight. A woman at a lectern, framed by velvet curtains and a wall of rapt faces.</p><p>And then it began.</p><p>The screen blinked into life and Agatha stepped into frame- slightly younger, maybe, but unmistakable. She was wearing an oversized suit that shimmered slightly under the lights, her dark hair glossy and loose around her shoulders. She moved with casual poise, like someone used to owning a room. And her voice-</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Agatha’s voice wasn’t just beautiful. It was magnetic.</p><p>Low, velvety, and rich. It carried, not just through the mic, but through the screen. Into the walls of Rio’s apartment. Into the hollows of her ribs.</p><p>She wasn’t rushing to get her words out. She let each phrase stretch, uncoiling with purpose. Rio, despite herself, leaned closer. Rio caught herself smiling when the audience laughed at her dry punchline. Her timing was perfect. Her mouth curved just a little before the laugh landed, like she knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Rio sat back in her chair.</p><p>This woman-this bright, self-assured, captivating woman-had once stood in front of hundreds of people and spoken like the world was hers.</p><p>And Rio had put her down for stammering out a half-formed syllable following a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>A dull heat bloomed behind her eyes, spreading slowly, painfully. Her body tensed, fingers curled into the sleeves of her jumper like she could squeeze the feeling away.</p><p>Still, she clicked the next link.</p><p>A reel. Shorter clips. Faster cuts. Different versions of the same woman.</p><p>Agatha at a karaoke bar, instagram tagged by Jen, grinning into a mic, oversinging “Killing Me Softly” with her arms flung wide, her voice confident and unafraid. Another too-big blazer slipping off one shoulder, laughter bubbling between the lines.</p><p>Agatha on a beach, laughing mid-run, her head thrown back, the wind ripping at her hair.</p><p>Agatha on a panel, spine straight, voice cool as steel as she quoted Audre Lorde: “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped.</p><p>This wasn’t just “context.” This wasn’t trivia or biography. This was everything she hadn’t seen.</p><p>She clicked another tab. Hesitated. Typed slower this time. Agatha Harkness - accident.</p><p>The articles weren’t front-page news but there was local news coverage, archived interviews, a few medical pieces. She scanned the headlines, her eyes catching on words she didn’t want to see.</p><p>“Three-car collision.”</p><p>“One fatality.”</p><p>“Coma.”</p><p>“Traumatic brain injury.”</p><p>The details blurred at the edges, but the picture was clear enough. Agatha’s car had been struck by a drunk driver in the wrong lane and driving in the wrong direction, head-on. She’d been trapped in the wreckage, unconscious when they found her. Skull fracture. Several broken ribs among other fractures. Internal bleeding. Rio read the words like they were in a language she was only just starting to understand.</p><p>Coma.</p><p>Rio stared at the screen until the words swam.<br/>And still, Agatha had clawed her way back.</p><p>Speech therapy. Walking again. Working again. Her brain - still razor-sharp - learning how to verbalise a sentence without losing the thread. Even though it wasn’t easy. The silences weren’t emptiness. They were effort. They were labor.</p><p>Rio closed the laptop.</p><p>The quiet in her apartment was no longer peaceful. It was pressing. Too much air, not enough room. Her thoughts stuttered - starting, stopping, looping. She stood up. Sat down. Pressed her palms to her eyes until stars danced behind them.</p><p>The woman in those videos, that whole woman, was the same one Rio had mocked, despite her apology. Buried beneath pauses, behind trembling syllables, under the effort it took to say one word out loud without her body betraying her.</p><p>And Rio had looked at all of that and decided she was cold. Rude.</p><p>Because she hadn’t spoken fast enough.</p><p>Because her voice had broken.</p><p>Because Rio had read the silence wrong and let her discomfort do the talking. Her neurodivergence was no excuse, she’d been a horrible person.</p><p>Her phone buzzed. A notification. She swiped it away.</p><p>Then opened her Notes app.</p><p>She stared at the blank screen. Her fingers hovered, then typed.</p><p>I didn’t see you clearly before. I’m trying to now. You don’t owe me anything, but I wanted you to know, I was wrong. About a lot. I want to get to know you. And I’m sorry. Truly. —Rio</p><p>She read it. Then read it again.</p><p>It wasn’t enough. It could never be enough. There were no neat lines to draw under this kind of thing. No “send” button that undid what was done.</p><p>But it was true.</p><p>She saved it to drafts.</p><p>Because maybe Agatha didn’t want her words anymore.</p><p>But maybe, if Rio ever got the chance, she’d find the courage to say them aloud.</p><p>One word at a time.</p><p>——————————————————————————————</p><p>It began slowly.</p><p>A group hang here, a casual dinner there. Nothing formal. No announcements. Agatha didn’t say she was coming, but she started to appear more often - quiet at first, tucked beside Jen or Lilia at the table, listening more than she spoke. The first time Rio saw her again after that brunch conversation, she almost didn’t recognize her.</p><p>Not because Agatha looked different, she still dressed like elegance had rules only she knew, but because something in Rio had shifted. She was looking properly now. Not past her. Not through her.</p><p>At the trivia night two weeks later, Agatha sat across the table, sipping wine and drawing faint circles on a napkin with her fingertip. She didn’t speak much but some words and she smiled a little more.</p><p>When Lilia made a truly awful pun, Agatha’s head tipped back, her laugh, raspy and stuttered, tumbled out. Rio couldn’t stop watching her.</p><p>When Agatha noticed, she didn’t frown this time.</p><p>Just met her gaze and gave the tiniest smile. A quiet truce.</p><p>By the third meetup, a bookshop café visit on a rainy Thursday, Agatha surprised Rio.</p><p>“You read… fast,” she said.</p><p>Her words were deliberate but less halting than before. She was watching Rio’s fingers as they danced across the page of the poetry chapbook she’d picked up.</p><p>Rio looked up, blinking.</p><p>“Yeah. It’s—” She hesitated. “It’s a thing. I read patterns. The shape of words, not just the meaning. It’s like… a map. My brain eats it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, interested. “Like… echolalia? Or… decoding?”</p><p>The fact that she even knew those words made Rio blink again.</p><p>“I guess more decoding,” Rio said. “I learned to read early. But speech… not so much.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow lifted faintly, eyes sharpening with knowing. “Speech… can be…hard.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question. It was a statement.</p><p>Rio nodded. “I talk better when I know the context,” she said. “But I still mess it up. Sarcasm. Jokes. People’s faces. I forget to look or I look too long and then I’ve said something that sounds wrong.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened, and Rio saw it, not pity, but acknowledgement.</p><p>They sat in silence after that, sipping tea. Rain tapping at the windows. The kind of silence that felt like something being offered, not taken.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, something delicate formed between them.</p><p>They weren’t friends, not quite. But they hovered on the edge of it, meeting glances more easily, asking small, careful questions. Agatha started texting her sometimes. Just links at first. A poem here. A song there. Rio sent back sketches—scribbled drawings on napkins and receipts and the edges of notebooks. Things she wouldn’t have shared with anyone else.</p><p>Then one evening, at a rooftop picnic Lilia had organized, Rio caught Agatha watching her. Not in the harsh way that used to make her feel peeled open, but like she was being studied gently.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked, picking at the label on her drink.</p><p>“You don’t… look people in the eye,” Agatha said. Not judgmental. Just observing.</p><p>“I do,” Rio said, “but not always at the time they expect.”</p><p>Agatha gave a slow nod, considering.</p><p>“You flap,” she added, even softer.</p><p>Rio stiffened. Her knee had been bouncing. She hadn’t even noticed her hand flicking at the edge of the blanket.</p><p>“I—yeah,” she said quickly, braced for the laugh, the tone, the you’re so weird she’d gotten all her life.</p><p>But Agatha just said, “Helps?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then… okay.”</p><p>And that was it. No push, no fuss. Just space. Permission. And Rio felt her body exhale a little in response.</p><p>At one point in late spring, they walked home from a late-night diner together—by accident more than design. Jen had offered a ride, but Agatha declined, and Rio had too, without knowing why.</p><p>The sidewalks were quiet. Streetlights buzzed overhead.</p><p>“I liked…what you…said…earlier,” Agatha murmured, voice steadier now. “About translation.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinked, cheeks warming. “That was just me rambling.”</p><p>“No. It was…true,” Agatha said. “You talk like… you think. It’s not bad. It’s… beautiful.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say to that. Her throat went tight, words tangling. They stopped at the intersection.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, then reached out—hesitated—then gently tugged at the end of Rio’s sleeve. Not a touch, exactly. A tether.</p><p>“You’re… getting easier… to read,” Agatha said slowly, the words sticky but full. “Not simple. Just… honest.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the space between them, then back at Agatha.</p><p>“You’re impossible to read,” she whispered. “And I think that’s why I’ like you so much.”</p><p>Agatha smiled—small, uneven, but real.</p><p>“I used to be… all talk,” she said, touching her throat. “Now… I listen.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>She didn’t respond. She didn’t need to. She just stood there, still as the night, while Agatha turned and walked the last block home.</p><p>And when Rio went home that evening, her dreams were full of blue eyes, soft smiles and words that didn’t need to be said.</p>

<p>The day had been wrong from the beginning.</p><p>The coffee shop was out of her usual drink. The train was five minutes late, then ten. Then the driver made an announcement with too much static and not enough context, and by the time Rio arrived at the group gallery visit Jen had planned, her skin was already buzzing.</p><p>Too much light. Too much noise. And her jacket, her soft black jacket, the one that made her feel like a person instead of a problem, had gotten caught on a railing and torn. Just a small rip near the seam. But it frayed her nerves open like a razor.</p><p>She didn’t talk much through the exhibit.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>Jen was laughing too loud. Billy’s voice bounced off the gallery’s concrete walls like ricocheting marbles. The overhead lights were that awful LED kind, bright, blue-white, and humming at a frequency Rio could hear deep in her molars.</p><p>And worst of all: Agatha wasn’t there.</p><p>She’d texted the group chat earlier: I’m stuck at work so running late. Will come if I can.</p><p>Rio had read it four times.</p><p>Now she stood too close to a large oil painting that smelled like turpentine and dust, hands tucked under her arms, jaw clenched, trying not to cry. She’d said she was fine when Alice asked.</p><p>She wasn’t. She was sinking.</p><p>Her mind couldn’t cope. The edges of sound had become sharp, and people were standing too close and asking too much and nothing made sense anymore.</p><p>Then, somehow, suddenly, Agatha was there.</p><p>Her hair was a little messy, loose down her back and windswept, the flyaways catching the light. Her coat half-buttoned. She scanned the room, expression tense until her eyes landed on Rio.</p><p>Agatha crossed to her like she knew.</p><p>She didn’t say anything right away. She didn’t ask, “Are you okay?” the kind of question Rio never knew how to answer in these moments.</p><p>She just stepped in front of her, slow and steady.</p><p>One hand reached out, not touching, just hovering. Like an invitation.</p><p>“Too loud?” Agatha said gently, cautiously.</p><p>Rio gave a short, sharp nod. Her hands were shaking.</p><p>“Too…much?”</p><p>Another nod. Her face was crumpling now, but she couldn’t let it. Not here. Not in public.</p><p>She turned quickly, retreating to a side corridor that was darker and lined with empty benches. She pressed herself into the corner and crouched down, fingers over her ears, rocking slightly.</p><p>It was happening.</p><p>The full meltdown.</p><p>It wasn’t crying. Not really. It was collapse. Her body had taken the wheel and thrown language out the window.</p><p>She heard footsteps. Then softness.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her. Slowly. Cross-legged, back against the wall, like she had time.</p><p>No questions. No gasps. No oh my gods.</p><p>Just quiet.</p><p>After a minute, Agatha pulled a scarf from her bag, a soft, woven thing in a muted plum color—and held it out gently.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Agatha didn’t push. She set it down beside her, close enough to take.</p><p>Then she spoke. Carefully. Slowly. Each word like a rung on a ladder.</p><p>“This is fine… I get its… too much. But you’re not…too much.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders shook. She let out a low sound, like a whimper caught mid-breath.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha added, her voice trembling slightly, “how it…feels. When your body… stops listening.”</p><p>Rio turned, finally. Her eyes were wet, her eyeliner smudged, her hands still curled tight against her face.</p><p>“You’re…safe,” Agatha whispered. “It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut, like that sentence hurt and helped in equal measure.</p><p>They sat there like that for what felt like a long time.</p><p>Eventually, Rio’s breathing began to slow. The shaking dulled. Her hands uncurled, moved toward the scarf, fingers kneading the soft fabric without thinking. It grounded her.</p><p>She glanced at Agatha.</p><p>“I can’t—” Her voice cracked. “I don’t do well with... changes.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, and she meant it.</p><p>“I tried, tried so hard to stay calm. But the light, and the sound, and my jacket—”</p><p>“It’s not …weakness,” Agatha said, firm but soft. “It’s …sensory. It’s real.”</p><p>Rio sniffed. “People don’t understand. I go silent or cry or—flap—and they look at me like I’m broken.”</p><p>“You’re not.”</p><p>Rio looked at her. “You get this?”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “I… lost language. For months. I know the silence. The panic. I know what it is… to live behind glass.”</p><p>Something in Rio’s face cracked open.</p><p>She reached out, tentative, and Agatha met her halfway.</p><p>Their fingers touched, barely, but the contact was electric.</p><p>Not romantic. Just real.</p><p>“I didn’t know someone could see me like this and not leave or make fun of me,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha smiled, just a little. “Your fine.”</p><p>Later, when the group found them, Jen leading the way, a flicker of concern in her eyes, Rio was seated on the bench, calmer, sipping from a bottle of water. Agatha beside her, shoulders touching.</p><p>“She’s okay,” Agatha said quietly, before anyone could ask.</p><p>Jen looked between them, then nodded, as if something had finally clicked into place.</p><p>The rest of the group didn’t press. They moved gently through the rest of the exhibit. But Rio didn’t stray far from Agatha’s side.</p><p>And that night, Rio sent a message.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t in her drafts.</p><p>[Rio → Agatha]<br/>Thank you for being the first person who didn’t try to fix me.</p><p>Agatha responded a few minutes later.</p><p>[Agatha → Rio]<br/>I didn’t need to. Your not broken.</p><p>Rio read it twice, then closed her phone and sat in the dark, letting the truth of it settle into her chest like a steady heartbeat.</p><p>——————————————————————————————</p><p>The bar Jen picked for her birthday was too trendy for Rio’s liking, exposed brick, neon signs, a cocktail menu with more ingredients than instructions, but Jen loved it.</p><p>And everyone had shown up for her: Alice in an open-backed dress, Billy already half-lit and hugging too hard, Lilia with birthday balloons tied to her wrist.</p><p>And then Agatha walked in.</p><p>Rio noticed the hush before she saw her.</p><p>Agatha stepped in from the cold with her hair loose tonight, soft waves framing her face. She wore a deep black dress that hugged her waist and collarbone like it had been sewn there, with long sleeves and a hem that ended mid thigh. Subtle earrings. Subtle makeup with something shimmered at her cheekbones. She looked like a poem someone had taken months to write.</p><p>Rio, halfway through her drink, forgot to swallow.<br/>Agatha’s eyes scanned the room. She smiled when she saw Jen, waved. Then her gaze drifted and when it landed on Rio, her whole face changed. Not big. Not obvious. Just this faint softening. A shared recognition.</p><p>Rio gave a shy wave.</p><p>Agatha came to sit beside her at the bar while the others whooped over some drinking game Jen had insisted on. “You… beat me here,” Agatha said, voice a little more fluid tonight, though the words still came carefully.</p><p>“Miracle,” Rio smiled. “I set an alarm. Like four of them.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly. “Needed… a backup plan?”</p><p>“Needed a contingency matrix.”</p><p>They leaned in close as the noise around them spiked. For a while, they talked, halting, warm, real. Rio had learned over the past few months how to slow down, to pause and let Agatha finish without rushing in. And Agatha had learned how to laugh when she got stuck on a word, how to shrug off frustration with a look that said Still trying. Still here.</p><p>Rio was saying something about the absurdity of edible glitter when a woman with sharp red lipstick and the kind of coat that screamed old money drifted up to the bar beside them.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha turned.</p><p>“Oh my God, it is you. I did the publishers panel a few years ago? Remember? You were always saying something profound and making everyone feel stupid.”</p><p>The smile on Agatha’s face froze. Her body shifted subtly away from the woman, shoulders hunching inward, chin dropping.</p><p>Rio’s senses snapped into high alert.</p><p>The woman didn’t notice. “I heard about the accident,” she said, laughing like it was gossip. “But you look amazing, babe. I mean, honestly, I didn’t think you’d bounce back when I heard how bad it was.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. Her mouth opened. Closed.</p><p>She tried: “I…I’m…”</p><p>The words came out fragmented. Her breath caught halfway.</p><p>“You okay?” the woman asked, blinking innocently. “Or are you… still kind of, like, recovering?” She made a circular motion near her head. “I mean, I know it's brain stuff, right?”</p><p>Agatha’s face pinched. Her mouth moved again. But no sound came.</p><p>That’s when Rio stepped forward.</p><p>“Okay. No.”</p><p>The woman turned, startled. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“No. Whatever you’re doing? Stop.” Rio’s voice was low but firm, anchored in the kind of anger that didn’t need volume.</p><p>“I was just asking—”</p><p>“No, you weren’t,” Rio snapped. “You were performing concern to make yourself feel superior. You didn’t ask how she’s doing, you wanted a story. A punchline.”</p><p>The woman blinked.</p><p>Rio leaned in, gaze flinty. “She’s not an anecdote. She’s not a piece of gossip. She’s a human being and she doesn’t owe you grace for being nosy.”</p><p>Agatha reached out, touched Rio’s wrist, grounding her.</p><p>Rio glanced at her. Saw the faint tremble of a tremor in her fingers, sleeve riding up slightly to reveal the faint lines where metal had once crushed against her, the unspoken thank you in her eyes.</p><p>“I just thought she’d look…worse ,” the woman mumbled.</p><p>“She is right here,” Rio said. “She’s also still herself. And neither of those things are yours to dissect.”</p><p>The woman stood there a beat too long, like she was waiting for the moment to smooth over. It didn’t. Rio didn’t blink. Agatha didn’t smile.</p><p>The woman left.</p><p>Silence pulsed between them.</p><p>Then Agatha exhaled, shaky.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Rio turned to face her. “You shouldn’t have to deal with that kind of thing. Ever. And not in the middle of a birthday party.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat worked as she swallowed. “I… froze. It happens… when I’m caught… off guard.”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain,” Rio said, softening. “She was out of line. I knew what you were saying, even if you couldn’t say it.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a long time.</p><p>“Most people… don’t wait. They jump in. Finish my …sentences. Guess wrong.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “I can wait.”</p><p>Agatha reached for her drink, hand brushing Rio’s. She didn’t pull away.</p><p>“Next time,” Agatha said slowly, “you let me… bite her head…off.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Deal.”</p><p>They clinked glasses.</p><p>Later, when the music was louder and the night had thinned into softness, Rio watched Agatha laugh at something Jen said. Her head tilted back, hair catching the light, mouth wide with joy.</p><p>And Rio realised, this wasn’t fascination anymore.</p><p>It was something deeper. Quieter.</p><p>It was the beginning of falling.</p>

<p>The next time the group met up, it was casual, just a Thursday night catch-up at a little Turkish place by the canal, one with chipped blue tables and mezze platters that came fast and tasted mostly of lemon and garlic.</p><p>The place had too many overhead lights and a floor that never felt level under her shoes, but Rio liked it anyway. It was familiar. Predictable. She could catalogue every item on the menu in her head before she walked in.</p><p>Jen had sent the message like she always did, soft and offhanded, with a kind of deliberate nonchalance that was probably meant to feel effortless:<br/>
Drinks? Hummus? Mild existential dread?</p><p>Rio had stared at the message for a full three minutes and forty-two seconds before replying.<br/>
Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, typing and deleting the same words. "Yeah, I’m in."<br/>
Simple. Safe. The correct response.</p><p>She got there early. She picked the seat in the far corner, the one that gave her a clear line of sight to the entrance, the counter, and the street outside. No one could sit behind her there. No one could surprise her.</p><p>Billy arrived next, already mid-story before he even sat down, something about a new job at a trendy salad place, or maybe a smoothie bar, or maybe it was a soup truck? Rio wasn’t sure. The words blurred. He was trying to explain it but also mocking it, jumping from thought to thought like skipping stones.<br/>
“Basically I’m just upselling chickpeas to influencers. Honestly, I might be the villain here.”</p><p>Then came Jen and Alice, tangled up in each other as always, fingers laced, laughing about something that involved a cat, a blender, and a neighbor named Ralph. 

Jen’s laugh was a specific frequency that made Rio wince if she wasn’t braced for it.</p><p>Lilia came last. Wind-flushed and glowing, her hair caught in the static cling of her coat. She kissed Rio’s cheek gently, without warning, but Rio had been expecting it, so it was okay. She’d prepped for that.</p><p>Lilia sat beside her and opened the menu, exhaling like she was already relaxing.</p><p>That’s when Rio noticed.<br/>
The empty seat.<br/>
One less glass on the table.</p><p>She asked it softly, eyes on the condensation sliding down her water glass.<br/>
“Where’s Agatha?”</p><p>She tried to keep her voice level, casual.</p><p>Practiced the tone in her head three times before she said it aloud.</p><p>Jen didn’t look up. “Oh, she couldn’t make it tonight,” she said, flipping the menu. “She’s on a date.”</p><p>The sentence landed wrong in Rio’s body. Not in her ears, she heard it fine, but somewhere deeper. Like a hand reaching inside her chest and knocking something over.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Jen looked up then, startled by the sharpness in her tone.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, a little slower. “First one since... everything, I think.”</p><p>The table reacted in a scatter of sound, Alice’s “aww,” Billy’s whistle, Lilia’s warm little smile, but Rio couldn’t follow the shape of it. Couldn’t organize the responses into anything meaningful.</p><p>Agatha.<br/>
On a date.</p><p>With someone.</p><p>Rio’s brain tried to process the sentence but couldn’t attach it to anything solid. It was like watching a train pass without ever seeing it arrive. It didn’t fit in the timeline she’d been keeping, privately, without admitting it to herself.</p><p>She didn’t speak.<br/>
Couldn’t.</p><p>Jen looked at her again. Too closely.</p><p>“She said it’s just drinks,” Jen offered, voice softening. “At some little bistro place. Nothing major. She didn’t want to make it a big thing.”</p><p>Not a big thing.<br/>
But it was. To Rio, it was.</p><p>She stared at her glass. Picked it up. Set it down again. Her fingers were cold, even though the restaurant was warm, even though she was dressed for the weather. Her brain started cataloguing the sensations, cold hands, warm room, ambient noise too high, smell of cumin and fried onions, Lilia’s perfume like bergamot and soap, Billy’s laugh too sudden.</p><p>None of it was helping.</p><p>She could picture it too clearly: Agatha in one of her gorgeous dresses, head tilted, smiling across the table. Her voice, her words that were so careful and measured but precious, softening for someone new. Someone who hadn’t called her pathetic all those months ago, hadn’t laughed when she struggled to speak, hadn’t needed to unlearn all their worst instincts just to sit across from her and slowly begin to build a friendship. A connection.</p><p>And why shouldn’t she?<br/>
Why shouldn’t she be wanted?<br/>
Why shouldn’t she date?</p><p>Jealousy was too simple a word for what curled tight in Rio’s chest.<br/>
It wasn’t just that.<br/>
It was grief.</p><p>Because whatever was between her and Agatha, if it was even something, it hadn’t started. Not properly. No kiss. No declarations. Just the slow, careful rebuilding of something that hadn’t even existed yet.</p><p>Glances. Long silences that felt full instead of empty. The safety of being seen, and not looked at.</p><p>And now someone else had stepped into that space.<br/>
Someone had jumped ahead of her in a queue she hadn’t realised she was standing in until this moment.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Jen’s voice again, quiet now. Too measured.</p><p>Rio wanted to lie. She’d practiced lies like this. Had whole scripts memorized.<br/>
She nodded. Shrugged. “Just tired.”</p><p>Jen didn’t push. But she didn’t believe her either.</p><p>The food arrived, and everything blurred into movement: plates passed, glasses clinked, laughter at the edges. Rio matched her reactions by timing, laugh after Billy talks, nod during Alice’s story, make eye contact every 12–15 seconds to appear engaged. She could maintain the illusion. She always had.</p><p>But every time a phone buzzed, she flinched.<br/>
Every time the door opened, she looked up.<br/>
Hope. Dread. A flicker of something that ached at the back of her throat.</p><p>Agatha never walked in.</p><p>At one point, Jen glanced at her phone and smiled, softly, privately.<br/>
Rio didn’t ask.<br/>
She didn’t want to know if it was Agatha and her date that had made Jen smile.</p><p>She just turned her face toward her wine and stared through it, pretending it could refract her future. Tell her if anything she’d hoped for still had time to unfold.</p><p>The walk home took longer than usual.<br/>
Not because of the cold, Rio didn’t mind the cold. Cold was a sensation she could quantify. She liked the sharpness of it, the way it made everything else quiet.</p><p>But tonight, her thoughts didn’t still.<br/>
They spiraled.</p><p>She repeated Jen’s words to herself like a looping line of code:<br/>
She’s on a date.<br/>
She’s on a date.<br/>
She’s on a date.</p><p>It wasn’t wrong. It wasn’t bad. Agatha was allowed to date. She was supposed to want her to be happy. She told herself that five times, ten. But the words didn’t stick. They didn’t soothe.</p><p>She tried to anchor herself in detail: The rhythm of her steps. The scratch of wool gloves. The hum of a distant traffic. But her brain kept going back to Agatha, sharp, brilliant Agatha with her contradictions and her careful kindness.</p><p>The way she’d looked that night at Jen’s birthday, like a portrait Rio couldn’t stop studying. Every detail mattered. Every word she’d said had looped in Rio’s head for days after. She remembered the exact cadence of Agatha’s laugh, the way she held a glass, the delicate way she’d tucked her hair behind one ear.</p><p>Rio had wanted more time.<br/>
More moments.<br/>
More glances, unspoken things.</p><p>And now someone else had gotten there first.</p><p>Someone else might get the words Rio had never found the courage to say.</p><p>Someone else might get to hold her.</p><p>And Rio would be left here, silent, observant, composed on the outside, but unraveling in patterns only she could recognize. Grieving something that had never had the chance to begin.</p><p>——————————————————————————————</p><p>When Rio entered the pub the following Sunday, she saw Agatha almost immediately.</p><p>She was seated across from Alice and Lilia, wearing a soft, deep maroon sweater and black slacks that flowed with her every movement. Her hair was down in a wave of curls, and her lips were a pale pink, slightly chapped from the cold.</p><p>She looked radiant, effortless.</p><p>For a moment, Rio stood frozen at the door, feeling like an outsider to something she desperately wanted to be a part of.</p><p>Then Agatha’s eyes met hers.</p><p>It was a look, a quiet, soft smile, a tilt of the head as if inviting Rio in, making space. Something about it warmed Rio from the inside, like it was the only thing in the room that made sense.</p><p>She forced herself to take a deep breath and walked over to join the group. Her heart was beating faster than she cared to admit, but she tried to play it cool.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, sliding into the booth. She gave Agatha a small smile that she hoped didn’t seem too eager.</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked up in return, the smile warm but casual. “Hey,” she replied.</p><p>There was something about the way she said it, a little softness that made Rio’s chest feel tight. She was getting used to that feeling, but it didn’t make it easier.</p><p>Lilia, in her usual exuberant way, raised her glass.</p><p>“So, how was the date?” she asked Agatha, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p><p>Agatha’s expression shifted, and for a brief moment, Rio caught a flicker of something more guarded, something she hadn’t seen before. But then Agatha smiled again, this time, it was laced with a certain wry amusement.</p><p>“A …disaster,” she said, her tone dry. “Truly.”</p><p>The table fell into a chorus of groans and laughs, everyone leaning forward to hear the details.</p><p>Alice was the first to ask, “What happened?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “She called …my speech… a quirk.” She almost spat the word, like it had left a bad taste in her mouth. “Said it …was ‘charming.’” She mimicked the tone of the woman, and everyone burst out laughing.</p><p>“Charming?” Lilia repeated incredulously. “Oh my God, that’s just gross.”</p><p>“Tell me…about it,” Agatha said. She took a sip of her drink, her eyes glinting in the low light. “And then, she asked… me if I’d… ‘always been this way.’ Like... this way…was some kind…of disease.”</p><p>Her voice faltered for a split second, but only Rio caught it.</p><p>Billy raised his hand in mock surrender. “Okay, I’m officially in love with you for not throwing your drink at her.”</p><p>Agatha gave a small laugh, the sound rough but real. “It was…fine. We’re just not... compatible.”</p><p>“So,” Alice teased, leaning in. “Was it just the way she spoke about your aphasia? Or was there more?”</p><p>Agatha smiled again, and this time it was full of mischief. “She told …me she liked …women with a bit …of mystery.” She paused, giving everyone a moment to let that sink in. “She was… wearing a beret.”</p><p>A chorus of groans erupted from the table, everyone cracking up.</p><p>“Of course she was,” Jen muttered. “Classic.”</p><p>“And?” Lilia grinned, clearly amused by the drama of it all.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, her finger gently tapping against the sides of her glass. “And the… whole night…was so... awkward. She just kept …going on… like I was a case study. She never …asked about …anything …real about me. It felt like… I was a puzzle …she was trying …to figure out.” She paused for a moment, her face flickering with something vulnerable that Rio had never quite seen before. “I don’t want that.”</p><p>It was the most they’d heard Agatha speak at any one time, the most words she’d ever said, the pride that settled in Rios chest took her aback.</p><p>“What do you want, then?” Rio asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>The question hung between them, the words coming out too fast, too sharp. She could feel everyone’s attention shift, their gazes cutting between her and Agatha. Her pulse quickened, her hands suddenly feeling clammy.</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a beat longer than was comfortable. “Someone who …doesn’t think I’m…broken,” she said quietly, her voice steady but thick with emotion. 

She smiled, but it was gentle this time, without any trace of humor. “Who sees…me for who…I am…All of me.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. She hadn’t expected that. She hadn’t expected... this. The vulnerability in Agatha’s words landed on her like a punch to the chest. It was raw, simple, and real — and it made Rio’s heart twist in a way she couldn’t explain.</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but the words stuck. She didn’t know what to say. So instead, she just nodded, her gaze softening.</p><p>Agatha smiled, just a little, as if she understood.</p><p>The conversation shifted after that, but Rio couldn’t shake the weight of the moment. Agatha had been so open, so brave, and here she was — still not quite sure how to navigate the spaces she was meant to be in.</p><p>As the night wound down, and most of the group filtered out one by one, Rio lingered. She stood by the door, eyes down, her hands stuffed into her coat pockets, trying to figure out how to approach Agatha without making a mess of everything.</p><p>Agatha was at the bar, paying the tab for the group. She caught Rio’s gaze from across the room.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice soft. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Yeah. Just...” She shook her head, not sure how to explain what she was feeling. “I was just thinking. About what you said. About wanting to be seen.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened. She came over, leaning against the bar next to Rio. “You see me,” she said, her voice steady. “Even if you don’t always know how. I can tell.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>“I... I do,” she whispered, her voice barely above a breath. “I see you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. It was simple, but it made Rio feel like the entire room had just gone still. Like the world had quieted down, and it was just the two of them in this moment, this fragile, shared understanding.</p><p>And for the first time, Rio didn’t feel like she was just fumbling through the motions. She felt like she might actually know what she was doing.</p>

<p>Rio stood in front of the mirror, checking her outfit for the third time in seventeen minutes.</p><p>She smoothed the fabric down again, a fitted black dress, soft structured trench coat, boots that made her feel taller than she was comfortable with. The dark plum lipstick was a last-minute decision, and it still felt loud on her face.</p><p>She wasn’t used to dressing like this. It wasn’t her usual group meet up attire.</p><p>But she’d read about it.</p><p>The article had been titled something like ‘How to Signal Romantic Interest Without Making It Weird,’ and she’d read it twice, then taken notes.</p><p>The main points: eye contact, body language, confidence, physical proximity, playful teasing, all which sounded like things that came naturally to other people. To her, they felt like acting in a play without a script.</p><p>Still, she had highlighted a line that stuck with her: Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone to be physically appreciated and seen.</p><p>And she wanted to be seen, physically not just emotionally. By Agatha.</p><p>So she dressed in the way the article had said was ‘attention-catching but approachable.’ She practiced her smile in the mirror. She rehearsed questions and responses in her head. She was prepared.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>But when she walked into the pub and her eyes landed on Agatha, everything in her head short circuited.</p><p>Agatha was already seated, curled into the booth between Lilia and Jen, wearing a moss-green cardigan (Rios favourite type of green) over a dark tank top, curls framing her face in a halo of soft brown. Her mouth was pink, and glossy, and her hands were cupped around a glass like she needed its warmth.</p><p>Rio’s brain noted every detail and immediately forgot what her plan was.</p><p>Agatha looked up and visibly froze.</p><p>Her expression was immediate and unguarded: surprise, then something else, something Rio couldn’t determine. Her gaze lingered longer than usual, flickering down Rio’s body and back up again, and her lips parted like she wanted to speak but couldn’t find the words. Her cheeks flushed, visibly.</p><p>Rio knew that look. Not because she recognized it intuitively, but because she had read about it. A flustered expression often indicates attraction or discomfort. Watch for visual cues.</p><p>Agatha looked stunned. Possibly attracted.</p><p>Definitely flustered.</p><p>Rio felt her stomach flip. It was working?</p><p>She made her way to the bar first. It was another tip she’d highlighted - make a confident entrance, don’t rush straight to your person, give them time to notice you. So she did. She perched lightly on the edge of the stool, ordered a drink, and practiced slow, deliberate movements, another strategy.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Agatha glance toward her twice. Once, subtly. The second time, not.</p><p>A woman at the bar leaned toward Rio, blonde, bright lipstick, sharp-lined eyes. “You clean up very well,” she said, voice smooth.</p><p>Rio startled slightly. Compliments were unpredictable, sometimes flattering, sometimes overwhelming. She didn’t know what to do with this one.</p><p>She gave a polite smile, remembering ‘accept compliments graciously, even if they feel unearned.’</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, trying not to sound rehearsed.</p><p>The woman leaned closer. “You here with someone?”</p><p>Panic.<br/>She didn’t want to lie. But she didn’t want to explain either. Her brain stalled. She defaulted to, “Just meeting some friends.”</p><p>It was true. And not.</p><p>The woman smiled, clearly interested. “Maybe I’ll catch you later then.”</p><p>Another fake smile. Another nod. And a silent exhale of relief as she turned away.</p><p>When Rio slid into the booth next to Agatha, who had grown noticeably tense, she felt the static in the air immediately. Their arms barely brushed, and it was like touching an electric wire.</p><p>Agatha was sitting stiffly, posture tight, fingers tapping against the rim of her glass in a nervous rhythm. Rio knew that rhythm. She knew Agatha had a habit of doing that when she was thinking and trying to verbalise.</p><p>“You look…” Agatha said, but the word caught in her mouth like it was too big. Her lips moved again, sounding out the word before it broke free. “Different.”</p><p>Her voice was slower than their last few conversations. Measured.</p><p>Aphasia still wasn’t something Rio fully understood, but she had read as much as she could. She’d spent hours on forums and research papers. She learned how retrieving the right words could feel like wading through mud. How speech could be unpredictable, fluent one day, halting the next. How exhausting it was to fight for words while people stared or filled in blanks.</p><p>She never filled in Agatha’s blanks.l, not since they’d grown closer, content to be patient and wait for them to come.</p><p>“Good different?” Rio asked gently.</p><p>Agatha looked at her again, and this time her eyes softened, even as her cheeks stayed flushed.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, with a tiny, rasping laugh. “You… look like trouble.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, pulse racing. That was on her checklist: teasing banter. But this didn’t feel like a game or a script. This felt real. Was real.</p><p>Lilia nudged Agatha, noticing the faint flush that still clung to her cheeks. “You okay?“</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed together. “Tired,” she said, the kind of answer that meant "please don’t make me explain."</p><p>The conversation swelled around them again, voices rising and falling like waves. Rio didn’t join in. It took her too long to decide what to say, and by the time she formed a response, the moment would have passed. She had learned not to force it.</p><p>Instead, she watched Agatha. The way her blue eyes tracked the group without always catching the rhythm of it. How she stayed quiet when the jokes came fast and stacked on top of each other. She wasn’t disengaged, she was listening intently.</p><p>Rio understood that kind of silence. The kind filled with effort.</p><p>When the woman from the bar passed again and smiled at her, Rio saw the way Agatha’s shoulders tensed. Not violently, just a subtle shift. A stillness.</p><p>Jealousy, Rio realized. Another feeling she mostly understood from books and body language guides - and from thinking about Agatha being on a date.</p><p>And somehow, that made her brave.</p><p>But before Rio could say more, before she could find the exact words she’d practiced in her head a dozen times that week to gage Agathas perception of her, the tall blonde woman from the bar doubled back over again, her presence like a gust of wind that scattered everything Rio had been about to say.</p><p>“Still here,” the woman said with a teasing smile, eyes fixed on Rio like she was the only person in the room.</p><p>Rio startled slightly, her hand twitching where it rested near her glass. Then, like flicking a switch, she shifted into something that looked almost rehearsed: shoulders squared, expression open, tone light.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, “still working out what my next drink should be.”</p><p>The woman laughed, a low, flirty kind of laugh and Agatha watched, something tightening deep in her chest.</p><p>She tried to look away. She really did.</p><p>But her eyes kept pulling back to Rio.</p><p>To the perfectly straightened jacket, the coordinated earrings, the lipstick that matched the wine in her glass. To how she responded , every blink, every word, like she’d read about how to do this, like she was following a script step by step. Not natural, exactly. Tactical. Not Rios usual response.</p><p>And Agatha suddenly remembered the article Rio had mentioned last week: “It said making eye contact increases connection by thirty percent. I want to be better at… people things.”</p><p>People things.</p><p>And Agatha had nodded softly then, not unkindly, because she understood the desire behind it, the exhausting labor of trying to belong when the world felt like it spoke a language just slightly out of sync with yours.</p><p>But watching Rio now, practically performing a role, something in her chest cracked open.<br/>Because all Agatha could think, in a dull, echoing way, was: Of course someone like Rio wouldn’t want me. Not like that.</p><p>Not when she could have flirtatious blondes who knew what to say, how to say it, who didn’t pause every few words just to make their brain and mouth line up.</p><p>“Want to come sit with me?” the woman asked, her voice syrupy. “You look like you belong at the center of a table.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her gaze flicking toward Agatha, quick, unreadable, before looking at the rest of the group who were watching with interest.</p><p>Then she smiled faintly and shook her head. “Thanks. I’m okay here.”</p><p>The woman shrugged, winked, and walked off.<br/>And Agatha, swallowing hard, forced a small sip of her drink just to give her hands something to do.</p><p>Later, when voices around them were fading, glasses were emptied, Agatha stood alone outside the pub, letting the cold cut across her skin in sharp, even strokes. Her speech had unraveled too many times tonight, her nerves on edge since Rio walked in , words catching in her throat, misfiring halfway through. She hated how her chest still trembled with the effort of trying keep up.</p><p>The door creaked open behind her. She didn’t need to turn to know who it was.</p><p>“Okay,” Jen said, standing beside her with her hands buried in her coat pockets. “What the hell is going on?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “What… do you… mean?”</p><p>Jen turned, staring at her like she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “With Rio. You and Rio.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head quickly, defensive “There’s… no…. Me and ….”</p><p>“Exactly!” Jen threw her hands up. “And that’s the problem. You’re watching her like she’s the last warm light in winter, and she’s over here practically spelling it out for you in neon graphics!.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “She doesn’t—”</p><p>“She does,” Jen said, more softly now. “She likes you, a-lot, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression shuttered, mouth pulling into something that was almost a smile but didn’t reach her eyes. “She’s just… kind. That’s all.”</p><p>“No,” Jen said. “She’s not just kind. She’s trying. For you. She wore a dress tonight, and she hates dresses. She spent the first ten minutes counting on her fingers how many times you looked at her, then acted like it didn’t matter when you didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, her voice stiff. “She’s never said… anything.”</p><p>“Some people don’t say it,” Jen replied, gentler now. “Some people just show it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her breath fogging the night air. “She doesn’t… see me like ….that. She sees me as… a friend. Someone who needs help.”</p><p>“She sees you as someone she wants,” Jen said. “She just doesn’t know you want her.”</p><p>Agatha blinked hard, throat tight.</p><p>Jen touched her shoulder briefly. “Don’t you see how hard she’s trying to get you to notice her?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked when she finally spoke.</p><p>“She’s so bright. So… whole. And I—” Her hand clenched into a fist. “I still forget… the word …for soup, sometimes. And she ….deserves someone who ….can say ….everything. Without… failing.”</p><p>Jen sighed, frustration and sympathy woven together. “You think love is about fluency? About saying the right thing perfectly. Your smarter than that!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She couldn’t.</p><p>Jen pulled back, stepping toward the door again. “You don’t need lots of perfect words, Agatha. She’s listening for the ones that are real. And if you’re too afraid to give them to her… you might lose her before you even have her.”</p><p>And with that, she disappeared back inside.</p><p>Agatha stayed out in the dark, eyes fixed on the sidewalk, feeling the heaviness of a silence she didn’t know how to break.</p><p>Because she didn’t believe it, not really.</p><p>Not that someone like Rio, radiant, awkward, earnest Rio, would want someone like her. Not when Agatha stumbled through sentences, not when she hesitated and paused and fumbled over things people took for granted. Not when she had to fight for every word, every feeling, just to name it.</p><p>She knew she was attractive, but she came with so much baggage.</p><p>Rio had never made a move. Never said anything to indicate she wanted anything more.</p><p>So how could she possibly know?</p><p>And maybe that was the most painful part of it all: she didn’t see what Jen saw.</p><p>She only saw what she feared.</p><p>The cold had soaked into Agatha’s fingers by the time she stepped back inside. All of the group had already gone except one. Only a few glasses lingered on the table, half-full and glowing in the amber light.</p><p>Rio was still there, seated alone in the booth where they’d all been earlier. She was turned slightly toward the window, fiddling with the edge of a napkin, her shoulders tense, too tense for someone who was just waiting to say bye.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>She looked so…soft. The curve of her jaw, the way her earrings shimmered against her skin, the careful crease of the dress she clearly didn’t feel at home in. It hit Agatha all at once - too much, too hard.</p><p>Jen had been wrong, Agatha was sure of it. But even so, she needed to say something. Show Rio that she saw her.</p><p>So she walked over.</p><p>Rio looked up as she approached. Her expression shifted, slightly, surprise first, then something gentler.</p><p>Agatha stopped just beside the table. She tried to speak.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Just her name. That was easy. Safe.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, smiling slightly. “Hey. You okay, I thought you’d maybe left already?”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, but it wasn’t convincing. Her hands were trembling at her sides.</p><p>“I…” she began. Her mouth felt too tight, like her tongue didn’t belong there. “You look…”</p><p>She tried again.</p><p>“You are… beau… be-yu…”</p><p>She pressed her lips together, eyes squeezing shut for a moment in embarrassment. The tension in her jaw was visible, the frustration beginning to bubble under the surface.</p><p>“Beau… beau…” She exhaled sharply through her nose, shaking her head. “I know the word,” she said, her voice breaking on it. “I know it.”</p><p>Rio stood, stepping around the table.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she said quietly. “I know what you’re trying to say.”</p><p>But Agatha shook her head, throat tight, words locked behind a wall of glass and panic.</p><p>“No, I… I need to—”</p><p>She tapped her chest, once, hard, like she could knock the syllables loose. Her hands fluttered at her sides, clenched and unclenched, her whole body straining toward the thing she couldn’t quite reach.</p><p>“I want… you to know,” she said, halting. “You look… beautiful.”</p><p>The word came out broken in the middle, fractured, slow, like it had splintered just on the way out.</p><p>Then, immediately, her shields went up. She turned away, her shoulders tight and curled in, frustration rolling off her in quiet waves.</p><p>“I hate this,” she whispered. “I hate… that I can’t… just say it.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached. Not with pity, but with something deeper. A knowing.</p><p>She stepped forward.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said gently, and when Agatha didn’t turn, she touched her arm. “You did say it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No,” she said. “Not the way… I wanted. Not… normal.”</p><p>Rio’s touch stayed light but steady. Her voice lowered, softened.</p><p>“I don’t want normal. I want you.”</p><p>That made Agatha freeze.</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, she turned her head, her eyes wide and shining in the low light.</p><p>“You… you want—”</p><p>“I do,” Rio said. “I know I’ve been awkward and maybe not very good at showing it, but I do. I want you. And it’s not because I feel sorry for you or because I’m trying to be kind.” She stepped closer. “It’s because when I’m with you, I feel like I don’t have to be anyone else. I don’t have to script myself.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her breath shallow. “But I’m… I get stuck. I can’t… always…”</p><p>“I know,” Rio whispered. “I don’t care, your real Agatha.”</p><p>Then, without waiting for permission she couldn’t trust Agatha to give with words, Rio leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t sweeping.</p><p>It was slow. Intentional.</p><p>Their mouths met gently, like a question and an answer, like a breath exhaled after being held too long. Agatha froze for a heartbeat, then melted into it, a quiet, aching surrender.</p><p>Her hands hovered at her sides, then reached up, curling against Rio’s waist and neck like she couldn’t quite believe she was allowed to touch her.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, Rio’s forehead rested lightly against Agatha’s.</p><p>“You don’t have to speak perfectly for me to understand you,” she said. “I hear you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were glassy, her cheeks flushed. She didn’t speak, couldn’t, but she nodded once, and it was enough.</p><p>She was seen.</p><p>She was wanted.</p><p>Exactly as she was.</p><p>And that was the first time Agatha let herself believe that maybe, just maybe, she didn’t have to be fluent to be loved by Rio.</p><p>Rio barely remembered the walk home.</p><p>She must have passed familiar streets, lit windows, the echo of her own boots on pavement but none of it registered. Not really. Her mind was stuck on a loop, rewinding and playing back the same ten seconds, over and over again like her favorite scene in a film:</p><p>Agatha’s lips on hers.</p><p>Agatha’s hands, uncertain but real, curling against her waist and neck.</p><p>Agatha’s breath, warm against her cheek when they finally said goodbye.</p><p>She kissed me back.</p><p>As soon as she closed the door behind her and turned the deadbolt, Rio let out a strangled laugh that surprised even her. It came from somewhere deep in her chest, something raw and giddy that she hadn’t felt in years.</p><p>She dropped her bag on the floor, kicked off her shoes in two mismatched directions, and practically collapsed onto the rug in the living room, flat on her back, arms spread wide.</p><p>For a few seconds, she just lay there, blinking up at the ceiling, heart still racing.</p><p>Then it started. The happiness - the kind that made her hands twitch with energy, her knees bounce, her breath come out in short bursts she couldn’t quite control. Her fingers fluttered up near her face, her wrists twisting, tapping her thumbs rhythmically against each fingertip like she was playing a silent piano.</p><p>She let herself stim freely, unmasked and full-force, rocking slightly where she lay, hands clapping softly, toes wiggling inside her socks. Her smile was too big to contain, stretching her face until it hurt, and still it didn’t go away.</p><p>It wasn’t just the kiss.</p><p>It was the way Agatha had looked at her like she saw something good. Like she saw her fully.</p><p>Like she wanted her.</p><p>Rio sat up abruptly, hugging her knees to her chest, eyes unfocused as her thoughts spiraled with speed and brightness. Her mind ran a hundred miles a minute when she was like this but for once, it wasn’t anxious. It wasn’t bad.</p><p>It was joy. Clean and sharp and overwhelming.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered to no one, pressing her hands flat to her face before letting them fall back into a flutter. “Okay, okay, okay. She kissed me back. She kissed me.”</p><p>She bounced a little on her heels, then stood, pacing the room in small, tight circles. She needed to do something or she’d combust.</p><p>So she reached for her phone.</p><p>Her fingers hovered over the screen. A moment of hesitation. Not fear exactly, just the nervous kind of hope that made her stomach do a somersault.</p><p>Then she typed:</p><p>[Rio → Agatha]<br/>Hey… I know that probably wasn’t planned. But it was perfect. And I’d really like to take you on a proper date. Just us. Something where we can hear each other and actually talk (or not talk — also fine). Are you free this week?</p><p>She stared at the message for longer than necessary. Checked it for tone. Re-read it for clarity. Added a little sparkle emoji, then deleted it. Added a heart. Deleted that too.</p><p>Eventually, she left it as-is.</p><p>Real. Honest.</p><p>She hit send before she could spiral.</p><p>Then she flopped onto the couch and buried her face in a cushion, letting out a squeal so high-pitched it startled her cat, who darted from the room like the house was on fire.</p><p>“Sorry!” Rio called out after him, breathless with laughter. “I’m just, I like her, a lot.”</p><p>The realisation hit her full in the chest, again, fresh and clean.</p><p>She didn’t just like Agatha.</p><p>She wanted her. Because she was Agatha. Because of the way she spoke — carefully, bravely — and the way she listened, and the way her eyes said everything her mouth couldn’t always manage.</p><p>Rio curled up into herself on the couch, still stimming gently, fingers drumming against her collarbone now. A quiet rhythm. A steady beat.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>[Agatha → Rio]<br/>Yes. I’d like that. I’m free Thursday? Somewhere quiet? :) Also… thank you. For waiting when my words don’t show up. You made me feel so much better.</p><p>Rio pressed the phone to her chest and let out a soft, trembling exhale.</p><p>Thursday. Somewhere quiet.</p><p>She could do that.</p><p>She would plan something that felt right, sensory-friendly, low pressure, full of the kind of calm joy that didn’t demand anything. Just space. Just presence.</p><p>Just them.</p><p>And for the first time in a long, long time, Rio didn’t feel like she had to study an article or rehearse a script.</p><p>She just had to show up.</p><p>As herself.</p><p>Because that was enough.</p><p>Agatha had said so, not with perfect words, but with the truth in her eyes.</p><p>And Rio finally believed it.</p>

<p>The café was tucked into a side street near the botanical gardens, low-lit and quiet, with tall windows that let in the fading light. The hum of conversation was soft and low, no blaring music, no overcrowded tables. Just space. Just quiet.</p><p>Rio had found it after an hour of focused research, filtering for all the right things: soft acoustics, dim lighting, no overwhelming scents and sounds - she wanted to be able to give Agatha her full attention, seating options that didn’t trap you in a corner. She’d even called ahead to ask about their menu.</p><p>Now she stood just outside, palms pressed to the fabric of her jumper. She’d chosen something simple, but she felt good in it. Comfortable. Real.<br/>When she saw Agatha approaching, her heart leapt.</p><p>She was wearing a dark forest green coat over a cream blouse that shimmered slightly in the light. Her hair was pulled half-back, the rest curling loosely down her back. There was a gentleness in her eyes as they met Rio’s - that quiet tilt of the head, that soft, open look that made Rio feel grounded.</p><p>“Hi, you been…here before?” Agatha asked, voice light with curiosity as she reached her.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Hi, um… no. It’s sensory-friendly though. I thought it would be nice for both of us” She gave a nervous laugh. “I may have emailed them a list of questions.”</p><p>“That’s… very you,” she said, a little breathlessly, but with affection. “I like it.”</p><p>Rio let out a small laugh, startled, but warmed.</p><p>“Come on,” she said, opening the door. “I asked for a window seat so we can see the gardens.”</p><p>Agatha followed without hesitation.</p><p>As they sat across from each other, something in the air between them softened. There was no pressure here, just the small clinks of cutlery, the scent of tea, and the occasional rustle of pages from a nearby couple reading.</p><p>They ordered, Agatha pointing to the menu that she turned towards Rio with a smile rather than verbalising the dish, but speaking more easily than Rio had ever heard before. The halts were still there, but less jagged. Less sharp. Her hands were relaxed on the table, fingers not clenched.</p><p>“You’re more relaxed today,” Rio said softly, sipping from her cup. “Your speech. It’s… I mean. You seem lighter.”</p><p>Agatha gave a smile, brushing a curl behind her ear. “I… am,” she said. She tilted her head slightly. “You make it… easy. To breathe.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Her chest tightened in the best possible way.</p><p>“I don’t feel… .” Agatha hesitated, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup. “When I’m stressed… my words get... lost. Like fog.” She met Rio’s eyes. “But with you… they come back.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything right away. She didn’t need to. Instead, she gently tapped her fingers against the edge of her mug in rhythm, a quiet, soothing motion that helped center her.</p><p>“I know what you mean,” she said after a moment. “When I mask, it’s like, like I'm acting in a play. I rehearse every line, every face I make, every reaction. And I still mess it up. But with you…”</p><p>She trailed off, cheeks warming.</p><p>Agatha reached across the table, her fingers brushing Rio’s knuckles. “You don’t have to explain,” she said, soft but steady. “I… see you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart fluttered so hard it felt like it might bruise her ribs.</p><p>“Te veo - my mami used to say that, it means I see you in spanish.”</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, the air between them rich with unspoken understanding. They talked about all manner of things — favorite books, the worst movies they’d ever seen, work and their friends.</p><p>Agatha’s speech came and went in waves, but Rio never interrupted or rushed her. She waited.</p><p>Let her shape the silences.</p><p>When dessert came, a shared lavender shortbread with vanilla ice cream that melted on the tongue, Rio surprised herself by laughing real and hard at something Agatha said. Her shoulders shook, her nose crinkled, and she covered her mouth with both hands, letting the sound out freely, without fear it was too much or too loud or the wrong kind.</p><p>Agatha laughed too, eyes shining.</p><p>“You’re… different tonight,” she said, after a quiet pause.</p><p>“I’m not masking,” Rio said. She shrugged. “This is just… me. All the weird bits.”</p><p>“I like the weird bits,” Agatha said, and her voice faltered on the word like, but it was warm and steady by the time she reached bits.</p><p>Rio looked at her then, really looked, and saw not just the elegant calm that everyone else seemed to notice, but the vulnerability underneath. The careful work it took for Agatha to show up every day, to speak, to reach.</p><p>“You’re brave,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha blinked, clearly caught off guard.</p><p>“I mean it,” Rio said. “You show up even when it’s hard. You… speak even when the words don’t want to come. That’s brave.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond at first. Instead, she leaned forward and reached out again, this time, her fingers closed gently around Rio’s.</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. Just once.</p><p>And in the quiet glow of the little café, the world shrank down to just the two of them — two people who spoke in rhythms and silence, in fragments, in pauses and presence. And it was enough.</p><p>The botanical garden was quiet, touched by dusk. The majority of the visitors had trickled out as the staff dimmed the path lights, their golden glow illuminating just enough of the winding trails to feel like magic rather than artifice.</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected Agatha to say yes when she suggested it. She’d blurted the idea just after they paid, not sure if it would be too much, if she’d misread the cues. But Agatha had smiled, that soft, crooked one that made Rio feel like the only person in the world, and said simply, “I’d like that.”</p><p>Now, the cool evening air curled around them, carrying the faint scent of damp leaves and blooming jasmine. Gravel crunched softly beneath their feet. The garden felt vast, but not empty. Peaceful. Muted. Like the world was whispering instead of shouting.</p><p>They walked side by side in silence for a while, not needing to fill the space. Agatha occasionally looked up at the trees, her eyes tracking the shifting silhouettes of branches overhead. Rio, meanwhile, stayed keenly aware of the quiet rhythm of Agatha’s body beside hers, the way her coat brushed gently against Rio’s, the soft inhale and exhale of her breathing, and then Agatha reached for her hand.</p><p>It wasn’t dramatic or showy. Her fingers simply slid into Rio’s like they’d done it a thousand times, as though this was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>And then she started to move her thumb.</p><p>Back and forth. A slow, absent-minded motion across the back of Rio’s hand. A rhythm. A sensory loop. A grounding gesture that sent a surge of something electric and soft rushing through Rio’s entire body.</p><p>Rio stopped breathing for a second.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Her thoughts went fuzzy around the edges, like static wrapped in cotton. The texture of Agatha’s thumb on her skin, warm and steady, just enough pressure to register without overwhelming, felt like it rewired something in her brain.</p><p>This, she thought, is my new favourite feeling.</p><p>Well… her second favourite.</p><p>Because her brain - unhelpfully and joyfully - conjured the memory of Agatha’s lips against hers. The soft give of them, the hesitance, the sudden yes of it. Her thumb moved just a little slower now on Rio’s hand, and it made Rio’s heart stutter in a way she didn’t know was possible.</p><p>She wondered if this would be the rest of her life - logging new sensations she never knew she could love. Like the cadence of Agatha’s laughter. The exact shade of her eyes in low light. The texture of her thumb brushing, always brushing, over her skin like a quiet anchor.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t said anything, still walking at an easy pace. Her expression was thoughtful, her gaze tracing the outlines of a pond just ahead - the surface reflecting the last indigo streaks of sunset. She was calm, and that calm passed through Rio like a gentle current, smoothing every rough, anxious edge she usually carried.</p><p>“I like this,” Agatha said suddenly, her voice soft and low. “The quiet.”</p><p>Rio turned toward her, nodding. “Me too.”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at their joined hands, then back up, her eyes unreadable but gentle. “I’m not…always able to… get the right… words… to say the …right thing. Or fast enough.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” Rio said, instantly. “You don’t have to be fast or right.”</p><p>That earned a smile, a real one. It curved through Agatha’s whole face, her eyes crinkling slightly at the corners.</p><p>“And you?” Agatha asked, tilting her head. “Are you… masking now?”</p><p>Rio blinked, then shook her head. “No. Not even a little bit.”</p><p>Agatha’s thumb paused, then resumed its motion, just slightly slower this time - more deliberate.<br/>“I like this you,” she said, and her voice was a little rough again. “The one… with all…the wild thoughts.”</p><p>Rio smiled, a soft, almost dazed grin that she couldn’t have wiped away if she tried. Her whole body buzzed with the sensation of being held, not just her hand, but her whole self.</p><p>“Do you want to sit?” she asked, nodding toward a stone bench half hidden behind a hedge of flowering azaleas.</p><p>Agatha nodded, and they drifted toward it. The seat was cool, smooth. Agatha didn’t let go of her hand even as they sat side by side. The distance between them vanished again, not with boldness, but with familiarity.</p><p>Rio leaned against her shoulder gently, testing, then settling fully when Agatha tilted her head to rest lightly against hers.</p><p>They didn’t talk for a while.</p><p>Instead, Rio closed her eyes and let herself exist in the moment. The soft pressure of Agatha’s shoulder. The rhythmic thumb against her skin. The hush of trees around them. She rocked slightly, not big motions, just enough to feel. Just enough to keep her body quiet and the joy moving. Agatha didn’t comment. Didn’t look away. She just stayed.</p><p>This, Rio thought, is what safety feels like.</p><p>And for once, it wasn’t theoretical or aspirational. It was here, on a stone bench in the middle of a quiet garden, with the person who kissed her like she mattered and held her hand like it was something sacred.</p><p>Rio opened her eyes and glanced sideways.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha hummed.</p><p>“I’d really like to kiss you again.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, slow and certain, and turned to her.</p><p>“Then do.”</p><p>And this time, there was no hesitation at all.</p><p>——————————————————————————-</p><p>The pizza place was loud in the way Friday evenings always were, full of clattering dishes, boisterous conversations, and the warm haze of people winding down from the week. The air smelled like garlic and oregano and woodsmoke, and their table was tucked into the back corner by the window, dimly lit and cozy enough to feel like a pocket of calm in the noise.</p><p>Rio had been the last to arrive, hoodie sleeves stretched over her hands, a new ring spinning furiously on her thumb. Her eyes were bright and flickering with the kind of energy that meant she’d been hyperfocused on something for hours.</p><p>Agatha recognised that look now. She loved that look.</p><p>But this time, she wasn’t the only one watching.</p><p>Lilia leaned toward Billy, whispering loudly enough for everyone to hear, “She’s going to talk non-stop about some out there thing again.”</p><p>“Sometimes it’s interesting,” Jen whispered back, just as loudly.</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha sure thinks so,” Billy murmured, nodding subtly across the table.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even registered the rest of them having a conversation.</p><p>Her chin was resting in her palm, elbow on the table, eyes locked on Rio like she was listening to the most riveting podcast in the world.</p><p>“…and did you know that some species of mycorrhizal fungi form communication networks between trees? Like actual information superhighways, but made of roots and spores — it’s called the ‘wood wide web,’” Rio said, eyes sparkling.</p><p>She was holding her slice of pizza crust-first, nibbling around the edge in a circular motion, toppings-first, crust-last. “And they can even redistribute nutrients across the network — like, if one tree is sick or under shade, the others will share carbon with it. That’s actual mutual aid, in nature. Isn’t that wild?”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, trying not to look too charmed.</p><p>“That’s…amazing,” she said, her voice low and warm and full of awe. “Like...they’re caring …for each other.”</p><p>Rio nodded vigorously, pushing her hair out of her face and already launching into the next fact.</p><p>“Yes! And they’re so efficient! Like, if you map the network pattern of fungi against subway systems in cities, the fungi are often better — they find shorter routes with less waste. Scientists have started studying them for infrastructure planning.”</p><p>She took another bite of pizza, nearly dropped a mushroom, caught it midair, popped it in her mouth, and kept going without missing a beat.</p><p>Jen, watching this unfold, leaned toward Alice. “Are we seriously not talking about this?”</p><p>“Agatha is literally beaming,” Alice said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen her beam. Is she beaming?”</p><p>“She’s soft-smiling like it’s a Jane Austen adaptation,” Lilia whispered, staring.</p><p>Billy blinked. “She just tucked Rio’s hoodie sleeve back over her hand. That’s intimate.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio was fidgeting with her napkin, tearing off the edges in small, perfect strips while she continued talking.</p><p>“And then, this is so cool, there’s a species called Armillaria ostoyae, or honey fungus, that forms one of the largestliving organisms in the world. It covers almost four square miles underground and is over two thousand years old. It’s one living organism. One giant fungal body.”</p><p>Agatha, still resting her chin on her hand, just murmured, “That’s... incredible.”</p><p>There was something unmistakable in her voice, not awe for the fungi, but for Rio. For the way her eyes lit up, the way she moved when she was excited, the way her thoughts unspooled without inhibition. She wasn’t just listening. She was drinking her in.</p><p>Jen sat back in her chair, crossing her arms with a smug look. “I’m calling it now. They’re dating.”</p><p>“Definitely dating,” Alice agreed.</p><p>“No way,” Lilia whispered. “Rio hasn’t told me. And she tells me everything.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Billy said. “Their keeping it to themselves for now.”</p><p>Back at the other end of the table, Rio finally paused to take a sip of her drink. She glanced at Agatha, blinking like she was suddenly remembering where they were. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to info-dump that much, I just—”</p><p>“I love …when you…do that,” Agatha said quickly, her voice low but certain. “Please don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed, a shade pinker than the warmth of the restaurant lighting could explain. Her ring spun faster.</p><p>Lilia slowly, dramatically turned to the others. “I give it two more meetups before they crack and admit it.”</p><p>“I give it one,” Jen said, raising a brow.</p><p>Agatha finally turned her head and noticed them all staring.</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted. “What.”</p><p>“Nothing,” they all said at once.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes suspiciously. But then Rio laughed, the kind of laugh that cracked open something bright inside her chest and Agatha turned back to her instinctively, immediately, as if the gravitational pull of Rio’s presence was stronger than her desire to be right.</p><p>And Rio, without thinking, reached under the table and laced their fingers together.</p><p>Agatha let out the smallest exhale, and smiled, not the public, polite one, but the quiet one that made her eyes crease and her whole face soften.</p><p>The others didn’t say a word. But they definitely noticed.</p><p>And even if neither Rio nor Agatha said anything aloud, their hands didn’t separate for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Alice’s birthday was held at a cozy rooftop bar with a slightly too small indoor garden area, all trailing fairy lights and mismatched chairs, warmed by space heaters that clicked softly in the background. It was casual and chaotic, just like Alice wanted, with low tables piled with small plates, drinks sweating on coasters, and the buzz of music mixing with conversation and laughter.</p><p>Jen had just handed Alice a side of fries when the door creaked open again.</p><p>“Oh!” Lilia perked up, twisting around. “They’re here.”</p><p>And there they were, Rio and Agatha, stepping in together.</p><p>Rio was halfway through a sentence, fast, animated, utterly engrossed in what she was saying. “…and it’s not just the teeth, it’s the pelvis shape too. You can actually track the evolutionary shift toward bipedalism just by the sacral angle, which is honestly wild when you think about…”</p><p>Agatha was at her side, expression soft, eyes fixed on Rio like she was listening to the most beautiful thing she'd ever heard. Her smile was bright, a flicker at the corner of her mouth, like it was just for her.</p><p>And it was.</p><p>Jen elbowed Billy. “She’s doing it again.”</p><p>Billy followed her gaze and whispered, “Yeah. That’s the ‘I’d watch you narrate a ten-part documentary about rock and thank you for the privilege’ face.”</p><p>Lilia let out a low whistle.</p><p>“Rio looks amazing though right?” she said, motioning with her glass toward Rio’s outfit, loose black trousers, a printed dinosaur blouse, and a soft rust-colored cardigan, “more comfortable than usual?”</p><p>“God-tier,” Alice whispered reverently. “Ten out of ten.”</p><p>“Agatha’s dressed like someone’s chic literature professor,” Billy added.</p><p>She was in long charcoal coat, silk blouse, her curls pinned back with a silver clip. Every detail was elegant. Controlled. Except the way her hand lingered lightly on Rio’s elbow, grounding, casual, for once not tucked beneath her sleeves.</p><p>“Look at her hand,” Jen whispered. “Look at her hand. She’s holding onto her and Rios letting her!”</p><p>Agatha said something or tried to. Her mouth opened, then shut. Her brow furrowed, and her lips twitched like the words were caught in her throat. Rio didn’t flinch. She simply turned slightly, her tone gentle.</p><p>“Do you want me to pause?” she asked softly, voice dropping for just Agatha.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No, just… give …me a sec.”</p><p>Rio nodded and kept talking, but more slowly now,  giving space. She didn’t seem irritated. Not even a little.</p><p>That tenderness was what did it for Jen.</p><p>She leaned into Lilia and whispered, “They’re in love. Like. In love.”</p><p>“They’re definitely dating,” Alice agreed. “Or married. Possibly eloped in secret. I wouldn’t even be mad.”</p><p>As the couple approached the table, Rio was still mid-hyperfocus. “so Spinosaurus aegyptiacus wasn’t just the largest carnivorous dinosaur, it was also potentially semi-aquatic, which changes the whole game. Like, imagine—”</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha cut in gently, finally getting a word out, smiling at everyone while still watching Rio with an incredibly fond expression. “Sorry we’re late….Rio found a new…fossil deep dive…before setting…off.”</p><p>“I printed it out,” Rio added proudly, rummaging in her bag. “Like, from the actual PDF. It’s easier to annotate.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a real one, her head tipping back. “She…made me hold…the pages.”</p><p>“She held them wrong,” Rio said, mock-wounded.</p><p>“I was…trying to get…my shoes… on.”</p><p>Billy grinned. “So, how long has this been going on?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “What?”</p><p>“This.” Jen motioned between them. “The couple-y dinosaur infused hand holding whispery thing. Because I swear, if you two have been dating and haven’t told us”</p><p>Rio froze, startled. Then she glanced quickly at Agatha, a check-in, a question in her eyes, quiet but unmistakable: Do you want to tell them? Is it okay?</p><p>Agatha nodded, almost imperceptibly. And then she smiled.</p><p>“A few weeks,” she said, and though her voice caught slightly at the beginning, it was clear and confident by the end. “Since…Alice’s…last pub night, actually.”</p><p>Lilia let out a sound somewhere between a gasp and a squeal.</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, adjusting her stim ring. “We went on a date. It was very efficient. Botanical gardens, two hours of shared info-dumping, she held my hand. Top tier date.”</p><p>“She also…kissed me,” Agatha added, completely unbothered, tone matter-of-fact, “she…left that…out.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Alice said, smacking her own leg in triumph. “I knew it.”</p><p>Billy shook his head, stunned. “You’ve been this cute the entire time and said nothing?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I liked it being just ours. For a bit.”</p><p>Jen reached over and grabbed a slice of pizza.</p><p>“Okay, but this explains so much. The pizza night? You were gazing. You had the ‘she invented language and stars’ look.”</p><p>Agatha’s ears flushed pink.</p><p>“I don’t…know what …you’re talking… about,” she muttered, but her thumb found Rio’s again beneath the table, slow and soft.</p><p>Rio leaned into her slightly. “You said I was beautiful.”</p><p>“You are,” Agatha replied instantly.</p><p>The group paused. Someone choked on their soda.</p><p>“Oh, they’re disgusting,” Billy groaned. “I love it. I hate it. I want ten more seasons.”</p><p>Rio looked content, like the world had been tilted just right. She wasn’t masking tonight. She was flapping slightly when excited, chewing her straw into fronds, tapping her fingers on the table. And Agatha was right there, patient, adoring, laughing when Rio’s T. rex impression included a breakdown of wrist biomechanics.</p><p>Later, when Alice blew out candles and the group passed around a disposable camera, Jen snapped a candid shot of Agatha mid-smile, watching Rio talk to Lilia about duck-billed dinosaurs.</p><p>It was the kind of expression you couldn’t fake.</p><p>Open. Soft. Unselfconscious.</p><p>“You were right,” Alice whispered. “She’s soup.”</p><p>“She's stew at this point,” Jen whispered back. “Full slow-cooked romantic ruin.”</p><p>And across the table, Rio caught Agatha’s hand again, a silent pulse of contact, and Agatha didn’t even blink.</p><p>She just smiled wider.</p><p>As the night continued, Rio could feel the weight of the evening pressing in.</p><p>Not in a bad way. Not exactly. But there were so many people, and the music was too loud in one corner of the room and too quiet in the other, and the fairy lights buzzed softly overhead, and someone had opened the door to the roof, letting in a breeze that didn’t match the temperature inside and made her skin feel wrong.</p><p>She clutched her cup too tight.</p><p>The texture of the plastic rim was the wrong kind of smooth, squeaky under her fingers, like it would screech if she bit it. She didn’t. But she wanted to. Her jaw was tense from the restraint.</p><p>Agatha was sitting beside her, thumb absently brushing against the back of her knuckles again, grounding. Present.</p><p>It helped.</p><p>It always helped.</p><p>They weren’t pressed close, Agatha never crowded her when they were in public, but she stayed nearby, always within reach. She’d noticed early in the night when Rio started rubbing her palms together in small, frantic loops, and had gently leaned over and asked, very quietly, “Need a…quieter corner?”</p><p>Rio had nodded before the question even finished, and they’d taken ten full minutes in the hallway outside the rooftop bar, sitting on the floor beside a pot of half-dead rosemary and letting Rio re-regulate.</p><p>Now, back inside, Rio was halfway through a monologue about the evolution of hadrosaur crests.</p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure if anyone else was still listening, the edges of her focus blurred when she got like this, but Agatha was. She always was.</p><p>Chin in palm, elbow on the table, eyes fixed on Rio like she was the most interesting person in the room. Which made no sense. Rio had pizza sauce on her sleeve and hadn’t stopped tapping her foot for the past hour.</p><p>She was also eating the pizza weird again, crust first because the tip-to-base ratio felt wrong tonight, and she didn’t like how the cheese slid at the end. It was a textural thing.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked softly between bites.</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “What? Oh. Yeah. Just… my mouth wants to eat the crust first.”</p><p>Agatha nodded like that was the most logical thing anyone had ever said. “Good crust.”</p><p>Rio felt herself soften all over. She hadn't had to explain. Agatha just got it.</p><p>Sometimes words stuck in Agatha’s throat. Sometimes it took her three tries to say a full sentence. But she never made Rio feel bad for being too much or too fast. And Rio never made Agatha feel like she had to rush to keep up. They just… existed. Together. In tandem. Ever since that first kiss,before then even, but more now.</p><p>Billy had wandered over, clearly watching the two of them with interest.</p><p>“You’re really good with her,” he said to Agatha, not unkindly, just observant. “Like… you track her. You don’t get lost.”</p><p>Agatha looked at him, then at Rio, then back. “Why would…I want to…lose her?” she said, slowly but clearly.</p><p>Rio’s ears went pink. She went quiet, flapping her fingers against the sides of her thighs, trying to decide if that was a thing Agatha had meant to say out loud.</p><p>Billy looked charmed. “God. You two are so married.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “It’s been…three weeks.”</p><p>“Emotionally? A lot longer” Lilia said, suddenly behind them, sipping a drink with one of those giant curly straws. “Agatha looks like a woman who’s found religion and it’s Rio talking about dinosaur lungs.”</p><p>“They had air sacs,” Rio said, helplessly, and then clamped her hands over her mouth. “Sorry. That was a reactionary fact.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and bumped their shoulders gently. “Never apologise… for … facts.”</p><p>Later in the evening, when the room was louder and everyone had taken turns singing badly to a ‘90s playlist, Rio started to fray around the edges again.</p><p>She wasn’t unraveling exactly, just dimming. Like her energy bar had dipped into the red and there wasn’t a save point in sight.</p><p>Agatha leaned in. “Want to…go?”</p><p>“I don’t want to ruin your night,” Rio mumbled, picking at the hem of her sleeve. “You’re having fun. People are asking you things. You’re, like. Participating.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, confused. “Why would..I want to…stay …if you’re not …okay?”</p><p>Rio blinked at her.</p><p>“You’re my night,” Agatha said, more softly, fully, without pause or stammer.</p><p>That shut Rio up entirely.</p><p>They left quietly, slipping out the back entrance with brief hugs and half-promises to text later.</p><p>The others watched them go, watched Rio instinctively reach for Agatha’s hand, fingers gripping tight, watched Agatha lean into the contact like it was second nature now.</p><p>“She’s gone,” Alice said, voice thick with affection.</p><p>“She’s doomed,” Billy corrected.</p><p>Jen nodded solemnly. “She fell for her, and there’s no coming back.”</p><p>No one disagreed.</p><p>The walk back to Rio’s flat was slow and mostly quiet.</p><p>Not the heavy kind of quiet, not silence built from things unsaid but the comfortable kind, full of glances and the soft tap of their shoes against the pavement. Agatha’s fingers were still looped with Rio’s, their joined hands swinging gently between them. Every so often, Rio’s thumb would twitch in a rhythm, tap-tap-tap, stop then start again. It was calming. Reassuring.</p><p>They reached Rio’s street just as a light breeze picked up, stirring the trees. Rio stopped by the front gate, hesitating with her keys in hand. She looked up at Agatha, then down at the steps.</p><p>Then back again.</p><p>Her mouth opened, closed, opened again.</p><p>Agatha waited, patient as ever.</p><p>“I was wondering,” Rio said carefully, “if… maybe you’d want to stay over tonight?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. This was new, although she’d been on more dates, they’d not yet progressed to sleepovers.</p><p>Rio rushed to explain.</p><p>“Not in a weird way! I mean, not like…I just…It’s been a long day. I have clean pajamas. And extra toothpaste. I even washed the good weighted blanket. The green one. It smells like lavender now.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression was unreadable for a beat. Then she smiled, slow and warm, and nodded once.</p><p>“I’d… like that,” she said softly.</p><p>Relief crashed over Rio so hard it nearly made her knees buckle. “Okay. Yeah. Cool. Great.”</p><p>Inside, the flat was dim and quiet, Rio had left a lamp on, the one with the yellow bulb that made everything feel like it belonged in a painting. The air smelled faintly like vanilla, leftover from a room spray she liked but used sparingly.</p><p>“I set up the couch just in case,” she said, gesturing, “but you don’t have to sleep there. I just didn’t want you to feel like you had to stay in my bed, like I was assuming.”</p><p>Agatha stepped further in, looking around like she was seeing the space in a new light, even though she’d been before to pick up Rio.</p><p>“I’d rather…your room,” she said slowly, pointing down the hall. “If… that’s okay?”</p><p>Rio nearly tripped over the sentence trying to get it out. “Yes. Yes, absolutely. I mean, it’s clean. I put on fresh sheets. I vacuumed. I even lint-rolled the pillows. Just in case.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, quiet and affectionate. “Of course…you did.”</p><p>The bedroom light was low, one corner lamp casting everything in soft focus. On the nightstand, Rio laid out a small stack of folded clothes in different sizes (“I didn’t know what would feel comfiest so I just guessed, sorry”), a toothbrush in its packaging, and the fuzzy socks with clouds on them that she loved.</p><p>Agatha stood by the doorway, staring at it all with that expression she sometimes wore — the one that looked like someone had just placed something unbearably fragile in her hands.</p><p>Rio fidgeted. “Too much?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, then paused. “It’s… perfect.”</p><p>They changed slowly, not together, but near.</p><p>Agatha in the bathroom, Rio in the bedroom. They both returned in loose cotton, hair down, skin scrubbed clean of the outside world. Agatha smelled faintly of Rio’s soap. Rio tried not to be too weird about how much she loved that.</p><p>They crawled into the bed like it was something sacred.</p><p>Rio stayed still at first, holding herself tight under the covers, unsure if she was supposed to initiate touch or just let the moment be. Agatha answered for her, not with words, but by scooting closer, pressing their arms together gently, deliberately.</p><p>“I’m glad you …asked…me to stay,” Agatha murmured after a while.</p><p>Rio smiled in the dark.</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>Then, because she couldn’t help it,  “Is this okay? Are you comfortable? You can tell me if you need space. Or if it’s too warm. Or if you need quiet. I have headphones. Or a fan. Or”</p><p>Agatha reached over and laced their fingers together again, silencing her with the gesture.</p><p>“This is… wonderful,” she said, voice slow but sure. “Right now. With you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t cry.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>But she did let herself stim gently under the covers, tiny rocking motions, her hand pressing rhythmically to the side of her hip, the kind she usually tried to suppress. Agatha didn’t comment. She just adjusted, breath syncing up like it had always been meant to.</p><p>They lay there for a long time in the dark, side by side, the weight of the moment cradling them as much as the blanket did. Rio’s mind was full, of details, of Agatha’s scent, of the shape of her hand still curled against hers, of how incredibly seen she felt.</p><p>And something shifted when Agatha turned on her side and tucked a piece of Rio’s hair behind her ear. She didn’t speak, not at first, just traced the curve of Rio’s cheek with the backs of her fingers, soft and tentative.</p><p>Rio leaned into the touch, breath catching in her throat.</p><p>“I…” Agatha started, then shook her head, frustration flickering across her face.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio whispered, reaching up to gently cup Agatha’s wrist. “It’s okay. You don’t have to find the words.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were glossy in the low light. “I want… to say… this right.”</p><p>Rio nodded, brushing her thumb slowly across Agatha’s skin. “Say it however it comes. I’ll understand.”</p><p>Agatha took a breath. “I feel…safe. With you. Wanted. Not… not….” She growled in frustration, lips moving to sound the word she was looking for.</p><p>Rio’s chest went tight, her heart squeezing with feeling for the amazing woman beside her.</p><p>“You are wanted,” she said, voice low and sure. “So much.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward first. Not a kiss but a forehead-to-forehead press, the kind that made the world fall away. Rio felt the moment stretching between them, trembling with the possibility of something neither of them had dared speak aloud.</p><p>Then she tilted her chin up and kissed Agatha, soft and slow.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her back.</p><p>There was no rush. No urgency. Just the unfolding of tenderness, layer by layer. They moved gently, checking in with touch, with breath, with each soft murmur of yes. Agatha’s speech faltered when she tried to speak again, but Rio hushed her, not out of dismissal, but with reverence.</p><p>“You don’t have to explain,” Rio whispered, hands skimming the hem of Agatha’s borrowed shirt. “You’re safe. We’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, kissed her again, longer this time and when Rio’s hands found her skin, she didn’t flinch or freeze. She melted.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect. They laughed when Rio got stuck trying to take off her own shirt, and Agatha giggled, really giggled, when she accidentally elbowed a pillow off the bed. But it was theirs. Full of warmth, of careful touches, of quiet, whispered words: there, yes, okay?, yes, you’re beautiful, you’re so soft, I didn’t know it could feel like this.</p><p>When they finally settled into each other, breathing slowing in the warm hush of the dark, Agatha’s head tucked against Rio’s collarbone and Rio’s arms wrapped securely around her, it felt like coming home.</p><p>The next morning came soft and golden.</p><p>Sunlight filtered through the curtains in bands of warm light. Rio woke first, curled protectively around Agatha’s sleeping form. For a moment, she simply watched her, the way her lips parted slightly in sleep, how her curls splayed out across the pillow like ink spilled across linen.</p><p>Rio's hand fluttered lightly against the edge of the blanket, the movement small and repetitive, a quiet stim she didn’t try to stop.</p><p>She was full. Not overwhelmed, just full of feeling, of safety, of something she hadn’t dared name until now.</p><p>Agatha stirred, eyes fluttering open. She blinked slowly up at Rio, and something in her face softened, the way people look when they remember they’re not dreaming.</p><p>“Morning,” Rio said, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Hi.”</p><p>They lay in silence for a while, fingers tangled.</p><p>Then Rio pulled back just slightly so she could see Agatha fully. Her heart hammered in her chest, but the words were steady when she spoke them.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak right away. Her eyes blinked once, then again, wide and stunned, like the words had landed somewhere deeper than Rio had expected.</p><p>Rio swallowed. “I… I know I’m not always easy to read. And I don’t always know when the right moment is. But I’ve loved you for a while now. Even when I didn’t know how to call it that.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat worked as she tried to speak — the words caught and halting.</p><p>“You… really?” she managed.</p><p>Rio nodded. “I really.”</p><p>A tear slipped down Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>Rio kissed it away.</p><p>And when Agatha took several deep breaths, lips forming words before she whispered back, “I love you too,” Rio felt it, that click, that sense of rightness in her bones.</p><p>Agatha’s words came slower, but they were sure.</p><p>They were hers.</p><p>And they were true.</p>
