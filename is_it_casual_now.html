<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was just a regular day for Agatha Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>She was supposed to get out of bed at exactly 5:45, brush her teeth, make breakfast  (which consisted mostly of black coffee and scrambled eggs with toast), put her gym clothes on, and go for a morning run. Simple and easy. </p><p> </p><p>Well, it should be, until her subconscious decided not to wake up to the alarm. To be fair, it has been the same alarm with a melodic tone for over eight years, so it was bound to happen at some point.</p><p> </p><p>As God and all heavenly natures decided to be at her side for once her nosy neighbor, Mrs. Hart, thought it was strange that she hadn’t seen Agatha going for her morning run that morning. That’s how Agatha ended up being woken by knocks at her front door.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck?” She complained, opening only one eye as she tried to understand her surroundings. Before she could get angry with the motherfucker pounding on her door in the middle of the night, she realized it was morning. The sun shone brightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck” A day couldn’t possible be good when her first four words were fuck. Well, not if she was waking up alone.</p><p> </p><p>Someone was still hammering her front door and she went downstairs, wearing a thin robe that didn’t live up to the impeccable appearance that she always carried with herself anywhere. She aggressively opened the door, lips in a thin line and a look that could kill just by its intensity.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Agatha? Sorry dear, I didn’t see you this morning and I got so worried! Are you feeling well? You don’t look good. Do you need me to go grab some medicine for you? It’s not a problem at all.” Mrs. Hart smiled with genuine concern, her eyes at Agatha’s face looking for any sign of illness. </p><p> </p><p>“Ok, first, rude.” Agatha said, clearly irritated at the loud hammering from moments ago and Mrs. Hart implying that she was sick. She just woke up; she knows how bad she must look. “I’m fine, Mrs. Hart. I’m having a late morning, and I wasn’t feeling like going for a run, that’s all.” She lied shamelessly. She'd rather die than admit she overslept. “Now, if you excuse me, I actually have to get going, so give Mr. Hart my greetings.” Agatha said, with her hand on the door to push it shut. She had no idea how late she was, so she really didn’t have time to make small talk, especially with her neighbor that couldn’t shut up even if her life depended on it.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha wasn’t so worried to close the door as soon as possible, she would have noticed that Mrs. Hart’s smile diminished, a purse of her lips taking its place. It was just for a moment, and then her smile returned in full force. “You’re such a darling! How do you know I’ll be going to the cemetery today?” She said, taking Agatha by surprise. “I’ll get out of your way now; have an excellent day, dear! See you for your morning run tomorrow!” Before Agatha could say a word, Mrs. Hart turned back on her heels and left her porch. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wondered if she should feel guilty for completely forgetting about Mr. Hart’s death. How long has it been? Months? Weeks? Either way, she was already late and didn’t have the time to dwell on it. With that, she dashed upstairs to get ready for the day.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The Westview University came into view as she turned right, her left hand on the steering wheel and her right hand firmly holding a large disposable cup of black coffee. She obviously hadn’t had time for breakfast, and now her stomach growled in protest. To put it mildly, she was not in a good mood. </p><p> </p><p>Ten seconds after stepping out of her car, William, her undergraduate student assistant, appeared out of nowhere, scaring the shit out of her. She barely managed to keep hold of her coffee cup, her fingers tightening around it after almost sending it flying from the sudden jolt.</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you too young to come for my job?” Before he formulated an answer, clearly confused by the question, she continued, “So stop trying to scare me to death, Jesus! I have a full day, and I’m already running late. I need to organize some things for my next class, so if you don’t mind, shoo!” She waved her free hand, indicating for him to get away as she quickly walked towards the building where the university’s Criminal Justice department was located.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t leave, deciding to walk alongside her instead. He managed to keep quiet for exactly two minutes. When he spoke again, Agatha jumped almost imperceptibly, having forgotten that William was still there. “I must inform you that a faculty member from the School of the Environment will be coming to see you after your class today to discuss a lecture they would like you to give in fifteen days."</p><p> </p><p>“Fifteen days? Are they joking?” As if fifteen days would be enough for her to prepare a whole lecture, including main points, content, visuals, and a deep understanding of whatever topic they had so kindly thrown at her last minute. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a deep breath, knowing it wasn’t William’s fault, and she couldn’t blame that on him. In the absence of an answer, she said, clearly displeased, “Fine, I will talk to them. Before you go, make sure to print all the handouts for my Law and Psychology class. I’ll need them by lunchtime.” William nodded his head quickly, smart enough to not complain about being an assistant for over six months and still needing to do tasks as mundane as printing shit for her classes.</p><p> </p><p>Gladly, she didn’t have class that morning. She was already considered one of the most severe professors in the department, called a Witch by all her students and even some faculty members. Given how hungry she was, her reputation would’ve taken a nosedive if she had been forced to teach an entire class with a growling stomach. </p><p> </p><p>That’s how she ended up in the university cafeteria. She avoided that place like the plague. The last thing she needed was nosy students looking at her, or worse, talking to her. The line to order at the counter was short, since it was class time, so it didn’t take long for an employee to register her order.</p><p> </p><p>While waiting, Agatha took her cell phone out of her designer bag, looking at messages that went unnoticed while she was busy. In the last few days. Weeks, in fact. She wasn’t very into the device. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Harkness?” A husky feminine voice called, somewhere behind her. She looked up from her phone, looking for who was bothering her outside her office. Well, technically, she was on office hours, but she wasn’t in her office, was she?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was expecting a lost freshman searching for a classroom or the library, but what she found was anything but that. Behind her stood a younger woman, slightly shorter than Agatha, with big brown eyes and straight, dark brown hair perfectly modulating her face. Agatha had never seen her before, so she quickly averted her gaze, stopping before it became too obvious and too creepy.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes? May I help you?” Her voice came out authoritative as always. Her question sounded more like an order than an offer. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, actually. I’m Rio Vidal, Class Representative for the Master of Forest Science. I’d like to talk to you at your earliest convenience. Are you busy right now?” If she noticed how long Agatha stared at her, she didn’t comment on it. </p><p> </p><p>Forest Science? Why would someone in that field need her for? Did she look some kind of weird-ass hippie? Clearly unhappy with the train of thoughts in her head, Agatha frowned. Before she could answer, her order was set on the counter. She took her sad-looking sandwich and her coffee. “You can walk with me back to my office.” She didn’t wait for Rio’s reply, turning on her heels and leaving the cafeteria. </p><p> </p><p>Rio made an effort to catch up, taking long strides until she was walking alongside her. “We are planning a seminar this semester, covering controversial and interesting topics in the environmental field. There was a vote for the first lecture to be about the Flint Water Crisis. Although I know that environmental law is not your primary area of expertise, we wanted to focus on negligence and misconduct by authorities, including potential accusations of manslaughter." Rio talked really fast, as if Agatha would reach her office in the next sixty seconds. </p><p> </p><p>It took Agatha a moment to process the offer, and then she recalled the heads-up about a meeting with a faculty member from the School of the Environment. “Aren’t you supposed to meet me after my class?” She asked. “In fact, I was expecting to meet a faculty member, not a student, to discuss this lecture.” Agatha understood and respected the university hierarchy, so it didn’t make much sense for her to be discussing a seminar with a student. If she were to give a lecture, it would be at the request of the institution itself, not through a roundabout conversation with students.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t seem to mind her hesitation. She smiled, showing her teeth and a small gap between them. Agatha found it charming. “Yes, sorry about that. Professor Kale was meant to discuss this matter with you, but she got caught up and asked me to step in. Since I’ll be stuck in the lab all afternoon, I figured I'd try my luck and find you on campus.” While Rio explained herself, Agatha took short sips of her coffee, which should have been way hotter and much less sweet. She made a disgusted face after the third sip of that horrible beverage, and threw it in the nearest trash can. </p><p> </p><p>Professor Kale? Of course Jen was the mind behind this last-minute lecture. Asshole.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you’re lucky. Because if Kale had come to me asking for this favor, I’d have said no on the spot.” Agatha said, taking a while to understand the implication of what she had said. “I mean…” Why on earth was she trying to explain herself to a student? A very hot and charming one, but still. “Look, I appreciate your offer, but you should speak with Professor Maximoff, she teaches Environmental Law, and she’s the right pick for this lecture.” </p><p> </p><p>“As I said, we are not looking for someone to explain the environmental issues regarding this case, we want someone who understands the criminal aspects of it. What I heard is that you’re the best.” Before Agatha could answer, or even before she could feel her ego glowing under the praise, Rio’s voice sounded more serious even though it had a mocking tone, “You know, you should empty the liquid from the cup before tossing it in the bin. Otherwise, the recyclables will get wet, and some of them will become useless.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped walking for a moment, clearly caught off guard by Rio’s tone and words. Fucking weird-ass hippies.</p><p> </p><p>Determined not to let her irritation show, she smiled and said, “If you’re trying to convince me to give this lecture, you’re definitely taking a very weird approach.” Agatha sighed, thinking about how her day was going completely off track, starting with Mrs. Hart trying to punch her door open. Another sign of how bad the day was going was the sad-looking sandwich she was holding, still untouched.</p><p> </p><p>“My bad, I thought that my personal request was enough to convince you.” Rio’s mischievous smile did not go unnoticed. “Really, Professor, the whole department is very committed to making this seminar a biannual event, and we want to kick things off with the best we have to offer. In this case, you.” </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha's office door came into view, it revealed two students seated on the bench closest to it, clearly waiting for her. “Fine, I’ll do it. Send me an email with the date, any specific topic you want covered, and how much time I will have. I’ll need at least a week to prepare. You’ve got until tonight to send it over.” </p><p> </p><p>“Your lecture can be as long as you need it to be. I’ll be sending all the info to your email as soon as possible. I really appreciate your time, Professor Harkness.” Rio smiled, but this time her lips opened a little wider, and the smile actually reached her eyes. Agatha took a while to recover from the vision, and due to the silence, Rio soon spoke in a lower voice, “Who knows, maybe I’ll be so captivated by your talk that I’ll sign up for one of your classes next semester. That way, it might be easier to get some of your time instead of disturbing your break.” </p><p> </p><p>Was that master’s student flirting with her? Agatha was probably old enough to be her mother, for heaven’s sake. On top of the audacity, Agatha was surprised that any student at that university had the nerve to speak to her without the fear in their voice, the kind that accompanied everyone else who dared to approach her.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t have time to respond, because the two students waiting for her spotted her, and they were on their feet. Rio, still looking at her, said, back in her usual tone, “See you, Professor.” And she left, leaving a stunned Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“How on earth are you preparing a 2-hour lecture on this on such short notice? Have you gone mad? Should I contact the Dean and tell her you’re cuckoo for cocoa puffs?” The inside joke made Agatha laugh loudly in the break room, remembering the time she drunkenly called Wanda cuckoo for cocoa puffs, which her best friend never let her live down.</p><p> </p><p>“First of all, I am fine, and so are my cognitive abilities,” Agatha said, still laughing, “And I found the topic very interesting. Even for a seminar for hippies. I half-expected to be asked to give a lecture on the criminal implications of hugging trees that are about to be cut down by the city and such, but as it turns out, she presented a really interesting subject.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was also laughing at Agatha’s choice of words, who wasn’t worried about saying shit about the hundreds of people that worked or studied in the environmental department. “I teach Environmental Law and I’m not a hippie, thank you very much.” Wanda replied. She got up to turn on the coffee maker, since both of them would have classes soon and they needed some fresh coffee to endure the rest of the afternoon. “I’m very curious to meet this mysterious woman who somehow persuaded you to give this lecture. Every department in this university has tried to convince you to do this, and you’ve always said no.” Wanda arched her eyebrow, confused by the sudden change of behavior.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouted and bit her lip, reluctant to admit how utterly speechless and stunned she was by Rio Vidal. Of course her silence wasn’t unrecognized. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God! Agatha Harkness, has a student finally achieved the dream of all the girls and boys in your classes? I can’t believe it, and here I was thinking you were solid as a rock when it came to your students’ flirtations.” Wanda leaned against the counter, laughing at the conclusions she was drawing from Agatha’s silence. </p><p> </p><p>As for Agatha, she wasn’t enjoying that conversation at all. Her reputation would take a great hit if anyone heard that the Witch was letting a student flirt with her. Or worse, that she might be flirting back.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, Maximoff, Jesus.” she complained, getting up and walking to the door to check if anyone was nearby. “She’s only a student asking for a favor. It’s not my fault I’m the best they’ve got. Me saying yes has nothing to do with her looks, so shut up before someone overhears you saying shit like that.” Anyone else would be offended, but not Wanda. They had known each other and been friends for over twenty years, so she was used to Agatha’s temper. “I have a class to get to, how long is it going to take you to pour this damn coffee?” Agatha asked, clearly still annoyed at her best friend.</p><p> </p><p>Even after Agatha’s tantrums, Wanda was still smiling, shaking her head. “You are very defensive over this whole thing. But whatever, Agatha, I still look forward to your lecture and the brilliant mind behind this interesting subject.” She used the same words that Agatha used previously, which caused Agatha to breathe through her nose several times. If she didn’t need that coffee so badly, she’d have already walked out of there. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha remained silent until a mug filled with hot coffee was handed to her. “Let me thank you in advance on behalf of my students, who will be the ones suffering from my bad mood because of you.” She dramatically shook her coat, making her exit somewhat theatrical. She didn’t wait for the loud laugh that would certainly escape Wanda’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Different from how that day was going, her class was actually as it was meant to be. William delivered all materials she needed for the class and the students weren’t very talkative, which made the class flow quickly. </p><p> </p><p>The first half of the class was an introduction to Psychopathology, and when she was done, she announced, “Put away your electronic devices and books. I want a clean desk. Now.” All the students widened their eyes, utterly baffled by what was happening. After all, it was the first month of classes of the semester, there’s no way they could be having tests already. Right?</p><p> </p><p>“Do I need to bring someone who speaks sign language here? I said, Now.” Agatha’s voice echoed through the classroom, sharp and commanding. For a moment, the only sound was the hurried shuffle of students quickly stowing away everything she'd ordered them to.</p><p> </p><p>“Psychopathology is not an easy subject, and it won’t be the hardest in my class. You must have a solid understanding of criminal law and laws related to mental health. If you’re struggling with such concepts, well, maybe you shouldn’t be here.” Her voice was cold.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s stunt earlier undoubtedly helped her current mood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha handed the stack of papers to the nearest student, signaling for him to take a set of three sheets and pass the rest along.</p><p> </p><p>“You have one hour to complete this test, which covers fundamental concepts necessary to keep up with this class. If you score below a B, see my assistant for additional support. If you score below a D, drop this class immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>She returned to her desk and adjusted her laptop so that she could still see the students. They weren't stupid enough to try cheating, but she enjoyed their terrified expressions when they realized she was watching them.</p><p> </p><p>Forty minutes later, she heard a clearing of throat close to the door. No one else noticed it, since every student was too focused on the test. Agatha turned her head, irritated by the interruption, when she noticed her. Rio Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be right back. Don’t even think about cheating, unless you’re eager to get kicked out before I have the chance to tell you exactly how stupid you are.” Some students shook their heads, others were scared enough to not even take their eyes off the test as she left the classroom to meet Rio. Standing in the empty hallway, near the room’s half-open door, she gestured for Rio to speak.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, they weren’t kidding when they said you carry your classes with an iron fist,” Rio joked, trying to lighten the mood that Agatha carried when she left the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you have a class right now? Or if I recall correctly, weren’t you supposed to be stuck in a lab all afternoon? You know, the whole reason you were chasing after me across campus?” Agatha still hadn’t forgiven Mrs. Hart for ruining her first attempt at breakfast, nor Rio for sabotaging the second. Agatha took food very seriously. </p><p> </p><p>"I was, but see, as it's the first month back, not every professor is committed to tiring their students to death already.” Rio smiled, but this time, Agatha wasn’t having it. It was close to 5 pm. She was tired, hungry, and thanks to Rio, a whole lecture to plan. </p><p> </p><p>In the absence of Agatha’s words or any reaction at all, Rio said, “I apologize for disturbing you. Again. I came here to let you know that the department has given the seminar more thought and decided to assign a student to assist with the lecture.”</p><p> </p><p>With her ears tuned for any suspicious movement inside the classroom, Agatha listened but didn’t fully comprehend what Rio was mumbling about. “Ok, and?” She turned around in time to catch the captivating smile that graced Rio’s lips. She almost smiled too. Almost.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, since every student on this campus is terrified of you, I am the designated student to assist you with this lecture.” That smile on Rio’s face should be banned from campus’ premises, as it was doing something funny in Agatha’s insides. </p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you scared of me?” She asked before she could stop herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiled. “I can handle it.” She replied, bold enough to slowly look from Agatha’s high heels to her eyes, lingering on her lips for a moment.“I’ll still be sending you the email we talked about this afternoon, but we should meet soon to go over the lecture.” Agatha didn’t have time to answer any of that. Soon enough, Rio took out of her jeans pocket a piece of paper with her name, phone number, and a heart painted in black. “Please send me a text so I can save your number. It’s very important for the department that this first lecture goes smoothly.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took the piece of paper carefully, a shiver running up her spine when her fingers lightly touched Rio’s. Agatha withdrew her hand quickly. “If a student somehow gets ahold of my number, I’ll know exactly who to kill.” She winked, her blue eyes lingering just long enough to catch the flicker of surprise on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“As if I’d ever share you with anyone” Rio said with a smirk. “I’ll let you get back to your class now. Thanks again. I can’t wait to work with you.” Rio flashed a genuine smile before turning on her heel and walking away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha returned to her class, her mood slightly better. If her encounter with Rio has anything to do with it, she didn’t admit it. </p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, as the class ended, a line of nervous students quickly formed, each hesitantly handing over their tests with wary glances in Agatha’s direction. They muttered their goodbyes in hushed tones, afraid that one wrong word would be enough for Agatha to force them out of her classroom. As if she were such a merciless witch. Well… not since recent events, at least.</p><p> </p><p>- </p><p> </p><p>At home, Agatha poured herself a generous glass of white wine while waiting for her pizza to arrive. She rarely ordered takeout on weekdays, but today she had earned an exception. It was almost eight, and she was getting more tired by the minute. The second glass of wine wasn’t doing much to help.</p><p> </p><p>When her pizza finally arrived, she started fussing around inside her purse for money when her fingers held a piece of paper. Rio’s number. She signed, going back to looking for a twenty. She finally found it, and handed it to the delivery guy.</p><p> </p><p>She returned to the couch, set the pizza box on the coffee table, and pulled out her phone.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Good evening, Rio.</p><p>It’s Agatha Harkness.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t take half a minute before her phone notified her of a new message.</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha smiled as she took a bite of her pizza. Of course, Rio would have something to say about her not checking her email. She contemplated responding but ultimately decided against it.</p><p>

<p>The next day arrived, and with it, a new alarm sound that would wake up even Mr. Hart six feet under.</p><p> </p><p>After her morning routine, Agatha was ready to begin her day. Her hair was wild yet clean, her light makeup just as she liked it, and she had spent fifteen minutes picking an outfit. A small, unmistakable voice in her head whispered that it couldn’t be a coincidence that she’d spent an extra twenty minutes getting ready, just as Rio Vidal was scheduled to be in her office that very morning.</p><p> </p><p>She made an extra effort to ignore that voice, and she was successful. For the most part of her morning at least.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t have class that morning, so she decided to give Wanda a visit. They often kept each other company when both were free. Agatha wasn’t particularly interested in making friends, and Wanda was more than she could handle. Wanda, on the other hand, was friendly with any breathing thing she encountered. It was annoying, really. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Agatha, I’m glad you’re here. I brought you this as a peace offer. You know, because of yesterday…” Wanda wasn’t really feeling guilty, but she knew Agatha could be spiteful when she wanted to. Agatha knew it too, but that didn’t stop her from reaching out and snatching the pink package with the logo of her favorite bakery. </p><p> </p><p>“How thoughtful of you to bring…” Agatha peeked inside the pink package, “A strawberry frosted donut, as if that makes up for you fucking ruining my mood yesterday. I had to hear that I’m exhausting my students to death in their first month back. Ridiculous.” She rolled her eyes, nodding toward the courtyard outside the Law School building. Her pale skin was a strong reminder that she needed as much vitamin D as she could get. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Is Lilia already implying that you should take it easy with your students in the first month of class?” Wanda spoke as they headed outside. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia? No, why would she? Have you talked to her? I’m serious, I can’t take another semester of her being up my ass every other week.” They were walking side by side. At this hour, the campus was quiet, the usual rush of students nowhere to be seen, which left both teachers relaxed. They sat on one of the benches, relieved that even though the sun was shining, the cool breeze against their skin was a welcome relief.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda shook her head. “Who said that to you, then? One of your students? Oh geez, may the Lord have mercy on this poor student’s soul.” She laughed, watching Agatha make a mess with the sprinkles from her donut, which, thanks to the wind, were flying everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was too busy trying to stop those fucking sprinkles from getting on her pants, and she answered, not aware of the consequences that would certainly follow, “Rio, after stopping by at my class yesterday.” </p><p> </p><p>"What was she doing there?" Don't tell me she's so smitten with you that she's changing careers." Wanda tried to come off as a joke, but her tone was way too serious. Agatha knew it was weird that they had known about Rio Vidal’s existence for 24 hours, yet her name had already escaped Agatha’s lips far more often than she cared to admit.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous. It was just about this seminar thing.” Agatha answered, getting more and more frustrated with the wind. Sprinkles, sugar, and even frosting were going everywhere except her mouth. By this point, Wanda was laughing like a hyena, thoroughly entertained by the chaos of Agatha’s attempt to eat a donut in the relentless fall wind.</p><p> </p><p>“For fuck’s sake-“ Agatha huffed, “You know what? Since you brought this Greek gift to me, just make sure it doesn’t end up all over my clothes.” She didn’t wait for a response, and began devouring the donut with the speed of a starving child. Wanda, totally committed to her role, swept away the stray sprinkles and sugar that fell into Agatha's lap.</p><p> </p><p>There were no people close enough to them to see the scene unfolding: two renowned and respected professors taking a break, their proximity very well known on the campus. However, any prying eyes from a distance would be able to see Wanda’s hands on Agatha’s legs, while both smiled at each other.</p><p> </p><p>Prying eyes that definitely belonged to Alice Wu-Gulliver. Rio Vidal’s best friend.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>10:55 am</p><p>11:00 am</p><p>11:05 am</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was getting more impatient by the second. With an abrupt, furious move, she slammed the big stack of test sheets from the day before onto her desk. She was planning to grade the tests at her peaceful home that night, but why not begin now? Her plans were shit regardless (as Rio Vidal was making clear by being ten minutes late).</p><p> </p><p>She was reading the second question of the first test when there was a knock at her door.</p><p> </p><p>“Come in.” Her voice was sharp. She looked at her silver wristwatch, which showed that it was 11:15.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal entered her office as if it were hers. Her expression was calm, posture relaxed. She carried a bag stuffed with a book, a laptop, tangled charger cords, and a water bottle that leaked faintly. “Sorry I’m late.” Agatha didn’t know her very well, but she could tell her voice was odd. She watched as Rio unceremoniously dropped her laptop onto Agatha’s desk, carelessly placing the equipment on top of some of the tests.</p><p> </p><p>That pissed Agatha off. Even more.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s make something clear, shall we?” Her tone took on a high pitch, pulling the tests out from under Rio’s laptop and placing them in a pile on the side of the desk. “We agreed at eleven. Not a minute before, not a minute later. Eleven. For our future encounters, keep that in mind. I’m using my free time to plan this lecture because no one bothered to notify me in advance, so, Ms. Vidal, try not to make me regret this.” ƒHer blue eyes were icy cold towards the younger woman. </p><p> </p><p>For the first time, Rio’s big brown eyes were even bigger, clearly not expecting the sudden rage. It wasn’t sudden at all, but she didn’t know Agatha very well.</p><p> </p><p>“I said I’m sorry. I am, Professor Harkness, truly. I promise it won’t happen again.” Rio's tone of voice sounded genuine, but the teacher couldn't believe a word because of the way she stared at Agatha. She was lucky she was ridiculously attractive. That was the only reason Agatha chose to move on. Pretty privileges, they say.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine.” Agatha cleared her throat. “Your email didn’t provide much detail about what the department expects from me. So, I took some liberties and drafted some topics that I can cover in the lecture. It’s a very complex case, we won’t be able to discuss everything.” Agatha turned her laptop screen to Rio, showing a document with topics such as criminal charges and prosecutions, accountability, ethical obligations, and impact on the community.</p><p> </p><p>Rio read it at light speed. “It sounds amazing. The Flint Water Crisis is a major case in our studies. I’m sure everyone will appreciate your time on this. I mean it.” She smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “How about I grab us some coffee, and then we can get started? I can help with the visuals, so you don’t have to spend much time on them.” She offered, getting up from her chair. “Don’t worry, I’m not getting coffee from the cafeteria. The campus’ recyclables will live to see another day.” Rio said with a crooked smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed before she could stop it. “Sure, just be quick. I have class in a couple of hours.” If her cheeks were flushed when Rio winked at her before leaving, she chose to ignore it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took less than fifteen minutes. Agatha had no idea where she’d gone to get the two steaming mugs of black coffee, but she didn’t bother to ask. </p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking of a two-hour lecture. As I said, it’s a complex case, and I won’t rush through important points, especially since your classmates might not be familiar with the legal aspects.” Agatha began, reaching for her mug. “They will have thirty minutes for questions. I think that should be sufficient.” Her coffee tasted amazing. Her taste buds did a little happy dance, which improved her mood greatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio agreed by nodding. She looked quite concentrated, which just enhanced her cuteness. “I agree with you. We have environmental law and some other related classes on our curriculum, but criminal law isn’t a focus in our master’s or doctoral programs” Rio blew on her coffee before taking a careful sip, the small gesture oddly endearing. “Which honestly sucks.” She added with a shrug. “If you ever decide to offer a summer course on criminal law in the environmental field, I’ll be the first to sign up, along with half the student body.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I bet all my students are dying to see me during their summer.” Agatha smiled, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“I meant it! Everyone was very enthusiastic when I told them about you saying yes to the lecture.” She paused briefly before saying something that caught Agatha completely off guard. “Unless, of course, you’d rather spend your break with your family. I know I’d hate it if my wife spent her well-deserved break working.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha remained silent for a few moments, trying to process all that information in an acceptable time. Rio using the term wife to make it clear that she was into women wasn’t exactly surprising, but the ease with which she outed herself was undeniably engaging. Maybe that’s why Agatha began talking before her brain had the chance to tell her to shut up. “I’m sure my son would be thrilled if I shipped him off to his father’s beach house for the summer. I think he’s tired of our vacations at Point Pleasant Beach.” Her laugh started out light but took an awkward turn until it became silent. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face twisted so dramatically that, for a second, Agatha thought she’d accidentally put salt in her coffee instead of sugar. “What’s wrong with you? Is it the coffee? I swear, Rio, if this is a bad pot I’ll not be reasonable with you.” Agatha narrowed her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“No no, the coffee is fine.” Rio reassured, taking a sip to prove her point. “Do you have a son?” She paused. “With a man? What about-“ She ran over the words. “What about Professor Maximoff?” At that moment, Agatha’s face mirrored Rio’s, equally baffled. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha frowned. “What the hell are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you married to her? Did you have a son before meeting her? How old is he?”</p><p> </p><p>After three seconds of absolute silence, Rio jumped with the laughter that escaped Agatha’s lips. A cloud, cackling laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you insane? Oh, God. Students really need to get a life and stop spreading these ridiculous rumors.” Agatha was still laughing loudly. Meanwhile, Rio sat on the other side of the desk, completely silent, wearing the same stumped expression as before.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t answer me.” Her voice was low, almost as if she hoped Agatha wouldn’t catch the words.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s laugh died quickly. She studied Rio with curiosity, looking for some sign in those beautiful brown eyes that seemed to look into her soul. Why was she so invested in Agatha’s life? And why was Agatha so willing to let her in?</p><p> </p><p>“I have a son, he’s eight.” She turned a picture frame toward Rio, revealing a photo of the two of them together. Nick was five years old, and he was dressed as Spider-Man, sitting on Agatha’s lap. They were laughing, full of joy while looking straight at the camera. She watched as Rio smiled beautifully at the picture. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t have full custody of Nicky. After endless discussions and fights and countless sessions with a child therapist, they reached the conclusion that the arrangement was for each parent to have equal time with their son.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky was the person she loved most in the world, certainly in any universe, but sometimes she wondered if her life would have been easier if she hadn't decided to go to bed with a man (one of her best friends at the time) after a destructive breakup with her ex-girlfriend. No wonder she’s been single since then. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment, she continued, “I met Wanda more than twenty years ago, so no, I didn’t have Nicky before knowing her.” Rio’s expression became serious again, as if Agatha had just said that she kicked her dog and then ran it over. Several times.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not married. God forbid, we’d have killed each other before the honeymoon.” Agatha laughed again, still finding it amusing about the idea of her and Wanda as a married couple. She couldn’t even picture it. They barely managed to keep their friendship intact with all the constant bickering. “Where did you get this idea from?”</p><p> </p><p>For the first time since Rio had entered her office that day, she seemed to loosen up. She leaned back in her chair, her posture more relaxed, and her gaze toward Agatha softened. “Just a stupid gossip. I should’ve known better than to believe these idiots.” Rio muttered, and she didn’t provide much explanation besides that, and Agatha wasn’t particularly interested. “Your son is really cute, by the way.” She said, her lips curling into a soft smile. “So, you and his dad aren’t together anymore?” Rio arched her brow, her curiosity clearly piqued. Their whole lecture planning was long forgotten. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, he’s too cute for his own good.” Agatha said with a snort. She was surprised with herself by being this talkative with someone she barely knew. For some reason, still unknown, she felt unusually at ease in the presence of the younger woman.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she should refocus on the lecture, but the look on Rio’s face was enough for her to keep talking. “We were never together, actually.” She said, tapping her fingertips on the desk. "Do you pry into all your professors’ lives, or is it just me?" A smirk tugged at her lips as she watched the woman across from her, amused and slightly concerned by Rio's curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>“Only you.” Rio said bluntly, a grin spreading across her face. “But you’re not my professor right now.  Not yet, at least. I’m still holding out hope for that summer course.” She grinned. </p><p> </p><p>A part of Agatha worried that her personal story might become gossip among the campus by the next day. But deep down, she knew that wouldn’t happen. The quiet stretched between them for a moment before Rio spoke again, “I just figured it would be nice of us to know each other, since we’ll be working closely for the next two weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you already know way more about me than I know about you, Rio Vidal, master’s student in your… First year?” Agatha wondered, finishing her coffee. She looked at the clock, fully aware that if they didn’t return to planning the lecture, they wouldn’t have time to do much else.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fair. Let me see…” Rio contemplated for a second. “I am in my first year of my master’s program, and I’m considering going for my doctorate, but I’m still not sure about that.” Rio ran her hand through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear. Agatha had to hold herself back from touching that hair. “I consider myself an environmentalist, but, honestly? The current environmental crises are so discouraging that it’s hard to stay motivated.” Rio sighed.</p><p> </p><p>The honesty of Rio's words surprised Agatha, who was watching her attentively. </p><p> </p><p>“I like to play basketball in my free time, even though I don’t have much of that nowadays. I would invite you to join, but I have a feeling that you’d tell me to shove the ball up my ass.” They both laughed, and Agatha looked at her with nothing but pure adoration.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you’re not wrong.” Agatha laughed again, trying to control her gaze towards Rio so as not to be too blatant about how fascinated she was by the woman. She looked at the clock again and exhaled. “Though I’m enjoying our little heart-to-heart, I’d like to get some things done before my class, Ms. Vidal.” She purposely used the woman’s last name and smirked. “I will leave you in charge of the visuals, then.” Agatha said, leaning back slightly in her chair. "I’ll send you updates via email about the progress. I don’t know if you have booked the auditorium yet, but if you haven’t, you should take care of that as soon as possible.” Agatha turned her attention to her laptop and started typing the main points of each topic they had discussed earlier.</p><p> </p><p>“Aye aye, Professor!” Rio grinned, throwing in a playful salute before turning her attention to her laptop. They remained quiet, each working on their responsibilities. From time to time, one would catch the other glancing, but nothing was said, only smiles were exchanged between them. </p><p> </p><p>When there were fifteen minutes left before Agatha’s class, she announced that they would have to leave, and soon after, they each went their way on opposite sides of the campus.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“Before we wrap up this meeting, I want to personally congratulate Professor Harkness for accepting to be part of our first Forestry Seminar at Westview University.” Lilia Calderu, the university’s dean, announced. “This has been an extensive planning and, let’s be honest, a dream for the entire School of the Environment for a long time. I’m glad both of our largest departments are working together to make it happen.” Lilia smiled, looking expectantly at the professors of the Law School and the School of the Environment. </p><p> </p><p>A round of applause was given, mostly directed at Agatha, who had an embarrassed smile. She wasn’t shy about the attention or the ego’s inflation, not at all. She just had no idea the seminar was such a significant event for the institution. What she initially thought was just a small favor was quickly turning into a major university event, one that could bring considerable attention to her career. Consequently, she knew she would have to work a lot harder to bring that lecture together, especially since the entire faculty of both departments (at least) was closely watching.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, you’re all free to go.” Lilia dismissed her employees, and Agatha wasted no time, immediately rising to gather the materials she had pulled from her purse. She was zipping up her bag when the Dean cleared her throat, much closer to Agatha than she was a few seconds ago. Jennifer Kale stood right behind her. “Agatha, I need to talk to you for a moment.” Her voice was calm and authoritative as always, so Agatha had no way of predicting what the topic was. However, the mere fact that Jennifer Kale seemed to be involved instantly put Agatha on high alert. Agatha nodded and waited by her chair until all employees left, leaving only the three of them. </p><p> </p><p>“Please, professors, take a seat. I’ll be quick.” Lilia gestured for the women to sit on the chair closest to her. After they did it, she spoke, “As I said, the Forestry Seminar is an event that has been planned for a while, and I don’t want it to be a one-off at the university.” The Dean was watching both of them with narrowed eyes. Pretty much everyone in the law and environment departments was well aware of the bad blood between Harkness and Kale. It was surprising enough that they were collaborating in the same event, so everyone was waiting for the moment when everything would explode. As always did when they were forced to work together. </p><p> </p><p>The tension between the teachers was palpable, but they were smart enough to not comment on it. “Environmental crises in our country and around the world are drawing the attention of researchers far beyond the Forestry field.” Lilia stated, holding the edge of the table with her hands as she always did when dealing with serious matters.</p><p> </p><p>“People are now becoming aware of the critical role criminal law plays in understanding and addressing the legal accountability for environmental crimes. As you know, our university's mission has always been to promote justice and contribute to the mitigation of environmental harm.” Agatha stayed silent alongside Jen, both looking at Lilia with respectful attentiveness for what was being said but not fully grasping the purpose of that conversation. </p><p> </p><p>“Therefore, I have contacted some nearby universities about what we want to propose in this seminar and everyone was deeply interested.” Lilia’s smile stretched from ear to ear, and Agatha felt a surge of dread about what was coming next. “We’re expecting to host seven representatives from various universities, along with the executive director of the Environmental Law Institute.” When Lilia finished telling the news, she was certainly expecting some fireworks and celebrations throughout the meeting room. Her wide eyes and broad smile made it hard for Agatha to grimace. </p><p> </p><p>What the fuck? Agatha was expecting an auditorium full of weird-ass hippies burning their brains out trying to understand legal terms and now she was going to give a lecture to doctors and a fucking institute?</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, Jen didn’t share her lack of enthusiasm. She was beaming and clapping her hands together. “Oh my God, Lilia! You’re the best! This will definitely put our department on the radar of large associations and institutions across the country!” </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, right… Nope, nope nope.</p><p> </p><p>“Calm down, Kale, Jesus.” Agatha scowled, looking between both women as they were insane. For her, they were, no doubt. “I agreed to provide my insights and knowledge as a criminal law expert. I never agreed on this.” She raised a finger, catching the attention of both women, who were smiling with excitement at the news that had left Agatha completely startled. “Do you have any idea how much time I will take to do all the research for this lecture now? I can't walk up there with a vague understanding of the environmental side anymore, because my lecture will no longer be just about the criminal part.” Her eyes widened, as if it were ridiculous that she had to state the obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, she was the only one who felt that way. Lilia stood up, still grinning. “I’m sure you can handle it, Agatha. I won’t let you back down now. A big reason this event has grown to this scale is because you’re involved. Suck it up. Work together. Make it happen.” Lilia left the meeting room without giving any of the women a chance to speak.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to Jen, furiously glaring at her. “You can smile all you want, Jen, but if this thing goes sideways, we’re both fucked. You didn’t even bother to tell me Lilia was turning this event into a huge deal! What’s wrong with you? Now I have four days to turn my almost-ready lecture into a fucking case study for experts and nationally recognized institutions!” Agatha slammed her hand down on the table, exasperated. She took her professional path very seriously, and she wouldn’t, couldn’t, have a mishap after so many years of unwavering dedication to academia.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know Lilia was planning that! Do you think I want to count on you? Please.” Jen scoffed. She took a deep breath, finally becoming aware of the possible fallouts of Lilia’s actions. “You better not fuck this up, Agatha. My career is highly reliant on that, and now so is yours.” She said defiantly. “Isn’t Rio Vidal assisting you with the lecture? She’s one of the brightest students in the department. She will help you with the environmental aspects of it.”</p><p> </p><p>The wall clock chimed, signaling the start of a new hour. In other words, it was already five pm, and Agatha refused to continue that discussion with Jennifer any longer. She needed to pick Nicky up at school. His extracurricular activity would be finished soon.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever, Kale. Next time you ask me for a favor- actually, next time you chicken out and have a student of yours ask me for a favor, I’ll gladly say no.” Agatha pretended not to hear Jen murmur a “fuck you" as she stormed out of the meeting room.</p><p> </p><p>In her car, Agatha took slow and deep breaths. Agatha hated being in situations where she felt anything less than completely prepared. Having control, especially in a packed auditorium, was paramount. She couldn’t afford to stutter when answering a question or give even the slightest impression that she lacked complete command of the subject.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her phone and typed quickly before turning the ignition key.</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p>Wine and takeout tonight at seven at my place?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="right">
<strong>Wanda Maximoff</strong>
</p><p align="right">What happened?</p><p align="right">Vision’s at his parents for the night.</p><p align="right">I’ll bring the boys and some fried chicken.</p><p align="right">
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>This fucking lecture.</p><p>We’ll talk later. Have to pick up Nicky.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Eating takeout on a Monday might not be her proudest moment as a mother. Although, Nicky let out a joyful shout and grinned the whole way home when he discovered that, in addition to the takeout, he’d be having a playdate with Wanda’s kids.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“I swear, Wanda, I would’ve jumped on that over-hydrated neck if it weren't for Lilia. The whole thing was nearly done, but now I have to restructure it because I know it isn't detailed enough.” Agatha and Wanda were sitting on the couch, facing each other with a glass of wine in their hands. </p><p> </p><p>After dinner, Billy, Tommy, and Nicky were playing with a new board game that Agatha had bought for Nicky in the hopes of pulling him away from the TV. It was working, apparently. From time to time, bursts of loud laughter, bordering on shouting, echoed through the house from Nicky’s playroom. And, of course, one of them would check to make sure neither child was trying to punch the other. It has happened before.</p><p> </p><p>“Can Nicky stay at your house tomorrow night? I’ll be spending the night working on this and I know I won’t get anything done if he’s here.” Nicky rarely left his mom’s side when they were home alone. When he was a toddler, she assumed that he’d grow out of it, but he never did. Still to this day, Nicky would stick close to her while she cooked, rest his head in her lap while she read, and constantly try to persuade her to do something with him. Most of the time, he succeeded. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha, but we are going to Vision’s parents tomorrow night. His parents are celebrating their wedding anniversary and organizing this whole thing. That’s why he’s there right now, as a matter of fact.” She explained, frowning. She took a long sip of her wine, and Agatha did the same. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck. Well, fine. I will manage. Do you think it’s a bad idea if I invite Rio over?” Agatha asked, tilting her head as she looked at Wanda with a hint of apprehension. “I mean, it’s not a social invitation… I need her help for some topics I want to cover. I can’t bring Nicky to the university, and I really need to finish this thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would it be a bad idea?” Wanda questioned.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t usually make a habit of having students over, Wanda, and I’m not about to start now. God forbid my students start thinking they can stroll down the street to my house, let alone come inside.” Agatha pretended to shiver, which got a laugh from Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re too melodramatic, Agatha. It’s just for work. I doubt any of you students are too eager to step into the Witch’s house.” Wanda said with a chuckle. “Unless… isn’t it just work? I’ve got to say, you don’t talk about her the same way you talk about your students.” Agatha narrowed her eyes at that. She could keep pretending she was treating Rio as any student, but she knew better. Hell, even Wanda knew better. </p><p> </p><p>“It is just work, Wanda. It’s just-“ Agatha hesitated and looked away for a moment. Her gaze settled on her nearly empty glass of wine, and she busied herself refilling it. “She’s different, I can’t explain.” She admitted. </p><p> </p><p>“Try me.” Wanda said, leaning back on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Avoiding Wanda’s gaze at all costs, Agatha stared at the wine swirling in her glass. “I don’t know. She’s insanely smart, and you know how attracted I am to brains.” She chuckled. “I can never tell if she’s trying to get somewhere with me, because she flirts and calls me out on my bullshit in the same proportion. Honestly, I think she’s just testing how far she can push the criminal justice Witch.” Her lips curved into a faint smile, but her stomach turned at the thought that Rio was merely playing with her.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think that’s the case. Come on, Agatha, we’ve seen plenty of students come and go trying to flirt with you over the years, and you shut it down immediately. But not her. I think there’s something there.” Wanda smirked. “But you know how Lilia would react to a situationship between a professor and a student, even if she’s in her master’s program.” She said, her tone turning serious. “So make sure you’re not getting yourself into deep trouble with this woman, because you’ve got a lot more to lose than she does.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, running her free hand through her hair. “I’m fully aware, Wanda. I won’t let this become an issue. I can’t have that in my career. If she-“ She was interrupted by the figure of a child, Nicky, running towards her. </p><p> </p><p>“Mom, mom, I won! Come, you have to check it out.” Before Agatha could respond, he grabbed her hand and started pulling her toward the playroom. </p><p> </p><p>“Calm down, Nicky, I’m coming.” Agatha said, laughing with Wanda hot on her heels. </p><p> </p><p>After the two women entered the playroom, the children, as expected, didn’t let them leave. They played with them for a while before Wanda informed them that it was time to go home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spent the next forty minutes following every step of Nicky’s bedtime routine. By the time he finally drifted off to sleep, she felt utterly exhausted. She knew she would need to come up with some distractions for Nicky the next night when she’d be busy with work. But for the time being, she had an invitation to make, which was making her stomach churn, and the fried chicken she had for supper no longer seemed like such a good choice.  </p><p> </p><p>Once she had showered and was lying in bed, she took her phone from the nightstand. It was half past ten, and certainly not the most appropriate time for her to be sending a text to Rio. She sighed and did it anyway.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Some things have changed, and</p><p>I need to do some additional work for the lecture.</p><p>My son is staying with me this week, so</p><p>can you come to my house tomorrow at 6:30 pm?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t expecting any replies, so she was caught off guard when her phone beeped with the arrival of a message. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">only if dinner’s on you :)</p><p align="right">text me your address and i’ll be there</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, choosing to ignore the dinner mention. She sent her address.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">wow, fancy neighborhood</p><p align="right">lucky me</p><p align="right">sweet dreams, xx</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>As much as Agatha thought she should be feeling anxious about having Rio in her house, she simply didn’t. Her lips still carried the ghost of a smile as she fell asleep.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Nicky, we’re supposed to leave five minutes ago! Hurry up, baby.” Agatha exclaimed while holding her purse, a travel cup of coffee, her bottle of water, and Nicky’s backpack. It was actually her fault that they were late. She’d spent the morning rushing to tidy up the house, knowing she wouldn't have much time before Rio arrived later that day. It wasn’t exactly perfect, but go ahead and try to have a spotless house with an 8-year-old.</p><p>“What happens if you don’t get to your work on time? One time, my teacher was late, and they let us play in the playground. It was fun.” Nicky was sitting on the couch, tying his shoes, completely ignoring Agatha, who was holding more things than her hand could hold and tapping her foot on the floor anxiously.</p><p>“Mom’s boss won’t be too happy about it, I’m sure of that.” Agatha muttered. </p><p>She considered dropping everything to help the child tie his damn shoes, but she collected herself, summoning patience she lacked for everyone else.</p><p>“Who’s your boss, mom?” He asked, and then his eyebrows rose. “Is that nice lady I met at the mall? I remember her. She’s cool.” He smiled and finally made his way to the porch. He stopped in front of Agatha to put on the backpack she was holding, and hugged her, which melted her heart instantly. </p><p>“No, Nicky, that was Jen, and she isn’t cool.” She faked a scowl at him, which made him laugh as she lovingly led him towards the car that was parked in the open garage. </p><p>Once they were finally settled in the car, she drove down the street. It was a short drive to Nicky’s school and she wanted to take advantage of that brief time to let him know about their guest later, as she knew they wouldn't have much time for all the endless questions Nicky always had.</p><p>“Hey, baby, a mom’s colleague will be coming over tonight. We will have dinner, and then we will be in mom’s office to work.” She communicated, holding tight to the steering wheel.</p><p>“Are we ordering food again? I really want pizza.” He said, completely ignoring the news.</p><p>“You’re too spoiled, you know that?” Agatha smiled. “I’m cooking tonight. Your dad will freak out if we tell him that you ate junk food twice in a row.” She laughed along with Nicky, who shook his shoulders. He looked out the window, and when Agatha thought the conversation was over, he proved her wrong.</p><p>“Who’s this colleague? You never invite your friends from work besides aunt Wanda.” He pointed out, suddenly very curious.</p><p>“Her name is Rio. She’s helping me with work stuff.” </p><p>“That’s a cool name. Rio.” He tasted the name a few more times, which for some reason, made Agatha uncomfortable. “Can I help you guys? Please, mom! My drawings are way better.” </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, shaking her head lightly. “I’m afraid your art talent won’t be needed this time, sweetie, but you can watch any movie you want after supper. I’ll set up Disney+ in the living room and you’ll have the whole place to yourself. I’ll even grab some candy from the store for you.”</p><p>Nicky beamed, his eyes brightened at the prospect of having the TV and the couch for himself on a school night. “Thanks, mom! Don’t forget to get M&amp;M’s and peanut butter cups.” Agatha knew she would regret it later, as Nicky’s sugar rush could be a traumatic experience.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn’t have many options, and now promises had been made. She dropped her son off at school and quickly drove to the university, pressing the accelerator harder to avoid being late.</p><p>-</p><p>“To complete our discussion of the credibility of eyewitness evidence, it is important to realize that human memory is not a perfect recording mechanism. Stress, suggestion, and time can distort memory, leading to identification errors.” Agatha stood in front of the class, gesturing with her hands as she wrapped up her class. It was a complex subject, and this was clear from the students’ expressions. Some used laptops to take notes, others notebooks, but everyone was focused, barely blinking as she spoke. Every now and then, she pointed to the presentation projected behind her, reinforcing her points.</p><p>“As I mentioned earlier, even confident witnesses can be wrong, which has profound implications for the justice system, as mistaken identifications contribute to wrongful convictions.” She paused, turning to the presentation, and pressed the button on the small control in her hand. She turned the projector off, signaling the end of the class.</p><p>“We must always question ourselves: how trustworthy is memory in determining someone's fate?” She raised her hands, waiting for an answer she knew wouldn’t come. “This question will be the next main point of your paper. It must contain real-world cases concerning wrongful convictions and discussions on the science of memory. Don’t forget to cite your academic references. If I read a paper with fewer than five references, I’ll know you didn’t put in the effort, and I won’t hesitate to give you a zero.”</p><p>She returned to her desk. “If you don’t have any questions, you’re dismissed.” </p><p>When the students started heading towards the door, she suddenly remembered an important announcement and stood up, catching their attention again. “You will be receiving an email regarding your previous test. For students with a grade below a D, as we discussed, an attached document will be included for you to sign, officially removing you from my class.”</p><p>As the students quickly left the classroom. Agatha took a few minutes to gather her things and slip them into her purse. She still had one more class in the afternoon, and for the first time in a long time, she found herself eager to leave work.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha was back in her office with a headache and a growling stomach. </p><p>She was stopped in the hallway of the Criminal Justice building by a worried student, babbling about his test grade in the Law and Psychology class. No matter what Agatha said in return, trying to diplomatically end the conversation, he refused to let her leave. She retrieved all the patience she could muster, from the depths of her soul, to not shout at the student in the middle of the hallway. </p><p>Whining and insistent students were the main reason Agatha, every once in a while, regretted her decision to build a career in academia. </p><p>Therefore, saying she was in a foul mood was putting it mildly.</p><p>Agatha sank into her chair, letting her head fall back as she closed her eyes. Between her classes, grading papers, the upcoming seminar, having Nicky home (which she loved but was still a worry and responsibility), and Rio being in her sacred home that night, Agatha felt overwhelmed.</p><p>The worst thing that could happen was William showing up with some other responsibility that, among the many she had, she ended up forgetting about. </p><p>And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>“What the hell is that?” Was the first thing she blurted out as the door swung open, revealing William carrying what appeared to be a stack of 50 sheets of paper.</p><p>“Uh, I texted you about it. This morning.” William answered, glancing nervously between the stack of papers and Agatha. Her piercing gaze prompted him to quickly explain. “The enrollment period for your extension project is over. These are the candidates’ CVs.” He explained, holding up the stack. “I’ve already filtered out the ones that don’t meet the criteria from the list you gave me. You know… Program, classes completed, GPA, available time, all that.”</p><p>She puffed loudly. She stretched and lengthened her neck as she considered whether she could assign the responsibility of selecting applicants to William. Unfortunately, she was too much of a perfectionist and control freak for that.</p><p>Agatha reached out her hand. “Yes, of course. It slipped my mind. I’ll have the final list of those approved by this weekend. We’re already behind. You’re in charge of scheduling interviews.” She spoke calmly, as if her inner self wasn’t screaming. William handed her the documents and, knowing her well enough, made a quick exit, practically bolting out of the room.</p><p>She weighed her options for a moment:</p><ol>
<li>She could go for lunch. She always thought more clearly with a full stomach, and maybe that would be the fuel she needed to start assessing all those CVs. </li>
<li>She could start the analysis now, hungry and pissed. Her hunger would sour her mood further, and soon enough, she would want to crawl out of her skin and curse every star and planet in existence while aggressively tearing into the lone granola bar stashed in her drawer.</li>
</ol><p>Of course, she chose the second.</p><p>Agatha read the first document that contained the applicant’s academic track record, a picture, volunteer work, and involvement at the university.</p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver.</p><p>Agatha skimmed through a quick read until something caught her attention.</p><p>School of the Environment? Why the fuck would someone from that department want to enroll in a project extension concerning bias in the criminal justice system?</p><p>The weird-ass hippies were really going after her ass that semester. </p><p>Yeah, fine, Master in Environmental Science with a concentration in Environmental Law. Odd, but somewhat connected.</p><p>Agatha was slightly impressed by Alice’s academic career and didn’t hesitate to start the pile of approved candidates with her application.</p><p> </p><p>An hour passed by. </p><p>Agatha’s foul mood was deteriorating by the second. The granola bar wrapper was discarded across the table, surrounded by various papers and piles of approved and rejected candidates. Considering what time it was, she knew she wouldn’t have enough time for lunch and had already made peace with the idea that she would have to grab a snack from the cafeteria on her way to class.</p><p>A startling tap on her door snapped her out of her concentration.</p><p>“Come in.” She called out. It was probably William warning her about a meeting or an assignment that would make her want to kick his ass straight to the Southwest. </p><p>The person behind the door wasn’t in a rush, opening it slowly. It took Agatha a moment to process who was standing there.</p><p>Rio. </p><p>Rio was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved t-shirt, with a lab coat draped over her arm. She carried a backpack and a takeout bag. </p><p>“Hey.” She said, raising an eyebrow as she took in the mess on Agatha's desk. Who was she to judge her well-organized chaos?</p><p>Rio closed the door, and Agatha’s eyes once again roamed over Rio’s body. The younger woman walked and stopped next to the empty chair.</p><p>“Hello, Ms. Vidal.” Agatha greeted the student. “Can I help you?” </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio’s face once more, taking an extra second to return her analysis to the document in her hands.</p><p>“Not really. I brought you lunch.” Rio offered the bag to Agatha, who hesitated, confused as hell. “I bumped into William just now and asked if you were in your office.” She started explaining, and Agatha still didn’t make a move to take the bag. “"He said you were, but coming now wasn't a good idea because you hadn't eaten lunch and were probably hungry out of your mind.” Rio laughed softly.</p><p>How did Rio even know William? And why the hell was William telling other people she was a bitch when she was hungry? Agatha didn’t know for sure if he’d actually used those words, but she didn’t doubt it. </p><p>Agatha still hadn’t replied, and Rio was amused by the situation that was clearly making the professor very uneasy.</p><p>“Come on, are you that hungry that you don’t even have the energy to talk to me?” Rio teased, chuckling. She moved over to the sofa tucked in the corner of the office, one that Agatha rarely used and often forgot even existed. Rio plopped down and patted the cushion beside her, inviting Agatha to join her.</p><p>Agatha got up from her chair to head towards the sofa before her brain had any say in it.</p><p>“So… How do you know my assistant?” Agatha asked, curious, and sat down next to Rio, keeping a respectable distance between them.</p><p>Rio placed the bag on the center table and started unpacking its contents. “He’s a friend of a friend of mine. We’ve seen each other a few times at gatherings.” She answered. The smell of tacos instantly filled Agatha’s office, and her stomach betrayed her with an audible growl. She could feel her mouth watering. </p><p>“Don’t you ever have a proper meal? I recall that awful-looking sandwich you got at the cafeteria the day we met. It was sad, really.” She teased, pulling out two bottles of water, and handed one to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha smiled, remembering that she ended up not even eating that thing because she was too entranced by Rio. “I do. I’ve just been particularly busy lately.” Agatha explained. She twisted open the bottle of water and drank nearly half of it in one go. Rio’s eyes were fixed on Agatha’s neck, following the movement of her throat as she swallowed.</p><p>Rio still hadn’t looked away when Agatha capped the bottle again with a teasing smile on her face. Rio cleared her throat. “This is yours. I asked William if you eat meat, and he said you do, so-“ She handed Agatha a wrapped Taco. “I’m a vegetarian.” Rio added, which promptly made Agatha laugh.</p><p>“Of course you are.” As she always pointed out: weird-ass hippies. </p><p>“What do you mean by that?” Rio asked, unwrapping her food and Agatha did the same.</p><p>“Isn’t it a prerequisite to frequent your building?” </p><p>“You have a very superficial view of people in the environmental field, do you know that?” The smirk on Rio’s lips betrayed her attempt to reprimand Agatha.</p><p>“Oh, do I? So you’re telling me that most of your colleagues eat meat?” Agatha raised an eyebrow. She took a bite of her taco while carefully balancing the mix of vegetables so it wouldn’t spill onto her lap or the sofa.</p><p>“Well..” Rio bit her lip to avoid answering, earning a laugh from Agatha.</p><p>They began eating their tacos and the room fell into a momentary and comfortable silence.</p><p>“I’m meeting your son tonight, huh? Any tips so I can get on his good side?” Rio asked, her lips curving into a playful smile.</p><p>“He’s eight, Rio. Be nice to him and you’ll be fine.” Agatha answered shortly. She didn’t want Rio getting too close to Nicky. To him, Rio was just a person from work. But to Agatha… Well, she had no fucking clue.</p><p>“Your mood really swings when you’re hungry, huh?” Rio pointed out, arching a brow at Agatha.</p><p>“Sorry, I–” Agatha breathed deeply. “It’s just been a long couple of weeks.” She felt exhausted, and the amount of responsibilities and people counting on her was grueling. The worst was that the semester had barely started.</p><p>Rio placed her taco on the table, and stretched her hand towards Agatha, placing her fingers on her wrist. “Hey, no need to apologize. I was just kidding.” She smiled softly. “What were you working on? When I arrived.” Rio didn’t let go of Agatha’s wrist. Instead, her fingers were tracing slow, deliberate circles against her skin.</p><p>Maybe it was the exhaustion, but Agatha let her.</p><p>“Assessing some applications for my extension project. By the way, I received an application from a student in your field.”</p><p>“Oh, I know. Alice. She told me she was trying to get into the Witch’s project.” Rio chuckled, not bothered to use Agatha’s nickname out loud. </p><p>Agatha was so used to hearing that nickname whispered in hallways by people who had no idea she was within earshot that Rio saying that in such a casual way made Agatha laugh. “Why? She thought that because she’s your friend, she would have a free pass to join the project?” Agatha was smiling, her bitter disposition vanished.   </p><p>“Would that work?” </p><p>“No.” </p><p>“Damn, I really thought that getting on the Witch’s good side would have some perks.” </p><p>Caught off guard by the way Rio was watching her with open adoration when Agatha laughed again, Agatha suddenly became aware of the gentle strokes of Rio’s fingers on her wrist and now, tracing delicate patterns along her forearm as well.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Who says you’re on my good side?” She smiled again and placed what was left of her taco on the table, and the movement distanced her arm from Rio, who dropped her hand into her lap.</p><p>Rio pointedly looked around the office and then back at the professor. “I don’t see anyone else eating lunch with you in your office, do I?” </p><p>“I guess not.” Agatha answered, and before the silence could stretch any longer, she got up from the couch and busied herself gathering the trash.</p><p>Rio stood up as well. “I see you tonight, then?” Rio asked, her eyes sparkling. It seemed unfair for someone already so extraordinarily beautiful to have pretty eyes like that.</p><p>Her voice was a little hoarse (she blamed it on the hot sauce on the taco) when she replied, “Yes. Don’t be late. I want this whole lecture done before I go to sleep tonight.” She turned her back to Rio and walked toward her chair.</p><p>“I don’t plan on sleeping much tonight anyway.” Rio said, letting out a laugh while she waited for the commentary to land.</p><p>Agatha stopped and turned to the student. “Careful, Ms. Vidal. Don’t make me regret this.” Agatha watched as Rio smiled nonchalantly and left her office.</p><p>-</p><p>Between getting Nicky’s candy at the store, picking him up from school, and driving home, Agatha had less than forty minutes until Rio’s arrival.</p><p>“Shit!” She yelped, pulling her hand back sharply after catching her finger in the cabinet while unloading the dishwasher. Agatha was fully conscious that Rio would not come into her home and check the dishwater, but her anxiety was reaching its peak and she needed something to do.</p><p>“You said that whoever says that gets on Santa’s blacklist.” Nicky suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and Agatha jumped out of her skin.</p><p>“Jesus, Nicky! Don’t sneak up on me like that.” She scolded. Her heart was racing for a very different reason now and she almost thanked her kid for that. </p><p>He was unfazed by her dramatics and merely shrugged. “What are we having for dinner, mom? I’m starving.” Nicky asked, making a beeline for the cupboard to look for some unhealthy snack. </p><p>“Pesto pasta.” She answered, watching him rummaging through the cupboard. “Hey, no snacks before dinner, you know the rule. Why don’t you help me with the salad instead?” Agatha opened the refrigerator doors and began pulling out tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce.</p><p>“Pesto? That disgusting green goo?” He pouted. “I don’t like that.” He made an expression of disgust as she watched Agatha place the food on the counter.</p><p>Agatha sighed and scratched the bridge of her nose, missing those old good days when she would just plop him in the high chair and not have to negotiate every single meal. “Nicky, you ate pesto pasta last week at that restaurant, remember?” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“No, mom, that was something else. I don’t like peso.” Nicky said confidently. </p><p>“It’s pesto with a T.” She corrected him. “Fine, Nicky. What do you want?” She could have pressed further, determined to convince him that yes, he had eaten pesto pasta before and enjoyed it. But Agatha knew better. That discussion could take a long time, especially since she had given birth to a miniature version of herself. </p><p>Nicky thought for a moment, placing his fingers on his chin. “Steak! With mashed potatoes.” He replied excitedly with his eyes shining at Agatha.</p><p>If it were any other day, that look that only a child could muster would certainly convince her. However, thanks to Jen fucking Kale (yes, Agatha was still bitter about that), Rio would be having dinner with them that night. Vegetarian Rio.</p><p>“Nice try, kid. But no. Come help with the salad.” Agatha handed him a small child-safe knife and nudged the cutting board with cucumbers and tomatoes toward him. “Carefully, ok, baby?”</p><p>Nicky got busy enough with his chopping task that he forgot to fight the idea of dinner. Meanwhile, Agatha put some ingredients for the pesto pasta in the food processor. Nicky was humming a song when the doorbell rang.</p><p>A lot happened at once.</p><p>The sharp chime of the doorbell, the loud noise of a nut caught on the processor, and Nicky, who started running towards the door screaming, “I got it, I got it!”</p><p>“Nicky, wait!” Agatha called out, but either he didn’t hear her or chose to ignore her. “Damn it.” She left the kitchen island and walked toward the front door. By the time she reached it, Nicky had already swung it open, revealing Rio looking as hot as ever.</p><p>“Hi, Rio! I’m Nicholas.” He introduced himself, holding the door as he gave her a once-over. “My mom is making green goo. I hope you have already eaten.” He spoke shamelessly.</p><p>Agatha would have reprimanded him if she wasn’t busy staring at Rio. Or rather, at the way her pants hugged her legs and, undoubtedly, her ass. She wore a tank top that left little to the imagination, and it made Agatha speechless. Thank God for her chatty son. </p><p>“Hey, Nicholas. Oh, unfortunately I haven’t eaten yet. I guess we’re going to have to face this goo together, right?” Rio chuckled and crossed her fingers. Nicky burst out laughing, immediately turning to look at his mom as they both joked at her expense. </p><p>“See, mom? Not even Rio is too happy about your goo.” Nicky spoke.</p><p>Rio laughed again and looked for Agatha further into the house. A smile spread across her face when their eyes finally met. </p><p>“Hey, Agatha.” It was the first time that Rio said her first name, and the way she pronounced it, with an emphasis on the vowels, sent an unexpected shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“Hi, Rio. Come in.” She invited and Rio obeyed. Nicky scurried back to Agatha’s side, and she turned to him, “You, funny boy, go back to the kitchen and finish the salad.” As Nicky made his way back, Agatha turned to Rio, unsure of what to do. It felt strange having her in her home, and the heat rising up her neck didn't help.</p><p>“So, goo?” Rio questioned, arching an eyebrow. A playful smile was tugging at her lips, and Agatha had to fight the urge to stare at it.</p><p>“Pesto pasta. Nicky is not a fan of anything green.” Agatha explained, laughing softly. She nodded towards the kitchen. “It won’t take long and then we can start working.” Agatha turned and made her way back to the kitchen, with Rio following closely behind. </p><p>The rest of the dinner prep went smoothly, mostly because Nicky retreated to the living room after finishing the salad. While the women chatted about the university, dinner was ready. Soon, they were all gathered around the dinner table.</p><p>“This tastes awesome, Agatha. Who knew you could actually eat a proper meal.” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha laughed, and before she could answer, Nicky was looking suspiciously at the food in front of him. “Mom, are you sure this is the same thing? From the restaurant.” </p><p>“Yes, baby, I’m sure. Just try some and you’ll see.” She encouraged and watched as he tried the food.  </p><p>He chewed thoughtfully for a moment, then nodded, “Oh, right, I remember now. I like peso.” He said before diving into his meal.</p><p>Both women laughed. As they ate, they listened to Nicky’s non-stop chatter about his day at school. Surprisingly to Agatha, Rio had no trouble keeping the conversation going with Nicky. He was a smart kid, after all. </p><p>After they finished eating and put the dishes away, Agatha knelt down to Nicky’s level, and he looked at her with excited eyes. “Mom is going to work now, ok? Pick a movie and there’s a bag of candy on the couch.” She said as he was practically bouncing with anticipation, definitely looking forward to the movie night and the pile of candy that awaited him.</p><p>“Go easy on them, Nicky.” She warned, fully aware that it was a lost cause. She sighed as she watched him run to the living room and turn the TV on.</p><p>Rio was quiet watching the whole scene in front of her. The look on her face was very close to adoration.</p><p>“Shall we?” Agatha said and walked to her home office with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>A couple of hours later, Agatha was at her desk, fingers flying across the keyboard as she prepared her notes. Once in a while, she’d ask Rio a question, and they’d discuss it quickly before the office was quiet again. Fortunately, she was close to finishing everything she needed for the lecture. Calling Rio to work together turned out to be a great idea. Rio was not just sharp but also extremely dedicated, answering every question Agatha asked with effortless precision.</p><p>However, Agatha was getting even more exhausted. It was late enough that when she last checked on Nicky, he was deep asleep on the couch with ‘Soul’ playing in the background. She barely noticed when Rio called her name, and before she knew it, Rio was standing right beside her, the boundaries of personal space completely forgotten.</p><p>“I’m done with the visuals.” Rio said, leaning over the desk and placing her MacBook in front of Agatha. “I've gone over the remaining topics you mentioned, and the presentation is ready. I kept it brief to avoid overloading it, but let me know if you'd like any changes.” A woody, sweet scent filled Agatha’s nose, and she inclined slightly toward the smell. If she was closer than she needed to be, she pretended not to notice.</p><p>Rio was showing her the presentation, and Agatha bravely fought her instincts in order to pay attention to the screen. The scent of Rio’s perfume was intoxicating, and Rio was too close, and the tank top left little to the imagination as Rio’s breasts were at Agatha’s face level.</p><p>“It looks great, thank you.” Agatha’s voice was throaty, and she hoped that Rio would just return to her spot. It was becoming really hard to focus. Or to breathe properly, for that matter.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move. In fact, she leaned closer and turned her face to look at Agatha. “Can I help you with anything else?” Rio asked in a husky voice. By their proximity, her nose nearly brushed against Agatha’s.</p><p>“No.” Agatha replied quickly. How had she gone from a respectable professor to a blushing, needy mess? She had no clue.</p><p>Rio smiled. “Are you sure about that?” Rio’s face was so close that Agatha couldn’t focus on anything but those beautiful shades of brown. She knew she had to step back. She was the oldest, she was the professor, the one responsible for enforcing boundaries.</p><p>“Rio. Please.” She knew she couldn’t distance herself purely by willpower. She needed Rio to cooperate, to pull back, so that they could maintain their professional relationship. Hell, it wasn't even professional. Agatha was a professor and Rio a student, for fuck’s sake.</p><p>“Don’t need to beg.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>No, that definitely wasn’t what Agatha was implying. Not even close.</p><p>Before she could react and take the words back, Rio closed the distance.</p><p>Their lips met in a delicate kiss. She hadn’t said please to this, but the moment Rio’s lips touched hers, she may as well have. Agatha kissed her back and felt the younger woman's hands go straight to her hair.</p><p>Agatha tried to regain a shred of consciousness, but the pressure of Rio’s lips against hers, her scent, and the feel of one hand gently stroking her hair while the other rested on her neck… It was enough for Agatha to cave.</p><p>The kiss came to an abrupt end when Agatha got up from her chair and with her hand on Rio’s waist, she pressed her against the bookshelf. Rio was taken aback by Agatha's quick movement, but the older woman kissed her again with much greater urgency. Agatha deepened the kiss, her tongue touching Rio's lower lip, prompting her to open her mouth and allow entry. </p><p>Rio tasted better than she smelled, and that was saying a lot. Rio’s perfume was quickly becoming Agatha’s favorite scent.</p><p>Agatha effortlessly controlled the kiss, holding Rio's hips forcefully. The kiss was becoming increasingly messy, and Agatha needed to breathe, but she lacked the self-control to separate herself from Rio. Instead, she stroked Rio's hips and abdomen, who seemed to be melting into the kiss.</p><p>Rio had apparently been holding back until that moment, as she unexpectedly pulled Agatha's hair and ended the kiss. Agatha was breathing heavily, but the oxygen was rapidly expelled from her lungs again when Rio's lips started an attack on her neck.</p><p>The sound of a moan startled Agatha, and then she realized that it had come from her mouth. </p><p>“Rio, Rio–“ She spoke breathlessly, trying to get Rio's attention, who was nibbling and licking her neck with the same intensity. “Rio, stop.” She tried again, and the last word made Rio pause, her breath shallow. </p><p>Rio raised her face, revealing her flushed cheeks and swollen, reddened lips. Her hair was a tangled mess, a direct result of Agatha's tireless hands.</p><p>“You should go.” Agatha said, trying to catch her breath. She knew she didn’t look much better.</p><p>“W-what?” Rio’s voice trembled, a flicker of panic in her eyes.</p><p>“You should leave.” Agatha repeated. “My kid is sleeping next door, Rio. We shouldn’t have done this.” Agatha distanced herself from Rio, which turned her frustrated attempts to take a deep breath much easier.</p><p>“Don’t say that, Agatha. You called me here.” Rio said, as if establishing a fact while looking at Agatha, who was standing by the closed door.</p><p>“We had to work! On the lecture. I didn’t call you to do… This.” Agatha responded by pointing with her hands between them. The entire thing was swiftly escalating. </p><p>Rio let out an ironic laugh, shaking her head. “You’re joking, right? I see the way you look at me.” She stated. “How many women from the university have you invited to your house?” Her question hung in the air, daring Agatha to answer.</p><p>Agatha noticed the younger woman approaching, but she held her ground. “That’s not the point.” She deflected. The situation was not getting better, and Agatha became concerned that the back-and-forth would wake Nicky up. “Listen, we can’t discuss this here. I need you to leave.” Her voice was firmer than she felt. </p><p>In the blink of an eye, Rio was standing right in front of her, trapping her against the door. Agatha's breath caught. She knew Rio was bold but not insane. Like, clinically insane. She couldn't have that conversation with Nicky that close to them. Hell, she didn't want to have that conversation at all.</p><p>“Fine, Agatha, I’ll leave. But don’t you dare say we shouldn’t have done this. You’re not fooling anyone.” Rio said angrily and stepped closer until they were inches apart. </p><p>Agatha bit back the impulse to ask Rio to leave with a simple ‘please’. She knew better by now. Regardless, it wouldn’t have mattered because in the next moment, Rio was pulling her by the collar, closing the gap between them once again.</p><p>“Fuck you’re a good kisser.” Rio whispered with her lips pressed against Agatha’s, which made it close to impossible to hear. Almost like magic, Rio’s hand suddenly grabbed a handful of Agatha’s dark hair and pressed the professor’s head against hers.</p><p>The kiss was desperate, with tongues intertwining and Rio pressing Agatha against the door. Agatha knew she needed to stop it, because if it were up to Rio, she would have her way right there. If Nicky wasn’t home, maybe Agatha would’ve let her. She was fully aware how embarrassing wet she already was.</p><p>“Rio, I really need you to go. My son can wake up any second.” Agatha said, her hand resting on Rio’s waist keeping a safe distance between them.</p><p>Rio let out a slow sigh and nodded her head. “Ok, Agatha. I’m leaving.” She said and took a step back. Agatha took the opportunity to open the door, knowing that Rio wouldn't do anything crazy if Nicky was just a room away. Right?</p><p>Agatha waited for Rio to step out of the office before following her to the front door. As they passed through the living room, they noticed Nicky was sleeping soundly. </p><p>Agatha opened the door. “I’ll see you in the auditorium, Rio. Have a good night.” Undecided on what to do, she stood still.</p><p>“Good night, Agatha.” Rio bit her lip, and Agatha’s gaze was drawn to the movement before she could stop herself. Taking advantage of the distraction, Rio closed the distance in a heartbeat and crashed her lips against hers.</p><p>“Rio, Jesus fuck–“ Agatha muttered irritably. </p><p>Really, was Rio a fucking horny teenager? She was dangerously close to shoving Rio out the door.</p><p>Rio chuckled and shook her head, clearly amused. With one last glance at Agatha, she turned and walked out of the Harkness house.</p><p>Agatha spent more than five minutes leaning against her locked door (just in case), trying to steady her breathing. She considered calling Wanda in an absurd attempt for her friend to talk some sense into her. Because, really, what the hell was she thinking? She couldn’t get involved with a woman that much younger than her, let alone one who was a student at the university where she worked.</p><p>It was complete madness. What would she even say to Wanda? </p><p>(Hey, I apparently lost my mind. </p><p>Call child services.</p><p>I almost let her fuck me in my office with my son sleeping next door.</p><p>She’d have if I wanted to.</p><p>God, I wanted to.) </p><p>No, that conversation will not be happening. She won't be saying a word to Wanda. Or to anyone for that matter.</p><p>Agatha groaned as she made her way to the living room, turning off the TV and picking Nicky up. His arms instinctively wrapped around her neck as she carried him toward her room. He was getting too heavy to be carried like this, and the pain in her lower back was strong evidence of it. Agatha will certainly regret that the next day.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The day of the seminar started off weirdly calm. Agatha was supposed to have Nicky for the weekend, but she had swapped days with Paul to prepare for the event. He happily agreed, as he had tickets for some basketball game and was planning to ask Agatha if he could take Nicky.</p><p>Agatha hadn't spoken with Rio since the other night at her house. She had a full day of classes and meetings, which occupied both her mind and time. </p><p>She took her time taking a shower and drying her hair, making it less wild than usual. Agatha searched through her closet to find an outfit and ended up choosing a sophisticated monochrome beige look with a structured oversized blazer, wide-leg high-waisted pants, and a fitted turtleneck sweater. </p><p>It was chillier than usual, and with the auditorium’s air conditioning blasting at full power to accommodate the crowd, at least she wouldn’t have to worry about overheating.</p><p>She was in the kitchen pouring herself a cup of coffee when her phone beeped.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">apparently we have a full house today</p><p align="right">nervous?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arched her brow. They hadn’t exactly reached the stage of casually texting each other yet. Then again, considering she’d had her tongue in Rio’s mouth less than 48 hours ago, a text didn’t seem all that out of place.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness</strong>
</p><p>Not really.</p><p> </p><p>There. Short, direct. Her phone beeped again.</p><p> </p><p align="right" dir="ltr">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right" dir="ltr">can i see you before your lecture?</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness</strong>
</p><p>I don’t have the time.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed Rio got the message, as there were no more texts from her. Agatha eventually left her house, heading to the university.</p><p> </p><p>The green room was surprisingly calm, especially considering Jen called her nine times during her ten-minute drive to the campus. She wasn’t even remotely late. Quite the contrary, she had a full hour before her lecture, and the auditorium had only just opened its doors to let the public in.</p><p>“Agatha, the sound guy needs your flash drive with the presentation. Where is it?” Jen asked after they managed to convince Lilia to go to the auditorium and welcome the representatives from the other universities and the executive director of the Environmental Law Institute. </p><p>Fuck. Holy fucking shit. Agatha didn’t have it. Rio took it with her when she left her house that night. </p><p>“It’s in my purse in my office. I’ll go get it.” Agatha lied and strode off, barely registering Jen telling her to hurry.</p><p>As she walked, she repeatedly called Rio’s phone, but each attempt went straight to voicemail.</p><p>“Fuck! Now you don’t want to talk to me? Asshole.” Agatha muttered under her breath, her pace quickening out of sheer nervous energy since she knew there was no flash drive waiting for her in the office.</p><p>She turned down the hallway of the Criminal Justice department that led to her office when she came face to face with Rio Vidal leaning against her door, holding the flash drive.</p><p>“Looking for something?” Rio smiled wickedly.</p><p>Agatha ran a frustrated hand through her hair, which had been neatly styled earlier but now hung in messy strands from her rushed walk to the office. </p><p>“Hilarious.” She hissed. “What’s the matter with you? I need to get that to the auditorium right now.”</p><p>“Oh, so you do have the time to talk, after all.” Rio said, still holding the flash drive between her fingers even as Agatha extended her hand, waiting for it.</p><p>“This is barely a conversation, Rio. I’m serious. Give it to me.” Agatha said, her hand still extended. Rio, however, made no move to pass her the flash drive, and Agatha could feel her patience running out. </p><p>The situation didn't improve when her phone started ringing, obviously it was Jen demanding her return with the flash drive.</p><p>Rio also noticed Agatha’s phone ringing and raised an eyebrow. “I just need five minutes to talk to you, Agatha. Then you can go. With the flash drive.” Rio said. She gave a knock on the office door with her middle finger, signaling for Agatha to open it.</p><p>“You have to be fucking kidding with me. Christ–“ Agatha didn’t finish her sentence as she violently unlocked her office and marched inside the office. She stopped in the middle of the office and turned to Rio, who closed the door and looked at Agatha, clearly staring at her body.</p><p>“You look hot,” Rio bit her lower lip and smirked, still shamelessly looking at Agatha.</p><p>“Is that what you want to talk to me about? Seriously?” Agatha asked, incredulous at the other woman's audacity in manipulating her like that.</p><p>“God, Agatha, what’s up your ass today?” Rio shook her head, and Agatha immediately regretted not calling Wanda to advise her to call child services. She was so close to losing her mind that she was certain Nicky would be motherless by the end of the day.</p><p>“Oh, let me see.” Agatha paused dramatically. “I have a lecture to give in less than a hour and my whole presentation is hanging by a thread because of a fucking insane woman!” </p><p>“Don’t get all dramatic on me, Agatha.” Rio said, rolling her eyes. </p><p>But then Rio’s expression shifted, almost vulnerable. “Are you avoiding me?” Her voice softened, and Agatha was caught off guard by the change.</p><p>“Of course not. I’ve been busy, Rio.” She replied and took a deep breath. “Kale is freaking out about this seminar. I had to meet her and the Dean. That’s why I said I wouldn’t have enough time to talk to you.” She explained, ignoring her phone ringing again. </p><p>She had no intention of having to explain herself to Rio, but Rio's vulnerability compelled her to do so. </p><p>She had a soft spot for someone other than her kid, after all.</p><p>Rio took a few steps closer, bringing them within arm's reach of each other. Agatha’s choice of wearing a turtleneck sweater started looking like a very bad idea. She could feel the heat spreading across her chest.</p><p>“I hope you’re not lying, Agatha, because I felt like shit when you texted me this morning.” Rio said, her gaze softening as she approached the older woman.</p><p>“I’m not lying.” Agatha wasn’t exactly telling the truth, either, but she couldn’t afford pissing Rio off. Not when the flash drive she desperately needed was still in her hand. “Look, Rio, I really have to go.”</p><p>Rio glanced at the clock on the wall. “I still have two minutes with you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips were on hers in a heartbeat. </p><p>Agatha really needed to see a doctor because something wasn’t right. It couldn’t be normal the way her heart raced and her mind went blank every time she was kissing Rio. The usually composed woman was quickly turning into a mess, a pathetic puddle of need every time those lips were on hers.</p><p>This time wasn’t different.</p><p>Agatha brought her hand to the side of Rio’s face, almost as a gesture of tenderness. The image of Rio’s usually confident face becoming vulnerable still lingered in her mind. It seemed that Rio’s fragility vanished the second the kiss got heated, with Rio deepening the kiss, and she entered Agatha’s mouth at once.</p><p>Agatha's hair wouldn't come out unscathed, as Rio’s hands gripped her head, as if afraid that if she let go, Agatha would pull away. </p><p>Their mouths clashed against one another, their tongues dancing in a kiss that would not let them escape intact. Rio's hand left her hair and traveled lower, squeezing her boob beneath the blazer. Rio took Agatha's gasp as a sign to keep going. Suddenly, Rio's hands were everywhere. Her tits, ass, back of her neck.</p><p>A sharp noise, the door’s lock rattling violently, snapped them both out of their haze.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck? Open the door!” Jennifer’s voice boomed from the other side as both women tried to catch their breath. Agatha ran a hand through her disheveled clothes, trying to regain some semblance of composure.</p><p>Rio took the flash drive from her pocket and handed it to Agatha, distancing herself even further from the woman.</p><p>Agatha quickly placed the office key in Rio’s hand, her voice low but urgent. “There, go!” She gestured toward the far corner of the room. If the door didn't fully open, it would provide a hiding spot. Rio obeyed silently. </p><p>Agatha took one deep breath, cracking the door open just enough to step through. She came face to face with Jennifer, who was clearly very pissed. “I didn’t know where I had put it, but here it is,” she held up the flash drive. “Let’s go.”</p><p>-</p><p>The auditorium was indeed packed. She barely recognized most of the faces as she got up on stage with an impeccable posture and practiced smile. If she just had her tongue inside someone’s mouth and that someone had been grabbing her ass mere minutes ago, she didn’t show it.</p><p>“Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,” she announced and the auditorium instantly quieted. God, the power of standing before hundreds of people and commanding their attention with just her voice. “I’m Agatha Harkness, Doctor of Juridical Science with focus on Criminology.” </p><p>Behind her, the projector flickered to life, displaying a professional photo of her alongside an impressive list of her degrees. </p><p>“Before we begin, I’d like to express my gratitude to the School of the Environment for the opportunity to present this compelling and multifaceted case, which has recently sparked significant discussion in both the Criminal and Environmental sectors of our country.” </p><p>In her peripheral vision, a figure she had grown all too familiar with entered the auditorium, moving with effortless confidence. Even across distance, Agatha’s gaze locked onto Rio’s, and the knowing smile that curved on the younger woman's lips nearly disoriented her. With a quiet inhale, Agatha cleared her throat and forced her attention back to the audience.</p><p>“Shall we begin?” Her poised smile returned as she pressed the button on the projector remote. In a commanding presence and steady voice, Agatha started her lecture.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha Harkness had always taken pride in her intelligence and efforts. Her achievements were not only the result of outstanding memory and logical thinking but also of unwavering dedication through almost 30 years. Being recognized for her intellect was fulfilling, but what she valued most was the opportunity to demonstrate it. It was no surprise that she had chosen to become a professor at one of the most prestigious universities in the country.</p><p>When her lecture ended, the room erupted into a long round of applause. Inevitably, Agatha's gaze was drawn to Rio, who was clapping vigorously, her smile warm and her eyes filled with visible admiration. Agatha felt a smile tugging on her lips in response. </p><p>“We still have thirty minutes left. I’d be happy to address any questions you may have. Please raise your hand, and a member of our staff will bring the microphone to you.” </p><p>Some hands went up, as expected. While the said member walked through the rows to reach one of the individuals, Agatha seized the brief moment of pause to drink some water. </p><p>At the first sip of water, her throat felt scratchy, and she tried hard not to grimace. An hour and a half of uninterrupted speaking, combined with the direct blast of air conditioning, had definitely taken its toll on her. God, she hated being reminded that she wasn't getting any younger.</p><p>Agatha watched as a young man stood up and held the microphone. “Hi, Professor, nice to meet you. I’m Theo. In your opinion, what do you think was the biggest challenge in holding all those people accountable?”</p><p>“Hello, Theo.” That question was expected, thanks to Rio. They had discussed the possible questions that could be asked, and Rio had put together a long list and this one was at the top of it. </p><p>“Proving intent or willful negligence. Many officials and agencies were involved in the decision-making process, and the bureaucratic complexity made it hard to figure out who was legally responsible.” She paused for a moment. “On top of that, several high-ranking officials claimed ignorance, and immunity protections only made accountability more difficult to achieve.” </p><p>The answer was enough as Theo nodded his head and murmured a thank you before sitting back on his chair. </p><p>Agatha sipped her water again and winced due to the scratchiness in her throat. </p><p>Less than a minute later, a blonde woman, probably in her mid-thirties, cleared her throat into the microphone to get Agatha’s attention, as if Agatha wasn't already watching the microphone’s movement as it passed through the audience. </p><p>“Such a pleasure to meet you, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha made an effort not to frown when called by her first name. It wasn't common, especially in professional academic environments. She remained silent, waiting for the woman’s question.</p><p>“I’m Dr. Danvers, Professor in Environmental Science and Engineering at Salem University,” The woman proudly said into the microphone, “I’m interested in hearing your insights on whether corporate entities or contractors involved in this case could have faced criminal liability.” </p><p>Not a question, but whatever. Agatha didn’t hesitate. “If there was enough evidence to indicate they knowingly provided flawed advice, falsified data, or failed to follow regulatory standards, then yes, they could have faced criminal liability.”</p><p>“Well, you just mentioned the legal hurdles involved in this case, and, as we know, none of the individuals in power have faced criminal penalties for their actions. What do you have to say about that?” </p><p>Was that woman trying to get into politics with her in front of hundreds of people? The atmosphere in the auditorium shifted as a few seconds passed by. It was not a smart move to criticize government agencies of negligence, especially considering a lot of them funded her research and extension projects at the university.</p><p>“It is not uncommon for environmental cases to be resolved through civil settlements rather than criminal charges.” At that moment, quiet murmurs and frustrated grumbles rippled through the audience. Agatha quickly continued, “I’m not saying whether it’s fair or not, that’s not up to me. We must understand the law so we can navigate through it and use it to drive changes. Make sure it doesn’t happen again. Make sure environmental policies are enforced.”</p><p>They seemed pleased with the response, and Agatha even heard a few "yeah" from the audience. She was uncapping her water bottle, thinking she had a few seconds until the next question, when Dr. Danvers’ voice echoed across the room again.</p><p>“You’re absolutely right. Thank you, Agatha. That was brilliant. All of it.” The blonde woman flashed a bright smile, and Agatha smiled back, thankful for the praise.</p><p>The next few questions seemed to have been taken straight from Rio's list, and Agatha made a mental note to thank her later. When the 30-minute question session was over, Agatha wrapped up and expressed gratitude once more before leaving the stage to a round of applause.</p><p> </p><p>She had barely stepped off the stage when she found herself surrounded by familiar faces. Jennifer, Lilia, Wanda. And Rio. Shit. </p><p>She smiled, accepting their praises, though she barely had time to process them before Lilia gently took her by the arm. </p><p>“Agatha, you were incredible! Well done. I knew I could count on you,” the Dean said, her smile wider than Agatha had ever seen. “I hope you’re not busy tonight. All seven representatives and the executive director are joining us tonight at a restaurant downtown. They are utterly impressed with you and this seminar!”</p><p>Although Agatha was pleased with the success of her lecture, the thought of spending hours making small talk with doctors in the environmental field wasn’t particularly appealing. However, with four pairs of eyes fixed on her, she couldn’t come up with an excuse quickly enough. “Oh, thank you… Yeah, sure. Just text me the address.” </p><p>Who knows, maybe she could come up with an excellent excuse until the event?</p><p>Jennifer’s smile looked practically permanent, as if her cheeks were stuck in place. As expected, she simply muttered a quick thank you to Agatha before leaving with Lilia to join the honored guests.</p><p>Then, there were only Agatha, Wanda, and Rio left. </p><p>Awkward. </p><p>Thankfully, Wanda spoke first. “Wow Agatha, I had no idea you were so deep in environmental issues. Remind me to call you next time I’m debating whether to toss something in the recycling or the regular trash.” </p><p>Agatha glared at both women as they laughed.</p><p>Before their bickering could escalate, a familiar blonde appeared beside them. How on earth she had managed to slip backstage was beyond Agatha as she looked at the blonde, confused.</p><p>“Agatha, I was hoping to find you here.” Oh, right. Dr. Danvers. Doctor of something somewhere. Something related to nature. Or was it engineering?</p><p>“Yes, Dr. Danvers? Is there anything you’d like to ask? Or add?” Agatha kept her tone professional, deliberately ignoring the burning stare from Rio.</p><p>“Please, call me Carol.” The blonde flashed her brightest smile. “Your lecture was… Mesmerizing, truly. You have such a way with words. I would love to have you as a speaker at Salem University sometime. What do you think?”</p><p>Agatha returned the smile, though hers was far more measured. “Thank you, Carol. We can discuss it further, surely. Feel free to send me the details.” Agatha said, keeping her tone polite. </p><p>She averted her gaze to Wanda, who was watching the exchange with a subtle smirk. Rio, on the other hand, looked at Agatha with a sharp and piercing look, almost predatory. The two women's expressions were so contrasting that it was almost laughable.</p><p>“Gladly. Just give me your number so we can discuss the specifics more conveniently,” the blonde woman smirked and handed Agatha her phone.</p><p>Wow. Very subtle. Especially considering Agatha had made her email available during the presentation, encouraging anyone with further questions to reach out that way.</p><p>“Um– sure,” feeling extremely uncomfortable, Agatha took the blonde’s phone and quickly saved her contact.</p><p>The wrath on Rio’s face did not go unnoticed.</p><p>Carol slipped her phone in her purse, and for the first time, she turned her attention to the other two women. “I’ll leave you to your friends. See you tonight, Agatha.” With that, the blonde left just as she had entered.</p><p>Wanda's eyes widened, and she began giggling, particularly at Agatha's incredulous expression. “Oh my God! What the hell was that? You’re meeting her at the restaurant tonight?” Even though Wanda was the only one laughing among the three, she didn't notice or didn't care.</p><p>“I guess Lilia invited her.” Agatha answered, looking between them. Rio hadn’t said a word since she met her after the lecture, and Agatha wasn't used to Rio being strangely quiet. She definitely preferred the communicative and teasing version. </p><p>“Lucky you to have your place for yourself then.” Wanda commented, eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>If Rio’s expression was sour before, it deepened into something even worse. </p><p>“I’m going to ignore that,” Agatha grumbled, “I’m tired and my throat is killing me. I’m heading home.” </p><p>She fished for her car keys in her bag, grimacing at the ache pulsing in her head.</p><p>"You are no fun. Don't forget our brunch tomorrow." Wanda remarked before heading to the exit, leaving Agatha and Rio alone.</p><p>Agatha really looked at Rio for the first time since all those women cornered her after her lecture. She did not look happy. At all.</p><p>“Look, Rio, I’m exhausted. I just want to go home and crash.” Agatha muttered, rubbing her temples. Her couch seemed like a fever dream by now.</p><p>“I won’t keep you, Agatha. Can I walk you to your car?” Rio offered.</p><p>Agatha nodded and they walked silently towards the parking lot.</p><p> </p><p>The energy was palpable as the two walked together, keeping their distance across the empty campus. Was Rio jealous? Mad? Annoyed? Rio couldn’t be feeling all these things just because of a stupid interaction between Agatha and another woman. They weren’t an item. Hell, they’ve only made out a few times. Rio couldn’t be that possessive.</p><p>As they approached her car, the only one left in the parking lot besides Rio’s, Agatha unlocked it. Before she could say anything, Rio swiftly walked around and slipped into the passenger seat.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked from outside her car. When Rio didn’t respond, she let out a sigh and got in.</p><p>“Rio, what the hell?”</p><p>Rio almost jumped on Agatha, grabbing her sweater and crashing her lips against hers in a desperate kiss. Just like before in the office, Rio didn’t dance around and shoved her tongue inside Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“I barely got you,” Rio murmured between kisses, her voice low and possessive. “I’m not sharing you, Agatha.” Her words were final. It was a statement. A chill ran up Agatha's spine.</p><p>“I’m not yours, Rio.” Agatha replied, panting.</p><p>“You’re about to be. Take me to your house.”</p><p>-</p><p>Maybe she was having a seizure. Or a stroke. A severe allergic reaction to water? Carbon monoxide poisoning because she was twenty days overdue for her car's annual checkup?</p><p>None of those seemed good enough to justify why she was driving home. With Rio. With Rio's hand on her thigh, the tips of her fingers doing wonders for Agatha.</p><p>She needed a distraction. Anything to take her mind off this absurd situation. She should not be taking Rio to her house. She was supposed to be stronger than this… But was she? </p><p>Agatha tapped the dashboard screen, letting her Spotify shuffle through songs at random. As a sick twisted joke, the first notes of Sailor Song by Gigi Perez filled the car.</p><p>She refused to give Rio the satisfaction of changing to another song.  </p><p>
<em> ‘Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor? </em>
</p><p>
<em> And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?’ </em>
</p><p>Maybe she should have.</p><p>Rio pinched her thigh, and the combination of the song’s lyrics and Rio’s touch made Agatha shift uncomfortably in her seat. Yeah, so much for being better than a horny teenager. </p><p>
<em>‘She took my fingers to her mouth</em>
</p><p>
<em> The kind of thing that makes you proud’ </em>
</p><p>Agatha sharply turned the steering wheel in her garage and got out of the car. She didn’t wait for Rio before unlocking her front door and entering her home. Rio followed so closely that when Agatha turned to shut the door, they nearly collided. They stared at each other for a few seconds.</p><p>What? Has Rio suddenly gotten timid?</p><p>Agatha didn’t move because she definitely wouldn’t be the one to initiate this. She couldn’t be. But that didn’t mean she’d stand still forever waiting for Rio to grow a pair.</p><p>“Are you going to make me wait? You wanted to come. Now do something about it.” </p><p>That did it.</p><p>Rio was on her in a heartbeat.</p><p>They collided in an urgent kiss. Rio pushed her towards the living room, while Agatha struggled to direct her to the stairs. They tripped over numerous objects on the floor while kissing, including pairs of shoes, plant pots, and a coat hanger.</p><p>Agatha's blazer lay forgotten on the floor as Rio guided her backward toward the couch, fingers deftly working at her belt. In one swift motion, Rio pulled Agatha’s sweater over her head, and Agatha was just as desperate. Rio’s cardigan fell to the floor, quickly followed by the shirt beneath it. Of course she wasn’t wearing a bra.</p><p>Agatha was becoming annoyed with Rio's insistence on taking her to the living room. Agatha was too sober and self-conscious to fuck her on the same surface she watched cartoons with her child. Yep, not happening.</p><p>“I’m fucking forty-six. We’re not doing this in my living room. Upstairs, now.” She grumbled as Rio's teeth grazed over her collarbone, biting hard and soothing it with her tongue. Her grip was tight on Agatha’s breast through the fabric of her bra. The urgency in her touch made it clear that whatever restraint she had was slipping quickly.</p><p>Rio still didn’t move. On the contrary, she started unbuttoning Agatha's pants, and before she could drag them down, Agatha's hand that was on the back of her head slid to her neck, forcing her to look at the older woman while her thumb and middle finger squeezed Rio's neck.</p><p>“I. Said. Upstairs.” Agatha’s voice laced with both lust and impatience, a combination that sent a visible shiver through Rio.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re gonna be the death of me.” Rio said breathlessly when Agatha let go of her neck so they could go to her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Once inside, Rio didn’t hesitate like she had moments ago. She was determined to show Agatha that she wouldn’t keep her waiting any longer. With a firm push, she sent Agatha tumbling onto the bed.</p><p>Agatha fell back onto the mattress and propped herself up on her elbows, watching Rio take off her own clothes until she was only in her underwear. When Rio realized the spectacle she was unconsciously putting on for Agatha, she smiled mischievously and climbed onto the bed, straddling her.</p><p>“I get so turned on when you’re bossy.”</p><p>“Must be wet all the time when you’re around me, then.” Agatha smiled and stretched her neck, capturing Rio's lips once again. </p><p>“You tell me,” Rio answered between sloppy kisses and guided Agatha’s hand to her own underwear. She was dripping.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio.” Agatha was so close to combusting that she barely held herself together as desire consumed her.</p><p>Agatha, still underneath Rio, moved her soaked underwear to the side and entered her with two fingers. No warning. Rio's scream was worth it, and Rio craned her neck back, closing her eyes as Agatha tried to make the best use of her position to continue moving her fingers in and out of the younger woman's cunt.</p><p>That position was not the most convenient considering how tough she wanted to fuck Rio. So, she grabbed Rio's hip, and in a swift motion, they reversed positions.</p><p>With Rio lying on her back on the bed, Agatha climbed on top of her and pulled Rio’s underwear down her legs. She put her fingers in Rio's pussy again, just like before, but now much stronger and faster. </p><p>Rio's moans were low, restrained. </p><p>No. Agatha won’t have that.</p><p>“I want to hear you.” Agatha said before a particularly hard thrust.</p><p>“I want to fucking hear you moan my name.”</p><p>Agatha added a third finger and the moans that followed were music to her ears. Any lingering doubts about what was happening faded away, until the only thing occupying Agatha’s mind was the sound of Rio’s loud moans.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, yes—“ Rio managed to whimper, her fingers clutching the sheets so tightly that the sound of fabric straining was audible. </p><p>Agatha tilted her body higher, and her lips captured Rio's nipple. Her tongue moved in circles around the nipple before sucking it, repeating the process while relentlessly thrusting in and out of Rio's pussy. </p><p>“I—I’m gonna cum—Shit.” </p><p>She could feel how Rio’s cunt was pulsing. Her lips left Rio's nipple and moved closer to her ear. “You’re cumming when I say-so.”</p><p>She traced the tip of her tongue over every inch of Rio’s skin, slow and deliberate, until she reached exactly where she was needed most. Agatha knew she wouldn't have much time to tease her considering the way Rio was babbling a mix of curses and Agatha’s name like a prayer.</p><p>“You’ll cum in my mouth while I fuck you with my fingers.” Agatha said it as an order, and she licked the entire length of Rio's pussy. Rio didn't moan. She let out a cry.</p><p>Agatha started eating her out with the same unrelenting rhythm that she fucked Rio. It didn’t take long for her to feel Rio shaking beneath her as an orgasm coursed through her body. </p><p>“Fuck—ohmygod—Agatha please don’t stop—Fuck!”</p><p>Rio’s orgasmic moans were her new favorite sound. That’s why she didn’t stop fucking her with her fingers when she moved her head way from Rio’s pussy. She felt her cheeks and chin wet with Rio’s arousal and release.</p><p>“Agatha, please-please– wait!”</p><p>Rio was pretty close to convulsing on the bed.</p><p>“I didn’t say I was done with you, did I?” Agatha was determined to get revenge for every moment she felt uncomfortable or aroused in completely inappropriate places. In inappropriate situations. All because of Rio. </p><p>She withdrew her fingers.</p><p>“Turn over.”</p><p>She smirked when Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She turned on her stomach on the bed, and with a tug from Agatha on her hip, Rio was on all fours on the mattress.</p><p>“You’re fucking dripping, Rio,” she said when she noticed drops of arousal on the sheet and running down the younger woman's leg.</p><p>“Please, Agatha, please.” If there was one thing Agatha loved most in this world, it was a hot woman begging for her. And who was she to deny such a request?</p><p>Kneeling on the mattress, Agatha bit and sucked Rio's back, feeling her hair stand on end with the contact while her hands caressed and squeezed her ass. Her hand slid from her ass to her entrance, and without hesitation, she entered her with three fingers. Rio cursed under her breath at the intrusion, but when Agatha considered removing one of her fingers, Rio spread her legs wider and stuck her ass out, encouraging Agatha to fuck her even harder.</p><p>Fuck, Agatha could do this forever.</p><p>Apparently not Rio, since she was already moaning loudly and holding onto the pillows to withstand the force with which Agatha was fucking her.</p><p>“F—Fuck, Agatha—Harder.”</p><p>A dull ache started to creep into Agatha’s right shoulder, a clear consequence of repeating the same motion for who knows how long, but she was determined to make Rio cum one more time, so she reached between Rio's legs to massage her clit. Not exactly fair play, but oh well.</p><p>“God—God, fuck, Agatha, fuck—fuck!” Rio screamed, her cunt squeezing Agatha's fingers, who reduced the force with which she was thrusting into Rio. Her other hand made circular movements on her clit, in the same way her tongue had done a few moments ago, and apparently she had discovered Rio's little secret.</p><p>Rio's entire body shook as a second orgasm coursed through her, amidst moans and the wet sounds of Agatha's fingers moving in and out of Rio's pussy.</p><p>Agatha helped her through the orgasm, and when Rio's legs trembled, making her lie flat on the mattress again, Agatha could do nothing but admire her sweaty and utterly spent body.</p><p>Fifteen seconds passed by. Then thirty. </p><p>“Rio?” Had Rio fallen asleep? Agatha began to worry because the younger woman had not moved since. Her ego was already plenty inflated without the added satisfaction of having utterly worn out a younger woman (however many years her junior) until she passed out. </p><p>Speaking of that…</p><p>After Rio responded with a vague hum, Agatha asked, “How old are you?”</p><p>Rio turned her face, still resting on the pillow, towards Agatha. “Are you seriously asking me that? Like, right now?”</p><p>“Never too late. I mean, you must be, at least, in your mid-twenties, right?” God, Agatha really hoped she was aiming low.</p><p>“I’m twenty-eight, Agatha. No need to freak out,” Rio smiled, lifting her head from the pillow to turn around in bed. Agatha was lying on her side, with her body facing Rio.</p><p>“I’m not freaking out.” </p><p>“Hmm, seems like you are. Are you worried you can’t keep up with my stamina?” Rio's flirty smile returned, but her eyes burned with hunger.</p><p>“Do I have to recall what just happened here?” </p><p>Apparently not, since Rio was on top of her in the next second, crashing their lips together. Rio moaned when she tasted herself on Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>When the kiss ended so they could catch their breath, Rio unceremoniously pulled down her pants and panties in one swift movement, and it was possible to see the exact moment she realized how wet Agatha was. Her lips formed a mischievous smirk, and she placed a hand on each of Agatha's inner thighs, which were extremely damp.</p><p>“You’re so fucking hot,” Rio whispered, fully thrilled to have Agatha laying bare beneath her.</p><p>Contrary to the hunger in Rio’s gaze, she didn’t seem to be in a rush. Her eyes traveled leisurely over Agatha’s body, lingering on every inch of exposed skin with an almost reverent appreciation. The intensity of it made Agatha shift, unsettled.</p><p>She was plenty confident, thank you very much. But having a woman eighteen years younger, straddling her, studying every freckle with deliberate patience, was starting to make Agatha uneasy.</p><p>Before she could say something filthy to get Rio to move, Rio leaned over. </p><p>Agatha craned her neck and bit Rio's lower lip to initiate a kiss, but Rio pulled away again and whispered, "I wanna taste you."</p><p>Finally something she could work on. Agatha merely nodded (a little more desperate than she’d admit), and Rio started kissing her neck and moved lower. </p><p>However, Rio became distracted when she reached Agatha's boobs. Capturing a nipple in her mouth, she lightly scraped her teeth on the nipple until she sucked it, and the other hand gave the same attention to the other.</p><p>Agatha moaned. Her nipples were highly sensitive and seemed to send a direct message to her cunt, which at that point was clutching around nothing. Her breathing began to become labored, and she shifted on the bed in an attempt to create some friction, but to no avail.</p><p>Rio noticed Agatha's uneasiness, but her mouth didn't stop working on her chest. Now, she paid the same attention to the entire area, sucking and nibbling all around her tits and collarbone. She slid her hand to Agatha’s pussy and began to press her clit. A heat pool formed in Agatha's stomach, and a feeling of desperation began to form in her body.</p><p>Under no circumstances would she cum just with the pressure of two of Rio's fingers.</p><p>Her pride couldn’t take that much of a hit. Agatha opened her eyes, her gaze fixing on the ceiling of her room. Amidst panting breaths and quiet moans, she focused every ounce of willpower to keep her body from betraying her.</p><p>Rio spent a few more seconds to be satisfied with the artwork she had created across Agatha's skin. Rio stood on her heels and bit her lip, looking down at Agatha's pussy, which seemed to vibrate. She looked like an animal about to devour its prey, and Agatha, once again, almost came with just the view.</p><p>Agatha, still attempting to stay focused, felt her entire effort evaporate the minute Rio placed her tongue against her clit and sucked.</p><p>Agatha's orgasm was as quick as the time it took her to cum. Her high-pitched moan vibrated in her throat as she lifted her hips, and in a still shaky state, Rio pulled away, clearly surprised at what had happened.</p><p>Agatha felt her face heat. Not because they had been fucking since they arrived at her house, not because of orgasm, but because of embarrassment. She had never cum so fast in her life. In fact, she prided herself on always being able to make her partners cum several times before she did, because her self-control was that good.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, did not brag about making her cum in less than two minutes, and she used the wetness on Agatha's pussy to enter two fingers. </p><p>Agatha's moans grew louder as Rio became bolder: when she pressed a hand on Agatha's lower stomach while fucking her, when she placed Agatha on her lap and told her to sit on her three fingers, and when she convinced Agatha to sit on her face so she could eat her out and didn't seem to mind when, after one of many orgasms, Rio's face dripped with Agatha's release.</p><p> </p><p>A loud noise erupted in the house. A song. Somewhere in the living room. </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, and in the brief moments that her eyes adjusted to the darkness, her brain tried to make sense of the sound that reached her ears. </p><p>First of all, it wasn't supposed to be that dark.</p><p>She lifted her head from the pillow, strands of hair still clinging to the side of her face. Her gaze swept across the bed until it landed on a naked figure, lying face down, completely still.</p><p>How the fuck did she end up sleeping? She barely remembered her last orgasm. But she definitely remembered telling Rio she was too exhausted for anything else. The last thing she recalled was her body giving out before her brain could even register it, collapsing onto the bed in sheer exhaustion. </p><p>Rio didn't look much better than her either, but Agatha certainly didn't expect to wake up to her fucking sleeping in her bed.</p><p>“Rio,” she tried, gently poking her back. Nothing.</p><p>“Rio, wake up.”</p><p>The same sound as before began to reinvigorate throughout the house. Muttering curses under her breath, Agatha got up, grabbed the sheet that had been tossed onto the floor, and wrapped it around herself before stepping out of the bedroom in search of her phone.</p><p>Her purse was on the table near the front door. Agatha grabbed it, pulled out her phone, and answered the call before even checking the caller ID.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Harkness? Is everything alright with you?” She detected Lilia’s voice, and dread took over her body. </p><p>Fuck. She had slept through dinner. Or… maybe not? She had no idea what time it was, let alone how long she and Rio had been fucking. And then sleeping.</p><p>“Lilia, I was about to call you right now,” Agatha’s voice came out hoarse, her throat feeling like it had endured five seasons of drought without so much as a single drop of water.</p><p>“Oh dear, you don’t sound very good. I was worried. We arrived at the restaurant thirty minutes ago, and we were expecting you.” Lilia’s voice held genuine concern as Agatha made her way into the living room, her legs still slightly trembling as she collapsed onto the couch.</p><p>““I’m so sorry. I took a pill after the lecture, and it probably made me sleepy. I don't even remember falling asleep.” It wasn't entirely a lie. Not the last part, at least.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Harkness. Are you feeling better now? Dr. Danvers suggested picking you up at your home. She can go now, actually—“</p><p>“NO!" Agatha’s voice came out far too loud for her sore throat, and she immediately coughed. If her throat hadn’t been bad earlier, hours of moaning Rio’s name had certainly taken their toll, making every word feel like nails on a chalkboard. “I mean... I might be coming down with something. I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“No problem, Harkness. Dr. Danvers wishes you well."</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha replied and hung up the call.</p><p>She placed a hand on her throat, trying to massage away the discomfort, but only found it getting worse. She stood up from the couch, heading towards the bathroom when she spotted Rio standing at the bottom of the stairs, fully dressed. Her hair looked less wild, but she could see that Rio had tried her best to contain the frizz and undo the knots that Agatha's hands had made.</p><p>“I wondered if you’d died.” Agatha said in a hoarse voice. </p><p>“Me too. Many times I thought I was in heaven." Rio smiled, her gaze traveling shamelessly over Agatha's bare body, which was poorly wrapped in the sheet. One of her legs was entirely exposed, as was her abdomen and a portion of her chest.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled the same.</p><p>“I'm sorry for making you miss your fancy dinner,” Rio said and walked towards Agatha. If the smile on her lips was any indication, she wasn’t sorry at all. "Were you supposed to meet someone important there?” She slightly turned her head and tilted her eyebrow as she reached out her hand to play with one of the strands of Agatha's hair.</p><p>“You’re so full of shit, you know that?” Agatha responded, but her laugh, or more like an attempt at a laugh, was quickly interrupted by a fit of coughing. She spun around quickly to avoid coughing directly in Rio's face, and Rio placed her hand on her back, stroking her.</p><p>“Hey, what’s wrong? You don’t sound okay.”</p><p>It was the second person saying that to her in less than fifteen minutes, and Agatha began to believe it.</p><p>“My throat is killing me,” Agatha replied. When the coughing had stopped, she turned back to Rio. “I’ll take some pills and sleep it off. Do you need a ride to your car or your place?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to come off as dismissive, but a mix of exhaustion, soreness in places she hadn’t felt in years, and the raw pain in her throat made her feel like all she wanted was to crawl back into bed and sleep until tomorrow.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to mind. “I’ll take an Uber.” </p><p>“Sure? I don’t mind.”</p><p>“Yeah, you should rest. But, before I go—” Rio didn't finish the sentence and placed her lips on Agatha's. The kiss was completely opposite to those that afternoon. It was calm, unworried, and strangely affectionate.</p><p>“Te veo,” Rio said, and with another peck on Agatha's still swollen lips, she headed towards the door.</p><p>A few seconds later, the door opened and closed, leaving Agatha completely alone.</p><p>She could’ve used the quiet to sort through the chaos of what the hell had happened since she woke up that morning. </p><p>But honestly? She was too drained to even think about it.</p><p>Before having a shower, she took anti-inflammatory and muscle pain pills and a throat syrup. She didn't linger, not even looking in the mirror, as she entered and exited the shower stall.</p><p>When she lay down on the bed, she became aware that the room smelled strongly of sex and a blend of Rio and Agatha's scents. She deliberately chose the pillow Rio had laid on, and it smelled like her. Agatha told herself it was just a coincidence, and once again, her body blacked out.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was barely Sunday morning when Agatha's eyes fluttered open for the first time. She had no idea what time it was, but with only the faintest hint of sunlight creeping through her window, she guessed it was somewhere around 6:30 am. </p><p>Even though all her muscles complained when she sat up in bed, her brain was on full alert. Flashes flooded her thoughts as she looked over several specific parts of the bed, remembering all the positions Rio had fucked her senseless in.</p><p>The room still smelled so much of sex that Agatha got up to open her windows and went back under the covers. It was too early to deal with that. </p><p>Agatha grabbed a book from her nightstand, the same one that had probably been stuck on the same page since before the semester started. After less than ten pages, she had already fallen asleep again.</p><p> </p><p>The second time Agatha opened her eyes, it was because of that same fucking noise from the day before. She really needed to change that ringtone. Groaning, she reached for her phone and saw Wanda’s name flashing on the screen.</p><p>“What, Wanda?” Her voice was hoarse.</p><p>“Are you sleeping? Agatha, I’m outside. Brunch, remember?” No, Agatha definitely did not remember it.</p><p>“Fuck, sorry. Ten seconds,” she said, getting up way too fast. Her vision was spotted with black dots, and for a split second, she was sure she was about to faint. </p><p>What time had she last eaten? Had she even had a meal yesterday? </p><p>Not that she could remember. </p><p>Agatha took so long to find and slip into her floral robe that by the time she even considered checking the state of her face and hair, Wanda was already calling again.</p><p>“Just wait a fucking minute!” She yelled from the staircase, taking her time to finally answer the door. Soon afterwards she wishes she hadn’t.</p><p>“Dear God, what happened to you?”</p><p>Ok, she mustn’t be that bad. Right?</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked, waiting for Wanda to step inside so she could close the door.</p><p>Wanda stepped into the house as if walking onto a crime scene: cautious and silent steps, wide eyes looking for the victim while assessing the evidence. And in this case, the evidence was everywhere. Dirt from a fallen vase was scattered across the floor, shoes lay haphazardly as if they had been kicked off carelessly, and the coat hanger was tipped over, three jackets strewn around.</p><p>“Agatha, what the hell happened here?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced as she realized what a mess she and Rio had caused the day before. She was too tired to notice it yesterday and too lazy to come downstairs today. Fuck.</p><p>“Um— It’s a funny story, actually,” Agatha answered, racking her brain for an answer that never came. Double fuck.</p><p>“I’m waiting.”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms, still assessing the mess around them.</p><p>“I just really need to use the restroom first.” Agatha said, trying to buy herself a few extra minutes. Her half-asleep brain desperately needed time to function properly and come up with a decent excuse for why her house looked like it had been burgled. </p><p>“I’ll make us some coffee while you get ready.”</p><p>“How about we just order breakfast here?” Agatha suggested. “I’m still not feeling great. And I know that bakery you love does delivery.”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes at her but didn’t press it further. “Alright, go change. I'll order us something. Our friendship isn’t strong enough for me to endure brunch with you naked under this thing.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Agatha laughed, as her sore throat let her, and went upstairs again. </p><p>When Agatha entered the bathroom and looked in the mirror, she had to bite her lip to keep from shouting angrily. Her neck, from the base near her ears to her collarbone and even her breasts, was covered in fucking hickeys. Different shades blended together, blue, purple, red. A fucking rainbow painted across her pale skin.</p><p>She was going to kill Rio. </p><p>She violently snatched her phone from the bed.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness</strong>
</p><p>Just looked myself at the mirror.</p><p>How old are you?</p><p>I need to fucking work tomorrow!!</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">good morning, my lady</p><p align="right">i thought we went through this yesterday (?)</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated the pet name the same amount she was hating Rio Vidal that moment.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness</strong>
</p><p>Don’t play stupid.</p><p>I can’t believe you fucking did this.</p><p>What’s next? Going to pee on me?</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">is this a kink of yours?</p><p align="right">it’s not really my thing but if you ask nicely…</p><p> </p><p>Yes, she was going to beat that weird-ass hippie with a stick so long she’d never be able to hug a fucking tree again without remembering Agatha’s wrath. </p><p>Agatha plugged her phone in to charge in the bathroom before going to her closet to look for clothes that definitely didn't suit the weather. She eventually settled on a long-sleeved turtleneck sweater (she later noticed round purple marks on her arms that were caused by Rio’s fingers), swapped into sweatpants, and headed back downstairs.</p><p>Wanda was in her kitchen pouring coffee in two mugs when Agatha reached the kitchen island. </p><p>Wanda pointed at Agatha and then the foyer.</p><p>“So? Are you going to tell me what the hell happened to you? And this house? The last time I saw this level of chaos was when Nicky was born, and you could barely shower because he wouldn’t let you breathe for a second.”</p><p>Agatha reached for her coffee and contemplated just lying. A big fat lie. It would be easier to tell Wanda that she met some stranger last night, had one too many drinks, and took her home. That would explain the mess. It would explain the hickeys.</p><p>But deep down, Agatha knew the truth wouldn’t stay hidden for long. The moment Wanda saw her and Rio together, she’d know. She always did.</p><p>“I was with someone last night.”</p><p>“No shit. I figured that, Agatha,” Wanda scoffed, rolling her eyes as Agatha had called her stupid. “But I’m relieved to hear it was a person. In the state you’re in, I would’ve believed you if you said you got mauled by a dog.”</p><p>Before Agatha could ignore her and tell her what had happened after Wanda left the auditorium, the redhead exclaimed, “Oh my God, Agatha, you dog! You slept with that arrogant blonde?!”</p><p>“No! Jesus, Wanda, I have some self-respect.”</p><p>Wanda arched her brow in obvious judgment, as if to imply that if Agatha honestly had all the self-respect she claimed, she wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.</p><p>“I fucked Rio.”</p><p>“What? How?—“ She quickly corrected, “I mean, I don’t want to know how, thank you. But— Holy shit, Agatha!” </p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee, waiting for the moment Wanda fully processed the situation. Considering she herself hadn’t completely wrapped her head around everything that had happened the day before, she figured Wanda was entitled to a few seconds of freaking out. </p><p>“You, Agatha Harkness, fucked a student?” Wanda deliberately enunciated each word just to make sure. </p><p>Agatha had always taken pride in keeping a firm boundary between herself and her students, even those in her extension project, whom she mentored throughout the academic year. So, Wanda’s shock was justified. </p><p>“I don’t know why you’re acting so surprised. I mean, I told you about her.” </p><p>“You said she was different. And bold. Not that you were planning to fuck her.”</p><p>“I wasn’t! She got a little too territorial because of your little stunt yesterday.”</p><p>Wanda glanced at her, confused, but before she could respond, the doorbell rang, delivering the food. The redhead went to pick it up and came back with four large paper bags.</p><p>“How many people did you think you’d find here?” Agatha asked as she noticed all the containers being pulled from the bags, a variety of breakfast treats such as French toast, scrambled eggs, pancakes, waffles, quiches, and other dishes she couldn’t even recognize.</p><p>“Well, I’m hungry, and since you won’t go out and you don’t cook when Nicky isn’t here, I’m not taking any chances.” Wanda said as they both set the food down on the table and gathered the utensils they’d need. “Go back. What do you mean by stunt? I didn’t even talk to her yesterday. She was so quiet. Very different from what you described.”</p><p>“You implied I was going to sleep with Dr. Danvers!”</p><p>“So? Why would she care? It’s not like you were a thing before last night.”</p><p>Avoiding Wanda’s gaze because suddenly, pancakes seemed like the most fascinating food to ever exist, Agatha pressed her lips together. "Um, actually—" She cleared her throat, "We kissed that night she came over. And then before the lecture. And after, of course.” A nervous laugh escaped her as flashbacks flooded her mind.</p><p>Wanda gasped. “What?! Fuck, Agatha, you kissed her on campus? If Lilia or Jen finds out, you’re in deep shit.”</p><p>Agatha frowned as she loaded her plate with a little bit of everything, except anything sweet. Her stomach had a rule: the only acceptable sweet for breakfast was pancakes. Anything else made her instantly nauseous. </p><p>“They won’t. I’ll make sure of it.” Agatha answered as she ate her eggs with toast. </p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I’ll talk to Rio. She knows she can’t tell anyone.” They hadn’t actually talked about the situation between them, but to Agatha, it was so obvious that she simply assumed it was just as clear to Rio as well. </p><p>“You do too, and yet, here you’re telling me. She must have a close friend, and I bet your ass she’s over there telling this person right now.”</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Rio must have fucked a few brain cells out of her head last night because she definitely hadn’t given any thought to Rio’s friends. Plural, because Rio was chatty and utterly charming. Friends who probably were students at Westview University. </p><p>Wanda snapped her fingers to get Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“Was this a one-time thing? Because if it was, I don’t think she’ll be telling many people. For what it’s worth, no one would believe her anyway.” </p><p>Yeah, that didn’t sound much better. </p><p>“Um— I guess? I don’t fucking know, Wanda. I had a great time with her, but you’re terrifying me and ruining my brunch because now I have to text Rio and tell her we need to talk about something I really, really don’t want to.”</p><p>Wanda grimaced as Agatha stood up from the table, grabbed a pancake, and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>Chewing aggressively as she climbed the stairs, Agatha’s bliss from being fucked into oblivion was starting to fade. Fast.</p><p>She picked up her phone, and when she opened her conversation with Rio, there were two unread messages.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">hey, i’m just kidding</p><p align="right">are you cranky because you’re hungry?</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">i didn’t mean to piss you off</p><p align="right">i’ll grab some coffee and food after the gym</p><p align="right">be at your place around 11 </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the time on her phone. 11:11.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and if God granted Agatha a fucking blessing, she would be at the door before Wanda and order Rio to leave.</p><p>Obviously, she needed to pray more. Or just pray, for that matter.</p><p>She started hearing voices as soon as she reached the middle of the staircase.</p><p>“Oh— Hi, Professor Maximoff.” Rio’s surprised and embarrassed voice almost made the whole situation worth it.</p><p>“Hi, Rio. Call me Wanda.” Wanda greeted her, though Agatha could easily pick up on the hesitation in her voice upon seeing the student at her doorstep “Come in. Agatha’s upstairs.”</p><p>As soon as Rio stepped inside and the door clicked shut, Agatha found herself face-to-face with both women. The air was thick with discomfort, tension practically radiating off them. Especially because both of them were doing their best to avoid stepping on or tripping over the mess scattered across the foyer floor.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“Good morning, Rio. I wasn’t expecting you—“ It was after eleven, and it definitely wasn’t morning, but whatever. Agatha felt awfully uneasy.</p><p>“Sorry. I texted you—” Rio was carrying delivery bags and Wanda noticed it too. </p><p>“I thought the lecture thing was done? Or are you two working on something else?” Wanda asked, glancing between them.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her best friend but kept her mouth shut. She was curious to see if Rio would blurt out something to Wanda or come up with an excuse. A subtle test of trust, so to speak.</p><p>“Um— Yes, it’s done, but—“ Rio smiled nervously, “Professor Kale has some ideas for future events and asked me to discuss this with Ag— Professor Harkness.” </p><p>"She asked you to come over on a Sunday for that?" Wanda fired off the question in a heartbeat. The woman had absolutely no chill.</p><p>Agatha felt like she was watching a tennis match, her gaze shifting between the two women, waiting to see who would be the first to falter in that back-and-forth.</p><p>“No, she didn’t,” Rio replied quickly, her wide brown eyes practically pleading for Agatha to step in. “But since Professor Harkness is very busy during the week, and I spend most of my time in the lab, I figured I’d just stop by. Clearly a mistake— I mean, you two are busy—“</p><p>Wanda spoke before Agatha had a chance to. “Actually, I need to head home. I’ll just grab the boys’ Nintendo stuff they left here last time.” Wanda gave an awkward smile, not entirely convinced. But instead of pressing it further, she walked towards the living room.</p><p>Knowing it was a lie since they had planned to enjoy a child-free Sunday, Agatha didn’t call her out on it. She needed to talk to Rio. So Agatha followed Wanda into the living room, with Rio staying at the entrance, watching them while Wanda rummaged through the cabinet looking for the controllers. Finding nothing, Wanda turned on her heels to check if, by some chance, the boys had left them on the couch.</p><p>Suddenly, Wanda snorted, and was on her feet in a second. </p><p>“You know what— Never mind.” Wanda said, turning to Agatha, her cheeks flushed pink. “Must be at home.” </p><p>Agatha frowned and raised her head to see what Wanda had been staring at just moments ago. Her gaze landed on a bra. Rio’s.</p><p>The owner of the bra mirrored the same behavior, her eyes following the same line as Agatha's until they landed on the garment.</p><p>“I’ll take this to your kitchen.” Rio said hurriedly, making her way to the kitchen with such speed that if she were a cartoon, she would have left a trail of smoke behind her.</p><p>“Please tell me you didn’t fuck on your table. We just ate there, Agatha, God—“</p><p>“We didn’t! We will talk later, Wanda,” Agatha said, placing her hands on the redhead’s shoulders and guiding her toward the door.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m saying this, especially to you, but—“ With the door open, Wanda turned to Agatha, genuinely concerned. “Stop thinking with your horny brain and start thinking with your big-shot-professor-with-a-lot-to-lose brain. I’m serious, Agatha, don’t let this ruin your reputation.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I won’t let it happen. Don’t worry, Wanda. This whole thing just got out of hand, it’s nothing serious.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t seem to believe her, but with a firm nod, she left.</p><p>Agatha went back to the kitchen and found Rio scrolling on her phone, leaning against the counter, and dressed in a pair of jeans and a lightweight sweater. </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio looked up from the device.</p><p>“You stopped texting me, and I thought you were mad, not entertaining guests.” Rio spoke first. </p><p>“You can’t just come to my house any time you want! What if my kid was here?”</p><p>“I’ve met him, Agatha,” Rio said as if Agatha was moronic. </p><p>“That’s not the point!”</p><p>“Why the fuck are you freaking out now?” </p><p>Rio pushed off the counter and began walking toward Agatha with slow, deliberate steps, like she was giving Agatha a chance to bolt.</p><p>Agatha stood still.</p><p>“Have you told anyone? About us?”</p><p>That made Rio freeze in place, her feet glued to the floor. The movement, or rather, the complete lack of it, sent a wave of panic crashing over Agatha. She had never experienced a full-blown anxiety attack before, but judging by the heat surging through her body while her extremities turned ice-cold, and the way her heart pounded so violently it felt like it might burst out of her chest…</p><p>She figured this had to be close.</p><p>“Who the fuck did you tell?“ Her voice was bitter, and she was dangerously close to wrapping her hands around Rio’s throat. The worst part is that Rio would probably like it.</p><p>“Um, Alice.”</p><p>Agatha gulped. “You told a student. That goes to the university.” Agatha started pacing around the kitchen. “My workplace. The student that applied for my extension project.” She turned to Rio. “The fucking student I’ll be fucking interviewing this week—”</p><p>“She won’t say anything! Look, Agatha, we’ve been best friends for ages. I trust her.”</p><p>“I don’t care! I don’t trust she will keep her mouth shut. I don’t trust that she won’t try to blackmail me to get the position just because she has this over me. And that is entirely your fault!”</p><p>“Oh my God! Just— Calm down for a second, will ya?” Rio stepped closer, placing her hands on Agatha’s arms, completely unfazed by the furious glare directed at her. “I would never do anything to cause you trouble. Alice won’t be an issue, I promise.”</p><p>Agatha took several deep breaths, staring into those brown eyes, knowing well that she had a habit of escalating problems before they even became real issues, but it was something she couldn’t control. Not without medication or some solid hours of therapy, both of which she knew she’d never do.</p><p>“I need to change,” Agatha said, stepping back. “Feel free to take some food with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Once upstairs, she took her time changing into a pair of shorts and an old, worn-out NYU hoodie. She swapped the sheets on her bed, tossing the dirty ones into the bathroom laundry basket, and followed up with her morning skincare routine, something she hadn’t had time for earlier.</p><p>With her phone in hand, she made her way back downstairs, determined to spend her Sunday watching TV. </p><p>However, she wasn’t expecting to see Rio on her couch. She peeked at the dinner table, which was empty. Had Rio cleaned up for her? </p><p>Confused, Agatha walked closer to the couch, where she noticed small portions of the food Wanda had brought, along with Rio's takeout, on the center table.</p><p>When Agatha positioned herself beside the couch, appearing in Rio’s line of sight, she crossed her arms, waiting for some explanation about what the hell Rio was still doing there.</p><p>“I made coffee for us. I brought it, but it ended up getting cold, so—” She pointed to the cups of coffee on the table.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, locked in an endless battle with herself. She felt utterly lost when it came to Rio Vidal. No matter how much she enjoyed Rio’s company, even outside in non-sexual encounters, Agatha was painfully aware of everything at stake. Her career, her hard-earned reputation at the university, the years of effort that had brought her to where she was now.</p><p>And yet, whenever Rio was near, something always tipped the scales in her favor. Maybe it was the way Rio looked at her, that damn smile with the stupid little gap between her teeth, or the strands of hair that constantly fell into her face. Maybe it was how Rio cleaned up Agatha’s mess in her own home without being asked. Just because she wanted to.</p><p>Agatha sat on the couch and turned on the TV, and a few seconds later, Friends was on. </p><p>They ate and drank in silence, save for the occasional laughter and snorts that filled the quiet during some of the scenes from Friends. It was Agatha’s comfort show, and she always turned to it when she felt anxious, nervous, or simply needed something to occupy her mind.</p><p>Once again, the show lived up to its promise. Three episodes later, Agatha was fully relaxed, her head resting against the back of the couch, slightly turned toward Rio so that her legs were also resting on the cushion.</p><p>Every time Agatha glanced at Rio, the younger woman seemed closer, yet neither of them made a move to close the gap, both respecting each other's space.</p><p>“You know, I heard Lisa Kudrow saying in a podcast that she hated the live studio audience on the set.”</p><p>Agatha turned her face to Rio. “Why?”</p><p>“She said the audience often laughed too long or laughed when things weren’t funny, and they weren’t supposed to laugh. Said it was pretty irritating.”</p><p>Agatha paused for a moment, then turned her attention back to the television. “Yeah, I can see that happening.” </p><p>Agatha fell silent once more. A few seconds later, she felt fingers tracing her hand, which was resting on the cushion, and those same fingers began to slowly travel up her arm. She visibly shivered.</p><p>With no response from Agatha, especially no negative one, Rio, now even closer, didn’t need to stretch much to place her hand on the back of Agatha’s neck, starting to massage the area.</p><p>Guess Agatha didn’t quite think it through when she moaned with the touch.</p><p>In one swift movement, Rio turned on the couch and settled on Agatha’s lap, straddling her. With both hands on Agatha's neck, she continued massaging the back of her neck, letting her fingers tangle in Agatha's hair.</p><p>“I really love your hair. It was the first thing I noticed about you.”</p><p>“Doesn’t look like it since you made a mess of it yesterday.” Agatha chuckled.</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head, looking at Agatha with so much adoration on her face that it was unsettling.</p><p>Wanda’s voice came to her ‘<em>…stop thinking with your horny brain and start thinking with your big-shot-professor-with-a-lot-to-lose brain.</em>’</p><p>She agreed. Totally.</p><p>Except Rio was on top of her. Gorgeous, hot, and incredibly skilled. Agatha was only human, after all. Maybe in another life, she'd be a witch and could resist the temptations of Rio Vidal. Even then she doubted she’d be able to.</p><p>Their lips met as both women leaned in, the kiss starting slow, each testing the boundaries they were willing to cross. The urgency and desperation to get it out of their systems from the night before had somewhat subsided, but the heat pooling in Agatha’s stomach remained just as intense.</p><p>Agatha deepened the kiss, her tongue slipping into Rio’s mouth. Rio moaned into the kiss, the sound low and breathy, and it sent a spark straight through Agatha’s spine. Instinctively, Agatha bucked up into her, hands gripping Rio’s waist.</p><p>“You’re driving me insane,” Agatha murmured, and opened her eyes just in time to catch Rio’s dilated pupils and feel her warm breath ghosting over her cheek. </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to strip Agatha of her hoodie, swiftly following with her bra. “You’re so hot, I still can’t believe I pulled this off.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows as she found multiple marks on Agatha's neck and chest before capturing her nipple in her mouth.</p><p>“You got even hotter after what I did to you.” She said before alternating which nipple she would suck on, and Agatha had no doubt she was going mad.</p><p>“Enough with the hickeys, Rio, I mean it—“ </p><p>Agatha hissed when Rio aggressively bit her just above her breast.</p><p>“One last reminder that you’re mine now,” Rio mumbled at the same moment her palm pressed against Agatha's center. </p><p>Probably a little problematic, but Agatha chose not to dwell on it. </p><p>Maybe it was a generational thing? She was far too wet to care. (Which, admittedly, was becoming a frequent occurrence in Rio’s presence.)</p><p>“Can I give you head here, or you’re still too old for that?” Rio smirked, the thin fabric of the shorts Agatha wore was doing nothing to keep Rio from feeling how wet she was.</p><p>“Fuck— Take off your clothes.”</p><p>Rio obeyed, standing up from the couch and stripping at a speed that would have been impressive if Agatha weren’t too desperate to have her between her legs.</p><p>Settling at the edge of the couch, Agatha shamelessly spread her legs wider, watching as Rio lowered herself between her thighs.</p><p>“Such a good boy on your knees for me.” </p><p>Rio's eyes were dark and Agatha's words just made her more feral as she lifted Agatha's legs onto her shoulders and her tongue began exploring Agatha’s cunt. She licked and sucked her folds with deliberate slowness, tasting every drop. She lingered in the most sensitive areas, alternating between soft licks and gentle sucks.</p><p>“You taste so good, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s lips and chin were glistening with Agatha’s arousal, and she never looked hotter than in that moment.</p><p>Rio slid two fingers between Agatha’s inner lips, gathering as much of her wetness as she could. When Agatha’s eyes met hers, Rio brought her fingers to her own mouth, slipping them inside, her tongue curling around them.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Rio repeated the motion. This time, instead of bringing her fingers to her own lips, she guided them toward Agatha’s mouth. Agatha parted her lips and her tongue met Rio’s fingers as they slid inside to the knuckles. </p><p>Tasting herself in Rio’s fingers, she moaned as she took her time with her tongue curled around them.</p><p>When Rio’s fingers left her mouth, Agatha’s hands found her hair and started pulling it against her, where she needed her the most.</p><p>She moaned loudly when Rio lowered her face further and her tongue entered Agatha’s cunt with a rhythm that left her breathless.</p><p>“Rio—Shit, just keep going—”</p><p>Each time Rio pulled back and her tongue plunged inside again, the tip of her nose brushed against her clit, and Agatha's head fell back as pleasure washed over her.</p><p>“D—Don’t stop, fuck”</p><p>When Rio felt the walls of Agatha’s pussy tightening around her tongue, she shifted her focus and her lips closed around Agatha’s clit. Agatha’s body trembled violently, her back arching off the couch as a powerful orgasm ripped through her.</p><p>Even as Agatha’s hands weakly tried to push Rio’s head away from her, Rio didn’t stop her ministrations. She kept her mouth pressed against Agatha, her tongue lapping up every drop of her release until, when satisfied, she finally pulled back.</p><p>Agatha pulled her onto the couch again, positioning Rio beneath her, and kissed her, moaning at the taste of herself on Rio's tongue. Agatha’s dominant hand trailed down Rio’s body, her fingers slipping between her thighs and without hesitation, pushed three fingers inside. </p><p>“Do you like my fingers inside you?” Agatha asked, her voice commanding, as she thrusted harder.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched and she nodded frantically between moans.</p><p>“Answer me”</p><p>“F—fuck, y—y—yes” Rio’s voice was more of a gasp as Agatha curled her fingers inside her cunt.</p><p>Agatha’s other hand gripped her hips harshly, her fingers digging into the flesh as she held her firmly in place, preventing her from moving. Her fingers thrust into Rio with an unrelenting pace, each movement deliberate and deep, the slick sounds of her hand working Rio’s cunt filling the room.</p><p>“No—not gonna last long,” </p><p>Rio’s body jerked with every thrust, her back arching off the couch as she tried to meet Agatha’s rhythm. Her thighs started trembling, and her hands clawed at the cushions beneath her.</p><p>“Let go for me, Rio.” With Agatha’s grip keeping her pinned, she didn’t give Rio a choice but to take every stroke exactly as Agatha gave it.</p><p>Rio’s body started shaking uncontrollably as an orgasm washed over her, and Agatha fucked her through it, drawing out the orgasm until Rio’s cries filled the room. When Rio’s body began to still, Agatha slowed her movements until she withdrew her fingers and used her tongue to clean them.</p><p>As their breathing gradually evened out, Agatha remained draped over Rio. Rio raised her arms and crossed them over her back in a lazy embrace, and Agatha sank into it.</p><p>Rio’s fingers started tracing absentminded patterns on her back, and Agatha tried not to think about what this meant. </p><p>With her favorite show in the background and the comfort of Rio’s touch, Agatha didn't need to try too hard.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The week following the start of the seminar was anything but calm. Agatha’s lecture was a booming success, widely praised in Westview University’s law and environmental studies departments.</p><p>In some ways, she was pleased with how her participation in the seminar was unfolding. Her name had been mentioned in articles on university websites, and the Environmental Law Institute, albeit briefly, had acknowledged her for bringing a strong legal perspective to a field that typically only piqued the interest of its own specialists.</p><p>Her inbox was flooded with invitations, offers to speak at seminars at other institutions or to contribute to academic papers on environmental law from a criminal perspective. Most of them didn’t really catch her interest; after all, that wasn’t her professional focus. Still, she left all the emails marked as ‘unread,’ intending to review the opportunities more carefully when she had the time.</p><p>She hadn’t spoken to Rio since Sunday, when she had been at her house. No calls, no messages, no emails. No unexpected visits to her office, which Agatha would have found completely unacceptable yet secretly hoped for.</p><p>Almost four days of complete silence. That meant three full days of Agatha feeling a surge of agitation every time a glimpse of brown hair crossed her field of sight on campus, or in those brief seconds between a knock on her office door and the moment someone stepped inside, never Rio.</p><p>Against all her instincts and desires, Agatha knew this was for the best. Her relationship with Rio was entirely inappropriate, if not outright dangerous, for her reputation at the university. Agatha knew she wouldn’t be fired over it, but she’d never willingly take the chances to go from ‘Witch’ to ‘Professor who couldn’t keep it in her pants.’ That was something she could neither accept nor allow to happen. </p><p>The rational side of her brain seemed to get the message, crystal clear.</p><p>The problem was the other side, the side where her neurons seemed to live in her cunt. Ever since Rio fucking Vidal had touched her for the first time, or hell, since their first kiss, those same neurons had been in a constant state of alarm, screaming, ‘<em>Warning, warning!’ </em> And her body’s response was to leave her soaked and aching at the mere memory of their weekend together.</p><p>She didn’t know what kind of spell Rio had cast on her, but it was definitely working.</p><p> </p><p>On Thursday, Agatha met with William for the remaining interviews for her extension project. She had suggested that he take part not only in the interviews but also in the selection process so he could handle it on his own in the future. Agatha no longer had the patience for that type of thing.</p><p>“So, how are your classes this semester?” she asked as they sat in an empty classroom they had booked for the interviews.</p><p>William frowned at the sudden question; Agatha was never one for small talk. </p><p>She was bored out of her mind, sue her.</p><p>“I’m enrolled in four, and they are slowly killing my will to live.”</p><p>“Dramatic much, huh?” Agatha glanced at him with a brief smile.</p><p>“I swear, I barely have time for a social life. I don’t even know what that means anymore,” He started venting, and Agatha immediately regretted initiating that conversation. Fuck small talk. “I haven’t been to a party in ages, and there’s this big one tomorrow, but I have so much studying to do—“</p><p>Thankfully, the first student arrived for his interview. Agatha had never been so relieved to see a man in her life. The three exchanged greetings and got started.</p><p>-</p><p>During the break before the last scheduled interview, Agatha and William were alone again, sipping coffee that could no longer even be called lukewarm. During the previous breaks, Agatha had kept herself busy responding to emails on her phone, or at least pretending to, just to avoid hearing more of William’s earlier complaints.</p><p>That was until he suddenly let out an “Oh” while scrolling on his phone.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, irritated, after a few seconds of staring at him, waiting for some explanation as to why he had broken the silence she so desperately craved.</p><p>“Oh, nothing- That party I mentioned earlier, Rio is going too. She just tweeted about it.”</p><p>Okay, that definitely made Agatha develop a sudden interest in whatever William had to say.</p><p>Unfortunately, that single comment seemed to be all he had to offer about Rio.</p><p>Faking a nonchalant tone, she said, “She doesn’t strike me as a party girl. Too nerdy.”</p><p>William had the audacity to laugh. It wasn’t a genuine laugh. It was an ironic one.</p><p>“No way. She doesn’t go to a lot of them, but I’ve seen her around.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p> “Let’s say she’s not what she appears to be.” </p><p>William kept looking at his phone, completely unaware of the scowl forming on Agatha’s face. At least now she knew the reason for Rio’s disappearance and no longer needed to fool herself into thinking the student would show up anytime soon.</p><p>A knock on the classroom door drew their attention, and Agatha, once again, sighed in relief at the interruption.</p><p>The relief lasted only a moment, considering that when she checked the next candidate’s file, the name Alice Wu-Gulliver was boldly printed and underlined, mocking her.</p><p>A woman, seemingly around Rio’s age, entered the room with far more confidence than any other candidate that day. Dressed in black with metallic details, bordering on inappropriate for an interview, Alice walked toward the empty chair in front of Agatha and William. She ran a hand through her straight hair, tossing a red lock behind her ear.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Professor Harkness,” she extended her hand toward Agatha, who shook it in return. “Hi, William.” Alice smiled warmly at the young man before turning her attention back to Agatha. “I’ve heard great things about you. And this project, of course.”</p><p>Agatha struggled to keep a neutral expression at Alice’s comment. And though it was a perfectly normal thing to say, nothing more than a polite formality, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that Alice was indirectly implying ‘I’ve heard great things about how you moaned my best friend’s name over and over a few days ago.’</p><p>The professor pressed her lips together, forcing a smile that came closer to a grimace.</p><p>“Before we dive into the usual questions, may I ask what drew you to this particular project? All the other candidates are from the Criminal Justice department, but not you.” </p><p>Agatha noticed the surprise on Alice’s face in response to the question, allowing herself a few seconds of satisfaction. She needed to be in control of this situation.</p><p>“I read your project proposal, and it aligns perfectly with what I want for my master’s thesis. I want to explore more the intersection between environmental justice and criminal justice, particularly how the criminal justice system handles environmental crimes in more remote communities in our country.”</p><p>“My research project isn’t going to do your work for you, Gulliver. I won’t allow students to take advantage of the university’s time and resources for their own benefit.”</p><p>Agatha silently dared Alice to give a response worthy of the challenge, especially after the accusation. If she managed to do so, well, she was in. </p><p>“I’m glad, because that’s not what I’m aiming for here. I plan to pursue a PhD, and I know no university will turn me down once they see I’ve built the foundation of my thesis on one of your projects, Professor Harkness. Your name holds the kind of weight I need for my future references.”</p><p>Yeah, she was in.</p><p> </p><p>After roughly twenty minutes, Agatha announced the end of the interview. The women shook hands again, and as the professor organized the candidates' forms into folders, she couldn't help but overhear the conversation between Alice and William.</p><p>“Come on, Will! Bring Eddie with you, if that’s the issue.”</p><p>Who was Eddie?</p><p>“We’ve been on one date! I think it’s too soon to invite him for this kind of party.”</p><p>What kind of party? A party was a party, wasn’t it?</p><p>“Don’t overthink it! It’s the perfect opportunity for you two to relax.”</p><p>“I don’t know, Alice— besides, Rio is going too. Why are you annoying me? You will have her there as a wingwoman.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened her neck, refusing to give in to her strongest instinct, which was to turn toward where Rio’s name had just been mentioned. There were only two forms left, and she planned to take as long as possible if necessary.</p><p>For the first time since Alice arrived, she fucking hesitated.</p><p>Alice let out a forced laugh and lowered her voice an octave, “You know, I’m not counting on her too much.”</p><p>“Right? I was just telling Harkness how Rio is nothing like she lets on. I almost didn’t believe she was the class representative after I saw her wildly hooking up with—“</p><p>“Uh-huh— it really is a surprise,” Alice interrupted William, who looked at her in confusion.</p><p>Agatha's posture was stiff as she completed placing the documents in the folder with an exaggerated, aggressive movement. </p><p>She was fine. Excellent. Of course, out of all the students, she handpicked the one with fame for getting around. She was so fine about this.</p><p>Ready to return to the solitude of her office, Agatha gave a brief nod to both students, silent, and walked quickly down the hallway.</p><p>She barely heard someone trying to call her when a hand rested on her shoulder, making her stop instantly and turn around with a sharp glare.</p><p>“Sorry, I was calling after you, and I didn’t want to yell—“ Alice muttered, out of breath.</p><p>“If you have any questions about the process or the result, talk to William.”</p><p>Agatha jerked her shoulder away from Alice’s reach and turned to continue on her way, only to be confronted by Alice, who was blocking her path in the empty hallway.</p><p>“Look, Will doesn’t really know her.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“You do. I don’t want to overstep here, Rio would kill me if she finds out I’m even talking to you right now, but,” Alice hesitated again, “She’s not like that anymore.”</p><p>“Okay, Gulliver, let me stop you right there.” Agatha’s voice was low and sharp. “It’s not my business. Any of it. And sure as hell, I don’t have time for this nonsense conversation in the hallway. Are we <em>understood?</em>”</p><p>Alice nodded. When she tried to speak again, Agatha turned on her heels, even if it meant walking in the opposite direction of where she was supposed to go.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock, which read 5:23 pm, twenty-three minutes past her official working hours. Fuck it, Nicky was at his father’s house, and there weren’t many distractions at home. Not even Friends could pull her attention away anymore, thanks to Rio, who had showcased her ravishing talent with her tongue while the show was on TV. Now, every time Agatha heard the opening theme, a vivid (and wet) memory flooded her mind.</p><p>She was grading some tests when the door to her office swung open with a loud crack. She jumped from her chair, which slammed into the wall behind her with the force of her movement, and her heart was still debating whether it was its moment to stop beating or race as fast as it could when Rio walked in.</p><p>“Holy shit Rio, have you heard of knocking?” With her hand over her heart, Agatha glared at Rio, who seemed unfazed. </p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I work here, if you haven’t noticed.”</p><p>“At this hour, Agatha? I was waiting for you by your car.” </p><p>Agatha arched her brow. She was not in the mood to explain herself to Rio, especially after she had disappeared for days. Agatha hadn’t reached for her either, but she had her damn reasons.</p><p>“Well, you found me.” She lowered her head, returning to the papers on her desk, knowing full well she wouldn’t get anything done with Rio there. But she wouldn’t make that too obvious.</p><p>“Are you mad at me or something?” Rio asked as she sat in the chair across from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha sighed and rested her arms on the desk, meeting Rio’s gaze once more.</p><p>“Why would I be mad at you?”</p><p>“I hate when you answer me with another question. Just be straight with me, Agatha.”</p><p>“Hey, you want straight answers, ask a straight lady.”</p><p>Rio looked amused and her lips curled in a charming smile. “I’ve missed you” Rio whispered, reaching her arm to touch Agatha’s hand on the desk. </p><p>Agatha tried not to flinch but with no avail.</p><p>“Okay, what the fuck is happening, Agatha?” Rio’s patience seemed to have reached its limit, and Agatha’s was close behind. The professor stood up and walked around the desk, avoiding the temptation that would surely come with touching Rio.</p><p>“You told your little friend of yours about us, and she ambushed me in the hallway today. That’s what happened.” She said, now near the couch, keeping enough distance from Rio.</p><p>Rio turned around in the chair in order to keep looking at Agatha.</p><p>“Alice told me. She won’t do that again. I’m sorry, Agatha, she meant well—“</p><p>“I don’t fucking care if she meant well or not, Rio!” Agatha was close to shouting at this point. She was still fighting to contain her anger, knowing there was even a slim chance that some employee might still be in the building.</p><p>Rio got up from the chair.</p><p>“I promise she will never do that again, ever. Please, believe me.”</p><p>“I barely know you, Rio. I surely didn’t know the kind of reputation you have, for instance.”</p><p>She knew it was a low blow, and it wasn’t fair. Agatha wasn’t exactly a saint during her university days, not in undergrad, and certainly not during her master’s and PhD. Nevertheless, she was angry with Alice. With Rio for telling her. With William for insinuating that Rio was a player.</p><p>Even if she was, Agatha was aware that it meant nothing. She knew it consciously. However, Agatha couldn't help but wonder if she was just another challenge for Rio, just another woman Rio had charmed to get into her pants on that campus.</p><p>“That’s not fair and you know it.”</p><p>“Do I? How you managed to get that reputation in your first few months in the program is beyond me.” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Are you jealous? Is that the problem?”</p><p>“No, I’m not fucking jealous. You do whatever you want, I don’t care.” Agatha legitimately cared, but she wouldn’t take it back now.</p><p>“Agatha, drop the act! Yes, I went to parties, I had my fun, but not since I first laid my eyes on you in that cafeteria.” </p><p>Agatha wanted to believe her, she really did. But what real reasons did she have to trust her? God, what a mess, yet what was she really expecting? “I should’ve listened to Wanda.” </p><p>Agatha didn't realize she'd said it aloud until Rio lifted her head, fury in her eyes, and marched toward her.</p><p>“<em>What</em>? You’ve been saying shit to me for telling Alice, and you told Wanda? So the rules don’t apply to you?” Rio’s voice was accusatory as she stood in front of Agatha.</p><p>“First of all, she saw me that morning, when I had just woken up. I was a mess with fucking hickeys all over me, so she started asking questions—“ Agatha sighed, “she thought I had slept with Dr. Danvers. I had to tell her the truth.”</p><p>“I’m going to ask again: the rules don’t apply to you?”</p><p>“I’ve known Wanda for decades, and she knows the consequences if this goes out to the world. She understands what can happen to my position here. You don’t, clearly.”</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha, Alice is to me what Wanda is to you. I’m not bragging about us to anyone. I’ve been fine with you ignoring me every day. Fine with you not reaching out. You don’t text me. Have you noticed that? I’m always the one chasing after you, and for what? Every time I see you, you’re pissed at me for some reason you’ve made up in your head and then blame me for it."</p><p>Agatha took a step back. In that moment, during her first ‘relationship fight’ in nearly a decade, she couldn’t help but feel too old to be dealing with this. The secrecy, the bitter sting of something dangerously close to jealousy, the constant state of alert every time she thought she caught a glimpse of Rio on campus, the need to trust people she barely knew, like Alice.</p><p>“Fine, Rio. I’m done. I’ve had enough.”</p><p>Rio took a step back as well, visibly shocked and hurt all at once. “You’re done with me? Because my best friend tried to talk to you with nobody around? I can’t believe this—“</p><p>Agatha should’ve thought better about her next words.</p><p>“It was just sex. It shouldn’t be that complicated.”</p><p>Agatha averted her gaze to the floor the moment she noticed Rio’s wide eyes welling with tears. Without another word, Rio turned on her heels and stormed out of the office, the door slamming shut behind her with a reverberating echo.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha tossed and turned in bed for hours. Every time she closed her eyes, all she could see was Rio’s face, raw with hurt.</p><p>She had replayed their fight so many times since getting home that she was certain she’d lose her mind at some point. In her head, ending things before they spiraled out of control was the right choice, the logical one. So why the hell did her stomach twist itself into knots so tight she thought she might actually throw up?</p><p>Her phone started ringing, snapping her out of the frenzy in her mind. </p><p>Instantly on high alert, afraid something might have happened to Nicky, she threw off the covers and fumbled for the device.</p><p>Unknown number.</p><p>“Yes?” She spoke, and was sure it was the wrong number due to the loud noise coming from the other end of the call.</p><p>“Agatha? Harkness? Is this the right number?” A slightly familiar voice came through, but Agatha couldn’t quite place it, mostly because of the overwhelming noise of music and chatter in the background.</p><p>“Yes, who is this?”</p><p>“It’s Alice. I’m sorry for calling you so late, I didn’t know what else to do.” Alice’s voice was laced with desperation, and that same feeling instantly took over Agatha. She shot up from the bed in a second.</p><p>“What’s wrong? What happened?”</p><p>“We came to a party, and— Rio was weird, upset about something. Look, I don’t know what’s going on with you two—“</p><p>Wasn’t the party supposed to be tomorrow? What the fuck? Why was Alice calling her to tell her about that?</p><p>“I’m hanging up now.” Agatha angrily said, but before she could pull the phone away from her face, Alice's voice stopped her in her tracks.</p><p>“I don’t know what she used— she’s on the floor barely moving. I tried calling for help, but she won’t let me. She keeps saying your name. I don’t know what to do!”</p><p>“Are you sure she isn’t just drunk?”</p><p>The music on the other end of the call was muffled, likely because Alice was in a confined space with Rio that moment, and Agatha could hear murmurs and sobs, probably from Rio. Her heart raced.</p><p>“Something is not right, her pupils are dilated and her breathing is odd— Rio, what the fuck are you on?” Alice’s voice was frantic, but Rio’s voice, low and nearly incomprehensible, only murmured sounds that Agatha barely registered as her own name.</p><p>“Send me the address.”</p><p>In the few minutes it took for Alice to send the address, Agatha had already thrown on the first clothes she found in her closet and was grabbing the keys to her car.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha parked in front of the only house on the street with its exterior lights on. The place must have had excellent soundproofing, considering the eerie silence outside was surely not reflected within.</p><p>She had no idea how she was going to get to Rio. How she could possibly justify being at a student’s house, at this hour, during a party. The truth was simple: there was no justification.</p><p>Grabbing her phone from her lap, she dialed Alice, who picked up on the first ring.</p><p>“I’m here.” </p><p>“We’re in the third door on the right, second floor. I can’t carry her out on my own, she can’t even stand.”</p><p>Agatha’s heavy breathing was audible. She ended the call and immediately started rummaging through her car’s compartments, searching for anything that might help conceal her identity once she stepped inside. She settled on a pair of oversized sunglasses that covered half her face and wrapped a scarf she found on the backseat around the contours of her jaw. Thank god for the chilly weather.</p><p>She was fully aware that having most of her face covered might draw even more attention, but at that moment, she would rather be mistaken for an escaped mental patient than for the Witch of Westview University.</p><p>Keeping her head down, she stepped inside the house and immediately scanned the room for the stairs, determined to get in and out as fast as possible. A few people waved at her, pretending to recognize her, and all Agatha could think was how ridiculously they were all easy prey. </p><p>Who the hell greeted a stranger with their face completely hidden? Did these idiots have zero survival instincts?</p><p>She quickened her pace the moment she spotted the first steps of the staircase. She bumped into at least six people on her way up and didn’t bother apologizing to a single one. Even though her face and outfit made her virtually unrecognizable (she had never once set foot on campus dressed this casually), her voice could still give her away.</p><p>She pushed open the door Alice had described and scanned the room for them. Despite the muffled noise from outside, the space was weirdly quiet until a loud bang came from behind a nearly hidden door, almost camouflaged by posters.</p><p>When she opened the door, which she quickly realized was the bathroom, the first thing she saw was Rio lying in a prone position on the floor. Her head was turned toward the door, one hand resting alongside her body while the other was tucked under her head. Three empty water bottles were scattered beside her, with two more still full. Alice sat on the floor, leaning against the wall next to Rio.</p><p>“How is she? What happened?” Agatha asked as she crouched down in front of Rio, taking her own sunglasses off. Now that she was closer, she could see just how dilated Rio’s pupils were, making it almost impossible to spot the brown of her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t know. She was acting all weird and drinking way more than usual. Then, she disappeared for like, half an hour. When I came looking for her, she was barely standing in this room.” </p><p>“We should take her to the hospital,“ Agatha insisted, pressing two fingers against the pulse point on Rio’s neck. She was caught off guard by how fast her heart was racing. And yet, Rio remained almost completely still.</p><p>“She got a little better after drinking some water. I think the effects will wear off soon—“</p><p>“Does she look okay to you?” Agatha snapped, just as Rio’s gaze met hers for the first time. The moment recognition flashed in her dilated eyes, Rio attempted to sit up with all the motor coordination of a newborn giraffe. Her hand slipped forward, nearly sending her forehead straight into the floor if not for Agatha’s quick reflexes, catching her by the shoulders just in time.</p><p>“Easy, easy,” Agatha murmured as she and Alice worked to prop Rio up into a sitting position. </p><p>After a few seconds, they finally managed to get her settled against the bathroom wall.</p><p>Agatha, still kneeling beside her, grabbed one of the unopened water bottles, twisted off the cap, and held it out to Rio. Without demonstrating any intention of grabbing the bottle or managing to move enough to do so, Agatha literally gave Rio water directly into her mouth.</p><p>For someone who had turned into the devil herself just for talking to Alice on campus a few hours ago, Agatha couldn’t help but see the irony in being in that position at that moment.</p><p>“Rio, how are you feeling? You can understand me, right?” Agatha asked as soon as Rio finished drinking the last drop of water from the bottle.</p><p>Rio gave a slow nod, her dilated eyes locked onto Agatha, unfocused yet unwavering.</p><p>“Can you talk to me?”</p><p>“Y-yes.”</p><p>At least she seemed more aware than when Agatha had first arrived, so maybe Alice had a point that the effects of whatever the hell Rio had taken were starting to wear off.</p><p>“Agat-tha, I’m sorry.” Rio mumbled.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what exactly Rio was apologizing for; the situation, the alcohol, the drugs (singular or plural), Alice, the argument. Whatever it was, Agatha knew she wouldn’t get a clear answer that night. </p><p>“Don’t need to apologize. Let’s get you out of here, alright?” </p><p>When Agatha leaned toward Rio, wrapping an arm around her waist to lift her off the ground, Rio misunderstood it as a hug. Her disoriented arms clumsily wrapped around Agatha’s neck, trapping her in an awkward position, half bent over, half trying to keep her balance.</p><p>“I missed how you smell,” Rio murmured, audibly sniffing Agatha’s neck. Agatha, on the other hand, was growing increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, especially with Alice watching the whole thing.</p><p>Alice stood up before Agatha could say anything, which she attempted to do but no sound came out.</p><p>“I’ll be outside.” And she bolted out of the bathroom.</p><p>Well, it could've been worse. </p><p>With one hand on Rio’s back and the other bracing against the floor, she tried to steady herself when she felt lips brush against her neck- just a fleeting touch. Instantly, she tried to pull away.</p><p>“Rio, not the place, definitely not the time. Let’s get you home,” Agatha tried, but Rio clung to her as if her life depended on it, making it nearly impossible for Agatha to retreat.</p><p>“Are y-you still mad? At-t me.” </p><p>Agatha was. Not because of the argument hours ago, nor the reasons that led to it. But because of the sheer recklessness Rio had shown that night. Still, all she said was, “No, I’m just worried. Are you feeling better?”</p><p>“Kinda.” Rio’s voice sounded steadier than before, and judging by the strength with which she still held Agatha in her embrace, she was beginning to regain control of her body.</p><p>The improvement in Rio’s motor skills should have been a relief to Agatha, who, just moments ago, was practically set on calling an ambulance or dragging her to the hospital by force. And Agatha did feel relieved, but only for a very brief moment.</p><p>With whatever substance Rio had taken now coursing through her system, her lack of bodily control was no longer an obstacle to acting on whatever her wasted brain told her to do. And that’s how Agatha found herself trapped in Rio’s surprisingly strong arms, caught in an awkward embrace as Rio was kissing her neck and earlobe, this time with much more determination.</p><p>“Rio, Rio, wait—” Nothing; Rio didn’t stop her ministrations.</p><p>“Rio, baby, not here.” That made her stop.</p><p>Rio pulled her lips away from Agatha’s skin and withdrew her arms, allowing Agatha to put some distance between them, which she did. Now able to look directly at Rio’s face, Agatha noticed that while her pupils were still dilated, the dissociated expression she had worn earlier was gone.</p><p>“Can you stand up for me?” Agatha tried again, and this time Rio nodded.</p><p>-</p><p>She never thought it would be so challenging to carry a wasted person downstairs. For a moment, she considered letting gravity do all the work, especially since Rio’s neck was tilted toward Agatha’s face, murmuring half-words that ranged from sweet to borderline sexually harassing. And Rio wasn’t the least bit concerned about keeping those words just between them.</p><p>After long minutes, Agatha and Alice finally managed to get Rio into the back seat of the car, despite her resistance to getting into an unfamiliar vehicle. It wasn’t unfamiliar at all, considering Rio had been in Agatha’s car before, but neither woman had the energy left to try to convince her.</p><p>“Is it okay if you drop us both at my house? It’s not too far from here.” Alice asked as soon as both of the women got into the car as well.</p><p>Something about that didn’t sit right with Agatha.</p><p>“Are you sure you can handle her by yourself?”</p><p>“I guess. I think she’ll sleep it off once she’s horizontal.”</p><p>Before starting the car, Agatha let her hair down and took off her sunglasses so she could drive. As soon as her locks touched her shoulders, Rio lunged forward, causing her to hit Agatha’s seat and startling the women in the front of the car. </p><p>Rio’s hands reached around the headrest of Agatha’s seat and landed on her neck, threading her locks through her fingers.</p><p>"Give me the directions,” Agatha ordered, determined to ignore Rio’s blatant display of affection in front of Alice <em> again </em>. Mercifully, Alice simply turned her face forward and pretended to not notice any of it.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha stopped the car in front of Alice’s house, Rio still had her hands lazily caressing Agatha’s neck and hair, an action Agatha continued to ignore completely. Rio’s cheek was pressed against the headrest as she stared unfocused out the window, lost in whatever haze clouded her intoxicated mind.</p><p>“Thank you, Harkness, for all of it.” Alice said as she unbuckled her seatbelt.</p><p>“Not a word of this to anyone, Gulliver.” Agatha warned, her tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p>Alice nodded before stepping out of the car. She walked around to the back door and pulled it open.</p><p>“Come on, Rio, let’s go.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. It was obvious she wasn’t asleep, considering her fingers were still moving against Agatha’s skin. Alice tried to pull one of Rio’s arms out of the car, but without success. The only thing she managed was to make Rio tug on Agatha’s hair to try to hold onto her.</p><p>“Rio, I swear to god I’ll kick your ass out of this car. Let’s fucking move.” </p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha glanced in the rearview mirror and saw that Alice was close to making good on her words, her patience stretched to the limit with her best friend. As much as a part of her screamed not to say what had been on her mind since they left the party and that it wasn’t her problem anymore, Agatha murmured, “Just leave her. She can stay at my place tonight.”</p><p>Alice looked surprised but didn’t argue. With a simple wave goodbye, she shut the car door and disappeared into her house.</p><p>-</p><p>In her garage, Agatha opened the car door and moved to help Rio out. Even though she seemed slightly better, it was clear the effects hadn’t completely worn off yet. At least she no longer looked like she’d been hit with a massive dose of anesthesia, so for Agatha, that was something.</p><p>Taking three times longer than it normally would, Agatha finally managed to get Rio to her bedroom. Rio collapsed onto the bed without any ceremony, and Agatha had to take a deep breath for several long seconds as she saw her lying there in those clothes on her freshly washed sheets. </p><p>She wasn’t a clean freak, not even close. But considering Rio had spent the last few hours lying on the floor of a stranger’s bathroom… </p><p>Yeah, not happening.</p><p>“Rio, don’t you want to take a shower?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha stood by the side of the bed, lips pressed together, staring at the woman lying there like a starfish, taking up more than half of the mattress.</p><p>“Rio, I really think you should take a shower.”</p><p>Rio stayed quiet for a while, and just as Agatha started to think she had fallen asleep, the student let out a huff and stretched her arms upward, asking for help to get up. Agatha helped her and led her to the bathroom.</p><p>Okay, maybe she should’ve let her sleep in dirty clothes<em> , </em> because now she found herself facing another problem: the whole shower situation. </p><p>Agatha didn’t even consider drawing her a bath in the bathtub, since she’d probably have to put one of Nicky’s kid floaties on Rio to make sure she wouldn’t sink. That left only the shower, which heavily depended on Rio’s ability to stand upright on her own.</p><p>"Do you think you can do this? I'll be right outside the door. If you need anything, just say the word," Agatha offered, looking at Rio, who was leaning against the bathroom counter.</p><p>"Can’t you help me?" Rio pouted, making the older woman wonder just how genuine Rio was being. Still, Agatha was exhausted, had a headache, and needed to be up in less than four hours.</p><p>“Fine, take off your clothes.” </p><p>She ignored Rio's smirk and turned on the shower.</p><p>Calling it a shower was an exaggeration, given that she essentially shoved a naked Rio under the water and allowed her to clean herself as best she could while Agatha waited outside, keeping her standing.</p><p>Agatha tried really hard not to let her eyes wander over Rio's body. Even when Rio spent half the time running her soapy hands over her own breasts, squeezing and massaging them. </p><p>“Wanna join?”</p><p>Agatha barely registered the question, too focused on thinking about absolutely anything other than Rio, naked and wet, right in front of her.</p><p>“No.” Her voice came out hoarse and weak, but having the strength to decline the invitation should have made Agatha feel fucking victorious. Unfortunately, all she felt was turned on and frustrated.</p><p>After what felt like the longest shower known to man (despite lasting less than ten minutes), Rio dried herself off while Agatha picked out a set of pajamas for her. Once Rio was dressed, Agatha guided her back to the bed, where she immediately collapsed and cocooned herself in the blankets.</p><p>Agatha returned to the bathroom and locked the door behind her. The day had been a whirlwind of events spiraling completely out of her control, and the way her hands gripped the edge of the sink was a clear indication of the stress that had been building up inside her. </p><p>She took a few deep breaths and moved on with her nighttime routine, sticking to just the essentials. After a quick shower, brushing her teeth, and applying her moisturizer, Agatha returned to the bedroom to find Rio sprawled across her bed, breathing deeply.</p><p>Just as Agatha reached for her pillow, having decided to sleep in Nicky’s room so they could both have space and privacy, Rio’s eyes fluttered open.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Rio asked, her voice almost back to normal.</p><p>“Nicky’s room.”</p><p>“Stay, please.” Rio placed a hand over Agatha's, and it took her less than two seconds to nod and slip under the covers beside her.</p><p>With Rio lying in her bed, wearing her clothes, her expression and voice laced with vulnerability… There was little Agatha could say no to.</p><p>The women lay on their sides, facing each other. Though Rio's pupils were still dilated, her complexion felt more like her in that moment, and Agatha exhaled, relieved that the night had ended with many fewer events than it could have.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha placed her hand on Rio's face, her thumb gently stroking the apple of her cheek.</p><p>“It’s fine, Rio. Just get some rest.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t tell who fell asleep first. As soon as her eyes closed, she drifted into a deep sleep.</p><p>Used to sleeping alone, Agatha woke up a few times throughout the night: when Rio shifted in bed, when Rio draped an arm over her waist, and when Rio tucked her face against Agatha’s neck. Each time, Agatha didn’t mind it at all.</p><p> </p><p>Less than four hours later, Agatha’s alarm went on. </p><p>Her eyes burned as she stretched her arm to turn off the alarm on her phone, but something held her firmly against the mattress, preventing her from reaching the device. Momentarily confused, Agatha lifted her neck and glanced over the blanket that covered her from her feet to her shoulders. At first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But when she turned her head to the side, she felt strands of brown hair tickling her cheek and an unfamiliar weight pressing down on her entire body.</p><p>One of her legs was trapped between Rio’s, who was sleeping on her side, and Rio’s arm was draped over Agatha’s chest. Rio’s hand rested on her shoulder, significantly limiting her movement and making it nearly impossible to reach the phone that was still ringing insistently.</p><p>Agatha began to slowly wriggle free from Rio’s grasp, managing, at the very least, to reach and silence her phone. One of her legs remained trapped between Rio’s, who felt more like a furnace than a human under the blankets, still fast asleep and completely unaware of Agatha’s struggle.</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha finally managed to roll Rio over to the other side of the bed, freeing herself to get up and start her morning. She hadn't gotten nearly as much sleep as she should have, and her headache was only the beginning of the many symptoms she predicted to experience throughout the day.</p><p>Dressed in leggings and a hoodie, Agatha finished tying her sneakers and headed out for her morning run. Not that she expected to perform well, considering the night she’d had, but when she felt like she was about to cough up her lungs after just fifteen minutes at a laughably slow pace, she came to a stop a few houses down from her own. Hands on her knees, she gasped for air like an asthmatic kid on Christmas morning.</p><p>“Agatha, dear, good morning!” A voice far too cheerful for a Friday morning reached her ears, making her spin on her heels to see Mrs. Hart watering her plants. Of course, out of all the houses within three blocks, she had to stop right in front of Mrs. Hart’s. How fucking great.</p><p>Agatha stretched her lips into a forced smile and waved at Mrs. Hart, who, unfortunately, was already making her way over.</p><p>“Are you with family over, dear? That’s a nice surprise,” Mrs. Hart spoke as she stopped in front of Agatha.</p><p>“No, Nicky’s at his dad’s.”</p><p>“Oh, I know, I meant that woman who was with you in the early hours. I wasn’t trying to snoop, of course not, but you know how it is… I have insomnia, and our street is so quiet that it caught my attention when I saw your car. I got worried and went to check if everything was alright, and that’s when I saw you walking into the house with her.” Mrs. Hart watched her with barely concealed expectancy, a mix of curiosity and eagerness etched across her face. She was desperate to uncover the gossip and to see which relative had finally decided to visit Agatha after all these years of her living in that house.</p><p>Agatha knew she shouldn’t have gone for a run that morning.</p><p>“Not family, Mrs. Hart. Just a friend.” She decided to let Mrs. Hart interpret that however she pleased, as she was neither in the mood nor in the right headspace to elaborate. “I’ll leave you to your plants. Give Mr. Hart my greetings.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for Mrs. Hart to respond and jogged back to her house. As she opened her door, she suddenly remembered the dead husband. Fuck. </p><p>Oh, well. Maybe Mrs. Hart would be visiting his grave that day again.</p><p>With the coffee machine humming in the background, Agatha headed back to her bedroom to shower and get ready for the day. For a moment, she had forgotten that she’d find Rio still asleep in her bed, so she was startled when she saw the small yet surprisingly space-hogging figure sprawled across the mattress.</p><p>Should she wake her up? Did Rio have to be at the university that day? Agatha couldn’t remember if Rio had ever mentioned having classes on Fridays.</p><p>Deciding to deal with it after she was ready, Agatha continued with her routine. Showered, makeup done, dressed, and hair styled, she then stood beside Rio, who was still sleeping like the dead.</p><p>“Rio, wake up,” Agatha said, shaking Rio’s shoulder gently. Rio only mumbled in response.</p><p>Fuck, she was hard to wake up.</p><p>After calling her name about twenty times, each time shaking her more firmly by the shoulders and arms, the student finally snapped her eyes open, clearly startled and disoriented.</p><p>“Do you need to go to the university today?” Agatha asked, glancing at her wristwatch to make sure she wasn’t running late herself.</p><p>“W-what?” Apparently, Rio was one of those people who needed at least fifteen minutes of silence to be even remotely functional. Unfortunately for her, Agatha was standing right beside the bed, staring down at her impatiently.</p><p>“Are you going to the university? Today?”</p><p>Rio sat up in bed, leaning her head against the headboard and rubbing her eyes, trying to appear less drowsy. Meanwhile, Agatha fought back a smile at the sight of Rio’s hair sticking out in every direction, her face marked by the creases of the blanket, and her eyebrows pointing in opposite directions.</p><p>“Friday?” She thought for a second. “No, I don’t think so.”</p><p>“I have to leave soon, but I’ll be back for lunch. You can stay if you want. Actually, I’d prefer it if you stayed. We need to talk.” Agatha spoke and left the room without giving Rio a chance to respond. Though, realistically, she probably would’ve had to wait another ten minutes to get a complete sentence out of her anyway.</p><p>Downstairs, Agatha filled her travel mug with the freshly brewed coffee and headed out the door.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha returned home after a tiring but otherwise ordinary morning. Her class had gone as expected, and she managed to dodge a meeting with Lilia by claiming she needed to take care of some errands at home, which wasn’t exactly a lie.</p><p>She found Rio sprawled on the couch, watching TV. Rio was still wearing the same clothes Agatha had lent her, though her hair was damp from a recent shower.</p><p>“Feeling at home already?” Agatha announced her presence as she approached the couch. Rio, engrossed in the movie, hadn’t noticed her arrival, not even with the sound of the door opening and closing.</p><p>Rio jumped at the sound of her voice, startled, and quickly sat up, turning her head to face Agatha.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t have much to do. My phone died and I didn’t find a charger.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her phone charger from inside her purse, which was still hanging from her arm, and handed it to Rio. Rio took it but made no move to do anything with it.</p><p>“Feeling better?” Agatha asked, sitting down on the couch beside Rio.</p><p>“My head hurts like hell,” Rio answered, looking hesitantly at the older woman. “Look, Agatha, I’m sorry. Alice shouldn’t have called you—“</p><p>Before Rio could continue with her sad excuses, Agatha cut her off.</p><p>“Do you have any idea how irresponsible you were last night? You’re lucky that Gulliver was there. That she found you. What the fuck, Rio?”</p><p>“I wasn’t thinking at all. I was trying not to feel so shitty, and they offered, and I said yes. I know I shouldn’t have, and I thought I’d just get a good high from it, but—“</p><p>“You scared me to death last night! I was so fucking mad at you.”</p><p>No matter how remorseful Rio seemed, Agatha couldn’t completely shake the tension she still felt, thanks to the image of finding Rio lying motionless on the bathroom floor of that house.</p><p>Rio tossed the charger onto the other side of the couch and reached out to hold Agatha’s hands, who let her.</p><p>“I’m sorry. Alice texted me this morning saying you were great last night, that she wouldn’t be able to deal with me if you weren’t there. Thank you, for everything. I know you didn’t need to let me crash here.”</p><p>“It wasn’t like you gave us an option. You literally held onto my hair to keep Gulliver from pulling you out of the car.” Agatha’s voice was serious, but for the first time in the last twenty-four hours, a small smile tugged at her lips.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks turned a soft pink, and she smiled, embarrassed. </p><p>“I told you I have a thing for your hair.” </p><p>Agatha shook her head, smiling as she looked at Rio. For a few moments, the sound of the movie was the only noise in the room, and Agatha couldn’t say who leaned in first, but in an instant, Rio’s lips met hers.</p><p>She gave in to the kiss in relief. It was a soft kiss, even as Rio deepened it, and the taste of her tongue after nearly a week was more comforting than Agatha cared to admit.</p><p>The need for oxygen eventually forced them to pull apart.</p><p>“Nothing has changed, Rio. I can’t compromise my position at the university—“</p><p>This time, Rio cut her off. “I’ll do whatever you want, Agatha. I won’t bother you on campus. I won’t even visit you in your office unless you tell me otherwise. Just— don’t push me away.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, weighing her choices and calculating how much she might regret either continuing a casual relationship with Rio Vidal or ending things definitively. Both options seemed equally daunting.</p><p>Since she didn’t have the means to make a pros and cons list at that moment, and Rio was looking at her hopefully with those big amber eyes, Agatha knew she had to say something. Anything.</p><p>Well, if neither option seemed good enough, she’d go with the one that promised great fuck in return. With a few conditions, of course.</p><p>“If you ever, ever, pull the kind of shit you did yesterday again, we’re done for good. You won’t tell anyone about us. If I catch Gulliver even looking at me in a funny way during our project meetings, we’re also done.”</p><p>Rio’s smile only widened, as if Agatha weren’t dumping a list of rules for a casual relationship on her. Was it really necessary to spell it out so explicitly? That Agatha wasn’t committing to anything serious, that these were just guidelines to keep things as clear as possible? </p><p>Agatha didn’t think so. The obvious didn’t need to be said.</p><p>Rio jumped from her spot on the couch onto Agatha’s lap, placing her hands on Agatha’s neck before leaning in to kiss her. Between kisses, she murmured against her lips, “Have I ever told you how much it turns me on when you’re this authoritative?” Rio asked, pressing her hips against Agatha and moving her lips back toward her neck.</p><p>With her hands on Rio’s thighs, Agatha could feel herself getting wet at an embarrassingly fast rate. Considering she needed to be back at the university soon, Agatha knew she had to put a stop to this, but before she could say a word, Rio pulled away with a look of shock on her face.</p><p>“Wait— project meetings? Is she in? Does she know? That bitch didn’t say anything.”</p><p>“Yes, she’s in. I’ll be sending an email to the approved project members this weekend, so not a word to her, seriously.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said, closing the distance once again. “At least now I’ll have someone to keep an eye on you when I’m not around.” </p><p>“Oh, please,” Agatha replied, rolling her eyes.</p><p>They kissed again, Agatha’s fingers alternating between gripping Rio’s waist and thighs, until Rio’s hand slid to Agatha’s stomach. But before she could slip it under her pants, Agatha grabbed her wrist.</p><p>“You know, when I say please, you can't take it too literally,” Agatha smiled, “besides, I still have a class to teach today and I need to head back, so— not happening.”</p><p>“Ugh, fine. Can you come over tonight? I’ve been dreaming of yours fingers since that weekend.”</p><p>If it were possible to feel her pupils dilating with desire, Agatha felt it in that moment.</p><p>“To your house? Do you live by yourself?”</p><p>“Uh, no, but Alice won’t be there. Big party tonight— I’ll tell her to sleep at a friend’s.”</p><p>“Right… Last I heard, you were going to this party.”</p><p>“Nah, I’d rather be fucking you instead.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In theory, the rest of her Friday was supposed to be as simple as it could get.</p><p>After returning to the university and Rio heading back to her respective home, Agatha was in her office preparing some materials for her upcoming week’s classes when someone knocked on the slightly ajar door, pushing it open and stepping inside.</p><p>“Kale,” Agatha greeted, lowering her eyes back to her laptop as her fingers resumed typing.</p><p>“May I speak with you for a second?”</p><p>Surprised by Jen’s sudden politeness, Agatha sighed and closed her laptop screen to give her the attention she demanded. Agatha gestured with her hand for Jen to take a seat in the chair across from her.</p><p>“How’s your extension project going? Have you started it already?” Jen asked as she sat down, and Agatha arched a brow.</p><p>“Are you that lonely that you walked across the campus to chit-chat with me?”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, and her usual demeanor took over her face, making her look more like Jen Kale and less like Professor Kale. If that made sense— and to Agatha, it did.</p><p>“It’s Friday— <em> literally </em> everyone’s favorite day. So why are you being such a bitch?” Jen complained, crossing her arms. “I knew I should’ve sent Vidal to talk to you instead,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Was it common knowledge that Agatha had a soft spot for Rio? Or was Rio just Jen's scapegoat, there to deal with Agatha's sarcasm and rage so Jen didn't have to? Agatha really hoped it was the latter.</p><p>“Why are you here, Kale?”</p><p>“Lilia wants to offer a course on campus this semester, and she wants you to teach it. It’s similar to your lecture, but you won’t need to focus on the environmental aspect, just your field of expertise. Dr. Danvers will handle that part.”</p><p>Agatha frowned upon hearing the name, and Jen didn’t miss it.</p><p>“It was an idea brought up during the dinner you decided to skip. So, I guess you missed your chance to get your ass out of it.”</p><p>“I haven’t said yes, Kale. Why is Dr. Danvers teaching it with me? Why not Maximoff?”</p><p>Jen let out an impatient breath, as if she were the one doing a favor by being there, instead of literally asking for one. On Lilia’s behalf, but still.</p><p>“Because we don’t want an entire short course focused solely on law, do we, Agatha? There’s only so far we can go before we bore the students to death.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, annoyed at Jen’s choice of words. Her students had <em> never </em> fallen asleep in her class, thank you very much. If they had, they wouldn’t be alive to tell the tale anyway.</p><p>“Do you and Lilia have any idea how busy I am? My project starts next week. I don’t have fucking time to prepare and teach another course, especially this semester. What’s wrong with your department’s planning skills? Really, Jesus.”</p><p>“Cry me a river, Agatha.” Jen grumbled, “Lilia is meeting with Dr. Danvers right now in her office, and that’s actually why I’m here. Lilia wants you to meet with them after your class today to discuss the course.”</p><p>Agatha remembered the meeting Lilia had requested earlier that morning, which Agatha had declined to go talk to Rio instead. Considering Carol Danvers was already on campus, it really did seem too late for Agatha to wriggle her way out of this fucking course.</p><p>What a cursed day it was when she succumbed to Rio Vidal's spells and agreed to participate in that damn hippie seminar.</p><p>“My class ends at five.”</p><p>Jen stood up from the chair, her pink lips stretching into the fakest smile Agatha had ever had the displeasure of seeing.</p><p>“Good thing you don’t have a husband to go home to.” Jen said, tilting her head in a sudden expression of mock pity toward Agatha. Before Agatha could throw one of the twenty pens in her holder at Kale, she left the office.</p><p>How arrogant did Jen have to be to assume Agatha would have a husband? Not that they ever talked about their personal lives or followed each other on any social media. In fact, Agatha didn’t even use social media. Her Instagram profile was private, with a balance scale emoji as her bio, and the last photo she’d posted was over a year ago. She didn’t even remember the password to her account.</p><p>Since it wasn’t exactly a secret that she had a son, it was presumably expected that some people would assume she was straight. She’d brought Nicky to campus a few times, but never accompanied by a man or a woman, so like anyone else, she was susceptible to assumptions.</p><p>Agatha sighed and grabbed her phone.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness </strong>
</p><p>Not sure I can make it tonight.</p><p>She had barely set her phone down on the table when the screen lit up with an incoming text.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">why? </p><p align="right">i don’t mind going to your place</p><p align="right"> </p><p>

</p><p>Late meeting with Calderu and Danvers.</p><p>I’m not sure how long it will last.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">Danvers?</p><p align="right">That stuck-up asshole?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed at the text and shook her head. Of course Rio would remember her, considering it was the interaction between Carol and Agatha that had sent Rio into a jealous spiral and, well… ended with both of them sweaty and spent in Agatha’s bed.</p><p>

</p><p align="right">yup, that’s her :)</p><p align="right">anyway</p><p align="right">come afterwards</p><p align="right">dinner’s my treat this time</p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness </strong>
</p><p>I’ll let you know.</p><p>Heading to my class now.</p><p>Text you later. </p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">sure thing, my lady</p><p align="right">knock’em dead </p><p align="right">or try not to scare them to death</p><p align="right">xx</p><p>Agatha snorted and gathered her things for class. It was her favorite subject to teach, law and psychology, so at least there was something to look forward to before the meeting with Lilia, someone Agatha could hardly say no to, given how much of her career she owed to her, and Carol, who carried an unwelcome air of arrogance with her.</p><p>-</p><p>It was almost 7 pm when Agatha checked her wristwatch again, tapping her nails impatiently on the wooden table. The conversation between the three women wasn’t even about the course anymore, as that had taken less than an hour to discuss: Agatha and Carol would have a month to meet and develop the course syllabus; the course itself would run for five weeks, and enrollment would open in the next ten days.</p><p>It wasn’t a long or ideal timeframe, but Lilia had made it clear that Agatha could reuse much of the material from her lecture and her existing class resources, only needing to adjust and add a few topics. So, all things considered, Agatha wouldn’t have as much work as she’d initially feared, and it would certainly give her career a nice boost.</p><p>“… Agatha?” She heard Lilia’s voice, but in the midst of her thoughts about how to fit this new planning into her already packed schedule, Agatha had no idea what was being asked of her.</p><p>“Yes?” </p><p>If Lilia was bothered by her employee’s lack of attention, she didn’t show it. Carol simply smiled, her gaze fixed on Agatha.</p><p>“Dr. Danvers will be meeting you on Monday to discuss how you’ll develop your respective parts of the syllabus. Will you be available?” Lilia was standing up, and Agatha followed suit, relieved that the meeting finally seemed to be wrapping up.</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Agatha turned to Carol, who was already heading toward the door of the meeting room. “Come by my office at 9.”</p><p>Carol waited for Lilia to exit the room, and when it was Agatha’s turn, the blonde placed her hand on Agatha’s arm, stopping her right at the threshold. </p><p>Agatha looked up at Carol, whose lips were curled into a faint smile.</p><p>“Are you heading to your office right now? I’ll go with you so I don’t get lost on Monday. This campus is huge.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her arm away as gently as she could, aware that Lilia was watching their interaction.</p><p>She considered lying, but she knew it would come off as painfully obvious; she didn’t have her purse with her, and unless she planned to fly on a broomstick from campus to her house, Agatha needed to go back to her office.</p><p>“Sure. This way.” Agatha gestured toward the hallway, and after brief goodbyes, she and Carol headed to her office.</p><p>As they walked, Agatha pulled her phone from her blazer pocket for the first time since before her class. When she tapped the screen, there were five message notifications from Rio and a missed call from Wanda. As she unlocked her phone, Carol cleared her throat.</p><p>“How long have you been working here? I’ve known Ms. Calderu for a few years, and it’s not common for her to hold a professional in such high regard as she does with you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, slipping her phone back into her pocket without getting a chance to read any of Rio’s messages.</p><p>“I’ve been at this university for about ten years, but I met Lilia during my undergraduate studies. She was my professor back at NYU.” Agatha explained briefly, but the story was much bigger than that. </p><p>However, she wasn’t about to tell Carol about Lilia’s influence on her decision to pursue an academic career, or the recommendation letters Lilia had written to help Agatha get into her master’s and later her Ph.D. program, or how Lilia had been one of the few people present during her pregnancy— a pregnancy that, for a long time, had been unwanted.</p><p>“I’m waiting for my contract to end so I can accept a position here. This university is fantastic, and you have way more funding than we do back at Salem. Our budget stretches about as far as a glass of water and a cookie,” Carol said, which made Agatha laugh.</p><p>Fine, Agatha was starting to warm up to her. </p><p>“That bad, huh? We have great research projects going on here, especially in the STEAM fields.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard. I also heard you’re the only professor at the university with projects funded by both public and private initiatives, and you’re not even in the tech or science fields.” Despite the strictly professional topic, Carol’s voice dropped to a lower pitch, almost… seductive?</p><p>She decided to ignore it, more focused on reaching her office, which was now just at the end of the hallway.</p><p>“Yes, I’m that good.” Agatha replied without a trace of irony or humility, prompting a laugh from the blonde that was a bit louder than what might be considered appropriate.</p><p>“I bet you are.” Yes, that tone was definitely flirty, especially since Carol’s hand once again found its way to Agatha’s arm, which was starting to bother her more than a little with the constant physical contact initiated by the blonde.</p><p>Not to be rude and wanting to ensure the smooth development of the course for Lilia’s sake, Agatha didn’t respond and focused on entering her office.</p><p>Thanks to Carol’s boldness over the past few minutes, Agatha hadn’t noticed two things before opening the door: the light in her office was on, which was unusual because she always turned it off before leaving, and the door was unlocked.</p><p>Therefore, she was surprised when she walked into the office with Carol and the first thing her eyes landed on was Rio, casually sitting on the couch with one arm stretched across the backrest while scrolling calmly through her phone.</p><p>“Ri—Ms. Vidal, may I help you?”</p><p>What she meant was: what the fuck are you doing here at this hour for fuck’s sake? </p><p>Rio stood up from the couch with a smile that quickly turned into displeasure when she turned and came face-to-face with both women.</p><p>Rio couldn’t think of a response fast enough, and for a moment, an awkward silence hung between the three of them, until Carol turned to Agatha as if completely ignoring the student’s presence.</p><p>“Your assistant is working for you on a Friday night? No wonder you call her your pet.”</p><p>Okay, first of all, that nickname belonged to William. Not that this could be clarified at that moment, and nothing stopped Rio’s face from twisting into a scowl directed at Agatha.</p><p>If Agatha clarified that Rio wasn’t her assistant, how on earth would she explain her presence there? She figured it was better to just roll with the misunderstanding.</p><p>“Anyway, Dr. Danvers, you’re familiar with my office now.”</p><p>“I appreciate it, Agatha. I can wait for you so you don’t have to walk alone to the parking lot.” </p><p>There it was again with the fucking touching, Carol’s fingers closing around Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>If this were another universe, just by the look on Rio’s face, she would’ve sent at least three <em> Avada Kedavras </em> the blonde’s way for good measure.</p><p>Agatha pulled away from Carol’s touch, walking over to her desk, where, sure enough, her purse was placed with her belongings scattered across the surface.</p><p>“No, go ahead. I have some issues left to discuss with Ms. Vidal. See you on Monday.”</p><p>Carol seemed like she wasn’t going to take no for an answer, but eventually shrugged, saying, “you work way too much. Let me know if you ever need a night out. I promise you’ll have a good time.” She smiled, giving Agatha a wink. </p><p>Completely ignoring Rio’s existence, Carol left the office.</p><p>In quick steps, Agatha closed and locked the door.</p><p>“Really? You still have my key?” she asked as she turned to Rio, who was shooting daggers in her direction.</p><p>“You never asked for it back.” Rio replied, and as she walked toward Agatha, she complained, “she’s joking, right? Openly flirting with you like that.”</p><p>“Are you jealous or something?” Agatha teased, crossing her arms. </p><p>Due to the heels she wore daily, she always stood a little taller than Rio, which made her glance slightly downward to meet her gaze.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Taken aback, Agatha’s smile faltered for a moment, and when it seemed like Rio wasn’t going to elaborate much further, she decided to steer the conversation in a different direction.</p><p>“Why did you come here? I told you I was having a late meeting.”</p><p>“I guess you were too busy to read my texts— there was a malfunction with the equipment I’m using from the lab, so I had to come fix it or call someone, or else it would’ve messed up my experiment.”</p><p>“Did you fix it?” Agatha asked, turning back to her desk to pack her belongings into her purse, along with her laptop and chargers.</p><p>“Yes, then I came here to wait for you. Alice has my car, so I was thinking you could drive us to my house.”</p><p>“You’re sure? You don’t look too happy with me right now.” Agatha pointed out, zipping up her bag.</p><p>“Let’s go, Agatha.” Rio muttered, opening the office door with unnecessary force. </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow and, after locking the door, they both headed to her car.</p><p>-</p><p>“If you’re going to keep this attitude all night, I’m going home.”</p><p>Agatha spoke as they got out of her car in front of Rio’s building after more than ten minutes of silence between campus and the residence. Rio slammed the car door shut in a way that would’ve earned her a one-star Uber rating.</p><p>“I hated that asshole at the seminar, I don’t see why she’s suddenly here. Doesn’t Westview University have enough professors already?” Rio objected while leading Agatha to her second-floor apartment.</p><p>“We’re teaching a course together this semester.”</p><p>Rio stopped abruptly in the middle of the stairs, nearly causing Agatha to bump into her.</p><p>“<em>What</em>? Why? She doesn’t even work there!”</p><p>“Can we talk about this when I have food in my stomach?” </p><p>Rio agreed, noticeably pissed off, and continued climbing the stairs in silence until they reached her apartment.</p><p>The apartment was simple yet cozy. There was no entry hall, and within a few steps, Agatha was standing by the kitchen counter, which separated the space from the rest of the open area— a living room with dark green sofas, a rug, and a TV mounted on the opposite wall. Several potted plants were scattered along the wall next to the TV and by the window. A hallway perpendicular to the kitchen led to three doors, likely the bedrooms and a bathroom.</p><p>As Agatha took off her shoes and blazer, she heard a honk, and Rio left the apartment without saying a word.</p><p>“For fuck’s sake—“ Agatha complained aloud. With her phone in hand, she walked over to the couch and sat down, utterly exhausted. Who would’ve thought that less than four hours of sleep would come back to bite her in the ass?</p><p>She checked some of her messages and, for a fact, Rio had sent her a text to warn her about the lab issue and that she’d be waiting in her office, along with a photo of herself flipping off the equipment.</p><p>There was a second missed call from Wanda, and slightly concerned by the redhead’s persistence in reaching her, Agatha called back. After three rings, Wanda answered.</p><p>“Where the hell are you?” were the first words out of Wanda’s mouth.</p><p>“I had a meeting— long story. Why?”</p><p>“I went to your house twice, and you weren’t there. Vision took the kids to his parents, and I was craving some wine and pizza.”</p><p>“You know, you can have both at your house.”</p><p>“Eh, not the same. Are you going to your place now?”</p><p>“Uh— no, not really. It will be a while until I get home. Rain check?”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“Agatha, where are you?” </p><p>Before Agatha could answer, the apartment door opened again, revealing Rio walking in holding bags, the distinct smell of Chinese food hitting Agatha’s nose. She salivated instantly.</p><p>“Listen, I have to go. Breakfast at your house tomorrow at 9? I’ll bring Nicky.”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Wanda seemed like she was about to say something more, but Agatha ended the call.</p><p>She remained seated on the couch, her face turned toward Rio, watching as Rio unpacked the boxes of Chinese food along with the chopsticks. She brought them over to Agatha, handing her one, placing another on the entertainment center beneath the TV, and keeping the third in her own hands. She sat down on the couch beside Agatha.</p><p>They ate quietly for a couple of minutes until Rio broke the silence.</p><p>“So— the blonde asshole?”</p><p>“Lilia wants to offer a short course in a month, similar to my lecture, and so I don’t have to dive too deep into environmental engineering or the environmental aspect at all, she invited Dr. Danvers to co-teach it with me.”</p><p>“I see. So, am I expected to find you two in your office from now on?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, finding it both amusing and slightly alarming how suspicious Rio seemed about the whole idea.</p><p>“Probably. Is that a problem?”</p><p>“Of course not, I mean— she only ignored my existence twice in the two times she’s seen me, openly flirts with you right in front of me, and invites you out for a good time— no, I’m totally okay with this.” Rio quipped sarcastically, shoving a piece of tofu into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha laughed at her words, which only seemed to deepen Rio’s irritation.</p><p>“What’s so amusing, Agatha?”</p><p>“Nothing, nothing. It’s cute when you get jealous.” Agatha shrugged, reaching for the chopsticks to grab some vegetables when Rio abruptly took the box from her hands and set it on the floor beside the couch.</p><p>“Are you trying to piss me off?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and let out an exasperated sigh.</p><p>“You asked me to come to your place just so you could act like this? Seriously, Rio? Don’t forget I’ve got a recent invitation promising me a good time that may be better than what I’m getting right now.”</p><p>Perhaps not the wisest thing to say if Agatha had any intention to go back to her food.</p><p>Rio stood up to place the food boxes next to the other one, still unopened, and turned to Agatha angrily. Rio grabbed her by the collar of her shirt, pulling her up until she was standing in front of her. Immediately, Rio slid her hands under Agatha’s shirt, resting them on her back, and closed the distance with a furious kiss.</p><p>Agatha’s hands instinctively found their way to Rio’s waist, pulling her closer as the kiss deepened, and Rio’s fingers traced the curve of Agatha’s spine until they reached her ass, squeezing it.</p><p>“You underestimate how much people desire you, and you definitely underestimate how possessive I can get,” Rio murmured, her voice low. </p><p>When her lips met Agatha’s again, she shoved her tongue inside at the same moment one of her hands tangled in Agatha’s hair, pulling it sharply. Agatha moaned.</p><p>“If you make tonight worth my while, maybe I won’t have to go looking elsewhere,” Agatha said, feeling Rio’s hand tighten even more around the strands of her hair. She wouldn’t be surprised if Rio ended up pulling some of it out, given how hard she was gripping.</p><p>Rio’s brain must have short-circuited because she didn’t say a word, just released Agatha’s hair and her ass to firmly grab her wrist instead, pulling her down the hallway and into her bedroom.</p><p>Agatha didn't have time to take any of the design of the room before Rio forced her to the bed. Without hesitation, Agatha lay back, propping herself up on her elbows, her hungry eyes fixed on Rio as she stripped off her clothes until she stood completely naked.</p><p>For the second time, and even more intensely now, Agatha was salivating.</p><p>“You have no idea how badly I wanna fuck you,” Rio said, still standing, and walked over to the wardrobe on the wall opposite the bed. </p><p>She opened one of the drawers and, after rummaging for a few seconds, her hand grabbed something Agatha couldn’t see— until Rio turned back toward her.</p><p>Rio held a strap-on in one hand and a harness in the other. The strap-on was purple, made of silicone, and bigger than what Agatha was used to, to say the least. Rio quickly put the harness to use, strapping it on herself as if it were something she did daily, given how effortlessly and swiftly she secured it and attached the strap-on.</p><p>“Take off your clothes, Agatha.” Rio commanded as she made her way to the bed, and the sight of her with that cock hanging between her legs shouldn’t have been as fucking hot as it was.</p><p>“Say please, like the good girl you are.” </p><p>“Agatha, I’m serious. Take off your fucking clothes.” </p><p>She got up from the bed and moved around Rio’s body, placing her hands on her shoulders and shoving her forcefully against the mattress, making Rio lie flat on her back with the strength of the push.</p><p>Having caught Rio off guard, Agatha managed to pin Rio to the mattress with her own body, climbing on top of her until she was positioned at her hips, with one leg on either side of Rio’s body.</p><p>“Say please, or I’m leaving.” </p><p>She wasn’t going anywhere, especially not with Rio’s purple cock brushing against Agatha through her clothes, making her want nothing more than Rio inside her. But Rio didn’t need to know that.</p><p>Rio seemed to believe her, because within seconds, her hands were on the button of Agatha’s pants, begging, “Please, Agatha, take off your clothes so I can fuck you with my cock.”</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha ordered, standing up from the bed.</p><p>She took off her clothes with deliberate slowness, as if her pussy weren’t already clenching in anticipation of seeing Rio obeying and waiting for her.</p><p>Naked, Agatha returned to her previous position, straddling Rio, who tried to sit up to reach the expanse of bare skin on Agatha’s chest, but failed as Agatha pressed her fingers against Rio’s sternum, pushing her back down onto the mattress.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her tongue tracing Rio’s earlobe as she whispered in her ear, “Are you going to be a good girl for me, Rio?” </p><p>With Rio silent, too distracted with sucking and licking Agatha’s neck, she asked again, “Answer me, baby, are you going to behave?”</p><p>“Y—yes,” Rio stammered, and Agatha felt triumphant at having turned the once-dominant woman in the living room into a pathetic puddle of arousal.</p><p>Even with Rio claiming she’d be obedient, it wasn’t enough for Agatha, not after Rio had acted like a brat all night. Agatha gathered both of Rio’s wrists and pinned them above her head against the headboard.</p><p>“Don’t move your hands,” she ordered, taking pleasure in the sight of Rio’s face, her brown eyes almost black with desire.</p><p>Agatha reached for the purple cock to position it when her fingers felt a bump. She pressed it, and the cock began to vibrate— both the shaft and the base nestled inside the harness, covering Rio’s cunt.</p><p>Rio started moaning as the vibrations hit her clit, and Agatha lifted her hips to align the cock with her pussy. She lowered herself slowly, feeling her insides stretch bit by bit to accommodate the toy, and the moans escaping her mouth were even louder than Rio’s, who watched the scene attentively.</p><p>“Fuck, your cock is big,” Agatha moaned out, and Rio, impatient and unable to do much with her hands pinned (not literally, but she knew better than to disobey Agatha), thrust her hips upward, slamming the cock deep inside Agatha with force.</p><p>Agatha cried out in pleasure, bracing one hand on Rio’s stomach for balance as she began to ride her, the vibrations from the strap-on sending waves of heat through both of them.</p><p>“Agatha, god, you’re so fucking hot,” Rio said, her hips bucking upward, driving the cock deeper with each thrust, while Agatha’s movements grew more frantic.</p><p>“You feel so good— your cock feels so fucking good inside me,” Agatha panted and rolled with a desperate rhythm, her body taking every inch of the vibrating cock as she rode Rio with a hunger that came close to desperation. </p><p>The bedroom filled with the sounds of their moans and the slick, rhythmic slap of skin against skin as Agatha’s nails raked down Rio’s stomach, leaving faint red marks that almost drew blood.</p><p>“Fuck, I’m gonna cum like this,” Rio gasped as her hands twitched against the headboard so tightly her knuckles turned white. </p><p>“Fuck me, Rio, make me yours—“ </p><p>Despite the vibrations from the strap-on sending shocks through Rio's clit, she kept thrusting upward, matching Agatha's pace with brutal intensity, and Agatha's movement became unsteady until her thighs trembled and Agatha came in a loud cry.</p><p>Agatha's body shuddered over Rio, who had an orgasm a few seconds later. Rio's back arched off the bed, her hips bucking wildly into Agatha, who began to gasp and cry out as the cock pushed deep into her pussy while she was still recovering from her own peak.</p><p>“Fuck— so-sorry,” Rio said as the force of her movements drove the toy even deeper, sending fresh waves of pleasure through Agatha, making her cries grow louder, until Rio came down from her orgasm. </p><p>Rio’s moans quieted, and she helped Agatha off her body. Agatha collapsed onto the bed beside her, completely spent. On her stomach, one arm propped under her head on the pillow, her face turned toward Rio.</p><p>Rio, with her eyes still closed and her body trembling, lay sprawled beside Agatha, who shamelessly admired her body until something caught her attention near the area where Rio still wore the harness. A significant amount of liquid had pooled between the harness and Rio’s cunt, the wetness spilling out from the material and dripping down Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Did you squirt?” Agatha asked suddenly, causing Rio to open her eyes.</p><p>“Yes, and I did the first time you made me cum in your house, too. I’m glad you didn’t notice that day. My pride wouldn’t have survived.” </p><p>Both women laughed, and Agatha was still trying to catch her breath when Rio shifted on the bed, presumably to remove the strap-on. Or so Agatha thought.</p><p>Still lying on her stomach, Agatha felt hands caress her calves, moving upward to her lower back, paying extra attention to her ass. Rio lowered her face toward Agatha’s back, dragging the tip of her tongue in a straight line from the nape of her neck down to her lower back, sending shivers through Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“Your body does things to me, Agatha,” Rio whispered, her tongue tracing a path back up Agatha’s spine until she reached her shoulder, where she bit down. Agatha hissed in pain.</p><p>“Show me,” Agatha replied, turning her head to where Rio was still nibbling at her shoulder, “how much you want me.”</p><p>Rio seemed unable to contain her energy as she got up from the bed and, gripping Agatha by the waist, pulled her off the mattress as well. </p><p>“Bend over for me.” Rio ordered, and she should’ve known better than to boss Agatha around. Agatha didn’t budge.</p><p>“Agatha, bend over for me, sweetheart. Let me show you how much I want to fuck you.” </p><p>Close enough. Agatha bent over the bed when she felt Rio’s hand press against her back, guiding her into position.</p><p>Agatha first heard the buzz of the strap-on’s vibrator being turned on, and then felt it— the tip of the cock vibrating against her inner lips, with Rio perfectly positioned behind her.</p><p>She could feel herself dripping down her thighs, and the pure thrill of being in that position, anticipating Rio to take her like this, was doing wonders for Agatha's self-control.</p><p>Agatha thrust her hips back, seeking friction against her clit, but Rio immediately held her in place, both hands gripping her hips firmly. Before Agatha could try another equally desperate move, Rio pushed her body forward and drove the cock all the way inside her.</p><p>Rio's brutal thrust into her was neither only the first nor the second. She maintained a ruthless pace, and Agatha was forced to grasp the sheets to keep her body from collapsing onto the bed as a result of Rio's strong movements behind her.</p><p>Agatha let out moans and vulgar words in equal measure, all muffled by her face pressed into the mattress. Rio grabbed a fistful of Agatha’s hair, forcing her head up, and from that point on, there were no barriers to hold back the guttural sounds escaping Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“You’re mine— say it, Agatha.”</p><p>Even if Agatha wanted to, she couldn’t control her vocal cords to do anything but respond directly to Rio’s thrusts into her cunt. </p><p>“Say you’re mine,” Rio murmured, and Agatha heard a sharp clap followed by a burning sting on her right cheek.</p><p>“Fuck— Fu-fuck,” were the only coherent words among all the sounds Agatha was making.</p><p>Rio slapped three more times on the same cheek of Agatha’s ass, each one harder than the last, seemingly unleashing all the jealousy and stress she’d been holding onto over the past few days.</p><p>“Fucking say it, Agatha,”</p><p>It was already the third time Agatha felt her cunt clenching, but the release never came, and she needed some stimulation on her clit to finally reach her climax. Stimulation that Rio wasn’t providing, and her patience with Agatha was hanging by a thread as she thrust into her pussy as hard as she could.</p><p>With one hand still gripping Agatha’s hair, Rio yanked her head back and delivered another sharp slap, the sound echoing through the room. </p><p>“You’re not cumming until you fucking say it.”</p><p>“I-I’m yours,” Agatha moaned between cries.</p><p>Rio pulled her hips back for a moment, stopping the relentless thrusting, and pressed the vibrating tip of the cock against Agatha’s clit. Within seconds, a powerful orgasm ripped through Agatha, her breath coming in ragged gasps, and Rio had to hold her steady as her legs gave out.</p><p>Her muscles were pure mush as Rio helped her move to the center of the bed. Agatha lay down, her arms stretched above her head, her chest rising and falling quickly, her breathing far from under control.</p><p>Rio’s breathing wasn’t any different as she removed the harness and tossed it, along with the strap-on, onto the floor beside her. She climbed onto Agatha, straddling her with a leg on either side, and leaned down, bringing their faces just inches apart.</p><p>“I told you I get possessive.” Rio smirked and kissed her.</p><p> </p>

<em> “I told you I get possessive.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha was gasping for air, and she breathed through her mouth, trying to take in as much air as possible into her lungs, when Rio kissed her.</p><p>Unlike everything that had transpired between them since leaving Rio’s living room, this kiss was anything but urgent. Agatha’s tongue moved slowly against Rio’s, their breaths mingling, and Agatha found it intoxicating how much she didn’t want to stop the kiss, even if her lungs were screaming at that point.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tangled in her hair, pulling her even closer as they tasted each other, until Agatha broke the kiss and turned her face away when Rio tried to capture her lips again.</p><p>“I need some air,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio furrowed her brows, a fleeting expression of hurt crossing her face before disappearing in an instant. She lifted herself off Agatha, moving to lie beside her in the same position: on her back, face turned upward.</p><p>Agatha’s tired brain took a moment to process what had just happened and the hasty conclusions Rio had drawn from just one sentence that could easily be taken out of context. Not that Agatha was making much effort to hide the fact that her chest was still rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant— fuck, my lungs are about to give up on me.” Agatha mumbled, using what little energy she had left in her muscles to sit up.</p><p>She leaned her back against the headboard, looking down at Rio, who was still lying with her head on the pillow, smiling. Rio turned her body toward Agatha and rested her fingers on her stomach, beginning to trace random patterns across her belly and up toward her chest.</p><p>After a few minutes, the silence was still comfortable and Rio's hands stroked across Agatha's abdomen when a loud growl jolted them both out of their reverie—  they realized the noise came from Agatha's stomach.</p><p>Both laughed, and Rio spoke first.</p><p>“Are you hungry already?”</p><p>“No, I’m <em> still </em> hungry— big difference.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and got up. Agatha's gaze followed her naked figure as she exited the room and returned moments later, holding the three boxes of Chinese food. The two settled back on the bed and continued eating in comfortable silence until all the food in the boxes was gone.</p><p>Agatha had already yawned four times and was opening her mouth for a fifth when Rio returned to the bedroom after throwing the wrappers in the trash.</p><p>“Why don’t you sleep here? It’s late and you’re tired. I don’t think you should drive like this.” </p><p>Agatha thought for a few seconds but shook her head, trying to get up from the bed, though her legs didn’t seem to react to the messages her brain was sending as quickly as they should.</p><p>“I can’t. Nicky’s dad is bringing him home tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“What time?”</p><p>“Usually around 8, but I should go home. I’d rather not have breakfast with you and your roommate tomorrow morning.” Agatha wrinkled her nose and sat on the edge of the bed, looking for her clothes.</p><p>“Cute that you think I’d wake up that early to cook you breakfast— and second, no chance in hell Alice will be up that early after a party. Since she won’t be sleeping at home… You’ve got nothing to worry about.” </p><p>“I don’t know, Rio—“ she said hesitantly, sitting with her legs dangling off the bed, and Rio stepped between them.</p><p>Rio cupped Agatha’s face in her hands, her thumbs brushing lightly over her cheeks. “Why are you being this difficult? I know you’re tired, and you should rest, especially if you’re having a full weekend with your kid.”</p><p>On cue, Agatha yawned again.</p><p>“Fine, but do you have a spare toothbrush?”</p><p>Rio smiled, giving Agatha a quick kiss before pulling away, taking her along to the bathroom. Agatha prayed to at least four different gods that Alice hadn’t left the party early, because she’d walk to the sight of Agatha and Rio, completely naked, walking down the hallway.</p><p>Agatha had clearly lost her fucking mind.</p><p>After both got ready for bed, Agatha borrowed a pair of Rio’s pajamas and lay down on the bed. The domesticity of it all felt unsettling, and if Agatha hadn’t been so exhausted, she might’ve bailed on the idea and gone home.</p><p>However, her eyes were heavy, and it didn’t take ten minutes of lying with her back to Rio, who was running her fingers through the length of Agatha’s hair, for her to fall asleep.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone alarm went off at 6:30 am, and once again, her eyes burned as she opened them for the first time. Agatha groaned, silencing the alarm, and sat up in bed until her senses returned.</p><p>Rio took up more than half the bed, her arms stretched out to either side, one of them wrapped across Agatha’s body in a sideways hug. She was almost completely uncovered, which surprised Agatha, considering it was a chilly morning. Hell, Agatha was cold even under the blankets.</p><p>On the other hand, she had a clear view of Rio’s body lying on her stomach, and Agatha let her eyes wander for what felt like seconds before a discomfort, specifically between her legs, made itself known.</p><p>Was she wet again, or was it just remnants from the night before? Fuck, she needed a shower.</p><p>“Rio, wake up”, her voice was hoarse, and she shook Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Nothing. She shook her again, calling her name. Still nothing.</p><p>Agatha got out of bed and walked around, stopping to stand beside the body of the heaviest sleeper in Westview.</p><p>“Rio, get up, damn it!” </p><p>Rio was finally awakened by the combination of Agatha's raised voice and the not-so-gentle shaking, her eyes popping wide in shock— a sight that could have been comical if Agatha hadn't been so frustrated from trying to wake her.</p><p>“W-w-what?”</p><p>“I want to take a shower, but I don’t know where you keep your towels.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, you scared the shit out of me because of a towel?” Rio complained, getting out of bed and walking past Agatha, still groggy with sleep.</p><p>Agatha stood by the bed, watching as Rio grabbed a towel from inside the vanity. Rio returned with the towel in hand and handed it over, still in a grumpy mood. </p><p>“Do you need clothes too?” Rio asked, struggling to keep her eyes open.</p><p>“No. I’m going to take a quick shower while you make us some coffee. Black.” </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for Rio’s answer and headed toward the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom wearing her clothes from the previous day, her wet hair hanging down her back and her face completely free of makeup. Feeling unusually self-conscious about being seen without her usual makeup or even remotely styled hair, Agatha wished Rio had ignored her and gone back to sleep so she could sneak out of the apartment.</p><p>As soon as she stepped into the hallway, the sound of an appliance reached her ears— the coffee machine.</p><p>Agatha found Rio in the kitchen. She was sitting on the stool, slumped over the counter, using her outstretched arm to prop up her head, her eyes almost closed.</p><p>“You’re not much of a morning person, are you?” Agatha smiled, walking over to where Rio was. With the arm that wasn’t supporting her head, Rio wrapped it around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer.</p><p>“No. And you need to work on your waking-up skills,” Rio murmured, her voice heavy with sleep, and she sat up straight on the stool so she could wrap both arms around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“Not my fault that you sleep like the dead. I stopped being nice after the third try.” </p><p>“You’re never nice.” Despite her words, Rio smiled, her eyes soft as they looked up at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard at the sudden intimacy. Yes, they had fucked nasty just a few hours ago, but morning intimacy was far more complex than sex itself, and apart from the night when Rio got wasted, Agatha hadn’t been in the situation of waking up next to someone in years.</p><p>Let alone spending a morning with them.</p><p>“Is the coffee ready? I need to leave soon.” Agatha asked, breaking the sudden wave of affection between them. It didn’t go unnoticed by Rio, who sighed and shook her head.</p><p>Rio let her go and moved behind the counter to pour coffee into two mugs.</p><p>“What are you planning to do with your son this weekend?” Rio asked, handing one of the mugs to Agatha and sitting on the stool beside her.</p><p>“I’m having brunch with Wanda and her kids today. I’m hoping for a quiet weekend, but with Nicky, you never know.”</p><p>“Does he get along with his dad?” Rio asked, “do you?”</p><p>“Nicky does, yes. I mean, we both do— we just grew a bit distant after Paul realized I really wasn’t into men, even while pregnant with his child,” Agatha let out a self-deprecating laugh, but Rio remained serious. “We both want what’s best for Nicky, so I’d say we’re almost friends nowadays.”</p><p>The truth was, Paul had always been in love with Agatha, ever since they met through mutual friends at New York University’s School of Law. She was in her master’s program while he was finishing his residency in Cybersecurity Risk and Strategy.</p><p>A friendship that lasted for years, even as she stayed in New York to continue her studies and he took a temporary position in Germany. When they reunited, Agatha hugged him, relieved to have her best friend and loyal confidant back by her side; Paul, however, believing the feeling was finally mutual, kissed Agatha right in the middle of LaGuardia Airport over ten years ago.</p><p>Agatha’s sexual orientation was no secret to him, definitely not. Paul had been her wingman at countless parties and academic events, and while he never pried into Agatha’s short-lived relationships with other women, he had always been respectful.</p><p>So, to say that Agatha froze when she felt Paul’s not-so-soft lips on hers in the airport arrival area was an understatement.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha’s arms hung stiffly at her sides, and her peripheral vision seemed to watch the bustling flow of the airport in slow motion. Her best friend’s lips were pressed against hers, and in those first few seconds, Agatha thought it was just a habit he’d picked up during his eight months in Europe. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Europeans weren’t like… affectionate? At least that’s what movies had led her to believe. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Of course, the boundaries of that affection were surpassed when Paul tried to slip his tongue into her mouth. Agatha’s body seemed to react on its own, and she placed her hands on his shoulders to push him back. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What the hell are you doing?!” she asked, her eyes wide as she stared at her best friend, who now looked more like a lost puppy in the rain after watching his mother and siblings get hit by a truck. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Kissing you?” Paul said it like she was dense. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Why would you do that?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Come on, Agatha— we’ve talked practically every day for eight months. It’s no surprise to you that I want you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha took a step back, and instinctively, Paul stepped forward toward her, placing his hands on her waist to keep her from bolting. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Friends talk to each other, Paul! Did the fucking European water mess your brain or something? </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Agatha, I know you love me, and I’ve been in love with you for ages. I got a job in New York to be close to you. We can try this.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> He placed his hand on the back of Agatha’s head to hold her in place and tried to kiss her again. This time, Agatha slapped his arm to make him let go of her hair, pulling away completely. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I love you as a friend, I’ve always been very clear about that,” Agatha murmured, taking a deep breath as she looked at the person who had been the most important in her life for so many years, knowing that from that moment on, she had lost him. “You don’t love me like that, Paul. You think you do, but you don’t.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shaking his head, Paul picked up his backpack from the floor and slung it over his shoulder. He refused to look Agatha in the eye. “Yes, I do. I’ll see you around.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> It took Agatha three months to see him again. Their reunion happened at a party where he showed up with a woman seven years younger, with long black hair, earrings and piercings on the same ear as Agatha, and was applying for a position in the criminology department. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Unaware of the recent events between the two, their mutual friends couldn’t stop making the same jokes about Paul having found Agatha’s long-lost younger sister, and the two had to force smiles and laughter every time the comparison was brought up. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Their friendship never fully returned to what it once was, but it improved considerably over time, especially when Paul married that same woman not long after. </em>
</p><p>
<em> However, the friendship didn’t survive the day Agatha showed up at his door seeking comfort after her breakup with Natasha, and after too many shots of tequila, a heartbroken Agatha, and a very hopeful Paul, Nicky was conceived.  </em>
</p><p>The sound of fingers snapping in front of her brought Agatha back to the present, with Rio looking at her with an amused smile on her face.</p><p>“Everything okay there, sweetheart? Where did you go?” </p><p>Agatha smiled and brought the coffee cup to her lips.</p><p>“Nowhere— I’m just tired.”</p><p>Rio stood up and spun the stool Agatha was sitting on so that her back was to the counter. Standing between her legs, Rio placed her warm hands on Agatha’s neck, under her still-damp hair.</p><p>“Are you hungry? I was kidding about breakfast,” Rio smiled, stroking the back of her neck and giving her a quick peck on the lips, “I don’t mind cooking you something.”</p><p>“A little, but I really have to go soon,” Agatha replied. </p><p>She set the coffee cup down on the counter and, unsure of what to do with her hands, rested them on Rio’s arms.</p><p>“Can I see you on Monday? I’ll bring some lunch for us in your office.” Rio offered, stroking her neck and placing light kisses on her lips, cheeks, and the dimple in her chin.</p><p>“Yeah, but something light. I have a class in the early afternoon, and I don’t want to feel sluggish.”</p><p>“As if— your students would build me an altar if I managed to get you to go easy on them.”</p><p>Agatha laughed loudly, snorting in the middle of it, which promptly made Rio laugh along with her and kiss her. Agatha slid her hands to Rio’s waist, deepening the kiss, savoring the taste of Rio, mint, and coffee. It didn’t sound like a good combination, but strangely, she couldn’t get enough of it.</p><p>Her tongue slid against Rio’s when the apartment door opened. </p><p>Contrary to all of Agatha’s instincts, which screamed at her to let go of Rio and try to pull away, though unsuccessfully since she was stuck on the stool, Rio didn’t move a muscle, only turning her head, annoyed, toward the door.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” were the first words out of Alice’s mouth, her eyes wide as she watched the professor detach her lips from her best friend.</p><p>“Seriously? What the fuck are you doing here?” Rio asked, still not letting Agatha escape her worst nightmare. Okay, maybe not the worst, but it definitely made the top five.</p><p>“I live here too, you know.”</p><p>Rio huffed, and Agatha watched the interaction between the two, mortified. She squeezed Rio’s arm to get her to let go of her neck.</p><p>“Listen, I need to head home. I will— um, get my things.” Agatha practically pushed Rio aside to get off the stool and hurried with long strides to the bedroom.</p><p>What a fucking nightmare. </p><p>In the bedroom, Agatha took deep breaths about ten times, sitting on the bed that smelled strongly of sex and Rio. She was looking for her phone when the voices of the apartment’s residents echoed down the hallway.</p><p>“Oh my god, for a moment I thought I was having a heart attack. I can’t believe she slept here!” Alice whispered and shouted at the same time, earning a ‘shhh’ from Rio.</p><p>“She did, and since I want her to sleep over again at some point, be cool about it.”</p><p>“Be cool? I come home, and the Witch of our university is practically swallowing you whole? Seriously, Rio, I don’t know how you pulled this off, holy shit.”</p><p>Both women laughed. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio, I thought she was hot on campus, but the morning after? Geez, she’s reached a whole new level of hotness— well done, my friend.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, and before the conversation could become even more embarrassing for Agatha, she walked out of the bedroom with her purse and phone in hand. There was no way she was going to say goodbye to Rio in front of Alice, and sensing the hesitation from both, Alice finally caught on.</p><p>“I’ll go to my room,” she said and almost ran down the hallway, entering her bedroom afterwards.</p><p>“I’m so going to kill you,” Agatha said, walking toward Rio, who started laughing and backing away into the living room.</p><p>“Agatha, hey, hey,” she was still laughing, and since the room was small, her back soon hit the apartment wall.</p><p>Agatha stopped in front of her and placed her hands on the windowsill, effectively pinning Rio against the wall.</p><p>“So, you’re planning to bring me back here, huh?” Agatha asked in a whisper, her lips barely touching Rio’s ear. Rio visibly shivered at Agatha’s breath on her skin.</p><p>“Oh— you heard that—“</p><p>“Yes, I did,” Agatha ran the tip of her tongue from Rio’s earlobe down to her pulse point. Rio let out a muffled moan. Agatha smiled and pulled away.</p><p>“See you on Monday.” </p><p>Agatha gave Rio’s cheek a light pat and a quick peck on her lips before turning on her heel and walking out of the apartment.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was Sunday afternoon, and Agatha was lying on the couch, trying to stay awake while watching some Spider-Man cartoon she swore she’d seen at least three times before when Nicky came back from the kitchen with a bowl of microwave popcorn.</p><p>She adjusted herself on the couch so Nicky could lie down in front of her, holding the bowl firmly so they could both eat while lying on their sides facing the TV. Agatha absentmindedly ran her fingers through his brown hair, wrinkling her nose at the strong smell of butter as he ate, his eyes glued to the cartoon.</p><p>“You didn’t tell me how your week with your dad went, Nicky. Did you do anything fun?” Agatha asked, reaching for a piece of popcorn and popping it into her mouth.</p><p>“No really, dad was so busy with work. He promised to take me to the movies next weekend.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t take his eyes off the TV as he munched on the popcorn, and when Agatha realized he wasn’t going to say anything more, she pressed on.</p><p>“Did he at least help you with your homework?”</p><p>She felt Nicky’s body stiffen, and instead of answering, he started coughing— a dry, clearly forced cough.</p><p>“Of course, mom. All good,” he said and coughed a few more times until Agatha sat up on the couch, worried he might have choked on the popcorn, but he, unaware that she was able to his face, kept eating normally.</p><p>“Are you okay?” </p><p>Glancing sideways to check if Agatha was looking at him, Nicky put his hand on his forehead and coughed again.</p><p>“I’m not feeling very good. I think I should skip school tomorrow.”</p><p>“What? Since when?” </p><p>Nicky put on his most pitiful face, but Agatha wasn’t buying it.</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Nicky.”</p><p>“Please don’t be mad! I told dad about a project I needed to do for science class, but he was busy, and then I ended up forgetting…"</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, patting the cushions in search of her phone to call Paul, and Nicky, sensing her agitation and knowing his mother well enough, dropped the popcorn bowl to grab her arms.</p><p>“Mom, it’s not dad’s fault!” Nicky’s small hands still held onto Agatha’s arms as she gave up searching for her phone.</p><p>“When is it due?”</p><p>“Tomorrow?”</p><p>“Are you asking me or telling me, Nicky?”</p><p>Nicky chewed on his lips, and Agatha had her answer. Fuck, she was going to kill Paul.</p><p>Since Agatha and Paul were never a couple— and he had only lived with her briefly after she had given birth— they had long since agreed on how to co-parent Nicky, with him spending alternating weeks at each of their homes. For both of them, education was always the top priority, which was why they had no qualms about paying a fortune for the only private school in Westview.</p><p>Apparently, though, Paul had forgotten several of their agreements, one of them being that both of them were supposed to stay on top of Nicky’s schoolwork. </p><p>“How long have you known about this project?”</p><p>“Uh— like, two weeks.”</p><p>In those moments, Agatha needed to breathe to compose herself so she wouldn’t go full Evanora on Nicky. That said, she scratched her nose and focused on breathing, in and out, while Nicky watched her apprehensively.</p><p>In his eight years of life, Agatha had never laid a hand on him, and it was something she was completely against, but it wasn’t for lack of wanting to in some situations. Like when Nicky broke the TV at the peak of his five-year-old tantrums because Agatha hadn’t given him enough attention on a rainy afternoon, and in a fit of anger, he threw his toy at the screen.</p><p>Or when he emptied a tube of glue into Tommy’s hair because Tommy didn’t want to get off Agatha’s lap, and Nicky, jealous as always, took out his emotions an hour later while Tommy was taking his afternoon nap.</p><p>“What do you need to do for this project?”</p><p>“Mom, I really think skipping school tomorrow is our best option here,” he replied, reaching for the popcorn that had fallen on the floor. Boys could be gross, and Agatha was reminded of that periodically when Nicky pulled shit like that.</p><p>“Don’t eat that, Nicky,” she stopped him from putting the popcorn in his mouth, “you’re doing this project now. I won’t have your teacher complaining about my lack of responsibility because of this, especially since the parent-teacher conference is in a few weeks.”</p><p>He shrugged and scratched his nose the same way Agatha had done moments earlier. The resemblance between the two was uncanny, even to her.</p><p>“I’ll get my backpack. But, mom, like, I know you’re smart smart, you’re even smarter than dad, but— I’m not sure you can help me with this project.”</p><p>He quickly got up from the couch, avoiding Agatha’s reaction, and ran to his room. Agatha followed.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” she said, stepping into Nicky’s room as he rummaged through his backpack for a crumpled piece of paper that had been folded multiple times with no regard for symmetry.</p><p>“Look for yourself.”</p><p>He handed her the paper with the instructions for the project. She scowled just reading the list of materials needed; how the fuck was she supposed to find that? Most of it she had in her office, but cardboard? She was sure she didn’t have any at home. Her expression grew more sour as her eyes scanned the instructions.</p><p>Why did an eight-year-old need to know so much about a weather station? Seriously, Agatha was baffled. Fuck private schools.</p><p>“Grab everything you need from my home office and bring it to the table downstairs.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, still bummed about the idea of spending the rest of his Sunday on homework. He shuffled out of the room, dragging his feet.</p><p>Agatha considered calling Wanda, but would it help? The twins were a year younger than Nicky, so she wouldn’t have any experience with that specific project. Besides, they wouldn’t get anything done with three kids surrounded by markers, stickers, paper, glue, and all the other ridiculous materials needed.</p><p>She huffed and called the only person who could help finish that hellish science project on time.</p><p>One hour later, Rio Vidal was smiling at her front door, holding not one but five cardboards and a bag filled with various materials that Agatha couldn’t quite make out.</p><p>“Did you miss me so much that you made up a last-minute science project for your son? Really, Professor Harkness—” Rio said as she stepped inside.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes with a smile on her lips.</p><p>“Shut up,” the words barely left her mouth when Rio surprised her with a quick peck so fast that Agatha wasn’t even sure it had actually happened.</p><p>Before she could protest, Nicky’s voice came from the dining room, “Mom, is your friend here? I think I’m drilling these cups wrong because something doesn’t look right.”</p><p>“Yes, sweetie, she’s here,” Agatha replied, shooting Rio a look to behave. Rio just laughed and followed her to where the boy was.</p><p>Rio set the materials she had brought on the table and pressed her lips together to hold back a laugh when she saw what Nicky had managed to do so far. He had been assigned to make an anemometer and a barometer, which, in theory, didn’t seem too difficult, but apparently, the Harkness family lacked a significant amount of manual skills.</p><p>Nicky had drilled holes into the plastic cups with complete disregard for symmetry or even common sense, if you asked Rio. Instead of forming the intended cross, the cups were haphazardly arranged at varying heights and unevenly spaced.</p><p>“What’s up, Nicky,” Rio greeted him, catching the child’s attention for the first time.</p><p>“Hey, Rio,” he looked up at her, skeptical, “you sure you can help me? Because my mom said you study how to hoe plots, and I’m not sure that’s gonna be much use here.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and covered her mouth, surprised that Nicky had remembered her saying that to him when he first met Rio. She often forgot how literal kids could be, and she forgot even more how much of a gossip Nicky was.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh, your mom said that?”</p><p>“Yeah, she even told me to hide our shovel when you came over, or else you’d want to mess with our garden. My mom hates messes—”</p><p>“Alright, let’s get to what matters, shall we?” Agatha interrupted her son’s rambling and ignored Rio’s pointed looks in her direction.</p><p>It appears that hippies didn’t share her sense of humor after all.</p><p>Agatha often found herself watching Rio and Nicky, sitting side by side, chatting or sharing jokes as they worked. Unlike what Agatha had feared, Nicky couldn’t trick Rio into doing all the work for him; she was clear and patient in her explanations and only took over when Nicky had ruined so many materials that if he messed up again, Agatha would have to find a stationery store open at seven on a Sunday night in Westview.</p><p>The glances Agatha threw their way didn’t go unnoticed by Rio, who, even in the middle of explanations, would catch Agatha’s eyes. They’d share a smile before both returned to their tasks.</p><p>Agatha was at the other end of the dining table with her laptop, preparing some lectures, when Nicky called her.</p><p>“Mom, I’m starving.”</p><p>“I guess we can order pizza,” Agatha said, abandoning the thought of making something for them when she realized what time it was.</p><p>“Yes!! Please, mom! I want pepperoni.” He said excitedly, almost jumping out of his chair, and Rio held the anemometer carefully, worried it might fall apart from the freshly applied glue and Nicky’s sudden movement.</p><p>Agatha smiled, finding Rio’s constant concern for making everything perfect in the child’s project utterly charming. She got up to fetch her phone, which she had left in her bedroom when she called Rio a few hours earlier.</p><p>She had barely set foot in her room when she heard hurried footsteps ascending the stairs, and a few seconds later, Rio was entering her bedroom and quickly walking toward her. Without hesitation, Rio reached for the back of Agatha’s neck, pulling her in until their lips collided. The hand at Agatha’s nape slid downward, fingers tracing over her spine before gripping her waist— firm, possessive, intent on leaving an imprint.</p><p>Agatha’s coherent thoughts fled her mind the moment she felt Rio’s tongue silently asking for permission to enter her mouth, and her lips parted promptly. Rio’s tongue explored Agatha’s mouth with a hunger that made her knees weak, and Agatha responded with equal intensity, her hands sliding up to grip Rio’s hair.</p><p>When Agatha moaned into the kiss, she snapped out of her horny haze, suddenly fully aware that her eight-year-old son was home and her bedroom door was wide open.</p><p>She tried to pull her face away from Rio’s, initially without success because Rio followed her movements. With her tongue still in Agatha’s mouth, Agatha pulled her lips away at the same moment she sucked on Rio’s tongue, and Rio let out a guttural sound— thankfully quiet— as the kiss finally ended.</p><p>“God, I’ve missed this tongue.” Rio said, respecting Agatha’s distance but still using both hands to hold her hips.</p><p>“You literally saw me yesterday.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I should’ve made better use of my morning with you in my bed.”</p><p>Agatha fought back a smile but lost the battle.</p><p>“Maybe next time, instead of spending fifteen minutes trying to wake you up, I can use that time for something much more enjoyable.”</p><p>Rio smirked, running the tip of her tongue along the inside of her cheek— a habit Agatha had noticed a few days ago and found oddly captivating.</p><p>“Don’t get my hopes up, sweetheart. I’m too weak for you to hear that and not do something about it.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, one thought dominating her mind: What were the chances of Nicky wandering upstairs to his mom’s room looking for her within the next twenty minutes?</p><p>Agatha pondered that if she knelt down right then and unzipped Rio’s pants, she could guarantee that she’d taste Rio cumming in her mouth in far less than twenty minutes.</p><p>Her thoughts didn’t reach a decision fast enough— mercifully, by some miracle of a higher power, because it would’ve been the worst possible choice— when Nicky shouted from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>“Mom? Is Rio upstairs? She’s not in the downstairs bathroom, and I need her help.”</p><p>Both women sighed and, in silence, returned to the dining room.</p><p>Agatha ordered pizzas for the three of them, and in a routine more domestic than she cared to admit, the rest of the night passed without any more secret encounters in her bedroom, just Agatha working on her laptop while Rio and Nicky finished his science project.</p><p>-</p><p>The meeting with Dr. Danvers had been going on for almost two hours, and Agatha was taking notes in lazy handwriting in her planner. Even with her laptop open in front of her, she had a strong preference for handwritten notes, feeling it was the only way her brain could retain specific information more quickly.</p><p>“I won’t repeat the same topics from the Flint case study, and I’d appreciate it if you don’t bring that up either. I don’t want the students to think we got lazy and couldn’t come up with something new,” Agatha said without looking up at Carol, who sat across from her desk.</p><p>“I don’t think they’ll assume that, but of course, you call the shots.”</p><p>“I think we can work separately this week and meet again next Monday. Does that work for you?” Agatha asked as she closed her planner. She checked her watch, and there were less than fifteen minutes left until her lunch break. In other words, less than fifteen minutes to come up with an excuse for why Rio Vidal, her alleged assistant, was showing up at her office with a bag of food for them to share.</p><p>“I’d prefer if we met before that, actually. If you’re not too busy,” Agatha frowned because, yes, she was extremely busy, and Carol noticed her expression. “Or we can discuss it more casually at the department’s semester gathering.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? The department’s gathering won’t be for another month.”</p><p>Dr. Danvers laughed, and Agatha got frustrated that she appeared to be out of the loop on institutional affairs when a woman who didn't even work there seemed to know more.</p><p>“Not your department, Aggie. The School of the Environment.” </p><p>Aggie? Who the fuck was Aggie? Agatha wrinkled her nose at the nickname, already imagining Wanda’s fits of laughter when she found out about it. She decided not to comment on it. </p><p>“I won’t be joining that. Anyway, if we’re done here, I have some business to attend.” </p><p>She dismissed her so effortlessly that Agatha almost missed the scowl that flashed across Carol’s face as she stood, dragging her chair back with an audible scrape, and gathered her things in unusual silence. Agatha considered saying something to smooth over the moment— tension wasn’t exactly ideal on the first day of course planning— but surely, by the time they met again, Carol would have moved past it. Right?</p><p>Besides, Agatha was far more focused on getting the woman out of there before Rio arrived. Which worked, as she was alone in her office when Rio knocked and entered without waiting for a response.</p><p>“Hey there, gorgeous,” Rio said as she walked into the office. She set the bag down on the table in front of the couch and made her way over to Agatha, who was still in the same position as before, so focused on finishing grading her Criminal Law papers that she hadn’t even greeted Rio back.</p><p>Rio walked around Agatha’s desk and leaned in, resting both elbows on the table next to the stack of five papers Agatha was holding and reading intently. Rio brought her face closer, and given the height difference, her nose was almost touching Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Are you sniffing me?” Agatha asked, not taking her eyes off one of the worst papers she had ever graded for her class. The student couldn’t maintain the same line of reasoning for more than two paragraphs, and instead of constructing his defense for the case study, he spent three pages reiterating the same thing in different words about how the crime occurred.</p><p>“Yes, and you smell almost as good as you taste,” Rio whispered, her lips almost brushing against Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“Rio, not here, you know the rules.”</p><p>Rio nipped at her earlobe and pulled away, allowing Agatha to breathe again. Shivering and turned on, she watched Rio walk back to the couch.</p><p>Agatha finished grading the paper, signing at the bottom of the last page with <em> ‘Inconceivable. Do better,’ </em> and joined Rio. She sat on the couch and was handed a plastic bowl of Caesar salad.</p><p>“A few friends are losing their shit over your course. Professor Kale accidentally let it slip that enrollment will open soon, and a lot of people are worried they won’t get a spot. Including me.”</p><p>Agatha was bringing a forkful of lettuce and chicken to her mouth and stopped mid-air, “you? You want to take this course?”</p><p>“Well, yes? Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“I don’t know— I just thought you wouldn’t be interested. Don’t you spend all your time in the lab? I didn’t think it had much correlation with law.”</p><p>Rio smiled and shrugged. “It doesn’t, but it’s an interesting extracurricular for when I apply for my Ph.D. And I can’t miss the chance to see you in all your glory like at the seminar.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and focused on finishing her salad until Rio broke the silence again.</p><p>“But seriously, though, do you think you can get me and Alice enrolled? It’s obvious there won’t be seats for everyone—”</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Come on, Agatha, I’m not asking the world here. Just a little favor.”</p><p>Rio flashed her brown eyes, and Agatha had a terrible feeling that there were very few things she’d say no to when Rio looked at her like that.</p><p>“I can't enroll you directly, but William handles the announcements for when enrollment opens on the university's website. I'll ask him to send me the link in advance so you can access it a few minutes before everyone else. That's the best I can do.”</p><p>Rio’s smile stretched from ear to ear, and she placed her hand on Agatha’s thigh, squeezing it, “I really appreciate it, sweetheart.”</p><p>The pet name was becoming so common for Agatha that she almost didn’t recognize being called by it. These vocal displays of affection weren’t really her style, and they had never been a normal part of her casual relationships, but she surprisingly didn’t feel bothered by Rio calling her that way.</p><p>Agatha just smiled back and kept eating. A few minutes later, Rio, apparently allergic to silence, spoke again.</p><p>“Next Saturday night, there’s going to be our gathering. I heard it will be at Professor Kale’s house. Faculty from the department and top students will be there too.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head but didn’t comment further, not wanting to get into the fact that Dr. Danvers had mentioned the same event just moments earlier.</p><p>Rio continued, “I hope you’ll be there. I’m sure they’ll invite you now that you’re our new star.”</p><p>“I’m hardly that. I belong to the School of Law, it doesn’t make sense that I spend my Saturday making small talk with people I barely know.”</p><p>“They don’t just invite people from the department, but also those with professional ties to it. I’m sure they’ll invite Professor Maximoff, so you’ll have her there, and me, obviously.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, unsure if she’d accept an invitation that hadn’t even arrived yet. Why on earth was she planning to attend an event she didn’t even know if she would be invited to? Rio’s spells were supposed have worn off by now.</p><p>“Would you behave at an event where you couldn’t touch me?”</p><p>Agatha’s question made Rio pause for a few seconds. In silence, Rio busied herself with putting the empty lunch wrappers back into the bag.</p><p>“If I go, hypothetically speaking, I’ll be nothing more than the professor you happened to cross paths with for help at that seminar. That’s it. You understand that, right? I can’t spend the entire time worrying about you jumping my bones the moment I step through the door.”</p><p>Rio huffed and placed her hands on her hips, standing up. She turned to face Agatha.</p><p>“You talk as if I have no self-control and keep harassing you all the time. Do I do that, Agatha? I heard your rules, and even though I don’t agree with some of them, I’ve respected them. It’s not fair for you to talk as if I’m some starving dog salivating over a bone.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced at her words. She remained seated and breathed deeply, collecting her thoughts to avoid putting her foot in her mouth any further.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that. I just want to emphasize that we’ll be at a university event, even if it’s informal, with people who can’t know about us. For that to work, both of us need to do our part.”</p><p>Rio didn’t seem satisfied with Agatha’s elaboration on the matter.</p><p>“If you think I can’t keep my legs closed for a few hours in front of others, what’s stopping me from fucking you right here? At least we’re alone, aren’t we?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. If she had to press her thighs together a little tighter, she chose to ignore it, and thankfully, Rio didn’t seem to notice. </p><p>“I'm sorry for that I said. I really don’t want to get in a fight with you. Again.”</p><p>“Then stop acting like I’m some desperate pervert in this relationship,” Rio shot back, her tone still edged with defensiveness.</p><p>Okay, Agatha had made the first comment mostly as a joke, and somehow, everything went to shit. She unfolded her arms and reached out toward Rio, offering her hand. At first, Rio didn’t take it.</p><p>“Baby, come here,” Agatha coaxed, her voice softer now, hand still extended. This time, Rio took it.</p><p>Agatha gently pulled her back to the couch, where Rio sat down with a huff. Turning to face her, Agatha kept hold of Rio’s hand while her other hand traced soothing strokes along her jawline.</p><p>They stayed quiet for a while; Agatha kept tracing soft, gentle strokes along Rio’s face while the younger woman had her eyes closed. Agatha barely blinked, mesmerized by Rio’s sharp, almost divine features; features that looked like they had been carved by gods. Not just gods, though, because the way her thoughts were drifting— lingering on the idea of touching her— was anything but godly.</p><p>Rio spoke first. </p><p>“Look, I didn’t mean to get so worked up like this. My master’s program is demanding a lot from me, and I ended up taking it out on you. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Anything I can do to help? Not that your field is within my expertise, but I can start asking around for shovels and scouting vacant lots for you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, and surprisingly, she managed to pull a laugh from Rio, who shook her head and pinched Agatha’s thigh in retaliation.</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten what you said to Nicky, and you’re gonna pay for that.”</p><p>“Yeah? How?”</p><p>Instead of answering, Rio threw herself onto Agatha until she was straddling the professor on the couch. There were few chances of anyone being in the hallway, considering it was lunchtime and the professors weren’t known to wander around, but Agatha still tensed up.</p><p>She quickly calculated where she would need to go if someone opened the office door. The couch wouldn’t immediately be in their line of sight unless they entered and turned around. That gave Agatha a small window of time. Maybe. Probably.</p><p>Rio couldn’t care less. She kissed Agatha with only the awareness that her lunch break was coming to an end, wasting no time in deepening the kiss until their tongues tangled slowly together.</p><p>A door slammed shut somewhere in the distance, still within Agatha’s earshot, and the sudden noise startled her enough to pull away. Yet, despite her own rules, she didn’t push Rio off her lap. Judging by the glint in Rio’s eyes, she was more than satisfied not to have been dismissed.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“I’m leaving, I’m leaving.” Rio said, pressing a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips before standing up. Agatha followed suit, heading back to her desk. As she caught sight of the stack of papers still waiting to be graded, she let out an audible sigh.</p><p>“Everything alright?” Rio asked, tidying up the mess they'd made during lunch.</p><p>Agatha sorted the graded papers into folders and murmured, "I still need to finish these, and I have—" she glanced at the clock, "forty-five minutes to do it."</p><p>With everything cleaned up, Rio grabbed her backpack and walked over to Agatha’s desk, offering her a sympathetic smile.</p><p>“Academia is a bitch, huh? We’re welcoming a new master's student from Russia for an exchange program. And, of course, between classes, experiments, and articles, I somehow have to find time to show her around campus and sit in on a few lectures with her.</p><p>“Yikes.” Agatha frowned, making a mental note not to intentionally get on Rio’s nerves in the coming weeks.</p><p>Rio just shrugged. Then, as naturally as if they’d been doing it for years, they both leaned in for a quick, final kiss before Rio walked out of the office.</p><p>It took Agatha a few seconds to register what had just happened. A sinking feeling twisted in her stomach— not quite pleasant, not quite nameable. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the time to dwell on what it meant.</p><p>-</p><p>The week passed uneventfully. On Wednesday, Agatha officially received the invitation to the School of the Environment gathering. Sent directly by Lilia, her chances of skipping the event were quickly dwindling.</p><p>By Friday, she met with Wanda to set up the time and place for hiring a babysitter to watch the kids.</p><p>Saturday started like any other day. Her afternoon, too, was just as predictable.</p><p>However, as she prepared for the event and mentally ran through all the possible scenarios, there were only a few things she hadn't accounted for:</p><p>1- Rio having a jealous outburst.</p><p>2- Wanda finding out that Agatha and Rio were still seeing each other.</p><p>3- Rio eating her out in her car.</p><p>4- Running into Natasha— her ex— and Yelena, her younger sister, who, as it turned out, was the very same exchange student Rio had been shadowing all week.</p><p>She really should have spent more time considering all the possibilities, because every single one of them happened within hours that very same day.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A vegetarian barbecue? <em> You’ve got to be shitting me. </em></p><p>Ten minutes after arriving at the Kale Residence, Agatha was holding a beer, chatting with a group of professors in an outdoor area that was larger than the entire first floor of her own house. The space wasn’t intentionally decorated for the event, but it was surrounded by nature, and the wooden structures gave it a rustic charm that perfectly matched the theme.</p><p>Her excitement peaked upon learning that the barbecue would be prepared by a professional catering team hired by the department. That joy, however, lasted exactly two minutes, right until Jennifer explained that, since most attendees were vegetarians, they had collectively decided that no one else was allowed to eat anything different from the weird-ass hippies.</p><p>Okay, maybe Jennifer hadn’t phrased it exactly like that, but that’s how Agatha understood it.</p><p>“Everything okay over there, Agatha? Want to borrow my car to grab some McDonald’s?" Jen teased, earning a round of laughter from the surrounding professors.</p><p>“I'm fine. This might be my only chance to stab some kale and set it on fire— better make the most of it.”</p><p>The same colleagues laughed again, blissfully unaware of the bad blood between them, assuming it was just friendly banter between two long-time university professors. Before Jen could fire back, the barbecue team called for her, and she excused herself.</p><p>Wanda, who had been quietly sipping her beer beside Agatha, nudged her in the ribs and tilted her head toward something behind her. When Agatha turned, it was as if her eyes were magnetized, landing instantly on exactly who Wanda was pointing at.</p><p>Even in the middle of a group of students, there was Rio, dressed in a monochromatic light blue oversized blazer and matching high-waisted wide-leg slacks. Underneath, she wore a navy blue cropped top with a crisscross halter neckline. Her chestnut hair fell in soft waves, framing her face, and Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to stop staring.</p><p>Rio either hadn’t seen her or was doing a damn good job of pretending she hadn’t. She remained engaged in conversation with the other students while Wanda cleared her throat beside Agatha, who promptly downed the rest of her drink in one go.</p><p>“So, where’s Vision?” Agatha asked, pretending to scan the crowd just so she’d have an excuse to glance at Rio once more. She looked so fucking hot it was almost unfair to mere mortals like Agatha, who had to consciously stop herself from letting her gaze linger.</p><p>“He said he knew someone here, some accounting person from work, God knows what exactly. Probably someone’s spouse,” Wanda answered, finishing her beer. Something caught her attention, making her nudge Agatha again.</p><p>“Will you stop that?” Agatha grumbled, swatting Wanda’s fingers away from her abdomen.</p><p>“Isn’t that the woman from the seminar? The one who’s going to teach the course with you?” </p><p>Right on cue, Agatha spotted Carol stepping through the gates into the outdoor area. She waved and smiled at a few familiar faces, surprising Agatha with how many people she already knew at Westview University after just a few days on campus. It had taken Agatha years to get to know everyone in her own department.</p><p>“One and only,” Agatha muttered. Before she could turn her back on Carol, the woman locked eyes with her and smiled, striding toward them.</p><p> “Fuck—“</p><p>Wanda looked at her confused, but didn’t have time to ask questions. Dr. Danvers was already in front of them.</p><p>“Well, well, who decided to give more thought to my invitation. And you even brought—” Carol paused, giving a thoughtful look toward the redhead, but quickly recovered, “Professor Maximoff, with you.”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile. “You can’t really say no when the Dean makes the invitation, can you?”</p><p>Apparently, that wasn’t the answer Wanda found acceptable, as she frowned at Agatha before turning her attention to Carol and saying, “are you excited for the short course? I must say, I don’t feel too happy with you guys stealing Agatha from the School of Law.”</p><p>Carol gave a loud laugh— Agatha was starting to think that was her only type of laugh, which was even more irritating— and placed her hand on Agatha’s arm, the one holding the empty beer bottle.</p><p>“I’m thrilled! The students seem super excited too,” the blonde squeezed Agatha’s arm. “Not even if I wanted to, could I steal her! It’s almost impossible to schedule a meeting with her… By the way, Aggie, I wanted to talk to you about the approach we decided on Monday. I think I’ve come up with a better way.”</p><p>Wanda snorted at the nickname, quickly trying to cover it up by bringing the bottle to her lips again, only to remember it was empty. Agatha took the opportunity.</p><p>“Yes, surely. I’ll grab some beers and we need to find Wanda’s husband, so I’ll catch up with you later.”</p><p>Agatha yanked her arm out of the blonde’s grasp with a bit more sharpness than necessary, but seriously, what was Carol’s deal with physical touch? She barely waited for the blonde’s response before heading toward one of the fridges in the outdoor kitchen, Wanda right on her heels.</p><p>“You know what’s weird? Bohner told me he saw her weirdly close to the ecology professor,” Wanda whispered as she walked alongside Agatha.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, unsure how much to trust information from Bohner, but she wouldn’t be too surprised if it were true. In fact, she'd be relieved to find out Carol was just someone who flirted with everyone around her, not just Agatha.</p><p>“I guess the wedding can't come soon enough then, bec—“</p><p>“BOO!” </p><p>Rio jumped out from nearly behind the same fridge Agatha was opening, almost literally scaring her to death. Agatha let go of the fridge door so abruptly that, despite the rubber lining, it made a loud thud as it snapped shut. Her hand flew to her chest. </p><p>Wanda didn’t fare much better, she barely managed to keep from dropping the empty bottles in her hands.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” Agatha hissed, quickly glancing around to see if anyone had noticed the ridiculous scene. Luckily, everyone seemed too wrapped up in their conversations. Meanwhile, Rio was laughing, clearly enjoying herself. Wanda just pressed her lips together. </p><p>“Who’s getting married?” Rio asked, paying little attention to Agatha and Wanda’s displeased expressions.</p><p>“No one,” Agatha replied, nodding when Wanda signaled that she was going to toss the empty bottles in the trash.</p><p>With Wanda gone, she turned her full attention to Rio, who was still grinning. "Are you enjoying yourself after nearly giving me a heart attack? You know I hate jump scares."</p><p>“Sorry, couldn’t resist. I’ll behave from now on, <em> sweetheart </em>, don’t you worry.” Rio whispered the pet name, “However, I can’t keep such promise if certain people don’t leave you the fuck alone.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to turn around to know who Rio was glaring at— it was obvious she had witnessed the entire interaction. With an eye roll, Agatha opened the fridge again, grabbed three beers, and handed one to Rio, who accepted it without hesitation.</p><p>“This jealousy of yours is not very healthy,” Agatha remarked.</p><p>Rio merely shrugged in response, offering no further comment, especially since Wanda was already making her way back toward them.</p><p>-</p><p>As expected, the conversation between the three didn’t flow naturally, always ending in an awkward silence. What had once been just hints was now undeniable— Agatha was sure that Wanda didn’t like Rio Vidal one bit. Which meant her hesitation about telling Wanda that she was still involved with Rio had solidified into a decision: she wouldn’t tell her.</p><p>Agatha was finishing a vegan kebab (which was surprisingly good despite her initial skepticism) when Wanda, who had stepped away to take a phone call, returned with quick strides and furrowed brows.</p><p>“The nanny just called, and Billy is throwing up nonstop. Vis said he’d head home on his own, but I’m worried it might be something serious, so I’m going with him. He’s already in the car.”</p><p>“How are Nicky and Tommy? I’m going with you.” Agatha said, following Wanda towards the exit gate.</p><p>“They are fine— you should stay, really. Vis and I can handle Billy just fine, and it’ll be the kids' bedtime soon anyway. I’ll drop Nicky off at your house later, just text me.”</p><p>“Are you sure? If Nicky complains about anything, call me right away, and I’ll get an Uber to your place.”</p><p>They were now outside the Kale residence, standing on the sidewalk lined with parked cars. In one of them, Vision was waiting with the headlights on.</p><p>“It’s fine, enjoy your night out,” Wanda smiled, but she didn’t head to the car. Instead, she wrapped her fingers around Agatha’s elbow just as she was turning back toward the house. “Agatha, I’m saying this as a friend: stay away from Vidal. She hasn’t taken her eyes off you since we got here, and I seriously think she’s bad news.”</p><p>Agatha made a conscious effort to keep her expression neutral and forced a smile at her friend. What could she possibly say? This wasn’t the first time Wanda had warned her about Rio, and even though Agatha partially agreed with her friend’s concerns, she had long since given up fighting the obvious: a blatant and undeniable attraction she felt for Rio Vidal.</p><p>Agatha used her hand to brush her hair back over her shoulder, hoping Wanda would be fooled by the act, “Please, Wanda, I can handle a few lingering looks from a student.”</p><p>With a not-so-convinced smile, Wanda got into her car, and Agatha waited until the car had left the street. She walked over to the house’s outer wall and leaned against it.</p><p>She exhaled slowly. The guilt of lying— well, omitting the truth— from Wanda was starting to twist her stomach. Or maybe it was just that damn vegan kebab, because yes, Agatha was still pretty pissed about the event’s food choices. But honestly, should she have expected anything different? She should have taken Jen fucking Kale's offer and gone to McDonald’s—</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted when she noticed a familiar shadow approaching. With the early evening dimming the surroundings, it took her a few seconds to make out the figure, but soon, Dr. Danvers’ features were illuminated as the street lights flickered on in unison.</p><p>She was carrying two beer bottles and handed one to Agatha, who accepted it in silence.</p><p>“You’re not leaving already, are you?” Carol asked, bringing the bottle to her red-stained lips.</p><p>“Not yet. I was actually heading inside.”</p><p>“If you don’t want to talk about work right now, I get it. But you don’t have to run away from me every time you see me coming your way.” The blonde chuckled, briefly lifting a hand as if to touch Agatha’s arm again, but this time, good sense prevailed, and she pulled back.</p><p>Agatha took two sips of her drink, which must have been her fifth or sixth that night. She really needed to slow down, but at least it gave her the boost she needed to talk to Carol without overthinking and worrying about making things awkward. The blonde had been handling that part just fine on her own since they met.</p><p>“Look, we can talk about work. I’m okay with that. But you should know that I don’t get involved with people I work with, if that’s what you’ve been hinting at.”</p><p>Surprise flickered across Carol’s face, but she recovered quickly. The smile on her lips remained intact.</p><p>“We don’t exactly work at the same place.” </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but Carol beat her to it. “But this time, I swear to God, I’m only here to talk about the course.” She raised both hands in mock surrender, despite holding a beer bottle in one of them.</p><p>Agatha smiled and took another sip from her bottle. Fine, she had lied when she said they could talk about work. At that moment, discussing the course was the last thing she wanted to do, especially with Dr. Danvers. Her thoughts quickly drifted to someone else, someone she would much rather be talking to, about anything.</p><p>Maybe her students were onto something when they called her a witch because, as if by magic, that very person stepped through the house’s front gate.</p><p>The only difference? In her imagination, Rio wasn’t livid. </p><p>Rio glanced to the opposite side of the street before turning toward them. </p><p>Carol noticed Rio’s arrival too and let out an irritated huff. “I suppose it’d be better if we simply scheduled a meeting. It’s almost impossible to get you alone tonight.”</p><p>Terrible choice of words. Absolutely terrible. Agatha could have sworn Rio stood frozen for minutes, inhaling sharply. It had probably only been seconds, and then, just as Agatha expected, Rio started walking toward them.</p><p>“Danvers, right? There are people looking for you inside.” Rio said in a deeper voice than usual— the tone she used when she was mad.</p><p>It wasn’t the worst lie she could have come up with on the spot, but it definitely wasn’t the best. Rio didn’t seem to care, and Carol bought the lie easily.</p><p>“I’ll text you to set up a meeting, Aggie,” Carol smiled and quickly placed her hand on Agatha’s shoulder in farewell before heading back inside the house.</p><p>The street’s silence didn’t last long.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me. I thought you left with Maximoff, without even saying goodbye— I come looking for you and you’re here? With her? Alone? What for?”</p><p>Rio stood with her arms crossed in front of Agatha, both of them standing close to the entrance of the house. Rio didn’t seem to care about keeping her voice down.</p><p>What was worse than being caught in a relationship that could very well serve as the perfect example of a midlife crisis? Being caught discussing that very relationship.</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio’s arm and started walking toward the alley two houses down from the Kale residence. Rio grumbled the entire way.</p><p>“I wasn’t alone with her on purpose,” Agatha said, frustration creeping into her voice, once they reached the alley. “I was leaving with Wanda, and she insisted that I stay. Then Carol found me— okay, I shouldn’t even be explaining myself to you, Rio. What the fuck is with this jealousy? It was cute at first, but now it’s getting pretty annoying.”</p><p>Rio still had her arms crossed, her lips pressed.</p><p>“What do you expect? Like, honestly? This is the second time I've seen you two all over each other today. It's not enough that, coincidentally, she's always touching you, but it seems like you're deliberately putting yourself in shady situations, and it’s always her. I haven't forgotten when you took her to your office that night."</p><p>“She’s just a colleague, how many times do I have to repeat myself?” Agatha rubbed her nose, taking a deep breath. “We weren’t all over each other, you’re saying that because you can’t stand the fact that we have to work together.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and started pacing in the cramped alley.</p><p>"No, I can't. Because she has a free pass to be around you anytime, anywhere, while I practically have to dig a hole through your office wall just to get in without anyone questioning why I'm there."</p><p>Agatha didn’t want another fight with Rio. At this rate, they were setting a record for how many arguments they could have in such a short time in a relationship that wasn’t even serious. She was trying to think about what to say when something very specific Rio said caught her attention.</p><p>“Wait— who questioned you?”</p><p>“Will did,” Rio replied, and the mere suspicion that Agatha might be steering the conversation in another direction made her stop pacing. She stood in front of Agatha, arms still crossed, eyes narrowed. “It doesn’t matter, he doesn’t know anything— What matters is that asshole keeps showing up everywhere, and why is she always fucking touching you?”</p><p>It did matter, especially because if William was even ten percent as mouthy with others as he was with her, this could become a problem. Agatha knew stories about people she had never even met just from the few hours they spent together weekly, because the boy simply didn’t know how to keep his mouth shut and mind his own business.</p><p>Nonetheless, Agatha had already decided days ago that she would try her best not to get on Rio’s nerves— particularly with her overwhelmed by university matters and the responsibilities that had been piling up on her lately.</p><p>Taking advantage of the fact that Rio had finally stopped pacing in front of her, Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>"I'm being as honest as I possibly can with you, Rio. You don’t need to get so worked up, especially since I'll be stuck with her for months.”</p><p>Rio made a face.</p><p>"Professionally," Agatha added. "It’s going to be a long few months for you if you can’t get past this.”</p><p>Agatha hoped that Rio hadn’t caught on to the insinuation that they might still be involved in the coming months, but considering how Rio’s defensiveness had eased up, she had definitely noticed.</p><p>It didn't last very long.</p><p>“Has she ever made a move on you, besides that night? I can tell if you're lying to me, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha must have grimaced, because Rio started getting worked up again.</p><p>“Fuck, I knew it—“</p><p>“Okay, she hinted at something like that today, but I made it clear I wasn’t interested. And I’m not.”</p><p>“I fucking hate that bitch.” Rio murmured under her breath. Whether Agatha was meant to hear it or not, she didn’t know, but Agatha smiled and took a step closer to Rio, her hands squeezing her shoulders.</p><p>“If it makes you feel better, I heard she’s... forward with other people. She doesn’t specifically want me, just anyone. So there’s no reason for you to freak out. Frankly, I don’t want to have this conversation every time I interact with her.”</p><p>Rio exhaled and uncrossed her arms, appearing more relaxed. Agatha, however, began to feel anxious about their prolonged absence, but she wasn’t about to risk bringing it up to Rio and triggering another outburst.</p><p>Close for the first time that night, Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s waist, trying to ground herself through the touch. They were silent for a moment until Rio spoke again, her voice back to normal.</p><p>“I wanna go home with you tonight.”</p><p>Agatha stifled a laugh, not all that surprised by Rio’s request. Of course, the jealousy had to lead to this outcome.</p><p>“You can’t, Nicky’s with me this weekend.”</p><p>“Shouldn't he be with his dad?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes, but his dad, as usual, couldn’t keep his word.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond when her phone began to ring. She pulled it out of her pocket, glanced at the screen, sighed, and silenced the device.</p><p>“Yelena is here, I need to go back to the house.”</p><p>The name caught Agatha's attention. Not because it was uncommon or unfamiliar, but because she met only one person with that name. A chill ran down her spine.</p><p>“Yelena?”</p><p>“Yeah, the exchange student I told you about. She was supposed to arrive earlier, but I think the jet lag kicked her ass. Anyway, I need to go meet her and introduce her to the folks in our department.” Rio replied, fiddling with her phone, not paying attention to Agatha, who looked as though she had just seen a ghost.</p><p>Rio started walking back towards Jen’s street, and despite her heart pounding in her chest, Agatha focused on calming her breath. Of course, there were more than one woman named Yelena in Russia, and what were the chances that her ex’s sister would be studying at the same university where she worked? Slim. </p><p>Yeah, Agatha had nothing to worry about.</p><p>They walked in silence until they reached Kale's house, just in time to see a car pull over on the street. A woman, appearing to be about the same age as Rio, got out of the car. Her short blonde hair, cut at ear length, didn’t resemble anyone Agatha knew, and she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>However, the voice that came from the other side of the car was far <em>too</em> familiar.</p><p>“— Wait for me, damn. My purse got stuck in the seatbelt.”</p><p>Natasha.</p><p>Agatha stopped in her tracks instantly. </p><p>Rio didn't notice, continuing to walk toward the blonde, who was indeed the same Yelena Agatha had suspected.</p><p>“You’re finally here! I gotta say, some of our classmates are already hammered,” Rio said, oblivious to the curious and shocked looks on Agatha's, Yelena's, and Natasha's faces as the three came into view of each other on the sidewalk.</p><p>“Oh my god! Agatha?” Yelena was the first to speak, in a strong Russian accent, approaching Agatha and surprising her with a hug. Agatha didn’t have time to react, placing a hand on Yelena’s back, her eyes fixed on Natasha, who wore the same shocked expression.</p><p>Rio was so confused and baffled by what was happening that, for the first time since Agatha had met her, she was left speechless. So was Natasha.</p><p>“What are you doing here?— You work at Westview University? What a coincidence! Wow, it’s been so long since I last saw you! How old was I? Fifteen? Or younger? Damn, I can't believe it’s really you!”</p><p>It seemed like Yelena was still the same chatterbox, hardly giving anyone a chance to speak. Agatha stepped back from Yelena, forcing herself to look away from Natasha and focus on the blonde instead.</p><p>Rio spoke first. “Wait, you know each other?”</p><p>Of course Yelena was already talking. "Agatha was my sister's girlfriend! I mean, fiancée. They dated for ages a few years ago."</p><p>Rio's eyes shifted between Agatha and Natasha, the pieces slowly falling into place. She could see the tension between them, both of them silent and still trying to process the shock of seeing each other after so long.</p><p>Natasha seemed to recover from the surprise faster than Agatha.</p><p>“It’s been a long time, huh? How are you, hon?” Natasha said, stepping closer to Agatha and having the audacity to call her by the same pet name she used when they were a couple.</p><p>The chill down Agatha's spine returned, settling deep within her. She remained rooted to the spot, not sure how to react. When Natasha realized Agatha wasn't going to move toward her, she stopped beside Rio, who deserved an Oscar for maintaining a neutral expression.</p><p>Agatha deliberately ignored Natasha.</p><p>“I guess you were a very annoying teenager when I last saw you,” Agatha forced a smile at Yelena, who laughed. “I’m a professor at Westview University, yes. I had no idea you were in the Environmental field.”</p><p>Of course, she couldn’t have known. Agatha had cut all communication with Natasha's family when they broke up, including Yelena.</p><p>To Agatha’s dismay, Natasha was talking again as if she were reconnecting with an old friend.</p><p>“Are <em> you </em>in the environmental field? That doesn’t sound like you at all. Finally got tired of studying the bad guys, hon?”</p><p>Again with the fucking pet name.</p><p>"No, I'm the guest of honor, so to speak." Agatha answered sharply. "I'm going back inside. I'll see you on campus, Yelena."</p><p>Agatha turned her back on the three of them, but before she could reach the gate of the house, she felt fingers gripping her wrist. Fingers she knew all too well; fingers she would have killed to feel again, if it were almost ten years ago.</p><p>“Why don’t you two go ahead? I’ll catch up with you, Yelena.” Natasha murmured, glancing at Yelena and nodding toward the house.</p><p>Yelena, like an obedient younger sister, smiled at Rio. “Let’s go, Rio, I’m dying for an American beer.”</p><p>Rio scowled but had no excuse not to go with the blonde, so she left, leaving the exes alone.</p><p>“What the fuck do you want? What are you even doing here?” Agatha asked harshly, pulling Natasha’s hand off her arm as if it burned.</p><p>“I see you’re still mad— I didn’t know you’d be here, Agatha. I just came to accompany my sister. You don’t need to get so angry about it.”</p><p>“Well, I’m here. You’re here. Are we done?”</p><p>Agatha never thought she’d see that face again, the one she had once been hopelessly in love with. And though she had moved on from the breakup— it had been almost a decade, for fuck’s sake— she couldn’t help but feel a pang of anguish seeing Natasha again.</p><p>It hadn’t been an amicable breakup, and to this day, Agatha still couldn’t fully understand the reasons behind Natasha’s decision to end their engagement overnight and return to Russia.</p><p>“I’ll be staying in Westview for a while, and I’d love for us to talk. Amicably, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Sure, because I have so much to say to you that I’ve been keeping in a little notebook in my drawer. It’s a bit dusty after ten years, but I think I can still read it.”</p><p>Natasha chuckled and shook her head, looking at Agatha as if she were a fucking comedian. “I see you haven’t changed a bit.”</p><p>“No, I haven’t. Now that you’re aware of that, are you buying your airline ticket already?”</p><p>“Oh stop it, hon, I come in peace, I swear.”</p><p>Agatha took such a deep breath that she physically felt a sharp pain in her chest.</p><p>“Don’t ever call me that again. I have nothing to say to you, and I highly doubt I’d want to hear whatever bullshit you have to tell me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going inside.”</p><p>Agatha did not wait for a response. She simply crossed her arms to keep Natasha from grasping her again and walked away, her steps quick and determined.</p><p>She could feel Natasha following behind, still persistent. The moment she stepped through the gate, she was met with the sight of Rio, Yelena, Jen, Alice, and a few other students she didn’t recognize, all engaged in conversation.</p><p>Rio’s expression was hard, her brows lifting slightly as she took in the scene— Agatha barely holding herself back from sprinting away, with Natasha right on her heels.</p><p>After passing through the outdoor kitchen, Agatha reached a closed glass door that separated the backyard from the house. Jen had likely left it shut for a reason, but Agatha pushed it open forcefully and stepped inside.</p><p>The interior was dark, with only the dim glow of a distant hallway faintly lighting her way. She moved forward, searching for a room where she could be alone, preferably far from her ex. But Natasha was faster than she expected, catching up with her before she could slip away.</p><p>“Agatha, stop! Just fucking stop!” Natasha’s voice echoed down the dimly lit hallway.</p><p>Agatha halted, her eyes darting in search of one last escape route, only to find none. Frustrated, she spun around abruptly, coming face-to-face with Natasha, who was close enough that her familiar perfume— the same one she had worn throughout their seven years together— reached Agatha’s nose.</p><p>“What? What could you possibly want from me? Do you want to talk? Fine. Go ahead. Talk. Let it all out. And then leave me the fuck alone.” Her voice rose near the end, teetering on the edge of a scream.</p><p>Natasha’s expression shifted, losing the playful edge it had carried until now. She took a step closer, but Agatha immediately backed away.</p><p>Fortunately, before Natasha could say anything Agatha had no interest in hearing, Rio appeared in the hallway, moving just as fast as they had moments earlier. </p><p>“Yelena is asking for you.”</p><p>“Tell her to wait. I’ll be right there.” Natasha replied, not even bothering to look at Rio.</p><p>Rio, however, ignored her, walking past Natasha and positioning herself firmly at Agatha’s side. “You should go. Now.”</p><p>Natasha shook her head, waiting for Agatha to say something. When the silence stretched for too long, she huffed, muttered something in Russian, and spun on her heels, leaving the house’s interior.</p><p>Agatha felt like she could finally breathe for the first time since leaving the alley with Rio. Leaning against the wall, she took several deep breaths, grounding herself in the simple fact that Rio was still there.</p><p>Rio gave her a moment before finally speaking.</p><p>“What the fuck was that? You know what— Let’s leave. I’ll drop you off at your house.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She simply nodded and started walking toward the exit.</p><p>The familiar and unfamiliar faces around them weren’t sober enough to notice the two of them leaving together— not side by side, since Agatha was walking much faster than Rio.</p><p>To be honest, Agatha wasn’t even in the right state of mind to care.</p><p>She didn’t know which of the many cars belonged to Rio, so she stopped on the sidewalk and waited for her to take the lead before following.</p><p>Agatha got into the car and, once in the passenger seat, leaned her head back against the seat, pressing her fingers to her temples as a headache slowly crept in. She barely registered Rio starting the engine and only realized they were moving when Rio finally broke the silence.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha—“</p><p>“Rio, I don’t want to talk about it, okay?”</p><p>Her phone rang, but she hastily ignored it and turned her face to the window.</p><p>Rio kept her eyes on the road, respecting Agatha’s wish for silence the entire drive. She didn’t say a word until she pulled up in front of Agatha’s house.</p><p>The street was dark and quiet, so when Rio turned off the engine and unbuckled her seatbelt, the absence of noise felt almost deafening. She shifted in her seat, turning to look at Agatha.</p><p>“Please talk to me. About anything, we don’t have to talk about what happened there.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and unbuckled her seatbelt. She turned to face Rio, who was visibly concerned, her brown eyes almost black in the dim light that filtered into the car. Agatha didn’t think. She just reached out, placed her hand on Rio’s neck, and kissed her.</p><p>Although Rio hadn’t been expecting it, she didn’t hesitate. She kissed Agatha back with the same intensity, and within moments, the two were making out, hands sliding over each other’s bodies as much as their positions in the car allowed.</p><p>Rio jumped over the gear shift and settled herself on Agatha's lap, who struggled with the seat lever, trying to lower it but failing. Agatha grunted in frustration, and Rio pulled back just enough to stretch her arm, adjusting the passenger seat to recline it all the way back until it touched the back seat.</p><p>Agatha quickly shrugged off Rio’s blazer, who was already working her fingers to undo the button on Agatha’s pants and start pulling them down. Agatha lifted herself as much as she could from the seat with Rio’s weight on top of her, and it took four hands to finally get Agatha down to just her panties and the top half of her outfit.</p><p>Whether it was the alcohol she’d consumed, the exhilaration of having Rio on top of her again, or the stress and frustration of seeing her ex after years— Agatha couldn’t tell. What she did know was that she needed to feel Rio’s fingers and mouth on her, and so, when Rio squeezed herself as much as she could into the space between the car’s dashboard and the seat, Agatha leaned back as far as she could and bent her legs.</p><p>Rio didn’t have the same patience for removing Agatha’s panties as she did with her pants, and the sound of fabric tearing echoed through the car. Agatha didn’t have time to protest because Rio’s mouth was already on her pussy. She pressed her lips together to keep from moaning audibly.</p><p>Rio’s hands gripped Agatha’s thighs, spreading them wider. Her tongue traced a slow, deliberate path before closing around her clit. Agatha moaned and her hands tangled Rio’s hair, pulling her even further against her cunt.</p><p>She sucked as her tongue flicked and circled with precision. Rio slipped two fingers inside her, curling them, and started thrusting with relentless force. Agatha’s hips bucked involuntarily, her breath coming in ragged gasps.</p><p>Agatha’s body tensed, and her legs began to tremble until her orgasm hit her in waves, leaving her shaking amidst moans that repeatedly called out Rio’s name over and over.</p><p>Rio’s mouth never left her, licking her clean, and when she was satisfied enough, she took the fingers that had been inside Agatha and brought them to her mouth. Agatha watched, mesmerized. To avoid saying the only words that came to mind, which sounded a lot like worship, she pulled Rio back up to her and kissed her.</p><p>Tasting herself on Rio’s tongue was addictive, and the two only pulled their lips apart when they were both breathing heavily.</p><p>Agatha unzipped Rio’s pants and gestured for them to switch positions, which proved to be quite challenging, with both of them bumping their heads on the car’s ceiling and getting their feet tangled in the gearshift multiple times.</p><p>They didn’t speak a word, moving in a rhythm that seemed like they knew exactly what the other was thinking. On top of Rio, the light illuminated her face a bit, allowing Agatha to see the wetness on her cheeks and chin from Agatha’s release. She had never looked so beautiful in Agatha’s eyes, who leaned in to kiss her again.</p><p>Between the haze of her orgasm and her tongue in Rio’s mouth, it took four knocks on the window for them to realize the noise was coming from outside the car.</p><p>Agatha jumped back, hitting her head so hard on the car’s ceiling that she let out a groan of pain. She turned to the window and saw Wanda standing on the sidewalk with her arms crossed.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. </p><p>Agatha looked down at herself and, at the very least, her blazer covered her ass and cunt, but it didn’t take a genius to notice she wasn’t wearing pants. Fuck.</p><p>Wanda turned her back to the car, giving Agatha a chance to regain some of her dignity, and she quickly searched for her pants to put them back on. Rio, for the second time that night, was speechless.</p><p>“Fucking night. Fuck— go home, Rio.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio said in a hoarse voice, pulling her legs back to give Agatha more space to put on her pants, which took a few minutes due to the lack of space and Agatha’s frantic movements.</p><p>“Yes, go home. We’ll talk tomorrow.” </p><p>Now dressed again— except for her panties, but Wanda didn’t need to know that— Agatha opened the car door and walked around to the porch where Wanda was waiting with a look she had seen only a few times before, but never directed at her.</p><p>“You could’ve just called.” Agatha said nonchalantly, running her hands through her hair to make it look more presentable, less obvious that she had just got fucked in a car.</p><p>“I did. You didn’t answer.”</p><p>Oh, right, the call Agatha had ignored on her way home. She was full of great decisions that day.</p><p>She didn’t say anything else, too focused on unlocking her door as Rio’s car started up again and disappeared down the street.</p><p>“Agatha, what the hell are you doing?”</p><p>“Where’s Nicky?” Agatha ignored the question, stepping into her house with Wanda following close behind.</p><p>“I came to let you know that he wants to sleep over at my place with the boys because Vis wants to take them to breakfast at that new place that just opened—Agatha, what’s happening?”</p><p>“What do you think, Wanda? I’ve been fucking Rio. For weeks now,” Agatha replied, placing her hand on her hip as she turned to face Wanda. “I don’t want to talk about this. Not now, not in an hour. So please, let me sleep for ten hours straight, and you can say whatever you want another time.”</p><p>“You bet your ass I have a lot to say about this.” Wanda muttered before storming out, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>After a scalding hot shower, Agatha tossed and turned in bed, her wet hair dampening her pillow. Her phone lit up the dark room. She turned over, expecting a text from Rio, which she planned to ignore.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

<p>“I don’t give a damn, Paul. First, you fuck up with his science project, and now you decide which weekends you want to take our son? No, that’s not happening.”</p><p>Agatha spoke into the car’s speaker, her voice sharp as she drove toward Wanda’s house to pick up Nicky.</p><p>“I have been swamped with work, Agatha. I had meetings all day yesterday. What was I supposed to do with Nicky?" Paul's voice came through the car's speaker.</p><p>“Not my problem! I organize my schedule around the days I have Nicky, so what’s so hard about you doing the same? I’m almost at Wanda’s house— am I taking him home with me, or should I drop him off at yours? You told him you’d take him to the movies.”</p><p>Agatha could hear Paul’s breathing as he hesitated.</p><p>“Drop him off at my house, but it'll take me a little over an hour to get there. Is that okay with you?"</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha replied before hanging up and pulling over on Wanda’s street.</p><p>In front of Wanda’s house, Agatha rang the doorbell, tapping her foot against the ground as she waited. With any luck, Vision would be the one to answer, with Nicky in tow, so she could get her son and retreat to the peace of her silent car, without having to exchange a single word with Wanda.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the redhead who opened the door.</p><p>“Come in.” Wanda stepped aside, leaving enough space for Agatha to enter. She did, immediately scanning the unusually quiet house for her son.</p><p>Anticipating Agatha’s question, Wanda spoke first. “They’re not home yet. I told Vis to stall a bit so we could talk. Let’s go to the kitchen. I just made some coffee.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and followed the redhead, taking a seat at the kitchen counter, where a cup of coffee was already waiting for her. Still silent, Wanda gave her a moment, letting Agatha take the lead in the conversation. But when it became clear that wasn’t going to happen, Wanda planted herself on the other side of the counter, hands pressed firmly against the surface.</p><p>“How long have you been seeing her?”</p><p>“Since the first time I slept with her."</p><p>Wanda didn’t need to know about the fights, the jealousy, or any of it. Agatha just wanted to get this conversation over with.</p><p>“Why did you lie to me?”</p><p>“I didn’t. Technically. I just didn’t tell you we were still seeing each other."</p><p>“That’s bull, Agatha. Yesterday, I even mentioned her to you, and you made it seem like it was nothing. There was a reason she was staring at you the entire time then.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and folded her arms.</p><p>“You wanna know why I didn’t tell you? Because you’ve been fucking judgmental since the moment I first brought it up. I don’t need to hear whatever you have to say about this. Believe me, every single thought you have has already crossed my mind.”</p><p>“If you’ve thought so much about this and don’t even want to hear what I have to say, then why the hell are you still with her?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, not entirely sure of her own answer. Why was she still holding on to Rio despite the fights? Despite how challenging it was to see her both on campus and outside of it?</p><p>As terrifying as the idea of her colleagues and students finding out about their relationship was, Agatha had developed a taste for the thrill. And, of course, the fact that Rio was so damn good in bed left little room for doubts— every orgasm Rio gave her pushed those uncertainties further to the back of her mind.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“I appreciate her company,” she said, and Wanda raised her eyebrows so high they nearly touched her hairline. “Not sexually, you perv. Although… It's pretty great.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, and Agatha hid her smile behind her coffee cup.</p><p>“Are you serious with her? I mean, are you guys dating?”</p><p>“I'm far too old to date, let alone have a relationship. It is just casual. I'm too busy right now to waste time in a committed relationship.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, and Agatha could practically see the gears in her brain working overtime. She wasn’t about to get into why Wanda didn’t like Rio— especially because she had an even bigger bomb to drop before the kids got back.</p><p>“You left at the right time. Hell, I should’ve left with you. Would’ve spared me from running into our beloved Natasha Romanoff.” Agatha spoke sarcastically, and nothing was more satisfying than seeing Wanda’s reaction.</p><p>Wanda met Natasha at the peak of their relationship, and she grew to hate her even more than Agatha did when Natasha decided to break Agatha’s heart and take more than half of it with her in a suitcase to another continent.</p><p>Hearing the news, Wanda’s eyes went so wide they nearly popped out of their sockets. She slammed her hands on the counter, accidentally knocking over the cup and sending coffee flying everywhere.</p><p>“WHAT? Natasha? Your Natasha? What on earth?”</p><p>Agatha wiped the coffee splashes— which, by the way, were still pretty hot— off her arm with her fingertips, while Wanda completely ignored the mess spreading across the counter and floor.</p><p>“Not mine, it hasn’t been in a very long time. But yes, she was there. Her little sister is in an exchange program at the university.”</p><p>“Did you talk to her at all? Gosh— did you slap her? Please say you did!”</p><p>Agatha laughed because, not ironically, she had spent a good part of her sleepless night thinking she should have taken advantage of the moment alone with Natasha to do exactly that— beat the crap out of her. Just for old times’ sake.</p><p>“I should have. Maybe I would’ve done it if Rio hadn’t pulled me out of there.”</p><p>“Does Rio know about your history with Natasha?”</p><p>“No, nothing. She asked some questions, but I wasn’t in the right headspace for it.”</p><p>“Yeah, you two didn’t exactly look like you were talking.” Wanda smirked, earning a glare from Agatha.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Are you going to clean that?” Agatha gestured toward the spilled coffee, but before Wanda could answer, the sound of the front door creaking open caught their attention. Three boys came running in, clearly on a sugar rush.</p><p>The twins bolted toward the living room, and soon, the sound of the television filled the house. Nicky, however, likely recognizing the car parked outside, headed straight for the kitchen with curious eyes until they landed on Agatha. The moment he saw her, a bright smile spread across his face, and he ran toward her. She stood up just in time to catch him in a firm hug.</p><p>“Hi, sweetie. How did you spend the night?” she asked, bending down to kiss the top of his head. He remained securely wrapped around her waist.</p><p>“It was fun! We watched Spider-Man, and Uncle Vis made caramel popcorn. We stayed up super late because Billy threw up like twenty times. It was so gross.”</p><p>Both women laughed.</p><p>“I bet. Why don’t you go grab your things? I’ll take you to your dad’s in a bit.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t seem as excited as he usually was at the prospect of going to his father’s house, and Agatha tried not to let that get to her. She forced a reassuring smile, and he nodded before heading off to gather his things.</p><p>Alone again, Agatha turned to Wanda, who was wiping down the counter.</p><p>“I know I don’t have to say this, but here it goes: don’t mention anything about Rio to anyone, okay?”</p><p>“Only if you promise to tell me if that Russian demon shows up again.”</p><p>Agatha let out a loud laugh. “I will.”</p><p>A few minutes later, she was in the car with Nicky, heading for Paul's home. He didn't want to talk about why he was so reluctant about going to his father's, and she didn't push him, choosing to respect his space.</p><p>Dropping Nicky off turned out to be much quicker than she’d expected, considering Paul was in the shower, and it was his wife who answered the door— his wife who absolutely despised Agatha’s existence. Apparently, that was the kind of hatred you earned when your friend cheated on their spouse with you and, as the cherry on top, got a child out of it.</p><p>-</p><p>In the solitude of her home, Agatha was lounging on the couch in sweatpants, drinking her third glass of wine, and watching a random season of Grey’s Anatomy— somewhere between the fifth and the twentieth. She had given up keeping track after the death of her eighth favorite character.</p><p>Her phone, abandoned on the coffee table, started vibrating. Ever since she’d changed the unknown number’s contact name to Russian Demon, a chill ran down her spine every time the damn thing lit up.</p><p>It was Rio.</p><p>“Hello.” Agatha answered, pausing the show.</p><p>“Hey gorgeous. What have you been up to?”</p><p>“Binge-watching Meredith Grey and her highly questionable life choices.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, and Agatha couldn't help but smile at the sound.</p><p>“Not exactly kid-friendly entertainment, but okay…”</p><p>“Nicky’s not here.”</p><p>A brief silence.</p><p>“In that case… mind some company?”</p><p>Agatha smiled against the rim of her glass.</p><p>“Bring food. And let yourself in— I’m not getting up."</p><p>“See you soon, m’lady.”</p><p>She felt like a teenager but couldn’t fight the giddy smile spreading across her lips. Glancing down at her oversized sweats, she sighed. Nope, she wasn’t about to put in any extra effort to look more presentable. Rio knew exactly what to expect from someone who had just admitted to spending hours glued to the TV.</p><p>Less than an hour later, Agatha heard the front door open, and soon after, Rio appeared beside the couch, a smirk stretching across her lips as she took in the sight of Agatha, so far removed from the near-impeccable image she carried on campus.</p><p>“Having fun?” </p><p>Agatha turned her head toward Rio, noticing the two pizza boxes in her hands and a bag that smelled divinely of garlic and cheese.</p><p>“After a few glasses of wine, Mark Sloan’s death stresses me out more than it makes me sad. So, yeah. A lot of fun.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, setting the food down on the coffee table before settling onto the couch. Agatha, still sprawled out, tucked her legs in to make room, but Rio, unfazed by the limited space, simply grasped her ankles, wordlessly inviting her to stretch them across her lap.</p><p>Thanks to the wine already working its magic, Agatha didn’t have to try too hard to feel comfortable with her legs draped over Rio’s lap. Rio absentmindedly traced slow strokes from her ankle to her knee.</p><p>“I felt bad about last night,” Rio admitted after a few moments of silence, her eyes still fixed on the TV. “How bad was the talk with Maximoff? I mean, she already knew about us, so it couldn’t have been that much of a shock.”</p><p>Agatha held the bag of garlic bread in her hands, taking a bite of one to give herself a moment before answering.</p><p>“It wasn’t one of my greatest moments, but it’s fine.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look convinced.</p><p>“Really, Rio, it’s fine.”</p><p>They went back to watching TV in silence. Nearly ten minutes passed, both finishing off the garlic bread, and Rio was now reaching for the pizza.</p><p>“And what about the other event from last night?” Rio asked, handing Agatha a slice of pizza.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, knowing there was no way to dodge the conversation, and it wasn’t fair to Rio either. She had been caught off guard and forced to play nice with the sister of Agatha’s ex. </p><p>Fuck, what a mess.</p><p>“What do you want to know?” Agatha asked, and Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical that it would be that easy. “Ask, and I’ll answer. Though I can’t promise I’ll answer everything.”</p><p>Rio had eaten nearly half of her pizza while Agatha stared at the TV screen when she spoke again.</p><p>“When did you break up?”</p><p>“About nine years ago.”</p><p>“Who broke up with who?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, her voice shifting to a more sober tone. “She broke up with me.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Beats me.”</p><p>Rio reached for another slice of pizza for the two of them.</p><p>“Do you still have feelings for her?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her as if she were clinically insane.</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>“I noticed how you reacted when you saw her— it’s a fair question.”</p><p>Agatha finished her wine and refilled her glass.</p><p>“She broke up with me one day, gave me back the engagement ring the next, and left for Russia less than twelve hours later. I never saw her again until yesterday. I think I reacted pretty well, all things considered.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and they finished eating in silence. Agatha stood up to get a glass for Rio and a new bottle of wine. </p><p>When she returned, Rio had stretched out on the spot where Agatha had been just moments before, and Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“Lie here with me.” Rio patted the cushion in front of her.</p><p>The couch wasn’t wide enough, and even with Agatha nearly at the edge of it, her body was still completely pressed against Rio’s, both of them lying on their sides facing the TV.</p><p>Rio’s arm was propped up, supporting her head, and it should have been uncomfortable for her to stay in that position every time she reached for her wine. Agatha would grab the glass and set it back on the coffee table each time Rio wanted a sip. But Rio never complained.</p><p>At some point during the episode, Rio’s hand slid over Agatha’s waist, pulling her firmly against her body. Rio rested her head on the arm of the couch, and her nose was so close to the back of Agatha's neck that she could feel Rio’s warm breath, sending a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“Getting bored?” Agatha asked when she realized that with the position Rio was in, she could barely see a sliver of the TV screen.</p><p>“Nope.” Rio answered, unabashedly smelling Agatha's neck, who was genuinely trying to focus, but by that point, the medical ramblings were just background noise in her mind.</p><p>Another shiver ran through Agatha, causing her hairs to stand on end as she turned toward Rio, their foreheads nearly touching. Rio smiled, nibbling on Agatha's lower lip before kissing her softly. The kiss was gentle, even as Rio traced the tip of her tongue along Agatha’s lips, who immediately parted them to let her in.</p><p>Agatha placed her hand on Rio's cheek, softly caressing it with her fingertips, feeling Rio’s tongue explore her mouth as if it were the first time.</p><p>When they pulled away, Rio opened her eyes just as Agatha did, and Rio stifled a laugh.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brow. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing—“</p><p>“Rio, what?”</p><p>“Your eyes are so blue that even in this low light, they look like two flashlights shining right at me." Rio said, laughing, causing Agatha to snort in response.</p><p>“You’re such a dork.” Agatha snorted again, with Rio still smiling, planting soft kisses on her lips and the small dimple in her chin.</p><p>“I was wondering…” Rio began, her lips brushing against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Mhm…” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“There’s a bar in Eastview I’ve been dying to check out, and I was wondering what it would take to convince you to go with me.”</p><p>“Eastview, huh?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“I know better than to ask you to go to a bar in Westview.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, blowing air into Rio's face as she continued receiving soft kisses from the student.</p><p>"So, what do you say? Next Friday? I’ll pick you up. But just a heads-up: you’re coming back to my house afterward."</p><p>“Your house? Not happening. Not again.” </p><p>"So, yes to the bar, and no to my place? Fair enough. We’ll go back to yours.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, silently giggling, joined by Rio's easy laughter, who seemed like the happiest person in the world just at the thought of going to that damn bar together.</p><p>After a few more rounds of make-out sessions on the couch that was way too small for them to be doing that, Rio started making bolder moves; slipping her hand under Agatha's sweats, just below her breast, squeezing the area gently.</p><p>“Baby— You should get going. My day starts very early tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio pouted, running her nails lightly over Agatha's ribs. “What if… I sleep over?”</p><p>“Tonight?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>"You, Rio Vidal, are actually going to wake up early so you have time to grab your stuff from your place and head to university?" Agatha arched an eyebrow, a teasing smile playing on her lips.</p><p>“What if I told you I already have all my stuff in my car?”</p><p>“Really? You came that prepared? So sure you were going to sleep at my house?”</p><p>Rio let out a loud, long cackle, and Agatha realized that a high-pitched laugh wasn’t truly an issue for her. Not when it came from Rio.</p><p>“Not just at your house, but in your bed if you want to make a woman very happy tonight.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and got up from the couch. She held out her hand to assist Rio up and lead her to her bedroom, intending to clean up the pizza and wine mess the next day. For the time being, there were far more important things to focus on.</p><p>-</p><p>Nearly two hours later, Agatha lay on her back, sweaty, naked, with her hair a tangled mess. Rio wasn’t much better, breathing heavily beside her.  Before Rio, Agatha had become unaccustomed to cumming many times in a row, but evidently, it was as simple as riding a bike; her pussy quickly regained its familiarity and was now thoroughly spoiled by Rio's hands and mouth.</p><p>Agatha was the first to fall asleep, resting on her stomach with her face to the wall. </p><p>Rio resisted sleeping as hard as she could, relishing Agatha's rare moments of vulnerability. She took advantage of the moment, gently stroking her back and running her fingers through her long dark hair.</p><p>As it grew increasingly difficult to stay awake, Rio took her time shifting Agatha without awakening her, eventually holding her from behind, her face nestled into Agatha's neck. Only then did Rio finally drift off to sleep.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha turned off the alarm on her phone, which sat on the nightstand, and rubbed her eyes, irritated by the strands of hair tickling her face, neck, and chest. It took her a moment to realize the strands were a shade lighter than her own— she was, in fact, tugging at Rio’s hair. </p><p>Rio mumbled in her sleep, nuzzling even deeper into Agatha’s neck.</p><p>She tried to push Rio away so she could get out of bed, but somehow, Rio was more persistent than any sleeping person had the right to be. Her arm draped over Agatha, hand slipping between her back and the mattress, effectively trapping her in place.</p><p>Agatha had intended to let Rio sleep in as long as possible— she had set her alarm earlier than usual to get everything sorted before leaving for work. But Rio was making it very difficult for Agatha to be nice to her.</p><p>She shifted in bed a few times, expecting Rio to get annoyed by the movement and roll over to the other side. Rio did wake up, yes. But Agatha only realized it when she felt soft kisses trailing over her bare shoulders, followed by a murmured, “Good morning.”</p><p>The intimacy and domesticity of that simple act made Agatha freeze completely. She felt the familiar ache twisting in her stomach and alarms ringing in her head, telling her to pack up her shit and run.</p><p>If she cared enough to see a therapist, maybe she’d know how to deal with her deep-seated issues with intimacy and trust— issues she wasn’t naive enough to think didn’t originate directly from childhood. After all, growing up under Evanora’s care (okay, strong word— under the same roof), Agatha had somehow turned out to be a surprisingly functional person.</p><p>In her defense, she had spent years in therapy when she was younger to help her cope with the pressures of academic life and her interpersonal relationships. She had improved significantly, especially after she started dating Natasha.</p><p>However, after Natasha dumped her without so much as an explanation, Agatha figured she might as well do the same with everything she had built within herself through years of therapy. Coincidence or not, she hadn’t had another long-term relationship since.</p><p>She hadn’t even realized she’d drifted off until Rio called her— probably not for the first time— pressing soft kisses to her shoulder.</p><p>“Sweetheart? Still there?” Rio glanced at Agatha, who was staring at the ceiling. Agatha cocked her head to see Rio sleep-swollen, with her hair sticking out in all directions. Agatha found it endearing.</p><p>“Yeah— I need to start getting ready.” She made a move to get up, and Rio let her, shifting back and settling against the headboard.</p><p>Agatha got out of bed, and Rio, still naked, the blanket only covering her up to the waist, left the entire top half of her body exposed, immediately catching Agatha’s gaze. Rio smirked at how quickly Agatha's eyes dropped to her nipples, hard from the chilly morning air.</p><p>Agatha was the first to move, forcing her traitorous eyes back to Rio’s face, who seemed to revel in the sight of Agatha openly admiring her body. Without a word, Agatha turned away and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>With Rio somewhere downstairs, Agatha took longer than usual to get ready for her day. Her hair, slightly wavy and no longer a wild mess down her back, framed her face. She slipped into an olive-green suit, a tailored blazer with a deep V-neckline and matching slim-fit slacks.</p><p>With her makeup done, Agatha walked down the stairs, phone and charger in hand, placing them on the table near the front door. She headed to the kitchen to grab something quick, only to be met with an unexpected sight: Rio, standing there in the same clothes from the night before, her hair no longer a mess, holding a slice of cold pizza in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other.</p><p>“Odd combination,” Agatha remarked as she walked over to the coffee machine to pour herself a cup.</p><p>“Cold pizza for breakfast? It’s my favorite. Want one?” </p><p>Agatha wrinkled her nose. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio merely shrugged, eating her slice and taking a sip of coffee between bites. To avoid openly judging Rio for her dubious breakfast choices, Agatha retreated to her office to gather some materials she needed to take to the university.</p><p>As she sorted documents into folders and slipped them into her oversized bag, Agatha didn’t notice Rio had entered the office and was making her way toward her, deliberately making noise to avoid startling her.</p><p>“You’re looking very hot.” Rio said, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist from behind.</p><p>“Well, thank you.” She replied, still focused on organizing the scattered papers and folders on her desk.</p><p>Rio grabbed the long gold necklace Agatha was wearing and gave it a tug, forcing her to turn away from the desk and face her instead. Agatha huffed, meeting Rio’s gaze, now standing a few inches shorter than her thanks to Agatha’s heels.</p><p>“You’re killing me looking like that.” Rio said, biting her lower lip, her gaze trailing down the length of Agatha’s outfit, lingering on the exposed skin from the deep V-neckline.</p><p>“Like what?</p><p>“Like Agatha Harkness.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the slight twitch at the corner of her lips betrayed her amusement. </p><p>“It’s not because you’ve seen me waking up in the morning that you need to be so flabbergasted when I’m all put together.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers touching the lapels of Agatha’s blazer.</p><p>“You always look beautiful. I mean, there’s just a different energy when you’re dressed as Professor Agatha Harkness. No wonder so many students are so drawn to you. Believe me, I’ve heard some filthy comments.” She took a deep breath, getting closer, her lips grazing Agatha’s ear, “And seeing you like this… Makes me so, so wet.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, holding back a moan just from Rio's words. </p><p>She was aware of her appearance and how some students, whether boys or girls, took a little longer to look away when they passed her on campus. Or how some would stare at her during class in a way that made it obvious they weren't paying attention to her words, but to her face and body. She wouldn't admit it, but she reveled in the power her position gave her.</p><p>Casually, Agatha smirked and checked the time on her wristwatch, then murmured, her voice lower and more commanding, “Get on your knees.” </p><p>Rio knelt before her without a second of hesitation, and her fingers quickly worked to undo the single button on Agatha’s pants, pulling them down to the floor. Her movements were almost frenzied, as if Agatha may change her mind at any time and she needed to seize the opportunity before that happened.</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the edge of the desk, her hands gripping the wooden surface for support as Rio hooked her fingers into the waistband of Agatha’s panties, pulling them down her legs and letting them drop to the floor.</p><p>“Hold my hair for me, Professor?” Rio grinned, her warm hands moving from Agatha’s heels up to her thighs, spreading them wider.</p><p>Agatha’s hand grabbed a fistful of Rio’s hair and held it so tightly that Rio winced. Rio’s breath ghosted over her before finally making contact—a teasing lick along the length of her pussy that drew a soft moan from Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha spread her legs even wider, her other hand gripping the edge of the table for support as Rio kissed her cunt with her tongue.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, that’s it,” Agatha moaned out, pulling Rio even harder against her pussy with firm tugs on her hair</p><p>Rio hummed in response and angled her head down, letting her nose press against Agatha’s clit as she began fucking her with her tongue.</p><p>“ohmygod—fuck, baby, don’t you dare to stop—“</p><p>Rio’s jaw must have been aching, but Agatha held her firmly in place, completely lost in the sensation of Rio’s tongue relentlessly thrusting into her cunt.</p><p>Agatha’s legs began to tremble, and Rio’s hands moved to her hips, holding her steady. Agatha had to remove her hand from Rio’s hair and place it on the table behind her for support.</p><p>Free from Agatha’s grasp, Rio returned her tongue to where it had been before, her lips closing around Agatha’s clit to suck gently, the pressure just enough to make Agatha’s hips buck forward.</p><p>If Agatha hadn’t had her eyes closed amidst moans and babbling dirty nothings, she would have seen how relieved Rio was to get out of that position, her jaw making a cracking noise as she closed it to focus on Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Rio, god, make me cum all over your face—“</p><p>Rio’s tongue started working faster, alternating between broad strokes and quick, focused flicks. One of her hands slid down to Agatha’s ass, digging her nails into it, and Agatha moaned even louder.</p><p>“Yes—Rio, yes, fuck yes, don’t stop,” were Agatha’s last words before an orgasm hit her with brutal force. Her head fell back, and she slumped against the desk. Rio kept going, her tongue making slow circles around Agatha’s clit, careful not to overstimulate it, while Agatha gasped for air.</p><p>Agatha came down from her high, and Rio was already starting to incite her again with harder licks to her pussy, her hands massaging, squeezing, and scratching her ass. Agatha grabbed Rio’s hair again and forced her to stand up. </p><p>Rio had a mischievous smile on her face. She ran her tongue over her own lips, her face glistening with Agatha’s release, including mouth, chin, cheek, and nose.</p><p>“I wish I had the time to fuck you the way you deserve,” Agatha mumbled, grabbing Rio's chin with very little gentleness and sweeping her tongue over her lips. Rio moaned.</p><p>“Is that an invitation for me to come back later? Careful, Professor Harkness, or I just might.”</p><p>Both of them smiled as Rio lowered herself again. Agatha opened her mouth to remind her that she really needed to leave for work when Rio surprised her by gently pulling her panties and slacks back into place.</p><p>Agatha ran her hand through her own hair, smoothing it down while Rio buttoned her pants, not before giving a light kiss to her pussy over her panties.</p><p>With her clothes back in place, Agatha finished organizing the hundreds of papers while Rio went to the restroom. When she got back, she cleared her throat just as Agatha zipped up her bag and slung it over her shoulder.</p><p>“I wasn’t kidding, you know?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, puzzled.</p><p>“About coming back here tonight. I know you won’t go to my place with Alice there, and, you know, you’re alone this week.” Rio smiled, her cheeks tinged with the slightest hint of pink.</p><p>“If you stay over tonight, are you cooking?”</p><p>“What? Why? We still have some pizza left!”</p><p>“You’re seriously telling me you had pizza for dinner, then breakfast, and now you want it again for dinner?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “What can I say? I really like pizza.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, an amused smile playing on her lips as she started walking toward the door, Rio right beside her.</p><p>“I’m going to ignore you for your own good,” Agatha muttered, earning a cackle from Rio. “I won’t be able to have lunch with you today, so I’ll text you when I’m leaving the campus.”</p><p>Thanks to Rio, the looming threat of the Russian Demon showing up on campus had been reduced to nothing more than a minor burden in the back of her mind. But with her impending return to work, what had once been a small concern was now spiraling into a full-blown anxiety crisis.</p><p>So no, Agatha wouldn’t risk staying in her office a second longer than necessary.</p><p>Rio nodded as they both stopped in front of the still-closed door, and Agatha finished tucking a few last things into her bag. </p><p>Rio stepped closer, and just as Agatha seemed ready to leave, she wrapped an arm around her waist.</p><p>“Have mercy on your students today, sweetheart,” Rio teased, drawing a smile from Agatha. They shared a brief kiss.</p><p>“As long as you promise to stop hugging the campus trees— they’re already getting worn out because of you hippies,” Agatha shot back.</p><p> Rio laughed and kissed her again.</p><p>“Later, baby,” Agatha said after locking the house and starting to walk toward her own car, with Rio doing the same toward hers.</p><p>“See ya, gorgeous.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On Monday, Rio spent the night at Agatha’s place.</p><p>She didn’t cook— not for lack of trying, but because Agatha made the call. Rio gave it a try, but after spending half an hour scrubbing what looked like charcoal crust off the pan from burning the onions not once, but twice, Agatha took over and told Rio to pick a song for them to listen to instead.</p><p>After dinner, with Rio in charge of cleaning up, they settled into each other’s company while working on their respective assignments in Agatha's home office.</p><p>Rio was studying research papers related to her master's project, trying to decide how she would conduct her experiments, while Agatha prepared materials to distribute to her students later that week for the research project’s first meeting.</p><p>-</p><p>On Tuesday, the same routine repeated itself.</p><p>The difference was that this time, Agatha didn’t kid herself into expecting Rio to be in charge of dinner. She cooked, they ate, and Rio cleaned up.</p><p>Agatha had several bells go off in her head throughout those days.</p><p>When Rio kissed her out of nowhere, No warning, just because she felt like it. </p><p>When she was sitting in her office chair, reading something on her laptop, Rio would come by, press a kiss to the top of her head, and leave. </p><p>When, after fucking like rabbits until they were exhausted, Rio wrapped her arms around her and traced soothing patterns until sleep overpowered the lingering edge of anxiety.</p><p>Even in those moments, Agatha tried her best to push the feeling aside and just be present. She didn’t always succeed. And when she couldn’t, she’d retreat to her room or to Nicky’s room, finding distraction in reorganizing a closet or tidying up her son’s toys. Whenever that happened, Rio never pried, never pushed, never even looked at her funny. Her patience was almost medicinal, a quiet balm against the storm in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>-</p><p>On Wednesday, Wanda came over for dinner, breaking the three-night streak of Rio sleeping at Agatha’s house.</p><p>“I barely see you on campus these days. Is your new course keeping you that busy?” Wanda asked, pouring two glasses of wine while Agatha checked on the lasagna in the oven.</p><p>“Yes and no,” Agatha said, lowering the oven temperature before standing up. “I’m just avoiding wandering around campus now that there’s a risk of running into Yelena.”</p><p>“And the Russian Demon?” Wanda grinned, clearly pleased that the nickname had stuck.</p><p>“No sign of her. I hardly stay there outside of my office hours anymore, but William would’ve told me if anyone had come looking for me. It’s pissing me off that I can’t even be in my own fucking office.”</p><p>“If she shows up, just kick her out.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“You clearly don’t want her there, and she has no right to bother you at your workplace. Talk to Lilia if you have to.”</p><p>“I just want her out of this damn town. Out of the state, the country, the fucking continent,” Agatha grumbled, filling her mouth with wine and swallowing it in one go.</p><p>Wanda took a much smaller sip.</p><p>“Just between us… Is she still hot?” </p><p>Agatha nearly spat out her wine, staring at the redhead in disbelief. She could lie, say she had never seen Natasha looking worse. That maybe, at some point in the last nine years, Natasha had caught fire and someone had tried to put it out with a bat.</p><p>Unfortunately, Natasha remained the same seductive woman, with the kind of appeal that turned heads wherever she went.</p><p>“Ugh, yes, which pisses me off even more.” Agatha rolled her eyes, finishing the contents of her glass.</p><p>Wanda laughed and refilled Agatha's glass.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m going to hold your hand while I say this, but— maybe you should get this out of your system once and for all," Wanda said, her fingers playing with the stem of her own glass.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows. “I’m not following.”</p><p>“You know… This whole Natasha situation.”</p><p>Agatha was still confused by what the redhead meant, and her face showed it. Wanda groaned.</p><p>“You should fuck her, Agatha. Like a mad woman. You’re still so angry with her, and she’s in the same town as you after all these years. I think it could be a way to get some closure.”</p><p>
<em> Say-fucking-what?  </em>
</p><p>Agatha was baffled. She stayed silent for a moment, processing her friend's words. She looked at Wanda, a mix of disbelief and turmoil on her face.</p><p>“Excuse me? You want me— to— to f-fuck her?” Agatha asked, still not believing what she was hearing.</p><p>“Exactly what I’m saying. Honestly, I think it would do you some good. This time, you fuck her until she sees stars, and leave her in some random hotel room. And that’s it, no more Natasha. The Russian Demon would never want to step foot in New Jersey again.”</p><p>Agatha had no words to say to Wanda. All she could think about was what Rio would do if she heard all that.</p><p>Rio having a psychotic episode directed toward Wanda was not impossible to imagine. Rio, in the middle of her psychotic episode, threatening and killing Sparky —Wanda’s dog— out of rage, wasn’t far-fetched either.</p><p>“Yeah… I’m not doing that. But really, thank you, awesome advice.” Agatha rolled her eyes, and Wanda just shrugged.</p><p>They finished their wine in silence, with Agatha glancing at the oven glass occasionally, still perplexed by her friend's terrible recommendation.</p><p>“If you didn’t have Vidal, would you consider it? Sleeping with Natasha?” </p><p>Agatha paused, making Wanda's lips curl into a smirk.</p><p>“She fucking broke my heart, Wanda. I need more self-respect than to get into bed with her.”</p><p>“That’s not a no,” Wanda pointed out.</p><p>“And it’s not a yes, so let’s drop it, okay?”</p><p>Wanda raised her hands in surrender and refilled their glasses. The timer went off, signaling that dinner was ready, and Agatha busied herself taking the lasagna out of the oven while Wanda set everything up on the dining table.</p><p>At the table, they chatted about their respective classes at the university, some students they had in common, and the kids. The names of Rio and Natasha were no longer mentioned, much to Agatha's relief.</p><p>-</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, Agatha was jabbing the coffee machine button in the faculty lounge of the Criminal Justice building with a little more force than necessary. By the fifth press, she accepted defeat. The machine wasn’t going to cooperate, and she needed a backup plan for her afternoon caffeine fix.</p><p>Resigned, she made her way to the campus cafeteria, slipping into the line. Her eyes flicked over the menu behind the counter out of habit, though her order never changed. Double espresso.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>“Yelena, hi,” Agatha turned toward the voice, nearly colliding with the woman, who was much closer than she had anticipated. Before she could react, Yelena’s arms were already wrapping around her in an embrace.</p><p>Agatha tensed briefly, taken aback by the startling proximity. Yelena, on the other hand, seemed fully at ease, either unaware of or choosing to ignore Agatha's stiffness.</p><p>Releasing her, Yelena took a spot beside her in line, pointedly ignoring the line of people behind them.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to find you around here, but this first week has been absolute chaos.”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile.</p><p>“No, I bet. It’s fine. Are you settled already?”</p><p>“I wanted to stay in the dorms, you know, get the full experience, but my parents thought it would be better to rent a studio,” Yelena said with a shrug. “It’s all set. Actually, it’s a complete mess,” she laughed. “Nat gave up on staying with me by the second day and moved into a hotel.”</p><p>So, the Russian Demon was still haunting the streets of Westview. Agatha had thought she might have taken off somewhere (preferably to the nine circles of hell) and that’s why she hadn’t shown up yet, but apparently not. Agatha pressed her lips together and was saved by the barista who asked for her order.</p><p>“Double espresso, please,” she turned to Yelena, gesturing for her to say what she wanted.</p><p>“Chocolate milkshake.”</p><p>Agatha wrinkled her nose but held back any comments. Instead, she pulled out her phone to pay, then the two of them moved to the side to wait for their order.</p><p>“My parents asked about you, you know. When I told them we ran into you last weekend. They miss you. My dad even said he’d make an effort to visit now that he knows you’re here.”</p><p>Shit, if that didn’t feel like a punch to the chest.</p><p>Natasha’s (and Yelena’s) parents, despite the cultural and often linguistic barriers, had always treated Agatha with warmth and admiration for her professional achievements. They celebrated every diploma, every certification, every accomplishment, no matter how small or big, with the same enthusiasm. A kind of pride and affection that Evanora had never allowed Agatha to experience.</p><p>Agatha forced her voice to come out, sounding steadier than she actually felt. “I miss them too. How are they? Are they in the States?”</p><p>She remembered that after a lifetime in Russia, their parents had moved to the United States when she and Natasha were already a couple. When Natasha decided to return to Russia, they stayed— but Yelena, always glued to and utterly devoted to her older sister, went back with her.</p><p>“They’re doing great. My dad got relocated to Des Moines, and my mom loves the quiet life there. It’s cold as fuck, guess that makes her feel at home.” Yelena laughed. </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help herself and she laughed too.</p><p>Their order was ready, and with cups in hand, they began walking out of the cafeteria.</p><p>“How are your classes? Harder than back home?” Agatha asked, eager to steer the conversation away from ex-in-laws, Natasha, Russia— anything tied to that family.</p><p>“Not too hard but shitloads of reading and writing.” Yelena replied, making a sound of appreciation as she sipped her milkshake. How she could drink that in the middle of the afternoon and still function afterward was beyond Agatha’s understanding.</p><p>Agatha just shook her head. She was blowing on her coffee when Yelena’s next words nearly made her drop the disposable cup.</p><p>“Rio has been a huge help since I got here, she even asked me to teach her some bad words in Russian, she’s great. By the way, do you happen to know if she’s single?” Before Agatha could even begin to figure out how to reply, Yelena went on, “I already know she’s into women. People say she used to be wild at parties, but it seems she hasn’t been to any in a while. Maybe she’s seeing someone from out of town?”</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>Okay, go back to Natasha and ex-in-laws. Right fucking now.</p><p>With nothing else to do, Agatha took a burning sip of coffee, using the few seconds it gave her to think without making it obvious that she had no idea what to say. The coffee burned her lips, her tongue, her throat, and she couldn’t even grimace.</p><p>Once the coffee settled in her throat, Agatha glanced away from Yelena, blinking away the tears from the pain.</p><p>“I have no idea. We’re not in the same department, as you know, so I don’t see her that often. And she wouldn’t tell me something like that, obviously.”</p><p>“You’re not friends? I saw you two leaving together that day.”</p><p>Agatha gave a half-smile, still feeling the effects of the hot coffee but trying to keep her composure. She forced herself to take a deep breath before speaking.</p><p>“Not that kind of friends.” She caught on to what she had said and widened her eyes. “I mean— she’s not very open with people. We don’t talk about that kind of thing.”</p><p>“What a shame, she’s hot,” Yelena shrugged. “Based on what you do know about her, do you think I have a shot?”</p><p>To make Agatha more uncomfortable than she already was, it would be necessary to shove a cactus up her ass.</p><p>“I really, <em> really </em> don’t know, Yelena. Look, I need to go back—“</p><p>Yelena interrupted her. “I’m coming with you! I have to learn where your office is, right? This place is like a maze.”</p><p>The cactus was coming closer.</p><p>“Your sister seems to know exactly where it is,” Agatha shot back, not even bothering to look at Yelena. She quickened her pace toward her building, forcing the blonde to nearly jog to keep up.</p><p>“She came here? I told her not to! She’s been going on and on about wanting to see you, talk to you, find out how you’re doing— I told her it wasn’t a good idea.”</p><p>“She didn’t. And if you really want to do something for your former sister-in-law, make it crystal clear to her that I don’t want to see her face anywhere near my workplace.” </p><p>“She knows that, Agatha. I don’t know what happened between you two, but that night you made it very clear you don’t wanna see her. I told her she has to respect that.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent for the rest of the walk, while Yelena seemed more focused on finishing her milkshake.</p><p>When they reached her office, Agatha unlocked the door and headed straight for her desk. Yelena, on the other hand, took her time, making a slow circle around the office, scanning each wall, each painting. Her eyes landed on a framed photo of Nicky on Agatha’s desk. She picked it up, her expression a mix of surprise and curiosity.</p><p>Yelena asked, “Who is this?” without paying enough attention to the other photo on Agatha’s desk— one that would have answered her question immediately, showing Nicky on Agatha’s lap.</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“My son.”</p><p>Yelena’s head snapped toward Agatha so fast it was almost possible to hear a crack in her neck.</p><p>“Son? You adopted a child?” </p><p>“No, Yelena. I carried him. For forty weeks and three days, to be exact.”</p><p>Yelena was completely stunned, still gripping the picture frame</p><p>“Does Natasha know you’re a married woman now? Because I don’t think she’d be this greedy to see you if she did— wait, you’re with a man? Or did you do one of those crazy-ass procedures? Like, take something from one woman and put it in another and all that shit?”</p><p>So many ridiculous questions at once that Agatha could swear she had traveled back in time, forced to endure her ex-girlfriend’s younger sister all over again— loud, relentless, and blurting out the most absurd things she had ever heard.</p><p>“I’m not married, and definitely not to a guy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I actually have work to do.” She lifted her laptop screen and tilted her head toward the door, a silent but clear sign for Yelena to get the hell out.</p><p>Yelena placed the picture back on Agatha’s desk. “I’ll talk to her, try to get her to leave you alone, but I can’t make any promises.” She offered a regretful smile before stepping out of the office.</p><p>-</p><p>On Friday morning, Agatha was in her office when an email arrived with the list of all the students who would be attending the short course, including Rio’s and Alice’s names.</p><p>The course was set to begin in a few days, and preparations for it were driving Agatha nuts, who was currently typing a confirmation email for the students.</p><p>A knock on the door drew her attention away from her laptop, and she murmured a quick “Come in.”</p><p>Rio made her usual entrance: slow steps as if she owned the place, tossing her backpack and phone on the sofa, then walking over to Agatha.</p><p>“Hey,” she greeted, leaning over Agatha’s laptop to give her a brief kiss on the lips.</p><p>“Hi. I’m almost done.” Agatha replied, barely glancing at Rio but returning the kiss just the same.</p><p>Rio walked around the desk, ever curious, to snoop at what Agatha was doing. She spotted her own name and smiled, sliding her hands down to rest on Agatha’s thigh, hovering.</p><p>“When am I getting my first private lesson, huh? In case I have some difficulties.” Rio whispered, her nose buried in Agatha’s locks. Rio took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of her hair, and let out a contented hum.</p><p>“Are you planning on failing my class? Just so you know, I won’t play favorites,” Agatha smiled, raising one hand to gently stroke the side of Rio's face.</p><p>“Would never expect you to.” Rio kissed Agatha’s cheek and pulled away.</p><p>Rio lay down on the couch, scrolling on her phone as she waited for Agatha to finish her task. Agatha had written a general email for all the students, and as soon as she hit send, Rio's phone buzzed.</p><p>“Oh my god, the hottest professor in this place just sent me an email! My heart might not take it!” Rio said in a high-pitched voice, placing a hand to her forehead and pretending to faint.</p><p>Agatha snorted and walked over to her, a playful smile on her lips.</p><p>“Such a dork, Jesus.” Agatha gave Rio's heel a little tap to get her to sit properly on the couch, freeing up space for Agatha, who then sat beside her.</p><p>“Your dork.” Rio smirked, leaning her body forward toward Agatha until their lips were merely a few inches apart.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Just kiss me already, I’ve missed you.” Rio said as a request, but didn’t give Agatha the time to decide whether she would kiss her or not, pressing her lips against hers.</p><p>Agatha returned the kiss because, at that point, her body had become addicted to the taste of Rio and, to be honest, craved her.  Their tongues intertwined in a familiar rhythm, with Rio bringing her hands to Agatha’s neck, holding her in place. Not that Agatha had a better place to be.</p><p>After a while, she pulled away from Rio's lips but remained close, her face hovering close to Rio’s as she inhaled the familiar scent of her.</p><p>“I only have a few minutes before I need to go. I have a meeting, and considering this is the only time everyone could make it, I really can’t be late.” Agatha murmured, tucking a strand of Rio’s brown hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Oh yeah, your research project— Alice has been talking my ear off for days, she’s super excited. Doesn’t even seem like she knows you’re freaking insanely tough on your students.” Rio laughed, pulling a hearty laugh from Agatha as well.</p><p>Before Agatha could say anything else, Rio’s phone beeped in her lap. She looked at it, raising an eyebrow and smiled at the screen.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, her forehead furrowed, trying hard not to ask who had managed to make her smile with just a text. Rio unlocked her phone to reply and then turned back to Agatha.</p><p>“Alice asked if I’m with you. I told her to come to your office, is that alright?” </p><p>“I guess. What she wants?”</p><p>“I don’t know, sweetheart. She should be here soon.”</p><p>Hearing her first instinct concerning the arrival of a third person, Agatha stood up from the couch and walked back to her desk, pretending to be busy even though the screen on her laptop was just the background wallpaper.</p><p>Rio wasn’t stupid; she noticed the intentional distance but she didn’t comment on it. She just laid back on the couch, waiting for Alice.</p><p>A few minutes later, Alice knocked on the door and entered when Agatha told her to come inside.</p><p>“Hi, Professor Harkness,” Alice greeted, closing the door behind her. As she took small steps toward Agatha’s desk, her head turned slightly, clearly searching for her best friend— who remained sprawled out on the couch, completely unfazed.</p><p>“Seriously, Alice, are you that desperate to be Agatha’s pupil that you came here five minutes before your meeting?” Rio drawled, her voice dripping with amusement. “Pathetic, really.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes, her cheeks flushing red. But before she could flip Rio off, curse at her, or throw something in her direction, Agatha cut in.</p><p>“Ignore her,” Agatha shot Rio a sharp look— though it did nothing to erase the smirk on her face— before turning her attention back to Alice. "Something wrong?”</p><p>Alice took a deep breath, following the advice to ignore Rio, who was now sitting up on the couch, watching the interaction with clear enjoyment.</p><p>“So, um… we, meaning me and the other students in your research project, had planned to meet up before the meeting itself, but the room you assigned in the email is occupied. Something to do with Professor Kale.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. She was certain the room had been available when she booked it for her meetings with her students, but if there was anyone who could fuck up her plans before they even happened, it was Jen.</p><p>“Are you positive that by the time we meet, the room will still be occupied?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure. That’s why I was looking for you— to see if there's a backup option.”</p><p>Agatha muttered a quiet “shit,” rubbing her forehead as she tried to figure out how to fix the situation in under eight minutes. She was so lost in thought that she didn’t notice when Rio got up and walked over to her, completely ignoring Agatha’s repeated requests of ‘no public displays of affection.’ Rio rounded the desk and gently massaged Agatha's shoulders.</p><p>“Why don’t you use the lab where I work, sweetheart? It should be big enough for you all, and it’s just for today until you figure out something else.”</p><p>“I need a space with proper desks and more room than a lab, Rio— Oh, wait—“ Agatha suddenly paused, grabbing her phone and typing out a few quick texts, too focused to notice the looks Rio and Alice exchanged.</p><p>Her phone buzzed with Lilia’s text, and Agatha let out a relieved sigh.</p><p>“Alice, could you let the other students know we’ll be meeting in the conference room at the administrative building? I’ll send out an email just to make sure while I head over to get everything set up.” Agatha stood up, accidentally brushing against Rio as she did.</p><p>“I’ll take care of it right now.”</p><p>“Wait! I’m coming with you,” Rio said and went to collect her things off the floor and couch.</p><p>Alice stood near the closed door, waiting for Rio as she slung her backpack over her shoulders and slipped her phone into her pocket. Once ready, Rio walked over to Agatha, who was still packing some items into her purse.</p><p>“Don’t forget about our date tonight.” In her defense, Rio said it in a lower tone— not that it made much difference. Alice coincidentally looked away from the two, finding the paintings on the wall very interesting.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t a big fan of the word <em> date </em>, but that’s what it was, wasn’t it? The two of them, alone, in a public place, in an environment perfect for… dates.</p><p>She glanced at Alice, then at Rio, who was batting her brown eyes at her.</p><p>“7 at my house?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head in surprise as Rio leaned in and planted a quick, loud kiss on her lips. She would have been furious, but the moment Rio pulled away, flashing a radiant grin, all her anger melted away in an instant.</p><p>-</p><p>It was 6:48 pm when Agatha descended the stairs and made her way to the kitchen. Pouring herself a generous glass of red wine, she leaned against the counter, phone in hand, scrolling through the unread messages from the past few days.</p><p>The doorbell rang precisely at 7 pm, much to Agatha’s satisfaction. She walked to the door and opened it, only to have the air knocked from her lungs. </p><p> </p>

<p>Rio Vidal stood before her in all her glory, clad in a red cropped blazer featuring a deep plunging neckline and a single-button closure— one Agatha had to resist the urge to touch. She paired it with high-waisted black slacks that, despite covering every inch of skin, wrapped her legs in a way that undoubtedly did justice to both them and her ass.</p><p>Rio looked just as in awe as Agatha.</p><p>Not wanting to wear her usual work attire, Agatha had dared to embrace the autumn chill in a classic little black dress with a sweetheart neckline, long sleeves, and a thigh-high slit.</p><p>“Is that for me?” Agatha asked, her eyes sweeping over Rio’s body one more time before meeting her gaze. Rio was holding a single flower, tilted slightly in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>“Y-yeah,” Rio’s voice came out rough, and she cleared her throat a couple of times. “Fuck, you look hot— You know what? We might as well just stay here. I don’t wanna go out that bad anymore.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and took the flower from Rio’s hand, raising an eyebrow. “You know a bouquet has a bit more flowers than this, right?” she teased.</p><p>“I’m hoping for many,” Rio replied with a smirk, “because the plan is for you to make a bouquet with every flower I give you on each of our dates.”</p><p>Agatha felt like a lovestruck teenager because, for fucks sake, she actually blushed.</p><p>“I’ll put this away and be right back. You can come in if you want,” she said, heading to the kitchen to place the flower in a glass of water. She had no idea if that would actually work, but Rio was the one who knew about plants, not her.</p><p>When she returned, Rio was leaning against the still-open door. Agatha took the opportunity to admire her again, from head to toe, without a shred of shame. At some point, Rio caught on to just how intently she was being watched.</p><p>“See something you like, gorgeous?” Rio smirked, biting down on her own red lip.</p><p>Agatha smiled, reaching out to touch the bare skin between Rio’s breasts. The moment her fingers made contact, goosebumps rose beneath her touch.</p><p>“You look amazing,” Agatha whispered, lowering her head to press a kiss exactly where her fingers had been. Her red lipstick had already dried, leaving no trace behind, much to her disappointment.</p><p>Rio only remembered to breathe again once Agatha pulled away. And as if nothing had happened, Agatha casually grabbed a small black purse with her essentials, ready to head out. Rio, still wearing a dazed, foolish grin, followed her out of the house.</p><p>Inside Rio’s car, Agatha was hit with a wave of vivid flashbacks from the first and last time she had been in that vehicle. Her thighs pressed together a little tighter.</p><p>“How’s your thesis going?” Agatha asked out of nowhere, aiming to break the cloud of sexual tension that had engulfed them since the moment they laid eyes on each other. And to be fair, she still had no real idea what Rio actually studied.</p><p>“I almost have my thesis topic locked in and started drafting my research proposal. The problem is, I had to change advisors— in fact, I already did. Now I just need to sit down with Professor Kale and catch her up on everything I’ve done so far.”</p><p>Agatha pulled a face, her mouth curling in distaste at the mention of Jen’s name. Rio noticed and cackled.</p><p>“What’s your problem with her?”</p><p>“It’s nothing—“ Agatha dismissed quickly. “What’s your thesis focused on?”</p><p>“Forest Dynamics,” Rio answered proudly. “It’s a broad field, which is what I love about it. You can dive into biodiversity, water cycles, wildlife habitats, fire protection— It’s all really fascinating.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even realize she was smiling as she watched Rio speak so passionately about the subject.</p><p>“What do you even do in the lab? Feels like you’re always coming from or going to it.”</p><p>“I’m running some tests to see if I can use a specific species and analyze how it responds, physiologically speaking, to certain external factors. I’m not sure if it’ll work yet, but— ” Rio shot her a grin. “You’re more than welcome to visit. I’d love to show you.”</p><p>“I’ll try to stop by next week between my classes,” Agatha replied, earning a full-toothed grin from Rio.</p><p>The rest of the drive to the bar was filled with music, their conversation drifting in and out. At some point, Rio placed her hand on Agatha’s thigh. Without a word, Agatha simply rested her own hand over it and gave a gentle squeeze.</p><p>The bar had a dim lighting, wooden furniture, and a cozy, rustic decor. The walls were adorned with vintage signs and framed pictures of famous artists from different eras. A mix of candlelit tables, hanging lights, and wall-mounted lamps cast a soft, golden glow over the space.</p><p>As expected for a Friday night, the bar was packed, with only a few empty tables scattered around. Rio had made a reservation, so after giving her name to the hostess, they were quickly led to a table tucked into a cozy corner of the bar.</p><p>“I have to admit, this isn’t what I was expecting,” Agatha said once the hostess left them alone.</p><p>Rio laughed, resting both arms on the table. “What, you thought I was taking you to some dive bar?”</p><p>“Exactly what I was thinking.” </p><p>They both laughed, and soon a waiter came by to take their order. Agatha asked for a whiskey on the rocks, and Rio, a martini.</p><p>“Everything ready for your course next week?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Pretty much, yes. I'm teaching the first two classes, and they're all set— I just need to go over some worksheets."</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, looking surprised. “Worksheets? Already? Damn, you’re really committed to living up to your reputation, huh, sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her blue eyes locked onto Rio’s. She was so caught up in the moment that she only noticed their drinks had arrived when the waiter placed her whiskey in front of her, the movement breaking her line of sight.</p><p>“I don’t know how you hippies handle your classes, but with me, it’s a whole different ballgame,” she taunted, eliciting a giggle from Rio, who shook her head in amusement.</p><p>“Yeah, well, at least I have the privilege of seeing you a lot less tough, borderline begging, I’d say?”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks warm. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she murmured, bringing her whiskey to her lips to hide the smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Rio chuckled again. As Agatha set her glass back down on the table, the sound of her phone vibrating inside her purse filled the space between them. Rio glanced at her, curiosity flickering in her eyes.</p><p>“Let me check if it's Nicky’s dad," Agatha said, reaching into her purse. </p><p>The name ‘Russian Demon’ flashed across the screen. Her expression soured instantly, and without hesitation, she declined the call, switching her phone to silent before tossing it back into her purse.</p><p>“Everything alright?” Rio asked, noticing the shift in Agatha’s demeanor.</p><p>Agatha forced a tight-lipped smile. “Yeah, everything’s fine. Out of curiosity, has Yelena said anything to you?”</p><p>Rio frowned, clearly confused. “You’re gonna have to be a little more specific than that, sweetheart. If this is about her sister, then no, thank God— or else, I’d have to come up with a reason to hate someone I’ve only seen once.”</p><p>“No, not that. About you— you two.”</p><p>“What? You’re losing me here.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, downing almost all of her whiskey in one go, feeling the familiar burn slide down her throat.</p><p>“I ran into her yesterday, and apparently she’s highly interested in you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression shifted from confusion to pure amusement, her lips curling into a smug, almost wicked grin. “What, are you worried I’m gonna start flirting with your ex’s sister? That would be one hell of a Mexican soap opera, huh?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh along with Rio.</p><p>“Hey, she didn’t say anything, and relax— even if she did, there are plenty of other women for her at the university. I’m already taken.” Rio winked at Agatha, and despite her best efforts, she couldn't stop herself from smiling.</p><p>Agatha waved to the waiter, signaling for another round of drinks for them.</p><p>“I’m going to miss you next week. I was getting really used to sleeping with you.” Rio lamented, reaching out to place her hand on top of Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha turned her palm up, her fingers tracing along the side of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“You’ll still see me during the classes, baby. And I could try to set up a sleepover for Nicky at Wanda’s place sometime, even though it’s a school night. The kids love it.”</p><p>Rio smiled, but before she could say anything else, the atmosphere of the bar shifted as a louder, more upbeat song started playing through the speakers. Both women turned their heads, realizing at the same time that the new sound was coming from another corner of the bar, further away, where a woman was singing into a microphone.</p><p>The drinks were set on the table, and Agatha immediately reached for her whiskey.</p><p>“I didn’t know they had live music here too! You’re so going to dance with me.”</p><p>“Oh no, I’m not,” Agatha shot back. </p><p>Rio pouted, trailing her fingertips along Agatha’s arm. “How drunk do I have to get you to say yes?”</p><p>“A lot more, that’s for sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, Rio had successfully gotten Agatha to the level of intoxication she wanted. The good, or bad, thing was that she hadn't done it without throwing her own sobriety out the window.</p><p>They were laughing over a story Agatha was telling about a student from years ago who hadn’t turned in an assignment. According to him, the grief from losing his grandmother had taken a huge toll on his mental state, leaving him unable to focus on his studies.</p><p>Back in her early years of teaching, Agatha had believed him and granted him an extra week to complete the work. Seven days later, he seemed noticeably better— like he had come to terms with the loss of his dear grandmother. Something about it felt off, though, so Agatha decided to dig a little deeper into his tragic story about the dead lady.</p><p>Turns out, the student had lost his grandmother— two years prior.</p><p>Agatha was so outraged that she failed him and made his life hell the second time he took her class. Nowadays, unless the student was the one who had died, she didn’t cut anyone slack. Ever.</p><p>Rio laughed so hard that Agatha couldn’t help but join in.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m hearing about Professor Harkness’ breaking point for The Witch.”</p><p>“The nickname existed before. I just made sure it stuck.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, shaking her head as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing: Agatha, completely at ease. Her hair was no longer perfectly in place from the countless times she had run her fingers through it, and her lipstick had faded to a lighter shade from all the whiskey glasses she had pressed her lips against.</p><p>The bar was more crowded than ever, with people now dancing in front of the little stage where the same woman was still singing. Rio finished her drink and stood up, smoothing her hands over her lap to straighten her clothes. She extended her hand toward Agatha.</p><p>“Let’s sweat out some of this alcohol, sweetheart. I’d rather not be holding anyone’s hair tonight.”</p><p>Agatha stood as well, but instead of taking Rio’s hand, she grabbed her wrist and pulled her in close. Their cheeks brushed as Agatha leaned in to whisper, “That’s a shame— I was counting on having my hair in your fists a lot tonight.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk faltered as she bit down hard on her own lip. “Just because I didn’t take you to a dive bar doesn’t mean I can’t have my way with you in the restroom here, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha was undoubtedly appreciating Rio's pet names for her. But the way Rio pronounced her actual name stirred something deep inside her, making her knees unstable.</p><p>Agatha ran the tip of her tongue along Rio’s earlobe and whispered, “Do I look like the kind of woman who spreads her legs in a bar restroom? Please, Rio.”</p><p>She absolutely would if Rio asked her right then and there, but she liked to believe she had more self-respect than that. Pulling back, Agatha caught the way Rio’s pupils had blown wide, her lower lip trapped between her teeth. Before Rio could make some cocky remark, Agatha took her hand and led her straight into the crowd.</p><p>
<strong> </strong>
</p><p>After a few songs— Agatha couldn’t tell if it had been five or fifteen— the heat started rising from her chest to her cheeks. Whether it was from the obscene amount of whiskey or the fact that Rio’s hands were gripping her waist, pressing the front of her body against Agatha’s ass, was hard to say.</p><p>Agatha just needed to breathe. Or drink a gallon of water. Or spread her legs for Rio in the damn restroom. She turned to face Rio, who had flushed cheeks and a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead. Agatha probably didn’t look much different.</p><p>Leaning in close, knowing there was no other way to be heard over the music, she spoke directly into Rio’s ear. “I need some air. I’m stepping outside for a bit, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, quickly grabbing Agatha’s hand as they made their way outside together.</p><p>They stood side by side by the entrance of the bar, the cold breeze a welcome contrast to the warmth of their skin. Rio opened her purse and pulled out what appeared to be a cigarette, using one hand to shield the flame against the wind as she lit it with the other. </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow in surprise; she had never seen Rio smoke, nor had she ever caught the smell of tobacco on her. On the spot, she realized why— it was a joint.</p><p>Rio took three quick puffs to light it, and once it was burning, she offered it to Agatha.</p><p>It had been years since she’d smoked, and what better moment than this? With the alcohol loosening her up, Agatha took the joint and inhaled, filling her lungs. They protested the foreign sensation and immediately retaliated with a series of coughs.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered, handing the joint back to Rio, who took it and began gently patting her back.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you some water?” Rio offered.</p><p>“No, no— here, hold my purse, I’ll go get it. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha handed it to Rio and made her way back to the bar, the music immediately filling her ears. She walked up to the counter, and after several attempts to catch the bartender’s attention, she finally ordered a bottle of water. A few minutes later, with the water in hand, she returned to Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t even finished opening the bottle when Rio turned to her, blowing the smoke into her face.</p><p>“Why is Putin calling you?”</p><p>Agatha must have misunderstood. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A contact named Russian Demon in your phone. I can’t imagine who else it could be.” Rio spoke sharply, smoking the joint.</p><p>Agatha froze, the bottle halfway to her lips, looking skeptically at Rio.</p><p>“You went through my phone?”</p><p>“No! Your purse was open, and your phone kept lighting up. I didn’t mean to look, I did it without thinking," Rio replied, her words coming out at an unusually fast pace. "Why do you have eleven missed calls from her, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, unsure whether to believe a single word coming out of Rio’s mouth. If it were anyone else, she wouldn’t. But because it was Rio, she only took a deep breath.</p><p>“I have no fucking clue why she’s been calling me.” She snapped, practically spitting out the words before bringing the bottle to her lips.</p><p>“Have you been meeting her?” Rio pressed.</p><p>Agatha drank half the bottle before answering. “You know I haven’t.”</p><p>“Then why the fuck she’s calling you? How does she even have your number?” </p><p>“I don’t know, Rio. Maybe she got it from Carol, and they’re plotting against you,” Agatha replied sarcastically, rolling her eyes, only managing to make the situation significantly worse.</p><p>Rio crushed the joint forcefully against the wall, crumbling the tip before shoving it into her bag. Without another word, she turned on her heel and walked back into the bar, leaving Agatha standing alone.</p><p>How Agatha went from being horny out of her mind to seriously considering calling an Uber and going home alone within minutes was beyond what her alcohol-clouded brain could comprehend.</p><p>As irony always seemed to find her, a sudden glow from inside her purse caught her attention in the darkness of the sidewalk. She yanked her phone out forcefully, pressing her finger against the screen to accept the call as she brought it to her ear, snapping,“What?”</p><p>Surprised by the fact that the call had finally been answered, Natasha's voice came through the line a few seconds later.</p><p>“Fucking finally. It didn’t used to be this hard to get a hold of you before.”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“Talk to you. See you. Where are you? I can meet you right now, just send me the address.”</p><p>“How the hell have you not understood there is nothing to talk about? Fuck, Natasha, there’s no way you’re this fucking lonely that you’re blowing up my phone this late.”</p><p>“Are you going to meet me, or will I have to figure out your address the same way I got your number and office, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha briefly considered throwing her phone against the same wall that still had traces of Rio’s crushed joint. She started pacing up and down the sidewalk, still with no sign of Rio.</p><p>“Do that, and I’ll call the cops. Or better yet, I might finally take some advice and beat the fuck out of you.”</p><p>“Oh hon, don’t promise me a good time like that—“</p><p>Agatha hung up before Natasha could finish her sentence.</p><p>She groaned in frustration and headed back into the bar, searching for Rio. With the place packed— tables full, people standing around, talking, dancing— Agatha weaved through the crowd like a madwoman, circling the bar twice without any sign of Rio. She thought she heard someone call her name, but her brain was probably playing tricks on her because Rio was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The only place she hadn't checked was the restroom, where a long line of women stood waiting by the door. Standing outside the line, Agatha crossed her arms and decided to wait, watching for anyone coming out to make sure Rio wasn’t inside.</p><p>Sure enough, a few minutes later, Rio stepped out.</p><p>“Let’s talk,” Agatha said, and Rio hesitated. “Right now, Rio.” Agatha took her hand. Rio let herself be led to a quieter corner of the bar, away from the crowd and the pounding music.</p><p>“You have no right to question me. Not like that, not in a place like this. I’ve been honest with you about my situation with Natasha, and if you think I’m hiding something, you better say it now.”</p><p>Facing each other, standing close enough to hear over the background noise, Rio leaned against the wall and crossed her arms, still silent.</p><p>Agatha went on. “You have a serious trust issue, or jealousy, or both— I don't know, but I'm getting tired of it. I’d rather not keep explaining myself to you every single time you feel jealous, which, to be honest, happens way more often than it should.”</p><p>“I’m not like this, not normally. I don’t know why I get this jealous when it comes to you,” Rio sighed, “I'm sorry if I thought we had finally gotten past the drama with that blonde asshole, and now your ex shows up. Seriously, Agatha, it feels like I’m just waiting for someone to swoop in and steal you away."</p><p>“The drama exists because you create it. I’m not going to take responsibility for unanswered calls, inappropriate flirting, none of it. I won’t be held accountable for other people’s actions and yet all you do is let their actions dictate everything.”</p><p>Rio poked her tongue against the inside of her cheek, looking away from Agatha’s intense stare.</p><p>Agatha waited patiently for a response. One minute. Two. Three. Still nothing from the younger woman. She was starting to grow impatient, and the constant bumping from people squeezing through the packed bar wasn’t helping.</p><p>“Am I calling an Uber home, Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice seemed to pull Rio out of a trance, making her blink a few times, as if surprised by the question. Uncrossing her arms, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“No— I don’t want this to ruin our night, I really don’t,” Rio sighed, tilting her head back toward the ceiling for a moment before locking eyes with Agatha again. “I’ll go grab some beers for us, don’t move.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized how anxious she was until Rio’s response. Her shoulders relaxed, and she shook her head, watching as Rio disappeared into the crowd. Just to be sure, she checked her phone again and sighed in relief— no new calls from Natasha.</p><p>Rio returned with two beer bottles, handing one to Agatha. They took a few sips in silence, and unsure of exactly where they stood at that moment, Agatha waited for Rio to take the lead in the conversation.</p><p>“What are you doing this weekend?" Rio asked, clearly making an effort to steer the conversation toward something lighter.</p><p>“Finishing up some work, but I'll do that at home. And on Sunday, Nicky’s coming over. What about you? Want to stay over tomorrow?” </p><p>Agatha would never admit it, but after three nights sleeping next to Rio, once she got past the initial anxiety, she found comfort in it. And that comfort was starting to carve out a space in her heart. The rest of the week, when she slept alone, she found herself lying on the same pillow Rio had used, still carrying traces of her smell.</p><p>Rio smiled at the invitation, her expression more at ease. “Yeah, I just need to stop by my place to get a few things, but I’ll do that in the morning.”</p><p>“In the morning?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Fine, after lunch. Whatever.” Rio playfully rolled her eyes, using her free hand to pull Agatha closer. Agatha placed her palm against the wall behind Rio, pressing her body against hers.</p><p>“Are we okay?” Agatha wanted to be sure. Rio murmured a soft "yeah" against her lips before closing the distance.</p><p>Agatha silently sought permission to deepen the kiss, running the tip of her tongue along Rio’s lower lip, and Rio let her. </p><p>Even though Agatha wasn’t one for public displays of affection, the bar was packed, the lights were low, and she had been drinking. Hell, she had even smoked— just one hit, but still.</p><p>Their tongues grew more frantic against each other, and every time Agatha tried to pull away for air, Rio chased her lips, biting and tugging until Agatha surrendered to the kiss again.</p><p>They still held their beer bottles, long forgotten, and that was the only thing keeping them from turning this into outright public indecency. Even though Agatha was a lawyer, that was one charge she had no intention of dealing with.</p><p>She tried to pull away once more, and this time, Rio let her, probably because she needed oxygen just as much.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here, fuck,” Rio breathed, “I need you, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She didn’t trust her words when she could feel her panties getting drenched. Instead, she just shook her head and took Rio’s hand, leading them toward the bar counter.</p><p>At the counter, they spent a few moments impishly arguing over who would cover the bill, until Rio finally agreed that Agatha would pay this time and she’d cover the next.</p><p>Outside, a very obvious realization hit Agatha— one she somehow hadn’t processed until now. They had driven here. And they had been drinking. </p><p>She came to an abrupt stop, and Rio turned to her, tilting her head in confusion.</p><p>“Did you forget something inside?” Rio asked, spinning the keyring in her fingers.</p><p>“You’re driving?”</p><p>“Yeah? Or you’re actually a witch and planning to give me a ride on your broomstick?” Rio quipped, laughing at her own joke, which only made Agatha more alarmed about how drunk she actually was.</p><p>“Ha ha, funny,” Agatha said sarcastically. “I’m not getting in that car with you. My kid is way too young for me to risk leaving him without a mother.”</p><p>“You’re overreacting, Agatha. I’m fine. See?” Rio stretched out her arm and, with her index finger extended, attempted to touch the tip of her nose several times. It didn’t help that she missed the first two tries.</p><p>“Yeah, not happening. We’re getting an Uber.” Agatha stated firmly, leaving no room for argument. Rio just sighed, slipping the keys back into her pocket before returning to Agatha’s side.</p><p>Agatha pulled out her phone to order an Uber through the app. It was set to arrive in thirteen minutes.</p><p>“I’m just gonna grab my bag from the car.”</p><p>“Okay baby, don’t take too long.” Agatha warned, watching as Rio walked off toward her car.</p><p>Agatha leaned her shoulder against the wall, grimacing as the icy wind bit at her bare legs. She was scrolling through her phone when she heard her name being called. Lifting her head, she instinctively turned toward the voice, somehow expecting it to be Rio.</p><p>if she had been paying attention, she would’ve played dumb. Or pretended to faint. Anything would have been better than what her eyes landed on— Jennifer Kale, one eyebrow raised and a surprised smile playing on her lips as she walked toward her.</p><p>“You? Here? This doesn’t seem like your kind of place," Jen remarked once she was close enough. She was accompanied by a group of unknown women who lingered by the bar entrance.</p><p>Agtha’s heart pounded at the sight of Kale standing in front of her, and she snapped back, “Well, the coven canceled the bonfire dance tonight, so what else was I supposed to do?” She lifted her shoulders in a half-shrug, arms slightly raised, palms open and facing upward.</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “I thought I saw you inside. I even called you, but you didn’t turn around, and then I lost sight of you. Did you ignore me on purpose?”</p><p>Fuck, she <em> had </em> heard someone calling her.</p><p>“I didn’t hear you. Anyway, I’m actually leaving right now, so you can go ba—“</p><p>“Sweetheart, can we order something to eat at your house? I’m starving,” Rio said, completely unaware of the third presence. And to make things worse, she said it while slipping an arm around Agatha’s waist. Agatha froze.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio was the first to break the silence.</p><p>Silence she only noticed because Agatha hadn’t said a word, then she turned her head and finally saw Jennifer Kale, staring at them in pure shock.</p><p>“Wait,” Jen lifted a finger, pointing between the two of them. “Did I make this happen? Was I a matchmaker for Agatha Harkness? Now <em> that’s </em> a plot twist I definitely didn’t see coming.” She let out a breath, still wide-eyed as she looked between them.</p><p>At that point, Agatha had nothing left to deny, no way to deflect, no excuse to pretend it was all some big misunderstanding. She took a deep breath— just as her phone buzzed, notifying her that the car would be arriving soon. At least there was an escape from this shitstorm of a situation.</p><p>“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to Lilia—“</p><p>“Agatha—“</p><p>“I’ll tell her. If I think it’s necessary and when I decide to do it. I hope you can respect that, Jen,” Agatha murmured. “The car’s here. Let’s go, Rio.”</p><p>A few awkward goodbyes were exchanged, the three of them still equally stunned, and Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand, leading her toward the waiting Uber.</p><p>The ride to Agatha's house was mostly quiet, primarily because Agatha didn’t want to discuss anything that had just happened in front of a stranger. Rio was content just holding her hand during the drive, gently tracing the length of her fingers and the back of her hand.</p><p>Once inside Agatha’s house, she placed her things on the table and sighed, stretching her neck from side to side.</p><p>“For what it's worth, she seemed more shocked that she kinda introduced us than anything else,” Rio said in a playful tone, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, partially regretting not having drunk more. "I’m going upstairs to shower. Feel free to order some food.”</p><p> </p><p>After finishing her shower and her nightly skincare routine, which involved different moisturizers for various parts of her body, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, her hair pulled up in a messy bun, a few wet strands framing her face.</p><p>Rio was sitting on her bed, leaning against the headboard, the blanket pulled up to her waist. She had changed into a white, thin tank top. </p><p>Agatha was heading toward her closet when Rio called her.</p><p>“You won’t be needing clothes, sweetheart.” </p><p>Agatha let out a laugh, already turning to Rio, ready to fire back with a witty remark, until she caught the look in Rio’s eyes. That hungry expression stole the words right from her lips. </p><p>Rio was watching her like a predator stalking its prey, and fuck if Agatha didn’t feel heat rush straight to her face.</p><p>“Weren’t you hungry?” Agatha asked, though she had already turned back, slowly making her way toward the bed where Rio remained in the same position.</p><p>“I still am,” Rio replied, her voice lower, “but for something else.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, fingers teasing the edge of the towel as she took slow, deliberate steps, putting on a show as the fabric loosened, slipping inch by inch. “We still need to talk about everything that happened today.”</p><p>“I know. And we will. Tomorrow.” Rio murmured, eyes locked on Agatha. “Right now, I want to fuck you with my cock until you can’t take it anymore, and beg me to let you breathe,” Rio pulled the blanket off her lap, revealing the same strap she had used at her house, now positioned between her legs. “I wanna sleep covered in your cum tonight.”</p><p>If that was a promise, Agatha would make sure to hold her accountable.</p><p>She discarded the towel with far less finesse than she had started with and climbed onto the bed, straddling Rio. Without hesitation, Rio’s hands found her thighs, fingers digging into Agatha’s pale skin.</p><p>“You smell so good, Agatha, god,” Rio said, thrusting her hips upward and making the strap rub against Agatha’s center, who opened her mouth in a silent moan. </p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s face, a finger resting on each cheek as she leaned down. She moved in so close that Rio was sure she was about to kiss her, and instinctively, she closed her eyes, tilting forward. </p><p>But Agatha held her in place with the slightest pressure of her fingers. Then, instead of kissing her, she traced the tip of her tongue slowly over Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Before you fuck me with your cock, pretty boy, let’s see if you’re this chatty with my pussy in your face,” Agatha whispered, sucking on her lower lip before positioning herself until she was sitting on Rio’s beautiful face.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On Saturday morning, Agatha sat at the dining table in front of her laptop, a cup of coffee beside her along with her planner. After much effort earlier in the morning, she had managed to untangle herself from Rio, who was still upstairs, sleeping like the dead.</p><p>She had been reviewing the first three classes of her upcoming course for over two hours, and after finishing the remaining worksheets, she considered at least checking whether Rio was still breathing.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, she glanced up at the steps and gave up on the idea. Her entire body ached. If she had known that sleeping with a woman so much younger for hours would work out so many muscles at once, she would have gone after Rio Vidal a long time ago. Fuck gym and running.</p><p>Agatha decided to head to the kitchen instead. She pulled a few pans from the cabinet and grabbed eggs, fresh herbs, and butter from the fridge. Her stomach growled— she had already gone to bed hungry, so to say she was starving would be an understatement.</p><p>With one bowl of seasoned eggs and another with pancake batter, Agatha hummed a random song, facing the stove, when a pair of arms wrapped around her from behind. She jumped slightly, startled, and turned her head just as Rio rested her chin on her shoulder.</p><p>“Morning, gorgeous.” Rio murmured, her fingertips moving over Agatha's flowered robe drawing lines across her stomach.</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha replied, turning her head to look at her. Rio's hair was damp, and she carried the scent of Agatha's conditioner mixed with her own body lotion. “You smell nice.” </p><p>Rio smiled and pressed a kiss to Agatha's covered shoulder.</p><p>“Need help?” Rio offered, eyeing the two pans Agatha was handling— one with scrambled eggs, the other with pancakes.</p><p>“If you want to help, sure. You can put the bread in the toaster and start the coffee machine.”</p><p>A few minutes passed in comfortable silence as the two moved in sync around the kitchen. With the toaster running, Rio opened the coffee machine’s filter compartment and turned to Agatha. </p><p>“This is still warm. How many cups have you had already?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Two or three.”</p><p>“You have an addiction, you’re aware of that, right?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and kept cooking, making sure not to let anything burn.</p><p> </p><p>Once everything was ready and set on the dining table, Agatha took a seat at the head while Rio sat beside her.</p><p>“Thank you for this, you didn’t have to.” Rio said, taking a bite of her toast.</p><p>“I kind of did, since I was starving and I had no hope you’d be up before noon.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, “Fair point.”</p><p>They ate in comfortable silence until Rio was done with her toast and got up to head back to the kitchen. After a few moments, she called out, “Do you happen to have syrup?”</p><p>“Yeah, top cabinet, second shelf,” Agatha replied, helping herself to more eggs.</p><p>Rio returned with the syrup bottle in hand and plopped back into her chair.</p><p>“Why the hell do you keep this so high up?” Rio asked, piling three pancakes onto her plate.</p><p>“Nicky has an unhealthy obsession with this. If I leave it within his reach, I end up buying a new bottle every two days. Now I just keep it on the top shelf and switch spots whenever he figures out where I’ve hidden it.” </p><p>“I think I’ll suggest this same idea to Nicky when it comes to your coffee," Rio teased, earning a laugh from Agatha.</p><p>“I doubt either you or Nicky would want to deal with me without my caffeine dose, believe me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t reply. She just smiled with her mouth full.</p><p>Agatha’s phone was still on the table, just a few inches from Rio’s plate, when it started ringing. Instinctively, both of them glanced at the glowing screen, where the name Paul appeared. </p><p>Agatha let out a relieved sigh, but the tension from the night before crept back in. From the corner of her eye, she noticed Rio watching her as she answered the call.</p><p>“Yes?” </p><p>“Mom?” Nicky’s voice came through the line, making Agatha furrow her brows. It wasn’t unusual for her son to call using his dad’s phone, but it typically happened during the week, when a few days apart started to feel too long for him. With only one day left until he was back home with her, she found it odd.</p><p>“Hey, sweetie. Everything okay?” Her voice softened instantly, slipping into the warm, affectionate tone she reserved just for him.</p><p>“Um, yeah, I just miss you.” </p><p>A tender smile formed on Agatha’s lips as she ignored Rio’s concerned glances in her direction.</p><p>“Oh, honey, I miss you too. Are you doing anything fun with your dad today?”</p><p>“He said if it doesn’t rain, we’ll go to the park… but I doubt she will let us.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced, immediately understanding that the <em> she </em> in question referred to Paul’s wife.</p><p>“If it rains, I promise I’ll take you during the week, okay?”</p><p>Instead of the excitement Agatha expected— especially since sports were something she always left to Paul— Nicky’s response was unusually flat. “Yeah,” he dragged out the vowels, “I gotta go. Love you, mom.”</p><p>“Love you too, sweetie.” The call ended, and Agatha sighed, lifting her gaze to meet Rio’s, who was still watching her with quiet concern.</p><p>“Something is going on at Paul’s house, and Nicky doesn’t want to tell me. He’s probably afraid we’ll argue. I hate how he feels the need to defend his father to me.” Agatha vented, resting her elbow on the table and propping her head up with her index finger.</p><p>“I’m sure he will tell you eventually.” Rio offered sympathetically, placing her hand over Agatha’s on the table and giving it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Agatha debated calling Paul to demand a reason for their son's reluctance to stay at his house or why he sounded so blue when he contacted her.</p><p>However, doing that would mean either leaving Rio alone for hours or sending her home, since there was a good chance she’d end up bringing Nicky back with her. And despite things being good between them that morning, a single call on Agatha’s phone had been enough to shift the mood between them in a matter of seconds.</p><p>She clasped her hands together and stood up from the table. “Let’s move this to the couch,” she said, tilting her head toward the living room. Rio followed her and the two sat on the couch, respecting each other's space but still close with their knees touching.</p><p>“I think we should talk about last night,” Agatha began, noticing the way Rio seemed to sink into the cushions.</p><p>“We can, but I don’t know what to say.”</p><p>“Fine. I’ll start: like I said last night, I don’t want— actually, I <em> won’t </em> tolerate you cornering me in completely inappropriate places just because you’re having a jealous fit.”</p><p>“Hold on— it’s not fair for you to talk like I’m some kind of lunatic. I had every right to be bothered that your ex is chasing after you. Relentlessly, I might add.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed the tip of her nose, knowing her next words were bound to hit hard. “Okay, I’m just going to say this now and get it over with… I’m going to meet her.”</p><p>Rio sat up straighter than Agatha had ever seen her, her posture rigid. “What? Are you serious?”</p><p>“Yes. That’s what she wants, and I’d rather do this than have her harassing my phone, my workplace, or, god forbid, my home. This way, I hear whatever she has to say, tell her to go fuck herself, and that’s the end of it.”</p><p>“Okay, so she keeps calling because she wants to see you, and you’re just going to give her exactly what she wants? Wouldn’t it be easier to just block her number?” Rio asked, visibly irritated.</p><p>“And what good would that do if she knows where I work? She even knows where my office is, Rio. To be honest, I’d rather meet her somewhere than have her show up on campus or, even worse, here— with my son home.” Agatha explained, voicing the same internal debate she’d had after Natasha’s call, when she had literally threatened to get her home address.</p><p>Rio remained silent, thoughtful. Considering this was the first time since Natasha that Agatha had made an effort to explain herself, or rather, to truly communicate with someone, she wasn’t sure what else to say. She simply sighed and waited. Eventually, Rio would speak.</p><p>And she did. After a few minutes of heavy silence, Rio finally said, “I don’t like this situation. It makes me uncomfortable, jealous, and frustrated. And I think it’s because… I need more from you.”</p><p>Agatha was stunned. She had expected anger, jealousy, accusations— anything but this.</p><p>“More?” She asked, and Rio nodded. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“I don’t want to be treated like a fuck buddy.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Do I treat you like that? You sleep here all the time. Do you really think—“</p><p>Rio cut her off. “Agatha, I mean I want more. This. <em> Us </em>.” She gestured between them. “You don’t have to announce it to the entire university, but not treating me like a stranger would be a good start. Last night was the first time you invited me to stay over, and I’m pretty sure you only did it because we had a fight. I don’t want to be the one who always invites, always asks. I don’t want to feel like I’m the only one who cares, and to you, it’s just… whatever.”</p><p>Agatha’s nose would soon be raw if she didn’t stop scratching it with her index finger— a clear habit whenever she was stressed. She repeated the motion, pressing her lips together as Rio’s words settled in.</p><p>“I don’t know what more I can offer you beyond what I already do, Rio. I can’t treat you differently at the university, not with the course starting and you being my student. I can’t ask you to stay over when Nicky is here, for obvious reasons. So I really don’t know what else you’re asking for.”</p><p>“And I get all of that, I really do, Agatha,” Rio said, placing a hand on her knee. “I’m just asking for it not to be one-sided. And I don’t want our time together to only happen when I come over to your place.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but Rio was faster. “Agatha, Alice knows about us. It’s not the end of the world if she sees you at our apartment. Besides, she’s always busy— she’s barely ever there. I know being here is easier, but sometimes, I wanna stay home with you.”</p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth several times, the words struggling to come out. Consciously, she knew Rio was right about much of what she said, even though she didn’t agree with the idea of Alice seeing her in any environment outside of academic settings. However, considering the many other situations Agatha had put Rio through, as pointed out by the student, Agatha knew that occasionally dealing with her roommate wasn’t the worst thing that could happen. Just another anxiety she’d have to figure out how to manage.</p><p>She stretched her lips into a smile that wasn’t too obviously forced. “Yes. Okay. I can do that. Mostly.” Her words came out slowly, and she avoided looking at Rio to focus on giving a decent response. “I’ll make concessions for you, but you need to stop with the jealousy, Rio, for fucks sake. I mean it.” </p><p>Rio smiled and leaned toward Agatha, kneeling on the cushion to plant kisses on her face. Agatha kept smiling the whole time, until she captured Rio’s lips during one of their moments when her lips came close to hers.</p><p>“Okay, what about Jennifer fucking Kale?” Agatha asked, making Rio huff in response. Instead of sitting back in her previous spot, Rio moved closer, draping her legs over Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“I can talk to her. She’s my advisor now, so we’ll be working closely throughout my program… I don’t want this to turn into something awkward between us.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands instinctively dropped to Rio’s legs, absentmindedly tracing soft circles on her covered skin. She sighed, not entirely on board with Rio’s plan to talk to Jen. What would she even say? Ask her to keep it quiet?<br/>That would just make Agatha look like the coward who sent the student to do her dirty work.</p><p>“I don’t know if I like the idea of you talking to her, Rio. And besides, talk to her about what, exactly? Just— If she brings something up about me or about us, ignore her and let me handle it.”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m not going to ignore my advisor, and I sure as hell am not switching again. That would set me back way too much.”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to, just… don’t say anything. I don’t think Jen is the type to go around gossiping anyway. This is just a precaution.” She didn’t know if Jen was that kind of person or not— all she had was a whole lot of hope. That was it.</p><p>“Okay, sweetheart,” Rio scooted forward, now fully straddling Agatha’s lap, her legs wrapped snugly around her waist. “With Kale, Maximoff, and Alice knowing about us, we might as well throw a party.” She teased, sliding her hands around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Right. And to really top it off, all that’s left is a full-on make-out session in my classrooms with my students watching.” She shot back dryly, attempting to cross her arms. Rio didn’t let her. Instead, she grabbed Agatha’s wrists and pulled her into an embrace, wrapping Agatha’s arms around her own waist.</p><p>“I’d quite love to show them who actually gets to kiss you,” Rio murmured, tilting her head to press a kiss to the corner of Agatha’s lips, then another just behind her ear, trailing down to her neck. “To touch you,” she whispered, her right hand gliding down to the sensitive spot just beneath Agatha’s breast, sending a shiver straight through her. “To have you, all to myself.” Rio’s lips found the pulse point on Agatha’s neck, sucking just hard enough to make her hiss at the sensation.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio— “ Agatha exhaled, not particularly proud of how quickly she had turned into a needy mess even before Rio had finished speaking. “You’re insane for even thinking that,” she murmured, voice low, “and I must be even crazier for getting wet just from hearing it.”</p><p>When Rio pulled back, her rich brown eyes locked onto Agatha’s striking blue ones, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips. “We have the whole day, sweetheart, and I promise I'll take care of all your needs.” Rio pressed a quick kiss to her lips before adding, “But first… Why don’t you go change while I clean up, and then we can go get my car, and stop by my apartment to grab a few things?”</p><p>Agatha must have scowled at the idea, because Rio, still hovering over her, gave her lip a playful bite. “Hey, no making that face. You promised.”</p><p>“I didn’t promise, per se—“</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Fine, fine.” She murmured, giving Rio one last quick kiss before getting up.</p><p>After a quick shower, Agatha put on a pair of jeans— something that was extremely rare, mind you— and a sweater. She hadn’t washed her hair, so it was still wild around her face and down her back, thanks to Rio’s relentless hands from the night before. She gave up on trying to tame her wild locks and applied light makeup before heading back downstairs.</p><p>Rio had already cleared the dining table and was in the kitchen loading the dishwasher. </p><p>She turned around as Agatha walked in and let out a low whistle, eyeing her clothes. “I like this outfit. More Agatha less the Witch.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and went to her. After a heated make-out session pressed against the kitchen counter, they called an Uber.</p><p>-</p><p>“Fuck I’m cold.” Rio complained as they entered her apartment. She was wearing the same clothes from the night before, which wasn’t exactly weather-appropriate, considering the chilly wind outside.</p><p>“You should’ve grabbed one of my jackets when we left, baby. It’s really cold today.” Agatha said, placing her bag and phone on the kitchen counter.</p><p>“Yeah yeah, your house is warm— I didn’t think I’d risk freezing my ass off.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Go get your stuff while I make some tea. Where do you keep it?”</p><p>“Somewhere that could be the cupboard, the fridge, or the oven. Seriously, no idea.”</p><p>“You live here, right?” Agatha teased, walking around the counter to fill the kettle with water.</p><p>Instead of heading to her room, Rio stayed watching Agatha in the kitchen. When Agatha turned toward her, raising an eyebrow silently asking why she was stalling, Rio walked over to her and wrapped her arms around her. </p><p>“I like seeing you here.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and wrapped her arms around Rio's neck. As she was about to lean in for a kiss, Alice appeared in the hallway that led to the kitchen.</p><p>“I thought I heard voices. Thank god I'm not imagining things," Alice said, walking into the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha tensed but didn't move, trying to keep her word to Rio.</p><p>“Not yet, anyway.” Rio replied, still clinging to Agatha.</p><p>Alice let out a laugh. “I thought you'd be back on Sunday...”</p><p>“Yeah, we just came here to grab a few things." Rio kissed Agatha's cheek and released her to head to her room.</p><p>Both alone in the kitchen, Agatha murmured a soft "Hi" and started looking for the tea.</p><p>“Do you mind if I call you Agatha outside of campus? It's weird calling you Professor Harkness at home," Alice said, leaning her elbows on the counter.</p><p>Gone was Agatha's hope that Alice would go back to her room.</p><p>“No, not at all.” Agatha lied, her back turned to Alice. Unfortunately, she found a tea box in the first cupboard she opened. She turned back to the counter, maintaining her distance from Alice.</p><p>“Where do you keep the mugs?”</p><p>“I’ll get them for you.” Alice offered, walking over to one of the cabinets, grabbing two mugs, and placing them in front of Agatha before returning to her previous spot.</p><p>“Is this too weird for you?” Alice asked teasingly, but her look was far from amusing.  </p><p>“A little bit, yes.” Agatha confessed.</p><p>“Don’t worry, not on my account. Rio really likes you, and both of you can feel comfortable here. I won't be a cockblock.” Alice joked, and Agatha wanted nothing more than to sink into the floor. Lacking the tools— or an excavator— to do so, she pressed her lips together and silently prayed for Rio to hurry back.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer her silent plea quickly enough, and with nothing else to say, Agatha changed the subject. “Do you want some tea too?”</p><p>Alice shook her head. “No, thanks.”</p><p>The silence grew awkward until Alice finally spoke up, “I’m going back to my studies. I’ll see you on campus, Agatha.”</p><p>“Uh-huh, see you there.” Agatha quickly replied, letting out a relieved sigh when Alice left her alone in the kitchen.</p><p>The kettle clicked off and she poured the hot water into the two mugs, waiting for Rio.</p><p>-</p><p>A few hours later, back at her house, Agatha was lying with her back against a pillow on the arm of the couch, a book on forensic and legal psychology resting in her lap. It was one she had started reading during her vacation but had completely forgotten about in the midst of her busy days. Since she planned to recommend it to her students by the end of the academic year, she needed to finish it first.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, was stationed at the dining table, surrounded by her laptop, books, printed articles, and a chaotic mess of highlighted and scribbled-on papers. Every thirty minutes, she would drag herself into the living room, wait for Agatha to glance up at her, complain about how exhausted she was, receive a sympathetic smile in return, and then go right back to work. This had already happened four times.</p><p>On the fifth, Agatha closed the book in her lap and gestured for Rio to go to her.</p><p>“I can’t. I have to go back to my reading.”</p><p>“I highly doubt you’re getting much reading done if you keep coming over here just to give me those puppy eyes," Agatha remarked, raising an eyebrow at her.</p><p>“I'm hungry, that's why I can't concentrate.” Rio said, walking over to Agatha, who pulled her legs in to make space for her.</p><p>“Home-cooked meal or pizza?”</p><p>Still standing, Rio gave Agatha the most pitiful look she could muster. “McDonald’s.”</p><p>“Aren’t you a vegetarian?” </p><p>“I want their fries and a strawberry shake.”</p><p>“I honestly don’t know if I’m supposed to take you seriously."</p><p>Rio sat next to Agatha, grasping her hands with a smile that accentuated the stupid little gap between her teeth.</p><p>“Please, I'm tired of sitting on my ass, reading, and trying to come up with something that just isn’t happening. Come on, Agatha, I know there's a McDonald's nearby.”</p><p>Knowing that the chances of Rio giving up on the idea were close to zero, Agatha figured it was best to just give in and get it over with. Either way, the outcome would be the same. At least this way, she could return to the comfort of her couch and her book a little sooner.</p><p>“Fine, but you’re driving.”</p><p>-</p><p>With the car parked in the McDonald's lot, Rio turned off the ignition and shifted to face Agatha, eyes filled with expectation. Confused, Agatha glanced out the window, trying to figure out what exactly Rio was looking at— because surely, it couldn’t be her.</p><p>Then it clicked.</p><p>“Fuck no. You dragged me all the way here and you refused to order from inside the car.“</p><p>“You did not see the line?!”</p><p>“Rio, I’m not going in.”</p><p>“Agatha, I drove.”</p><p>“You were the one who insisted we come!” Agatha almost yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes later, Agatha was walking into the damn McDonald’s.</p><p>As expected, it seemed like plenty of people had the same craving as Rio that Saturday evening. Agatha cursed Rio at least eight times from the moment the greasy fast-food smell hit her nose to the second she picked one of the four lines to stand in.</p><p>“Am I hallucinating, or is Agatha Harkness actually standing in a McDonald's line... without a gun to her head?” Natasha suddenly spoke up, standing next to Agatha between her line and the next one over.</p><p>Agatha turned toward her and mentally cursed Rio ten more times.</p><p>“You <em> are </em> hallucinating. Go away.” Agatha  answered and crossed her arms, her gaze shifting to the cashier— who, of course, didn’t look a day over fifteen and was struggling to open the register.</p><p>Natasha chuckled and mirrored her stance.</p><p>“You live around here?” </p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you come here often, then?” Natasha took a step closer, her voice dropping to an almost-whisper.</p><p>“No, I don’t. And you’re really out here resorting to ridiculous flirting in a McDonald’s.” </p><p>Agatha stepped forward as the line moved, and Natasha followed suit.</p><p>“It’s not desperation, it’s…” Natasha tapped her index finger against her chin, pretending to search for a word Agatha knew was already at the tip of her tongue. “Attachment.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Attachment my ass.” </p><p>“To that too, hon.” Natasha smirked and Agatha wanted to punch that smile right off her face.</p><p>Agatha ignored her, turning her face to the side like a sulking child. Natasha, of course, didn’t back down.</p><p>“What are you doing after this? I’d be more than happy to ditch Yelena.”</p><p>“Nothing with you, that’s for sure.”</p><p>“Oh, so with someone, then? Is that why you wouldn’t pick up my calls? Didn’t want to talk to me in front of your little girlfriend?” Natasha teased, letting out a sarcastic laugh.</p><p>Agatha was next in line, and she just took a deep breath, ignoring Natasha's questions for her own good and physical well-being.</p><p>“Why are you here, Natasha?”</p><p>“I brought my little sister to get some of this horrible American food.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, air hissing through her nostrils.</p><p>“You know, I always liked it when you got angry. Not that it's hard to make you mad, but... it definitely makes me feel things.” Natasha smirked.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, still struggling to wrap her mind around how Natasha had gone from ‘the one I loved who walked away’ to ‘the biggest bitch to ever walk this planet.’</p><p>“I thought I could have a conversation with you, but it's impossible. Forget it. Just fucking leave, Natasha.”</p><p>Before Natasha could reply, it was Agatha's turn. She placed her order, paid, and stepped aside to wait. Natasha stayed silent next to her, Agatha's shoulder nearly brushing against Natasha's from how close they were standing.</p><p>“You used to like it when I intentionally pissed you off, don’t you remember? At all those conferences we went to, our best sex was always after heated arguments in hotel hallways.”</p><p>Agatha would’ve lied if she said she didn’t feel a shiver run down her spine. Whether it was from anger, indignation, or something else, she wasn’t sure. Taking the safer route, she replied, “Past tense. If your intention is to keep reminiscing about our seven years together, I’m not interested. If you actually have something to say, we can meet somewhere, you say whatever the fuck you want so badly, and leave me alone. For good.”</p><p>Natasha stayed silent for a minute, her smile now replaced by a more serious expression, as if she were weighing Agatha's response.</p><p>“Fine, Agatha. I expect a text from you next week. Otherwise, you know I have ways to find you,” Natasha said, her words coming out as a challenge.</p><p>She took a step back but then something seemed to change her mind. She moved two steps forward, her body now close to Agatha’s, who turned her face away to avoid her nose brushing against Natasha’s hair. “When you’re done playing with whoever this <em> woman </em>is, meet me. I still remember exactly how you like it.” She placed a small rectangular paper into Agatha’s hand and pulled away with a smile.</p><p>Natasha left, but her perfume lingered. Agatha rubbed her nose vehemently and returned to the counter, where the attendant, who was finishing wrapping her takeout, looked at her suspiciously. </p><p>She sighed, grabbed the order, and turned away.</p><p>As she exited the establishment, she glanced sideways at the trash can against the wall perpendicular to the door. She ignored it and made her way to the car.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha frantically rummaged through hangers, shelves, and drawers, making an even bigger mess than her eight-year-old had managed to make in the fifteen days since she last organized everything.</p><p>Since her encounter with Natasha, she had been... What was it the kids would say these days? </p><p>Skittish. </p><p>The hotel business card Natasha had given her spent the weekend buried in the back pocket of her jeans until Sunday, right after Rio left— that’s when Agatha shoved it into her work bag instead.</p><p>While Rio was at her place, she knew that tossing it in the trash at home wasn’t the smartest move. Rio was meticulous about sorting the trash, and there was a high chance she’d find it at some point.</p><p>After Rio left, Agatha blamed exhaustion for not consciously thinking twice before pulling the crumpled card from her jeans and shoving it under a pile of loose papers in her work bag.</p><p>However, even after making her peace with the decision to keep it to herself, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that almost every aspect of her life was resting on shaky ground.</p><p>Her relationship with Rio, which with each night they shared a bed felt less and less like the casual arrangement she had convinced herself it was, and kept her in a constant state of fight-or-flight.</p><p>Nicky, who spent the rest of Sunday clinging to her more than was considered healthy for a mother-son relationship, but didn’t open up for any kind of conversation and shut down whenever Agatha tried.</p><p>And, of course, there was her non-relationship with Natasha. Every piece of advice she’d gotten on how to handle her ex felt worse than the last— punch her, fuck her, or block her until she inevitably showed up like a fucking ghost at her doorstep.</p><p>The only thing in her life that felt solid was her work.</p><p>Her classes, her research project, the new course starting that very day. </p><p>A course that Rio would be attending. </p><p>A situation where Rio would <em> literally </em> be her student, and any relationship beyond professor and student was entirely inappropriate.</p><p>Fuck, nevermind. </p><p>Suddenly, obsessing over finding her son’s jacket —even while they were already late— didn’t seem so aggravating anymore.</p><p>“Are you sure you didn’t leave it at the twins’ house?" Agatha asked while searching for the third time through Nicky’s wardrobe for his sage jacket.</p><p>“Yes, mom,” he replied, crossing his arms and watching as she crouched down and stood back up repeatedly in front of the wardrobe.</p><p>“Not at your dad’s either?”</p><p>“I told you I didn’t leave it there!”</p><p>“Hey, watch your tone.” She turned to him.  “I have no idea where this jacket is, Nicky. Can’t you wear a different one to school today?” She asked, patience laced in her voice. </p><p>He only pouted in response.</p><p>“Nicky, we’re running late, and if I have to walk you to school because your first class has already started, mom will be even later. We don’t want that, do we?” </p><p>He completely ignored her, saying instead, ”I don’t wanna go to aunt Wanda’s today."</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and walked over to him. He was sitting at the edge of the bed, so she crouched down to kneel in front of him, careful not to wrinkle her pants. “Look, honey, I have to work late today, which is why we agreed you’d spend the night there. And you like playing with the twins, don’t you?"</p><p>“I do, but sometimes they bug me and won’t stop bothering me. I’d rather stay with you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, reaching out to gently squeeze and caress his cheek. "I’d love to stay with you too, honey." She stood up and sat beside him on the bed. "Tell you what— if you behave at Aunt Wanda’s today and finish your homework, we’ll get that Nintendo game you wanted and play it together this weekend. How does that sound?”</p><p>Even though Agatha knew it wasn’t the best parenting strategy, she couldn’t shake the growing discomfort over how much Nicky’s behavior had changed in the past few weeks. What she initially brushed off as just a phase was starting to become a real concern, especially since he outright refused to talk to her whenever she tried to bring it up.</p><p>That was why, despite knowing better, she smiled along with him when he finally got excited about something for the first time in days. He responded with several eager “yeses” and wrapped his arms around her, and for a moment, Agatha felt reassured.</p><p>With the promise of a new game and some quality time together, Nicky agreed to wear a different jacket. </p><p>Still running late, the two of them dashed down the stairs and out to the car.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha had wrapped up her classes for the day and had some free time before she needed to head to the classroom where the course would take place. </p><p>In her office, she stood in front of a locker, both doors wide open, with William hovering behind her.</p><p>“Sure we stored it here? I distinctly remember saying I didn’t want all that crap crammed into my office," Agatha said, scanning the labels stuck to the dozens of folders lining one of the shelves.</p><p>“Not sure sure—“ Will replied, scratching his back with one hand.</p><p>Agatha turned to him, eyes narrowed. “You said it was definitely here!” She snapped, her voice slightly raised. "You look for it, then. I’m sitting down, and don’t bother me on your way out.”</p><p>She brushed past him and sank onto the couch, nearly giving in to the temptation of lying down for a few minutes before she had to leave again. But she knew it was already a small miracle that her clothes weren’t wrinkled after the whole day.</p><p>Agatha wore a gray pantsuit with a matching button-up shirt underneath. The tailored pants were slightly loose, cinched at the waist with a black belt. She stretched out her legs, resting her black heeled ankle boots on the coffee table.</p><p>Her head tilted back against the couch, eyes closed. The only sound in the room was William rummaging through the locker.</p><p>At least, that was the case until a familiar voice called out from somewhere near the door. "I see the preparations are… under control?" Rio grinned, making Agatha open her eyes and turn her head in her direction— just as William also turned to face the student.</p><p>“Hey Rio, long time no see.” He greeted her with a smile before walking over and pulling her into a hug. Agatha remained seated, watching the two of them.</p><p>“Yeah, getting my ass kicked doesn’t leave me with much free time," Rio quipped.</p><p>Both laughed.</p><p>“You’re attending Agatha’s class, right? We’re heading there soon, wanna come with us?”</p><p>Rio craned her neck slightly to glance at Agatha, who had closed her eyes again, seemingly ignoring their conversation. She then turned back to Will.</p><p>“Yeah I am, but— Uh, Alice is waiting for you at the cafeteria. She wants to set up a few things with you, not sure what exactly, she didn’t explain much— well—“ </p><p>If Rio had come in with a solid excuse to get Agatha alone, she was doing a terrible job executing it.</p><p>Will squinted at her, but ultimately accepted Rio’s jumbled explanation without further questioning. ”Ah, I was meaning to grab a coffee before heading in anyway. Agatha, do you need anything else? I’ll find the folder later— we don’t need it until Friday, right?”</p><p>“I said not to bother me.” Agatha replied. The lack of response, followed by the sound of the door closing, told her Will had left.</p><p>“Sweetheart? Everything alright?” Rio asked, approaching the couch carefully, as if Agatha were a startled cat with its back arched and claws out.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha answered, opening her eyes to find Rio standing on the other side of the coffee table, watching her. “Really smooth, by the way.” She deadpanned.</p><p>Rio smiled, unfazed. She remained standing, her tongue pressing against the inside of her cheek, eyes trailing along the length of Agatha’s body.</p><p>It took Agatha three seconds of holding her gaze to know exactly where Rio's mind was wandering.</p><p>“You do realize I have to leave in ten minutes, right? Or better yet, you’re aware we’re in my office with the door unlocked?”</p><p>“I can lock it if that’s the issue.”</p><p>“Not the point.”</p><p>Rio smirked and tapped Agatha’s knees, signaling for her to take her feet off the coffee table. When she did, Rio slid into her lap.</p><p>“How am I supposed to pay attention to a single word you say when looking like this?” Rio whispered into her ear, fingers threading through Agatha’s hair, nails just shy of scratching her scalp.</p><p>Agatha parted her lips in a soundless gasp. “You better behave during my class, or I won’t be nice to you later tonight.”</p><p>“Are you inviting me to sleep at your house?”</p><p>“No, Rio, I’m not inviting you. I’m ordering you to.”</p><p>Agatha barely had time to notice the black taking over Rio's pupils before Rio started kissing her, all teeth and tongue. Despite all the internal debates and conflicts that morning, it was clear that all of Agatha’s common sense slipped away just as quickly as the arousal threatened to seep through her underwear.</p><p>“Please let me taste you.” Rio murmured between kisses, the vibration of her voice against Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“Later, baby—“ Agatha managed to answer, and Rio began to scatter kisses across the exposed skin of her collarbone.</p><p>“I can make you cum in less than ten minutes.”</p><p>Yes, Agatha was having a lapse in judgment, but she wasn't completely mental. When Rio's long fingers started to undo her belt, Agatha grabbed her wrist. “Rio, Rio— not here,” she said breathlessly.</p><p>Rio straightened up, still sitting on Agatha’s lap, and threw her head back with a long sigh. “Fuck, yeah, sorry—“</p><p>A knocking at the door caused both women to snap their necks in its direction, and Rio leapt off Agatha's lap as if she were on fire.</p><p>In a similar reaction, Agatha leapt to her feet and rushed to the door, adjusting her shirt and belt.</p><p>When she opened the door, Jen stood with one hand on her hip, inspecting her nails. She raised her gaze to Agatha, who appeared more composed than she felt.</p><p>“Aren’t you coming?” </p><p>Jen didn’t wait for Agatha to answer and forced her way into the office, facing Rio standing by the couch; her lips swollen and red, keeping her cool far less than Agatha.</p><p>Jen smirked, turning back to Agatha. “Oh, I see. I expect an appreciation card someday, Agatha, because Dr. Danvers was planning to come after you, and I volunteered in her place.” Jen glanced at Rio. “I had a feeling my dearest student would be here.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, glancing at the clock and realizing she really needed to leave before she was late for her first class. “The thank-you basket will be arriving any moment now,” she said, gesturing toward the door. “Tell Carol I’m on my way.”</p><p>“Everyone’s already waiting for you, Agatha,” Jen murmured, rolling her eyes. Before leaving the office, she pointed at Rio. “Vidal, don’t hold her up here, or I’ll have Danvers come to get her.”</p><p>With Kale out of the office and the door shut again, Agatha went to her desk to grab her laptop, cables, and phone while Rio remained silently by the door, waiting for her.</p><p>She put on her matching blazer, ensuring she had everything —she wasn’t risking taking her bag with that damn hotel card still inside— and Agatha was ready to open the door when Rio stopped her.</p><p>“Good luck, sweetheart.” Rio gave her a quick kiss before stepping back.</p><p>Smiling, Agatha murmured a “Thank you, baby,” against her lips, and they both left the office and then the building.</p><p>-</p><p>With the laptop and projector properly set up in the classroom, Agatha stood in the faculty-designated corner of the room next to Carol. Some students were still arriving, filling the tiered seating with wooden-backed chairs and small foldable desks attached.</p><p>“Aggie, we should go out for drinks tonight as a reward. The first day is always the hardest,” Carol suggested, shifting her gaze from the last students arriving to Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I’m so exhausted that any alcohol at this point would probably have the same effect as Lorazepam,” Agatha replied, earning a laugh from Carol— loud enough to draw the attention of a few nearby students. Rio included.</p><p>“Let me get you a cappuccino from the faculty lounge machine,” Carol offered.</p><p>“No need, Carol, truly. I’m about to start.”</p><p>Carol gave her a knowing smile, placing a hand on Agatha’s bicep. “It’ll be quick, Aggie. If you’ve already started by the time I get back, I’ll just leave it on the table in the back.” She gave a gentle squeeze before slipping out through one of the back doors.</p><p>Agatha was double-checking that her laptop charger was plugged into a working outlet when her phone buzzed in her pocket.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">totally cool about this </p><p align="right">;)</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned, glancing over at Rio, who sat beside Alice and William. While Alice and Will were deep in conversation, Rio was watching her— smirk firmly in place.</p><p> </p><p>

<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">i am</p><p align="right">i haven’t even tackled anyone who said you’re smoking hot yet</p><p align="right">which you are, btw</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, smiling, before silencing her phone and slipping it back into her pocket. She adjusted the room’s lighting— dimming it just enough to prevent reflection on the projector screen while still allowing her to see every student’s face, even in the highest row.</p><p>As the lights shifted, the chatter gradually faded into complete silence.</p><p>“Good evening, everyone.” </p><p>A collective response came from the students, and Agatha continued, “I assume most of you already know who I am. For those who don’t, my name is Agatha Harkness. I’m a professor of Criminal Law and Law and Psychology here at the university.”</p><p>The first noticeable difference between students familiar with her reputation and those who weren’t became clear in that instant. As soon as she said her name, a few students —men— whistled, while others chuckled quietly.</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue and was about to reprimand the motherfuckers when someone did it first.</p><p>“Won’t you shut the hell up?” The previously silent room echoed with Rio’s voice as she stood up and turned toward the group of guys.</p><p>“Geez, Vidal, chill out.” A male voice answered, followed by murmurs of agreement from the other male students.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth and judging by her expression, whatever she was about to say would be neither polite nor calm. Before she could, Agatha intervened. </p><p>“Alright, let’s get one thing straight before this course even begins,” she said, watching as Rio sat back down, arms crossed. “One more desperate attempt for attention from needy little boys, and I assure you, I’ll have new students filling your seats with the snap of my fingers. Am I clear?”</p><p>You could hear a hair pin drop. Even without a single acknowledgment, Agatha clapped her hands together and continued as if nothing had happened. </p><p>“Very well then. Let’s begin.”</p><p>With the projector remote in her left hand, she started her lecture. Her voice was steady and commanding, effortlessly drawing in every gaze as she began. “Lawyers are absolutely crucial to tackling several environmental crises. Now, let me be completely honest with you: I’m not an environmental or climate change lawyer, nor am I a net-zero expert.”</p><p>Agatha paced slowly from one side of the room to the other, her gaze sweeping over the students without settling on any one of them in particular.</p><p>“When I was first approached about this course, that was my initial thought: How on earth am I, someone whose entire career has been focused on Criminal Law and Criminology, supposed to stand in front of hundreds of students and talk about environmental crises? No, that’s insane."</p><p>“And yet, not for a second did I consider turning down the invitation. Not once. And no, it had absolutely <em> nothing </em> to do with Calderu’s persuasion skills.” She smiled, earning a few chuckles from the class.</p><p>“In my initial research, I came across a rather intriguing affirmation: ‘You are all climate lawyers now.’ This was said to the American Bar Association, and it didn’t take much research for me to completely agree with that statement."</p><p>“Hang on, hang on— that doesn’t mean I’ll be representing any of you in court. I left that life behind years ago.” Among the laughter, Agatha caught a sound she had come to recognize anywhere, no matter the crowd. Her eyes instinctively found Rio, who sat with a wide, adoring smile on her lips. Agatha forced herself to keep her expression neutral, resisting the urge to mirror it.</p><p>“What I mean is that, due to the development of studies on environmental issues starting in the 1960s, a new frontier emerged, significantly shaping the way we view Criminal Law and Criminology in recent decades. Criminal Law and Criminology found themselves once again responsible for regulating behaviors that traditionally fell outside their scope. Not that unusual in my field. This shift was driven by a new way of looking at the environment, one that views nature as an entity with intrinsic value. As a result, key aspects of Criminal Law theory have been impacted.”</p><p>Agatha noticed movement behind her and turned her head just in time to see Carol placing a mug on the desk. Carol gave her a thumbs-up and a smile before retreating to the corner of the room.</p><p>When Agatha looked back at the students, she didn’t miss the scowl on Rio’s face.</p><p>“Today, we will focus on strict liability, a fundamental principle in environmental Law and plays a key role in cases of environmental damage, especially when caused by corporations. However, as we discussed in the seminar for those who attended, applying it to Criminal Law presents challenges since it conflicts with the fundamental principle that criminal liability cannot be imposed objectively.”</p><p>Agatha reached for one of the water bottles and took a sip, all too aware of Rio's gaze on her. If she had to spend the entire lecture avoiding looking in Rio’s direction because she looked ready to leap from her seat and devour her, it was going to be a very long class.</p><p>Clearing her throat, Agatha pressed the projector control button. “Shall we begin?”</p><p>-</p><p>Yes, the class was <em> fucking </em> long— courtesy of Rio <em> fucking </em> Vidal and her incessant staring.</p><p><br/>It had been over ten minutes since Agatha wrapped up, and a number of students had lined up to speak with her— some with questions they hadn't had time to ask, others wondering about the prospect of participating in one of her research projects.</p><p>Carol had said her goodbyes the moment class ended, but for some reason, William, Alice, and Rio had remained just outside the line, chatting among themselves as if this were a bar and not a lecture hall.</p><p>Exhausted, Agatha snapped her fingers to grab the attention of the remaining students and announced, “If you have any questions about today’s class, find me in my office during work hours. If you're here about research opportunities, the project has already started and all spots are filled. So don’t waste your time— or mine.”</p><p>There were fewer complaints than she expected, and soon the line dispersed, leaving only Agatha, Rio, and Alice— William having left, hand in hand with one of the guys who had been waiting.</p><p>“Very impressive.” Rio spoke from beside Alice, both watching as Agatha powered down the last of the equipment.</p><p>Agatha kept fiddling with the projector —which felt like a fucking transformer compared to what she was used to— and muttered a quiet “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow and stepped closer, resting a hand on Agatha’s back. “Let me do it, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and stepped away to gather her things. She was severely annoyed— and it was entirely Rio’s fault. The way she had spent the entire lecture staring at Agatha so intensely had left her fucking wet, and now her damp underwear was beyond uncomfortable. Not to mention the number of times she had to keep herself in check so she wouldn’t lose her train of thought mid-sentence.</p><p>Having Alice standing there, staring at her like she was some kind of freak show, wasn’t doing anything to improve Agatha’s mood.</p><p>“Why are you still here?” Agatha asked, lifting her head toward Alice.</p><p>“Waiting for Rio?” Alice replied, eyes widening momentarily when Rio turned to her, clearly asking for backup.</p><p>Rio frowned. “Why? I’m going to Agatha’s.” </p><p>“Tonight?”</p><p>“Yeah? I thought I told you.”</p><p>“You didn’t! I can’t believe I’ve been waiting here this whole time for nothing. Fuck, Rio.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Why would I still be here?”</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe because you seem like you’re glued to her—“</p><p>“If you two are going to keep this babble going, turn off the lights before you leave. I’m heading home.” Agatha said, too tired to sit through their back-and-forth any longer. She pushed open the back door, not bothering to close it because she knew Rio would follow.</p><p>“M’lady is calling, bye.” Rio said before leaving Alice behind. </p><p>Agatha chose to ignore Gulliver’s next words: “Use protection!”.</p><p>-</p><p>The drive to Agatha’s house was filled with random Spotify songs, Rio humming along with her hand on Agatha’s thigh. Almost… domestic, one might say.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t spent the entire ride tracing lines from Agatha’s knee to the inside of her thigh, her skilled fingers teasingly close to where Agatha wanted them most, it might have felt even more so. The mere proximity of those fingers sent shivers through Agatha, surprised her pants didn’t show a damp patch.</p><p>Agatha ignored Rio’s curious glances as they arrived at her house and didn’t answer her question about grabbing something to eat; she simply took Rio’s hand firmly and led her upstairs.</p><p>By the time they reached her bedroom, the two were already kissing fervently, hands sliding through hair, around waists, over asses. Agatha tried to push Rio toward the bed, but Rio was insistent, holding onto Agatha’s belt, so every time Agatha pushed, they inched a few steps closer to the bed.</p><p>Tired, turned on, and impatient, Agatha grabbed a handful of Rio’s hair and pulled her head back, forcing her lips away from Agatha’s and eliciting a grunt at the tug.</p><p>“Take off your clothes and lie down,” Agatha said, leaving no room for Rio to try to regain any sense of dominance. Rio didn’t seem to mind, probably because she was just as desperate as Agatha.</p><p>Agatha removed her blazer, and while Rio fumbled to take off her clothes, she went to her closet to retrieve a package that had caused her major anxiety spikes over the past few days— fear of it being delivered to the wrong house, fear of Nicky getting to it before her, fear of the packaging not being as discreet as the website promised.</p><p>Returning to the main area of the bedroom, Rio was completely naked, leaning back against the headboard. She seemed disappointed that Agatha was still fully dressed, and without taking her eyes off Agatha’s body, Rio didn’t pay attention to the box she was holding.</p><p>With the box on the edge of the bed, Agatha was taking off her boots when Rio spoke, her voice urgent, “Why you’re taking so long?!” </p><p>Agatha smirked and climbed onto the bed, straddling Rio. Of course, the first thing Rio did was remove Agatha’s belt, as apparently, Rio had developed a fixation on it in the last few hours.</p><p>Before Rio could toss it aside, Agatha grabbed her wrist.</p><p>“I still have plans for this belt.”</p><p>Agatha elevated Rio's hands, one fist on top of the other. With her other hand, she threaded the belt through the gap in the headboard and around Rio's wrists, securing it tightly.</p><p>“If it hurts, tell me.”</p><p>“I don’t care if it does.” Rio said, making Agatha smile. </p><p>With Rio restrained, Agatha took her time removing her clothes. She ignored Rio’s pleas, which sounded like an incoherent mix of curses, Agatha’s name, and requests for her to come closer.</p><p>Agatha returned to the bed and, with a leg on either side of Rio’s body, she consciously stayed supported on her knees and arched her back as much as she could, eliciting a moan from Rio as she saw Agatha hovering over her in that position.</p><p>“You’re going to kill me, Agatha.” Rio said as Agatha began to trace the tip of her tongue from Rio’s belly button up to her collarbone.</p><p>Agatha retraced her path, and when her tongue was moving upward again, she took a detour and circled a hardened nipple. Rio moaned, arching her back, and Agatha’s lips followed the movement.</p><p>She pressed her tongue against Rio’s nipple and enveloped it with her mouth, making Rio moan and tremble beneath her.</p><p>Agatha pulled away from her breast and moved closer to her face. She bit Rio’s lower lip hard, sucking on it afterward but didn’t let Rio initiate a kiss and pulled away again. If Rio had magical powers, she would have shattered the belt into a million pieces.</p><p>“Do you think I didn’t notice you eye-fucking me during my class?” Agatha whispered in her ear and bit the area of her neck just below her earlobe.</p><p>“You’re lucky that’s all I did,” Rio replied in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Is this a kink of yours? Showing your classmates that you’re fucking me?”</p><p>“Yes— shit, Agatha, I want everyone to know it’s me who gets to fuck you.”</p><p>“Tonight, you’ll find out what it’s like to be fucked by the Witch.” Agatha bit and sucked on Rio’s neck, surprised she didn’t taste the metallic taste of blood. Rio hissed, attempting in vain to move her neck away from Agatha's attacks.</p><p>Agatha leaned back on her heels and bent Rio’s leg. She positioned herself with Rio’s thigh between her legs and slowly lowered herself until her center made contact with Rio’s skin. Both of them moaned at the same time.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re dripping all over my leg.”</p><p>Agatha looked down and, sure enough, Rio’s leg was wet with thick drops of liquid running down her skin. She used Rio’s shoulder as support for one hand while she rode Rio’s thigh, very aware that just that friction would make her come rather fast. With her other hand, Agatha slid her fingers into Rio’s pussy, which was just as soaked as hers.</p><p>She gathered as much of Rio’s juices as she could with three fingers, amidst Rio’s moans, who followed the movement of her hand to her mouth. Agatha pushed the three fingers into her mouth up to the knuckles, moaning as she tasted Rio.</p><p>When the known sensation began to stir in her lower stomach, Agatha climbed off Rio’s leg and pretended not to be surprised by the obscene amount of arousal covering Rio’s thigh. Agatha needed to cum, and she needed to cum fast, but the Witch would never give Rio the satisfaction of making her cum on a thigh in three minutes.</p><p>On her knees between Rio’s legs, which were now bent, Agatha lowered only the upper part of her body, her ass raised. No longer trying to drive Rio crazy because she knew the possibility of Rio tearing her own skin trying to escape the belt restraint was very real, Agatha began to devour Rio’s pussy like a starving woman.</p><p>“FUCK—“ Rio screamed with Agatha’s tongue flickering against her clit, sharp and precise, familiar with the most sensitive spots that she knew would get the job done.</p><p>With her wrists bound above her head, Rio’s moans grew louder, her body writhing against the restraints, but Agatha kept her pace steady, relentless. Agatha didn’t realize she was moaning along with Rio, but the work of her tongue combined with the vibrations of her moans against Rio’s cunt were enough.</p><p>When Rio’s thighs began to tremble, Agatha sucked her clit into her mouth, her tongue circling and flicking until Rio’s back arched off the bed, clamping her legs around Agatha’s head so tightly that she could feel her ear piercings pressing into her skin.</p><p>Agatha slowed the intensity of her tongue’s movements as Rio came down from the high of her orgasm, stopping entirely when Rio began to spasm.</p><p>Agatha sat back on her heels again and smiled at the sight of Rio on the bed: sweaty, breathing heavily, and cheeks flushed. Rio had her eyes closed, probably trying to catch her breath while Agatha reached for the box to pull out the harness and the green strap-on. She knew Rio’s favorite color was green, and what could be more thoughtful than fucking her with a cock in her favorite color?</p><p>Noticing Agatha’s movements as she adjusted the strap, Rio opened her eyes and gasped.</p><p>“Shit, Agatha, I need a sec— wait, since when do you have this?”</p><p>“Does it matter?”</p><p>“No, but… You’re kinda fulfilling a dream of mine.” Rio said. Agatha smirked, and with the strap secured between her legs, she spread Rio’s legs with very little tenderness.</p><p>“Agatha, calm down, I just need a minute—” Rio recalled as she watched Agatha position herself between her legs with a mischievous smile on her face.</p><p>Agatha slid two fingers between Rio’s folds, and before Rio could make a sound, she pushed those same two fingers into her cunt.</p><p>Instantly, Rio moaned and spread her legs even wider.</p><p>“It looks like you’re all ready for me.” Agatha murmured, pulling her soaked fingers out and positioning herself over Rio. She centered the tip of the strap against Rio’s entrance. </p><p>Unlike Rio’s strap, this one had multiple speeds, and Agatha turned it up to the maximum. She moaned as soon as she felt the vibration against her clit and briefly wondered if this hadn’t been her brightest idea, but the way Rio looked at her left no room for second-guessing.</p><p>With the vibrating cock, she rubbed it along Rio’s pussy, who moaned in anticipation. Once the strap was sufficiently wet with Rio’s arousal, Agatha slowly pushed it in, giving Rio time to adjust to the size.</p><p>“Fuck, it’s big— your cock is big.” Rio moaned with her eyes closed in the first few times when Agatha was still keeping a slow pace. Agatha slid one hand down to Rio’s ass and squeezed, forcing her to lift her leg and rest it on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>In this position, Agatha could thrust the strap all the way in, and she began to increase the speed until the only sounds besides Rio’s moans —no, screams— were the slapping of their bodies together.</p><p>“Look at me.” Agatha commanded, placing her left hand on Rio’s neck, squeezing to force her to obey. Rio’s eyes snapped open.</p><p>“You take me so,” Agatha pushed her hips as far as she could against Rio, “so,” and again, “well.” And again. Rio screamed each time, tears pooling beneath her eyes.</p><p>Agatha used Rio’s neck as support, making sure she wasn’t squeezing the middle of her throat, and continued to fuck her even as sweat dripped down her body and her legs protested.</p><p>“Agatha, fu-fuck, don’t st-top.” Rio managed to say, the vibration of her throat under Agatha’s hand. Agatha used her thumb and middle finger to squeeze her neck again.</p><p>“You’re cumming for me, baby?” </p><p>Rio gripped the headboard with her fingertips, her wrists still straining uncontrollably against the belt’s material.</p><p>“Yes-yeplease—“ </p><p>Agatha was releasing Rio’s neck when she moaned several “No”.</p><p>“You’re such a whore for me, aren't you?” Agatha smiled and squeezed her neck even tighter, this time even more determined to fuck this dream of a woman until she passed out if necessary.</p><p>She slowed down the pace of thrusting the strap into Rio’s cunt and focused on making it harder, angling the strap to hit the spot she knew Rio couldn’t resist. In no time, Rio began moaning Agatha’s name, her legs trembling violently, the one draped over Agatha’s shoulder slipping as Rio no longer had the strength to hold it up.</p><p>Agatha held onto her raised leg and continued thrusting hard until Rio’s orgasm made her body practically convulse beneath her. Agatha picked up the pace again, no longer concerned with the strength, until Rio stuttered, begging Agatha to stop because she was too sensitive.</p><p>Agatha pulled the cock out of Rio and turned off the vibrator but kept the harness and strap on. She reached up to undo the belt pin and free Rio’s wrists, which fell limply to her sides.</p><p>As utterly spent as Rio was, Agatha wasn’t. On the contrary, with every minute she went without release, she seemed more determined to fuck Rio in every way she could.</p><p>That said, Agatha turned Rio’s limp body over on the bed, leaving her face down. She grabbed the belt again and looped it around Rio’s ankles, tying them firmly together. Rio wasn’t even aware of what was happening until Agatha climbed on top of her and began kissing and licking her sweaty neck.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re going to fucking kill me,” Rio said, her voice muffled by the pillow.</p><p>“All fours for me, baby.” Agatha whispered in Rio's ear and was pleasantly surprised when she actually obeyed. It was rare for Rio to cum more than twice, and every time Agatha tried for a third, Rio’s body was so sensitive it was almost impossible to touch her.</p><p>Rio managed to stay on all fours even with her legs threatening to give out beneath her, and this didn’t go unnoticed by Agatha, who placed both hands on her hips to hold her in place.</p><p>With her ankles tied, Rio couldn’t spread her legs, forcing Agatha to quickly remove her hands from her hips and pull her cheeks apart to slide the strap back into Rio. Rio let out such a long moan that she choked and piled up Agatha’s pillows to support her head.</p><p>With the vibrator turned back on, Agatha thrust her hips against Rio’s ass, who was a mess of moans and curses under her breath. Agatha held her firmly in place, occasionally sliding one hand down to squeeze her ass.</p><p>“Agatha, fuck my pussy, yeah— f-f-uck—”  Rio murmured into the pillow, one hand braced against the headboard to steady herself against Agatha’s thrusts.</p><p>Fucking Rio from behind was going to drive her wild, Agatha was sure of that.</p><p>“Your cunt was made for me, fuck—“ Agatha focused on not letting the vibration against her clit distract her, especially as she felt her orgasm coming closer.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem much better, now with her face buried in the pillow and occasionally turning her head to watch Agatha fucking her. She had dried tear streaks and fresh ones running down her face, feeling the size of the strap even more now that her legs were practically closed.</p><p>Agatha, sensing her climax was unavoidable, thrust into Rio fast, trying to go as deep as possible with each thrust, and began muttering random words, aching for her own release.</p><p>“Ohgod, fuck, god—“ Rio screamed, drawing Agatha’s attention again, who reached around with her left hand to Rio’s clit and began making much less coordinated movements than she intended with her fingertips.</p><p>Rio’s moans and screams became even more obscene, and Agatha felt like she might pass out from sheer lust.</p><p>“Fuck, I’m gonna cum insi-side you.”</p><p>“Yes, fuck, cum in my pussy, <em> love </em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain didn’t register the last word in time, not when Rio was fucking crying as another orgasm hit her in one strong wave, and Agatha came with the same intensity, one hand on Rio’s clit and the other with her fingers buried in the skin of her ass.</p><p>Agatha pulled the strap out of Rio’s cunt and desperately began trying to turn off the vibrator, which seemed like it was going to make her own clit explode from oversensitivity. She ripped off the harness, with the strap now off, and tossed it to the floor. Before lying down, she untied Rio’s ankles.</p><p>Lying down next to Rio, who remained face down, Agatha was breathing heavily, and her heart was pounding in a way that made it not entirely absurd to think she might be having a heart attack.</p><p>Agatha didn’t dare say anything, not when being called ‘love’ was still ringing in her ears. Rio, on the other hand, either didn’t notice what she had said or didn’t give it much importance, because once she caught her breath, she turned toward Agatha and draped half her body over hers.</p><p>Too spent for words and thoughts, Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s body, holding her close as Rio’s body seemed to melt into hers— both falling asleep in that same position not long after.</p><p> </p>

<p>“You cannot be serious, Agatha. I’m not walking three blocks to campus.”</p><p>Rio spoke from the passenger seat, her tone flat as Agatha casually suggested she walk a few blocks to avoid the risk of anyone seeing them arrive at the university together.</p><p>“What about one? One and a half?” Agatha tried again, only to be met with a sharp glare from Rio.</p><p>“You know, it’s not my fault that you decided it’d be a great idea to actually attend my class. You’re literally my student now—“</p><p>Rio cut her off. “What difference does that make? It’s not like you were in any hurry to let people know about us anyway.”</p><p>“It makes a huge difference!” Agatha snapped, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Besides, why didn’t you go home first? You’re still wearing the same clothes from yesterday.”</p><p>As they pulled into the parking lot in front of the Criminal Justice building, Agatha nearly drove over the curb, too busy scanning the area to see if anyone was walking too close to her parking space.</p><p>Rio pretended not to notice. “I’m spending the whole day in the lab, so… By the way, I do recall someone promising me a visit this week."</p><p>“Maybe tomorrow?” Agatha spoke as she parked the car.</p><p>“Can’t tomorrow, sweetheart. Why don’t you stop by around lunchtime today? It’s always empty.”</p><p>Both unfastened their seatbelts, and when Rio leaned over the gear shift to kiss Agatha, Agatha instinctively pulled back, catching Rio’s wrist midair before it could reach her neck.</p><p>“Not here, and we should—“ The words died on her lips as her gaze dropped to where she was holding Rio. Agatha pushed up the sleeve of her shirt, revealing the full extent of the area.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio! Why didn’t you say anything last night?” </p><p>The skin around Rio’s wrists was red and bruised in several places. Judging by the way Rio winced as Agatha examined them, it was clearly sore.</p><p>“I didn’t feel it.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look.</p><p>“I’m telling you, I barely noticed it yesterday. I only saw it this morning.”</p><p>“I’m sorry—“</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay, really.” Rio reassured her. “Of course I will accept a lunch visit today as a formal apology for leaving me all bruised while fucking me for hours tied to your bed.”</p><p>-</p><p>It was almost lunchtime when Agatha stepped into the faculty lounge.</p><p>She switched on the kettle and sighed, eyeing her vast selection of exactly three tea options. Just as she reached for one, Wanda walked in, laughing, with none other than Jen Kale trailing behind her.</p><p>“Wrong building, Jen.” Agatha called over her shoulder.</p><p>Jen and Wanda settled at one of the round tables near the counter.</p><p>“Hello to you too, Harkness. How strange, my basket hasn’t arrived yet. Maybe something happened to your delivery guy?”</p><p>“What basket?” Wanda asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Jen shot Agatha a knowing look, and Agatha rolled her eyes before muttering, “She knows.”</p><p>“Knows what? What’s up with all the codes today, ladies?!” Wanda demanded, looking between them.</p><p>“About Rio.” </p><p>Wanda's eyes widened as she turned to Jen. “How the hell do you know?”</p><p>Before Jen could launch into her version of events —which was bound to be at least seventy percent more exaggerated than reality— Agatha cut in, “She saw me with Rio in Eastview.” Then, before anyone could drag the conversation further into her personal life, she changed the subject. “Anyway, as much as my life seems to be the hot topic of the faculty lounge… Jen, I need a TA for my course.”</p><p>“Don’t you have Kaplan?”</p><p>“I do, but he’s already handling my classes and research project. I can’t dump this on him too, or the kid is gonna freak out.”</p><p>“Get Vidal.” Wanda chimed in, shrugging, drawing looks from both Agatha and Jen.</p><p>Jen smirked. “Aw, how cute, Agatha and her little girlfriend walking side by side across campus.”</p><p>Wanda snorted while Agatha rolled her eyes and scowled. </p><p>“How fucking old are you, Kale? Jesus. We’re not… That.” </p><p>Jen shrugged.</p><p>“Jokes aside, I’m serious, guys. Agatha and Rio have worked together before, and it went well. Also, she’s one of the few students besides Kaplan who actually feels comfortable around Agatha. No offense,” Wanda added.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure whether to feel mortified or secretly pleased.</p><p>It was an opportunity to spend time with Rio outside of class— and the best part? It would be completely justifiable. She had no idea if Rio even had the time to take such responsibility, but something told her that if presented with the option, Rio would find a way to make it work.</p><p>She stayed quiet, pretending to weigh the idea, until Jen cut in.</p><p>“If Harkness gives me her word that this won’t interfere with Vidal’s work—”</p><p>“Why would it?” Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Agatha, whatever you have going on with Vidal, she’s one of my best students. I’m not about to force her into a situation that could negatively affect her.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced at the word ‘force’ and was about to argue when Wanda jumped in.</p><p>“Force her? Jen, come on, Vidal would jump at the chance to work with Agatha. The girl is madly in love,” Wanda laughed.</p><p>Under different circumstances, Agatha might have ignored the comment. But not this time. The way Rio had called her <em> love </em> echoed in her head, and for a brief moment, she was ready to shut the whole assistant idea down, but Jen seemed convinced.</p><p>“Go figures. All right, I’ll get the paperwork ready today and email it to both of you. Get it back to me signed by the weekend.”</p><p>Wanda noticed Agatha’s lack of enthusiasm and frowned, trying to figure out what had changed in the past few minutes. Little did she know it was all because of her big mouth.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha muttered, grabbing her hot tea and walking out of the faculty lounge without another word.</p><p>-</p><p>Great. Now, on top of the anxiety twisting in her stomach, Agatha couldn’t even cancel <em> “Lab Visit Day Where Agatha Wouldn’t Understand Shit” </em> because she had to break the big news to Rio.</p><p>Inside the Environmental building, it hit her— she had no idea where Rio’s lab was. She hadn’t asked for directions, hadn’t even thought to get the lab number.</p><p>“Fucking hell—“ Agatha groaned, debating if she should turn around, head back to her office, and pop some antacids when her phone started ringing.</p><p>“Hey gorgeous, where are you?” Rio’s voice came through as soon as Agatha picked up.</p><p>“In front of some door? I don’t know where I’m supposed to go.” </p><p>Rio laughed. “Wait for me by the main entrance. I’ll come get you.”</p><p>Agatha hung up, crossing her arms as she ignored the curious looks from a few professors passing by.</p><p>Within minutes, Rio practically materialized in front of her, grinning so wide that Agatha had to make a real effort to return at least a fraction of that enthusiasm.</p><p>“It’s actually pretty close, but I figured I’d make sure we didn’t have a lost intruder wandering through our territory,” Rio teased, tilting her head toward the correct hallway before leading the way, Agatha following just behind.</p><p>“Oh, right. Afraid I’ll find out which lab you guys use to grow your weed?”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head.</p><p>“Please, that’s in the freshman labs. Weed is way too basic for me.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at that.</p><p>Sure enough, the lab wasn’t far, and soon, they arrived. </p><p>As soon as they stepped inside, Rio shut the door behind them. Agatha blinked at the overwhelming brightness— the combination of the fluorescent lights, white walls, white floors, and white countertops made the place look, to her, like a psych ward. </p><p>She kept that thought to herself.</p><p>With an exaggerated flourish, Rio spread her arms wide. “This is where the magic happens!”</p><p>Then RIo launched into a full-on monologue, explaining every equipment she used, why she used it, how much it cost (after Agatha curiously asked), the experiments she was involved in, and what the next steps for her research were. Surprisingly, Agatha listened with genuine interest, even asking follow-up questions when Rio used overly technical terms.</p><p>“Do you have this lab all to yourself, or do you have to share it?” Agatha asked as she wandered between the counters, inspecting the arranged materials.</p><p>“Mostly just me, since this lab has some pretty specialized equipment. Every now and then, another student might need to use it, so we coordinate to make sure our experiments don’t interfere with each other.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding. When she finally made her way around the counter, she found Rio leaning against a stool, watching her.</p><p>She approached but kept a safe distance between them.</p><p>“So, I have some news…”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Yeah? Am I going to like it?”</p><p>“How would you feel about working with me during the course? As my assistant, I mean.”</p><p>Rio's face lit up. “Shit, for real? You’re not messing with me, right?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I know being a TA isn’t exactly a step forward in your program, but the opportunity came up, and I need someone—“</p><p>“I will do it, sweetheart. Fuck, yes! Does this mean I get to sit in on your meetings with her?” Rio smirked, taking a step toward Agatha.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “That’s your first question? Seriously? Not what your responsibilities will be, how many hours are required— nothing?”</p><p>Rio still had that mischievous grin on her lips and was just about to close the space between them when the lab door swung open, making them both turn their heads.</p><p>“— Stop showing off all this junk just to look smart. We get it.” Natasha said as she walked into the lab behind Yelena, ahead of a man Agatha recognized instantly. Her ex-father-in-law.</p><p>Alexei laughed, placing his hands on his daughters’ shoulders. “You used to do the same thing, kid. The only difference is, instead of lab equipment, it was—“ </p><p>He fell silent the moment he spotted Agatha. His eyes widened for a second before he let out a very loud cackle that startled both Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe it when Yelena told me! Agatha! Gods be damned!” He shoved past Natasha and Yelena, nearly knocking them aside as he made a beeline for Agatha.</p><p>Without waiting for a reaction, he wrapped her in a bear hug, as if she were a long-lost child from the neighborhood.</p><p>“Alexei, hi—“ Agatha mumbled, still caught in his embrace, her wide eyes locking onto Natasha, who looked just as stunned as she was.</p><p>“Dad, it’s not exactly polite to crush people in a hug after years of not seeing them,” Yelena teased before walking over to the counter where Rio was leaning. “Hey, Rio. Didn’t think anyone would be here at this hour— sorry if we’re interrupting.”</p><p>“You’re not," Rio replied sharply. “I wasn’t aware that was Bring Your Family to Campus Day."</p><p>Alexei finally released Agatha from the hug, and she took two steps back for good measure.</p><p>“That’s on me. Almost regretted asking Yelena to show me around— this place is huge, I can’t stop sweating," he laughed again. "What a great surprise running into you here, Agatha! Yelena said she’d try to find your office, but I honestly wasn’t sure I believed it."</p><p>Agatha forced a smile and shifted to stand beside Rio.</p><p>“Great to see you too— I’ve been working here for years now." </p><p>Alexei grinned and turned to Rio, extending a hand toward her.</p><p>“Sorry, I’m Alexei, Yelena and Natasha’s father. And you are—?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal.” She shook his hand with a polite smile, but Agatha could see the micro-expressions that gave her a clear read on Rio: irritated with high stress levels.</p><p>Natasha had been keeping her distance until now, but she suddenly stepped forward, stopping right in front of Rio and extending her hand as well.</p><p>“I don’t think we were properly introduced the first time, huh? You can call me Nat.” She waited for Rio to shake her hand, and once she did, Natasha continued, “So, you’re Agatha’s student?” Her brow furrowed slightly, as if she were genuinely curious.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes and answered before Rio could.</p><p> “Yes, she’s taking the short course I’m teaching at the university. And she’s also my assistant.”</p><p>Rio forced a polite smile at Natasha, who nodded slowly.</p><p>“That explains why you’re around Agatha every time I see her— well, <em> almost </em>every time.” Natasha smirked and fucking winked at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s expression darkened. Hoping Natasha wouldn’t bring up that damn McDonald’s encounter had already been a long shot, but considering there was absolutely no reason to mention it there, Agatha wasn’t that naive to think Natasha would just let it slide.</p><p>Rio turned her head toward Agatha in slow motion, her expression perfectly matching the atmosphere of the lab— straight out of a psych ward.</p><p>Thankfully, Yelena stepped in. “<em> Anyway </em>… I still have a lot of places to show you, so we should get going.”</p><p>Alexei, completely oblivious to the tension in the room, clapped his hands together with a loud smack and grinned. “Agatha, I’m not leaving for Iowa before we all have dinner together.” He glanced sideways at Natasha. “Since a certain someone took away my right to have the best daughter-in-law I could’ve ever asked for.” </p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes, and Yelena chuckled. Meanwhile, Rio looked like she was about to have a full-blown stroke.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line, attempting a smile, but failing miserably.</p><p>“I’m really busy, you know, but it was great seeing you, Alexei. Send my regards to Melina.”</p><p>“I’ll change your mind before I leave.” He said matter-of-factly, giving Agatha two light pats on the arm.</p><p>As he and Yelena turned to leave the lab, Natasha took a few steps closer.</p><p>“Can I talk to you for a second?”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>Natasha glared at her. “Alone, Agatha.”</p><p>With Yelena and Alexei lingering by the open door, Rio crossed her arms and said, feigning nonchalance, “We’re in a meeting right now, <em> Nat </em>. Why don’t you try later?”</p><p>Natasha took a deep breath, her gaze shifting from Agatha to Rio.</p><p>“Tell you what— your beloved professor will catch up with you soon, all right? Now, if you don’t mind…” She nodded toward the door, clearly signaling where Rio should be headed.</p><p>Before Rio could do something drastic —like rip the bolted-down stool out of the floor with sheer rage and launch it at Natasha— Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, we’ll talk in my office later, okay?”</p><p>Agatha knew that the dismissal would sting, but it was better than Natasha opening her mouth about anything that had happened at McDonald’s— whether it was the words Natasha insinuated or the card Agatha never told Rio about.</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together and shook her head. “Yeah, sure.” She said curtly, then left, with Alexei and Yelena right behind her.</p><p>“Charming student of yours, this one.” Natasha remarked, exhaling sharply.</p><p>“Listen, I haven’t forgotten your threat. I’m fucking busy this week, so if you could—“</p><p>Natasha placed her hands on Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>“Relax, hon. I just wanted to let you know that with my dad showing up, I won’t be able to give you the attention I’d like.”</p><p>Agatha exaggeratedly shook her shoulders, making Natasha remove her hands.</p><p>“Is that all?” Agatha asked, her arms crossed.</p><p>Natasha chuckled. “Yes, Agatha, that’s all. You can run from me now— but when I catch you…”</p><p>Natasha bit her lip, and Agatha rolled her eyes, getting angrier by the second.</p><p>“You really believe that, don’t you? That there’s even a remote possibility of anything happening? What are your thoughts, Natasha? That we will relive the old times? Why would I want to do that?”</p><p>“Of course I believe that. You wouldn’t be this angry just by my presence if there wasn’t something there,” Natasha smiled and stepped closer again.</p><p>Agatha held her ground.</p><p>“You fucking left me. You don’t get to tell me whether I’m right or wrong for being angry, much less the reasons for it.”</p><p>Natasha’s expression lost all its playful tone, and she sighed, reaching out to touch Agatha, but Agatha stepped back this time.</p><p>“Very well… I won’t bother you with this, Agatha, but just think about it... the way you react when you see me, maybe it’s because you still feel something for me. And seeing <em> you </em> after all these years—“</p><p>“You want to have this conversation now or not, Natasha? Because sure as hell, I’m not having this conversation twice.”</p><p>“No, not now. As I said, I want time and…” Natasha glanced around, “Privacy.” She reached out and lightly touched the length of Agatha’s hair that fell forward.</p><p>“We won’t be needing that, but whatever— I’m leaving.” Agatha took a long step away from her, feeling Natasha’s attempt to grab her by the hair where her fingers had touched. </p><p>Agatha quickly jerked her neck, pulling her hair out of Natasha's grasp.</p><p>-</p><p>Later that same day, Agatha still hadn't received a text or even seen a glimpse of Rio, even during office hours.</p><p>She was wrapping up her meeting with the students from her research project, trying her best to ignore the looks and expressions from Gulliver.</p><p>"I’ve forwarded all the papers that need to be read to your emails. It’s long and draining, so don’t leave it until the last minute. We’ll meet again in two weeks, and I expect everyone to have done their readings and respective assignments, as we discussed earlier."</p><p>The students nodded in agreement.</p><p>“You’re dismissed then.”</p><p>She stood up to gather her things as the group of students started making their way out of the room. However, Gulliver was taking her sweet time putting away her iPad.</p><p>“May I help you, Gulliver?” Agatha asked, though she didn't look up at her.</p><p>Alice seemed unsure whether to answer or not, but eventually chose to do so.</p><p>“I know it’s not my business, but I ran into her this afternoon and she was batshit crazy. She didn’t want to tell me what happened.”</p><p>“You’re right— it’s none of your business.” Agatha spoke with finality and quickly left the room to look for Rio.</p><p>-</p><p>She had called Rio’s phone five times, sent multiple texts, and even stopped by the cafeteria twice. The only reason she hadn’t gone to Rio’s department was that she didn’t want to risk running into Yelena— especially not with her father and sister in tow.</p><p>Letting out a slow breath, Agatha sat in her chair, watching the minutes tick by on her phone screen, her finger pressing down hard just to keep it lit. She’d have to leave soon if she didn’t want to be late picking up Nicky from school, and with each passing minute, her anxiety only worsened.</p><p>She reached into her bag to put away her laptop when her fingers brushed against something stiff— her nails scraped over the thick paper. The hotel business card.</p><p>With a sharp yank, she pulled it out, ready to tear it in half, when the door to her office swung open. </p><p>Agatha quickly shoved the card into the top drawer of her desk.</p><p>Rio stepped into the office slowly, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>“I don’t wanna fight, but fuck, I’m mad.” She muttered, standing stiffly in the middle of the room. She didn’t look as furious as she had back in the lab, but the tension in her face was undeniable.</p><p>Agatha stood, moving past Rio to reach the door. She locked it before turning back, closing the space between them. Lifting a hand to Rio’s face, she half expected her to pull away— but to her surprise, Rio didn’t move.</p><p>“Ask away.” Agatha still hadn’t convinced herself that she’d be completely honest about everything she and Natasha had talked about in their last two encounters. But at the very least, she could try to calm Rio down. Again.</p><p>“I’m tired of asking.” Rio said, her voice tight with frustration. “I want you to tell me there’s nothing for me to worry about. That I’m not standing here looking like a fucking idiot while you plan on getting back with her— or sleeping with her at all.”</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, her hands moving to cup Rio’s face, thumb tracing gently along her cheekbone.</p><p>“There’s absolutely zero chance of that happening.”</p><p>“Then why the hell are you making so many exceptions for her, Agatha? I know you, or at least I thought I did, and if anyone else pulled this shit with you, you’d have kicked them to the curb by now.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze. “We had a relationship, Rio. A fucking engagement. And I deserve to know what really happened back then. That doesn’t mean I want to pick up where we left off. I just want to understand. That’s it.”</p><p>“You two haven’t talked yet? She said she ran into you alone.”</p><p>Agatha kept her expression neutral, careful not to frown.</p><p>“No— we crossed paths once, but we barely spoke with each other, so.”</p><p>“I see.” </p><p>Luckily, Rio didn’t press further. She took a deep breath, stretching her neck, and Agatha let her hand fall away from her face.</p><p>“I have to pick up my kid from school.”</p><p>Rio tried not to pout and Agatha couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“Maybe you could come over on Sunday after dropping Nicky off at his dad’s?” Rio suggested, watching Agatha gather her things from the desk.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You, me, and Gulliver? Not exactly tempting. Maybe I’ll invite Kale too, just to really shake things up,” she said dryly, making Rio snort.</p><p>“Come on, sweetheart… And on Sunday it will be rainy and cold. Perfect for a Final Destination marathon.”</p><p>“Final Destination? What are you, fifteen?”</p><p>“Pleeease, Agatha—“</p><p>Agatha was already two minutes late, and without thinking, she grabbed Rio’s hand, pulling her toward the office door. “Fine, but the movie choice is still up for debate.”</p><p>-</p><p>On Saturday, Agatha was keeping the promise she had made to Nicky.</p><p>Which was why, in the middle of the afternoon, the two of them were lounging on the couch in pajamas and fuzzy socks, stretched out side by side while Nicky explained —for the fourth time— how the game worked.</p><p>“Mom, it’s not that hard!” Nicky laughed as Agatha watched her character die yet again.</p><p>She huffed and handed the Nintendo back to him.</p><p>“I’m going to make some hot cocoa. Don’t you want to play something else? Or maybe watch a movie?” she asked, getting up from the couch. </p><p>The last thing she wanted was for her son to inherit her competitive streak— or, worse, her terrible sportsmanship. So she tried to hide how fucking pissed she was over losing the same game ten times in a row. Nonetheless, a children's game. </p><p>Nicky remained glued to the screen, not responding until the battle sounds of the game finally ended. “Yeah, but I’m choosing.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and headed to the kitchen. As she started preparing the hot cocoa, her thoughts drifted to Rio. It was a strange feeling— missing talking to someone the way she did right now.</p><p>Without thinking twice, she grabbed her phone and pressed on Rio’s contact. After four rings —just as regret started creeping in— Rio picked up.</p><p>“Hey, gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Hey.”</p><p>“How are you today?” Rio’s voice sounded a little breathless, like she’d inhaled just to get the question out in one go.</p><p>“Am I interrupting?”</p><p>“No, no, I was at the court shooting some hoops— How’s your day going?”</p><p>Balancing the phone between her shoulder and ear, Agatha reached for the mugs and cocoa powder.</p><p>“Outside? It’s cold today,” she pointed out, “I’m making hot cocoa for us. Got tired of getting my ass kicked by my eight-year-old in that stupid video game.”</p><p>Rio cackled and the sound weirdly warmed Agatha’s insides.</p><p>“You’re still coming over tomorrow, right? I checked, and we can stream the entire Final Destination franchise.” Even without seeing her, Agatha was sure Rio was smirking.</p><p>“Are you seriously sticking to this? How many are there? Two, three?”</p><p>“Aren’t you cute? It’s five.”</p><p>“Baby, there’s no way you’re making me sit through five whole movies in one day. That’s not happening.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You’re gonna love them, I’m telling ya. Great movies. Absolute cinema.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop the cheesy smile forming on her lips.</p><p>“I’m hanging up now, okay? I’ll text you when I’m on my way.” Agatha said as she poured the hot milk into the mugs.</p><p>“Try getting there the earliest you can, sweetheart. I miss your pretty face.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and ended the call.</p><p>With the steaming mugs in hand, Agatha returned to the couch, where Nicky was sitting cross-legged, remote in hand, scrolling through the movie list.</p><p>She placed both mugs on the coffee table and settled beside him, pulling a blanket over them. Leaning back against the couch, she stretched her legs out to the other side.</p><p>“Nope, not Spider-Man again.” Agatha said the second she noticed Nicky hesitate when the movie’s banner popped up on the streaming platform.</p><p>“Oh mom!”</p><p>She glanced at him, and he groaned under his breath before continuing to scroll through the options. Eventually, he landed on Inside Out 2, and Agatha was relieved that he had picked something she could at least tolerate.</p><p>Halfway through the movie, Nicky, now lying with his head in her lap, eyes still on the screen, murmured a soft, almost inaudible, “Mom?”</p><p>She doubted for a second, unsure if she had actually heard him call her, but answered anyway.</p><p>“Yes, sweetie?”</p><p>“Can I ask you a question? But you have to promise you won’t get mad.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. With Nicky lying in this position, his head resting on her lap, she couldn't see his expression, making it impossible to determine how concerned she should be about what was to come.</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>He sighed. “Never mind.”</p><p>“Nicky, I promise. You can ask me anything.”</p><p>Well, <em> not literally </em>anything, but he was eight. What could he possibly ask that would throw her off?</p><p>“What does slut mean?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. She was most definitely not expecting that.</p><p>She gently took his arm, guiding him to sit up beside her. Even then, he kept his eyes on the movie.</p><p>“Where did you hear that, honey?” </p><p>“At dad’s.”</p><p>Agatha took a slow breath, keeping her voice steady. “You shouldn’t have heard that word there. It’s a very mean word that people use to insult someone, especially women.”</p><p>He still refused to look at her, even though she had fully turned toward him.</p><p>“Your dad shouldn’t be saying that. Ever. And definitely not around you. And you <em> cannot </em> repeat it, okay?”</p><p>He frowned, playing with the edge of the blanket. “It wasn’t him who said it.”</p><p>Agatha controlled herself not to lose her shit.</p><p>“Well, she shouldn’t be saying it either.”</p><p>“She said it with the f-word too, but I swear that was the first time I ever heard a bad word there. I don’t think they knew I could hear them. But it was kinda hard not to, with all the yelling.” </p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of his head, running her fingers through his hair. “I’m sorry about that, honey. Is that why you didn’t want to go over there?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“Are they fighting a lot lately?”</p><p>“Not every time, but way more than before.”</p><p>Agatha breathed through her nose and before she could offer any words of comfort, Nicky turned to her. “I don’t wanna stop going there, though, ‘cause it’s not always like that. And it’s really fun when things are okay.”</p><p>“I’ll talk to your dad, make sure he’s more careful. You shouldn’t have to hear whatever is going on between them, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded again.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a smile, and unable to resist the chance to snoop a little, she nudged him with her elbow. “But between us… who was she calling the s-word?”</p><p>“You.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>On Sunday morning, Agatha parked in front of Paul’s house, cutting the ignition with a sharp twist. The sudden motion sent her keychain clattering against the plastic, startling Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He had been silent until then, but as soon as he unbuckled his seatbelt, he scooted to the edge of his seat and placed his small hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, I shouldn’t have told you— I don’t want you guys fighting.” His voice wavered, his eyes welling up with tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha unbuckled her seatbelt and turned toward him as much as she could while still sitting. Her heart broke at the sight of him so desperately afraid of the consequences of telling her. Not just because of the words he’d overheard, but because they had been aimed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not going to fight, okay? You don’t have to worry about that. This doesn’t change anything between your dad and me, or between you and them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t in the habit of lying to Nicky, but she also wasn’t about to tell him that his honesty was about to spark a massive fight between his parents. She wasn’t Evanora— she wouldn’t traumatize her own son. At least not consciously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Nicky didn’t seem entirely convinced, but he nodded and pulled his hand back to wipe the tears pooling in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, as Agatha shut the trunk with Nicky’s backpack in hand, she spotted Paul and his wife stepping out onto the porch. Nicky immediately started walking toward them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hugged both his dad and stepmother before turning to wait for Agatha, who was marching toward them with a less-than-friendly expression. She ignored the “oh boy” Paul muttered under his breath— he knew her well enough to recognize when he was in trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Ag—“ Clare started to greet her, but Agatha cut her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, give mom a hug and go inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Clare shut her mouth, realizing that Agatha wasn’t even trying to be polite. Never a good sign.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky obeyed, wrapping his arms around her and holding on longer than usual. “Mommy, you said—“ He mumbled against her stomach, muffling the rest of his words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I love you, honey. I’ll see you next weekend, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was obvious Nicky was stalling, and all three adults noticed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Paul, ever the coward when it came to serious conversations, took a step back toward the house and placed his hands on his son’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, why don’t we talk later, huh? Nicky, maybe we could—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She can take him inside and keep him </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> entertained while we have a little chat. Right, Clare?” Agatha turned her head toward the other woman, who, much like her, had stopped pretending to play nice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The fake smile on Clare’s lips vanished as she rolled her eyes, took Nicky’s hand, and led him inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment the door shut, Agatha took a step toward Paul, finger pointed at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He, in turn, sidestepped her and backed up onto the sidewalk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mind explaining why your fucking wife is calling me a slut? In your house? With my son home?” She got straight to the point, zero patience for unnecessary context.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t going to waste time complaining about how she had to explain the meaning of the word slut to her eight-year-old or how she now had to worry about him repeating it somewhere— let alone to someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Paul’s eyes widened as he raised his hands in a defensive stance, as if Agatha were about to lunge at him. Given the fury in her eyes, it wasn’t an unreasonable assumption.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t call you that, Agatha. She wouldn’t say something like that in front of </span>
<em>
<span>our</span>
</em>
<span> son.” He emphasized </span>
<em>
<span>our</span>
</em>
<span>, correcting her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you fucking lie to me!” She yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay! Okay— maybe she said some things she shouldn’t have, but Nicky wasn’t supposed to be eavesdropping.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha still held Nicky’s backpack by the grab handle, the weight of it swinging back and forth as her hands gestured wildly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so now it’s his fault? Next time you and your wife feel like talking shit about me, maybe hand him some fucking noise-canceling headphones.” She took another step toward him. “For weeks, Nicky hasn’t wanted to come here. And when he does, he clings to me the second he gets home. You know why, Paul? Because he comes to your house and has to listen to you and your pathetic wife trash-talking his mother!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t exactly </span>
<em>
<span>yelling</span>
</em>
<span>, but her voice was noticeably louder than usual. At the words Agatha used towards Clare, Paul’s entire stance shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stopped trying to back away from her, his posture turning rigid. His eyes flickered toward the house, and for a brief second, she caught the fear in them— the fear that Clare had overheard. When he turned back to Agatha, his voice was the firmest it had been all morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch your mouth, Agatha. That’s my wife you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a sharp, venom-laced laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what exactly does being your</span>
<em>
<span> wife</span>
</em>
<span> absolve her of? You get all tough to defend her, but where was this behavior when it came to protecting your son from hearing all the shit she says about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Paul crossed his arms, opening his mouth to argue, but Agatha wasn’t done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not exactly my fault that you cheated on her with me and she didn’t have enough self-respect to divorce your ass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time since Agatha found out she was pregnant, she said out loud what she had always thought ever since Paul informed her that his marriage hadn’t ended with that little </span>
<em>
<span>misstep.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>‘Little’ was a generous word, considering Nicky was the result of Paul’s long-standing feelings for Agatha and one night of incredibly poor judgment on her part. Back then, she had known that if she had decided, somehow, to pursue a relationship with Paul, he would’ve left Clare in a heartbeat. And the worst part? Clare had probably known that too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So no, Agatha didn’t have much respect for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Paul’s expression shifted rapidly— shock, hurt, then rage. A lot of rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Self-respect?” He scoffed, his voice low and sharp. “Funny choice of words— coming from you</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span> You got dumped and couldn’t handle someone not wanting you, so you came to me just to make yourself feel better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face twisted with disgust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she believed a single word of it, but the fact that Paul, someone who had been her best friend for years, actually thought she had run to him for cheap sex out of loneliness?</span>
</p><p>
<span>During the fight, they had gradually moved closer, though there was still enough distance between them that whenever Agatha gestured, Nicky’s backpack swung through the air without actually hitting Paul.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip on the handle tightened, knuckles turning white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t be </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> stupid to honestly believe that’s what happened.” Her voice was steady, but there was a threatening edge to it. “But fine. I’m not even going to argue— it doesn’t matter anymore.” She sighed, rubbing the tip of her nose with her thumb. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to continue this conversation, not with it veering completely off track from where it was supposed to go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Apparently, Paul was still too pissed about what she had said earlier to make the effort to steer the discussion back to what actually mattered— Nicky. His lips curled into a mocking smile, and before a single word even left his mouth, Agatha’s stomach twisted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She already knew. Whatever came next was going to hit fast and hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s a stable marriage in my house, Agatha. What about yours? Maybe Nicky didn’t even need to hear Clare calling a slut. He’d figure it out soon enough— after seeing god knows how many whores sneaking out of your bedroom in the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s blood pressure spiked so violently she thought she might have to sit down right there on the sidewalk. She must not have done a great job hiding the impact his words had on her, because Paul’s smirk vanished in an instant, replaced by something that almost looked like guilt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mouth opened before her brain had even caught up, but when she spoke, her voice came out unwavering, bordering on a scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How fucking dare you?! Is this all just bitterness from being rejected years ago? Are you really as pitiful as your wife—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Paul tried to cut Agatha off, stepping closer with his hand reaching out for her arm, an apology already forming on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the worst decision he could’ve made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s backpack came flying at him, smashing into his ribs with a sickening thud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of books and binders turned it into a weapon, knocking the breath from his lungs as he stumbled back. The straps tangled around his arm for a split second before the backpack crashed to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was breathing heavily, her face still twisted in anger as her eyes bore into Paul, who looked genuinely shaken by how things had escalated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the first time an argument between them had diverged toward something this intense. Usually, one of them would unilaterally decide to stop, letting the fight dissolve into silence, only to be resumed days or weeks later. But not this time— not with words deliberately aimed to wound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I’m sorry, I didn’t—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Save it.” Her voice was sharp, almost spat out. “If you ever talk shit with Nicky in that house again, if you try to hide things from me, or —god help me, Paul— if you try to get him to lie to me, I </span>
<em>
<span>swear</span>
</em>
<span> I’ll take you to court. And you and I both know who’s winning that fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair, shoving it back, then turned on her heel and stormed toward her car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had no idea how she got there or how long it had taken. Nevertheless, she was standing outside Rio’s building, finger pressing into the intercom button, rain drizzling over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At some point during the drive, her fight with Paul had settled into the back of her mind like a dull, persistent ache. Nicky’s face flashed in and out of focus, gnawing at her. She didn’t know if he had heard the worst parts, if her voice had cut through the walls and reached him. The thought made her stomach twist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, somehow, she had ended up there, rain soaking into her clothes, as if her body had moved on its own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The gate buzzed open, and she made her way up the stairs instinctively. Before she could even knock, the apartment door swung open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood there, barefoot, wearing low-waisted sweatpants and an oversized Westview University hoodie. Her smile lasted only a second before her gaze flickered over Agatha, taking in her state.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what happened?” Rio asked and stepped aside, letting Agatha into the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your face tells me otherwise. What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, setting her purse down on the kitchen counter. She leaned back, pressing her palms against her face, covering her eyes. The concern in Rio’s voice was too much— too soft, too careful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed quiet for a while, and Rio didn’t push. She kept her distance but stayed watching, waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The chill from the rain was starting to settle deep into Agatha’s skin. Her damp clothes clung uncomfortably to her body, the old building’s weak heating doing nothing to help. A shiver ran up her spine, and she instinctively rubbed her arms for warmth, only making the fabric stick to her even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need a hot shower. And dry clothes." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, taking Agatha’s hand and leading her to the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alone, Agatha stripped out of her clothes and was turning on the shower when Rio knocked on the door. She waited for Agatha to answer and entered with clothes similar to the ones she was wearing in hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried, really tried, not to let her gaze wander Agatha’s naked body, but she failed spectacularly. On any other day, Agatha would’ve called her out on it, but not today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she stepped under the warm spray of water, letting the heat sink into her bones. To her surprise, Rio didn’t leave. She leaned against the wall, arms crossed, facing Agatha, patient. Waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Agatha spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the hot water washed over her, Agatha told Rio everything— every detail, from Nicky’s reluctance to the moment she drove away from Paul’s house. She laid it all out, including the tangled history between her and Paul, the affair, and even the thrown backpack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I fucking hate him.” Those were the first words out of Rio’s mouth once they were settled on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The living room was dim, lit only by the soft glow of the TV. The curtains were drawn, cocooning them in a warmth Agatha desperately needed. But what truly grounded her wasn’t the cozy atmosphere. It was the scent of Rio clinging to the clothes she wore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her damp hair clung to the back of the couch, and she knew she'd regret it later when it dried in a tangled mess. But for now, she didn’t care. She was content, curled up with her legs tucked beneath her, while Rio hovered close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m tired of talking about this.” Agatha confessed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had been on edge from the moment she found out Agatha’s name was being trashed in Paul’s house, and her agitation only worsened as the story unfolded. She looked about two seconds away from grabbing her car keys and knocking on Paul and Clare’s door with a wooden bat in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you tell me where they live, I could give them a little scare. Nothing too crazy, just enough to keep them on their toes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted at the absurdity of it, assuming Rio was just trying to make her laugh. But the mischievous glint in Rio’s eyes made her second-guess that assumption.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re insane, you know that?” Agatha murmured, a small smile finally tugging at her lips. She reached for Rio’s hand and gently pulled her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stretched her legs out, settling her head against the armrest of the couch, Rio adjusted herself beside her, lying on her side with her back to the television, fully facing Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Propped up on one elbow, Rio rested her head in her hand, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s. Neither of them looked away— not until they both instinctively closed the distance at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s other arm draped over Agatha, her fingers gently caressing her face as their kiss remained delicate, almost fragile. When Rio deepened it, Agatha welcomed her, parting her lips to let her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike the other times, there was no urgency— just tenderness. It was unhurried, intentional. Rio’s touch remained soft against Agatha’s cheek, while Agatha’s fingers played with the nape of Rio’s neck, threading through her hair or pressing just enough to keep her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled away, each with a lazy smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready for some binge-watching?” Rio asked impishly, raising her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes dramatically, tilting her head back with an exaggerated groan. "God, nooo—“ she dragged out, earning an amused laugh from Rio, who got up to grab the remote.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio left Agatha in charge of the TV while she went to the kitchen, making an absurd amount of popcorn and returning with two bottles of Diet Pepsi.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled onto the couch, facing the TV, as close as possible— not by Agatha’s choice, but because Rio was practically in her lap. Surprisingly, Agatha didn’t mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched the first movie in near silence, the only sounds being the crunch of popcorn and Agatha’s occasional remarks about scenes she found too over-the-top— comments Rio simply shrugged off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the middle of the second movie, Agatha was growing restless. The popcorn was gone, leaving her with only one distraction: Rio, who was watching the screen like it was her first time seeing the movie. Hell, it </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha’s first time, and she was bored out of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still side by side, Agatha placed her palm on Rio’s thigh— nothing. No reaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even blink. Agatha huffed quietly and slid her hand up, fingers grazing Rio’s hip bone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got a very small reaction. Rio froze, her body tensing, and that was it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyed and aroused —entirely her own fault— Agatha turned her head and brushed her nose along Rio’s jaw. That did it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Should I be concerned that you’re horny during this scene?” Rio asked, amusement laced in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to the TV, and sure enough, the scene unfolding was peak suspense— one of the main characters undergoing a root canal in a dentist's office just as a pigeon crashed through the waiting room window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed, pulling away from Rio, who was also chuckling and shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the laughter died down, Agatha refocused on the movie— only to be caught off guard by Rio, who clearly had other plans. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without a word, Rio got up from the couch and grabbed Agatha by the front of her shirt. Before Agatha could even make a sound, Rio was already tugging her toward the bedroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After an orgasm each— both cumming faster than either would like to admit— they returned to the living room, dressed again, their hair slightly disheveled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Agatha dropped onto the couch and looked at the TV, she let out a sound of disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you serious? You actually paused it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio merely laughed, settling in beside her, just as close as before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course I did. I wouldn’t want you to miss a single thing, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled— the bliss of the orgasm, courtesy of Rio’s skilled tongue, doing wonders for her mood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gruesome deaths of the third movie were already unfolding when Agatha adjusted herself on the couch. Rio had an arm wrapped over her shoulders, and Agatha was lying with her head resting against Rio’s chest. So far, this was her favorite movie of the three, and she was so engrossed in the screen that she didn’t even notice Alice had entered the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women jumped when Alice spoke from somewhere in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Final Destination? Really?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to lift her head from Rio’s chest, but Rio’s hand —previously running through her hair— firmly kept her in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are awesome movies, thank you very much.” Rio responded, eyes still glued to the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice walked over to the TV, stopping to watch the scene of the out-of-control truck, which would undoubtedly lead to yet another character's death. When the death actually happened, she turned toward the couch, her gaze falling on Agatha and Rio, who were in a far more intimate and affectionate position than Alice had ever seen before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha noticed Gulliver’s eyes on her and stared back, silently daring her to say something. Alice swallowed her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanna watch with us? I’m ordering some pizza soon.” Rio commented casually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nah, I just came to grab my iPad. I’m heading back to Will’s place. We’re working on the first assignment for a professor who has no mercy on students and is already killing us after one class.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was obvious she was talking about Agatha, who kept a neutral expression, still focused on the TV. Rio, on the other hand, chuckled and placed a kiss on the top of Agatha’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guys worry too much.” Rio said loudly as Alice went to get the iPad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Alice returned, she positioned herself in the same spot as before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Easy for you to say when you have the said professor with you all the time.” Alice said in a playful tone, making Rio laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sweetheart, tell her you won’t help me, and that when I end up being the best student in the class, it will be all because of my own merit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head from Rio’s chest and looked at her, then shifted her gaze to Alice. Several retorts ran through her mind, but she decided on the one that would improve her mood the most.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure thing, baby. All your A’s will be solely acquired by your own knowledge and lack of study with your peers.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth fell open in shock and betrayal— while Alice burst into laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Rio exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay lovebirds, I’m out. Enjoy all the bloody corpses.” Alice didn't wait for any farewell words and left the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to Agatha, who still had a wicked grin on her lips, and literally kissed the smile off of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After stuffing themselves with vegetarian pizza, they were lying on the couch, Agatha hugging Rio from behind, both facing the television. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At some point during the fourth movie, Agatha drifted off to sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was still in a deep sleep, and not even Rio's movements as she left Agatha's embrace to get off the couch were enough to wake her. The movie had been paused, and the comfort of the couch and the blanket spread over Agatha kept her sleeping soundly, despite the murmurs from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod— what is she doing here?!” William asked, his voice bordering on desperation and utter shock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Rio both shushed him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, what the fuck? You knew we were here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you guys had already left! You always sleep at her place, how on earth was I supposed to know she'd still be here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could've asked! Texted, called, anything—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women realized at the same time that Will was no longer in the kitchen, but had instead approached the couch to get a closer look to confirm if it was indeed Agatha Harkness sleeping there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio quickly rushed to yank him away, and the scuffling was enough to stir Agatha, her eyes snapping open. The first thing she saw were Will’s wide eyes, locked onto her, as Rio tugged at his shirt to pull him away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She jolted, startled, sitting up on the couch, still disoriented.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“What the hell—“ She muttered, pulling the blanket around her as if the fabric could protect her from the chaos unfolding in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As her senses returned and the situation fully sank in, Rio had managed to drag Will out of the living room, shoving him into Alice’s bedroom with hurried whispers and hushed reprimands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio came back, Agatha was still sitting on the couch, furious. She had known from the start that nothing good would come from staying at Rio’s apartment. But, as always, when it came to Rio, she had caved— and now she was paying the price, waking up to fucking Kaplan staring at her like she was some kind of zoo animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Swe—“ </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t,” Agatha cut her off, her voice sharp. “I’m going home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed off the couch, determined to leave, only for Rio to step in front of her, blocking her way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I’m not joking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we talk in my bedroom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “I told you I’m leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Agatha, you’re not. And if you try, I swear to god I’ll tie myself to your windshield.” Rio’s voice was firm, but the corners of her lips twitched, betraying the hint of a smile. “Please, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath and nodded, finally free to stand up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She followed Rio into the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With the door shut behind them, Agatha turned to find Rio standing at the foot of the bed. Before Rio could offer a lame excuse or try to defuse the tension with a stupid joke, Agatha crossed her arms, her posture defensive, and got straight to the point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I had a rough morning and I’m not in the mood. I’m pissed. I knew something like this would happen. It was only a matter of time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since Agatha showed no signs of moving closer, Rio took the initiative, closing the distance between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it really the worst thing in the world that Will knows about us? Come on, Agatha. He’s not an idiot. I attended literally one class and he’s seen me going in and out of your office more times than any other student at that university.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, her fingers tightening around the sweater. Rio didn’t miss the movement. She placed her hands over Agatha’s restless fingers, trying to coax her into uncrossing her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t work at first, but soon enough, Agatha let her arms fall, and Rio took the opportunity to slide her hands onto her waist. Agatha still remained silent, unwilling to admit that Rio had a point. A very logical one, at that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough with the bad temper, sweetheart. You don’t need it, and you know that. If you would rather not sleep here, fine by me. But in that case, I’m sleeping in your bed, even if I have to handcuff myself to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s tone was playful, an attempt to lighten Agatha’s mood. However, Agatha’s expression was still tight, her silence unusual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she clicked her tongue. “I can’t exactly demand discretion from him, not in my position. Can you talk to him? Make sure he keeps that gossiping mouth of his shut?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>William was the most chatty and gossipy person Agatha knew, a dangerous combination for someone she now had no choice but to trust with a secret that absolutely couldn’t get out. Not with Rio being her student. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, she didn’t have much of a choice now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers pressed into Agatha’s skin, holding her still. “You got it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not the most reassuring words, but Agatha didn’t have time to reinforce her request, not when Rio was looking at her with those unfairly big, brown eyes, making her defenses crumble, one by one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands slid up, wrapping around Agatha, pulling her in. Agatha, in turn, put her arms over Rio’s shoulders. That was all the encouragement Rio needed to flash a beautiful smile, her gap on full display— the final blow to Agatha’s last, barely-standing wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she had put much effort into keeping it up in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was the one who initiated the kiss, and Rio hummed in appreciation when she deepened it just seconds after their lips met. Agatha set the pace, and Rio was more than happy to follow, letting her have control over something, anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly to shift the angle of the kiss when they heard a knock on the door, the very one they were almost pressed against.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So hey, I’m leaving, I’m so sorry—“ William murmured from the other side. “I’ll see you tomorrow! Bye, Rio and…” He hesitated, his voice laced with nervousness. Even without seeing him, Agatha was sure he was scratching the back of his neck, the way he always did when he was tense. “Bye, Agatha, uh— just so you know, I’m so very happy— OUCH!” Will yelled after a loud slap echoed down the hallway and into Rio’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted and reached for the doorknob, but before she could turn it, Agatha’s hand landed over hers, stopping her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you do that? That hurt!” Will whined from the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, Will, shut the hell up and get out already!” Alice muttered, and from the sound of footsteps against the floor, she wasn’t being particularly gentle about pushing him out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Moments later, a door opened and shut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women let out a breath before turning back to face each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you stay over, I </span>
<em>
<span>promise</span>
</em>
<span> I’ll wake up super early with you tomorrow so we can swing by your place before heading to campus. Breakfast included— the whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and kissed her, a quick, smacking peck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My answer depends entirely on how many times I’ll have to try dragging you out of bed in the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, pulling away so they could get ready for the night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With their teeth brushed and phones charging on the nightstands, Agatha yawned as she followed Rio back into the bedroom. She nearly bumped into her when Rio suddenly stopped in the middle of the room and started stripping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her gaze obviously dropping to Rio’s naked ass. After discarding the last piece of clothing, Rio casually walked over to her side of the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to freeze your tits off.” Agatha stated matter-of-factly as she sat on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’m not.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a shame. I really like them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her with anticipation while Agatha scrolled through her phone, making sure she hadn’t missed anything important in the past few hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Setting the phone back on the nightstand, Agatha pulled the covers up to slip under them— only to pause. There was an unusual resistance, like she had to use more force than normal. And the weight pressing down on her? Way off. Not to mention the sudden heat. It was like stepping into a damn furnace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, sweetheart?” Rio’s voice dripped with mischief, and the soft glow of the bedside lamp highlighted the smirk playing on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s happening?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a long laugh and reached out of bed. Agatha sat up to get a better look at what Rio was trying to show her, and there it was— a cord plugged into both the blanket and the wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>An electric blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced. It wasn’t because of her age or anything, but she had a hard time trusting a peaceful night’s sleep under a material that involved both fabric and electricity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you have a </span>
<em>
<span>normal</span>
</em>
<span> blanket?” she asked, making Rio pout immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why? I got this for you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed through her nose like the answer was obvious. To Agatha, it definitely wasn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The heating in this apartment sucks, and you always get cold during the night— I’ve noticed. I got this so you wouldn’t have to sleep in, like, a hundred layers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked a few times, caught off guard and a little bewildered by the fact that Rio had not only thought about her comfort but had actively gone out of her way to make sure she’d be warm whenever she slept over. For a moment, Agatha felt bad for how much she’d considered going home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was speechless with the gesture and Rio, as always the most empathetic of the two, didn’t let the silence stretch into anything awkward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And obviously, this also greatly increases my chances of having you naked in my bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the tension dissolving, her body sinking into the mattress as she finally let herself relax. Rio was still watching her, only her head peeking out from under the covers, hair spread over the pillow, and those fucking eyes locked on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up, and in a few quick movements, stripped out of her clothes before slipping under the blanket. Rio’s smile was so wide it was honestly a miracle her jaw didn’t ache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God help me not to burn to death in my sleep.” Agatha muttered, just loud enough for Rio to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and wrapped both an arm and a leg over her, tucking her face against Agatha’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lazily traced her fingers along the length of Rio’s arm until the pull of sleep became too hard to resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with Rio practically sprawled over her, Agatha rolled onto her side. In her sleep, Rio instinctively pulled her closer until their bodies were pressed together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the ghost of a kiss on her shoulder before finally drifting off.</span>

<p>“You really believe it’s a good idea to have a student from the course as your assistant? I mean, conflict of interest and all…” Carol said, bringing her absurdly oversized cup of coffee to her lips, as if Rio wasn’t <em> literally </em> sitting right there across from the couch in Agatha’s office.</p><p>On the couch, Carol sat with perfect posture, legs crossed, iPad in hand, while Agatha, also on the couch, had her laptop balanced on her lap, skimming through the key points for her next class.</p><p>Agatha looked up first at Rio, who was staring at Dr. Danvers with a hostile expression. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, brows slightly furrowed— barely holding herself back from not making this her first and last day as Agatha’s assistant.</p><p>"I’m certain she’ll handle the position appropriately, won’t you, Ms. Vidal?" Agatha said, her voice deliberately more melodic on Rio’s last name, a clear reminder that this was not the kind of situation where Agatha could defend her if she decided to do something like throwing that chair at Dr. Danvers.</p><p>“Of course. I’m just here to make Professor Harkness’ life easier. That’s it.” Rio replied, stretching her lips into a smile so forced that Agatha had to hold back a laugh.</p><p>She pretended to cough and turned her attention back to Carol, who barely spared Rio a glance.</p><p>The rest of the meeting was just as… <em> friendly. </em></p><p>Dr. Danvers acted like she was way above Rio, touched Agatha’s arm more times than necessary, and by the time Carol finally left the office, Rio looked about two seconds away from running in circles while spontaneously combusting.</p><p>"Already regretting it?" Agatha asked as she closed her laptop on the desk.</p><p>Rio was still sitting in the same chair, her face twisted in disgust and annoyance. Arms crossed, lips pursed into a perfect pout. Once again, Agatha had to look away to keep from laughing right in her face.</p><p>Before Rio could put together a response —which would probably come out as a bark or something equally ridiculous— William walked into the office, two folders in hand.</p><p>He stopped dead in his tracks when he realized Agatha wasn’t alone.</p><p>“Oh—hey, uhm—“ His eyes darted between the two women, his cheeks instantly turning a shade of red.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the dramatics and stood up behind her desk.</p><p>“You were supposed to have this delivered to me by Friday, William.”</p><p>“I know, I know. I’m sorry, it wasn't here, after all. I took it home last semester and only remembered over the weekend. Really sorry about that.” he said, flustered, as he handed over the material.</p><p>She nodded, already focused on sorting through the ever-growing pile of papers and folders on her desk. Meanwhile, Will turned his attention to Rio, who was still in place like a statue. He raised an eyebrow and started walking toward her.</p><p>“Careful, she might bite.” Agatha quipped without looking up, earning a sharp glare from Rio.</p><p>Will let out a nervous laugh but decided not to risk his safety, stopping in the middle of the office between them.</p><p>“Anyway… Everything set for tomorrow night? Eddie and I are picking you guys up.” </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, oblivious to whatever plans Rio had made. Not that they had anything officially scheduled, but considering Rio always wanted to sleep at her house (or vice versa, given recent events) whenever Nicky was at his dad’s… But she remained quiet.</p><p>“Yep,” was Rio’s only response.</p><p>“Okay, uhm— Have a good day!” Will murmured before slipping out and closing the door behind him.</p><p>Agatha carried on with her work as usual. She knew there was no use in forcing or rushing Rio’s mood back to normal— she just had to let it run its course. But patience wasn’t exactly her strong suit, and with each passing minute, she closed a folder with more force than the last.</p><p>Finally, Rio stood up and walked over, stopping on the other side of the desk.</p><p>“So, I may have plans tomorrow night.” </p><p>“Don’t you have class on Wednesday?” Fuck she sounded old. And a mother. </p><p>Agatha grimaced at her own words.</p><p>Rio looked confused for a second before letting out a quiet laugh through her nose. “Sweetheart, campus is closed on Wednesday.”</p><p>Agatha was caught slightly off guard —definitely not her most attentive professor moment— and grabbed her phone to check the calendar.</p><p>Sure enough, it was that time of the semester when the university canceled classes in honor of some historical Westview event that, honestly, Agatha couldn’t even remember anymore.</p><p>“Fuck, I completely forgot.” She muttered, tossing her phone back onto the desk as her brain flooded with memories tied to the date. How Wanda, without fail, dragged her to a bar every year with a handful of friends and colleagues. How she never managed to escape. And how, by the fourth year, she had finally learned to tolerate it.</p><p>“Is that okay with you? I tried to get out of it, but Alice is feeling a bit neglected since I haven’t gone out with her in a while—“</p><p>Ever since she met Agatha, she’d hinted at it, but didn’t say it out loud.</p><p>“Yes, of course. As long as Gulliver doesn’t call me in the middle of the night because you’re high and crying calling for me.” </p><p>“I wasn’t crying!”</p><p>Agatha laughed, and soon Rio was laughing too.</p><p>“I’m going out with Wanda and some folks— a gathering that happens every year,” Agatha said, zipping up her bag. “But seriously, Rio, take it easy. I meant it when I said that was the first and last time you put me in that position.”</p><p>“I promise. Just don’t promise I won’t ditch all those idiots early to sneak off to your house.” Rio said with a smile as she walked around the desk.</p><p>Agatha smiled as Rio pressed her against the wall for a PG-13 make-out session before they both had to get on with their day.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha was wearing a casual outfit— a black tank top underneath a loose-fitting black blazer and blue straight-leg jeans. Her white sneaker tapped against the leg of the table as she listened to multiple conversations happening at once around the table, which, besides her, included Wanda, Jen, Carol, Ralph, and several other professors whose names she wasn’t entirely sure of.</p><p>“So, Agatha, have you given any thought to opening a new course in the environmental department next year?”</p><p>Agatha set her beer down on the table and looked at Ralph, who was shifting the topic of his previous conversation with Carol over to her.</p><p>“Not really, no. I don’t think there’s a necessity for that. Environmental Law is Wanda’s expertise, not mine.”</p><p>“Dr. Danvers here will be joining us next semester, maybe you two could offer the course again. I’m sure plenty of students wanted to take it but couldn’t get in.”</p><p>Agatha merely nodded, masking her surprise upon hearing that Carol had, in fact, pulled some strings and would be joining the university’s staff soon.</p><p>“Oh, I would love that. I’m teaching my first class tomorrow. It’s hard to compete against Agatha, but…” Carol crossed her fingers for luck, provoking a smile from both Agatha and Ralph.</p><p>“You’ll do just fine—“ She had no intention of inflating Carol’s ego any further, but she was interrupted before she could finish.</p><p>“You manage so many things at once! I still don’t get why you think you need that student. What’s her name again? River? Rita?”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, exhaling slowly through her nose to stop a scowl from forming on her face. Of course, Carol wouldn’t remember Rio’s name— she had put in a lot of effort to ignore her during the weekly meeting. And it wasn’t even the first time they’ve met.</p><p>“Rio Vidal.” Agatha said, her voice even, though she could already feel the shift from two women at the table.</p><p>She caught Wanda and Jen looking at her. Jen seemed surprised to hear Rio’s name come up so randomly— well, randomly to her, since she hadn’t been paying enough attention to the conversation. Wanda, on the other hand, arched an eyebrow, a silent reminder for Agatha to tread carefully.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and shifted her gaze back to Carol.</p><p>“Right—“</p><p>“She's a great student— hardworking, smart. I can see why you picked her as an assistant. Solid choice," Ralph said casually, taking a sip of his beer, completely unaware of the way Agatha’s stomach twisted and her face soured.</p><p>She opened her mouth, ready to steer the conversation anywhere else —really, anywhere— but Ralph suddenly lifted his beer toward the bar’s entrance.</p><p>“Oh, isn’t that her? With… Holy crap, a whole damn pack of students?” </p><p>Agatha whipped around so fast the table shook, drawing the attention of everyone else in their group towards the bar’s entrance.</p><p>Rio had just walked in, surrounded by what looked like fifty students.</p><p>Okay, maybe twelve. But they seemed to multiply as they moved, flooding into the bar like they belonged there. Agatha immediately recognized some of them— Will, Eddie, Alice, Yelena. That core group of five made a beeline for the bar.</p><p>“Oh fuck, we’re screwed.” Jen said, and the whole table laughed, except Agatha.</p><p>In fact, she barely heard the laughter at the table. Her eyes were glued to Rio, who was leaning against the bar, laughing at something Alice had said. Rio looked effortlessly hot, wearing a black long-sleeve crop top with a slightly loose fit with high-waisted blue jeans. Every time Rio leaned against the bar, her top rode up just enough to expose a sliver of her stomach.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to look away, grabbing her beer and downing what was left in long gulps.</p><p>Fuck, there was no way she was walking up to that bar to get another one. Relief washed over her when Wanda stood up, offering to grab drinks for the group.</p><p>Agatha refocused on the conversation with Ralph and Carol, the three of them caught up in a discussion about upcoming university projects. That lasted all of ten minutes before Wanda returned— not alone, but with Rio’s group of five and a few extra students who looked way too excited to see their professors outside of a classroom.</p><p>Greetings were exchanged between students and faculty, including Agatha, who kept hers minimal, a murmured “hey” here and a polite nod there.</p><p>“Wanda, you left ten minutes ago to grab beers and came back with just your own? Seriously?” Jen complained, already shifting like she was about to get up before Wanda stopped her.</p><p>“Guys.” Wanda said with a knowing smile.</p><p>Like magic, each student held up an extra beer alongside their own. In perfect sync, they leaned in, setting bottles in front of every professor at the table. The whole thing was so well-rehearsed it was almost impressive.</p><p>It was Rio who placed the beer in front of Agatha, leaning closer to her —much closer than any other student with any other teacher— and placing the bottle on the table. </p><p>“Hey, you.” Rio whispered in Agatha’s ear before pulling away.</p><p>Agatha felt all the hairs on her arms stand on end and a familiar rush of thrill ran up her spine as laughter and playful banter broke out, and the professors sipped their beers while the students laughed alongside them.</p><p>“As much as I appreciate not having to go to the bar anymore, I’m pretty sure it’s not exactly ethical for us to use them as our personal staff.” Ralph said, conveniently ignoring the fact that the students were still gathered around the table.</p><p>“Wait, Professor Maximoff said that if we served you, you’d play against us.”</p><p>The professors all turned to Wanda, who simply shrugged, as if it were a small price to pay.</p><p>“Play what?” Agatha asked, deliberately ignoring Rio’s unwavering gaze in her direction. The woman barely even blinked.</p><p>“Darts, pool, arcade— we’ve got teams for all of them.”</p><p>While the students and teachers debated how to split into teams, Agatha had already finished the beer Rio got her and was nearly done with another one when Wanda discreetly pulled her out of earshot.</p><p>“Did you come straight from the desert or something? Geez, Agatha.” Wanda said, nodding toward the nearly empty beer in Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Considering this dumb competition was your brilliant idea, <em> I </em> should be the one worrying about your alcohol intake."</p><p>“Come on, it’ll be fun—“ Wanda started, but Jen cut in, calling them over to pick a game.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t particularly good at any of the options, so she went with pool, hoping some muscle memory from her college days would kick in.</p><p>Dr. Danvers chose to be her partner, casually mentioning that she still had a habit of playing at local bars back in Salem. No one questioned it, and Agatha soon found herself leaning against the pool table next to Carol while the students debated who would go up against them.</p><p>“I’m in.” Rio said, only to be immediately shut down by some of the students.</p><p>“Are you crazy? You rule at darts. You're playing a one-on-one match— same as Yelena.” Will said, pointing toward where they were supposed to go.</p><p>“Someone else can do it. I'm playing pool.” Rio insisted.</p><p>“Rio, no offense, but I’m way better at pool than you. I’m teaming up with Alice. Move—”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, blocking Will from grabbing a cue.</p><p>“No. I'm playing pool with Alice. Go with Yelena before I shove this stick so far up your ass you’ll be tasting wood until finals.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and covered it up with a sip of her beer, finishing it off.</p><p>While the students were still arguing over who would play what, Agatha excused herself to grab another beer at the bar.</p><p>She had barely reached the counter when Rio appeared beside her, lips curled into a smirk.</p><p>“I’m supposed to be the one getting that for you.” Rio said, raising a hand to get the bartender’s attention as he handled orders from a group at the other end of the counter.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze fixed straight ahead on the shelves of liquor.</p><p>“That’s stupid. You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>“But I want to.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head just a few inches toward Rio, who was leaning against the bar— deliberately showing more skin than necessary.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be at a party?”</p><p>“Yeah, but it was boring as fuck and some of us decided to come here instead. Great call, if you ask me. Though if I had known you’d be here, I would’ve bailed on that party before even showing up."</p><p>Agatha smiled, and just as she did, the bartender finally made his way over. With beers in hand, the two headed back to the pool table, where Carol and Alice were just waiting for them to start.</p><p>The game began as expected. Everyone chalked their cue tips— Alice doing so as if it were an exact science, her fingers nearly white from the sheer number of times she repeated the motion before every shot.</p><p>Carol seemed just as competitive as Agatha, and soon the two were deep in conversation —standing closer than Rio would have liked— discussing strategies, deciding who would focus on scoring and who would play defensively.</p><p>“You weren’t kidding when you said you play in Salem," Agatha remarked as Carol rolled yet another ball into the pocket.</p><p>The blonde chuckled, circling around the table to make way for Alice, who was up next. Purposefully, she positioned herself right behind Agatha to watch Alice take her shot.</p><p>Rio was keeping her cool, but watching Carol practically press up against Agatha at the pool table was too much.</p><p>“When are you going back to your town again?" Rio asked from the other side of the table, cue stick pointed straight at Carol.</p><p>Agatha frowned upon seeing the cue raised mid-air over the table, while Alice, visibly annoyed by the interruption, pushed Rio’s cue away, prompting her to pull it back to her side.</p><p>Carol merely lifted her eyes toward Rio.</p><p>“To pick up my things? After the course is over." She shrugged, her focus still on Alice, who was carefully positioning her index finger on top of the stick.</p><p>Rio huffed, frustrated that all three women were more invested in the game than in whatever she was trying to stir up. With a light stroke, Alice rolled a ball into the pocket.</p><p>“She’s good.” Agatha remarked, shifting her weight onto her cue as she studied the layout of the balls, deciding on her next move.</p><p>Carol, still behind her, touched her chin on Agatha’s shoulder. “Don’t worry darling, we’re still winning this.” </p><p>Agatha, who had been fully focused on the pool table, was caught off guard by the warm breath against her skin. She immediately pulled away, narrowing her eyes at Carol, who only smirked in response.</p><p>Rio let out a sharp exhale —something between a scoff and a snort laced with indignation— then balanced her cue stick next to the table before spinning on her heels and walking away.</p><p>Carol opened her mouth to ask where the hell she was going, considering they were in the middle of a game, but Alice spoke first. “She had to use the bathroom,” she said, her expression less than friendly as she glanced at Agatha.</p><p>It was obvious Alice had been watching the interaction too— maybe not as intently as Rio, but enough to understand why her best friend had left so abruptly.</p><p>“Well, might as well grab a drink. Want one too, Aggie?" Carol asked. When Agatha declined, she headed toward the bar.</p><p>Alice knew better than to say some dumb shit to Agatha, so when Agatha looked at her, hands raised in a ‘well?<em> ’ </em> gesture, Alice simply nodded toward the bar’s exit.</p><p>Outside, Rio was leaning against the wall, smoking a joint.</p><p>“Pretty sure walking out in the middle of a pool game isn’t in the rulebook.” Agatha said playfully, trying to keep things light.</p><p>Rio, however, kept her gaze fixed straight ahead, staring at nothing in particular on the other side of the street, giving no sign she even acknowledged Agatha’s presence.</p><p>“Rio, are we doing this? Again?” </p><p>Agatha let out an irritated breath and stepped in front of Rio, forcing her to look at her.</p><p>Of all the ways Rio acted when she was jealous, this was the one that surprised Agatha the most.</p><p>With the joint in her right hand, Rio grabbed Agatha by the back of her head with her left and kissed her— hard. Their mouths collided with force, Rio pulling her in like she was starving.<br/>Agatha barely had time to react before Rio’s tongue was already in her mouth, sliding in, tangling with hers in a way that sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>For a few seconds, Agatha melted into the kiss— until, miraculously, her alcohol-foggy brain kicked in, and she pulled away, resisting every instinct screaming at her to pin Rio against that wall.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m all good now. Let’s go.” Rio said, voice slightly hoarse but resolute as she put out the joint.</p><p>Agatha felt dizzy from the whiplash, moving only when Rio grabbed her hand. But it didn’t stop there, because the moment Agatha turned to head back inside, Rio let her hand slide from Agatha’s to her arm, down to her lower back, and then gave her ass a squeeze.</p><p>Agatha swatted her hand in retaliation, and the two headed back to the game.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha and Carol won the game.</p><p>In the other games, the students fared far better than the teachers, and the bar quickly became a vibrant gathering, with students and professors speaking and laughing together.</p><p>Agatha, however, remained a bit more reserved, mostly engaged in conversations with Wanda and Ralph. Between topics, she excused herself to head to the bar— not that she actually planned on drinking anything. She was already reaching that point where her body felt light, and she knew that anything beyond this point would be a very dangerous territory.</p><p>She just wanted a few minutes of silence.</p><p>Of course, now that she was alone for the first time in hours, Yelena took the opportunity to slide onto the stool next to her at the bar, which was gradually emptying out as the night wore on.</p><p>“Hey.” Yelena smiled, tipping her empty beer bottle in the bartender’s direction.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Are we cool?” </p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Yes. Why are you asking?”</p><p>“I know Nat is being a pain in your ass, but that has nothing to do with me. I really missed you. You’re like an older sister to me.” </p><p>“How drunk are you, Yelena?”</p><p>Yelena laughed, throwing her arms open before lunging forward, wrapping Agatha in a heavy, clumsy hug.</p><p>Agatha hugged her back —not that she had much of a choice— while Yelena mumbled into her hair, "Very, but I still meant what I said."</p><p>Agatha hummed in response and managed to guide Yelena back onto her seat. </p><p>Yelena flashed a bright, satisfied smile before wandering off, beer in hand.</p><p>“My goodness, Agatha, how many students you’re scoring?” Jen asked, slurring her words through laughter when Agatha returned from the counter after witnessing the hug between Agatha and Yelena.</p><p>Jen was standing next to Wanda, while Rio, Alice, Will, and Eddy were deep in conversation nearby— close enough that all four of them turned their heads toward the three professors, the words catching their attention immediately.</p><p><em> It can’t get worse. </em> That was the thought Agatha clung to as she silently prayed for the ground to open up and swallow her whole.</p><p>Apparently, it could.</p><p>“Oh, please, as if Agatha would bang a student when she has so many better options around!” Carol joked, laughing loudly— the only sound stopping the sudden silence from making the situation even more awkward.</p><p>“What’s up with the sudden interest in my sex life? Fuck off, you creeps.” Agatha rolled her eyes. "She’s my ex’s sister, that’s all. Not that it’s any of your business, but I’d rather clear it up before baseless gossip starts spreading."</p><p>“Your ex, huh… Blonde? Tall? Maybe a PhD? Is that your type?" Carol asked from beside her, a teasing edge to her voice.</p><p>Jen and Wanda had already gone back to their own conversation after Agatha’s small outburst, while Will and Eddy had wandered off elsewhere. </p><p>Alice, however, was still stuck next to Rio, who stood firm, eyes locked on the interaction, unmoving.</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, Rio was already at her side, pretending to size Carol up from head to toe. "Actually, it’s the complete opposite of you. Sorry, you don’t fit the type at all."</p><p>Carol’s eyes widened at the sheer audacity of the student she had been trying so hard to ignore. But she recovered quickly and did what she did best— ignored Rio.</p><p>“Maybe that’s for the best. You know… trying out new <em> tastes </em>.” It was a clear attempt at flirting, one that didn’t sit well with Agatha.</p><p>Rio looked about one step away from earning herself a lawsuit, despite Alice whispering her name, urging her to walk away. </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, took a long, deep breath and exhaled slowly.</p><p>“Dr. Danvers, I’ve been clear once, twice— perhaps three times? So before I make the rest of this course <em> very </em> unpleasant for you, I suggest you tone it down. And maybe ease up on the drinking, too." Her voice was low, but just as sharp and cutting.</p><p>Carol’s flirty expression flickered into something that almost looked like hurt, but she recovered in record time. Without another word, she turned and walked off toward a small group of professors still chatting at the bar.</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair, already regretting overstaying at this gathering. Beside her, Rio still looked like a volcano on the verge of eruption. No one would be surprised if she was actually trembling with rage.</p><p>“I’m going to fucking kill her.” </p><p>“No, you’re not.” Agatha and Alice responded at the same time.</p><p>“Oh yes, I am. Or maybe I’ll just smash something on those ridiculous high heels.” Rio was, in fact, holding a bottle, and her gaze dropped to Carol’s feet, as if actually calculating how to use the glass to mutilate her if the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>“Rio, don’t be ridiculous. You’re not doing any of that.” Agatha rolled her eyes, her lips almost twitching into a smile at how absurd Rio’s plan was.</p><p>However, she didn’t even have time to think about smiling because Rio was already gripping the bottle by the neck and marching toward Carol.</p><p>“Rio, Rio—“ Alice tried to grab her hand, but Rio yanked free.</p><p>Alice shot a desperate look at Agatha, who fucking sprinted to catch up with Rio— who was already halfway to Carol.</p><p>“Rio, stop this nonsense, come on.” Agatha grabbed her arm, but Rio was surprisingly strong, so it wasn’t enough to stop her, only slow her down.</p><p>“Baby, look at me!” The pet name made Rio stop. She turned to Agatha, her eyes burning with anger.</p><p>They were still in the middle of the bar, with a few students and professors scattered around. The only solution Agatha could think of was to drag Rio into the bathroom while Alice let out a relieved sigh, grateful she wouldn’t have to figure out how to scrape together bail money for her best friend that night.</p><p>The bathroom was nearly empty, a few stalls open. Agatha didn’t hesitate— she shoved Rio into one, stepped in after her, and slammed the door shut.</p><p>“What the fuck, Rio? Have you lost your mind? What the hell were you thinking? That you could pull this shit with a fucking professor and your career would remain unscathed?”</p><p>Agatha was furious. Not quite at the throw a bottle at her level of mad, but still.</p><p>“This is your fault! Why don’t you shut her down? Looks like you enjoy her attention, and you love even more that I can’t do anything about it. I have to just stand there and watch like a fucking idiot.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened for a moment, taken aback by Rio’s words. The stall was too cramped for her to step back and get a proper breath, so she just tilted her head up and sighed. When she met Rio’s gaze again, her voice was much calmer than she actually felt.</p><p>“I know you’re saying this because you’re angry, so I’ll let it slide. I just said that to her, and I’ll make sure she understands that this kind of thing won’t be acceptable anymore. There’s nothing else I can do.”</p><p>“Yes, there is. You could stop keeping me a secret.” </p><p>Agatha scoffed, as if the mere suggestion was absurd. Which, to her, it was.</p><p>“You know I can’t do that. Not while I still have a direct influence on your studies.”</p><p>“Then I’ll drop your class.”</p><p>“Rio, cut the shit! You’re not dropping anything, enough with this nonsense.”</p><p>“It’s not nonsense! Why don’t you take what I’m feeling seriously, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha sighed again, rubbing the tip of her nose, torn between not wanting to make things worse and not knowing how to make them better.</p><p>She placed her hands on Rio’s neck, sliding them beneath her hair.</p><p>“I am taking this seriously, Rio. I just stopped you from getting arrested over something completely foolish—“ Rio opened her mouth to argue, but Agatha shut her down with just a look.</p><p>“Let me finish! You’re angry, jealous, tired, and probably drank more than you should have. You should leave.”</p><p>Even with Agatha’s hands on her neck, Rio avoided her gaze, looking everywhere but at her, staying silent as she let out small puffs of air in a failed attempt to calm herself down. Agatha could still see the truth in her eyes. There was no way they could stay in that bar with Rio in this state.</p><p>“I’m calling an Uber for you and Gulliver.” </p><p>Agatha reached for her phone in the back pocket of her jeans, but Rio stopped her, gripping her arm so tightly that her fingers would leave marks even through the blazer.</p><p>“You honestly expect me to go home and leave you here? With her?”</p><p>Rio finally locked eyes with Agatha, challenging her to give any kind of answer to that question.</p><p>“Don’t you trust me?”</p><p>“I don’t trust her.”</p><p>“What choice do you have?” It wasn’t meant to sound like a challenge, but that’s exactly how Rio took it.</p><p>Rio let go of the bottle she was still holding. It hit the floor and, miraculously intact, rolled out of the stall. Then, using both hands, she grabbed Agatha’s hair and kissed her, her tongue slipping into Agatha’s mouth, pulling a whimper from her.</p><p>Agatha pressed Rio against the stall wall, letting her hands roam across her body— abdomen, arms, breasts, ass. Almost unconsciously, her fingers found their way to the button of Rio’s jeans, but she pulled back before she could actually undo it.</p><p>“Fuck me, Agatha, right here. Just— fuck me.” Rio whispered, chasing her lips for a kiss that left no doubt her words were more of a need than a request.</p><p>Agatha’s body reacted instantly, with Rio devouring her in a desperate kiss, and she was sure she could smell Rio’s arousal. The combination of all these factors —plus the amount of alcohol she had consumed in the past few hours— left no room for hesitation.</p><p>She slid her fingers back into Rio’s waistband and unbuttoned her jeans in one swift motion, pulling the zipper down right after. Rio helped, pushing her own pants down to her knees and propping one foot up on the toilet seat, parting her legs to give Agatha all the access she needed.</p><p>“God, you’re already so wet.” Agatha murmured against Rio’s lips as her hand pressed between her legs, feeling just how soaked she was through the fabric.</p><p>“For you, always you.” Rio whispered, her voice uneven as she fought to keep her moans quiet while Agatha traced slow circles around her clit. “Agatha, stop teasing—“</p><p>She didn’t have to say it twice. Agatha pushed Rio’s underwear aside and slid three fingers inside her.</p><p>Rio's reaction was immediate. A sharp gasp escaped her lips, only to be muffled as Agatha clamped a hand over her mouth, feeling the warmth of her breath against her palm.</p><p>“Shut up! Be quiet for me, can you do that?”</p><p>Rio nodded frantically. Agatha hadn’t pulled her fingers out yet, all three still buried deep inside her, waiting to make sure Rio wouldn’t make the same mistake of moaning out loud again.</p><p>When Agatha finally removed her hand from Rio’s mouth, Rio immediately dropped her head forward, muffling any future sounds against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha started fucking her with a pace and force that made Rio’s back hit the stall wall with every thrust. The noise wasn’t loud enough to draw attention —could have easily been mistaken for something else— and that was all Agatha needed to keep going.</p><p>Rio tried her best to stay quiet, her mouth open against Agatha’s shoulder, barely holding it together. Agatha curled her fingers on every pullback, hitting that spot she knew would send Rio spiraling. She was well-versed in Rio’s body by now, and her fingers moved like they remembered the exact map to take her there.</p><p>As Rio got closer to the edge, Agatha’s shoulder was no longer enough to muffle the moans slipping past her lips. Agatha brought her hand back up, covering her mouth and pressing her head against the stall wall.</p><p>“Quiet!” Agatha ordered, thrusting her fingers deep again, Rio’s moan caught behind her palm, though not nearly silent enough. “You’re such a pathetic mess. Couldn’t wait any longer, huh? Your greedy pussy needed my fingers inside you, didn’t it?”</p><p>The dirty talk hit exactly the way it was meant to. Two more thrusts and Agatha's palm rubbing firmly against her clit was all it took. Rio came in a stifled scream.</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop, kept the same rhythm until she felt Rio’s leg —the one propped up on the toilet— start to shake and give out. Only then did she pull her fingers out and remove her hand from Rio’s mouth. </p><p>Rio was breathless, her chest rising and falling fast, eyes half-lidded and locked on Agatha.</p><p>As Rio watched, Agatha brought her fingers to her mouth, curling her tongue around them until they were clean, releasing them with a soft pop.</p><p>She tugged Rio’s pants back into place, fastening the button while Rio still seemed to be struggling to return to reality.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Feeling calmer now?”</p><p>Rio let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head before pulling Agatha in for a kiss.</p><p>“Agatha? Are you in there?” Wanda’s voice rang out from the sink area.</p><p><em> Fuck </em>. Agatha stepped away from Rio.</p><p>“Yes, I’ll be right out. Everything alright?”</p><p>“You tell me. I thought you had left without saying goodbye. You okay? Was it the beer?”</p><p>“No, no, I’m fine. Go grab our coats, I’ll meet you at the register.”</p><p>“Uh-huh, sure.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, pressing her lips together to keep from laughing at the situation. Yeah, she was probably more drunk than she thought. Rio, on the other hand, didn’t even try— letting out a small, breathy laugh as they exchanged looks.</p><p>Agatha unlocked the stall door and stepped out, Rio following close behind.</p><p>Only to come face-to-face with Wanda, leaning against the sink with her arms crossed.</p><p>“So much for being careful, you two.” Wanda said, her voice teetering between amused and serious.</p><p>“You just couldn’t have left, huh? Jesus.” Agatha groaned, moving to the sink mirror. Her hair was a mess, her lips red and swollen, and Rio didn’t look much better.</p><p>Rio stayed quiet, biting her lower lip, stuck somewhere between laughing and bolting.</p><p>“Obviously not. Gulliver said you came in here with Vidal and then disappeared. Doesn’t take a genius to figure it out.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, still fixing her hair in the mirror. “Why were you looking for me?”</p><p>“I thought we were splitting an Uber again. Or are you not going home tonight?” Wanda arched her brow, smirking.</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio. “Mine or yours?”</p><p>“Uh— mine? If that’s okay with you.”</p><p>“See? All free to go now.” Agatha said to Wanda, gesturing toward the bathroom exit.</p><p>“I’m not standing outside alone waiting for the Uber, Agatha. Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha turned on the faucet. “I really should wash my hands first.”</p><p>It took Wanda a few seconds to catch on, and when she did, she scowled. “Ew! Gross! You know what— I’ll be waiting at the register.”</p><p>She practically bolted out of the bathroom, leaving Agatha and Rio laughing.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Rio, for the love of god, I can’t—“ Her own moan cut her off, eyes rolling back and lids fluttering shut as Rio dragged the tip of her tongue from her clit down to her entrance.</p><p>Rio lifted her head from between Agatha’s legs and beamed, fully enjoying the gorgeous mess of a woman sprawled naked across her bed.</p><p>After getting back from the bar the night before, a hot shower was the only thing either of them had the energy for. Considering Alice’s room was just two doors down in a cramped apartment —and neither Agatha nor Rio were particularly quiet— they had simply gone to sleep.</p><p>Now? They’d been at it for god knows how long. After being woken up by Rio’s very intentional touches and her mouth trailing kisses down Agatha’s neck, collarbone, and the side of her breasts, Agatha hadn’t even stepped foot out of Rio’s bedroom— and had already cum four times. Rio, twice.</p><p>Rio was focused on a fifth orgasm, utterly unaffected by Agatha appearing on the verge of fainting. Her legs were tingling, her body aching and covered in sweat, her voice barely more than a rasp. Her hair was a wild knot on top of her head thanks to Rio’s fingers, which had gripped her like her life depended on it while Agatha fucked her and sucked her clit simultaneously moments earlier.</p><p>“Just one more, sweetheart. I know you can take it.” Rio whispered before lowering herself again. She was careful not to apply direct pressure to Agatha’s overstimulated clit, and between soft kisses she trailed across her pussy, Rio slid two fingers inside her without warning.</p><p>Agatha had long since shoved a pillow over her face to muffle her moans, and now she bit down on it hard, fingers clutching the fabric against her mouth while Rio used one hand to press down just above her pelvis and the other to fuck her relentlessly.</p><p>Agatha’s body was out of her control. Her legs trembled so violently she couldn’t keep them bent anymore. Her back arched as if trying to escape the onslaught— meanwhile Rio looked like she had made it her personal mission to ruin her. And she was succeeding. </p><p>Sweat trickled down Rio’s face and neck, something Agatha would’ve found dazzling if she wasn’t too focused on staying conscious.</p><p>Still thrusting her fingers deep, Rio lowered her mouth again —carefully avoiding direct contact with Agatha’s clit— and angled her tongue slightly to the left of it, using just the tip to stimulate her with masterful precision.</p><p>It worked as a charm. When Agatha's fifth orgasm hit, it felt like her entire body was about to levitate off the bed. Her back arched even more and Rio placed both hands firmly on her ass to hold her, grounding her through the overwhelming high.</p><p>As Agatha’s body finally collapsed flat onto the mattress, her chest rose and fell in frantic attempts to catch her breath. And Rio still hadn’t taken her mouth off her pussy. She was now licking her clean with slow, tender strokes.</p><p>“Baby, please, you’re gonna kill me.” Agatha whispered into the pillow. She had to use every ounce of strength left in her to reach down, tangle her fingers in Rio’s hair and pull her away.</p><p>Rio chuckled against her skin and obeyed, crawling up to lie beside Agatha, propped up on one elbow. She took the pillow out of Agatha’s face and watched her with a smug, satisfied little smirk.</p><p>“What the fuck was in your coffee this morning?” Agatha asked, wiping the sweat off her forehead and brushing away the strands of hair sticking to her face.</p><p>Rio laughed and reached over to help, gently untangling the messy strands stuck in every direction.</p><p>“What do you mean? I woke up like, five minutes before you.” </p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>Rio rolled over to grab her phone off the nightstand and held the lock screen up for Agatha to see: 8:04 am.</p><p>“You seriously woke up at the crack of dawn just to fuck?”</p><p>Rio cackled at Agatha’s words and tossed the phone back onto the nightstand. “And you say I don’t wake up early. Tsk tsk.”</p><p>They both laughed as Rio pulled the blanket over the two of them, clearly ready to pass out again. Agatha was on board— by her rough estimate, they’d gotten maybe five hours of sleep. Max. </p><p>However, as soon as they settled in under the covers, the discomfort of two sweaty, overheated bodies pressed together— and the staggering smell of sex and sweat— made them both scrunch up their noses at the same time.</p><p>“Maybe a shower first?”</p><p>“Yeah, probably for the best.”</p><p>-</p><p>“You know, at least at my house we’d have a decent breakfast.” Agatha said, perched on the chair in front of the counter, watching Rio rummage through empty shelves, clearly struggling to find anything that could assemble a breakfast.</p><p>Rio glared at her and slammed the cabinet shut. “Alice was supposed to do the grocery run this week! We can just order something—“ </p><p>“Today? Everything’s gonna be closed, baby. Best option is either we go grocery shopping, or you drop the stubborn act and we go to my place.”</p><p>Rio poured two mugs of coffee —the only thing she could offer— and slid one over to Agatha.</p><p>“I'm gonna get dressed and run to the store. You sit your cute ass on the couch. I won’t be long.”</p><p>“You’re going to leave me here alone? With Gulliver?”</p><p>“I swear I’ll be quick, sweetheart. You can wait in my room if you want. Super quick, promise!”</p><p>Rio gave her a quick kiss and disappeared into her room to change, leaving Agatha alone in the kitchen. She was far from comfortable, and the feeling only got worse once Rio actually left the apartment.</p><p>Agatha made her way to Rio’s room to grab her phone— and, for the love of God, open a window to get some air circulating. </p><p>She was wearing Rio’s clothes: gray sweatpants, a tank top, and a blue sweater layered over it. Her hair, still damp from the shower, hung down her back, and she was freezing cold.</p><p>Once again, her house had decent heating, too.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her coffee mug and made her way to the couch, where a blanket was neatly folded over the backrest. She settled into one end of the couch, pulled the blanket over her legs, and started checking her inbox.</p><p>She was halfway through typing a message to Paul, specifically about Nicky, when Alice walked out of the hallway and headed toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Oh, hey Prof— Agatha,” Alice said with an awkward smile, “Where’s Rio?”</p><p>Agatha finished her text and hit send before glancing up at Gulliver.</p><p>“Grocery shopping.”</p><p>Alice pursed her lips and poured herself a cup of coffee. </p><p>Agatha turned her focus back to her phone and didn’t notice when Alice disappeared into her room— at least not until she returned a few minutes later carrying her laptop. She set up at the counter, facing away from Agatha, and for a while, the two of them sat in an oddly comfortable silence.</p><p>That is, until Alice began muttering under her breath.</p><p>Alice didn’t make the slightest effort to hide that the source of her frustration was Agatha’s course— words like ‘hot spots’, ‘criminalistics’, ‘crime rates’, and ‘police initiatives’ were all muttered with some form of complaint or exasperated sigh.</p><p>Agatha took a slow, steady breath and got up under the excuse of bringing her now-empty mug to the sink. Her suspicion was confirmed the moment she glanced at Alice’s laptop and spotted her own class material pulled up on the screen.</p><p>She walked around the counter and set the mug down in the sink at a snail’s pace, silently counting the seconds until—</p><p>“How wrong would it be if I asked for your help right now?”</p><p>“No more wrong than what I’m doing with one of my students.”</p><p>Alice let out a sudden laugh that startled Agatha, but it made her smile anyway as she sat down on the seat next to her.</p><p>-</p><p>“You can’t take it <em> that </em> literally, Gulliver. Yes, the theory lays out the convergence of three things— motivation, the existence of a vulnerable victim or target, and the absence of anything that would prevent the crime. But each case has to be analyzed carefully. Even though environmental criminology has a bunch of branches, most of them stem from routine activity theory. That’s why the first assignment is for you to study that theory inside out.”</p><p>Still sitting side by side, Agatha had a sheet of paper in front of her where she sketched out flowcharts with circles, arrows, names of theorists, theories— Alice was looking at her like she had three heads.</p><p>“But like... opportunity and motivation kinda seem like the same thing? Depending on how you look at the situation.”</p><p>Rio entered the apartment, juggling two paper grocery bags and setting them on the counter. She blinked, surprised by how close and focused Agatha and Alice were, the two so deep in their discussion they barely noticed she was there.</p><p>“No, it’s not. You’re overthinking it. You don’t need to explain the motivation— you assume it’s already there. The offender wants to commit the crime. Opportunity is the context, the set of circumstances that make the crime feasible. For example, let’s say I want to rob a house. That’s a given. The opportunity comes from studying the house: its routines, schedules. I’ll pick a time when no one’s home, the neighbors are out, someone’s walked the dog… See? It’s not the same.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow as she put away the groceries, while Alice sat with her elbow on the counter, her hand on her forehead. “Yeah, okay. That makes sense.”</p><p>“Are you sure? Doesn’t look like it made much sense.” Agatha said, turning her head toward Rio, who was already watching them. Rio took the opportunity to walk over and wrap her arms around Agatha from behind.</p><p>“No, it did. I’m just a little dizzy.”</p><p>Rio laughed at Alice’s scrunched-up forehead as Alice kept staring at the sheet of notes Agatha had written.</p><p>“Sweetheart, why are you trying to give my friend an aneurysm?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and got up to head back to the couch— her good deed for the day was done, and she had no intention of turning her day off into a tutoring session.</p><p>Rio followed her over to the couch.</p><p>“So, on a scale from one to ten, how hungry are you?” Rio asked, sitting down beside her and playing with a strand of Agatha’s hair, letting it slip through her fingers.</p><p>“It was an eleven when you woke me up, actually.”</p><p>Rio smiled and leaned in to give her a quick kiss, and Agatha instinctively glanced around to check if they had an audience. Apparently, there was a risk she might have actually caused Alice to have an aneurysm— she was still in the same spot, wearing the exact same expression.</p><p>“Why don’t you put something on while I make breakfast?”</p><p>“You’re cooking?”</p><p>“It’s toast and eggs, Agatha. I think I can manage it.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, watching Rio head back into the kitchen.</p><p>With Friends playing on the TV, Agatha started to feel her eyes getting heavier, her attention slowly drifting away from the show— until the conversation from the kitchen pulled her focus back. A name in particular.</p><p>“Why is Yelena texting me to tell you to text her back?” Alice asked, still sitting at the counter while Rio stood by the stove.</p><p>“Oh, she texted me earlier about a paper we have to turn in for Water Management and I forgot to reply. It’s nothing urgent.”</p><p>“I thought you were only helping her out for the first few days. Why is she still clinging to you?”</p><p>“I think she’s having a harder time than she thought, I don’t know.”</p><p>While the conversation went on, Agatha kept her eyes on the TV, but not even Monica and Richard’s impending breakup could pull her attention away from the conversation between the students.</p><p>“Hard time finding a warm bed, maybe.” Alice muttered under her breath, laughing softly— barely loud enough for Agatha to catch. But oh, she caught it.</p><p>“My god Alice, shut up.” Rio murmured, and from Agatha’s peripheral vision, she could tell Rio had turned her body slightly to check if Agatha was watching them. But she kept her gaze on the screen.</p><p>“I’m just kidding, relax— Oh no way! She’s calling me.” Alice’s phone buzzed on the counter, and judging by the lack of a greeting and the silence that followed, she’d declined the call. “Here, I’ll finish that. Call Yelena back—she’s getting desperate.”</p><p>Agatha was fighting hard to keep a neutral expression.</p><p>“Hey babe, what’s up?” Rio said, which immediately drew Agatha’s eyes in her direction, because if Rio was calling someone <em> babe </em>, it had to be her, right?</p><p>Apparently not, since Rio was holding her phone to her ear and heading to her room.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and forced herself to watch the last five minutes of the episode. That one ended. Then the next one. Still no sign of Rio. Alice had already finished cooking whatever Rio had started on the stove and had gone back to her room, leaving Agatha alone in the shared space of the apartment.</p><p>It could have been hunger, exhaustion, lack of sleep, concern about her son— there were plenty of things that could explain her bad mood. It definitely wasn’t Rio leaving her alone for the second time that morning, locked in her bedroom talking to Yelena about god knows what, something Agatha clearly wasn’t supposed to hear.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>Agatha turned off the TV and marched straight to Rio’s room. She opened the door like it had personally insulted her entire bloodline, startling Rio, who was sitting on the bed, legs crossed, phone pressed to her ear.</p><p>Rio held up a finger to Agatha— asking for a second, a minute, or maybe a whole damn hour. Agatha didn’t have the patience for any of that. She walked over to the armchair on the other side of Rio’s bed, grabbed the clothes she’d worn the night before, and left the room without a word.</p><p>In the bathroom, she was just finishing getting dressed when Rio knocked on the door, calling after her. Agatha didn’t answer right away. She took her time adjusting her wrinkled blazer, tugging her hair free from the neckline of the tank top underneath.</p><p>When she finally opened the door, Rio was leaning against the wall across from it, her phone nowhere in sight.</p><p>“Why did you change clothes?” </p><p>Agatha brushed past her, carrying the borrowed clothes, and headed straight for Rio’s room again, Rio trailing just behind her. </p><p>“Because.” Agatha merely said, grabbing her purse from the same armchair her clothes had been on.</p><p>“Uh, okay... Breakfast’s ready.” Rio stated, watching as Agatha wrapped the charging cable neatly around the adapter to pack it away.</p><p>Agatha was half-turned away from her and Rio’s phone buzzed from somewhere in the sheets. Agatha’s eyes flicked to it— Yelena, calling again.</p><p>“Not gonna answer that?” She asked when Rio didn’t even glance toward the phone.</p><p>“It’s not important.”</p><p>“Don’t mind me— I’m leaving.” </p><p>Agatha slung her purse over her shoulder and turned toward the door, nearly crashing into Rio, who had suddenly stepped in front of her, blocking the way.</p><p>“What? Why are you leaving?”</p><p>“I’m tired. And cold.”</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on us doing laps around the block, if that’s what you’re worried about.” Rio said with a grin, still blissfully unaware of Agatha’s bitchiness. </p><p>“Well, you can do whatever you want. As I said, I’m leaving.”</p><p>Agatha tried to step around Rio, and after the third time Rio blocked her path, she folded her arms.</p><p>“What the hell is going on? You’re mad because Alice asked for your help off-campus? If that’s it, I’ll talk to her, tell her not to do it again. No need to be this pissed.”</p><p>“This has nothing to do with that, and I’m not pissed. I just want to go home.”</p><p>Rio put her hands on her own hips, staring at Agatha like she was a petulant child.</p><p>“Since when, Agatha? Everything was fine a minute ago. Did you think we’d have the whole place to ourselves? Or are you upset I took too long to make us something to eat? I know you don’t do well when you’re hungry.”</p><p>Agatha still had her arms crossed and her purse slung over her shoulder, and unless she completely lost it and jumped over the bed to escape, she didn’t have much choice but to stay put and try to explain to Rio that she was just really, <em> really </em> in a terrible mood.</p><p>“None of that! I already told you. I’m tired, I didn’t sleep well, I’m starving—“</p><p>“And I told you we were gonna eat and watch something in my room. I don’t get why that suddenly sounds like a bad idea to you.”</p><p>“Am I not allowed to go to my own house now? Is that it?”</p><p>“Not like this. Not when you’re mad at me and I don’t even know why.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes right as Rio’s damn phone started ringing again. Both of them looked toward the bed, and Rio leaned over the mattress to check her phone, unintentionally giving Agatha the perfect opening to walk past her.</p><p>By the time Rio had grabbed her phone and declined the call, Agatha was already putting on her sneakers, ready to walk out.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck is happening? Did Nicky’s dad call? Did something happen?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just finished putting on one sneaker. When she bent down to grab the other, Rio got to it first and held it close to her side.</p><p>Agatha stood up, staring her down. “Give it to me, Rio.”</p><p>“No. Not until you tell me what’s going on.”</p><p>It could’ve been comical if it weren’t humiliating— Agatha, one shoe on, the other foot in just a sock, standing in front of Rio, who was determinedly holding her sneaker hostage.</p><p>“You know what? Fine. Keep it.” Agatha used her socked foot to push off the sneaker on the other, then brushed past Rio and headed back to her room.</p><p>She sat on the bed, successfully wrinkling the last few unwrinkled parts of her outfit, and tossed her purse onto the armchair. Surprisingly, Rio didn’t follow her right away.</p><p>Agatha was scrolling through an online newspaper she subscribed to when Rio finally walked in balancing two plates and a mug.</p><p>She ignored her until Rio set the plates —eggs, toast, and bacon (bacon only on one plate)— down on the covers.</p><p>“Eat. I really hope starvation is the problem here, because that’s my last hope. Actually, my only one.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and they both ate in silence, Rio sneaking glances like Agatha might bite if provoked.</p><p>Once the plates were empty, Rio quietly took them back to the kitchen. While she was gone, for what felt like the millionth time, her phone started ringing again.</p><p>“Oh my god, this girl seriously needs more friends, for fuck’s sake—” Rio muttered when she reentered the room and saw Yelena’s name lighting up the screen.</p><p>“Don’t talk like you two aren’t close.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>Rio answered the call, phone pressed to her ear, already rising from the bed. But before she could take a single step, Agatha spoke again, visibly pissed off, “If you leave me alone again to answer that fucking phone, I’m out of here.”</p><p>Rio froze mid-step, eyes wide as she turned to look at Agatha. After a second, she nodded and looked away, focusing on the voice on the other end of the line.</p><p>“Hey… Yeah, but… In that case, email the professor or the department. I can’t help you—” Rio rubbed her temple, clearly frustrated. “Yelena, I can’t do anything today, and neither can you. So we’ll figure it out tomorrow— I have to go now. Yeah, okay. Bye.”</p><p>Rio made a show of turning it off, then tossed the phone under the pillow and sat back down on the bed.</p><p>“So, are you mad because I left you alone to go to the store, or because I didn’t want to interrupt your show, so I left you in the living room?”</p><p>“Oh, right, god forbid you interrupt me watching the newest episode that came out over twenty years ago.” Agatha snapped, sarcasm dripping from every word.</p><p>Rio only stared at her for a moment.</p><p>“Do I need to make you cum five more times to get the real Agatha back? Or should I just swing by a church and grab some holy water— 'cause clearly, something possessed you somewhere along the way.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. Not that the holy water idea was all that bad— honestly, she felt fully capable of spider-crawling like Regan MacNeil.</p><p>Rio didn’t look away, even when Agatha refused to answer. She knelt until she was straddling Agatha’s lap. Agatha crossed her arms, keeping her expression closed off.</p><p>“Hey, please talk to me—“ Rio said softly, cupping Agatha’s face with both hands. “Come on, sweetheart. It’s our day off, you don’t have to—“</p><p>“Don’t call me a damn pet name if you use it with everyone else.” Agatha snapped before she could stop herself, the regret immediate, wishing she could take the words back the moment they left her lips.</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised for a beat— then a slow, knowing smile crept across her face, like the final piece of a puzzle had just clicked into place. </p><p>Agatha tried to turn her face to avoid the smug look on Rio’s face, but Rio held her, not letting her escape that easily.</p><p>“Shit! You’re jealous?! You’re seriously jealous? Fuck—“</p><p>“No, I’m not—“</p><p>“Yes, you are! Shit— okay, first of all, I didn’t realize you even heard me calling her babe.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “Well, next time, maybe wait ‘til I’ve left the room before you start calling people that.”</p><p>Rio let out a low laugh, the kind that was way too smug for Agatha’s liking. And being pinned under her on the bed wasn’t exactly helping her keep her cool.</p><p>“Sweetheart, you do realize you’ve got me on the shortest leash imaginable, right? There’s zero chance I want anything or anyone else.” Rio said, uncrossing her arms and placing Agatha’s hands on her own waist. </p><p>“I’m not jealous.” Agatha declared as her fingers curled around Rio’s hips.</p><p>“Hmm, you sure about that? Because from where I’m standing, it does sound a lot like jealousy.”</p><p>“Well, you’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, yes I would. So come on, let me hear it from that pretty mouth. Just say you’re jealous.”</p><p>Agatha would’ve rather been actually possessed than sitting beneath Rio, with her looking down at her like that. Her eyes were all sparkly mischief, and that damn smile had basically taken up permanent residence on her face. </p><p>Agatha almost caved. Almost.</p><p>“Not happening. And I’m not.” She attempted to sound tough, but Rio saw straight through it and laughed regardless.</p><p>With the same maddening ease as before, Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrists and brought them together. Before Agatha could fully clock her little plan, Rio had her pinned— one hand holding both wrists above Agatha’s head, pressed against the headboard.</p><p>“Rio, let me go, come on—“</p><p>“Not until you admit you freaked out and went full bitch mode on me for no good reason.” Rio said, leaning in until her lips were just a breath away from Agatha’s. “You look so hot when you’re jealous, sweetheart.”</p><p>Admitting jealousy was <em> absolutely </em> off the table. Agatha had way too much pride for that. Also off the table was admitting that Rio pinning her down like that was, in fact, turning her on. And it wasn’t just pride holding her back from confessing that part, it was the very real fear that her clit might straight-up fall off from a sixth orgasm in a matter of hours.</p><p>Therefore, Agatha did what any sane person would do in such situation— she started thrashing to get out from under Rio.</p><p>She kicked her legs up all at once, nearly knocking Rio into the headboard, and squirmed her arms to break free from her grasp.</p><p>“Hey there, crazy woman— I’m not letting you go that easy—“ Rio laughed, trying to stay on top like she was riding a mechanical bull. And honestly, the comparison was so spot-on that it sparked her next words, “Not exactly how I pictured riding you, but I’ll take it.”</p><p>Agatha blinked— then a laugh burst out of her, with a few snorts. Rio cracked up too, and right on cue, Alice appeared at the wide-open door of the bedroom, staring at the chaotic scene: Rio straddling Agatha, pinning her down while both of them were howling with laughter, all while Agatha was fighting for her life to break free from Rio’s grasp.</p><p>“Huh… I’m just gonna close this door for you two— whatever the hell this is.” Alice said, and the laughter died down almost instantly. But she didn’t wait for a response, just shut the door with a decisive click.</p><p>The moment the latch clicked, Agatha let out a soft laugh through her nose, and Rio smiled down at her, that damn tooth gap making it impossible for Agatha to do anything but lean up and kiss her.</p><p>Rio released Agatha’s wrists and cupped her face with both hands. The kiss deepened with no hesitation, tongues meeting, tender and unhurried. Rio let out a low hum of appreciation as Agatha pulled her closer, and they only stopped when breathing became absolutely necessary.</p><p>Rio was already parting her lips, no doubt with something smug ready to spill out, but Agatha beat her to it.</p><p>“Don’t even start with that again or I will actually get mad.”</p><p>Rio wisely shut her mouth and just nodded, kissing her again.</p><p>“I got us some frozen pizzas for later, so we have something to eat during the movie.”</p><p>“What movie?”</p><p>“What do you mean <em> what movie? </em> We’ve still got a movie and a half left to finish the Final Destination franchise.”</p><p>-</p><p>The next day, after work, Agatha stepped out of her en-suite bathroom with a towel wrapped around her body just as Rio crossed the threshold into the room.</p><p>“I was starting to get worried. Thought you had slipped and broken a hip or something.” Rio joked, leaning casually against the wall and shamelessly watching as Agatha dropped the towel to slip into a pajama set.</p><p>“Fuck you.” Agatha replied, her tone so dry it made Rio laugh out loud.</p><p>Agatha finished changing and climbed onto the bed, undoing the tight ponytail at the top of her head. Her hair tumbled down in uneven waves across her shoulders and back, and she mentally noted to wake up earlier the next day to wash it before work. No amount of expensive hair cream could save it without the holy trinity: water, shampoo, and conditioner.</p><p>Despite the tangles, Rio couldn’t help herself when she saw Agatha wrestling with her ends, and sat at the edge of the bed where Agatha was already leaning against the headboard.</p><p>“Have I ever told you how much I love your hair?” Rio asked, reaching over and running a hand gently through the mess, stroking it.</p><p>Agatha smiled and made a thoughtful face. “You’ve mentioned it a few times.”</p><p>Rio grinned and kissed her before getting up to head into the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha bit her lower lip, anxiety slowly curling in her stomach, fed by how domestic everything had become. On most nights when Nicky wasn’t with her, this was her routine now. Rio in her home, sleeping in her bed. Hell, she missed it when it didn’t happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, comfort and anxiety weren’t mutually exclusive. There was a very fine line between Agatha being content with Rio’s presence and Agatha thinking it was all too much for something that wasn’t even a serious relationship.</p><p>Her spiral was interrupted by her phone vibrating next to her on the bed.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, and the anxiety that had only been a spark moments ago was now flickering into flames. She set her phone on the nightstand, but she didn't have much time to process her thoughts before Rio strolled out of the bathroom in shorts and a tank top and sat down next to her on the bed.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Rio asked, catching the brooding look on Agatha’s face.</p><p>She shook her head and tried to smile, but it came out crooked and fake enough for Rio to raise a brow.</p><p>“I’m fine, really.” Agatha tried again, and either it was convincing enough or Rio chose not to push it— because instead, she leaned in, cupping Agatha’s face and kissing her.</p><p>The rest of the night unfolded just like most others: they talked, Rio teased Agatha about something irrelevant, Agatha fired back with a few rude remarks that only made Rio laugh and shake her head. Mind-blowing sex. More late-night conversations about Agatha’s academic obligations and Rio’s classes.</p><p>And in just a couple of days, Agatha would scold herself for not having stretched out the night a little more —the banter, the teasing, the sex— because sure as hell, she was going to miss it.</p><p> </p>

<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">hey, sweetheart</p><p align="right">where are you</p><p align="right">just came by your office and it was locked</p><p> </p><p>Agatha locked her phone screen again and tossed it onto her bedside table.</p><p>After her last class of the day, not even a few doses of Pepto-Bismol had been enough to calm her upset stomach, and she ended up canceling her office hours, leaving early.</p><p>At home, she pondered whether or not to tell Rio about her plans for that night. The dinner, the talk, the barely concealed threat if she didn’t show up for both. But did she <em> really </em> want to deal with a possible argument or Rio’s likely jealousy a few hours before having to sit through small talk with Natasha and her family?</p><p>Not that she didn’t like Alexei and Yelena. At one point in her life, she had actually loved them like her own family. For years, even. The inevitable distance after the breakup was expected, of course, but for a long time, Agatha had wondered how they were doing. If Melina had adjusted to the lifestyle Alexei tried to enforce after they moved to the U.S., if Yelena had grown out of her rebellious phase, if Natasha ever regretted going back to Russia and leaving her behind.</p><p>Those were the kind of thoughts that would creep in on slow, uneventful days— or when something specific triggered a memory of Natasha’s family. It hasn’t happened in years, though. And Agatha was okay with that.</p><p>Agatha still had a few hours before she needed to leave the house, and nothing was enough to distract her. She tried reading, prepping lectures, organizing Nicky’s room, cleaning out her closet. Fuck, she even tried cleaning the floors.</p><p>With an exasperated sigh, she grabbed her phone and called Wanda.</p><p>“Why are you calling me when you are in the same building?” Wanda answered on speaker, Agatha could clearly hear her typing in the background.</p><p>“Because I’m home.”</p><p>“That’s new… Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, debating whether to lie and say she was. Which made zero sense, considering she’d left work early and was calling Wanda out of the blue.</p><p>She scratched the tip of her nose. “I’m kind of freaking out, to be honest.”</p><p>The sound of typing stopped immediately.</p><p>“Why? Do you need me to come over?”</p><p>“No, no— I’m meeting up with Natasha tonight. I mean, with her dad and sister too. For dinner.”</p><p>“Family reunion with the ex? Romantic.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“Be serious, Wanda. She wants to talk to me alone, and as much as I used to want that conversation, you know, to understand what the fuck happened nine years ago… Now that it’s actually going to happen, I kind of want to bail.”</p><p>“Okay, listen,” Wanda cleared her throat. “You have every right to want that conversation. I definitely would. You never got closure, and you deserve one— even if it’s almost a decade late. Just go, hear what she has to say, and that’s it. End of story. Unless… you’re hoping for something more out of it?”</p><p>Agatha paused for a few seconds.</p><p>What exactly was she expecting? An apology? A friendly hug? A night to reminisce about the good old times?</p><p>Fuck, her stomach twisted at the intrusive image of this night ending in a hotel room with Natasha.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous.” It was all she managed to say.</p><p>“So go,” Wanda replied. “Eat some good food, listen to whatever she has to say, and go home. Done. Did you tell Vidal about it?”</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>“Oh, come on, Agatha. I joke around but you two are basically glued to each other at this point. Don’t you think it might be a good idea? Kinda looks like you’re sneaking off.”</p><p>“Saying it like that makes it sound like I’m keeping Rio in the dark so I can go and fuck Natasha.”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m doing! You’re stressing me out more than helping. I’m hanging up.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t give Wanda a chance to reply before ending the call.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha had been sitting next to Natasha for about forty minutes, with Yelena across from her and Alexei at her side. The appetizers had been served, and they were now waiting on the main courses while listening to Alexei loudly recount —between bursts of laughter— one of the fifteen times he nearly crashed the car while driving on an icy highway in Iowa.</p><p>“Melina almost shit her pants! She was so pissed that night, I caught her looking up flights to San Francisco.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, much more reservedly, and brought her wine glass to her lips.</p><p>“Mom complains about the Midwest cold, but she’d literally die if she had to live somewhere like California,” Yelena added, sparking more laughter and nods of agreement from Natasha and their father.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed in her blazer pocket and she pulled it out discreetly under the table. Six unread messages from Rio.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and opened the chat.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">will said you left work early. you okay?</p><p align="right">i thought i’d sleep at your place, or you at mine</p><p align="right">sweetheart… are you mad at me?</p><p align="right">okay now i’m starting to get worried</p><p align="right">agatha?</p><p align="right">since you don’t wanna talk to me for whatever fucking reason, at least tell me you’re okay, agatha</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>A. Harkness</strong>
</p><p>I’m sorry. I might have caught a cold or something.</p><p>I’m resting at home. Talk to you tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>The reply came almost instantly.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<strong>Rio Vidal</strong>
</p><p align="right">sure</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at Rio’s text, but there wasn’t much she could do about it in that moment— not with Alexei calling her name. She slid her phone back into her blazer pocket and lifted her head in his direction.</p><p>-</p><p>Natasha had been oddly quiet throughout dinner. She chimed in here and there, sure, but she wasn’t steering the conversation the way she usually did. Still, Agatha ignored every time she caught Natasha glancing her way, like she was hoping for some kind of reaction. None came.</p><p>After the meal and a bit more small talk, Agatha found herself wrapped up in one of Alexei’s signature bear hugs, while he told her how proud he was of everything she had accomplished and how far she had come. She just nodded and smiled politely, unsure of what else to say. Yelena gave her a quick hug too, and in less time than she would’ve liked, Agatha found herself alone at the table with Natasha.</p><p>“We can head up to the bar at the hotel I’m staying at.” Natasha said, lifting a finger to call a passing server. “The wine selection is way better than whatever this sad excuse for wine is.”</p><p>“Since when do you like wine?”</p><p>Natasha gave a soft chuckle, pulling her wallet from her purse. “I don’t. But you do. Come on.”</p><p>-</p><p>The hotel bar, as expected in Westview during the fall, was barely occupied. The low hum of jazz in the background filled the silence as the two women sat side by side on the tall bar stools.</p><p>“I don’t plan on staying long, so get to the point.” Agatha said the moment the bartender placed their drinks in front of them.</p><p>“Always so straightforward…” Natasha smiled. “What do you want to know?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “You’re the one who pushed for this conversation, so I figured you had something to say. If not, well—” She pressed her palms to the bar, ready to slide off the stool, but Natasha caught her arm.</p><p>“No, you’re right. I do have something to say.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her arm free. “Go ahead.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I freaked out back then.”</p><p>Agatha let out a disbelieving breath, even glancing around the bar like she was trying to figure out if it was some kind of prank. Apparently not. </p><p>“That’s it? Are you fucking serious right now?”</p><p>“Look—“ Natasha took a deep breath, eyes fixed on the olive at the bottom of her martini glass for a moment before meeting Agatha’s blue gaze again. “I shouldn’t have acted the way I did. The engagement made everything feel too real, and suddenly I felt trapped. I didn’t even know if I wanted to build a life in the States.”</p><p>“The engagement? Not the almost seven years we were together before that? I don’t believe you.”</p><p>“Why would I even lie now, Agatha? What exactly do I have to gain from it?”</p><p>Agatha let out a huff, raising her glass and downing almost half of her white wine in one go. “I don’t know. I don’t know you at all.”</p><p>“Yes you do. And I know you. We had disagreements and went through difficult times, but you were the best relationship I've ever had.” Natasha said, finishing her martini and gesturing for another round.</p><p>“If that’s how you treated your best relationship, I can’t even imagine what you did to your worst.” Agatha muttered sarcastically, draining the rest of her wine.</p><p>“I didn’t think it’d be fair. To me or to you. Not when getting married meant staying in one place forever.”</p><p>“At no point did it cross your mind that maybe we could just talk about it?”</p><p>“Come on, hon. If I had told you I wanted to move back to Russia, would you have come with me?”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line.</p><p>“Agatha, you got an offer to lead a research project in Portland and turned it down. If I had said I wanted to go back to Russia, you would have laughed in my face. At best.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand went straight to her wine glass as soon as the bartender set it down. “Fine, I wouldn’t have gone to Russia with you. But does that automatically erase my right, as your fiancee, to know what the hell was going on? Because from where I was standing, we were fine. Everything was fine until it suddenly wasn’t. Until you went radio silent and left.”</p><p>For the first time, Natasha looked genuinely sad, almost remorseful. She lowered her gaze to the glass in front of her, slowly spinning the delicate stem of her martini between her fingers. “You’re right. I was a dick. I was a dick and you deserved better. I didn’t know how to handle how serious everything was… The engagement, our careers. So I took the easy way out. Ended it. Got out of your life as fast as I could, because if <em> anyone </em> could’ve made me stay, it was you.”</p><p>Natasha finally looked up, her eyes searching Agatha’s face, but Agatha looked away. </p><p>“Apparently, I couldn’t even do that.” She said quietly. “Anything else?”</p><p>“Those seven years were incredible, Agatha. Please believe that. I need you to believe that.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, her phone started buzzing inside her purse on the counter. Both of them glanced down at it, and when she saw Paul’s name on the screen, she sighed and picked it up, turning slightly away from Natasha as she answered. “Yes?”</p><p>“Sorry to call you this late. What’s the name of that allergy medicine you give Nicky?”</p><p>“Claritin. Is he okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, he was playing with the neighbor’s dog and hasn’t stopped sneezing since. Did you pack it in his backpack?”</p><p>“Why would I put Claritin in his school backpack, Paul?” </p><p>“Alright, I’ll go out and get some. Thanks.”</p><p>“Call me if he doesn’t get better.” Agatha hung up and turned back around to face Natasha.</p><p>Natasha’s eyebrows were nearly in her hairline, eyes wide in disbelief. Before Agatha could say anything, Natasha spoke, her voice noticeably higher.</p><p>“I initially thought you were talking about a dog, but fuck, you have a kid?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You know I’d never have a dog. A cat, maybe. A rabbit, probably. And yes, I do.”</p><p>“Holy shit. How old? How did that happen?”</p><p>“Pretty sure your law degree didn’t cancel out basic biology.” Agatha said dryly, taking a sip of her wine while watching Natasha roll her eyes. “He’s eight.”</p><p>Agatha expected silence— but instead got a low whistle. “Damn you moved on fast— Wait, Paul? As <em> Paul </em>? You dated him? Son of a bitch, I swear If I ever see him again, I’ll run him over and back up just to make sure. I can’t believe he did that to me! Always saying we were such a great couple, all that bullshit, and the son of a bitch was just waiting—“</p><p>Agatha cut her off. “We didn’t date, but I don’t owe you an explanation. And I believe we’ve discussed—“</p><p>“What's his name? Your son.”</p><p>“Nicholas.”</p><p>“Does he have your blue eyes too?” </p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Figured you wouldn’t give those away so easily. I still haven’t met anyone with eyes like yours.” Natasha smiled, reaching up to tuck a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear.</p><p>Agatha turned her face away and Natasha settled her hand over hers instead.</p><p>“I'm glad things worked out for you, one way or another. I know I pissed you off these past few weeks, but I didn’t see another way to get you alone."</p><p>Agatha let Natasha’s hand rest over hers for a moment, but as soon as she started threading her fingers between hers, Agatha slid her hand back down to her lap.</p><p>“You promised you’d leave me alone after this. I kept my end by showing up. Now it’s your turn to keep yours.”</p><p>Natasha let out a slow sigh, then reached out again— this time placing her hand on Agatha’s thigh. She pressed her thumb against the fabric of her slacks.</p><p>“I’ve changed, and I can prove it to you. I still want you just as much as I did nine years ago, and I think you want me too.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head down slightly, eyeing the hand Natasha had pressed against her thigh, now with unmistakable intent. Her stomach churned again, way worse this time. </p><p>Agatha felt familiar fingers graze the side of her neck, and by the time her eyes lifted back to level, Natasha was already leaning in, eyes closed, moving toward her.</p><p>-</p><p>
<em> Agatha had been trying to call her fiancee for two hours. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She’d tossed her laptop bag onto the couch of the New York apartment they shared and, frustrated, headed to the kitchen to open a bottle of wine. Glass in hand, she checked her phone again— only to get even more annoyed: no missed calls, no texts, nothing. Zero. Not a damn thing. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Nat was supposed to be home by now. Her duties at NYU had wrapped up at least three hours ago, so the fact that she wasn’t home and wasn’t answering her phone was more than enough to leave Agatha on edge. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Half a bottle down, Agatha sat on the couch watching some stupid reality show when Natasha finally walked through the door. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Where the fuck were you?” Agatha asked, still seated, eyes fixed on the TV. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Nat took her time putting her phone and keys down on the table before even bothering to speak to Agatha. She walked around the couch and sat beside her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I was out having drinks with the girls. My phone was on silent.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha nodded and pretended to stay focused on whatever nonsense was playing on the TV while Natasha absently twirled the ring on her left hand. </em>
</p><p>
<em> It wasn’t exactly a rare situation between them. More often than not, Natasha made choices as if they didn’t share a life, a routine, a home. And every time, it made Agatha want to lose her shit. The pattern was always the same: a fight, a couple of days of silence, Nat in the doghouse— until they gave in, because physical need always seemed to outweigh the reason they ended up there in the first place. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Are you going to give me the silent treatment?” Natasha asked when Agatha leaned forward to refill her wine glass. “Because I’m exhausted, and if that’s how the rest of this night is gonna go, I’m going to bed.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “For the fourth night in a row, you've kept me in the dark about your whereabouts and your plans. How precisely should I react to that?” Agatha said, turning on the couch to face her fiancée. The dark circles under her tired eyes were hard to miss, but that wasn’t anything new. They both spent more time at the university than outside of it, and more often than not, sleepless nights left their mark. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You need to know where I am every second of the day now? Is that how it’s gonna be? Just because of this?” Natasha held up her left hand, the engagement ring on display. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha exhaled sharply, completely thrown by the way Natasha made it sound like she was asking for something absurd. As if wanting to know where the hell her own fiancée was had suddenly become unreasonable. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Is that what I said? Honey, I’ve been trying to talk to you and you’ve been ignoring all my calls. If I want to make plans with you, I might as well send smoke signals, because apparently that’s the only way I’d get through to you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “We live together, Agatha. We see each other every day. God forbid I actually want to have a life outside of this.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha’s patience was hanging by a thread. She set her wine glass on the floor next to the couch so she could fully turn toward Natasha. When she reached for her hand, Nat pulled it away. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What the fuck is going on with you? Did I do something? Did I kick your mom and forget about it? Fuck—“ </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I think we shouldn’t talk right now. I’m going to bed.” Natasha got up from the couch, and Agatha was on her feet almost instantly. Her vision darkened for a moment and the room seemed to flip sideways, forcing her to steady herself against the arm of the couch. Nat noticed and let out an annoyed sigh. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re fucking drunk?” Nat asked, not offering a hand as Agatha struggled to stabilize herself against the pull of gravity. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I just stood up too fast.” Not exactly a lie. Still, seven years together was more than enough for Nat to know when her fiancee was intoxicated. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Yeah right.” She rolled her eyes and headed toward the bedroom— followed closely by a tipsy Agatha. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Don’t you dare pretend I’m being irrational! You have been avoiding me for days. You think I haven’t noticed?” Agatha raised her voice as she stepped into the bedroom. “Are you fucking cheating on me?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Natasha had her back turned, but she spun around at the accusation, eyes wide, her finger pointing straight at Agatha. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Cheating on you? I was the one who proposed to you, Agatha! Why the hell would I do that just to cheat a few months later?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Then why propose to me if you were just gonna ignore me afterward? Was it just for the high of hearing me say yes? Now that you got it, screw everything else?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re being a lunatic— I thought it would take longer for you to turn into your mother.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> For the second time that night, it felt like the ground had been ripped out from under Agatha’s feet. She took a step back, shaken to the core by the comment that had fallen from Nat’s lips like a curse. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Being compared to the devil under any name from any religion was acceptable, but comparing Agatha to Evanora Harkness was the lowest blow imaginable. And Natasha knew that. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Realizing immediately just how deep her words had cut, Natasha moved toward her. “Hon, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—“ </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha pushed her back, her vision blurred with tears she was trying hard to keep from falling.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Why are you doing this?” Agatha demanded, her voice quivering as she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Natasha didn’t try to approach her after the shove. As much as they had never crossed the line into physical aggression, moments like this —rare as they were— weren’t new. And every time it had happened, Natasha had always tried again. Reached for her. Or tried to do something. Anything. The fact that she didn’t this time broke Agatha even more. Now the tears came freely, and she couldn’t stop them. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don't know. I shouldn't have said that, I'm sorry. I think I should sleep at Yelena's tonight.” Natasha had tears slipping down her cheeks too, though nowhere near the flood running down Agatha’s face, where her mascara had already started to smudge into dark marks under her eyes. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re leaving? Actually fucking leaving?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Just for tonight. I don’t think we’re in a good place to talk right now, and honestly… it’s for the best. I’ll text you tomorrow, okay?” Natasha waited for a response, but none came. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She sighed and stepped closer, and this time Agatha let her. Natasha brought her hands up, cupping Agatha’s face, and kissed her forehead, each cheek, and finally her lips. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I fucking love you, don’t ever forget that.” She whispered against her mouth before kissing her one last time. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha only nodded and stood there, silent, as she watched Natasha walk out the door. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She finished the bottle of wine and smoked a joint until she passed out in bed. As chaotic as the night had become —far more than she could’ve predicted just a few hours earlier— her relationship with Natasha was never exactly peaceful. But they always found their way back. Always. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The next morning, despite a throbbing headache (emotional and alcoholic), she went through her routine and went to NYU, checking her phone every other minute, hoping for a text from Nat. To say she was barely productive would be generous. Her attention span was nonexistent and every buzz from her phone had her dropping whatever she was doing to check. It was pathetic and she was very aware of that.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The day dragged by at a snail’s pace, and though no message had come through yet, Agatha knew she’d have to go home eventually and face whatever conversation was waiting for her. It would probably be tough, maybe even messy, but hopefully, with any luck, it would end better than the night before. </em>
</p><p>
<em> To say Agatha was surprised to find the apartment empty would’ve been an understatement. She called out for Nat a few times as she kicked off her shoes, her mind so locked on the impending conversation about their relationship that she didn’t even notice Natasha’s keys sitting on the table. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She headed toward their bedroom, and while everything looked the same, something felt… off. She called for her fiancee again— nothing but silence. With a hand on her hip, Agatha took a few deep breaths, trying to silence the anxiety clawing at her insides, screaming that something wasn’t right. Then her eyes landed on something small and glinting atop the blanket tossed over the bed. She squinted, stepped closer, and picked up Natasha’s engagement ring.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> A wave of nausea surged up from her gut to her throat. Hand covering her mouth, she stumbled toward their closet, only to find it partially emptied. </em>
</p><p>-</p><p>“What the <em> fuck </em>do you think you’re doing?!” Agatha tilted her head back to dodge Natasha’s lips, but not far enough to create real distance, not with Natasha’s hand still holding her neck in place.</p><p>“Come on, Agatha— Skip the part where you pretend you’re not into it and I have to chase you until you admit you want my hands all over you.”</p><p>Nat leaned in again, and Agatha turned her face away, placing her hand over Natasha’s arm in an attempt to break the contact. But unless she was ready to cause a scene in the bar of one of the city’s most expensive hotels, she wasn’t exactly succeeding.</p><p>Natasha settled for brushing her lips close to Agatha’s ear instead, her hand sliding into her hair, fingers tangling in the strands. “I love when you play hard to get… And I know you love it when I don’t take no for an answer—“</p><p>Suddenly, a chill ran up Agatha’s spine, like a bucket of ice water had been poured down her back. Judging by how quickly Natasha pulled away —so fast she nearly toppled off her barstool— it was clear she’d felt the same jolt. For a millisecond, Agatha felt relief, thinking Nat had finally gotten her head out of her ass.</p><p>Except the feeling was way too real. And then there was a third voice coming from somewhere behind her.</p><p>“I can’t believe you.”</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Agatha stood up abruptly, feeling her sweater cling to her back —because for some reason, she was literally fucking soaked— and there was Rio, standing just a few feet away with a haunting expression on her face, holding a tall, now-empty glass.</p><p>In an instant, Natasha was on her feet beside her.</p><p>“What the fuck?! Are you insane?” Natasha snapped, her tone sharp and accusatory.</p><p>“Rio, that’s not—“ Agatha started, only to be immediately cut off.</p><p>“Save it. Fuck you, by the way.” Rio pointed at Natasha. </p><p>Natasha blinked, stunned, staring at the student, though clearly not noticing how Rio looked like she was torn between running or lunging at her. “Hold on— You’re with<em> her </em>? You’re sleeping with a student?” Natasha asked, disbelief flooding her voice.</p><p>“We’re done here.” Agatha grabbed her purse from the bar, ignoring the wide-eyed bartender watching the drama unfold.</p><p>Rio let out a deep exhale just as Natasha reached out to grab Agatha’s arm. Rio slammed her empty glass down on the bar and stormed off.</p><p>“Don’t fucking touch me.” Agatha hissed, venom in her voice, and took off after Rio, ignoring the curious stares of some patrons at the bar.</p><p>Agatha picked up her pace and managed to catch up to Rio just as she was stepping out of the hotel. “Rio, that was not— Rio, fuck, <em> wait </em>!” </p><p>Rio stopped on the sidewalk, arms crossed tightly over her chest, and turned to face Agatha like she was lining up a shot. A direct hit. And judging by the dangerous glare she threw at her, that’s exactly what it was.</p><p>“What are you gonna say? That it wasn’t what it clearly was? I’m not some fool, Agatha. If it wasn’t exactly what I think it was, you wouldn’t have lied to me. You fucking lied. All day!<em> ” </em></p><p>“I didn’t want to start a fight with you. Not about this, not about her— Wait, how did you even know I was here?”</p><p>“How <em> convenient </em> of you, sparing yourself the trouble of saying you were meeting your ex at a fucking hotel.” Rio shoved a hand into her pocket and tossed the hotel card at Agatha. “I went to your house and you weren’t there. You said you weren’t gonna fuck her! You said there was nothing going on between you two.”</p><p>Agatha could only pay attention to the card she was absolutely sure she had left in her desk drawer days ago. </p><p>“Where did you get this? Rio— You broke into my office?”</p><p>“I still have the key.”</p><p>Agatha was stunned for a second, then it hit her. Rio did still have the key. She had never given it back after the whole flash drive incident during the seminar. Agatha had a spare, and with everything that had happened since then, she had completely forgotten.</p><p>“So you went to my office. For what? To snoop through my things? Do you even realize how fucked up that is?”</p><p>“Oh, really? And you sneaking around to fuck your ex is totally fine? My bad, Agatha, you’re right— I’m the one in the wrong here.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed the bridge of her nose, silently wondering how everything had spiraled so fast, so chaotically.</p><p>“That’s not what I said and that’s not why I came. I told you I was going to talk to her. You knew that this would happen eventually.”</p><p>“If you only came to talk, then why the fuck did you lie to me about it? How naive do you think I am, Agatha? How the hell am I supposed to believe you when all you ever do is hide things from me and lie?”</p><p>“I'm sorry, Rio, but since when am I obligated to tell you my every move? In what world does a casual relationship come with that kind of rulebook?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t truly meant to hurt her but that’s exactly what she did. Rio took a step back, putting more distance between them as they stood yelling on the sidewalk in front of the hotel.</p><p>“<em> Casual </em>? That’s what I am to you? We sleep together half the month, we go to campus together, we cook together, for fuck's sake! And now I’m just some hookup? I helped your kid with his homework! I listened to you talk about his dad, and you listened to me—“ Her voice cracked, and under the streetlights, Agatha could see the tears trailing down Rio’s face. “How dare you, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp breath as Rio’s words hit her like arrows, piercing through the highest walls of her self-defense. The only thing keeping her from throwing up from the nerves right there in front of Rio was the fact that her body was too busy trying to handle the icy wind cutting through her wet clothes.</p><p>It wasn’t the first time she’d seen Rio cry, but it was definitely the first time she’d seen her like this. And knowing she was the reason for it only made the knot in Agatha’s throat tighten.</p><p>“I never said you were just a hookup, stop putting words in my mouth. Look, you got it all wrong, and I can explain— just not like this. Not while we’re yelling at each other in the middle of the street.”</p><p>Rio sniffled, arms still crossed, her whole body rigid. She shook her head. “So far you’ve called me a fool, naive, and now dense. You’re right, Agatha. You’re clearly too good to be in a relationship with someone like me. I was never gonna be anything more than an easy fuck to you.” </p><p>“Rio, please, it’s not like that! I wouldn’t risk my position if you were just some booty call and you know that. You're saying this because you’re angry, and I don’t blame you for that, but I told you, so many times, I only came here to talk to Natasha. That’s it. You just showed up at a really poor timing—“</p><p>“Oh, fuck you, Agatha. Poor timing? That’s what you’re calling this?” Rio scoffed. “I admit I was stupid enough to think you felt the same way about me as I did about you— Fuck, Agatha, I fucking love you.” Rio cried again, sending Agatha into a full-blown panic, not just because of how many tears were pouring out of her eyes, but because of what she’d just said.</p><p>Any coherent thought fled Agatha's brain. All she could do was stand there, frozen, mouth slightly open. Trust Rio to tell her to go fuck herself and then drop the love confession mere seconds later. Fucking whiplash.</p><p>When Agatha didn’t answer, Rio let out a sour laugh that bordered on sarcasm. “Guess it’s on me for feeling this way when you clearly don’t.”</p><p>She was still crying, and Agatha could feel a dread creeping in at the finality in Rio’s tone— because this couldn’t be how it ended, right? They couldn’t leave it like this. Agatha wasn’t ready to go back to a life where Rio wasn’t a part of it.</p><p>However, before she could formulate any sentence to convince Rio not to leave, Rio spoke the few words that Agatha had no idea how to argue against.</p><p>“Goodbye, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. She stood frozen on the sidewalk, watching Rio walk away in the opposite direction, her jaw clenched too tightly to speak, her thoughts dissolving into smoke.</p><p>Not in a million years, not across a million universes, could Agatha have imagined herself trembling in the cold on some sidewalk, on a random Friday night, crying over a student from her own university.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Are we in a Taylor Swift music video or what?” Alice called out from the treadmill area, watching Rio do an aggressively angry set of dumbbell bench presses. When her friend stayed silent, Alice started humming ‘Down Bad’.</p><p>Rio was lowering both dumbbells to her chest and then pushed them back up with a sharp breath, sitting up quickly to drop them to the floor. She looked up at Alice, who, despite the grin on her face, wore an expression that landed somewhere between amused and utter pity. </p><p>Wiping a mix of sweat and tears off her face with her hands, Rio didn’t say anything as Alice walked over and sat on the bench beside her. Alice smiled and started singing, “Now I’m down bad crying at the gym—“</p><p>“Do you ever shut up?” Rio barked, standing and heading toward the locker room with Alice right behind her.</p><p>It was Sunday, and her Sunday routine used to start at the gym. Or at least it used to, before the gym dropped to the bottom of her priority list on the mornings she woke up wrapped in Agatha’s arms. Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>After a night where her body didn’t seem capable of not producing tears, Rio woke up on Saturday with a pounding headache, a swollen face, and red eyes. At least she had cried out everything she had and could move on with her life. Except Alice demanded the full story of what had happened the day before, and Rio ended up crying twice as much. Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>Apparently, her lacrimal glands were working overtime, because no matter how hard she tried to focus on anything else, eventually the tightness in her chest would return, and so would the tears again. All because of Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>On Sunday night, Rio was sitting on her bed lacing up a pair of black combat boots when Alice opened her bedroom door in pajamas. Her eyes widened the moment she saw Rio dressed in an outfit that screamed not their typical Sunday night— one usually reserved for sweatpants, cheap wine, and some movie or trashy reality show.</p><p>“Going out?” </p><p>“Yeah, I can’t stay home without feeling like I’m losing my mind.” Rio said, tightening the laces.</p><p>“I’m coming with you. Wait for me, will ya?” Alice disappeared into her room, and the sound of drawers slamming open and shut echoed down the hallway while Rio finished getting ready.</p><p>Once they were both dressed, Alice was swapping her stuff into another purse when she raised a brow at Rio’s phone, which had been very intentionally left on the kitchen counter.</p><p>“You still haven’t turned on your phone?”</p><p>“No. And I’m not going to.” To reinforce her point, Rio shoved the phone further away.</p><p>“Rio, you can’t ignore her forever. Don’t you have a meeting with her tomorrow? And class? She’s teaching the course this week—“</p><p>“I’m going to talk to Professor Kale tomorrow and ask to be removed as her assistant.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s gonna be that simple... What about the course?”</p><p>“I’ll drop that too.”</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Alice, I can’t stand to look at her. I told her I fucking loved her, and for what? For her to see me as some fuck buddy? It was humiliating, and that Witch can burn in hell—“ A sob crawled up her throat, and her eyes welled with tears. She dabbed carefully under her eyes to avoid ruining her makeup. “Let’s just go.”</p><p>-</p><p>A few hours later, Rio was handing over some bills to a guy who was a friend-of-a-friend from her grad program, in exchange for a baggie of party pills.</p><p>Since no club in Westview was open on a Sunday night, Rio and Alice had ended up at a house party thrown by some undergrad Rio barely knew by name— but the low lights and loud music were more than enough to keep her mind off Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>“Not this again—“ The panic in Alice’s voice was unmistakable the moment she saw the baggie in Rio’s hand. Rio, in turn, took a swig of her beer to swallow one of the pills.</p><p>“It’s not the same thing as last time. Alice, I swear on our friendship, if you call her—“</p><p>“Whatever. I’m warning you, Rio, if you end up like last time, crying on the floor, barely moving… I’m calling a fucking ambulance. No hesitation. Got it?”</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes and nodded before disappearing into the crowd of people dancing in what was once probably a living room.</p><p>By the middle of the night, Rio had already taken the second of the two pills she bought. Add the beer on top of that, and she was on cloud nine. Well, almost. Because no matter how much she danced, surrounded by a blur of bodies she no longer recognized, every time a hand landed on her waist, she felt like the air had been knocked out of her lungs. And then the guilt would rise, slow and burning, from her stomach to her throat.</p><p>Guilt over what, exactly? Her high and drunk brain couldn’t quite piece it together. All she knew was that those hands weren’t the right ones. Those voices whispering in her ear weren’t the one she wanted to hear. And those bodies pressing in close… None of them smelled like her. Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>After the last time she shoved someone away —a guy, no less, for god’s sake— Rio had walked drunkenly toward one of the couches and collapsed onto it, covering her face with her arm. The few lights in the room felt like they were drilling straight into her eyes.</p><p>The same guy from earlier sat down next to her, way closer than necessary, considering she was the only one on the three-seater, and casually slung an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>“You’re a wild one, aren't you?” He said, leaning toward her ear, his warm breath brushing her cheek. Rio lowered her arm and turned to face him.</p><p>“Get the fuck away. I hate men.” Her voice came out slow and slurred, almost unintelligible. </p><p>He just laughed, clearly more wasted than she was, and slid his hand under her armpit, trying to pull her even closer. “You just haven’t had the right one yet, baby.”</p><p><em> Baby </em>. Fuck. </p><p>Rio was never one to get attached to pet names— not from friends and definitely not from girlfriends. However, when Agatha called her ‘baby' for the first time during one of the nights she fully surrendered to Agatha’s dominance, something inside her shifted. She started to crave hearing it from Agatha’s lips. And now… That felt more like a distant dream than any version of reality.</p><p>Before Rio could flood both of them with tears, Alice appeared in front of the two and pointed straight at the guy. “You, out. Only way she would even talk to you is if fucking your mom and your sister was part of the deal. So scram.” </p><p>Stunned, the guy looked like he considered staying —still had his arm half around Rio— but gave up the second Alice looked ready to drag him out by the collar. He stood up, grumbling, and stumbled away. Alice dropped down into his place on the couch.</p><p>Rio’s pupils had swallowed up the brown in her eyes, and even though her face was turned toward Alice, looking at her, she wasn’t actually seeing her. Her mind was moving at about 0.25x speed.</p><p>“Ready to leave? It’s almost four.” Alice said, twisting open a bottle of water and handing it to her.</p><p>“I need to talk to Kale. At eight.” Rio mumbled, taking the water and chugging it in one go. Alice had two more bottles balanced on her lap and handed her another.</p><p>“It’s gonna take hours for the effects to wear off. You’re going in the afternoon."</p><p>“No. I have to talk to Kale before the meeting. With her.”</p><p>Alice sighed. She knew there was no point trying to argue with Rio in that state, so she settled for watching her down a second bottle of water. Instead of handing over the third and risking a disaster in the backseat of their Uber, Alice stood up and gently pulled Rio up with her.</p><p>Rio stumbled, then slung an arm over Alice’s shoulders to steady herself.</p><p>-</p><p>“Vidal, what are you saying? You signed a contract that clearly stated your responsibilities as Harkness’ assistant would last until the end of the course. It's too late to back out now. The protocol is clear.” Jennifer spoke from behind her desk, eyeing Rio with concern as she sat across from her. “Are you struggling to balance this with your research and classes? As your advisor, I can give you an extension on your methodology submission. That’s the most I can do.”</p><p>Rio kept her head down, arms crossed tightly over her chest. She inhaled slowly through her nose. “I’m fine. I can handle it. Can I still drop the course?”</p><p>Jen frowned. “Do you realize how that would look on your academic record? There’s just a little more than half the course left. I know it’s a lot, but this was your choice. You signed up for both. My advice? Take a deep breath, stay later than usual, be patient. Ask Harkness for help if you need it. I’m sure she wouldn’t mind lending a hand.” Jennifer smirked, completely unaware of the storm behind Rio’s eyes every time Agatha’s name was mentioned.</p><p>“I don’t care what my academic record looks like—“</p><p>“Vidal, do you want to apply for a PhD here? Or anywhere else? Your academic record is the first thing they’ll look at.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Fine, that’s fine. Thank you.” She didn’t give Jen a chance to say anything else before walking out of the office.</p><p>-</p><p>Sue her, but Rio was crouched behind her car in the campus parking lot, smoking a joint to calm her nerves. She knew she couldn’t avoid Agatha much longer— especially after missing the meeting with her and Danvers earlier that day. It was only a matter of time before she’d have to face the inevitable.</p><p>She pulled her phone out of her pocket and turned it on for the first time in days. As soon as the screen lit up, a flood of notifications appeared. Among them, several missed calls from Agatha. Thirteen, in total, over the days her phone had been off. No texts.</p><p>The nonstop buzzing of her phone caught William’s attention. He called her name, making her frantically put out the joint on the asphalt and toss it into the sunglasses case she used as stash.</p><p>“Oh, Rio, I thought that was you! How’s it going?” He asked cheerfully, stepping in front of her with his backpack and car keys in hand.</p><p>Rio forced a smile. “Hey, Will. Just killing time. Everything alright with you?”</p><p>“Great. On my way to grab my fifth coffee of the day from the cafeteria. Wanna come?”</p><p>“No, thanks, though.”</p><p>“You got anything going on right now? Agatha said that if I ran into you, I should tell you to stop by her office.” He glanced at his watch. “She should be done with her class by now. But fair warning, she’s in a terrible mood. Like, really bad. But you’re probably the only person she won’t murder with a single look, so I guess you’re safe.”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together. She didn’t have anything urgent for the rest of the afternoon, but honestly, jumping into a pool of needles sounded more appealing than looking Agatha in the eye.</p><p>“Actually, I—“</p><p>“She mentioned she might stop by your lab today too, so maybe you will run into her there. Either way works, I guess. Anyway, I gotta run— see you around, Rio.” William smiled and gave her shoulder a quick pat as he passed by.</p><p>Oh, great. Fucking great. </p><p>Rio wasn’t even close to the Criminal Justice building yet and her damn eyes were already filling with tears. She took a few deep breaths, clenching her fists as she mentally ordered herself to stop acting like a fucking teenager. She needed to get her shit together. Immediately.</p><p> </p><p>It was probably one of the first times she’d ever actually knocked on Agatha’s office door. Her heart was ready to burst out of her chest, and she instantly regretted not finishing the joint before having to face Agatha.</p><p>“Come in.” </p><p>Agatha’s authoritative voice made Rio’s legs move before her brain even registered the motion, and suddenly she found herself face to face with her, surprising not only herself, but also Agatha, who looked genuinely stunned to see her actually standing there.</p><p>Rio closed the office door, turning her back momentarily to the professor to gather a bit more courage, then walked over to the visitor’s chair.</p><p>“Do you want to sit on the couch?” Agatha’s voice faltered at first, but quickly regained its usual assertiveness, matching her now neutral expression.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You missed our morning meeting today.”</p><p>“I tried to get out of it, but I guess that’s not possible. I’ll be here next Monday.” </p><p>“Rio, let’s talk. Please.”</p><p>Rio kept her head down, eyes fixed on the edge of the desk, because she didn’t trust what might happen if she looked into those blue eyes again. She just shook her head.</p><p>“There’s nothing to talk about, Agatha. You made yourself pretty clear.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t. I tried calling you all weekend. Did you block my number?”</p><p>“Phone was off. Sucks when someone deliberately ignores you, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Agtha took a deep breath through her nose, loudly, and Rio crossed her arms.</p><p>“Can we talk? I don’t have any more classes today. We could go somewhere—“</p><p>“God forbid someone sees you talking to me on campus, right? Wouldn’t want anyone thinking we’re fucking just for shits and giggles. Oh wait— that’s exactly what you were doing.”</p><p>“Rio, stop that. I just don’t want a screaming match in my office.”</p><p>Rio scoffed through her nose, clearly irritated, still refusing to lift her gaze. “Lucky you, then. I’ve got nothing left to say to you. And if that’s all, I’m leaving.”</p><p>“Wait!— Are you still coming to my classes?” </p><p>“Do I have a fucking choice?” </p><p>Rio didn’t notice the way Agatha flinched at her words, or how hurt crossed her face for a split second. Just as her eyes started to betray her —moisture building fast— she shoved her chair back and stood up abruptly, the legs scraping harshly against the floor.</p><p>Before she could reach the door, Agatha grabbed her arm. The sudden touch forced Rio to look at her, her tear-filled eyes meeting Agatha’s, something the professor caught right away.</p><p>“Rio, please—“</p><p>“Did you fuck her?” The words slipped from Rio’s mouth before she could stop them, originating from all the thoughts that had been chewing at her brain, the same ones that had triggered more than a few of her crying fits over the past days. The image of Agatha being intimate with Natasha, laughing and snorting at some dumb joke she made, kissing against a wall, tangled up in sheets, breathless and sweating. The tears started falling down her cheeks. </p><p>“No.” </p><p>“Did you want to?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>With the hand that wasn’t still caught in Agatha’s grip, Rio wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand. “I don’t think I can believe you.”</p><p>Agatha placed her other hand gently on Rio’s cheek, her thumb brushing along the edge of her cheekbone. She had to fight to keep it there, though, since Rio kept turning her face, trying to avoid the touch.</p><p>“Rio, please, I’m telling you the truth. I shouldn’t have lied, I know that. And I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio stopped resisting the contact at the sound of that apology— not that it did anything to stop the goddamn tears. She had no idea how she hadn’t passed out from dehydration at that point.</p><p>“How many <em> other </em> times have you lied to me, Agatha?” Her voice cracked. “Because now, everything you told me, about me, about Danvers, about Natasha, I don’t know what to believe. All I do know is that while I was falling for you, you were just having fun fucking a student in your spare time.”</p><p>Agatha flinched at her words, but she didn’t take her hand away from Rio’s face. If anything, she pressed her thumb more firmly against her skin.</p><p>“I’ve explained why I did it. Whether you agree with my reasons or not, I know now it was a huge mistake.” Agatha was closer now, their breaths mingling. “That day, I told you… You’re not that. So please, stop saying like you were some kind of toy to me.”</p><p>Rio was much closer to Agatha than she expected. Rio could easily close the distance and crash her lips on hers. To stop fighting her own urges and bury her nose in Agatha’s neck, as she could only catch the faintest trace of her scent at the moment. Her throat tightened, her heart was pounding with nervousness, agitated at the proximity and a sense of comfort at being near her again. However, the comfort could not last. She needed to go back to wanting to jump on Agatha's neck, not surrender to her.</p><p>She needed to pull herself together and remember why she couldn’t give in to what her instincts were screaming at her to do. So she swallowed hard and cleared her throat, trying to make sure her voice didn’t come out sounding as pathetic as she felt.</p><p>“You said what we had was casual, didn’t you? If you only need someone to fuck you every other week, there’s a bunch of students happy to casually help you out. Just give the poor souls a heads-up.” Rio took a sudden step back and yanked her arm free, breaking every bit of contact with Agatha.</p><p>Almost instantly, she missed the warmth of Agatha’s skin. And if Rio didn’t know better, she might’ve thought she saw a glimmer of tears in those blue eyes. But it had to be a trick —just her stupid brain playing games with her— because Agatha quickly narrowed her eyes, any trace of tears vanishing, and she spoke, her voice sharp as she stared Rio dead in the eyes. “Fuck, enough with this bullshit! I don’t want anyone else! What do I have to do to make you believe me? God, Rio, I’m trying here—“</p><p>“Nothing, Agatha! I can’t even look at you without being mad at you, and at myself, for being so fucking naive and stupid. You said all we were was casual, and you <em> still </em> think that. So fine, that’s what it was. I’m done. I just— I need to get out of here.”</p><p>Rio spun toward the door and before she could reach it, Agatha moved quickly, stepping in front of it to block her path.</p><p>“Okay, fine! What we had wasn’t casual. Is that what you want to hear? We never actually talked about it, and I made an erroneous assumption—“</p><p>“Let me go, Agatha.” </p><p>“I said what you wanted to hear!”</p><p>The door swung open behind Agatha, making her spin around, startled. Two sets of eyes landed on William, who quickly slipped into the office with a flushed face and wide eyes.</p><p>“I don’t mean to interrupt, but... I can hear you both from the hallway.” He said awkwardly, standing beside them and clearly doing everything he could to avoid eye contact. </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and turned her face away, jaw clenched. Rio, seizing the opportunity of the interruption, didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“I’m leaving.” She muttered, brushing past them in quick, determined strides— fully aware Agatha would never show affection or vulnerability in front of Will, let alone let it be seen she gave a shit about Rio.</p><p>-</p><p>A few days later, with no call, text, or sign of Agatha, Rio was actively making her week worse by being three beers in, slouched in a booth at the bar near campus with Alice, on a random weekday.</p><p>Her refusal to deal with the whole situation (or ex-situation, really) with Agatha was gradually shortening her liver's life expectancy. At this juncture, Alice had given up trying to talk her out of it. The most Rio was managing these days was a constant state of being slightly hungover, and that was when she wasn’t dropping acid at whatever party she stumbled into— like she had the night before.</p><p>Saying Rio was in a terrible state would be a compliment.</p><p>“What are you doing? This is a bar, not a damn library.” Rio mumbled, glaring at Alice, who was glued to her laptop across the booth.</p><p>Without looking up, Alice responded, “Unlike someone, I’m actually taking my classes seriously.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and dragged herself over to sit beside Alice instead. She squinted at the screen. “What class is this?”</p><p>“It’s for the extension project.”</p><p>Rio probably needed to cut back on the drinking, because she swore she could hear Agatha’s voice narrating the exact words on Alice’s laptop. That commanding tone she used on everyone but her. Well, sometimes she did, in bed, and Rio craved it. The voice that sent chills down her spine, especially when whispered in her ear, tangled between moans—</p><p>“Why are you blushing?”</p><p>Rio blinked. She tore her eyes away from the screen and grabbed her beer. “Not blushing. Just pure rage.”</p><p>“Mhm… Well, that makes two of you then, because she has been a nightmare. We had a meeting today and it only didn’t drag on because she ran out of ways to subtly humiliate anyone who dared to speak.”</p><p>“Tell her you love her and she will shut up real quick.”</p><p>Alice laughed. “You know, since you’re so set on not getting back with her, you should be gloating in the halls about bagging the Witch.”</p><p>Just the thought of sharing anything she had with Agatha made Rio’s stomach twist. Not because she was worried about the consequences for Agatha. She wanted to believe she didn’t care. The truth was, no one had the right to comment or make assumptions about them. Especially since the version of the story would probably portray Rio as a poor little victim who got seduced and then dumped by Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>Not that she currently felt much different.</p><p>“I’d never do that.” </p><p>“Yeah, I know. Witch might just be a nickname, but damn, did she cast a spell on you.” </p><p>Rio dropped her forehead onto the sticky table.</p><p>“Can you blame me? Have you seen her? I don’t even know if I’m ready to sit through her class tomorrow. Not fair that I hate her and she’s still hot as fuck.”</p><p>Alice chuckled, and started waving at the void. Rio raised an eyebrow and looked up just in time to see Yelena heading their way— thankfully, not with her sister. With any luck, that one was rotting in the pit of hell.</p><p>“Sup, girls.” Yelena grinned as she slid into the booth across from them. Both Alice and Rio greeted her back, but Yelena, never one to hold back, squinted at Rio’s face and said, “Holy crap, you look awful. Guess my ex-sister-in-law didn’t go easy on you.”</p><p>There was a brief pause— both Alice and Rio staring at her, dumbfounded. Of course Natasha told her sister about the scene Rio made at the hotel. Of course she did.</p><p>Rio’s face darkened. “Your sister somehow manages to be more of a gossip than a bitch, and that bar was already set very high.”</p><p>Alice elbowed her in the ribs at the same time Yelena burst out laughing.</p><p>“I won’t argue with that. Nat’s being a menace with this whole Agatha situation. I already told her, so many women in the world, why chase that one?” Yelena shrugged. “Agatha must be pretty good in the sack, cause Nat, and now you… I need to reconnect with her and ask for tips.”</p><p>Alice and Yelena cracked up while Rio just rolled her eyes, finishing off her beer in silence and muttering curses at both of them under her breath.</p><p>“Anyway… You two aren’t a thing anymore?” Yelena asked once the laughter died down and Alice turned her attention back to her laptop. </p><p>“Why do you wanna know? So you can tell your sister and she can run after Agatha? Not like she wasn’t already doing that.”</p><p>Yelena blinked, surprised by Rio’s sharp tone. Their friendship wasn’t exactly deep, but Rio was still one of the few people Yelena considered a friend on campus. So she dropped the playful attitude when she realized Rio was actually pissed.</p><p>“I told her to back off. She just didn’t listen. They’ve got a long history, and I had no idea you two were even together.” Yelena said more seriously, her accent thicker.</p><p>Rio had her elbow propped on the table, cheek resting on her palm. She rolled her eyes hard at the mention of their so-called history, which she didn’t give a shit about.</p><p>“We’re not anymore.” </p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Rio frowned, her throat suddenly dry from how many times she’d been venting about what happened. She’d only talked to Alice about it over the past few days, and if she was tired of hearing herself talk, she could only imagine how done Alice must be with the whole thing.</p><p>Indeed, she was, because while Rio was still debating whether to give Yelena the short version or just tell her to mind her own business, Alice muttered, eyes still glued to the screen.</p><p>“Agatha lied to her so she could meet and fuck your sister.”</p><p>Okay, that was a much shorter version than Rio had in mind. Yelena’s eyes went wide at Alice’s words, and she turned her gaze back to Rio.</p><p>“They didn’t sleep together— Nat would have told me if they had.”</p><p>Rio leaned back against the booth and crossed her arms, a half-conscious attempt to physically block the tiny flicker of hope sparking in her chest. No. She refused to believe Agatha’s words, so why the hell would she believe Natasha’s?</p><p>Not that Natasha had any reason to lie to Yelena, and Rio had a hunch that if they had actually hooked up, Natasha wouldn’t have gone out of her way to keep it quiet. Especially now that she knew about Rio and Agatha.</p><p>Rio was biting her lower lip, refusing to believe it, and also refusing to contest it. The silence stretched for a while until Yelena tried again.</p><p>“Rio, I have no reason to lie to you, and I’m pretty sure Nat would have told me if anything happened between them. I asked her how the conversation went and all she said was that things were fine until you showed up.”</p><p>Rio finally snapped. “I don’t fucking care. I’m not gonna run back to her arms just because she did the bare minimum, which was not sleeping with someone else while she was with me. She lied. She had so many opportunities to be honest with me, and she chose not to. And I don’t even know if that was the first lie or the tenth.”</p><p>Providing a small comfort, Alice placed a hand on Rio’s arm, while Yelena watched her, nodding like she understood where Rio was coming from. The blonde stretched her arm across the table and gave Rio a few light pats on the hand once Rio uncrossed her arms.</p><p>“I get it. I swear I won’t say a word about this to Nat, okay?” Yelena gave her hand a gentle squeeze before pulling back. “So, what can I do to get you out of this shitty mood? Throw a big ass party? Buy a ridiculous amount of alcohol? Go to campus, kick Agatha in the knee, and run for my life?”</p><p>Rio laughed, and Alice joined in. “None of that for now, but I may take you up on the party idea.”</p><p>Yelena grinned and gave her a thumbs-up. “Say the date and it’s done.” </p><p>But Rio’s smile faded just as quickly as it had come, and she leaned her head back, dragging a hand down her face. “Fuck, I don’t know how I’m gonna survive that class tomorrow, being forced to look at her for hours.”</p><p>Alice shut her laptop and turned to her. “I could roll you a joint to smoke on your way to campus. How’s that sound?”</p><p>“I will meet you both there after class, and we can come here and drink. I’ll even let you beat me at darts.” Yelena offered, smiling.</p><p>Rio felt genuinely grateful for the effort both women were putting in to help her feel even a little better— or at least like a shell of a person again. She let out a sigh, lips stretching into something close to a smile.</p><p>“Yes and yes.”</p><p>-</p><p>Later that night, Rio was curled up under her electric blanket, phone in hand, the screen casting the only light in the room. She’d spent nearly an hour mindlessly watching tiktoks, but now she was on a mission: to find Agatha’s instagram.</p><p>She knew Agatha wasn’t big on social media, but everyone had at least an account these days, even if they only posted once a year. There had to be something out there. She tried every combination of Agatha and Harkness she could think of— her search history was starting to look like grounds for arrest on stalking charges.</p><p>She let out a frustrated huff. Then it hit her: Agatha’s best friend, Wanda. A name (and last name) unique enough to make the search easier. </p><p>Bingo. </p><p>If moments earlier Rio could cause concerns for the police, now she would be the dream of any psychiatric ward with the way her finger slid through Wanda's photos, looking for Agatha.</p><p>Wanda’s instagram looked like a fan page dedicated to her twin sons, but eventually, Rio found what she was looking for: a group photo at a picnic. Agatha was there, sitting on a blanket next to Nicky, smiling at the camera. And she was tagged.</p><p>Rio’s smile flickered and vanished in the blink of an eye— Agatha’s profile was private. Fuck. All she wanted was a clear photo of Agatha without a freaking daycare center in the background. Not that she wouldn’t see her in person the next day, of course.</p><p>With a sharp huff, she tossed the phone onto the mattress and smacked the screen with her hand, annoyed that Agatha insisted on maintaining some ridiculous air of mystery, even on a fucking social media app. What <em> is </em> her deal?!</p><p>Frustrated, Rio picked the phone back up and nearly launched it into the ceiling when she saw that instead of “Follow,” it now showed “Requested.”</p><p>Holy fucking fuck. She instantly canceled the request and threw the phone back onto the bed like it was on fire. There was a good chance Agatha didn’t even have the app installed on her phone, right? Right… Rio started laughing at her own stupidity—</p><p>Until her phone rang and she didn’t even need to check the screen to know who it was.</p><p>Shit. Rio pushed the blanket away from her as her body began to heat up and she could feel sweat trickling down her back. And it was only the second ring. She grabbed her phone and swiped to answer.</p><p>“… Hi?” Her voice came out raspy from lack of use, and she cleared her throat. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a few seconds, and when she finally spoke, Rio could almost hear the smirk in her voice. “Were you stalking me?”</p><p>“No. Shouldn’t you be asleep?”</p><p>“Could say the same. Odd thing though… pretty sure I got a notification that Rio Vidal requested to follow me on instagram.”</p><p>Rio sat up in bed, tucking her legs underneath her. “Nope, don’t think so.”</p><p>Agatha let out a low chuckle and it was the best thing Rio had heard in days. They sat in silence for a beat, still on the call, until Rio whispered, “I’m so fucking mad at you.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Another moment of silence, but this time it was Agatha who broke it.</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>It only took those three words for Rio’s lacrimal glands to suddenly remember they, too, just like Rio a moment ago, had a mission.</p><p>“I'm even angrier because I miss you too.”</p><p>“Am I seeing you tomorrow?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” She replied, swallowing her tears. Literally.</p><p>“I don’t know how many times I have to say that I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, fingers pulling and twisting the edge of her tank top. “You’ve said it plenty of times.”</p><p>“Yet you still don’t believe me.”</p><p>“I’m starting to. I just don’t think I can trust you again.”</p><p>Agatha sighed on the other end. “Tell me what it takes.”</p><p>Caught completely off guard, Rio opened and closed her mouth a few times, unsure of what to say, before sniffing a disgusting sound into the phone because of her damn runny nose.</p><p>“Sexy.” Agatha commented, pulling a laugh out of Rio, who shook her head and pressed the phone tighter against her cheek.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. What do I need to do for you to believe me? Or trust me?”</p><p>“Honestly? I don’t know.”</p><p>“Can we talk this weekend? Really talk? After I drop Nicky off at his dad’s?”</p><p>See, this is exactly why Rio should’ve never picked up the phone— because she knew nothing good could ever come from hearing Agatha’s voice late at night. She didn’t hesitate to answer, “Yeah.”</p><p>“You’re being real short with your words today. For someone who’s always yapping non-stop.”</p><p>“You’re lucky I haven’t told you to fuck off yet.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, and the sound made Rio smile. “Yes, I’m feeling very fortunate at this moment. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t reply— just the sound of their breathing filling the almost quietness between them for a moment.</p><p>“I’m going to sleep now.” Rio said, lying back down in bed.</p><p>“Good night, Rio.” Agatha muttered back and ended the call.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha’s morning followed the same pattern as the rest of the week, despite running on considerably fewer hours of sleep. She went for her usual morning run, successfully dodged any small talk with Mrs. Hart, took a shower, and got ready for the day as she always did. She woke up Nicky, helped him get ready for school, and made breakfast for both of them. </p><p>Everything exactly as it should be. Routine was a subterfuge for Agatha, something she threw herself into to keep from unraveling.</p><p>After dropping Nicky off at school and heading to work, Agatha was standing in her classroom, waiting for the students to clear out so she could retreat to the professors’ lounge and fix herself a triple espresso. Even after spending extra minutes carefully layering concealer under her eyes, the consecutive days of minimal sleep were clearly taking their toll not only on her appearance but her energy as well.</p><p>Considering she still had a class to teach after her regular schedule— well, maybe it was time to just bring the coffee machine to her office.</p><p>As she impatiently watched the students walk out at a glacial pace, Jennifer Kale walked into the classroom, weaving through the exiting students, wearing an unfriendly expression she seemed to reserve only for Agatha.</p><p>“Harkness.” Jen greeted. “I need to talk to you. Is now a good time?”</p><p>Definitely not.</p><p>“You have ten minutes.”</p><p>“I know your office hours don’t start for another half hour. I was just being polite.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and motioned for Jen to continue. Jen, however, glanced around to make sure no one was within earshot, and the simple gesture made Agatha sick to her stomach.</p><p>“You gave me your word that Vidal wouldn’t be affected.”</p><p>Agatha stood there, agape. She quickly composed herself, but the only thing she managed to say was, “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I have no interest in what’s going on between you two behind closed doors— except I made it clear to you that I didn’t want it to negatively impact one of my best students.”</p><p>“How is any of that your business, Jen?” Agatha asked, keeping her voice low even though, by now, it was just the two of them left. Jen was visibly judging her, as if Agatha needed one more person to look down on her for the terrible decisions she had been making lately.</p><p>“It becomes my business when Vidal approaches me and asks to step down as your assistant, or when she seems so convinced regarding dropping your course. And on top of that, she has barely shown up in the lab this week.”</p><p>Agatha struggled to keep a neutral expression, but clearly failed, as Jen exhaled sharply through her nose and shook her head, muttering under her breath, “Unbelievable.” </p><p>“I’ll talk to her.” Not that Agatha had much of a say in that decision, judging by how Rio had been dodging every one of her attempts to get her ass to sit down and just have a conversation.</p><p>Except for last night, when Rio had agreed they could talk over the weekend. But now, Agatha seriously doubted that plan had ever been made with any real intention of following through. Not after finding out Rio had literally tried to not attend her classes anymore. </p><p>Still, at the moment, she would make any empty promise to end this discussion.</p><p>“You two broke up, then?”</p><p>“Really none of your business.”</p><p>“It's a simple yes or no question, Agatha. I'm not asking for your social security number here.”</p><p>“Fucking noisy— Yes, Jen. The answer is yes.” </p><p>Jen looked thoughtful for a few seconds, staring hard at Agatha, as if some fog that had been clouding her vision suddenly lifted. As if she could now clearly see all the signs that Agatha, too, was going through a breakup. Whether it was in the depths of her eyes, the dark circles under them, the way she leaned heavily against the desk from pure exhaustion, or the lack of sharp retorts she usually fired back so easily.</p><p>Jen sighed. “I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>Agatha hadn't been expecting those words, especially not from Kale. She just nodded, and Jen turned on her heel and left the room, leaving Agatha alone.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha would never admit it, but deep down, she had been holding out hope that Rio would show up before her class. When that didn’t happen, she didn’t just walk to the classroom— she stomped her way there, her heels echoing sharply down the hallway, as if she were trying to leave a dent on the floor.</p><p>William was already there, proactively setting up her laptop, cables, and projector. Fulfilling tasks that weren’t his responsibility, but Rio’s, her TA for that particular course, who wasn’t present.</p><p>Agatha was trying to convince herself she didn’t have the right to feel this frustrated over the very real possibility that Rio had decided to drop the course. Still, why hadn’t she mentioned it on the phone? Agatha had asked her directly, and Rio had confirmed. So why, with less than ten minutes until the beginning of the class, was there still no sign of her?</p><p>She hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath until Rio finally walked into the room, and the tight knots that had been squeezing her chest began to slowly unwind.</p><p>Standing beside the desk, Agatha turned her head slightly toward Rio. When their eyes met, Rio smiled broadly, taking Agatha by surprise with her quiet but affectionate greeting. Too affectionate.</p><p>Agatha squinted, but the distance between her desk and Rio’s chosen row was just enough that her aging eyesight couldn’t quite read the situation. So, despite still only having six minutes before the beginning of her class, she waited until Rio looked her way again and raised her hand, gesturing for her to come over. Entirely within reason, given her role as Agatha’s assistant.</p><p>Rio stood up from her seat, explicitly bewildered, and made her way to the front, moving between a few classmates.  When she stopped in front of Agatha, she looked normal— but not exactly <em> normal </em>.</p><p>“Hi there.” Agatha said, studying her face.</p><p>“Um, hey?” </p><p>“Are you okay?” She scanned her carefully again.</p><p>“Yeah… Are you?”</p><p>“Yes.” </p><p>The exchange was weirder than any conversation they'd had— even before they got involved. Agatha’s blue eyes didn’t leave Rio’s face. And though she really needed to send her back to her seat and start the lecture, impatience was starting prickling under her skin. Something was off.</p><p>Her instincts were confirmed when Rio, completely out of nowhere, let out a deep, unexpected laugh, and immediately slapped a hand over her mouth, her cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p>Agatha glanced around to make sure the students were still distracted with each other, then took half a step closer to Rio— now noticing how her eyes were a little red and her eyelids slightly droopy.</p><p>“You’re high?!”</p><p>With her closed fist resting against her lips in a poor attempt to hide a grin, Rio simply nodded.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Jesus, Rio—“</p><p>“What? I’m feeling… superb.” Rio gave a lazy smile, the gap in her teeth showing, and for a moment, Agatha found herself starting to smile back. Not that any of this was funny— she wanted to strangle Rio on the spot for showing up to class in that state. But damn, that smile…</p><p>“I need to start my class.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move, still staring straight into Agatha’s eyes. Agatha raised her eyebrows. “…Then go back to your seat.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah…” Rio smiled again and lifted her hand, reaching somewhere between Agatha’s neck and cheek, but stopped midway. She abandoned the gesture with her hand hanging in the air. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t flinched, but the almost-display of intimacy in that setting had sent a brief wave of panic through her.</p><p>Rio seemed to realize it too— that they were literally standing in front of enough students for any affectionate moment to be very much noticed. She smiled again, this one far less warm, and walked back to her seat.</p><p>-</p><p>“You have nine days to write this paper. I mentioned it in our very first class, and you received a list of required readings that same day, so I expect nothing less than papers with effective analysis, coherent writing, and clear organization.” Agatha said, hands in the pockets of her blazer as she scanned the room, not focusing on any student in particular. “If you start the readings today, I will know. You’re dismissed.”</p><p>Most of the students got up. To her surprise, the one who approached the front of the room wasn’t Rio, but Alice— her best friend hovering nearby, deliberately avoiding Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“Hey, professor, mind if I talk to you for a sec?” Alice asked. “It’s about the project.”</p><p>Agatha gave a nod, motioning for her to go ahead as she packed up her things in a hurry. Hoping, if she was quick enough, she might get a chance to speak with Rio.</p><p>“I know we agreed I would be responsible for creating the field research questions, but I fear they’re getting too technical, and the general public won’t know how to answer.”</p><p>“How many questions have you come up with so far?”</p><p>“We agreed on fifteen. I’ve written eight.”</p><p>“Finish all fifteen and send them to me so I can review them. I’ll return them to you, and you can make whatever edits are needed.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Do you think it’s better if I email them or come to your office?”</p><p>Email. Always email. Any chance Agatha had to keep her office hours from being overrun, she took it. Unfortunately, though, this was Rio’s best friend, and she knew she needed to earn points wherever she could. </p><p>So instead, she found herself saying, “Come to my office. That way we can discuss any changes if necessary.”</p><p>Alice smiled brightly and thanked her before returning to where Rio was standing. Rio mumbled something Agatha couldn’t understand, but Alice quickly left the room, leaving Agatha and Rio alone.</p><p>Rio approached the desk where Agatha stood, finishing packing her things into her bag. Before she could say anything, Agatha spoke, her gaze still on her materials.</p><p>“Why did you feel the need to come to my class high?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a few seconds. “Because I knew it would be hard to sit through hours of watching you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands froze for a moment, feeling unsure whether that was supposed to sound as harsh as it did. When she resumed her task, her face was twisted in a scowl.</p><p>Noticing Agatha wouldn’t answer, Rio stepped closer to the desk, placing her hands on its edge. “I’m almost done with the reading list.”</p><p>“Good.” </p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Do you want to drop this course? Because if you’re that determined not to watch my class, I can find a way to remove you without it affecting your academic record.”</p><p>Rio was taken aback, her brown eyes widening for a second. “Why are you saying that?” She questioned, then immediately guessing the only person who could have told Agatha. “Kale told you? Shit— That was earlier this week. I don’t want that anymore.”</p><p>Agatha zipped up her bag and placed both hands on top of it, lifting her gaze to meet Rio’s. “So what do you want, Rio?”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together and spoke, her voice a decibel lower, “I don’t know.”</p><p>“I told you before, and I’ll say it again: tell me what it takes for you to trust me again.”</p><p>“It’s not that simple, Agatha. I can’t just snap my fingers and start believing you again. Trusting you.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, holding her tongue to keep from saying to Rio that she hadn’t killed or stabbed anyone, or anything that would require such exaggeration on her part. Yes, she had lied, and not for the first time— but Agatha was willing to make things right. How she would do that, though, was another story, especially since if she said the sky was blue, Rio would probably find a way to doubt it.</p><p>“Nicky’s sleeping at Wanda’s. Why don’t you come to my house? I’ll order a pizza, and we can talk.”</p><p>She saw the hesitation in Rio’s eyes and knew the answer before she even opened her mouth.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p><p>Agatha scratched the tip of her nose, visibly irritated by the fact that Rio had built walls so thick around herself that not even a sledgehammer would make a dent.</p><p>“Rio, am I wasting my time here? Because—“</p><p>The classroom door opened, drawing both women’s attention, and Alice walked in with an embarrassed look while Yelena was clearly set on making an entrance. And she did.</p><p>“Rio, whatever you had to do to get an A+, you did. Let’s go.” Yelena said, practically yelling even though the distance didn’t call for such volume. </p><p>Agatha’s expression darkened, both at the innuendo and the interruption. She was more than familiar with Yelena’s kind of humor, but that was definitely not the place or time for it. She turned back to Rio, who, despite her initial grimace, surprised Agatha by simply responding, “I’ll be right there.”</p><p>Yelena gave her a thumbs up and walked out with Alice, deliberately leaving the door ajar.</p><p>Rio returned her gaze to Agatha, who had her lips pressed together and looked close to hostile.</p><p>“Call me when you drop Nicky off at his dad’s.” </p><p>First Rio hadn’t bothered to see her before class, and now she was actively turning down Agatha’s invitation? To her face?</p><p>Agatha chose not to respond because she knew anything she said would do more harm than good. Instead, she silently nodded and swung her bag over her shoulder, heading for the back door of the classroom.</p><p>With her back to Rio, she paused for a moment to fish her car keys out of her bag when she felt the tips of Rio’s fingers graze the length of her hair, brushing lightly down her spine.</p><p>Every inch of Agatha’s skin lit up at the contact, and she instinctively tilted her head back just slightly, chasing the touch, her abdomen tightening as her mouth released a sound— something alarmingly close to a moan.</p><p>Always proud to say she was self-sufficient in every aspect of her life, Agatha Harkness didn’t seem to be living up to that standard quite as well as she thought— if a mere touch like that could already turn her into a puddle of neediness.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tangled briefly in a few strands of Agatha’s hair. Agatha remained completely still, afraid of breaking the moment. But then Rio pulled her hand back, even as Agatha held her breath to keep her from doing it.</p><p>Agatha spun around and took a single step to position herself directly before Rio, who gazed at her with a mixture of uncertainty and affection. Her eyes welled with tears almost instantly, and just like every other time Rio had cried or come close to it, in front of her, Agatha felt her heart ache like it had been struck with a thousand cuts.</p><p>Her frustration about the declined invitation, about Yelena’s interruption… None of it mattered as she reached up, placed a hand on the back of Rio’s neck, and pulled her into a hug. Rio accepted it without a second thought.</p><p>Slightly taller than Rio thanks to her heels, Agatha lowered her head and breathed her in: her conditioner, her perfume, even a lingering trace of pot. She felt Rio press her nose against her neck, her warm breath grazing her skin.</p><p>They held each other in silence for a few more seconds before they both stepped back at the same time.</p><p>Rio's cheeks were smeared with tears, which Agatha cupped and tenderly wiped away with her thumb. What she really wanted, though, was to be wiping them away with her lips, kissing that face she had missed more than she would ever admit, even to herself.</p><p>When Agatha leaned in, aiming for Rio’s lips, the student subtly tilted her head back, causing Agatha to freeze immediately.</p><p>“I’ll see you this Sunday, okay?” </p><p>Agatha bit her bottom lip and pulled back entirely, letting her hand fall from Rio’s face. “Okay.”</p><p>In a movement so quick Agatha almost doubted it had actually happened, Rio inclined her face and kissed the professor’s cheek before stepping away again and walking out of the classroom.</p><p>Agatha took three deep breaths in a mix of frustration and longing in her chest. She grabbed her phone and quickly typed out a text to Wanda.</p><p>-</p><p>A few hours later, Agatha had her belly full, sitting on the couch in Wanda’s living room, trying not to spill the wine from the glass in her hand. The three kids were running back and forth through the downstairs rooms, and every time they, for some reason, thought it was an outstanding idea to do some kind of parkour through the living room, Nicky made a point of jumping over Agatha’s lap, nearly kicking or bumping his head on her wine glass.</p><p>Vision was nowhere to be found— Wanda had mentioned that he’d been babysitting the kids since they got back from school, and, on that particular day, none of them had given him a moment of peace, to the point where even Vision’s endless patience was hanging by a thread.</p><p>When Agatha had texted the redhead back on campus, it was with the intention of venting about what was going on between her and Rio. However, up until now, she hadn’t even managed to bring up Rio Vidal, because those three gremlins had made it their ultimate goal to use Agatha and Wanda as parkour obstacles. ‘Parkour’ might even be too generous a word, considering Billy had already fallen flat on his back trying to climb over the couch from behind it, and Nicky had managed to kick Agatha in the ribs during one of his attempts to leap over her.</p><p>“Boys! That’s enough jumping and running around the house!” Wanda scolded them, to no avail. The twins were already laughing in the kitchen, and Nicky was about to join them— he jumped off the couch and nearly landed on Wanda’s coffee table in the center of the living room rug.</p><p>“Nicholas!” Agatha snapped in full mom-voice mode, which had an immediate effect: Nicky froze before even leaving the living room. Wanda tried not to laugh, and Agatha handed her the wine glass before getting up and walking over to him.</p><p>She knelt down so she was at eye level with him.</p><p>“Are you going to stop running around the house or are we going home?” If Nicky answered the second option, Agatha was going to be so pissed.</p><p>“I’ll stop, mom, sorry. It’s just… There’s nothing to do. I forgot my Nintendo at home and I don’t want to just sit and watch them play. It’s so boring.”</p><p>“Are those really the only two options? Play Nintendo or run around and jump on everything? Maybe I should give away all those toys of yours then—“</p><p>“No, mom!”</p><p>“Then find something else to do with the twins. They’ve got a whole room full of toys. There has to be something in there you guys can play together.”</p><p>Nicky pouted, his sweaty forehead scrunched in frustration. Agatha wiped the look off his face with her thumb, along with the sweat running down the side of it.</p><p>“Nicky, toys with the twins or we’re going home. What’s it gonna be?”</p><p>“Toys.”</p><p>“Go on then.”</p><p>Nicky began to sprint toward the boys, but common sense quickly warned him what a terrible idea that would be. He glanced sideways and caught Agatha’s stern look. He gave a sheepish grin and walked to the kitchen instead.</p><p>“I wish I had that kind of authority with the boys too.” Wanda said as Agatha sat back down on the couch and reached out for her wine glass.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You’re outnumbered.”</p><p>The redhead grinned and got more comfortable on her end of the couch, eyeing Agatha curiously. Agatha, sitting on the other end, looked uneasy. </p><p>“…So?”</p><p>“I fucked up.”</p><p>“Let me guess… Vidal?”</p><p>There was no reason for Agatha to dance around the subject, so she did something she hadn’t done since her fight with Paul— she opened up to someone. From the encounter at McDonald’s to just a few hours earlier in the classroom, Agatha told Wanda everything. The fights, the lies, the reasons why she thought she had the right to keep so much from Rio… All of it.</p><p>Back when the vent had been about her ugly fight with Paul, Rio, always attentive and caring, had held her hand several times and comforted her in a way Agatha hadn’t allowed herself to be comforted in years.</p><p>Obviously, she didn’t expect anything remotely similar from Wanda. Even though they’d been friends for decades, Agatha wasn’t physically affectionate with anyone other than Nicky and, well… Rio. </p><p>Still, she definitely hadn’t expected Wanda’s reaction to be so… </p><p>“You’re such a moron.”</p><p>Baffled, Agatha stared at Wanda as if she had just said something by mistake and would correct herself any second. That moment never came.</p><p>“Say again?”</p><p>“Agatha, you’ve been single for years, okay— but the basics haven’t changed. Lying and hiding things from your partner is still a big no-no.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at Wanda’s mocking tone.</p><p>“You didn’t see her having a full-blown jealous meltdown, Wanda—“</p><p>“I saw you and Gulliver chasing after her at the bar that night. And what did you do? You fucked her in the bathroom stall. Seemed more like a reward for her behavior than a reprimand, but hey…”</p><p>Agatha let out an ironic laugh, completely disagreeing with Wanda’s implication. “A reward? She’s not a dog.”</p><p>“You don’t get to complain about her outbursts and then downplay it. You didn’t want to face her jealousy, and how did that work out for you, Agatha? You should’ve told her about meeting Nat instead of hiding it and letting it blow up in your face.”</p><p>There were so many hard truths being thrown at her that Agatha didn’t even know how to answer. So she deflected.</p><p>“You say that now, but you were the first one to tell me I should fuck Natasha when she showed up in Westview.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes went wide and she straightened up on the couch. “How was I supposed to know you and Vidal were serious? You keep that girl so hidden!”</p><p>“Don’t call her a girl, Wanda, Jesus—” Agatha pressed her lips together. “It’s bad enough I already feel like a predator.”</p><p>The redhead snorted, and the way she laughed it off annoyed Agatha. She narrowed her eyes at her.</p><p>“I’m being fucking serious. If I’d gotten involved with someone my own age, I wouldn’t be dealing with this shit.”</p><p>“In order to do that, you’d have to make the bare minimum effort to meet someone our age, which, let’s be real, I don’t see happening… And if you’re aiming for someone older— Well, better check the visiting hours at the retirement home.”</p><p>Okay, that’s it. Agatha set her wine glass down on the coffee table and was about to stand up when Wanda, laughing, grabbed her arm to stop her.</p><p>“I’m kidding, I’m kidding—“</p><p>“Can you be serious for a second, Wanda? Holy shit.”</p><p>Wanda had tears in her eyes from laughing, but to her credit, she was clearly trying to reel it back in.</p><p>“All jokes aside, I don’t think Rio’s age made as much of a difference as you think it did.” When Agatha opened her mouth to argue, Wanda cut her off, “Agatha, you lied. You withheld things. Then you lied again. Do you really not see the problem here? The poor girl—woman, she’s in love with you, and you were sneaking around.”</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated breath and picked up her wine glass again after Wanda refilled it. “I didn’t realize the… Depth, of her feelings for me.”</p><p>“That’s a sad excuse. And even so, you never suspected?”</p><p>There was that one time Rio had called her ‘love’ during sex, something Agatha had completely ignored, and Rio had never said again. However, was that really enough for Agatha to assume Rio truly loved her? Couldn’t it have just been something said in the heat of the moment? A word that slipped out from pure lust?</p><p>“Maybe a little. I don’t fucking know, Wanda.” Agatha took a sip of wine and spoke again, her voice tinged with sadness, “I think Rio believes that nothing happened between me and Natasha, but she says she doesn't trust me. I know she has this right. I’ve already asked what I can do to fix that, and she won’t tell me. One minute she’s avoiding me like the plague, the next she seems like she’s softening.”</p><p>Wanda looked at her with an expression of understanding and tenderness, and her next words, though spoken gently, startled Agatha.</p><p>“I don’t think Vidal was the only one feeling love in this story.”</p><p>Agatha? In love with her student, someone many years younger than her? Nope. Wanda had it all wrong. Again.</p><p>“What? I’m not in love with Rio.”</p><p>Wanda opened and closed her mouth a few times.</p><p>“You’re not?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Wanda rubbed her temples— a habit she had picked up from Agatha after so many years of friendship.</p><p>“Fine, you’re not in love with her. Then why are you so desperate to get her back, Agatha? Just leave the poor woman alone.”</p><p>No, she couldn’t do that either. “I can’t.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her. “Why not, Agatha?”</p><p>“I fucking miss her, okay? It got to the point where she was sleeping in my bed almost every night Nicky wasn’t at home. Or I was sleeping at her place. You do realize she shares an apartment with Gulliver? And I was just there, with them? Two students? Still I got used to it because of her.” Agatha said, hands flying as she spoke, nearly spilling her wine. “Do I have to be in love with her to want her back?”</p><p>She was genuinely afraid of Wanda’s answer, but the redhead only smiled at her sympathetically. </p><p>“Of course not. However… I’ve known you long enough to tell you, in my opinion, you’re just being stubborn.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Wanda let out a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “I think what Vidal wants is for you to actually own up to how badly you messed things up with her. And let’s be real, Agatha… Admit the obvious. What you two had was never casual. After everything you told me today, I’m shocked you ever believed it was.”</p><p>“What’s hard to believe is how I managed to fuck things up this bad, holy fucking christ.” Agatha muttered, finishing off her glass of wine. </p><p>“You’ve got a chance to make it right with her in a few days, honey.”</p><p>Agatha nodded just as Tommy reappeared in the living room, this time alone.</p><p>“Auntie Agatha, Nicky fell asleep upstairs.” He said, then turned to Wanda. “Billy too.”</p><p>Jesus, what time was it? Agatha’s eyes widened as she checked her watch and realized she’d been venting with Wanda for hours— way past Nicky’s bedtime. She thanked Tommy for the heads-up, and once the boy disappeared back upstairs, Agatha got up from the couch.</p><p>“I’m going to get Nicky.”</p><p>“Good luck with Vidal. And Agatha— Be patient, okay? It’s obvious you care about her, so don’t let your stubbornness or pride get in the way.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t say the word love again, but the way she pressed her lips into a knowing little smile said enough. Agatha bit her lip and nodded again, giving her best friend a quick, rare hug.</p><p>-</p><p>With Nicky tucked into his bed, Agatha was lying in hers, mindlessly scrolling through her phone. It was already a given that she wouldn’t be getting much sleep that night, but ever since she and Rio started following each other on instagram —Rio had requested to follow her again after their phone call the day before— Agatha had found herself substantially more interested in the app.</p><p>Coincidentally, when she opened it, Rio’s profile picture lit up at the top of her screen. She started tapping through the stories Rio had posted in the last hour: blurry shots of a table crowded with empty beer bottles, a photo of Rio aiming a dart at the camera, then three photos of Rio with Yelena, the blonde’s hand gripping her waist as the two laughed. There were more pictures, some with Gulliver and others featuring people Agatha didn’t recognize.</p><p>The damn photos appeared and disappeared very quickly, and Agatha squinted, trying to absorb as much detail as the few seconds would allow. None of her conclusions were welcoming at all. </p><p>-</p><p>The days leading up to Sunday followed the same routine, but time felt completely different. When Agatha finally dropped Nicky off at Paul’s —whom she now only spoke to when absolutely necessary and had zero intention of apologizing to, not for her words, and certainly not for the backpack she’d thrown at him— Agatha sent Rio a simple text to let her know Nicky was no longer with her.</p><p>Rio replied with the location of a cafe near her apartment, and that’s where Agatha was now headed, her hands steady on the steering wheel, her mind replaying all the damn pictures she’d had to see of Rio over the last few days. </p><p>Was that why Rio wanted them to follow each other on instagram? Just to rub it in Agatha’s face that her life hadn’t changed at all, regardless of what had happened between them? That just like she was a party girl before Agatha, Rio slipped right back into it, and Agatha be damned for screwing everything up between them?</p><p>Breathing deeply through her nose, Agatha walked into the coffee shop, and her eyes found Rio almost instantly, already sitting comfortably at a table.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio smiled as soon as Agatha approached.</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod, slipping off her coat and draping it over the back of her chair— choosing to ignore the way Rio’s eyes roamed over her body before returning to her face.</p><p>She sat down across from Rio, still silent, and Rio raised an eyebrow. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha placed her hand on the table, tapping her nails against the surface as her eyes studied Rio. A few seconds later, she murmured, locking eyes with her. </p><p>“What exactly do you want from me, Vidal?”</p><p> </p>

<em> “What exactly do you want from me, Vidal?” </em>
</p><p>Agatha watched Rio’s three reactions unfold in slow motion. First, amusement, probably thinking Agatha was setting up some kind of joke by calling her by her last name. Second, confusion, because Agatha’s serious expression ruled the first one out. And third, anger, when she realized Agatha was actually expecting an answer from her.</p><p>Throughout those few seconds, the only sound between them was Agatha’s nails tapping against the table as she stared at Rio.</p><p>“What do you mean, Agatha?”</p><p>“My question was clear. What do you want from me?”</p><p>Rio poked her tongue against the inside of her cheek, glancing around the coffee shop in a slow 180 before turning her gaze back to Agatha.</p><p>“What I want is to talk to you. A real conversation. You know, the kind you asked us to have a million times. And now you show up like this.” She raised her hand, gesturing vaguely at Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha’s restless fingers only stilled when Rio placed her hand over hers, pressing her palm flat against the table. “What the hell is going on, Agatha?”</p><p>The professor glanced down at their hands, then exhaled, bringing her eyes back to Rio’s face.</p><p>“Were you trying to make me jealous?”</p><p>Out of all the possibilities running through Rio’s mind, it was clear that Agatha’s question was not among the top 100.</p><p>“What? When?" She asked, her brow furrowed.</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>“No— You don’t get to do that!”</p><p>Fucking big mouth of hers.</p><p>In the big picture, Rio had a point: she was there because Agatha had insisted —repeatedly, for days— and now Agatha showed up like she wanted to throw tables and chairs through the window. And by asking if Rio had tried to make her jealous, paired with her current bitchy mode, she’d basically handed Rio the win, whether or not that had even been the plan. </p><p>Rio pulled her hand away and crossed her arms. Agatha mirrored her.</p><p>“Agatha, either you explain why you’re acting like this or I’m leaving. I mean it.”</p><p>She didn’t mean it.</p><p>At least, Agatha thought she didn’t, until Rio huffed and actually started to stand, stopping halfway between seated and upright when Agatha blurted out a sharp “No!” and reached out to grab her arm.</p><p>Rio sat back down, raising her eyebrows, waiting for Agatha to spill.</p><p>Agatha ran the tip of her tongue across her lips. “I honestly want to talk to you. Lay it all out.”</p><p>Rio puffed. “You’re not getting off that easy. Why would I try to make you jealous?”</p><p>Fucking brat.</p><p>“Fuck—“ Agatha whispered under her breath. “Because you wanted me to follow you on instagram so I could see those pictures of you all over other people. Pretty juvenile behavior, to say the least.” Agatha wasn’t about to admit that what really got under her skin were the pictures of Rio with Yelena, or <em> babe </em>, as Rio liked to call her. </p><p>“That made you jealous?” Rio asked with a cocky smile, causing more turmoil in Agatha for being forced to admit a feeling so… Definitely not fitting for someone her age.</p><p>However, she wasn’t going to lie to Rio again— lesson learned. So she muttered, her voice tight, “Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s wide grin, complete with that adorable gap in her teeth, spread across her face while Agatha sulked. Noticing Agatha’s lingering grumpiness, Rio softened her tone. “First of all, I didn’t do that. Not on purpose. And second, I haven’t been with anyone.”</p><p>Agatha was finally able to fill her lungs for the first time since she’d opened that damn app— one she had already decided to delete depending on how this conversation with Rio went.</p><p>“Not for lack of people wanting you, I bet.” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow at Rio.</p><p>To Agatha, it was obvious— Rio was the most interesting student (and person, for that matter) on that campus. And that was saying something, considering the countless students Agatha had met and worked with over her years of teaching at the university. If Rio managed to charm her… No other student, or god forbid, professor, stood a chance of resisting her.</p><p>Rio gave her a half-smile. “I told you a while ago… You’ve got me on the shortest leash possible. That hasn’t changed.”</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>“You?” Rio asked, and Agatha frowned, momentarily confused. “Has she tried to reach out?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “She called me that night, and I blocked her number. Something I should’ve done from the start.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you?” Rio asked. “You freaked out when she showed up at that gathering at Professor Kale’s. Didn’t look like you wanted anything to do with her.”</p><p>Agatha knew she needed to come clean with Rio about everything that had happened with Natasha, especially the parts she’d worked hard to keep off Rio’s radar. But admitting that Natasha had played her, managing to get her to meet up under the pretense of talking —only to clearly have other intentions— was another hit to Agatha’s pride.</p><p>In order to be truthful, she needed to give some background on why she had insisted on talking to Natasha in the first place. Not that she would go into detail… She was there to try and fix things with Rio, not to stand around rambling about her fucking ex.</p><p>“Rio, the last time I saw her before that day was during a stupid fight in our apartment. She left to spend the night somewhere else and promised we’d talk the next day, only that talk never happened. That was nine years ago. Wouldn’t <em> you </em>want some kind of clarification?”</p><p>Rio thought for a few seconds, then gave a firm shake of her head. “After all that time? Honestly, I don’t think I would.” She pressed her lips together as she noticed Agatha’s reaction. “It’s just... it’s so obvious to me that she doesn’t deserve your time. But I get it, Agatha. And it hurts that you thought I wouldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hand from her forehead to the top of her head, brushing her hair back from her face. “I’m sorry, I really am.” She gave a sad smile. “Besides wanting to have that conversation, she also threatened to show up at the university, and then at my house.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw visibly tightened at that. “You should have told me.”</p><p>“You would have stormed into that hotel and kicked the door down. We both know that. And I didn’t want to make things worse. I really thought it was possible to just talk to her, like two adults, and finally put it all behind me.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at that first part, but even she knew there was no arguing with the kind of jealous rage she felt, so she let it go and shifted the conversation to the one question Agatha had known was coming, and frankly, dreaded.</p><p>“How did that hotel card end up in your office?”</p><p>Fuck. Agatha clicked her tongue, mentally bracing for what would come once she answered.</p><p>“Do you remember that day we went to McDonald’s?”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“I ran into her there. And she gave it to me.” Yes, better to keep it brief.</p><p>Rio’s amber eyes looked like they might burn a hole straight through Agatha’s blue ones, and at that point, her jaw must’ve been aching from how hard she was clenching it.</p><p>“Did you guys talk?”</p><p>“Well, kind of. She said a bunch of shit, asked me out, I turned her down, she gave me the card, and that was it.”</p><p>Rio gave her a suspicious look. “What kind of shit?”</p><p>“Rio… Don’t make me say it.”</p><p>“What kind of shit, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lower lip, taking in deep breaths because as much as she knew this conversation would be bad, she hadn’t expected it to be <em> this </em> bad.</p><p>“I told her I wouldn’t go out with her, and she realized it was probably because I was seeing someone, and…”</p><p>Rio kept staring at her, waiting for her to finish. Fucking christ.</p><p>“And she said that when I got tired of whoever I was with, I should look her up, that she still remembered… how I like it.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared. “Let me get this straight. While I was sitting in your car, waiting for you to pick up our food, your ex was offering you sex? And you got back in the car and didn’t tell me a fucking word?!”</p><p>Okay, yeah… Hearing it like that, it really did sound terrible. However, Agatha had made the choice to keep it to herself in the few minutes she had between walking out of that McDonald’s and getting into the car. It wasn’t enough time to fully think through her options or the consequences.</p><p>With Natasha, avoiding conflict had always been the safest route— every argument derailed fast, and before either of them realized, the apartment would be filled with shouting and accusations for hours, sometimes days. Years of that pattern, combined with Rio’s jealousy, made Agatha feel like silence was her only option in that moment. Of course, now she could see the exact second her stupid logic fell apart. </p><p>“I know I should have.”</p><p>“Yes, you fucking should have! You lied to my face!” Rio’s raised voice grew louder, and Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, fully aware there was no escaping Rio’s anger now.</p><p>She hadn’t lied. She had just omitted. Not that that technicality was going to help her much. Before Agatha could even try to defend herself, Rio was talking again, her voice still sharp and heated.</p><p>“I didn’t want to believe you could have lied to me more than once, but you did. Repeatedly, apparently. Fuck, I’m such a fucking idiot—“</p><p>“I swear those were the only two times! Rio, please.”</p><p>Rio looked like she was on the verge of crying, and Agatha could see the effort it took for her not to do it in public, which only made the professor more desperate. “I didn’t lie because I had some ulterior motive, I <em> swear </em>. I just didn’t want to make things worse between us. Which is fucking ironic, considering everything that happened— but baby, I’m so fucking sorry.”</p><p>“You don’t get to call me that, Agatha. Not after everything you’ve done! I have zero reason to trust you.” A few tears managed to slip out, which only seemed to make Rio even angrier. “We’re so done here.”</p><p>The nausea those last words triggered in Agatha made her press her lips tightly together, genuinely afraid she might end up throwing up her lunch all over the coffee shop table. Her silence said it all. Or rather, it was the lack of any attempt to make Rio stay that made the younger woman push back her chair and walk out, leaving Agatha alone at the table with the taste of bile rising in her throat.</p><p>-</p><p>“Rio, open this fucking door!” </p><p>Definitely not at her best —and making a solid effort to be at her worst— Agatha had her fist pounding on Rio’s apartment door. The nausea had passed, thanks to throwing up in the coffee shop bathroom right after Rio stormed out. At least she’d chewed a mint gum on the drive over, violating more traffic laws than someone with a law degree should have, on her way to Rio’s building.</p><p>Pretty soon, the rings on her fingers would leave marks on the wooden door, and Agatha couldn’t care less. She kept banging until the door finally opened, revealing Alice, eyes wide and startled as she stared at Agatha’s raised arm, mid-swing for another knock.</p><p>“Is she here?” Agatha already knew the answer— she’d seen Rio’s car parked out front.</p><p>“She doesn’t wanna talk to anyone.” Alice replied in a near whisper, clearly spooked by seeing Professor Agatha Harkness in such a state at their door.</p><p>“That’s not what I asked.” Agatha said in a sharp tone.</p><p>“She is here.” </p><p>The door wasn’t fully open, and Alice was standing in the only space that kept Agatha from stepping inside. The professor exhaled through her nose, fixing Alice with a stare so intense it only took about three seconds of those icy blue eyes boring into her before Alice moved aside and opened the door completely.</p><p>Agatha stormed into the apartment with the grace of a hurricane ripping through homes and bridges, and judging by the tension radiating off her entire body, that was exactly the kind of fear she instilled in Gulliver, who quickly shut the door and trailed after her— though wisely keeping a safe distance.</p><p>Without even bothering to be polite, Agatha flung open Rio's bedroom door. Rio, who had been sitting on her bed, jumped back at the unexpected intrusion.</p><p>“What the fuck? <em> Alice </em>!” Rio spoke in a high-pitched voice, startled, while Alice hovered behind Agatha near the door.</p><p>“She’s fucking scary, okay!” Alice said in a half-whispered apology, still unsure if leaving the two of them alone was a good idea. But she didn’t really have a choice— Agatha turned around and shut the door in her face.</p><p>Agatha faced the bed again, where Rio was still sitting. Her eyes were red and puffy, and for a brief second, it almost made Agatha abandon the entire speech she’d been rehearsing on the drive over. Almost.</p><p>“You wanted honesty, didn’t you? Isn’t that what you asked for? I was honest with you. I know I fucked up, badly, and I’m standing here, owning it. I know that doesn’t make me some kind of martyr, and believe me, I wouldn’t be here, literally barging into your apartment, if I didn’t care so fucking much about you!”</p><p>Rio pushed herself forward, now on her knees on the bed, and raised her arm, finger pointed at Agatha, who still stood in the middle of the room. “Since when do you care about me? About us? You’re the one who said we were casual! So, casually, Agatha, get the fuck out!”</p><p>Not a chance. Wanda’s voice, accusing her of being in love with Rio, echoed at full volume in her head, and she shook it off— shaking her head repeatedly, both at the phantom voice and at Rio’s demand that she leave.</p><p>“I care so fucking much.” Agatha said, her breathing uneven. “I see it now. I never should’ve said it was casual, that day.”</p><p>“You’re just saying that for the sake of it.”</p><p>“No, I’m not.” Agatha took a step closer to the bed. “I care about you so much, Rio— fuck.” Her eyes welled up and she tilted her head back, hoping gravity might drag the tears back where they came from. “I want you back.” She said, lowering her gaze to meet Rio’s.</p><p>The gravitational strategy did not work. By that point, Rio was crying on her knees atop the mattress, and Agatha stood at the foot of the bed, tears rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>“You could’ve always been honest with me, Agatha. I know I get jealous, I know I’m territorial when it comes to you, but all I ever asked for was honesty. Communication. And you failed at both.”</p><p>“I’m doing that now.”</p><p>“Exactly— Now. And what’s to say this pattern won’t repeat itself? If your ex or Danvers tries something again next week, how do I know you won’t lie, or hide it from me?”</p><p>Agatha let out a sigh and took a chance, sitting down at the edge of the bed— still keeping a respectful distance from Rio. Rio didn’t seem bothered by how close she was, but she didn’t move any closer either.</p><p>“I’m not going to make the same mistake again. And they won’t.”</p><p>Rio let out a bitter laugh. “Oh yeah? That’s what I believed too. But as long as you’re a fucking hot, available woman— Agatha, I’ve got classmates, guys and girls, who’ve openly said they want to stop by your office, and you’re not even their professor.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed at that, because honestly, she’d kick anyone out of her office unless they had a damn good reason to be there. But she knew Rio wouldn’t appreciate a joke right now, so she swallowed the laugh and took a deep breath.</p><p>Her stomach twisted at the next thing she was about to say. She knew it was a long shot, but come on, she was desperate. “What if I wasn’t available?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You know.”</p><p>“No, I really don’t, Agatha. You’ve always made it clear that people couldn’t know about us. So what, now it’s suddenly fine?”</p><p>Fuck, Rio was being difficult. </p><p>Agatha had considered just casually dropping it, maybe around one of the university’s notoriously chatty professors, that she was in a relationship. Given it would be the first time <em> ever </em> that Agatha Harkness was officially committed to someone, she knew that kind of gossip would spread like wildfire, among students and staff alike.</p><p>“No— Look, I can’t make us official at the university. Not while this course is still going and you’re my student. But I can make it clear that I’m not available. To anyone who asks or tries anything.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, searching for any sign that Agatha was fucking with her. But Agatha wasn’t, and when Rio finally gave up trying to catch her in a lie, she crossed her arms and sat back down on the mattress.</p><p>“Why should I believe you now?”</p><p>Agatha moved closer, and to her relief, Rio didn’t flinch. “You know me, Rio.” When the student started to shake her head in protest, Agatha reached out and rested her hand on Rio’s knee. “Yes, you do. You <em> know </em> you do. You know I never would’ve shown up at a student’s apartment, especially one who lives with another one of my students, who is working on a project with me, if I wasn’t dead serious about what I want here.”</p><p>Rio poked her cheek with her tongue.</p><p>“I said I want you back, and I mean it.” Agatha swallowed hard. “I like you a lot, Rio. And I care deeply about you. You <em> have </em> to know that.” She tightened her grip on Rio’s knee, watching as the girl’s eyes began to fill with tears again.</p><p>“This time has to be different, Agatha. I’m not going to feel like your fuck toy again— I don’t think I would survive that a second time.”</p><p>“You were never that to me.”</p><p>“Doesn’t change the fact that that’s exactly how I felt.”</p><p>“Okay, fine… What do you mean by different?”</p><p>“If— <em> If, </em>we get back together, you’re going to treat me like a girlfriend. Not someone sneaking into your house just so you can fuck. And you’re not going to make that face when we’re here with Alice— That face right there!”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized it, but her expression had twisted at Rio’s words. Her brows were nearly fused together, her forehead scrunched in a way that emphasized the lines she usually worked hard not to show. And of course, her eyes were narrowed in blatant disdain, leaving zero doubt about what she thought of what she was hearing.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and smoothed her forehead with her thumb, which actually made Rio let out a real laugh— for the first time in days. </p><p>A step forward, if you asked Agatha. </p><p>“I will only agree to come here if it is just Gulliver. I'm not going to be blindsided by Will again like that— and god forbid another student sees me here.” Agatha had been mortified when she woke up to find no one other than her assistant watching her sleep, and the only reason she didn’t shoot off that couch and never return was sheer willpower. She probably wouldn’t handle it as gracefully if it ever happened again.</p><p>“Fair… What about your son?”</p><p>“What about him?”</p><p>“Am I still going to be banned from your house for half the month? That’s not how relationships work, Agatha.”</p><p>Well, she had a point. Not one Agatha particularly liked, but a point nonetheless. She had never introduced anyone to Nicky— not that she’d had any reason to during his eight years of life. As far as he knew, his mom might as well have been a nun. Minus the whole going-to-church, believing-in-God, and praying…</p><p>“I need time to tell him.”</p><p>Rio did not look convinced.</p><p>“Rio, it’s always been just me and him, his entire life. And he already knows you, so of course you’re welcome when he’s with me, I just... Need some time to explain our relationship to him.”</p><p>“So no French kissing in front of him?” Rio asked, her lips curling into a smile.</p><p>Agatha laughed and shook her head. “In front of anyone, for that matter.”</p><p>Rio pouted. “Not even at the festival I already bought tickets for? I got one for Alice too, but she’s gonna love knowing I’m giving hers to you instead.”</p><p>Festival? Agatha’s eyebrow arched, unsure what to ask first— genuinely afraid of the answer. But again, she was trying here. “What festival? And why would I want to go if even your best friend, who's your age, doesn’t?”</p><p>Rio looked excited, leaning forward toward Agatha until her folded knees were nearly resting on Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>“Westview Fest?”</p><p>“That a question or an answer?”</p><p>“Sometimes I forget how old you are— It’s a music festival. Next Saturday.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the age jab and pushed on. “And Gulliver doesn’t want to go because…”</p><p>“It’s not really her vibe.”</p><p>“And it’s mine?” </p><p>“Definitely not. But as my girlfriend, like you said yourself, you have to go with me.”</p><p>Okay, Agatha knew making a few compromises was in her future— the one she definitely wanted Rio to be part of. Of course, going to a festival hadn’t been on her list of compromises. But if she must look at the silver lining, Rio was actually thinking about plans where they were together, as a couple, and that made it a little easier for Agatha to breathe. </p><p>“And when I, playing the role of your girlfriend, run into half of my students at this festival, then what?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Some accessories, sunglasses… We’ll figure it out.”</p><p>Not a solid plan, not even close, but that was next Saturday Agatha’s problem. Right now, she needed to make sure there was even a problem left to solve besides making things right with Rio.</p><p>When Rio noticed the smile forming on Agatha’s lips, she brought her hand to Agatha’s neck, leaning in until their faces were only inches apart. “I’ve missed you so fucking much.”</p><p>Agatha should have thought this through before —definitely not when Rio’s lips were this close— but against her own will, she pulled back. Rio opened her eyes again, disappointed.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t want to— Fuck, I just need a toothbrush.” Agatha said, catching the confused look on Rio’s face. “Tell me you didn’t throw out the one I left here?”</p><p>“Maybe I threw it out in a fit of rage… Come on, Agatha, just kiss me already.”</p><p>Rio leaned in again, but Agatha pulled back once more, earning a frustrated sigh.</p><p>“Do you have a spare one?”</p><p>Rio huffed even louder. “No, Agatha.”</p><p>There was absolutely no way Agatha was kissing her just a few hours after she had thrown up— non-negotiable. Instead, the professor cupped Rio’s face with both hands and leaned in to kiss her forehead.</p><p>“I’m gonna head out, grab us something to eat, and pick up what I need, okay?”</p><p>“Agathaaa—“</p><p>“I’ll be right back, baby.”</p><p>-</p><p>Just over an hour later, Agatha was knocking on the apartment door again, much more civilized this time. Rio opened it with a smile that nearly melted Agatha on the spot.</p><p>“You didn’t forget I don’t live alone and brought food for three, right?” Rio asked as Agatha walked in with two takeout bags and set them down on the kitchen counter.</p><p>“No. Now, if you’ll excuse me.” Agatha turned on her heel and made her way to the bathroom.</p><p>By the time she returned, Rio was finishing setting out the many containers of Italian food Agatha had brought, along with some plates and utensils.</p><p>“I live with one other person, not five. You bought enough food to feed a small army.” Rio said, unaware of the confident steps Agatha was taking toward her until the professor’s hands gripped her waist and turned her around.</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her a chance for any more smart-ass remarks and crashed her lips against hers. She wouldn’t be melodramatic and say out loud just how much the absence of those lips had carved a hole in her chest these past few days. But she also couldn’t deny the way her heart leapt when she daringly ran her tongue along Rio’s lips— lips that parted instantly, allowing Agatha to claim her mouth without hesitation.</p><p>Rio’s hands tangled in her hair (of course they did), and Agatha pinned her against the counter, kissing her just like she had in every dream she'd had since they had been apart. Their lips only parted to adjust the angle of the kiss, which resumed even more hungrily— all tongue and teeth. Rio seemed just as desperate as Agatha, which only fueled the older woman to dig her nails into Rio’s hips, drawing a soft moan from her.</p><p>“This smells amazing— JESUS! Not on top of the food, please!”</p><p>Startled by the interruption, Agatha jumped back, but not far, since Rio’s hands were still in her hair. Rio turned her head toward Alice, who was frozen halfway between the hallway and the shared kitchen-living space.</p><p>“I swear, your timing, sometimes—“ Rio muttered, releasing Agatha’s hair, while the professor took a full step back and fucking snorted, catching both students off guard.</p><p>Rio turned back toward her, already laughing but clearly unsure if Agatha found something genuinely funny or if this was the early sign of a complete mental break.</p><p>“There goes rule number one— no French kissing in front of anyone.” Just like every other rule and boundary Agatha had tried to set with Rio since their very first kiss months ago, it was obvious that their relationship was not built to follow any rules. And that earned another snort, this one followed by a shared fit of laughter that filled the kitchen.</p><p>Alice, meanwhile, remained rooted in place, watching them both nearly double over with laughter.</p><p>“Well, I’m gonna eat while you two continue… whatever <em> that </em> is.”</p><p>-</p><p>Dinner with Rio and Alice turned out to be much more normal than Agatha had expected. Alice didn’t seem at all fazed by her earlier behavior— and, to Agatha’s immense relief, didn’t bring it up. </p><p>After helping Rio clean up the kitchen, she now found herself in her bedroom.</p><p>“Maybe you could sleep here tonight?” Rio asked as she stepped into the room, already in her pajamas after a shower.</p><p>Agatha was sitting in the armchair next to the bed, checking her email, and looked up at her. “I didn’t bring any of my stuff, and I have to be on campus early tomorrow.”</p><p>“So go home early tomorrow and grab what you need?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and nodded— going back to her empty house and cold bed wasn’t even remotely appealing compared to the opportunity of sleeping next to Rio again.</p><p>Once she was ready for bed herself, she slipped under that damn electric blanket of Rio’s. The student was already lying down, scrolling on her phone. She set it on the nightstand and turned to Agatha, her hand already reaching for the back of her neck to pull her into a kiss.</p><p>Agatha, obviously, gave in, and their kiss was far more tender than the one before. When Rio’s hand began to wander, sliding under the borrowed t-shirt and up her stomach, Agatha pulled back with a mischievous smile and caught her hand.</p><p>“I thought we were taking it slow this time…”</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh and gave Agatha’s stomach a playful squeeze where her hand rested. “Yeah, but if one of the rules already went out the window—” She murmured, biting Agatha’s lip.</p><p>“Nope. I don’t want you throwing that back in my face later. We’re taking it slow this time.”</p><p>“Agatha! Come on!”</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. What? Can’t keep it in your pants?”</p><p>“Not with you in my bed, no.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and kissed her again, still holding Rio’s hand firmly in place as it tried to make its way up to her chest. Not that she didn’t want it. In fact, Agatha already knew she’d have to shower first thing in the morning because her panties would be completely ruined just from sharing a bed with Rio and not fucking her senseless like she’d been dreaming about ever since the last time they did.</p><p>Still, during their entire conversation about how things needed to be different this time —including how Agatha had convinced Rio to take her back— Rio had called most of the shots. And for Agatha, with all her pride, she needed to have the upper hand <em> somewhere </em>. If making Rio wait was where she could reclaim even a sliver of control, then fuck it, that’s exactly what she was going to do.</p><p>When the kiss finally broke, Agatha lowered her lips to Rio’s pulse point and gently bit down, earning a low moan from the younger woman. Feeling Agatha’s mouth and tongue on her neck, Rio melted into the mattress.</p><p>“You’re not playing it fair.” Rio rasped.</p><p>Agatha brought her face back up to hers and pressed a quick, noisy kiss to her lips.</p><p>“Good night, baby.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha’s week started with a feeling of home. She woke up with an arm and a leg draped over her body, and a nose breathing softly against her neck. Feeling Rio’s warm body first thing in the morning had almost made her late that Monday, but she was a responsible woman. So, fighting against what she really wanted (which was to spend the next few hours tangled up in bed with Rio), Agatha had let her sleep in a little longer and headed back to her own house.</p><p>Now, just minutes away from her weekly meeting with Danvers (and Rio), Agatha was sorting through a stack of papers she’d have Will grade, and prepping spreadsheets with current grades so her students could get a clear picture of just how screwed they were, and what kind of miracles they’d need to pass her class.</p><p>The sound of the door opening without warning made Agatha smile instantly. It could only be Rio Vidal. And sure enough, the student walked into her office with a kind of authority no other student would ever dare try to imitate.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha greeted her, distracted as she sorted the papers into two piles.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, but out of the corner of her eye, Agatha saw her walk around the desk and come to stand behind her chair, leaning down to press a kiss to the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Morning.” Rio gave her another quick peck, this time on the lips, as Agatha had turned her face toward her.</p><p>In a comfortable silence, Rio moved to the office couch and, with her laptop on her lap, quietly watched Agatha finish up her work until Danvers arrived and the meeting began.</p><p>Ever since she asked —or more accurately, ordered— Carol to tone down her very noticeable advances toward Agatha at the bar, the blonde had significantly changed her behavior around her. Not that the unnecessary touches had completely stopped, but the blatant flirting had definitely ceased.</p><p>Of course, that still wasn’t enough for Agatha to feel at ease. She spent the entire meeting perched on the edge of her chair, as if expecting an inappropriate comment from Danvers at any moment— something that would set Rio off into another jealous rage. And blow everything up. Again.</p><p>As the meeting neared its end, Agatha was listening to Danvers explain her plan to host a two-day lecture event at Salem University—a condensed version of the course they were currently teaching at Westview.</p><p>“They loved the idea. A lot of students showed interest, especially when I mentioned that Agatha Harkness would be presenting one of the days.”</p><p><em> What </em>?</p><p>Agatha and Rio both turned their heads toward Carol, with Rio somehow managing to look even more surprised than Agatha.</p><p>“Excuse me? You are giving the lecture. Both days.” Agatha said, almost as if it were a question.</p><p>“I couldn’t possibly do that, Aggie! Half the course focuses on criminal law, and as much as I love listening to you, I don’t think I’m ready to lecture on that subject.”</p><p>Rio bit her lower lip.</p><p>“When is this event supposed to be?” Agatha asked, glancing at Rio briefly before turning her gaze back to Carol.</p><p>“The weekend after our course ends here. It'll be close to finals. I figure you can spare two days to come with me to Salem, right?” Carol smiled.</p><p>Not that Agatha had a great track record of thinking on her feet when it came to Rio, and she knew that even an innocent trip to Salem University with Danvers could trigger a whole set of issues for their freshly mended relationship. So, she proposed the only condition she hoped would be enough. “Possibly. In that case, I’d need Vidal to come with me.”</p><p>Agatha avoided looking at Rio, who was clearly trying not to grin.</p><p>“Is that really necessary? She could handle the prep work here beforehand, couldn’t she?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’d say it’s definitely necessary.” Rio jumped in, drawing both professors’ attention. “Professor Harkness is swamped with her own classes and project, and I can be a huge help. Since you’re so set on having her there…"</p><p>Agatha nodded, and Carol simply shrugged. “It takes what it takes, am I right?” The blonde placed both hands on her thighs to push herself up, signaling the official end of the meeting. Both Agatha and Rio remained seated.</p><p>“I’ll let Calderu know we’re all set, then. I’ll email you the details, Aggie, and you can pass them along to her.” Danvers tilted her head toward Rio like saying the student’s name might set her tongue on fire.</p><p>“You have Vidal’s email. Send it to both of us.”</p><p>Carol did not look thrilled but didn’t argue. She said goodbye to Agatha with a hand on her shoulder, gave Rio a curt nod, and left the office.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have any time to stand up and get back to work when Rio practically launched herself from the couch into her lap. </p><p>“Fuck, you’re hot when you drag me into your work trip.” Rio said, straddling Agatha with a knee on either side of her thigh. Agatha laughed— until the sound was cut off by Rio's kiss.</p><p>-</p><p>It was the third day of the week, and Agatha and Rio had slept together three nights in a row. The last two had been at Agatha’s place, though, since as the semester was coming to its end, both Rio and Alice were overloaded with university work, and their apartment had nothing but coffee and instant noodles. Not even Rio could argue that, for now, Agatha’s place was way more comfortable —and stocked with actual food— than theirs.</p><p>“Did you tell Maximoff about us?” Rio asked as she sat down on the kitchen stool, warming her hands on a cup of tea Agatha had just made for them.</p><p>Agatha, standing in front of the fridge, replied with a brief “About what, exactly?”</p><p>“Us. Getting back together.”</p><p>The professor was pulling a few ingredients from the fridge as she answered, “Yeah, I told her today during lunch. That’s why I couldn’t meet you.”</p><p>Rio just hummed in response, and after Agatha laid out everything she’d need to cook on the counter, she looked up at the student.</p><p>“Why? Something happened?”</p><p>“No, not really. I ran into her earlier today and she gave me a funny look. For a second I thought she was going to say something, but she just looked at me and walked right past.” Rio said, resting her arms on the counter and dropping her head onto them. Her exhaustion was obvious— something that, on the bright side, worked in Agatha’s favor.</p><p>Ever since she’d decided to not put out in order to regain some semblance of control in the relationship, Agatha had assumed it wouldn’t last long— not with Rio sleeping next to her every night. But by the time night fell, they were both so wiped out there wasn’t much time or energy left for anything more than the soft affection they'd share before sleep took over. Still, in that moment in the kitchen, Agatha felt a wave of empathy for her. She knew exactly how stressful a master’s program could be. </p><p>She reached out and gently ran her hand along Rio’s arm. “Don’t worry about it. Why don’t you lie down on the couch and take a nap while I make dinner? I’ll wake you up when it’s ready.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head, propping her cheek on one hand, her messy hair falling around her face. “I can’t. I need to keep working on that article.”</p><p>“You’re not going to get anything done like this, Rio. You can barely keep your eyes on me.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? I’m always watching you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a loud laugh and gave Rio a playful pinch right where her hand rested on the student’s arm.</p><p>“Just go, you menace.” She said, and Rio obeyed, hopping off the stool. She leaned in to kiss Agatha before heading to the living room.</p><p>The silence that followed while Agatha cooked told her that Rio had, in fact, followed through and was napping. However, when Agatha finished setting the table and walked into the living room, Rio was sprawled on the couch— phone in hand.</p><p>“Are you fucking serious? What are you, a teenager?” Agatha asked, making Rio turn her head toward her with a wide, unapologetic grin.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep— But hey, I had an idea! What do you think about going to the movies next week?” Rio asked as she got up to follow Agatha to the dining room.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Nicky’s going to be with me next week.”</p><p>They both sat at the table, and despite looking tired, Rio’s smile stayed bright.</p><p>“Yeah I know. I was thinking the three of us could go, then grab something he likes to eat after— You know, so I can make a good impression since he probably sees me as the annoying environmental science project lady.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, scooping some fettuccine with white sauce and broccoli onto her plate. “We can do that, sure. Just has to be early, though, so it doesn’t mess with his nighttime routine.”</p><p>“There’s a showing of Final Destination 6 at five-thirty, and you don’t have class late that day, so it works.” Rio said, focused on her plate and completely missing the look of utter disbelief Agatha shot her.</p><p>“Are you insane? He can’t watch that!”</p><p>Rio looked up mid-chew, swallowing quickly. “Why not?”</p><p>“Because he’s fucking eight?”</p><p>“So? I watched worse stuff than that when I was his age.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not traumatizing my kid with people getting killed in the most gruesome ways imaginable on a giant movie screen— Not happening.”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha, come on! I wanna watch it before I see spoilers.” </p><p>“We’ll go tomorrow after your class. I’ll pick you up from campus.” Agatha offered, sipping her wine.</p><p>Rio paused mid-chew again and covered her mouth with her hand. “Can’t. I’m meeting the girls at the bar after class. Speaking of which, don’t you wanna come? I’m going with Alice and Yelena.”</p><p>Agatha drank nearly her entire glass of wine just to stop herself from scowling.</p><p>“What bar?”</p><p>“That rustic-looking one near campus, you know?” Rio replied, more focused on the food in front of her than on Agatha’s visible effort to keep her expression neutral.</p><p>“Yeah, then no, Rio. That place has more students than Ralph’s entire lecture hall.” Agatha said, her irritated tone going right over Rio’s head, who just laughed at the comparison.</p><p>“Well, I can come here after.”</p><p>“Don’t bother. I’m getting an early night tomorrow.” Agatha replied dryly, and that did catch Rio’s attention. Rio frowned at her. Agatha didn’t say anything else and took her last bite of food.</p><p>Alice obviously already knew about them, but Agatha wasn’t sure if Yelena had been filled in yet, and she also didn’t know if that alone would be enough to keep the girl’s hands off Rio’s waist.</p><p>Agatha made a mental note not to open instagram for the next twenty-four hours starting tomorrow night.</p><p>Rio set her utensils down. “Are you upset that I’m going out with them? ‘Cause I wasn’t planning to stay out until midnight or anything. I can still come back early and sleep with you, if that’s the issue.”</p><p>Yes, she was upset. “No. It’s fine.”</p><p>“Agatha—“</p><p>“Do you mind cleaning up? I still have a few things to get done tonight."</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together but simply nodded and kept eating in silence. Agatha refilled her wine glass, and the two stayed quiet until Rio finished her meal as well.</p><p>They both stood at the same time, and before Rio could restart the conversation —which she absolutely would— Agatha headed straight to her home office.</p><p>Seated at her desk, Agatha had her reading glasses on and was reviewing the submissions from her extension project students when Rio walked in. Agatha expected her to settle at the other desk or maybe in the armchair, but instead, Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and started massaging them.</p><p>Agatha let out an involuntary moan when Rio pressed into a knot near her shoulder, and the student smiled, continuing her effort to work out the tension.</p><p>“Let me know when you’re relaxed enough for us to talk.”</p><p>The professor paused her typing for a moment but then continued, finishing her last thought in the document before sending it off to her students. When she closed that tab, the one behind opened— it was the exam for the course Rio was enrolled in. Agatha promptly closed the laptop and turned her chair to face Rio.</p><p>“What do you want to talk about?”</p><p>Rio tried not to smile at how fast Agatha had hidden her exam and then sat in her lap— awkwardly, balancing herself on top of Agatha in the office chair. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“Are you upset that I’m going out with them?” When Agatha opened her mouth, Rio warned, “Answer me sincerely this time.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. Yes, she had promised honesty and transparency with Rio this time around, but she still wasn’t sure how much truth was too much— especially when it came to feelings she wasn’t even sure she had the right to feel.</p><p>Brutal honesty had never really worked with Natasha. Again— so many arguments could have been avoided if Agatha had just taken a breath and swallowed her words. Not that this approach had worked with Rio, so Agatha tried to find the words that would soften what she really wanted to say.</p><p>“I’m not upset. You have every right to go out with your friends. I’m just not a huge fan of how Yelena clings to you, and I say that based on the photos I’ve seen. I don’t even know what goes on off-camera.”</p><p>Agatha had half-expected Rio to laugh or brush off her comment— something to downplay or dismiss her feelings. That wouldn’t have been new for her in a relationship.</p><p>Surprisingly, Rio said, “She knows I’m yours, even before we got back together. She’s just... Very physically affectionate.”</p><p>“With Gulliver too?”</p><p>When Rio didn’t answer right away, Agatha added dryly, “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>“She was a really good friend when I was a mess after everything that happened. I’m not going to push her away just because we got back together. That would be a very dick move.”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to.”</p><p>“Then what do you want me to do, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated sigh. “Nothing! Literally nothing— It’s getting late, don’t you still have things to work on tonight?”</p><p>The attempt to divert the discussion irritated Rio even more, and she stood up from Agatha’s lap. “Fuck, Agatha, why can’t you just tell me what you expect from me?”</p><p>“I know we’ve got a big age gap, but I’m not your mother— I’m not here to tell you what you should or shouldn’t do!”</p><p>“Good thing you’re not, because I’d have to dig six feet under to get a straight answer out of you. Although right now, that actually seems more doable than having a conversation with you!”</p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth a few times, caught completely off guard. As much as neither of them had ever talked about their parents, she had no idea Rio’s mom had passed away. Fuck.</p><p>Rio left the home office and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Agatha waited to hear the front door open, assuming Rio had decided to go back to her apartment after Agatha so expertly shoved her foot in her mouth— but the sound never came. She searched downstairs and found nothing. </p><p>She found Rio in her bedroom— or rather, in the bathroom. The sound of the shower running and the door closed.</p><p>Agatha sat on the bed and waited for Rio to come out. When she did, wearing sweatpants and a tank top, she didn’t look at Agatha.</p><p>“Rio, I’m sorry. I didn’t know—“</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to. We’ve never talked about it.”</p><p>Agatha closed her mouth again, watching as Rio rummaged through her backpack, which for some reason was in the bedroom. She pulled out a few papers, a highlighter, and sat down on the bed with the materials in her lap.</p><p>The professor moved to Rio’s side of the bed and sat down on the edge.</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“Look, I don’t have any dead mommy issues, so just let it go, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, and Rio, completely ignoring the way Agatha was taking up half of her space on the bed, lined up the printed pages, all covered in handwritten notes, and started reading.</p><p>The professor let out a long sigh and headed into the en suite bathroom.</p><p>After a long shower and an even longer skincare routine, Agatha returned to the bedroom and found Rio in exactly the same position. Agatha went to her own side of the bed. </p><p>Under the covers and with her back against the headboard, she put on her reading glasses and picked up the book from her nightstand.</p><p>The silence didn’t last long.</p><p>“Why do you people have to make everything so difficult? I swear…”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You law people. I swear you all use Word and then the thesaurus for half the words just to sound smarter. Total Joey Tribbiani style.”</p><p>Even though Rio kept a serious expression, Agatha snorted and closed her book. “Is this from my class?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Let me help you.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why not? I’m right here.”</p><p>“Because I don’t need your help.” Rio responded proudly and turned her attention back to the paper in front of her. She read about three words before her brow furrowed again, almost earning another snort from the older woman.</p><p>Agatha pulled the now slightly crumpled pages out of Rio’s hands, prompting a small squeal of protest. Rio opened her mouth to complain, but Agatha silenced her with a single look before glancing over the course material that had been giving Rio so much misery.</p><p>She read for a few moments while Rio pouted beside her.</p><p>“Okay… Blue criminology. What’s the issue?”</p><p>“Several.” Rio answered, clearly exaggerating. “I don’t understand how the recognition of ecocide as an international crime can interact with existing frameworks in our country. It doesn’t make sense if each country has its own legal jurisdiction.”</p><p>It was a really good question— one Agatha had hoped some student would bring up in class, but none had. She smiled at Rio and shifted to sit up straighter, turning toward her.</p><p>“That’s the thing. Ecocide could influence international norms, and environmental advocates might use it to apply political pressure in the country. However… it wouldn’t have direct legal effect unless it’s adopted through U.S. legal processes.”</p><p>Rio was no longer interested in trying to reclaim her study material, instead playing idly with the ends of Agatha’s hair. “In that case, how does international recognition impact how courts approach environmental crimes?” </p><p>“It can influence courts indirectly, baby. Even if it’s not legally binding, it can create pressure for lawmakers to update environmental laws, and offer new legal frameworks that judges or advocates might reference.”</p><p>Rio slowly nodded as the words started to make sense in her head. The fingers that had been playing with her Agatha’s hair slid up to trace the line of her jaw.</p><p>“Any further questions? I really don’t mind helping you, Rio. Actually, I prefer it over watching my assistant fail my own class.” Agatha joked, prompting a smile from Rio.</p><p>“Yeah, just one more. It’s a simple one, actually.”</p><p>“Shoot.”</p><p>“Why weren’t you honest with me earlier?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression dropped. She looked away from Rio and answered after a long sigh. “I was honest. You have the right to do whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio stared at her. “Now say that in a way that’s a little less passive-aggressive for me, love.”</p><p>Whether the use of love was intentional —meant to soften Agatha’s words— or not, who knew? Maybe she needed to stop assuming Rio chose her words just to pull different reactions out of her. But old habits die hard.</p><p>“Ugh… Look, tomorrow you go out and then come back here, is that okay? I’m not going to tell you where to go or who to hang out with. We’ve already fought way too many times because of how other people act around me, and that’s just not a fight worth having.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened at Agatha’s level of sincerity and emotional maturity— though, of course, that didn’t mean Agatha wasn’t internally fuming and seriously considering deleting that damn app from her phone.</p><p>As if Rio could read her mind, she said, “Totally agree with you… Sweetheart, would you mind if I took a picture with your room in the background?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. What the actual fuck?</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I want to start showing people I’m seeing someone, too.”</p><p>Agatha still didn’t quite understand how her room showing up in one of Rio’s stories would be any kind of clear relationship indication, unless… Oh. <em> Oh. </em> If someone recognized it as not being Rio’s room, they'd know she was with someone else. </p><p>Jesus. How many people knew what Rio’s room looked like? </p><p>Okay, not the time for that existential spiral, especially with Rio’s hazel eyes staring at her, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“Uh, yeah? I guess…”</p><p>Rio gathered the papers she'd been studying on the bed, and within minutes, she had taken the picture, posted it to her story, and put her phone away again. Agatha watched, surprised by how fast the student moved. To be honest, Agatha would have taken an embarrassing amount of time just to take the picture.</p><p>With both the phone and papers now on the nightstand, Rio turned back to Agatha and leaned over her, fingers sinking into her waist.</p><p>“Are you ready for Saturday? I’m coming here so we can go together. Don’t go overboard with the clothes, though. It’s supposed to be sunny all day and the place is outdoors.” Rio informed her while nuzzling into her neck.</p><p>“Any dress code?” Agatha asked, one hand already sliding to Rio’s hair as she kissed her neck.</p><p>“Uhm… Maybe don’t wear your work clothes, so people won’t spot your hot ass from a mile away.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, pulling Rio in for a kiss with her fingers curled at the back of her neck.</p><p>“If someone recognizes me there, Rio… I swear.”</p><p>Rio ran the tip of her tongue over Agatha’s bottom lip, and Agatha’s mouth parted instinctively.</p><p>“What? You gonna punish me? I can think of so many ways you could punish me real good.”</p><p>Fucking menace. Agatha pushed Rio’s head forward and kissed her harder, her tongue demanding entry, and Rio smirked into it. Agatha wanted nothing more than to fuck that cocky smile right off her face.</p><p>Still… Self-control. That was it. Agatha wouldn’t give in over one comment, or Rio’s tongue tangling with hers, even if her underwear begged otherwise.</p><p>“You’re going to regret saying that when I lose my patience.” Agatha whispered against her mouth.  </p><p>When Rio stuck her tongue out to tease her again, Agatha pulled away.</p><p>Rio groaned. “Agatha, fuck… Just looking at you makes me wet. At this rate, when you finally lose your so-called patience, I’m gonna come before you even touch me.”</p><p>Agatha giggled, pulling further back and putting some space between them.</p><p>“How cute of you to think you’ll be allowed to come before I say so.”</p><p>-</p><p>On the day of the festival, Agatha spent a very long time in her bedroom with Wanda. Four frantic hands had rifled through her clothes longer than either woman would ever admit. The problem was that nearly every option had been vetoed— either it screamed Professor Harkness, or was too summery, too wintry, or made her look like a mom chaperoning her teenage kid to a concert.</p><p>They finally settled on a sleeveless top with a high neckline and a keyhole cut-out just above the chest. Agatha was in front of her bathroom mirror, zipping up the gold detail at the collar. She was already wearing fitted, high-waisted black pants and had trusted Wanda to find a jacket that would complement the outfit.</p><p>“Did you charge your phone? I want pictures, because if there’s one thing I never thought I’d see, it’s you at a festival like this.” Wanda called from the bedroom, sprawled on Agatha’s bed.</p><p>Going for light makeup, Agatha was putting on her usual accessories —earrings, her watch, and rings— when she replied loud enough to be heard from the bathroom, “It’s charging. Tell me about it, Jesus…”</p><p>Wanda let out a loud laugh. Besides the hooded jacket and a pair of dark sunglasses, Agatha had no idea what else she could do to avoid being recognized by someone, like a student, at the festival. Then again, realistically speaking, with the amount of drinking and live music happening, no one was going to look twice at her… Right?</p><p>Before Agatha could let herself spiral into all the possible outcomes —good or disastrous— that could unfold at the all-day event ahead, she heard her front door open, followed by Rio’s voice calling out for her.</p><p>Wanda raised her brows with a smirk. “Feeling right at home already…”</p><p>Agatha walked over to her bedroom door, ignoring the very true comment from the redhead, and yelled, “Over here!”</p><p>A moment later, she heard Rio’s footsteps coming upstairs.</p><p>When she stepped in, Agatha completely forgot there was a third person in the room. Her eyes swept over Rio’s body with silent reverence. She was wearing a bralette-style crop top with thin straps and a plunging neckline, paired with a skirt that left very little to the imagination, thanks to a thigh-high slit on one side.</p><p>Agatha only realized her mouth had fallen open while staring when Wanda cleared her throat, loudly, to grab their attention. Rio had also been shamelessly drinking in the sight of Agatha.</p><p>Both women turned their heads toward Wanda, still lounging on the bed, her grin wicked. “Hey, Vidal. Just wanted to thank you for finally convincing Agatha to do something fun in her free time.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, and Rio laughed.</p><p>“Hey. Convince isn’t exactly the right word…” Rio replied.</p><p>“More like forced.” </p><p>Wanda and Rio laughed, while Agatha went back to finishing packing the purse she’d be taking.</p><p>“Geez, the youth these days…” Wanda commented, eyeing the amount of skin Rio was showing. “You sure you don’t want to borrow a jacket?”</p><p>“I brought one, it’s downstairs. The forecast isn’t calling for much cold today, thank god, because last year I froze my ass off.” Rio answered, checking her phone. A moment later, she added, “You ready? The later we get there, the longer the line’s gonna be.”</p><p>Agatha zipped her bag closed. “All ready to go.”</p><p>“That’s my cue. Alright, ladies, have fun. Agatha, the boys are asking for a playdate with Nicky.” Wanda said as she got up from the bed.</p><p>“I’ll text you tomorrow so we can set something up.” Agatha replied. And just as Wanda reached the bedroom door, Agatha added, “And thank you, by the way.”</p><p>The two women exchanged smiles, and Wanda left.</p><p>-</p><p>Luckily, there wasn’t a drop of rain in the forecast, because Rio hadn’t been exaggerating when she said the event was completely outdoors. The only covered area was the bathrooms— places Agatha had absolutely no intention of entering.</p><p>The festival was already packed, with groups of people weaving between the various stages where artists were already performing. Agatha and Rio walked hand-in-hand toward one of the stages Rio had picked out.</p><p>“Are you hungry?” Rio asked once they sat down on the ground, beers in hand.</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“You sure? 'Cause once the show starts, it’s gonna be a pain to push through the crowd and then try to come back. I don’t mind grabbing something for you now, sweetheart.”</p><p>“I’m sure, Rio. So—“ The words fell right out of Agatha’s mouth when she saw Rio taking off one of her shoes. Just one. “What the fuck are you doing?!”</p><p>Rio just smiled and reached inside her sock, pulling out a tiny plastic bag tucked between her foot and the sole of her sneaker.</p><p>“That better be aspirin.” Agatha said flatly, which made Rio laugh and shake her head as she dropped the baggie in her own lap.</p><p>“It’s a festival, sweetheart. Gotta have the full experience.”</p><p>“Nope. Not me.” </p><p>Call her old if you wanted, but Agatha, in her fucking forties, was not about to do drugs at a music festival.</p><p>“Don’t mind me, then.” Rio shrugged and popped one of the pills into her mouth, washing it down with beer while Agatha stared at her in disbelief.</p><p>“Jesus, we barely got here and I’m already having flashbacks.” Agatha grumbled, visibly distressed. “If you end up in that state again, I’m hosing you down in the garage, and that’s where you’re sleeping, understood?”</p><p>Rio cracked up, getting on her knees to scoot over and practically sit in Agatha’s lap. Apparently, the public display of affection rule didn’t apply at festivals, just like sobriety.</p><p>“You worry too much… Just relax.” Rio smiled, pressing a kiss to the corner of her lips.</p><p>“I worry about you. And you know how I feel about you taking that kind of thing.”</p><p>Agatha pretended not to notice Rio slipping the baggie into her purse.</p><p>“I promise nothing bad is gonna happen, okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, just gave a small nod. Rio flashed that smile she knew could break through Agatha’s walls, and as expected, it worked. Agatha rested a hand on her bare thigh and leaned in close to whisper against her ear.</p><p>“You’re killing me in that outfit, you know that, right?”</p><p>Rio smirked, her lips immediately finding Agatha’s.</p><p>-</p><p>A few hours and several beers later, Agatha stood behind Rio with her arms draped over her shoulders, hands clasped around her stomach as they watched one of the concerts. Rio still had her sunglasses on, partly to shield herself from the sun, and partly to keep Agatha from seeing just how dilated her pupils were.</p><p>By that point, Agatha wasn’t as worried about the younger woman anymore. Rio was just moving with a bit more enthusiasm than usual, laughing a little too hard at things that weren’t all that funny, and being far more affectionate in public than Agatha was comfortable with. She had made the right call wearing a high-neck top. If she hadn’t, she’d probably be covered in hickeys by now, judging by how often Rio’s mouth had found her skin.</p><p>When the concert ended, they made their way over to the food area, which was filled with food trucks all reeking of greasy food. They settled on burgers.</p><p>Agatha left Rio sitting on one of the benches while she went to grab their food. As she waited for their order, she kept glancing over to check on Rio— just to make sure her slightly drunk and completely high ass didn’t wander off into the crowd.</p><p>With the food finally in hand, Agatha turned back one last time, and froze. A guy was standing in front of Rio, far closer than any stranger had the right to be. Infuriated, Agatha started walking over.</p><p>“Well, well... if it isn’t the wild one…” The guy said, wearing a pathetic excuse for a smile, his body leaning a little too close to Rio’s.</p><p>“You? Again? Can’t take a hint? For fucks sake.” </p><p>The guy let out a loud laugh. “You’re fucking high again? Oh Rio… You missed your chance on that couch, but here I am, swallowing my pride, giving you another shot…”</p><p>If it had taken Agatha fifteen steps to get the food, it took her half that to get back. She dropped the bag with their food onto the table and placed a possessive hand on Rio’s shoulder, startling the younger woman.</p><p>With zero survival instincts, the guy’s grin only widened as he looked between the two of them. “Shit, your friend wasn’t kidding. Look at you… With a milf.” He turned to Agatha, raising his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>The fucking audacity. Agatha snarled at him, lifting her sunglasses so there would be no confusion about what she was about to say— or the level of contempt in her eyes. But before she could unload on him, Rio wrapped an arm around her waist and stood up.</p><p>“Love—“</p><p>Agatha glanced at her for the briefest second, then shifted her icy blue gaze back to the guy. His eyes had gone wide. </p><p>Agatha could eviscerate someone with words, but this might’ve been the first time she had completely destroyed a grown man with just a look. She didn’t get to savor the moment, though, because the guy was opening his mouth in shock.</p><p>“Professor Harkness?”</p><p>Was that a fucking <em> student </em>? </p><p> </p>

<em> “Professor Harkness?” </em>
</p><p>Fuck. Think fast. Faster. </p><p>Was she a family friend of Rio Vidal? Her aunt, maybe? Sure, because clearly her niece would be calling her love and wrapping a possessive arm around her waist the way Rio was doing right now.</p><p>And of course, trust Rio to still be under the effects of whatever the hell pill she took, unable to come up with a decent excuse faster than Agatha could. And even though her blue eyes were still throwing daggers at the guy, her alcohol-fogged neurons weren’t communicating the way they should.</p><p>She definitely didn’t know the guy, but it wasn’t just her own students who recognized her at Westview. Nearly a decade of teaching at the same institution, with a solid reputation that extended beyond her department— it wasn’t a shocker that some random asshole knew her name.</p><p>Which was the case.</p><p>“A Westview student harassing women? Are you kidding?” Agatha put on her most skeptical face, redirecting his attention away from Rio’s fingers digging into her waist.</p><p>His eyes practically popped out of their sockets and he shook his head furiously. “No, no, no— I wasn’t harassing her!” He gestured toward Rio, panicked. “We’re friends, right, Rio?”</p><p>Rio lowered her sunglasses to the tip of her nose and gave the guy a once-over. “I don’t even know your fucking name, dude.”</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated huff. Not because he’d just tried hitting on Rio, but because Rio could’ve said literally anything else to get them out of that mess without dragging it out further. Fucking shit.</p><p>The idiot ran a hand through his messy hair and let out a nervous laugh. “Look, this is a huge misunderstanding, alright? I wasn’t harassing anybody— If I knew you were <em> her </em> milf, I wouldn’t have even come over to say hi.”</p><p>“What did you just say?” Agatha barked, her tone low and deadly, one neither of the students missed. He instinctively stepped back, cheeks flushing red; and Rio turned toward her, murmuring against her neck, “Agatha, let’s just go—“</p><p>The guy, scared and inattentive, opened his mouth again. “You know, milf? Mother I’d like to fuck? No disrespect, obviously, just trying to—“</p><p>“Get the hell out. Now.” Agatha cut him off, voice sharp. </p><p>The guy practically tripped over his own feet backing away, shooting them one last look before disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>“Well done, Rio. Really.” Agatha muttered under her breath, grabbing the food so they could get the fuck out of there. Fucking shoot her if anyone else recognizes her again.</p><p>“How is this my fault?!” Rio asked, walking behind Agatha.</p><p>“Why do you think? I told you this was going to happen. I knew it would. And still, I said yes just to make you happy.”</p><p>With no reply from Rio, they walked in tense silence until they found a spot out of the main flow of people moving between stages. Once seated, Agatha handed her the wrapped veggie burger. </p><p>They had finished eating, and Rio was still picking at both her own fries and Agatha’s when she finally spoke again.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I knew there was a risk, but I really wanted to do this with you.”</p><p>“Why, Rio? I barely know these artists, and you’d probably have way more fun here with one of your friends than you’re having with me.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t.” Rio said firmly. “I want to do couple stuff with you, Agatha, especially with how crazy our schedules have been lately… I just want to feel like I’m actually in a relationship with you.”</p><p>Agatha knew where she was coming from, because despite the domesticity they had unconsciously adopted in recent days, any and all free time was spent talking about university. Doing university things. Worrying about university-related matters.</p><p>She sighed, taking another sip of her water. “I get that. I do. I’m just pissed because I should’ve thought of something better to say to that asshole. And you, high out of your mind, didn’t help at all.”</p><p>Rio popped the last fry into her mouth and, chewing slowly, nodded. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I’m going to have to talk to Calderu on Monday. It’s better she hears it from me than through some student gossip.” </p><p>“I can go with you—“</p><p>“No. It’s better if you don’t.” Agatha said, letting out a long sigh. She was fully aware of the possible ramifications and the legal implications of being involved with a student.</p><p>She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and looked up at Rio for a second, who now, with her pupils back to normal, was watching her carefully.</p><p>Rio moved closer to Agatha, whose gaze stayed straight ahead again. “Agatha, don’t do that. Don’t shut me out.” The student reached for her hand, gently brushing her knuckles.</p><p>“I just need some time to process this. We’re fine.”</p><p>“Look at me and say that.” Rio asked, and Agatha turned to face her. Rio had already taken off her sunglasses and now did the same with Agatha’s.</p><p>“We are fine.” Agatha repeated.</p><p>“I’m really sorry.”</p><p>Agatha gave a slight nod, feeling the ache in her lower back from either standing or sitting on the ground for hours— sue her, she was too old for this shit. </p><p>She threw her arms behind her, leaning on her forearms to relieve some of the pressure, and Rio looked like a spectator as Agatha felt every second of her gaze.</p><p>“Stop it.” Agatha murmured, a smile threatening to tug at her lips.</p><p>“I’m not doing anything.”</p><p>“You know you are. And stop it.”</p><p>Rio smirked, placing a hand on Agatha’s thigh. “I miss you.”</p><p>“You do know I’m sitting right here, right?” Agatha teased, earning a playful pinch to her thigh that made her grunt. Rio laughed.</p><p>“I miss the way you taste.”</p><p>“Rio—“</p><p>“You have no idea how bad I want you.”</p><p>“It wasn’t dreadful enough that a student spotted me and called me a milf, now you want to get us arrested for public indecency? You’re on fire today.” Agatha said, and Rio burst out laughing.</p><p>“Cracking jokes already, huh?”</p><p>“Either that or I lose my fucking mind. Take your pick.”</p><p>“I just didn’t know a milf could be this funny…”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her. “Don’t even start with that. I’m serious—“</p><p>“What? You <em> are </em> a mother I like very much to fuck.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know whether to laugh or scold her, so she just rolled her eyes. Rio laughed again.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to get into the whole mess of what the next week would look like, between the tension of potential gossip and the conversation she’d have to have with Lilia… So, the subject was officially off the table. </p><p>Not that it helped her relax, especially after checking the time— another performance Rio had been excited to see was about to start soon. As if reading her mind, Rio reached for Agatha’s purse, and the second her hand went inside, Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“What are you looking for?”</p><p>Rio flashed a wide, toothy smile. “You know…” She pulled out the small baggie.</p><p>Agatha sat upright again. “I don’t want you to take that.”</p><p>“This again? Agatha, you saw I was fine—“</p><p>“I don’t want you to take that, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed and gave up on opening the baggie. “Then tell me why.”</p><p>“First of all, because I don’t like it when you use, especially after that night.” Rio opened her mouth to protest, but Agatha cut her off. “And using it here? If something happens to you, by the time I call someone or try to carry you somewhere… I’d have zero control over the situation. And I don’t want you to use it. Is that enough?”</p><p>“Fine… There goes money down the drain.” Rio muttered, tossing the baggie back into Agatha’s purse.</p><p>She did look genuinely bummed about being stopped from taking the drugs, and Agatha found herself wondering, just for a moment, whether the disappointment came from the wasted money or if getting high really made that much of a difference to her festival experience. Either way, she knew Rio well enough by now to know exactly what kind of words would snap her right out of that mood.</p><p>Agatha slung an arm over Rio’s shoulders, turning her face toward hers and breathing in her perfume, her nose tucked just behind her ear. “Besides… I think you will want to be very sober for what I plan to do to you once we leave here.”</p><p>Rio turned to her, eyes already lighting up. </p><p>“Wait— Are you for real? Fuck this. Let’s leave now.”</p><p>She started to get up, but Agatha, laughing, grabbed her by the waist and pulled her back down beside her.</p><p>“Not happening, baby. You were the one who wanted to come here, remember? So we’re staying. And you’re going to spend the next few hours thinking about my fingers inside you.”</p><p>“Fuck this festival, Agatha, please. Let’s leave, right this second.”</p><p>“Nope. We are staying.”</p><p>Rio let out a frustrated groan and leaned her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder, utterly defeated. Agatha lifted her chin until their eyes met, pressed a kiss to her lips, and leaned in close to her ear. “Don’t pout, sweetheart. You got what you wanted, me at this festival. Later, I’m going to get what I want, which is to make you scream my name until your throat is raw.”</p><p>-</p><p>Hours later, with the sun nearly set, they were exhausted in the back seat of the uber. Despite the chilly wind against her skin, Agatha was sweating, dying for a shower, while Rio (though just as tired) could barely contain her excitement at the prospect of what was about to happen once they got to Agatha’s house.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Agatha had just closed the front door when Rio was all over her, hands gripping her waist and lips pressed to her pulse point.</p><p>“God, I’m already so wet for you.” Rio whispered against her skin, her mouth traveling up to Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back with matching desperation, feeling Rio’s tongue push into her mouth like it was claiming territory. And Agatha? Well, she was more than willing to surrender it.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss, drawing a low growl of frustration from Agatha, who was already tugging down the zipper of her tank top while Rio stumbled over her own feet, trying to kick off her shoes.</p><p>Agatha had just about gotten the zipper halfway down when her entire body froze.</p><p>“Auntie Agatha?”</p><p>Rio froze mid-bend— one hand on her shoelace, the other braced against the wall for balance. Agatha turned toward the sound of the small voice and found Billy standing at the edge of the hallway that led to the kitchen, brow furrowed in confusion.</p><p>
<em> What the fuck was that kid doing there? </em>
</p><p>Agatha yanked the zipper back up so fast the metal teeth left an imprint on her finger.</p><p>“Billy? Hey, kiddo.” She cleared her throat, carefully walking toward him. “Everything okay? Where’s your mom?” </p><p>After all, she needed to know exactly where Wanda was so she could strangle her.</p><p>“She’s outside. We’re grilling.” He craned his neck to peek past Agatha at Rio, who was still frozen in the same position, like her body had some type of error 404 and forgotten how to move. “Who is she?”</p><p>Agatha turned her head toward Rio and raised her eyebrows in a clear <em> stop being fucking weird and stand up like a human </em>signal. Slowly, Rio straightened her spine and walked over until she stood beside Agatha.</p><p>“Hi.” </p><p>That’s all she offered.</p><p>Billy continued to look suspiciously at the woman who, for some reason, was desperate to be barefoot in his aunt's house.</p><p>“Billy, this is Rio. She’s… A friend, of mine.” </p><p>No way in hell was she about to explain their relationship to a gossip-prone kid who just happened to be her son’s best friend.</p><p>“Could you call your mom for me, honey?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Billy nodded and ran off in the opposite direction. Both women let out a deep breath and exchanged a look of shared panic and absolute misery. But before they could even begin to process what the hell had just happened, Wanda appeared at the end of the hallway.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but Agatha beat her to it.</p><p>“Wanda, what the <em> fuck </em>? What are you doing here? That key is for emergencies, not for a goddamn barbecue!”</p><p>Wanda blinked in surprise. “I texted you! Our grill wasn’t working. Though honestly, I think Vision just didn’t know how to light it, and—“</p><p>“So you brought the whole party here?!”</p><p>“You have such a nice space… And I did text you!”</p><p>Agatha groaned in frustration. Her phone was long forgotten at the bottom of her purse, and all she could think about was how she could have had her hands on Rio’s bare body right now instead of dealing with unexpected guests in her own damn house.</p><p>“You’re both welcome to join, by the way. You two must be starving! Vision made that garlic bread you love—“</p><p>Agatha was starving, yes, but it definitely wasn’t for garlic bread.</p><p>Silence fell between the three of them, mostly because neither Agatha nor Rio had any idea how to explain that they very much wanted an empty house, and definitely couldn’t say why. </p><p>Finally, Rio, now recovered from the shock, lightly grabbed Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“Um, I’m actually not feeling great. I think something I ate at the festival didn’t sit right. Would you mind taking me home?”</p><p>This was the Rio she had wanted hours earlier with that fucking guy.</p><p>Agatha offered a polite smile. “Sure, yeah.” She turned to the redhead. “Just make sure to lock up before you leave.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a suspicious look but nodded. After a few quick goodbyes, Agatha was already driving toward Rio’s apartment.</p><p>-</p><p>They climbed the stairs to Rio’s apartment in a mix of strain and hurry. </p><p>Nearly getting caught with her hands all over Rio by a child, of all people, had been enough to kill her desperation. Momentarily. But it had already been days of restraint, of biting down needs she no longer had the patience or desire to suppress.</p><p>She needed Rio. And she needed her right fucking now.</p><p>Which is why Agatha nearly screamed in frustration when they opened the apartment door and came face to face with Alice and William at the kitchen counter in the middle of a study session.</p><p>Will masked his surprise as best he could, shooting them a lopsided smile in greeting. He’d never seen his professor in clothes like that before— let alone a neckline that practically hoisted her breasts up to her collarbone.</p><p>Great.</p><p>“Alice, do you mind if I talk to you for a second?” Rio asked, already tugging her friend toward the hallway, while Agatha stood frozen, unsure whether she should head to Rio’s room or just walk out and call it a day. </p><p>Once the girls disappeared down the hallway, Will turned his laptop screen toward Agatha. </p><p>“We’re working on your class paper.”</p><p>Agatha just nodded and looked away.</p><p>He gave a crooked smile. “I didn’t know you two were back together, but I’m glad! You make such an awesome couple, and you know—“</p><p>“Uh-huh, thanks.” Agatha cut off his yapping. “You know my office hours if you need assistance. Excuse me.” She didn’t wait for a response and headed straight to Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>Inside, she ran a hand through her hair, which by now was a tangled mess of knots and dried sweat. From there, she could hear the voices of the two women drifting into the room.</p><p>
<em> “… Leave?! Will lives with like five people, it’s impossible to have anything done there!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I don’t care! Alice, please, just go somewhere else. I’m begging you.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha nearly laughed at the distress in Rio’s voice.</p><p>
<em> “You don’t have to hang out with us, Rio. I swear we won’t even ask her for help… Although holy shit, have you started that paper? If she’s helping you, you have to convince her—“ </em>
</p><p>
<em> “ALICE! I’m trying to get fucking laid here, did you not get that? I need you both gone. Right now.” </em>
</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>
<em> “Well, you could’ve led with that.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I did, you’re just too damn slow. Now get out.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear anything else, just footsteps in the hallway and murmurs coming from the kitchen. Most likely William grumbling about the sudden change of plans. While they talked and packed up the study materials from the counter, she grabbed some of Rio’s clothes and slipped quietly into the bathroom.</p><p>By the time she came out, the apartment had gone quiet, a sign they’d finally left, probably after much pleading and urgency from Rio. Agatha headed to the bedroom, dressed in Rio’s oversized sweats and towel-drying her hair. </p><p>The second she opened the door, her heart, for what felt like the hundredth time that day, nearly gave out.</p><p>Rio was sitting at the edge of the bed, still wearing her festival outfit— minus her underwear. And Agatha knew that for a fact, because Rio had adjusted the angle of her skirt’s slit, exposing the inside of her thigh and just a teasing glimpse of her pussy.</p><p>Agatha shut and locked the door behind her. When she turned around, Rio’s hand was between her legs, under her skirt.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?” Agatha asked, walking over and stopping right in front of her. Rio’s hand didn’t move.</p><p>“You were taking forever, so I figured I might as well start without you.”</p><p>Rio smirked, and Agatha, whose patience had been worn thin by every obstacle that day, grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand toward her face. A thick slickness coated Rio’s index and middle fingers, which Agatha took into her mouth. Her tongue swirled around them slowly, and the second she did, Rio moaned, spreading her legs wider, like she was waiting for Agatha.</p><p>She only released Rio’s fingers from her mouth once there wasn’t a trace of arousal left on them.</p><p>“Strip for me.” Agatha said, noting the flicker of surprise in Rio’s eyes. But just as quickly, she obeyed. They switched places— Agatha now sitting on the bed, and Rio standing just inches in front of her.</p><p>Rio slid the fingers of her right hand over her left shoulder, hooking the thin spaghetti strap and pulling it down her arm. She did the same with the right, slow and deliberate.</p><p>“Tell me what you want me to do to you.” Agatha commanded, her palms flat on the mattress, fingers pressing into the sheets.</p><p>As Rio tugged off her top, her eyes never left Agatha’s. “I want to feel your tongue.” She whispered. The top loosened, and with the lightest nudge, it fell to the floor, exposing her breasts and hard nipples, making Agatha’s mouth water. “Your fingers.”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers found the hidden zipper of her skirt, and after unfastening it, she began to slide it down slowly with just her fingertips, her gaze still locked on Agatha. “I want to feel like I belong to you.” She said. “Like I’m only yours.”</p><p>Agatha’s self-control shattered the moment Rio’s skirt hit the floor, revealing her dripping cunt just an arm’s length away.</p><p>She rose from the bed with the vague idea of being gentle— but what happened instead was her shoving Rio down onto the mattress with unapologetic strength. The younger woman, the menace she was, only smirked up at her as Agatha straddled her.</p><p>“You <em> are </em>mine.” </p><p>Agatha kissed her with a force that left no room for doubt. Rio was hers. </p><p>Her dominant hand slid down the other woman's body, and Agatha moaned with pure desire as her fingers found her soaked, burning pussy.</p><p>“I barely touched you and you’re already dripping down your thighs.” Agatha growled, fingers pressing firmly against Rio’s cunt, carefully avoiding her clit. “You’re fucking pathetic.”</p><p>Rio bit her lower lip to muffle a moan, hands flying into Agatha’s hair and pulling her back down for another kiss. This time, Agatha allowed it. Her fingers slowly tracing the crease between Rio’s inner thigh and pussy as they kissed hungrily.</p><p>When her fingers finally slipped between Rio’s inner lips, slick and hot, Rio broke the kiss with a gasp, her breath coming fast. “Agatha, I need you— Stop teasing.”</p><p>The professor smiled and did exactly the opposite of what Rio had asked. She got up, leaving a turned on and confused Rio on the bed.<br/>“If you touch yourself again, you’re gonna fucking regret it.”</p><p>Rio looked completely entranced as she watched Agatha undress— far less delicately than Rio had moments ago. She left her underwear for last, and when she slipped it down, there was no mistaking the wet stain at the center, a small but telling patch of her arousal soaking the fabric. Without hesitation, she tossed the underwear onto Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Didn’t you say you missed my taste?” she asked, tilting her head toward the underwear. Then, locking eyes with Rio again, she added, “Then go ahead.”</p><p>“You want me to lick it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She brought the underwear to her mouth and dragged her tongue slowly across the soaked fabric. Twice. </p><p>Now Agatha was the one with a dripping cunt.</p><p>She climbed back on top of Rio, taking the underwear from her hand and tossing them across the room. “You’re fucking hot when you do what I tell you to.”</p><p>“I nearly come when you use your Witch voice on me.” Rio admitted, pulling at Agatha’s hair to draw her into a kiss. But Agatha resisted this time. </p><p>Even with Rio’s grip tight in her hair, she didn't give in. Instead, she lowered her mouth and wrapped her lips around one of Rio’s nipples. The sharp inhale that followed was almost drowned out by the sound of the sheets being yanked as Rio’s hands flew from Agatha’s hair to clutch the sheets instead.</p><p>Agatha took her time worshipping Rio’s boobs— her mouth wrapped around one nipple while her fingers massaged or smoothly pinched the other, drawing out soft moans and gasps that made it sound like Rio might unravel from that attention alone.</p><p>She still hadn’t fully satisfied her craving for the feeling of Rio’s nipples on her tongue, but with the way Rio writhed beneath her, Agatha knew it was time to move lower. She traced her tongue down the valley between Rio’s breasts, leaving a wet trail over her stomach, until she reached her clit.</p><p>Rio let out a loud, guttural moan the moment Agatha sucked her clit. Just once. Agatha immediately pulled back and raised her head.</p><p>“You’re not coming until I tell you otherwise. Understood?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>“Rio, did you understand?”</p><p>“Y-yeah.”</p><p>Agatha lowered herself again, using her fingers to spread Rio’s inner lips. Then, she dragged her tongue over her pussy, slowly, controlling the pressure with precision. Rio was a mess— knees folding, hips lifting to give Agatha more access.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t want more access. She wanted obedience.</p><p>She pinned each of Rio’s thighs down with her hands, fingers digging into her flesh, holding her exactly where she wanted her while she ate her out.</p><p>“Agatha— Please—“ </p><p>Agatha licked her like a woman dying of thirst, and Rio’s juices were the only thing keeping her from dehydration. She lowered her mouth even further, sliding her tongue inside Rio’s pussy, thrusting in and out as she fucked her with her tongue.</p><p>Rio trembled, moaning curses and sounds that were like music to Agatha’s ears.</p><p>When Rio’s shaking grew more violent, Agatha pulled her mouth away and glared at her.</p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut, her hands gripping Agatha’s head, trying to force her back down. Agatha resisted the pull, but Rio didn’t loosen her grip. </p><p>Agatha rose up between Rio’s legs, wincing at the pain of her hair being yanked so hard.</p><p>“You’re not being a good girl right now, are you?” She said threateningly. </p><p>Rio let out a frustrated groan at the distance between them.</p><p>“No! Wait, I promise—“</p><p>Agatha ignored Rio’s pleas as she sat up, watching where Agatha was going. The older woman walked to Rio’s closet and returned moments later with a belt in each hand.</p><p>“You <em> are </em> going to behave.”</p><p>She tied each of Rio’s wrists to the bedposts, stretching her arms out, immobilizing her.</p><p>“Agatha, fuck— I promise I’ll be good—“</p><p>“You don’t have a fucking choice now.” Agatha positioned herself between Rio’s legs again. “You better not come, hear me?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for an answer— she shoved two fingers into Rio’s pussy. </p><p>Rio’s moan turned into a scream as she slammed her head back into the pillow, and Agatha kept fucking her with relentless force.</p><p>By that point, Agatha could feel her own arousal dripping down her thighs, and when she glanced down, she saw it pooling on the mattress. Her gaze returned to Rio— a beautiful, tied mess— and she put even more strength in her arm to see how far Rio could hold without disobeying her.</p><p>“A-Agatha— I’m gonna come, please—“</p><p>Agatha smirked and added a third finger.</p><p>“FUCK—“</p><p>She could feel Rio’s walls clenching around her fingers, and Agatha knew that even the slightest curl of her fingers would make Rio explode.</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t— I’m—“</p><p>Agatha stopped thrusting but kept all three fingers buried inside her cunt.</p><p>“You wanna come on my mouth or my fingers?” Agatha decided to play nice for a second.</p><p>“Your—your mouth, please—“</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>When Rio lifted her face, it was wet with the tears that had streaked down her cheeks, and Agatha felt like a fucking goddess for having caused it.</p><p>The moment their eyes locked, Agatha, still buried deep inside, began lowering her head slowly with Rio watching intently.</p><p>With her lips against Rio’s clit, Agatha locked eyes with her and murmured,</p><p>“Then come for me, my love.”</p><p>She pulled her fingers out only to slam them back in at the same moment she sucked Rio’s clit into her mouth.</p><p>Rio’s orgasm was violent. Her hips jerked up, but Agatha was quick to shove them back down against the bed as the student screamed and moaned, trembling while Agatha never let up. Not with her fingers, not with her tongue.</p><p>Only when Rio came down from her high —sweating, hoarse, her head sunk into the pillow— did Agatha finally pull her mouth away. She slowly slid her fingers out of Rio’s cunt, drawing a weak, shuddering whimper from her. </p><p>Rio lay motionless, utterly wrecked.</p><p>Agatha untied Rio’s arms, which fell limply onto the mattress, clearly too weak to move.</p><p>She remained on top of her, though now her whole body was pressed against Rio’s. Agatha lowered her face to her neck, kissing and nibbling at her pulse point, then behind her ear.</p><p>“You did so good.” She murmured, biting her earlobe. “Well, I had to tie you up first, but still.” She smiled against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“I’ve never come that hard in my life, fuck—” Rio whispered, her voice still hoarse from all the times she’d screamed. And even though Agatha was still riding the high of watching Rio completely unravel beneath her, her own pussy was clenching around nothing, wetness slick between her thighs.</p><p>Still lying on top of her, Agatha shifted slightly to the right, angling her soaked pussy against Rio’s hand resting on the mattress.</p><p>Rio realized what was happening and adjusted her hand, three fingers extended so Agatha could sit on them— and she did. </p><p>Agatha moaned as she felt those fingers sink into her cunt. While Rio thrust her hand upward to fuck her, Agatha rocked her hips, riding her fingers, using Rio’s shoulder for leverage.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Agatha moaned. Rio could feel Agatha’s legs starting to shake from the relentless rhythm, and she quickly rose to switch positions.</p><p>At least, that’s what Agatha thought, until Rio climbed off the bed, legs still unsteady, and went to grab the strap-on.</p><p>Agatha wanted to warn her— given how fucking horny and wet she was, Rio wouldn’t need much to make her come. Especially since she’d nearly come just from making Rio fall apart.</p><p>Rio put on the harness and adjusted the strap in record time.</p><p>“I wanna hear you scream my name.” Rio walked back toward the bed, her gaze locked on Agatha, who lay on her back, propped up on her elbows. “I’m gonna fuck you until you can’t remember anything else, but my name.”</p><p>God, Agatha was weak in the knees for her. </p><p>“Come here.” Agatha ordered, but Rio had other plans.</p><p>In one swift motion, Rio yanked Agatha forward by the ankles, dragging her to the edge of the bed with surprising strength. She hoisted Agatha’s legs over her shoulders, and as soon as they were in place, Rio rubbed the strap through Agatha’s slick folds, coating it in her juices.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?” Agatha smirked, her voice low and daring. “You need me to order you to fuck me?”</p><p>Rio let out an ironic chuckle, her dangerous gaze sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine. Before Agatha could push her buttons any further, Rio snapped her hips forward and sunk the entire strap in— all the way.</p><p>Agatha screamed.</p><p> </p><p>It was sometime in the middle of the night when the two of them collapsed onto the mattress, absolutely spent. Agatha had given up trying to keep track after the fourth time she came— after Rio had fucked her against nearly every surface in the room. The bed, the armchair, the door, the floor… Agatha had bruises from being pressed against hard surfaces, not to mention the bite marks, hickeys, and scratches left behind by Rio.</p><p>They had taken a shower together, though that swiftly turned into a quickie under the water. Extremely quick, since Rio was annoyingly mindful about water conservation, which had made Agatha laugh at her student's eco-conscious mindset. Of course, that laughter was soon swallowed by moans when Rio got on her knees and started going down on her.</p><p>Now, back in bed, they lay under the covers. Agatha was nearly asleep, turned away from Rio, who was tracing light patterns across her back and running her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio whispered, pressing a kiss to her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha held her breath.</p><p>“I know you’re not ready to say it back yet— but I fucking love you.” Rio said softly, her lips brushing against the back of Agatha’s neck. “Now sleep, love.”</p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>The next day, Agatha woke up with a familiar and welcome soreness in her body— one of the reasons she’d already been awake for over twenty minutes while still lying in Rio’s bed. It wasn’t the only reason, of course. Not even the main one. For at least twenty minutes, Agatha had been gently caressing the length of Rio’s arm, which was draped across her body, while the student continued to sleep peacefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was taking full advantage of the solitude and calm that early Sunday mornings offered. Before she had to go pick up Nicky, before she had to revisit what she would say to Lilia, before Rio could question her about having called her ‘love’ the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t said it lightly. Not that she’d planned to declare her feelings for Rio mid-sex— especially not a declaration of love that, as much as she was still internally accepting it, she hadn’t been ready to voice yet: she was, undeniably, falling hard for Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it was the heat of the moment that made her say it. The adrenaline of having Rio’s body under her hands again. The rush of hearing her own name spoken like a prayer from Rio’s lips. It could’ve been any number of reasons that made Agatha Harkness call Rio ‘love’ (and mean it) just a few hours ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was definitely not here, in her arms, with the sound of the TV drifting into the bedroom and drawers and cabinets opening and closing in the kitchen, that Agatha would get to the bottom of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? Wake up, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her face the other way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio… Baby…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her whole body away from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed and decided to start the morning on her own, despite the loud presence of Gulliver on the other side of the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No fucking way!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m telling you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I seriously doubt it, I mean…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s so hard to believe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You failed an entire class because </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> student was cheating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I failed an entire class after I found out it was the third time that same student had cheated in my class and nobody even bothered to tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice cackled, slapping the arm of the couch, while Agatha sat at the other end, lips pressed together in a tight smile. They’d been chatting for a while, each with a mug of hot coffee in hand, the TV playing some morning show Agatha didn’t recognize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus fuck, Alice, I thought a hyena had broken into the apartment.” Rio grumbled as she walked into the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww, did I wake up sleeping beauty?” Alice teased, watching as Rio marched over and flopped down between them— though noticeably closer to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha placed her mug on the floor next to the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hair was messy, and she pulled on Agatha’s arm to wrap it around herself.  “As a matter of fact, you did. And your constant laughing must have woken up Agatha too. </span>
<em>
<span>Why</span>
</em>
<span> are you laughing? University is kicking our asses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t wake anyone up!” Alice defended herself. “Well, except for you, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held back from kissing the top of Rio’s head— despite already having been caught mid-make out by Gulliver before, those had been spontaneous moments, not premeditated ones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, she settled for the comforting scent of Rio’s hair, only inches from her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She really didn’t, Rio. I tried waking you up a few times…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or you could’ve just stayed in bed.” Rio muttered, clearly irritated by Agatha’s decision to leave her sleeping alone. Not that it had ever been a problem before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, opening her mouth to ask if a bug had bitten Rio’s ass to justify that mood, but Alice was already talking, wearing a cocky smile, “Don’t worry, Rio. I’ve been a lovely host to our guest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was even more confused when Rio’s body suddenly went rigid in her arms, or why she immediately kicked Alice in the leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch, bitch—“ Alice complained, trying to retaliate, but Rio was faster and pulled her legs in.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Cut it out, for fuck’s sake.” Agatha spat, her patience for their physical back-and-forth wearing thin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No further kicks were exchanged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stood up, flipped Rio off, and Rio returned the gesture just in time before Alice disappeared down the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell was that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to face Agatha. “I wanted to enjoy you in my bed, not wake up to you and Alice laughing in the living room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fucking snorted, laughing right in Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you jealous of your best friend? Rio, for the love of god—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not jealous, Agatha. I just had a different idea of how this morning would go after the first time you called me love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laughter died in her throat, replaced by a soft, affectionate smile. She tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You heard that, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, all teeth. “You’re pretty talented, sweetheart, but you calling me love? That blew my mind. And my clit, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a laugh, a few snorts escaping too, which seemed to diminish some of Rio’s bad mood. The student kissed her, not caring one bit about the strong taste of coffee on Agatha’s tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you liked me calling you that so much last night, then why the grumpiness this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, a soft minty breath from the toothpaste brushing against Agatha’s nose. “Because last night was perfect, and I thought we’d have the morning just to ourselves. In bed. Since you have to leave in the afternoon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, wrapping both arms around Rio’s waist. “I came out to make myself some coffee, and Gulliver was already here. Was I supposed to just ignore her?” She asked with a teasing grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could have. I ignore her all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “Weren’t you the one who asked me to be nice to her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yessss,” Rio groaned in mock frustration. “Can we go back to talking about you calling me love instead of my roommate? Please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does that mean I can get used to being called love by the most feared and terrifying Witch of Westview University?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp, high laugh while Rio gave her puppy eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I said it once. Don’t go having any ideas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What ideas? That you're finally surrendering to my charm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm, I guess you can consider me surrendered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, all traces of her earlier mood completely gone. She grabbed a fistful of Agatha’s hair to pull her face closer, their lips almost touching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what are you waiting for? Don’t you wanna see if calling me love will make me come on the spot?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laugh was muffled by how close their mouths were.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On the couch? In the apartment you share? I think I’ll have to restrain myself.” She bit her lip, as if it physically hurt not to say the word again. “We don’t want to be googling upholstery cleaning services on a Sunday, do we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio’s turn to laugh, but instead of keeping the banter going, she closed the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Keeping the kiss socially acceptable for the shared living room, since there was someone else still in the apartment, Agatha pulled back but kept her hands on Rio’s lower back, gently caressing over her hoodie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but… That means I’m your love, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t push it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“First you leave me alone in bed, and now this… I’m really going through it today, I’m telling ya.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can go back to bed now and watch that documentary you’ve been nagging me about. How’s that sound?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love when you’re romantic.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>The problem with the beginning of relationships was exactly that: intense and subconscious attachment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Considering this was the second beginning of the same relationship —where the initiation and experimentation phases had already been checked off and they were deep into intensification— Agatha tossed and turned all night in bed without Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite her daily grumbling complaints about waking up every morning trapped under Rio’s grasp, she fucking missed her. After less than a day, jesus fucking christ. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio —a force of nature with unmatched intelligence and a beauty that turned heads wherever she went— was, in fact, a big baby when she slept. Over the past week, there hadn’t been a single day where Agatha didn’t wake up to Rio’s steady breathing against her neck, her arm draped over Agatha’s waist, and her feet tangled between Agatha’s calves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except for the day before, of course. The one where she had to pick up Nicky from his dad’s and was forced to sleep in her own bed— cold, uncomfortable, and far too empty. She loved her son more than anyone else in the world, but that Monday morning, yawning on her way to work after a night of miserable sleep, she briefly considered sending the kid back to his dad’s for a few more days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she parked the car, Agatha knew there was no more avoiding the inevitable meeting with Calderu. She had far bigger and more complicated problems than a cold bed or her son keeping her from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had rescheduled the meeting with Rio and Danvers to be able to knock on Lilia’s door first thing in the morning. And so she did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia opened the door with a polite smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Agatha! Everything okay? How’s Nicholas? Oh, I miss that kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had been a constant presence during Agatha’s pregnancy and the challenging early years of Nicky’s life. Motherhood didn’t come naturally to her, and Nicky wasn’t exactly an easy baby either. Lilia had been there, beside them, for years... Until life got in the way: Lilia accepted the position as Dean of the university, and Agatha took on more and more responsibilities in pursuit of her academic tenure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at her, and the two sat down at the small meeting table inside Lilia’s office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s great. Getting taller by the minute and way too smart for his own good.” Agatha joked, making Lilia laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia got up and walked to the coffee machine on the wall perpendicular to where she sat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s always been so smart. You should bring him by sometime. I’m sure he’d love our new field. Is he still into soccer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really… He says our feet weren’t made to move like that. He’s into basketball now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia let out a laugh so loud it drowned out the coffee machine, and for a moment, Agatha let her shoulders relax. While the coffee brewed, they chatted about the upcoming winter break, Agatha’s visit to Salem University, and the success of the course she and Danvers were teaching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, small talk was only going to last so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, are you going to tell me why you’re really here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were seated across from each other, and Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee to buy herself a few more seconds. It didn’t make a bit of difference. Lilia was already watching her with curiosity— and if Agatha didn’t know her so well, she might have thought she saw a touch of apprehension in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no point in dancing around it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got involved with a student. She wasn’t my student at the time, but… Now she is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was obvious Lilia had been expecting anything but that— especially not from one of the most respected professors at the university.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only sound for a few moments came from Lilia’s nails tapping against the wooden table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said </span>
<em>
<span>got involved</span>
</em>
<span>, past tense. Is it over?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. We’re together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia, this won’t affect my ability to teach or my impartiality.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is she from your department? Which student?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal. No… She’s enrolled in the course I’m teaching with Danvers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The name clearly struck a chord. Lilia’s eyes widened, and she slapped the table with an open palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your course assistant?! Agatha, you should know better than to appoint your girlfriend as your TA! You know that could turn into a major problem if anyone suspects favoritism. That is absolutely not acceptable at this university.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck. Agatha pressed her lips together, but she didn’t even get the chance to speak before Lilia barreled on, words flying out at ten miles a minute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You couldn’t wait until the course was over to tell me? Do you have any idea the position you’ve put me in? Who else knows?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, Lilia. Look, I came to you because a student saw us together this weekend. I didn’t want some twisted version of the story getting to you before the truth did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know how fast gossip spreads among students…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do. I could try to remove her from my course—” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that would come at a huge cost to Rio, but… one fucking problem at a time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia shook her head sharply. “No, that could backfire. She could accuse you of penalizing her because of your position here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t believe for a second that Rio would ever do that to her, but right now, arguing with Lilia didn’t seem like the smartest move. “How much is this going to impact my chances of getting tenure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She dreaded the answer. Of all the years she’d spent at the university, this was by far the worst time to get involved in a scandal, especially one involving a student. Still, a small sliver of hope lingered in Agatha’s mind, considering Rio wasn’t even in her department. Thank god for the hippie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia must have sensed Agatha’s unease the moment she brought up the one thing that mattered most in her career: tenure. It was what most professors aspired to— Agatha included. Primarily after dedicating her entire life to academia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Dean placed a hand gently over Agatha’s on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You still have my recommendation and my support, Agatha. But I can’t promise the same from the faculty peers or administrative bodies once this gets out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha muttered a quiet “fuck” under her breath, and Lilia gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t the kind of relationship that should be public knowledge right now, but I think we both know it’s only a matter of time once a student starts talking. My advice? Keep doing the excellent work you’re known for. Don’t listen to the gossip, and Agatha… Don’t engage in any kind of conflict with anyone, no matter what you hear. Understand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It sounded simple enough. Agatha nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t simple. In the slightest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only three days after her conversation with Lilia, the rumors were in full swing. Whispers in the hallways, murmurs in the classroom. The looks she got from some students —half curious, half knowing— were infuriating. Unbearable. But she followed Lilia’s advice and didn’t engage, even when her face constantly burned with rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is, until her peace in the faculty lounge was shattered, by none other than Ralph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How naive of me to think you picked Vidal for her brains.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been making herself a cup of tea at the counter when she turned around to face Ralph, who stood there with a cocky smile on his chapped lips. She wasn’t the only one caught off guard by the inappropriate and completely uncalled-for comment— Wanda, who was seated at one of the tables waiting for Agatha, widened her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What exactly do you mean by that, Ralph?” Of course she knew what he meant, but she wanted to see if he’d own his words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Coward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t. Are you suggesting I picked my assistant based on her looks? Because she keeps my bed warm? Does that same disgusting logic apply to Kaplan too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He stood with his arms crossed, leaning against the doorframe, and let out a nervous laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, your words, not mine.” He said, raising his eyebrows. “Not that I care about that twink, but if you two are looking for a fourth…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was literally speechless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shot to her feet in an instant, positioning herself between Agatha and Ralph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The university is aware of their relationship, Ralph, and Agatha’s standing hasn’t changed because of it. But I swear on your miserable ass, if that comment reaches the Dean’s ears, no one’s going to say the same for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, she’s the one fucking a student and suddenly I’m the one under threat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and moved around the table, stepping directly in front of Ralph. If he could have melted into the doorframe, he would have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better watch your mouth. I mean it, Ralph.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shrugged like he didn’t care, but the look in his eyes betrayed him— like a cornered kid. Before any of them could push the argument further, the door swung open, and Alice walked in, forcing Ralph to take a clumsy step forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whether Alice noticed the bitter tension between the professors or not, she didn’t show it. She simply looked at Agatha with concern. “Professor Harkness, could you come with me for a moment?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m in the middle of something here.” She glared at Ralph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily for him, Alice said the only words that would stop Agatha from tearing him apart right then and there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck </span>
</em>
<span>were you thinking?!” Agatha spat the moment she stepped into the lab where Rio was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the way there, Alice had brought her up to speed. Apparently, there had been a heated argument at the end of Kale’s class —one that nearly turned physical— after a student made a crude comment suggesting Rio had gotten into Agatha’s pants to secure good grades and strong recommendations for her PhD candidature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>According to Alice, Rio had, in fact, lunged at the student and would’ve landed a hit if she hadn’t been held back just in time. The only reason she wasn’t being formally penalized was because it was considered an isolated outburst, one that didn’t reflect her usual behavior. As long as it didn’t happen again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Given the state Rio was in when Agatha entered the lab, it was extremely clear this could very well happen again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear to god, I’ll make that bitch choke on her own words—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was pacing around one of the lab benches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, do I really need to explain how thoughtless that was? You got lucky Kale actually cares for you!</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! That bitch got lucky ‘cause Alice was there to hold me back!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for a few seconds, trying to recompose herself. First her students, then Ralph, now Rio. She was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> close to snapping. And nobody would want to be around when that happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached for Rio’s arm, stopping her from pacing, because that was just adding to her aggravation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood face-to-face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you don’t care about what happens to you, fine, fuck it. But do you have any idea what all of this could do to </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> career? Did that even once cross that stubborn head of yours?” Agatha questioned, half expecting Rio to tune her out completely. Once Rio got stuck in one of her anger loops, especially when it veered into physical aggression… Getting her back to reason was nearly impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have the time or opportunity to fuck some sense into her right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, her hazel eyes wide and burning, twice their usual size. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean? Your career? What’s going on? You said your talk with Lilia was okay!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just because I’m not at risk of getting fired or losing my research projects doesn’t mean everything’s perfect, Rio! I’m up for tenure this year, and having rumors flying around about me and my student-slash-girlfriend getting into fights isn’t exactly helping my case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed and uncrossed her arms, clearly rattled by the news.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know that— Fuck.” She ran a hand through her hair. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How was I supposed to know you’d lunge at another student?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have any idea how many people have come up to me asking what you’re like in bed? Or worse, asking if what we have is serious enough that I wouldn’t consider bringing in a third person?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better a third than a fourth.” Agatha muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing— Look, part of the reason I was worried about this getting out was exactly this. This right here. I’m doing my part to make sure it doesn’t derail my career. And honestly, Rio, if I can’t trust you to help me protect that…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re </span>
<em>
<span>seriously</span>
</em>
<span> saying that? That you don’t trust me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not saying I don’t trust you—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, you are! You just said it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Deep breaths. More even deeper breaths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her watch and realized she had ten minutes to be in her classroom— on the other side of campus. Not exactly comforting either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have time to argue with you right now. I do trust you. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be willing to go through all of this. So don’t you dare redirect your anger at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nine minutes and a few seconds, and Rio’s eyes were starting to fill with tears. No one was cutting Agatha any fucking slack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a frustrated sigh— at the situation, not at Rio. But Rio didn’t see it that way, and the tears started falling faster than she could wipe them away with the sleeve of her sweatshirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The regret of even bothering to talk to Rio hit Agatha like a punch to the gut, along with the mental overload of everything that had been spiraling over the last few days. In moments like this, nothing sounded more appealing than slipping back into old habits: shutting down communication and isolating herself until the tension passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that such strategy had worked long-term with Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pressing her fingers against her tired eyelids. “Rio, come on—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry— Shit, I didn’t know about the tenure thing. I… I almost ruined everything for you, fuck, I didn’t know it was that serious. If I had, I would’ve been so much more careful, I wouldn’t have pushed—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>The situation was messy, and the consequences could be serious, but Agatha couldn’t help the wave of guilt that washed over her as she watched the student crumble in front of her. She was mentally and physically drained, but it was too late now to pretend they could undo the path they’d already set in motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She threw her arms over Rio's shoulders and pulled her into an embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t do any of this out of obligation, okay? I’m just asking for some patience while we navigate the next few weeks. This will be old news eventually, and people will move on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I seriously doubt that. Now that they know you gave </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> a shot, they’ll be lining up at your office door hoping to get the same luck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted at the terrible joke —she assumed it was a joke— and pulled back slightly so she could look into Rio’s still-watery eyes. She gently brushed a few strands of hair out of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got a class to teach, so I need to go.” She stroked her cheek softly. “No more confusion, please, Rio. Especially in class tonight, no matter what you hear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay… Can I see you before class? I’ll bring us something to eat. I know you’re always starving before that lecture.” Rio gave her a lopsided smile, and Agatha melted on the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, baby. See you later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t let her go without a quick kiss, and Agatha left with the sound of her heels echoing down the hall, determined to break a new personal record for fastest time crossing campus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of her afternoon passed without any new surprises, including the snack Rio brought for them to share in Agatha’s office, and their walk together to the lecture hall. They didn’t walk hand in hand, not wanting to fuel the gossip any further, but there was no point in pretending they couldn’t be seen together either. Especially since Rio was responsible for setting up the equipment before Agatha could start her class. And that day, specifically, she was also helping distribute graded papers to the students.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surprisingly, the chatter was minimal, though the attention paid to their every move had doubled. The entire room was silent as Agatha pulled the thick stack of papers from her bag, Rio standing in front of her, waiting for further instructions. The moment Agatha handed the stack over, their fingers brushed involuntarily, and mocking whistles echoed through the room, reaching the ears of the person with the least patience left to spare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her hand back as soon as the papers were fully in Rio’s grasp. She turned to face the students, her eyes scanning the area the whistles had come from. “Who did it?” She asked once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked, who did it?” She asked twice, voice sharper. When no one answered, she climbed the steps toward the row she was certain the sound had originated from. Some students were clearly trying not to laugh, while others looked like they’d rather face the devil than meet her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could pull the security footage and find out which one of you thought you were being funny. That would definitely eat up a good portion of class, one I absolutely won’t be rescheduling. If you had the courage to whistle, you should have the balls to own up to it. So let’s try this again, shall we?” Her voice was fierce and her eyes were narrowed. “Who did it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few seconds passed before two students, both guys, raised their hands in admission. No surprises there. Agatha placed one hand on her hip and pointed the other toward the lecture hall door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out. Both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of them let out an exasperated breath. “I-I’m sorry, Professor Harkness, it was just a dumb joke, I swear it will never happen again—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it won’t. Unless you’re aiming to fail this course. But today? Your little joke just cost you.” She nodded towards the door. “Out. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped aside to let them pass, both of them keeping their heads down. Cowards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she made her way back down to the front of the room, Agatha spoke in her usual commanding tone, “In case it’s not clear yet, I don’t tolerate childish behavior. Not in my classroom, not anywhere.” She turned to Rio, maintaining a respectable distance. “So I suggest you all start using your time more wisely… Like, say, studying. These grades are abysmal. Vidal, pass those out and take your seat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a quick nod and obeyed. Always her obedient girl. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together to suppress a smile, and launched into her lecture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>That same night, Agatha had gone home with Rio, since on the evenings she taught that course, Nicky always stayed over at Wanda’s. They were sprawled out on the couch, one at each end, each with a laptop resting on their legs. Agatha was working on one of the papers she co-authored with William, while Rio was reading through reference articles for her master’s program.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After hours of silence, Rio shut her laptop with a snap and set it on the coffee table. Noticing the professor had no intention of doing the same, she leaned over and plucked Agatha’s laptop, still open, right out of her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey! What—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m exhausted.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, how bad for you, but I was still working.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored the complaint and draped herself over Agatha, settling between her legs and forcing her to make room. With one elbow sunk into the couch cushion and her chin resting on Agatha’s stomach, she looked up at her like a lost puppy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even try to hide the smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re cute and all, but I was really working.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the only night of the week we have together, so… No more work, otherwise you’ll end up magically summoning even more of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not sure that’s how it works.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lowered her head and gave Agatha a playful bite through her shirt, earning a retaliatory squeeze to her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but seriously, can we talk about today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was so done with talking for the day, but she knew Rio operated on a different wavelength, and in the end, she had promised to work on that particular skill of hers. A skill with… A lot of room for improvement. So yeah, that was not the time she would cut herself some slack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Such enthusiasm…” Rio teased, slipping a hand under Agatha’s shirt and resting it on her ribcage, just beneath her bra.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t look like you want to do much talking either.” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow and glancing pointedly at Rio’s hand on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The student gave her a gentle squeeze, thumb pressed just over the fabric of her bra. “Well, I do.” She said, grinning when Agatha placed a hand at the back of her neck. “We’re good, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, we’re good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even after everything? I didn’t think you were gonna go full-on Witch on those clowns.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today was not the day to test my patience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even though you looked hot doing it…” Rio smirked, “Wasn’t that exactly what the Dean told you not to do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I was asserting control over my classroom— something any respectable professor would do, and I made it clear I’m not going to tolerate that kind of behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was just a whistle, love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Rio, it was a fucking act of disrespect and a kind of behavior that’s never been, and never will be, allowed in my class.” Agatha muttered, remembering another certain person’s behavior that had surely been out of proportion. “And I don’t know what you are talking about when you almost punched a student today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed while Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still wanna punch her, but—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed again. “But I won’t. I promise. It won’t happen again. Even if some people seriously deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it.” Agatha muttered, her thoughts drifting back to her fight with Ralph earlier. It had been one hell of a long day, and that particular confrontation was not something she intended to unpack with Rio. The last thing the younger woman needed was fuel and a ‘justified’ excuse to want to punch a professor next time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, she gave a summarized version of what had happened earlier while the two of them gathered their things and headed to the bedroom. Rio huffed and muttered a few curses, but considering there were no audible threats of her jumping down Ralph’s throat, Agatha counted it as a success.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, in bed, their clothes were long gone, and Agatha was on top of Rio, sliding her hand between her thighs— carefully avoiding the spot Rio had already begged her to touch at least three times since soft caresses had turned into hair pulling and desperate kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled against her lips when Rio’s insistent hand grabbed her wrist again, as if the older woman needed any help finding her way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Desperate much, are you?” Agatha whispered, lowering her lips to her pulse point, where she bit down with the clear intent of leaving a mark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shiver was unmistakable as her hands gripped Agatha’s head, fingers tangling in her hair. "I always am with you, but especially after sitting through hours of your lecture, watching from the back… Fuck. I spent every fucking second dripping wet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked and lowered her face further, lips closing around a nipple. Rio moaned loudly, her grip tightening in Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a loud pop, Agatha released it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now that everyone knows you’re the one who gets to fuck me, I didn’t think you’d still be this desperate.” Agatha spoke, referencing one of the kinks that Rio admitted to having months ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laugh melted into another moan as Agatha gave the same attention to her other hardened nipple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Agatha, I’m fucking desperate to feel you inside me.” Her voice was full of pleading, and Agatha, always the most attentive when it came to Rio, gave her one last heated, equally urgent kiss before getting up to fetch her harness and strap-on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She silently thanked her 6 am self for waking up early just to sneak the dildo into the charger in the bathroom before starting her day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was still dark when Agatha's doorbell rang, jolting her awake. She shot up in bed, dragging the covers with her— along with an arm and strands of Rio’s hair that had been tangled between their bodies as they slept, entwined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio startled just as much, either from the noise or from Agatha moving as if the bed had suddenly caught fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“W-what’s ha-happening—“ Rio mumbled groggily, but Agatha was already slipping into her robe and rushing toward the stairs, gripping the railing tightly to keep her hurried steps from tripping over themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flung the door open with a loud thud, coming face-to-face with a sleepy Wanda in pajamas and Nicky, his hair disheveled, eyes red-rimmed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s been crying asking for you for hours," Wanda said. ”I tried to calm him down, but nothing worked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was already clinging to her waist. Agatha was still a little disoriented, and Wanda’s words took a moment to register.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, okay— thank you for bringing him. Do you want to come in?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll head home. We’ll talk tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, watching as Wanda turned back to her car before closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was still holding onto her tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Keeping one hand on her robe to make sure it stayed in place, since she was naked underneath it, she gently grasped his shoulders and crouched down to his level. “Honey, what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you. I said I didn’t wanna go!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced. “I had to work, honey, I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You and dad always have to work, all the time.” He uttered, tears threatening to spill from his brown eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled him into a hug. He rested his chin on her shoulder as she ran her fingers through his hair. “I’m really sorry, my sweetie. We will do better, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, I wanna sleep with you tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How do you explain to an eight-year-old that there’s a woman in his mother’s bed? Or worse— how do you explain the green object he’d probably trip over?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha needed to think fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, let’s go to your room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, my bed is way too small for both of us!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not too small, honey. We used to sleep in your bed all the time, re—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio’s sleepy voice called from halfway down the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both Agatha and Nicky turned to face Rio, and Agatha breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that, at the very least, Rio put on clothes before going downstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Nicky asked, his confusion evident. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze flickered between her and his mother, clearly trying to figure out why his mom’s colleague was standing in their house in the middle of the night— wearing his mother’s pjs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a fucking ounce of slack indeed.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>There were two options, and Agatha only had seconds to make one while her son’s big brown eyes —puffy from crying and full of confusion— searched her face for an explanation only a mother could provide.</p><p>Option one: Omit. There was absolutely no way she could explain her relationship with Rio to Nicky, crouched in the hallway in the middle of the night, on a school night no less.</p><p>Option two: Lie. Say Rio was there because of some problem at her house, something complicated enough to discourage more questions from an eight-year-old. Something involving a name long and tricky enough to make him nod and go to bed. And of course, if he asked, Rio had no family or other friends to crash with.</p><p>The problem was that the moment she gave an excuse from option two for Rio’s presence, she would have to wait a long time to tell Nicky the truth about them. Because even though he was just a kid, he was sharp enough to connect the dots the next time Rio’s name came up.</p><p>Agatha chose to stay as close to the truth as the situation allowed.</p><p>“Rio’s sleeping over tonight, sweetie. She was here helping me with some work stuff.”</p><p>Nicky glanced sideways at Rio again— who stood frozen halfway down the stairs, wide-eyed and visibly unsure whether to run back up or down.</p><p>“Hey there, kid.”</p><p>“Hi,” He mumbled, before turning back to his mom. “That’s not fair.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened instantly, her heart skipping a beat. Shit. Had Nicky clocked both of them? She swallowed hard, masking her nerves with a faint smile as she ran a hand gently through her son's messy hair.</p><p>“What do you mean, Nicky?”</p><p>“You never let my friends sleep over. But your friend can? That’s not fair, mom. It’s really not.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath of relief. For a short time.</p><p>Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Nicky cut her off, turning his suspicious little face back toward Rio— who, by the way, was still frozen in the exact same damn spot.</p><p>“Where is she sleeping?” He asked Rio directly, but didn’t wait for an answer. “Mom, is Rio sleeping in my room? Why did you say we should sleep there if she’s already in my room?”</p><p>Double shit. Agatha knew all those logic-based toys and child development books would come back to bite her in the ass someday.</p><p>“She’s sleeping on the couch, Nicky.”</p><p>“But the couch is down here, mom.”</p><p>Had he become a fucking detective since she last saw him that morning? Jesus fuck. </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, and Rio finally took the cue to move, stepping carefully down the stairs toward them.</p><p>“I heard the doorbell and went to call your mom, Nicky. But she was already downstairs.” Rio answered for her.</p><p>Agatha forced a smile and nodded, confirming the story— one so full of plot holes any adult would see right through it. Thankfully, her son was still a child, and his lack of malice allowed him to believe the words of two grown-ups without question.</p><p>“Oh, okay…” </p><p>“Why don’t you head back upstairs to your room, sweetie? Mommy will be there in a second.”</p><p>He hesitated but eventually agreed, mumbling a quiet goodnight to Rio before heading back up.</p><p>Once they were alone downstairs, Agatha stood up, grimacing at the pain in her knees from crouching so long, and turned to Rio.</p><p>“I just need this day to end before anyone else starts questioning our relationship— fuck.” She muttered, running a hand over her face, visibly worn out from the awful turns the day had taken.</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together, stepping closer to place her hands on Agatha’s tense and knotted shoulders.</p><p>“What happened? Wasn’t he supposed to sleep at the Maximoffs’ tonight?”</p><p>“He was. Wanda said he wouldn’t stop crying, kept asking for me… So she brought him here. She couldn’t calm him down enough to convince him to stay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, love.” Rio murmured, squeezing her shoulders softly. “I can sleep on the couch. Really. It’s no problem at all.”</p><p>“No.” She glanced toward the stairs to make sure Nicky had really gone to his room.  “Wait about ten minutes, then come back to my bedroom. That couch is way too uncomfortable for you to spend the whole night on.”</p><p>“Are you sure? I really don’t mind.”</p><p>“Yes, baby, I’m sure.” Agatha gave her a tired smile. “Just… Please wake up early tomorrow, so he doesn’t realize you didn’t sleep out here.”</p><p>“Of course, yeah.” </p><p>They shared a quick kiss, and Agatha headed upstairs to Nicky’s room.</p><p>-</p><p>The night was… Eventful.</p><p>Agatha had one of the worst nights of her life, coming to the unfortunate realization that Nicky had been right: that bed was, in fact, way too small for the both of them.</p><p>At least Rio had done as she asked. When Agatha finally escaped to her own room to shower, Rio was already gone. By the time she and Nicky made it downstairs, Rio was up, pouring coffee and pulling toast from the toaster.</p><p>The two women exchanged smiles as Nicky got started on his cereal.</p><p>“Hi, Rio! Is your back hurting from sleeping on the couch?” Nicky asked while pouring cereal into his bowl.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow at him and grinned. “No… Why? Should it be?”</p><p>“I dunno. One time my mom slept on the couch and her back hurt for like, three days. I’ve slept there before, and I was fine.” He shrugged. “But you’re younger than her, so… Maybe that's why? I don't really know.”</p><p>Rio snorted. Agatha narrowed her eyes at Nicky.</p><p>“Are you calling me old, young man?” Agatha used her mom voice, making Nicky widen his eyes at Rio, who was barely holding back another laugh.</p><p>“Of course not, momma!” He set his cereal bowl down on the counter and rushed over to hug Agatha.</p><p>She chuckled, pressing a kiss to the top of his head.</p><p>“Don't take too long, okay? We're leaving in ten.”</p><p>“Can I eat my cereal on the couch?”</p><p>“Yes, but if you spill anything, no more food on the couch for two months—" Before she could even finish, Nicky was already dashing away, milk sloshing dangerously close to the edge of his bowl.</p><p>Agatha groaned but didn't call him back, valuing her brief moment alone with Rio.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked, watching as Agatha placed both hands on her lower back and stretched backward.</p><p>“I need to buy him a new bed if this starts becoming a regular thing.” Agatha said, grabbing one of the coffee mugs Rio had made and taking a sip, savoring the caffeine. It was the first of many doses she would need if her exhaustion was any indication.</p><p>“I’ll bring lunch to your office today and give you a massage.”</p><p>Agatha smiled over the rim of her mug.</p><p>Before she could reply, Nicky shouted from the living room, “MOM! Uh, can you bring a napkin? Or, like… Ten?”</p><p>-</p><p>As expected, Agatha dragged herself through her morning classes, yawning more times than she had all week combined. With only a few weeks left until winter break, she was quickly running out of patience and time. William needed to be reminded, yet again, that he was running late on returning graded assignments, and she expected everything on her desk yesterday. Of course, she wouldn’t be nearly that polite about it. </p><p>Not after spending the night shaped like a damn tetris block in a child’s bed with her son’s elbow trying to puncture her stomach.</p><p>“Where’s the grade spreadsheet for the Law and Psychology class?” She asked as William closed her office door behind him, laptop in hand.</p><p>“Should be in your inbox?”</p><p>“Are you asking me or telling me?”</p><p>For two classes straight, students had been asking for updates on their performances. Exams were around the corner, and so was the collective panic.</p><p>“I did share it with you, but…” He set the laptop down in front of hers. “My university email is giving me headaches. I’ve already contacted IT—“</p><p>“Not my problem.”</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry. But the sheet is ready, I just need to regain access to my account. Shouldn’t take long to re-send it.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded. </p><p>They worked in silence for several minutes until she noticed he had forgotten to cite one of the references in the article they were co-authoring— an article she was planning to submit for publication before the end of the year.</p><p>She let out an exasperated sigh loud enough to catch William’s startled gaze.</p><p>“Are you that much of a genius now? Developing theories without backing them up?”</p><p>William’s eyes widened further. “Uh... No? …What?”</p><p>“Then why the hell did you write something that’s clearly a paraphrased quote with no damn citation?”</p><p>“Oh shoot, I did? God, I’m so sorry—“</p><p>“You’re in grad school and still struggling with something they teach in undergrad? Or high school, if the school’s even halfway decent?”</p><p>“Sorry. It won’t happen again, Agatha.” </p><p>The tension hung in the air for a second before the office door opened, and Rio came in— calm and smiling, as always. Agatha shifted her gaze back to William.</p><p>“Fix it. Now.”</p><p>“Yes, of course— I'm opening it right now.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows as soon as she stepped inside, instantly picking up on the tension in the room. Agatha’s sharp tone paired with William’s panicked one didn’t require a genius to decode the situation.</p><p>Still, Rio walked around the desk and placed a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Hey… Everything alright in here?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha replied flatly, while Will just nodded, eyes glued to his laptop screen.</p><p>Noticing neither of them was in the mood to engage, Rio gave Agatha’s shoulder a light squeeze and moved to the couch, laying down with her phone to let them work.</p><p>A few minutes later, another frustrated sigh escaped Agatha’s lips. Both students looked up.</p><p>“There are two students— brothers, cousins, or just random people with the same last name. I don’t care. Am I supposed to guess who’s who? Is it that hard to type first and last names on your goddamn spreadsheets?”</p><p>She knew she was being harsher than usual, but could anyone really blame her? Everyone made a point of respecting how stressed students were in the final stretch before winter break, but no one ever asked how the professors were holding up while juggling grading, exams, and their own mounting deadlines.</p><p>Besides the chaos in her professional life. The nerves around needing to talk to Nicky about Rio weren’t doing Agatha’s temper any favors. Add to that the lack of sleep and the physical discomfort… </p><p>William bit the corner of his lip, his voice barely above a whisper. “I— I hadn’t noticed they shared a last name. Sorry.”</p><p>“Right. Good thing it’s only the first week of class, huh? We’ve had <em> so </em>little time to notice such trivial things.” </p><p>Rio, worried that Agatha might launch the sharpest pencil on her desk directly into Will’s face, abandoned her phone on the couch and walked over to them.</p><p>“Um, Agatha?” </p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Aren’t you hungry? Lunch break started like fifteen minutes ago.”</p><p>“We’re working, Rio.”</p><p>“I know, I’m just saying Will needs his lunch break too.”</p><p>Will immediately looked up. “Oh no, I’m fine. We can keep going.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the silent look Rio shot the guy and the subtle hand gesture telling him to run while he still could.</p><p>“I brought lunch for us, like we agreed on, remember? It’s going to get cold…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but gave in, slamming her laptop shut with the kind of frustration that trusted Apple had made sturdier devices since the last time she cracked a screen on a particularly awful day by not so kindly shoving it into her bag.</p><p>“Fine,” She rested her back on the chair. “Go. You have until the end of the day to fix the spreadsheet and the article.”</p><p>Before Will could fully exit the office, Agatha called after him, “And William?” He turned around, and she murmured, “Do better.”</p><p>He whispered another apology and left.</p><p>Rio let out a low whistle.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha, what happened to my sweet girlfriend from this morning?”</p><p>“She was in the presence of her eight-year-old and forced to behave sweetly.” Agatha pushed the chair back and stood up.</p><p>As she passed Rio to head to the couch, the student slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her in, earning an irritated exhale through Agatha’s nose.</p><p>“God, love, I can’t even touch you today?”</p><p>“I’m just in a really bad mood.”</p><p>“To put it mildly.” Rio cupped Agatha’s cheek, gently brushing her thumb beneath her bottom lip. “What happened earlier? You looked like you were ready to murder poor Will any second.”</p><p>“Incompetence. That’s what happened.”</p><p>“He’s not even remotely incompetent, love. You know that.”</p><p>“If he weren’t, I wouldn’t have to keep calling him out on basic mistakes.”</p><p>“Just because he forgot to write the students’ full names?” Rio smiled, but not even her charming grin could soften Agatha’s rigid posture.</p><p>“Because he’s wasting my time, my patience, and what little energy I have left.” </p><p>“Daaamn— okay, love, okay.”</p><p>“And it’s not your job to defend your friends to me. Let alone decide when my assistant gets to take his lunch break.”</p><p>“I didn’t decide that, the university did, but sure…”</p><p>“Are you deliberately trying to piss me off today? Of all days?”</p><p>Rio dropped her hand from Agatha’s face. "No. I just came to have lunch with my Agatha. I didn’t expect to find her possessed version instead.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and pulled herself out of Rio’s grasp.</p><p>Lunch was mostly quiet. </p><p>There were a few brief remarks about Rio’s morning classes and the difficulties she was facing helping some undergrad students handle lab equipment. Most of the time, Agatha’s only response was a nod or a short answer, because her mind was already mapping out the hours after five pm. When she would pick up Nicky. What she would say to her son, who still had no idea his mom was a lesbian. Not that she had ever introduced him to a man before, but she feared he might be too young to understand what she was about to tell him.</p><p>After one of Agatha’s generic replies, once they had finished eating, Rio called her out.</p><p>“Are you even listening to me?”</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times in her direction. “Yes, I am. Just a lot on my mind.”</p><p>“Then talk to me, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, and Rio scooted closer on the couch, placing her hand over Agatha’s. “I need to talk to Nicky about us. And, by extension, talk to Paul too… I haven’t spoken to him since the day I threw a backpack at his face.”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell them if you’re not ready.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. She wasn’t feeling too ready to make their relationship public either, and look how that had turned out.</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together under Agatha’s gaze. “Look, I’m not going to force you into anything. I feel bad about how people found out about us here, not to mention the whole situation with your job… I’ll respect whatever you decide. I mean it.”</p><p>“I don’t think there’s ever going to be a perfect time to tell him, so I’d rather just do it now. At least this way, you can come over more often— not just when Nicky’s at his dad’s.”</p><p>“You sure?”</p><p>“No. But I don’t know when I ever will be.”</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha had been home with Nicky pestering her for hours, and she still hadn’t so much as mentioned Rio’s name to him. They’d already had dinner, Nicky had finished his homework, and now they were both on the couch, his damp hair soaking through the fabric of her sweatpants as he lay with his head in her lap, eyes glued to the TV.</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“There’s something I want to talk to you about.”</p><p>If that sentence had been aimed at an adult, it would’ve triggered at least one anxiety attack and skipped three heartbeats. But her sweet eight-year-old son just shrugged, still staring at the screen.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She waited for him to at least turn around, but he didn’t move a muscle. Agatha nudged his shoulder, and he rolled to the side slightly— still keeping an eye on the TV. </p><p>It was going to be impossible to have any kind of conversation with that damn thing on.</p><p> “Pause the movie and let’s go make some hot cocoa in the kitchen.”</p><p>Once he’d paused it and they made their way to the kitchen, Nicky hopped up onto one of the stools, watching his mom move around to make a beverage she didn’t even want.</p><p>She considered diving straight into the Rio Vidal conversation, but something Nicky had said in the middle of the night had been occupying a significant part of her mind ever since. The way he had seemed so upset about not getting enough attention, or maybe just noticing how much his parents worked, had stuck with her more than she expected.</p><p>Not that Agatha believed that was truly the case— at least not on her end. She took a deep breath and tried to keep her voice steady.</p><p>“What happened last night? You’ve always loved sleeping over at the twins’ place. Did something happen that made you feel unsafe? Or that made you feel like you needed to come home?”</p><p>Nicky dropped his gaze to his small hands, fidgeting with his fingers.</p><p>“Nothing happened. I told you— I just missed you.”</p><p>“We’ve been together all week, Nicky. Every day after I pick you up from school, we do everything together. You even help me make dinner sometimes.”</p><p>“I know, mom.”</p><p>“Thursdays I’m teaching an extra class at the university, and I can’t leave you home alone, sweetie. That’s why we agreed you’d stay at auntie Wanda’s. You remember that, right?”</p><p>He sighed. “You told me it wouldn’t be forever! Why can’t I go with you? I can stay in your office, I promise I won’t touch anything.”</p><p>That hit Agatha hard. From across the kitchen island, her heart sank a little. </p><p>She walked around to his side, where he had already turned on the stool to face her.</p><p>“There’s only a few more weeks, okay?” She reassured him, cupping his face the same way she used to when he was a toddler. “Next time, I’ll pick you up from school and you can hang out in my office until class. After that, I’ll set you up in the corner of the lecture hall with my iPad so you can watch a movie until my class is done. Deal?”</p><p>His whole face lit up.</p><p>“Yes, momma! I’d love that!” He said, throwing his arms around her.</p><p>She kissed the top of his head.</p><p>“Everything okay at your dad’s? Is he spending time with you?”</p><p>“Yeah. He asks about you a lot, though.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows, not entirely pleased. What exactly was Paul so curious about that he felt the need to ask their kid instead of just picking up the phone and calling her? Well, she’d find out soon enough— she had already decided she’d talk to him when dropping Nicky off that weekend.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to her son’s forehead and stepped away to finally make the hot cocoa. </p><p>Now came the second part of the conversation. God, she hadn’t talked this much since she forced herself into therapy a decade ago. No wonder she had quit.</p><p>As she reached up into the cabinet for the ingredients, she glanced back at Nicky, who was watching her.</p><p>“Were you okay with Rio sleeping over last night?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Yeah, I guess. She’s cool.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, pouring the sugar and cocoa powder into the pan.</p><p>“Yes, she’s very cool. We’ve been friends for a while.”</p><p>Not exactly true, but there was no way she was going to tell her kid she jumped Rio’s bones before even knowing her age.</p><p>Nicky, clearly not taking the conversation too seriously, stretched his arms across the counter to grab one of the drawings he’d left there earlier that day.</p><p>Agatha added the milk to the pan and turned on the stove, keeping her back to Nicky— hoping that this lowkey coward move might give her a bit more nerve.</p><p>“Would it be okay with you if she came over more often?”</p><p>“I think so… But then can my friends sleep over too?”</p><p>“You know the rules about sleepovers.”</p><p>“Mom! Why can your friend sleep here but mine can’t? It’s just Billy and Tommy, and I sleep at their house all the time. You said it yourself!”</p><p>Agatha lowered the heat on the stove and turned to him. He was crumpling the corners of the paper in his hands, clearly annoyed by what he saw as an unfair rule about whose friends were allowed to sleep at their house.</p><p>“Actually, sweetie, Rio is more than just a friend of mine.”</p><p>He lifted his gaze toward her with a look she immediately read as confusion— or maybe denial?</p><p>Agatha stepped toward the counter quickly, her movements wide and rushed.</p><p>“I know this might be hard for you to understand, and I know I’ve never brought anyone home before, and it’s not fair for me to just drop this on you.” His expression didn’t shift, and she found it impossible to shut up. “I know you probably have questions, especially because your dad has been married for so long… I never wanted to introduce you to anyone unless it was something serious. And it is. With Rio.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t say a word. He just looked down at his drawing and kept folding the corners of the paper. Definitely not the best way to respond in front of a mother whose emotions were already all over the place.</p><p>“Nicholas, I’m talking to you. Don’t you have anything to say?”</p><p>He looked back up at her. “Are you guys getting married?”</p><p>Agatha was stunned. What the fuck? Where did that come from?</p><p>“No?” Too quick. She cleared her throat. “I mean, we’re in a relationship, Nicky. Marriage is something that comes much later. Why are you asking?”</p><p>“Dad is married.”</p><p>“He got married after dating your stepmom for years.”</p><p>He tilted his head and raised an eyebrow. “Were you already dating her when she helped me with my school project?”</p><p>“No, we were just friends back then.” Again, not exactly true, but there was no way to be fully transparent about how things started with Rio, not to an eight-year-old. So, half-truths would have to do.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, still baffled by Nicky’s complete lack of interest in asking anything beyond whether she was going to marry Rio. She turned back to the stove to finish the hot cocoa, tossing in a handful of chocolate chips while Nicky stayed focused on turning his drawing into a paper airplane.</p><p>Waiting for the chips to melt, she glanced over her shoulder at him again.</p><p>“You really don’t have any questions for me? You can ask whatever you want, Nicky. I know this is a lot to take in—“</p><p>He cut her off. “I have another science project coming up. Can Rio help me with it? Since she’s your girlfriend now and all.”</p><p>Stunned. Again.</p><p>“Uh, yes… I’ll ask her, but I’m pretty sure she’d love to help you.”</p><p>Nicky grinned and didn’t add anything else.</p><p>Agatha exhaled and finished making the beverage.</p><p>As she set two mugs on the counter in front of him, she looked up at him. “Is it okay with you that your mom is dating another woman?” She asked, hoping to put to rest any idea that this might bother him.</p><p>He looked at her like she had suddenly grown three heads— seconds away from calling her Fluffy.</p><p>“…Yeah?” He drew out the vowels. “Why”</p><p>“Just asking.”</p><p>“My history teacher is married to my art teacher, don’t you remember?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“They’re super cool! Does Rio teach at your job too?”</p><p>Oh fuck. Rio was supposedly her colleague— at least, that’s what she’d told Nicky when they first met.</p><p>“No— she works there through a master’s program.” Screw it. He was way too young to grasp that Rio was, in simpler terms, a student.</p><p>And just like she expected, Nicky simply nodded.</p><p>“Cool,” He said, grabbing one of the mugs. “Can we invite her over tomorrow?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Sure, sweetie.”</p><p>He grinned, grabbing one of the mugs so they could head back to the couch. Agatha briefly considered banning the drink —especially after the mess he’d made with his cereal that morning— but chose to let it go.</p><p>Even though the conversation had gone far smoother than she anticipated, there was still a nagging feeling in the pit of her stomach. It had been too easy. And then, of course, there was still Paul. Not that he had any say in who Agatha chose to date, but he had a knack for getting under her skin, and if he made any inappropriate comments —about the age gap, the power dynamic, or literally anything else— Agatha might need something a little heavier than a backpack this time.</p><p>-</p><p>Later that night, Agatha was in bed, phone in hand, and calling Rio. The student answered the call on the first ring.</p><p>
<em> “Hey, love.” </em>
</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha replied, smiling to herself.</p><p><em> “To what do I owe the pleasure of you calling me at..." </em> Rio paused, <em> "Eleven forty-two at night?” </em></p><p>“God, it’s late, isn't it?” Agatha let out a breath through her nose. "I just got out of the shower."</p><p>
<em> “Yeah? What you wearing?” </em>
</p><p>Agatha could practically see the smug smile on Rio’s face. She chuckled.</p><p>“That’s not why I called you, you dork.”</p><p>Rio laughed. <em> "One of these days I will talk you into phone sex.” </em></p><p>“Uh-huh, sure. One day.”</p><p>They fell into a brief silence, and Agatha rested her head against the headboard.</p><p>“I talked to Nicky.”</p><p>
<em> “How did it go?” </em>
</p><p>“Surprisingly well, actually. He didn’t seem to care at all.”</p><p>
<em> “See? You were freaking out for nothing." </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t love the comment, but she just rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Whatever. Let’s see how he feels tomorrow, after he’s slept on it.”</p><p>
<em> “He’ll be fine, love. You raised him well. He’s a great kid.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha gave a faint smile. "I guess.” She sighed. "Anyway, he asked if you could spend the day here tomorrow. Are you free?”</p><p>
<em> “You know I’m always free for you.” </em>
</p><p>“It’s not just for me, and you know it. Nicky requires a lot of… Energy.”</p><p>
<em> “I’ll have a big coffee before I get there.” </em>
</p><p>“And bring me one, will you?”</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>-</p><p>Rio rang the Harkness doorbell fifteen minutes early. Which meant thirty minutes earlier than Agatha had actually expected her to show up.</p><p>“Shit, shit—“ Agatha muttered, tossing the dish towel onto the counter so she could yank off the apron hanging around her neck.</p><p>She was supposed to have thirty more minutes. That was enough time to at least tame her hair, which was currently pulled into a very poorly executed ponytail, with strands escaping in every direction around her face. It was enough time to apply some blush on her pale cheeks. To exchange her reading glasses for contacts.</p><p>Not that Rio had never seen her with messy hair, glasses, and no makeup. But it was usually just one of those things— not the full combination that screamed not Professor Agatha Harkness<em> , </em> but rather Mom of a kid who asked for chocolate pancakes last minute.</p><p>Agatha opened the door with one hand while the other adjusted the waistband of her jeans.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was the little gap in Rio’s teeth from the wide smile stretching across her face.</p><p>“Hey, again,” Rio said, looking a little nervous to be there. </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha smiled. </p><p>Rio looked her up and down, and when her eyes returned to her face, it was a look of pure adoration despite Agatha being well aware of her messed up state.</p><p>“Can I kiss you?” Rio whispered, clearly worried Nicky might be within earshot.</p><p>She would soon learn that with Nicky, you heard him before you saw him.</p><p>“Yeah— he’s upstairs in his room.”</p><p>Rio barely waited for her to finish the sentence before crashing her lips into hers. Agatha smiled into the kiss, grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling her inside, away from the prying eyes of nosy neighbors.</p><p>“You taste like coffee. Where’s mine?” Agatha asked, glancing at Rio’s empty hands.</p><p>“I drank it at home ‘cause I didn’t wanna be late… And I figured you wouldn’t want my cheap coffee when you’ve got the fancy kind here.”</p><p>Agatha giggled. “Fancy? It’s regular coffee.”</p><p>“No, sweetheart, it’s not. It’s cute you think that, though.”</p><p>They heard footsteps creaking down the stairs. See— hear first, then see.</p><p>“Hi, Rio!” Nicky called out as soon as he reached them. “My mom told me you’re her girlfriend now.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together to hold back a laugh at the look of shock on Rio’s face.</p><p>“Uh, yeah— I am.” Rio said, letting out a slightly nervous laugh.</p><p>“My science projects are gonna be the <em> best </em> in class now!” He said, grabbing the sleeve of Rio’s sweater to tug her toward the living room. “Remember that one you helped me with? I got an A+! Momma told you?” He didn’t wait for her to answer. “I have another one to do but it’s super hard. Have you heard of the three R’s?”</p><p>-</p><p>The day went by in perfect harmony between the three of them. Rio was way better with kids than Agatha had imagined. </p><p>After breakfast, where Nicky talked their ears off about his favorite cartoons, toys he’d seen on YouTube and wanted Agatha to buy, and how excited he was to join the basketball team after winter break.</p><p>The chatter got even worse when Rio told him she loved playing basketball too. And it got <em> way </em> worse when Agatha, after a lot of insistence from both of them, agreed to go to a court at one of the nearby parks so they could play.</p><p>At least she used the hours to read her book, her attention occasionally pulled away by Nicky’s outbursts of laughter over some ridiculous move Rio pulled on the court with the ball— clearly with the sole purpose of making him laugh.</p><p>Now, back at home, Nicky was in the shower while Agatha and Rio were in the kitchen.</p><p>“You were great with him today. Thank you for that.” Agatha said, pulling Rio toward her by the collar of her sweater.</p><p>“He’s a great kid, Agatha. I had a blast today.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a genuine smile and closed the space between them. She soon dragged the tip of her tongue across Rio’s lips, asking for entrance, which was granted instantly. Agatha pinned Rio against the kitchen counter and placed a hand on her neck, sliding it up into her hair and giving a light tug, which earned her a low but audible moan against her mouth.</p><p>“Shhh, my kid’s here.”</p><p>When Rio leaned in to kiss her again, the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs reached the kitchen, and Agatha took a step back —which looked more like a jump— away from the student.</p><p>Seconds later, Nicky appeared in the kitchen with his Nintendo in hand.</p><p>“Mom, I was thinking…”</p><p>Oh, boy.</p><p>“I wanna stay here tonight and go to dad’s tomorrow.”</p><p>The two women glanced at each other because it was already pretty much settled that Rio was going to spend the night, since Agatha would be dropping Nicky off at his dad’s later in the afternoon. As in, about an hour from now.</p><p>“Are you sure? You always go to your dad’s on Saturdays.”</p><p>“Yeah. Can’t you call him?”</p><p>“I can, but he’s expecting you, sweetie.”</p><p>Despite Agatha’s docile voice, Nicky frowned, crossing his arms. “You don’t want me here? Now that you have a girlfriend?”</p><p>Agatha tried to keep a neutral expression as she walked toward him. “Of course I want you here. I always want you here, Nicky.” She forced a smile, surprised by the sudden shift in his behavior. “Rio wants you here too, right?” She glanced over at the student.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, definitely.” </p><p>Nicky looked at Rio briefly but then turned his gaze back to his mother, standing right in front of him. He clutched the device against his chest.</p><p>“Will you call dad?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll call him right now.” </p><p>The two women watched as Nicky walked across the kitchen to pour himself some chocolate milk, still acting in a way that was completely different from how he’d been all afternoon.</p><p>Had he expected Rio to be gone by the time he got out of the shower? Had he seen them kissing? Or even just touching, for that matter? Agatha had been particularly careful with displays of affection with Rio, not only because she wanted to slowly ease her presence into Nicky’s life, but also because she was very aware of the jealousy he often felt when it came to her.</p><p>The jealousy theory only grew stronger as the evening went on.</p><p>It started when Agatha went to the office to call Paul. Her home office was one of the few places Nicky rarely ventured into, especially when he had clear plans to play on his Nintendo— a habit Agatha had yet to find any way of curbing. But the moment she sat down in her chair, Nicky came in, walked right over to her, and sat on her lap— something he hasn’t done in years.</p><p>Later, while they waited for the pizza, Agatha and Rio were sitting on the couch, side by side but barely touching, while Nicky was in the armchair playing his Nintendo. They were watching an episode of Friends, and when Agatha let out a loud cackle that caught the boy’s attention, he definitely noticed when Rio briefly placed a hand on Agatha’s leg, near her knee. He stood up from the armchair and plopped himself down between them, forcing a separation so he could nestle into his mom’s lap again before going back to his game.</p><p>After they ate, Nicky didn’t leave them alone even during cleanup. For the first time ever, he volunteered to help Agatha in the kitchen. Not that he actually knew what to do, so in practice, he hovered around her like a security dog while she loaded the dishwasher, with Rio standing near the counter, probably wondering if Nicky was going to bite her in the shins if she got any closer to his mom.</p><p>The thought of Rio simply leaving crossed both women’s minds several times, especially during the moments when Nicky was, for lack of a better word, insufferable. Still, every time Rio hinted that maybe it was time for her to head out, Nicky asked her to stay so they could watch a movie together— one he loved and that Rio had never seen.</p><p>He liked Rio. He didn’t have anything against her. She just apparently wasn’t allowed to touch his mom.</p><p>Great.</p><p>By the fourth or fifth time Nicky accidentally yanked on Agatha’s hair because he was too cramped on the couch but refused to move away from her, Agatha’s patience snapped.</p><p>“Ow, Nicholas!” She muttered. “If you want to stretch out so badly, why don’t you grab some blankets and lay on the floor? This is a couch, not a bed.”</p><p>“No, momma! I’ll stay still.”</p><p>He didn’t, but eventually fell asleep.</p><p>The day had taken a toll on him, and Agatha sighed with relief as she tucked him into bed. He was completely wiped, and so was she after holding herself back several times from scolding him due to his awful behavior that night.</p><p>When she came back to the living room, rubbing her face, she found Rio sitting cross-legged on the couch, wearing a look of sympathy after witnessing firsthand just how much of a handful Nicky had been that night.</p><p>Quiet, Agatha sat on the couch and threw her head back, eyes closed. She should’ve known Nicky would seem okay with their relationship— right up until he actually saw, with his own eyes, Agatha giving her attention to someone else. A consequence of her own choices, one could say, considering it had always just been the two of them.</p><p>“Do you want me to go?” Rio offered, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and gave a tired smile. “You probably should. There’s a good chance he’ll wake up in the middle of the night looking for me.” She reached for Rio’s hand and pulled her into her lap, which the student complied with instantly. “But I really want you here.”</p><p>Straddling her, Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and started to massage them, earning a soft hum of appreciation from the older woman.</p><p>“Sorry about him. I don’t know what got into him— actually, I do. I just—“</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay. It’s very easy to be jealous about you. I mean, I want you all to myself too.” Rio teased, making Agatha chuckle.</p><p>“It will prove challenging if he acts like that every time you’re around.”</p><p>“He’ll get used to it, love.” Rio kissed her. “Besides, he’s gonna want me around when he becomes the best player on his basketball team and has the best science projects in class.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“Good to know you’re putting all that learning to use, baby.” With her hands on Rio’s waist, Agatha pulled her closer. “You must be tired of all the tree hugging and weeding around campus. Speaking of which, there’s a tree blocking the view from my window… You should do something about that.”</p><p>Rio threw her head back in a laugh. When she looked at Agatha again, she was still smiling, her lips finding Agatha’s in a tender kiss.</p><p>“Don’t you ever get tired of teasing me about that? Seriously, it’s been since day one. Literally.”</p><p>“Please, I still hold back a lot.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully, and the peaceful moment between them was interrupted by Agatha’s phone vibrating in between the couch cushions.</p><p>They exchanged curious looks. It was late for anyone to be calling. After all, the only people who could possibly have a reason to contact her at that hour were under her roof.</p><p>It was an unknown number.</p><p>Agatha declined the call.</p><p>“Why didn’t you answer?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Probably a wrong number. Don’t worry about it.” </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow but didn’t push, mostly because she was already being pulled into another kiss.</p><p>The only sound in the room was the wet slide of tongues and the occasional soft moan from Rio when Agatha sucked on her tongue before diving back into the kiss. That is, until the older woman’s phone started vibrating again beside them.</p><p>Agatha groaned in frustration and declined the call once more.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be easier to just answer and tell them they’ve got the wrong number? Instead of declining it like… Who knows how many more times?”</p><p>“Hmm, no.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were under Rio’s sweater again, and just as she leaned in, ready to have Rio’s tongue back in her mouth, the damn phone vibrated yet again—same unknown number.</p><p>This time, Rio snatched the phone before Agatha could, and answered, putting it on speaker.</p><p><em> “Agatha?” </em> Paul’s voice.</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Paul? What number is this? Why are you calling me this late?”</p><p>
<em> “You’re not gonna believe who I ran into. I can’t even believe it myself, but I’m looking right at her.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t like where this was going. She kept her voice casual, ignoring Rio’s increasingly curious gaze.</p><p>“I don’t give a shit. Stop calling me. It’s late.”</p><p>
<em> “Don’t be an ass, Agatha. Here, she wants to talk to you.” </em>
</p><p>A mix of distant voices and music filled the line for a few moments. </p><p>Both women stiffened when a female voice came through the speaker.</p><p><em> “Guess who’s back in town!” </em> Natasha’s voice rang out, cheerful and unmistakably tipsy. <em> “Please say you missed me, hon! But first, tell me, have you grown tired of that little whore already?” </em></p><p> </p>

<p><em> “Guess who’s back in town!” </em> Natasha’s voice rang out, cheerful and unmistakably tipsy. <em> “Please say you missed me, hon! But first, tell me, have you grown tired of that little whore already?” </em></p><p>Agatha took the phone from Rio’s hand before she had any chance to answer, or pull it away, or do anything at all, really.</p><p>She stood up in a quick, sharp motion, making Rio nearly fall sideways on the cushion since she had just been straddling Agatha’s lap moments before. Agatha harshly pressed her finger against the screen to take the call off speaker and pressed the phone to her ear.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?!”</p><p>
<em> “Oh, come on. You can’t be serious that you haven’t gotten bored of messing around with that girl, Agatha.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha was already storming down the hallway toward the kitchen when she felt Rio’s hand catch her arm. She had apparently recovered quickly from the shock of being called a ‘little whore’ by Natasha seconds earlier.</p><p>“I’m not fucking playing— what the fuck are you doing with Paul?”</p><p>“Put it on speaker.” Rio murmured behind her. </p><p>Agatha ignored her.</p><p><em> “I ran into him, hon, relax. Total coincidence.” </em> Nat said, then mumbled something to Paul that didn’t come through clearly. <em> “So, did you miss me? How much?” </em></p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, and just as she opened her mouth to answer, she was distracted by Rio tugging on her arm, forcing her to turn and face her.</p><p>“Put the fucking phone on speaker, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha obliged, legitimately alarmed that the student might start screaming at some point and wake up Nicky, causing hell to definitely break loose at the Harkness’ household.</p><p>She cleared her throat. </p><p>“I’m blocking this number, and you better not show up anywhere near me, Romanoff. I’m serious.”</p><p>
<em> “You should’ve said that to Paul, uhm, maybe ten minutes ago.” </em>
</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“He invited me over tomorrow to meet his lovely wife and, to make the most of my delightful visit, to finally meet your adorable son.”</p><p>It took Agatha a few seconds to process the sheer absurdity and stupidity of Paul’s idea. What possible reason could he have to introduce Nicky to Natasha? What the fuck was his problem? The least he could do was to not fraternize with the person who broke the heart of someone who had once been his closest friend and he allegedly loved.</p><p><em> “Hellooo? Honey?” </em> Natasha sing-songed through the speaker. <em> “Damn, you only ever went this quiet on the phone when you were staring at my tits through the camera.” </em> She burst into laughter, joined by Paul’s chuckle echoing in the background.</p><p>“YOU FUCKING—“ Rio shouted into the phone, but was cut off as Agatha ended the call.</p><p>“You’re just gonna let that slide?! Seriously? That bitch shows up again, and—” Rio was clearly in distress, her voice still loud and echoing down the hallway.</p><p>“My kid’s sleeping upstairs, keep your voice <em> down </em>.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, wide-eyed.</p><p>“You’re mad at <em> me </em>? God—” Rio shook her head. “Your ex shows up, again, and somehow I’m the one you’re pissed at? Have you talked to her since that day?”</p><p>She didn’t need to specify which day she meant.</p><p>“No, and I’m not mad at you, Rio, just, please.” Agatha said, slipping her phone into her pocket as she made her way to her office— the farthest room from the stairs, where Nicky was least likely to overhear anything if Rio decided to escalate this conversation. Which she clearly intended to, judging by the fast steps trailing behind the professor.</p><p>“So she doesn’t know you’re with me? How convenient.” Rio scoffed, pushing the door shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even make it to her chair before Rio’s words stopped her in her tracks. She turned around.</p><p>“Do you mean something by that?”</p><p>“It’s convenient that she thinks I’m… What did she call me? A<em> little whore </em> to you.”</p><p>“You cannot be fucking serious right now.” Agatha hissed. “First you had a nuclear meltdown because I wanted to talk to her, and now you’re pissed that we didn’t talk? Make up your damn mind, Rio!”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together.</p><p>“Fuck, now Paul knows about you, and I can’t even imagine what Natasha told him about us— fuck.” Agatha muttered, rubbing her temples, wishing the past few hours had just been a terrible nightmare she could wake up from.</p><p>“You shouldn’t care what he thinks about us. It’s not like he’s part of your life anyway.”</p><p>Agatha snapped her gaze up at her, stunned by the absurd conclusion Rio had reached.</p><p>“Not directly! But he’s the father of my child, which makes him a presence in my life,” She rolled her eyes. “Not that you could possibly understand that.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Come on, Rio. You never take anything seriously.” Agatha crossed her arms, the stress and anxiety of the past week creeping in. “When we were apart, you weren’t even showing up to the lab. And yeah, I know that because Kale paid me a lovely visit to imply it was <em> my </em> fault you were losing your goddamn mind.”</p><p>“It was your fault!” Rio spat. “And I do take things seriously, Agatha. I just don’t obsess over what people I don’t give a shit about think of me or my relationship.”</p><p>“It’s all just so easy for you, isn’t it?” Agatha folded her arms tighter, her willingness to avoid a fight with her kid asleep upstairs flying right out the window and hitching a ride straight to hell. “Doing drugs at a festival where I was clearly uncomfortable? Why the hell not?” She lifted her index finger. “Your own actions leading to us being outed at said festival? Sure!” Up went her middle finger. “The whole university finding out about us? Oh well! Who cares, right? As long as <em> everyone </em> knows who’s in my bed at night.” She raised a third finger. “Everything’s too damn easy for you, and I felt so guilty about hurting you that I buried my own concerns to protect you! Protect our relationship! And look where that’s gotten me.”</p><p>The tears in Rio’s eyes had started falling before Agatha had even raised her second finger, but right now, Agatha was on a warpath, finally voicing —or rather, weaponizing— the things that had been weighing on her chest for weeks. Dealing with the whispers and the looks on campus was bearable, but when the relationship with Rio and her lack of maturity started costing Agatha’s peace with Nicky? </p><p>That was a line she would not cross.</p><p>“You think you have every right to throw all of this in my face, but you forget that what happened at the festival was your fault! You didn’t have to come up to me or be rude to him like that. Maybe if you had been at least a little polite, which is apparently impossible when you think you need to channel the Witch of Westview—“</p><p>“Oh, so if I’d been charming, he wouldn’t have started all the gossip? You can’t be that naive.” Agatha shot back. “And how was I not supposed to come up to you? You could barely stand on your own, and suddenly I see some guy, twice your size, practically on top of you? What the fuck was I supposed to do, Rio?”</p><p>The student stayed quiet.</p><p>“What the fuck was I supposed to do?! Answer me.”</p><p>“I don’t fucking know!” Rio shouted, her voice breaking as tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>“Of course you don’t.” Agatha let out a bitter laugh. “In your head, I was supposed to be all sweet and lovely to a petulant student who called me a milf.”</p><p>“I didn’t say that.”</p><p>“Yeah. Actually, you didn’t say a fucking thing. I don’t know if it’s because you were high as hell, or if, deep down, you agreed with him.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That just like him, you see me as a fucking milf. Is that some ridiculous kink of yours? Is that why you chased me?”</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha, do you hear the amount of shit you’re accusing me of? Are you insane?!”</p><p>Agatha could’ve said yes. That the last shred of her sanity vanished the moment that unknown number flashed on her phone screen, forcing her to deal with Natasha and Paul, on top of her work, the looming threat of not getting tenure, and Nicky’s jealousy.</p><p>For days, the feeling that she was on the verge of a breakdown had been growing steadily, reaching near its limit every time a sharp pain in her head warned her she wasn’t physically (or psychologically) prepared to handle the sheer amount of shit going on. Considering the pack of ibuprofen she had bought less than a week ago had only two pills left, one could say Agatha Harkness was a ticking time bomb.</p><p>And the bomb exploded in her home office with her son sleeping upstairs.</p><p>“It’s a simple question, Rio. Was my age a decisive factor for you?”</p><p>Rio took a step toward Agatha, who instantly stepped back, the back of her legs hitting the desk behind her.</p><p>“No.” Faced with the older woman’s incredulous expression, Rio sighed. “Yes, it’s hot that you’re older than me, but that’s not what drew me to you. To be honest, Agatha, it hurts me that you’d think that after everything we’ve been through.”</p><p>Agatha had one arm crossed over her stomach and the other raised to support her head, steadying her breathing and, hopefully, her voice. She needed to remember that her son was upstairs and that he didn’t deserve —nor could he hear— his mother fighting with the girlfriend she had only just admitted to having 24 hours ago.</p><p>She took a few deep breaths while Rio wiped her face, clearing away the tears that had thankfully stopped falling, much for Agatha’s relief.</p><p>“I’m tired, Rio. I’m fucking exhausted… You should leave.”</p><p>The student’s eyes widened. “I’m not leaving— I’m not leaving like this.” She shook her head, fear clearly visible in her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t have anything else to say to you.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t said it to be final, but rather out of sheer exhaustion and the desire to not prolong the argument any further, not this late at night, and knowing what awaited her the next day. Or better yet, who. Still, Rio’s chest began to rise and fall faster as her breathing grew uneven.</p><p>“No— this can’t be happening again, fuck… No, Agatha—“</p><p>Seeing her like that made Agatha’s chest tighten, and for a brief moment, she wondered which one of them was having an actual anxiety attack— just so she could figure out who needed to be helped first. Or who would have to call 911.</p><p>But the moment Rio crumbled in front of her, Agatha’s question answered itself.</p><p>She took two long strides toward Rio, arm outstretched, but was caught off guard when Rio pulled away from her touch.</p><p>“You don’t get to do this to me. You don’t get to tell me to leave, to shut me out, and then try to comfort me. I won’t accept that.”</p><p>“Rio, I’m not kicking you out— I just need to clear my he—.”</p><p>“You said that I should leave. That you had nothing else to say to me. How does that sound to you?” Rio said through sniffles, her nose running almost as fast as the tears on her face.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving while we’re still fighting. That’s not how this relationship works.”</p><p>“Okay, fine, don’t leave.” Agatha let out a deep breath, running a hand through her hair as she stood in the middle of her home office. Rio was still hovering by the door.</p><p>“Did you mean what you said? Do you honestly believe I’m with you because of some kink?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then why did you say it?”</p><p>Agatha groaned. </p><p>“I don’t know, Rio. Apparently I have no fucking clue what I’m doing anymore.”</p><p>“I’ve told you more than once that I love you, Agatha. Why would I say that if our whole relationship was just about a kink? Doesn’t even make sense!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, okay? I’m just tired. I never should’ve said that.”</p><p>“You can’t throw shit like that in my face when things get hard.” Rio was clearly hurt, and Agatha didn’t know what else to offer besides her apology, especially since the last time she tried to get close, Rio had pulled away.</p><p>Besides, her throat physically hurt, dry to the point of burning, and she briefly considered suggesting they pause the fight just to hydrate.</p><p>But the moment she opened her mouth, Rio’s stomach let out a loud growl that echoed through the previously silent room, and both of them instinctively tried to hold in their reactions— definitely not the right mood for laughter. But neither succeeded, and Agatha was the first to let out a snort nearly as loud as the grumbling from Rio’s hungry stomach.</p><p>“Look, let’s eat something and get a drink, then we can come back to this, okay?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“You’re suggesting we take a break from the fight?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>-</p><p>They reheated the leftover pizza in the oven to avoid the risk of waking Nicky with the noise from the microwave, and both had a bottle of beer in hand as they ate in silence at the kitchen counter. In reality, Agatha barely touched her slice, while Rio devoured the rest of the pizza with a speed that surprised Agatha, though she refrained from commenting. After all, the fight was on pause, not resolved.</p><p>Once she was done, Rio wiped her mouth with a napkin and said, voice just above a whisper, “I’m all good now.”</p><p>Agatha nodded toward the direction of her office again, and with Rio following her, they closed the door once more behind them. Agatha let out a long sigh.</p><p>“I’m tired of fighting, Rio. Really fucking exhausted.”</p><p>Rio crossed the office and sat in Agatha’s chair— the exact same spot, however on the floor, that she had been on her knees months ago, eating the professor out before work. God, Agatha missed simpler times.</p><p>“Me too. Listen, I’m calmer now, and I really want to talk to you. Like, for real,” Rio said, her voice weary. “If you want me to leave, I will— but not before we’re okay.”</p><p>If this much talking was normal in relationships, Agatha was right to have avoided them until recently. Jesus fuck.</p><p>“I already told you— I don’t know what else I have to say to you,” The older woman said, still standing, now leaning against her desk facing Rio. “And I’m not being rude, okay? Before you assume anything.”</p><p>Rio crossed her legs, her head resting against the back of the chair so she could look up at Agatha’s face. “You hurt me with what you said, Agatha.” When she noticed the way the professor frowned, clearly clueless as to which words, aside from the kink comment, had actually stung, Rio continued, “I do not have a milf kink, obviously, and I do care— about your work, your kid, you. I know I’ve made some questionable choices, but it was never out of spite, I swear.”</p><p>“You need to act on it, Rio, because I feel like I’m carrying everything on my shoulders and still have to twist myself into three different shapes just to make sure none of it hits you.”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that to protect me.”</p><p>“I feel like I do, because if I don’t, you’re going to spiral again and start tossing your degree and your whole career like they don’t matter. That can’t happen, Rio. I can’t be responsible for that. Your future can’t depend on our relationship, and, to be fair, the way you acted scared the shit out of me. You can’t ever do that again, okay?”</p><p>“Wait, I thought we were talking this out to fix things—“</p><p>Rio started getting agitated again, and it only took two steps for Agatha to move between her legs, positioning herself close. Rio still had her head tilted back to keep eye contact as Agatha reached out and placed a hand on her face.</p><p>“We are,” The professor reaffirmed. “Baby, you need to treat your studies like a priority, not some inconvenience to toss aside when things get hard.”</p><p>“I know that.”</p><p>“Sometimes it doesn’t look like you do.”</p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, resting her cheek against the older woman’s stomach.</p><p>“Our fight and that whole shitty situation with your ex hit me way harder than I thought it would, Agatha.” Rio’s voice trembled. “Fuck, I’ve never gone through anything even remotely close to that. And never with so many feelings involved.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, feeling a wave of affection for the student who could so openly and convincingly express emotions in a way Agatha wasn’t sure she’d ever be capable of. </p><p>She ran her hand through Rio’s hair, gently stroking the top of her head.</p><p>“We got through that.” </p><p>“I know, but can you understand that her showing up again brings all of it back? And makes me scared we’ll end up in that place again?”</p><p>“Yes, I can.”</p><p>They stayed silent for a moment, Rio’s face resting against Agatha’s stomach, and Agatha stroking her hair, until the student pulled back and stood up. She wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I want to go with you tomorrow. To Paul’s house.” Rio said, quickly interrupting Agatha when she opened her mouth to respond. “He probably already knows about us, and this way Natasha will be sure we’re together. Nicky already knows too. What’s the problem?”</p><p>“It would be a big fucking problem if you punch both Paul and Natasha in front of Nicky.” Agatha replied lightly, but sincerely.</p><p>“If it’s just in front of you, is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha pinched her hip, making Rio jump with a surprised yelp. Agatha let out a low chuckle, but her expression quickly returned to seriousness. </p><p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea.”</p><p>“I’ll be on my best behavior, love, I promise.”</p><p>“Rio, you lost your shit over a stupid thing Natasha said over the phone. Not sure I should trust you’ll be able to keep your cool if she says something like that to your face.”</p><p>“She’s not insane enough—“</p><p>“Yes, she is.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Okay, forget what I want,” she sighed. “But if you go there alone, you know they’ll stress you out to the point where you’ll walk back to your car just to run them over. Then you’ll have to figure out how to pay for Nicky’s therapy for the rest of his life.”</p><p>“I make enough money for that.”</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to chuckle. </p><p>“I promise you, love, I’ll keep my shit together. Let me go with you.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, as she had few reasons to trust that Rio would be able to stay calm in the face of Natasha’s high-level of snark. On the other hand, she also knew she wasn’t in her best mindset to deal with both Paul and Natasha in a few hours, so…</p><p>If hell was demanding her presence, might as well bring company.</p><p>“Okay, fine, yeah.” Agatha blurted out, caught off guard when Rio immediately thanked her with a bunch of kisses: on her lips, the corners of her mouth, her chin, the tip of her nose. “Why are you so cheerful?”</p><p>“Because I feel like you’re finally letting me in.” The student answered between kisses on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Well, if you intend to stay, some things have to change, Rio.”</p><p>Rio pulled her face back, her brown eyes studying Agatha’s expression.</p><p>“Of course I wanna stay in your life— what the fuck?”</p><p>“Your career always comes first. It’s unacceptable that that happens again.”</p><p>“I fucked up, I know. I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p>“I’m not doing you any more favors at the university. Not now that everyone knows about us. No more early access to enrollment links, no assistant positions, and no more tutoring your roommate…”</p><p>Rio pouted. “You’re telling me there are no perks to dating Professor Agatha Harkness? That’s not fair.”</p><p>“Say that louder, I don’t think my students or colleagues heard you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but the smile tugging at her lips ruined any attempt to seem genuinely annoyed.</p><p>“If you offer another course, can I still take it?”</p><p>“That should be fine, but only if it’s related to your field of research. No signing up for my classes just because you have some weird-ass professor kink.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Weird? More like a common kink. I hate your students.”</p><p>“Anyway— only if it’s relevant to your studies.”</p><p>“I guess I could ask Will to keep an eye out on my behalf…”</p><p>“Rio! Focus” Agatha snapped her fingers in front of the student’s face, pulling her attention back. “I don’t want you in the criminal justice department just for shits and giggles, and I definitely don’t want you taking up a student’s spot for no reason.”</p><p>“Okaaay. It’s not like I needed more things to stress about right now.” Still with her arms around Agatha’s neck, she grinned and ran her right hand down the length of Agatha’s hair. “The amount of time I have to spend studying for your class and your assignments… Holy shit, Agatha, it’s more than double for any regular class.”</p><p>“You’ve been spoiled by those hippies.” She rolled her eyes. “By the way, you should be spending triple the time then, because it’s also unacceptable that you got a B in my class.”</p><p>Rio gasped in mock offense.</p><p>“I should be the one saying it’s unacceptable that you gave me a B! Fucking embarrassing. Do you have any idea how much shit Alice gave me over that?”</p><p>Agatha giggled. “She got an A.”</p><p>“Exactly! She said that even though I’m sleeping with you, she still managed to get a better grade than me.”</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing while Rio glared at her.</p><p>“Not funny, Agatha! I deserved an A on that paper.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, love, but you didn’t. It’s okay though—“</p><p>Rio cut her off. “Only you to call me love and stupid in the same sentence. For fuck’s sake.”</p><p>The professor legit cackled. The sound of her own laughter startled her, worried it might reach Nicky’s room, so she buried her face in Rio’s neck to muffle it. Rio tried to hold back a laugh herself, which made her throat let out a weird snort-grunt that sent Agatha into another fit of laughter.</p><p>“I missed this, you know.” Rio said once their laughing fit died down and Agatha lifted her head again.</p><p>She tucked a strand of Rio’s hair behind her ear, and if Rio could catch even half the affection in Agatha’s gaze, she wouldn’t need any other kind of declaration.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her lips spreading into a soft smile.</p><p>“Me too.” She kissed Rio on the lips. “I don’t want to keep fighting with you over the same things.”</p><p>“Me neither. I promise I’ll do better, and I’m sorry for making you carry everything on your own lately.”</p><p>“I’m sorry for all the crazy shit I said today.”</p><p>Rio nodded and closed the space between them again.</p><p>After an embarrassingly short amount of time, Agatha had already made peace with the idea that they were about to have a quickie in her office— with the door locked and a lot of hope that one could make the other come in record time. Considering Rio was already moaning into her mouth without Agatha's hand even moving below her belly button, and Agatha could feel her underwear growing uncomfortably damp… Yeah, they’d manage.</p><p>Just as Agatha pulled away quickly to lock the door, a sleepy voice echoed down the hallway.</p><p>“Mom?”</p><p>Agatha's eyes went wide as she looked at Rio, who straightened her clothes, which, thankfully, were still in place, and ran a hand through her hair. The older woman mirrored the movement, smoothed herself out, and opened the door.</p><p>The two stepped into the hallway and immediately spotted Nicky, his face creased from the pillow, hair tousled, and eyes swollen with sleep.</p><p>“Where were you?” He asked.</p><p>“Working in my office, sweetie. Why are you up?”</p><p>“Hungry.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Mommy can make you some cereal and you can eat it in your room, okay?”</p><p>“In my bed?”</p><p>“Not after the couch incident.” She replied. “You can eat at your desk, but make sure there’s nothing from school on it.”</p><p>He nodded and wrapped his arms around her waist. “Thanks, mom.” Agatha bent down to kiss the top of his head, and only then did he seem to notice Rio standing just behind her. “Was Rio working with you too?”</p><p>“Mm, yes.”</p><p>“It’s late, mom. You always say it’s important for us to get sleep. That’s why I can’t play with my Nintendo late at night.”</p><p>“You’re absolutely right, Nicky. Rio is almost leaving.”</p><p>“She’s not sleeping here?”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a glance, and Rio stepped closer to him, while he still clung to his mother’s waist.</p><p>“Would that be okay with you? If I slept here?”</p><p>He frowned and looked at her like she was dumb.</p><p>“You slept here a couple days ago.”</p><p>“Yeah, I did, but I’m asking if it’s okay with you if I sleep in your mom’s bedroom this time.”</p><p>“Oh.” He seemed to think it over for a moment, like he had a very important decision to make and an audience waiting for it. If the Agatha from nine years ago knew that her future self would be standing around waiting to find out if an eight-year-old would allow a woman to sleep in her bed… </p><p>“Can I still sleep with you if I have a nightmare?” He asked, tugging at Agatha’s sleeve.</p><p>“Of course, sweetie.”</p><p>That seemed good enough for him, and he let go of Agatha. “Will you bring me my cereal, mom?”</p><p>“Mommy will be right there.”</p><p>He gave Agatha another hug, and just before heading to the stairs, he glanced back at both women, a bit hesitant. Before Agatha could ask if he needed anything else, his cheeks turned a little pink, and he ran back to Rio and gave her a quick hug too. She barely had time to return it before he darted off again.</p><p>“See, it’s all good as long as you don’t touch me.” Agatha joked.</p><p>Rio laughed, following her into the kitchen. “Yeah… And, hm, mommy?” She added, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha glared at her.</p><p>“Don’t even.”</p><p>“Today you accused me of being with you saying that I have a milf kink, didn’t you?” Rio smirked. “Come on, mommy, let me have it.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha warned, her back still turned while she reached into the cabinet for the lowest-sugar cereal she could find. She definitely didn’t hear Rio approaching until she felt a warm breath at her ear, followed by a whisper.</p><p>“What? You’re gonna spank me, mommy?”</p><p>The cereal box slipped from Agatha’s hand, sending a cascade of little brown puffs rolling across the counter and onto the floor.</p><p>“FUCK, Rio!” She snarled, whipping around to find herself face-to-face with Rio and that ridiculously smug smile on her gorgeous face. “Drop this mommy shit, I’m serious.”</p><p>“Aww, is mommy upset?” Rio fake-pouted.</p><p>“Rio, I swear—”</p><p>Rio laughed, almost too loudly for a house with a child who was still awake.</p><p>“Hey, I’m messing with you, love.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned back to finish pouring the cereal into a bowl, followed by the milk.</p><p>“You better get your ass out of bed early tomorrow, because you’re cleaning this mess.” She said, heading out of the kitchen. “And turn the lights off.”</p><p>“Aye aye, mommy.”</p><p>Agatha let out an exasperated huff and ignored Rio’s laughter trailing behind her.</p><p>-</p><p>The next morning, Agatha woke up to her alarm at 6:00 am. As per usual, her body was serving more as a mattress than the actual one beneath her— Rio was sprawled out on top of her, breathing softly into her neck.</p><p>Apparently, Rio’s famously heavy sleep didn’t apply when she was under the same roof as Nicky, because when Agatha turned toward her, Rio’s eyes were already open, glowing like flashlights in the dark.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck? It’s sooo early.” </p><p>There was no way for her to know the exact time, but her eyes were probably burning just as much as Agatha’s.</p><p>“We’re going running.”</p><p>“We? No no no no—“</p><p>Agatha smiled as Rio squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head in protest.</p><p>“Oh, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Turned out Rio could be easily convinced to do just about anything, including putting on borrowed gym clothes and running for forty minutes around the same blocks, if Agatha whispered in her ear with that husky morning voice and promised plenty of rewards for the effort.</p><p>After they got back —and after Rio had complained about a misunderstanding that Agatha would reward her during the shower— she headed off to clean up, and Agatha went to wake up Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>Less than an hour later, all three of them had showered and were in the kitchen, in an oddly comforting domesticity.</p><p>“Hey buddy, are you okay?” Rio asked when she found Nicky resting his head on the cool marble countertop in the kitchen.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Are you hungry? I made your favorite pancakes.” Agatha said with a smile, holding out a plate stacked with three chocolate chip pancakes and a definitely pediatrician-unapproved amount of syrup.</p><p>He gladly accepted the plate, forcing a smile that didn’t quite sit right with Agatha. But assuming it was just a little jealousy over Rio being part of their morning routine, she decided to let it go and let him eat on the couch.</p><p>-</p><p>Of all her concerns that afternoon, the regret of letting Rio come along to drop Nicky off at his father’s house was the one that crept up her spine like a chill, despite the fact that Rio had been smiling and, weirdly, way too calm all day.</p><p>A dozen scenarios had already played out in Agatha’s mind as the three of them drove toward Paul’s. She pictured herself having to break up a physical fight— Rio going after Natasha, or after Paul, or even Paul’s wife. God, she’d probably have to shove Nicky in the trunk just to spare him the sordid details of whatever chaos might unfold in the next few minutes.</p><p>What she definitely hadn’t expected, though, was that the thing to stop any fight from breaking out… Would be the sudden need to rush Nicky to the hospital.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Remember what you promised me, Rio.” Agatha said as they were getting near Paul’s house.</p><p>Nicky sat quietly in the back seat, his chin resting in one small hand as he stared out the window, softly humming along to the song on the radio. In the passenger seat, Rio cast a nervous glance at Agatha— the first sign of any emotion other than the oddly calm demeanor she’d been putting on all morning.</p><p>“I know. Trust me, my love, I’ve got it under control.”</p><p>Agatha seriously doubted there was a single thing Rio had under control, but it was too late now. She’d made the stupid decision the night before, in what could only be described as a moment of weakness, and now here she was, pulling up in front of Paul’s driveway.</p><p>“Excited for the week with your dad, sweetie?” Agatha asked, her voice falsely cheerful as she looked at her son in the rearview mirror.</p><p>He grinned. “Yeah! He said that if I do my homework every day after school and eat my vegetables, he’s gonna buy me a new game for my nintendo.”</p><p>Fucking great parenting skills. </p><p>While Agatha had always been cautious about overusing rewards as a parenting tool, Paul apparently handled fatherhood like he was Santa fucking Claus.</p><p>Agatha sighed, but forced a smile for her son, who was practically bouncing in his seat now. As soon as she hit the button to unlock the car doors, Nicky bolted for the front step and rang the doorbell twice.</p><p>Both women stepped out of the car as well. By the time Agatha popped the trunk and grabbed Nicky’s backpack, Paul had already opened the front door. He was crouched down beside Nicky, one arm draped around the boy’s shoulders, looking at whatever he was showing him on his nintendo.</p><p>“Paul.” Agatha greeted him dryly.</p><p>Paul looked up at her, opened his mouth to respond, then saw Rio standing beside her, looking down at him, and promptly shut it. He stood up with a smile Agatha knew like the back of her hand: polite, but wary. </p><p>“Hi, Agatha,” He said, then turned to Rio. “Hey. You are…?”</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes. There was absolutely no way Natasha hadn’t babbled about them the night before. But Nicky beat everyone to it.</p><p>“This is Rio, dad! She works with mom! And she’s her girlfriend.”</p><p>The silence that followed spoke volumes.</p><p>After a few seconds, Rio cleared her throat. “Yes, thanks, buddy.” She ruffled the top of Nicky’s head, making him smile— a gesture Paul definitely didn’t miss. “I’m Rio Vidal. Nice to meet you.” </p><p>She extended her hand, and Paul shook it. "Nice to meet you too, Rio." That damn smile again. "You must be the youngest professor at Westview University. Agatha was already one of the youngest when she started, and I’m guessing she was still older than you.”</p><p>Rio smiled with her lips closed, but it was Agatha who stepped in.</p><p>“I never said she was a professor, but we appreciate the interest.” </p><p>“Oh, my bad!” Paul said, voice tinged with mockery. “What do you do at the university, Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha’s assistant.”</p><p>His brow furrowed for a second before he clocked Rio’s answer and smirked. "Mm, so… A professor’s assistant? Don’t you have to be a student to get that kind of position?”</p><p>It had barely been a few minutes since they arrived, and Agatha’s fingers were already itching to throw the backpack at his face.</p><p><em> Not in front of Nicky </em>. Not in front of their pure, sweet eight-year-old.</p><p>“Like I fucking said, we appreciate the interest, but—” Agatha started to mutter, but Nicky tugged on her hand in protest.</p><p>“Mom! Bad word!”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry.” She forced the words out through clenched teeth. “Mommy is heading home now, okay, sweetie?” </p><p>Before she could crouch to say goodbye and hug him, Paul placed a hand on her shoulder. “Why don’t you both come inside? Clare is making Nicky’s favorite cookies, and Nat should be here any minute now.”</p><p>“Who’s Nat?” Nicky asked, thankfully not noticing how Agatha jerked her shoulder to shake Paul’s hand off.</p><p>“No one. And I’m leaving.”  </p><p>“But mom, dad is asking you to stay, and I want you and Rio to stay too.” He turned to Agatha, his brown puppy eyes so much like Rio’s it caught her off guard for a second. </p><p>“Please, mom! Pretty please!”</p><p>And just like that, Agatha found herself on the couch with Nicky on her lap playing nintendo, while Rio sat beside her, pointing out secret shortcuts in Mario Kart. Nicky, completely absorbed in his game, didn’t even notice how stiff his mom was underneath him, especially whenever Clare or Paul tried to make small talk, none of which interested Agatha in the slightest.</p><p>Paul and Clare were somewhere in the kitchen, as if it took two adults to make coffee, while Agatha quietly took in the sight of a bond forming between her son and Rio. The latter looked completely invested in the game despite not even holding the device.</p><p>Agatha reached out to brush Nicky’s hair out of his face since he kept blowing at a strand that was blocking his view, when the warmth of his skin caught her attention. She moved her hand to his forehead— a motion that earned a groan from Nicky as her fingers accidentally grazed his eyes, causing him to crash into a red shell.</p><p>“Nicky, are you feeling okay?”</p><p>He just mumbled a vague “yeah<em> ” </em>, fully focused on the game.</p><p>Rio looked over the shoulder at Agatha.  “What’s the matter, love?”</p><p>“Does he feel warm to you?”</p><p>Rio, much more careful not to interrupt the kid than Agatha had been, placed her hand on his forehead.</p><p>“Um, kinda?” Rio answered. “But it’s also kinda hot in here.”</p><p>“I guess.” </p><p>She waited until the race was over to try again. She’d always taken pride in not raising an iPad kid, and now the joke’s on her, because apparently she’d raised a nintendo kid. If that was even a thing.</p><p>“How about turning that off for a bit, huh?” Agatha suggested. “Put it to charge so you can play with your dad later.”</p><p>Nicky gave a small, defeated shrug, but didn’t argue. He got off Agatha’s lap for the first time since they had entered the house. Still on the couch, she took the chance to stretch her legs, stiff from having an eight-year-old on them for so long.</p><p>“God, I just want to get the fuck out of here.”</p><p>“Soon, sweetheart.” Rio placed a hand on her thigh, giving it a gentle squeeze, and didn’t move it away. The simple touch made Agatha exhale, tension easing from her shoulders.</p><p>A moment later, Nicky came back, and Rio had to pull her hand away. Not because she felt like she should, but because Nicky would’ve plopped right down on it if she didn’t.</p><p>He settled back onto Agatha’s lap again.</p><p>“Hey, why the long face?” She asked, wrapping her arm around him. “You were super excited in the car, remember? You’ve got a new game coming your way if you do everything right this week, isn’t that true?”</p><p>“Yeah… I’m just tired.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “We barely did anything today.”</p><p>He just shrugged again, his head resting against Agatha’s collarbone. She and Rio exchanged a look, and not long after, Paul returned from the kitchen alone, holding two cups of coffee.</p><p>“I didn’t know how you take it, so I made it the way Agatha likes hers.” He said, handing one to Rio after giving the other to Agatha.</p><p>He sat down in the armchair across from them.</p><p>“So... How long have you two been together?”</p><p>God, he sounded like Agatha’s dad. If she had one. </p><p>It took everything in her not to roll her eyes.</p><p>“Officially? A few weeks.” Agatha answered, taking a sip of coffee.</p><p>“Officially... Wow, so it’s been going on for a while then.” He said it more to himself than to them. “Weird that I’ve never heard about you.”</p><p>“And why exactly would I tell you about Rio, Paul?”</p><p>“Because I think it’s important to know who’s spending time in the house where my son lives half the month?”</p><p>“Oh, right, I thought you only cared about how many…” Agatha bit her tongue before saying whores— his own words against him, but she couldn’t, not with Nicky there. “… Women, sneak out.”</p><p>He scoffed and stood up from the chair. “It’s really hard to have a conversation with you, you know that?” He muttered, heading back to the kitchen.</p><p>Rio’s hand found her knee —the one not covered by Nicky’s little legs— and gave it a reassuring squeeze. Agatha didn’t say anything else. She was so done with this whole fake happy-family charade.</p><p>She leaned toward Nicky to let him know it was time for her to leave, but before she could finish her sentence, the sound of the doorbell reached her ears. Agatha’s stomach twisted once, then again when she caught the shift in Rio’s expression, because she also knew what the doorbell meant. </p><p>Natasha.</p><p>She entered the living room with Paul, both laughing at either a joke or, more likely, at Agatha’s obvious discomfort. The look of shock on Natasha’s face when she saw Rio sitting right beside Agatha almost made the entire agonizing situation worth it.</p><p>“Oh, hey…” Natasha said, glancing between Nicky’s face, then Agatha’s and Rio’s.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha and Rio replied in unison.</p><p>“Are you Nat?” Nicky asked, though he made no move to greet her— and even if he had wanted to, he couldn’t. Agatha was holding him tightly in her arms.</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Natasha smiled warmly. “You must be Nicholas. Your dad talks about you all the time, you know?”</p><p>Nicky tilted his head up to look at Agatha.</p><p>“You don’t talk about me too, mom?”</p><p>“All the time, sweetie.” Agatha kissed the top of his head, catching in her peripheral vision the moment Natasha and Paul sat down in the armchairs across from the couch. She instinctively held Nicky even closer in her lap.</p><p>“Are you dad’s friend, Nat?”</p><p>“Um, yeah… You could say that. I used to be really close with your parents a long time ago.”</p><p>Rio shifted uncomfortably beside Agatha.</p><p>Nicky, ever the curious child, smiled and asked, “Really? You were friends with my mom too?”</p><p>“Actually, Nicky—” Agatha began, but Natasha cut her off.</p><p>“I’ll tell you a little secret,” Nat whispered, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees, getting closer to Nicky. He tried to lean toward her too, but Agatha tightened her arm around him, keeping him firmly in place. “I dated your mom for a long, long time. We almost got married.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes went wide as he turned to Agatha. “<em>MOM</em>! Is that true?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, pressing her lips together. “But we didn’t, and then I had you, which is the best thing that ever happened to me, so I’m really, <em> really </em> happy things turned out the way they did.”</p><p>Her soft words didn’t do a damn thing to slow down the gears clearly turning in his little brain.</p><p>“So, you were mom’s girlfriend like Rio is now?”</p><p>Natasha let out an arrogant little laugh, and Agatha automatically placed a hand on Rio’s leg.</p><p>“No, no, it was a much more—”</p><p>“More what, Natasha?” Rio cut in, her tone sharp and unmistakably threatening. Every adult in the room picked up on it. So did Nicky, who stopped himself from asking another question.</p><p>Agatha was digging her fingers tightly into Rio’s thigh at that point.</p><p>“Let’s just… Not, yes? Not here. Not now.” Agatha said, pressing a kiss to the top of Nicky’s head again. “Mommy will answer all your questions later, okay? Why don’t you go play with your nintendo for a bit while the grown-ups talk?”</p><p>“But you just told me to charge it—”</p><p>Before he could finish, Paul, who had been watching the whole scene unfold with his arms crossed, reached out a hand to his son. “Come here, buddy.”</p><p>Agatha felt instantly exposed —sue her for using her child as an emotional shield— when Nicky slid off her lap and into Paul’s. </p><p>“Clare’s in the kitchen making your favorite cookies, and I bet she’d love your help. She might even let you have a little bit of dough.”</p><p>Nicky loved  dough, but instead of lighting up like usual, he just nodded quietly and made his way to the kitchen, leaving the four adults alone. Agatha’s hand tightened even more around Rio’s thigh. If Rio was in pain, she didn’t show it.</p><p>Once Nicky was fully out of earshot, Agatha turned her sharp gaze on Natasha’s smug face.</p><p>“What the fuck are you even doing here? What’s your fucking problem?”</p><p>“Agatha—” Paul began.</p><p>“Meeting your kid, obviously… And he’s adorable, by the way.”</p><p>“You’ve met him. Now get the hell out.” Agatha spat.</p><p>“Agatha, this is my house. I invited her.” Paul tried, his voice annoyingly calm.</p><p>“Fine. Then stay— catch up! I’m leaving. And Nicky’s coming with me.”</p><p>“You’re not taking him. I’m staying with him this week, and you know damn well, Agatha.” </p><p>Meanwhile, Natasha lounged deeper into the armchair like she was watching a soap opera. “Agatha, I came in peace, okay? Do you have a problem being in the same room with me and your little girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but Agatha was the one who answered.</p><p>“I have a fucking problem with you, period, and the fact that you’re here, forcing yourself into my son’s life? Fucking unacceptable.”</p><p>Paul stepped in again. “Nicky is our son, Agatha. Contrary to what you seem to think, you didn’t make him from scratch.”</p><p>Yeah, as if she needed that reminder. Agatha curled her lip in disgust. Her patience was wearing thin.</p><p>“You brought this situation into your own house, Paul!” Agatha groaned. “You two were never close. You only ever spoke because my then-best friend and my then-girlfriend needed to, at the very least, get along. So why are you both acting like old friends now?” </p><p>“Oh, so you can bring your girlfriend into my house, but I can’t bring an old friend? An acquaintance?”</p><p>“Jesus, dude, still not over her? Get a grip or something.” Rio mumbled, rolling her eyes. Natasha’s face tensed, the insult landing squarely on both her and Paul.</p><p>“I’m not talking to you, am I?” Paul shot back.</p><p>“Talk to her like that again and I swear it won’t be a backpack flying at your face this time.” Agatha hissed, already scanning the room for the nearest throwable object.</p><p>Paul let out a dry, mocking laugh, shaking his head, while Natasha leaned forward with her elbows on her knees, eyes locked on Agatha.</p><p>“Let’s all just calm down, yeah?” She flipped her hair back over her shoulder. “We’re all adults here, and we can talk like it.” Then, she let her gaze flick to Rio and smirked. “Well, almost all of us.”</p><p>“You’re lucky you’ve never caught me alone,” Rio said under her breath. “And you better wish that luck stays with you, until you crawl back into whatever sewer you came from.”</p><p>Natasha’s smug smile faltered for just a moment.</p><p>“Okaaay… ” Natasha said in a mock lighthearted tone, turning back to Agatha with a grin. “How about a joke to lighten the mood?” Before either woman could tell her to shut the hell up, she went on: “More of an observation than a joke, really. But, you know, if we call </p><p>Nicholas back in here, every human being in this room was inside you at some point.”  She pointed at Agatha and let out a loud cackle.</p><p>Paul laughed too, though nowhere near as enthusiastically, and Rio sat frozen, too stunned to even blink. Agatha, however, was the first to snap back.</p><p>“Just shut the FUCK up!” Agatha shouted. “You’re a fucking asshole, and Paul, so are you for inviting her over. What’s wrong with you? You know better than anyone else here what she did to me all those years ago. And you— what? Want to be friends now?” She spat the words like venom. “I know we’re barely friends ourselves, but I thought you at least respected me enough.”</p><p>Agatha stood up, and the other three followed suit.</p><p>“That was years ago, Agatha!”</p><p>“I don’t fucking care. I’m done, Paul. I am <em> done </em> trying to keep things civil between us for Nicky’s sake when it’s so fucking obvious you don’t lift a finger to do the same for me.” She walked around the couch, Rio following closely. “And I’m so done with you too, Natasha. I’m so, so, fucking—”</p><p>“Momma?” Nicky’s small voice echoed somewhere behind Agatha. Clare hovered behind him, clearly having failed to keep him in the kitchen when the yelling started carrying through the house.</p><p>“He wanted to come here, wanting to know why his mom was shouting. Seriously, Agatha—”</p><p>Agatha then reached her breaking point.</p><p>“Shut up. Just— shut. The. Fuck. Up.”</p><p>Nicky’s wide eyes looked up at her, confused and scared. He didn’t reprimand her for the bad word this time— he could tell his mother was in no place to be scolded. Agatha felt like the worst person alive upon seeing her son’s face.</p><p>In the following minutes, hell definitely broke loose in Paul’s household.</p><p>Sure, it was to be expected that a meeting between five adults, each carrying their own arsenal of unresolved resentment, wouldn’t be the best idea. Quite the opposite, actually. </p><p>And the way everything spiraled into chaos within seconds was the biggest proof that Paul’s stupidity had crossed every imaginable line of common sense.</p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>If only Agatha could go back in time and choose a different man for her moment of meltdown and despair… Preferably one who had paid attention in sex ed and didn’t believe the pull-out method was foolproof. </p><p>That’s what she liked to tell herself, anyway, because the alternative was believing Paul had deliberately risked getting her pregnant just for the thrill of getting into her pants.</p><p>Well, that was a problem for a very different moment— because right now, Agatha was watching everything unfold around her in slow motion.</p><p>While Clare demanded some sort of response from Paul about the way Agatha had spoken to her, Natasha and Rio were arguing over how Natasha seemed entirely incapable of leaving Agatha alone.</p><p>Agatha’s name was being said —or shouted— by every single adult in the room, while Nicky stood frozen, horrified, watching the chaotic circus that had taken over since he’d left the safety of the kitchen.</p><p>“How insecure do you have to be to feel this threatened?” Natasha scoffed. “Do you really expect me to believe this relationship after she lied to your face while sneaking out to see me?”</p><p>Rio had one arm raised, finger pointed directly at Natasha.</p><p>“It’s actually pitiful that the only card you have to play is that night. One night. Which, if I remember correctly, ended with you being ditched at a hotel bar.” Rio raised her eyebrows and looked Natasha up and down, pretending to size her up. “Fitting, honestly, for the pathetic person you are.”</p><p>Natasha stepped toward Rio, and Agatha, who didn’t know which fight to jump into first: Clare, who was in the middle of tearing Agatha’s name apart in front of Paul, using every unflattering word she could come up with; or Rio and Natasha, seconds away from lunging at each other’s throats.</p><p>Her decision came quickly.</p><p>“Rio, enough. Let’s leave.” Agatha said, glancing from Rio to Nicky, who had his back pressed to the wall, clearly afraid of getting caught in the crossfire if things turned physical. And honestly, it didn’t look like that was far off for any of them. His eyes were filled with tears, his skin pale.</p><p>Either Rio didn’t hear her, or chose to ignore her, and Natasha was already turning her attention back to the student.</p><p>“Oh, I’m pathetic? I’m at the house of an old friend, where I was invited to, to meet his son, who just so happens to also be the son of my ex-fiancée. If we’re counting cards, I’ve got way more reason to be here than you do.”</p><p>“Nat, calm down—” Paul tried, the tension thick as Clare stormed out of the room with an audible scoff.</p><p>“Natasha, I’m not saying it again,” Agatha raised her voice, cutting Paul off entirely. “I don’t want you anywhere near me or my son. And I don’t give a flying fuck what Paul wants.”</p><p>Natasha threw her hands up, defeated. “Fine, very well— Fuck that. Fuck you, and you,” She even pointed at Paul before locking eyes with Agatha. “Just keep that little whore of yours.”</p><p>Agatha would never claim to have great reflexes.</p><p>She’d tried to be the goalie on her school’s soccer team once, after getting three red cards in three consecutive games. The coach said her reflexes and agility needed serious work before she’d ever be game-ready. So, after promising to behave (or at least make less aggressive fouls), she returned to midfield. </p><p>The goalie phase lasted all of fifteen days. Not long, sure, but maybe just long enough so she could save her son from seeing someone get punched in the face for the first time.</p><p>If shit had already hit the fan before, now there was a cannon of it aimed directly at the center of Paul’s living room. </p><p>During Rio and Nat’s argument, the two of them had ended up gradually moving closer, almost as if their yelling was having trouble covering the distance. They were now on opposite ends of Paul’s arm couch, with no obstacles between them, and Agatha —standing just behind Rio— had the fucking luck of catching the way Rio’s forearm bent back to build momentum.</p><p>Her fist was clenched and aimed straight for Natasha’s eyebrow—who, unfortunately, was slightly shorter than Rio and wouldn’t have had much chance to dodge if Agatha’s fifteen days of goalie practice hadn’t kicked in.</p><p>Agatha managed to grab Rio’s elbow just in time, her knuckles stopping mere inches from Nat’s eyebrow.</p><p>Natasha flinched, stumbling back with a gasp, hands flying to her face as she registered how close she’d come to being hit.</p><p>“You’re fucking insane?! You CUNT!” Natasha screamed in pure rage and adrenaline.</p><p>Rio had a murderous look on her face. And could Agatha really blame her? Hell, she also wanted to punch the life out of Natasha. Badly. But from the corner of her eye, she saw Nicky, frozen mid-step, terror written all over his small face as he watched the whole thing.</p><p>Agatha had one priority now: get her son out of this goddamn house.</p><p>She turned to Rio, gently placing her hand on her cheek and guiding her face toward hers, making sure Rio’s hazel eyes locked with her blue ones.</p><p>“Please, my love.” Agatha said under her breath.</p><p>Rio seemed to snap out of a stupor. </p><p>She blinked several times, her face slowly softening. Her only response was a short nod, just enough for Agatha to feel safe letting go of her, then rushing to Nicky, who looked like a toddler curled into the corner of the room.</p><p>“Hey, hey, my baby,” Agatha cupped Nicky’s tear-streaked face with both hands, dropping to her knees. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>She whispered soothing words into his ear, arms wrapped tightly around him as he clung to her neck like a lifeline. She felt a hand press gently to her back and didn’t need to turn around to know it was Rio.</p><p>While Agatha tried to calm her son down, Paul apparently grew a pair, and finally told Natasha to leave. </p><p>She'd stayed down long enough for her knees to start aching. Still, Rio hadn’t moved from her side, quietly offering her solid, steady support.</p><p>“I really didn’t think it would… Get this far.” Paul muttered, exhausted, as he stepped back into the living room.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away, and Rio probably didn’t trust herself to say anything that wouldn’t start another fight.</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Agatha. Damnit, I shouldn’t have—”</p><p>By then, Nicky had let go of her neck, and she stood up, keeping him safely behind her.</p><p>“I’m going to hold back from saying exactly what you deserve to hear, Paul, because Nicky’s already seen and heard more than enough for one day.”</p><p>Paul nodded and then crouched down, reaching out a hand toward Nicky, whose little face was puffy and red from crying.</p><p>“I’m really sorry too, buddy, but listen… I was thinking, maybe today we could buy that nintendo game you wanted. What do you say?” Paul smiled, and Agatha felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>She didn’t give Nicky a chance to fall for the pathetic bribe.</p><p>“He’s not staying, Paul. I’m taking him home.”</p><p>“What?” Paul stood up straight. “This is my week with him, Agatha. No matter what happened here today.”</p><p>“You lost that privilege the second you made the stupidest decision of bringing her here.” Agatha hissed. “Rio, grab Nicky’s backpack.”</p><p>“Mom—”</p><p>“Agatha, I’ll take you to court if you walk out of here with him.”</p><p>“Mom—”</p><p>“Go ahead! Take me to court!” She snapped, stepping forward. “You know damn well I’ll destroy you. You’ll be lucky if you’re allowed to see him for a single fucking holiday.”</p><p>“Mom—” Nicky tried for the third time, still standing behind her.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio called out urgently, her eyes wide.</p><p>The urgency in Rio’s voice made Agatha turn toward her and follow the direction of her gaze straight to Nicky, who was clutching his stomach, his back arched forward. She was only three steps away from him, and if it had been one step less, the wave of vomit that came out of him would’ve hit her square in the belly.</p><p>She didn’t have any real issue with bodily fluids— especially not from the child she carried for a little over nine months, whose diapers she’d changed, whose baths she’d given, and whose sheets she’d cleaned during the potty-training days.</p><p>But she’d be lying if she said her stomach didn’t lurch when she looked down and saw the mess on the carpet: a half-solid, half-liquid reddish mix that looked far too much like blood.</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha couldn’t quite remember the details of how they ended up in Westview Hospital’s ER.</p><p>She did remember freezing for a few seconds when she saw the contents of Nicky’s stomach splattered across Clare and Paul’s white carpet. She remembered Paul suggesting everyone stay calm while he went to grab some nausea meds. And she remembered how Rio picked up the eight-year-old like he was a baby and said they needed to go to the hospital. </p><p>Rio had driven, Agatha in the backseat with Nicky, holding a paper bag in front of him (which Rio had remembered to grab, with Nicky in her arms and the car keys already in hand).</p><p>“Ma’am?”</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times, pulled from the fog in her head by a staff member behind the counter, whose overly warm smile managed to both soothe and completely piss her off.</p><p>“Where’s my son?”</p><p>The moment they arrived in the emergency room, she and Rio had explained everything: the possible fever, nausea, the vomiting, and most of all, the reddish color that had paralyzed Agatha with fear and sent her straight into panic mode. A nurse had taken Nicky in for tests... Some minutes ago. Or maybe more. She honestly couldn’t tell anymore.</p><p>“He’s in good hands, ma’am.” The staff said kindly. “I just need you to sign these forms so we can proceed with the imaging tests for Nicholas.”</p><p>“I’m not signing shit unless you tell me exactly where he is!”</p><p>The staff member must’ve been used to dealing with frantic mothers, because she didn’t even blink. Her polite smile didn’t flinch.</p><p>“Look, ma’am—“</p><p>“If you call me ma’am one more time, I’ll be shoving this fucking pen so—“</p><p>“Agatha, love,” Rio cut in, breathless, having just rushed back down the hallway with two paper cups of coffee in her hands. Hot liquid dripped between her fingers, no doubt from the sprint. “Excuse us for a second.” </p><p>She set the coffees down on the counter and grabbed Agatha’s hand —using some force, because Agatha felt glued to the white hospital floor— and pulled her across the hallway.</p><p>“Agatha, please calm down. If you keep this up, they’re gonna either sedate you or kick you out.”</p><p>“Let them try!” Agatha barked. “Nicky is eight, Rio. He shouldn’t be alone with strangers. He’s probably terrified!”</p><p>“He’s fine, love—”</p><p>“You don’t know that.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “He needs to get those tests done so we know he’s okay, and the longer you delay on signing those papers, <em> politely </em>, the longer he’s gonna be stuck in there waiting.”</p><p>“I was being polite until that bitch—”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha let out a loud groan and threw her arms up in full dramatic agony before stomping back to the counter, where the staff member was still working as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p><p>Without a word, she stared the woman down for a moment, then signed the forms and turned her back to her, heading to the adjacent waiting room. Rio grabbed the coffee cups and followed behind, mumbling a quiet apology as she passed.</p><p>They were drinking the bitter excuse for coffee in silence, seated side by side, when Paul showed up alone.</p><p>“How is he?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s fantastic. Yep. So great he took my car and drove himself home. I’m just sitting here because I got tired of watching TV at my house.”</p><p>“Do you ever get tired of being sarcastic?”</p><p>“Depends. Do you ever get tired of being such an asshole?”</p><p>“OKAY.” Rio raised her eyebrows at Agatha, a clear warning to tone it down— met only with a dramatic eye roll. She turned to Paul. “He’s doing some tests. A doctor should be out soon with an update.”</p><p>Paul muttered a half-hearted thanks and sat down in the row across from them. He kept his head down, occasionally glancing up at the two women, watching Rio slowly trace her fingers across Agatha’s palm and along each of her fingers.</p><p>It wasn’t long before a doctor stepped into the room.</p><p>“Who’s Ms. Harkness?” He asked, scanning the two women.</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Oh, I could’ve sworn it was you.” He said, pointing to Rio. “You two look a lot alike. All family?”</p><p>“No, but I can draw you a family tree after you tell me how my son’s doing.” Agatha snarled.</p><p>The doctor chuckled.</p><p>“Fair enough. Very well… Nice to meet you all. I’m Dr. Strange.” He smiled, and Agatha wanted to choke him with his own stethoscope. “Nicholas is fine. We gave him an antiemetic to stop the vomiting, and we ran a full blood panel and a CRP test. The results should be ready within the hour.”</p><p>“I signed off on imaging tests.”</p><p>“Yes, you did. We’ll evaluate the bloodwork results first, and if anything comes back abnormal, we’ll proceed with the imaging right away.”</p><p>“Why not just do it now? Sounds like a waste of time to wait an hour.” </p><p>Dr. Strange still had that calm, comforting smile, just like the support staff before, and Agatha had never wanted to slap two kind people so badly in her entire life.</p><p>“It’s a stressful test for a child, to be honest. The abdominal palpation didn’t suggest anything serious, so for now we prefer to monitor him and start IV hydration. He’s allowed one visitor at a time, by the way.”</p><p>Obviously, Agatha would be the one to go in. Rio squeezed her hand, pressed a kiss to it, and told her she’d be waiting in the waiting room.</p><p>Agatha followed the doctor silently until they reached Nicky, lying on a gurney with a nurse beside him, preparing the IV line. Nicky didn’t look worried, but Agatha knew better. She knew every micro-expression on his face, and she could tell he was trying his hardest to look brave.</p><p>He called out to Agatha the moment he saw her, and she quickly hurried to his side.</p><p>“Hi, my baby.” She kissed his forehead, then both cheeks. “How are you feeling? Mommy was so worried about you.”</p><p>“I’m fine, mom. Just…” He side-eyed the nurse. “I don’t like needles.”</p><p>She gave him another round of kisses on the cheek before standing up to speak with the nurse.</p><p>“Excuse me… Hi.” She forced a polite smile. “Is there any way to do this orally instead?”</p><p>“In some cases, yes,” The nurse, who didn’t look a day over twenty, replied. “But since Nicholas had multiple episodes of vomiting before he got the antiemetic, the IV is a safer option to prevent more serious dehydration.”</p><p>It sounded reasonable enough. </p><p>Agatha looked back at Nicky, who was doing his absolute best to look brave, but his pale lips had started to tremble.</p><p>The whole process, from cleaning the injection area to inserting the catheter, felt like it took forever. After plenty of tears and protests, Nicky was finally starting to drift off on the hospital bed, while Agatha softly hummed a song and tenderly stroked the arm without the IV.</p><p>-</p><p>Nicky was fast asleep, the catheter still in his arm even though the IV bag had already emptied. The nurse had recommended leaving it in place just in case he needed another round of fluids or IV meds— sparing him the pain of another needle-stick.</p><p>Dr. Strange had come to get Agatha, and though reluctant, she told the nurse to come get her immediately if Nicky woke up.</p><p>Back in the waiting room with Rio and Paul, Dr. Strange let them know that Nicky’s test results had come back normal. However, he still showed signs of dehydration, and the doctor was hesitant to discharge him just yet. He recommended one more round of IV fluids before they could consider going home.</p><p>Agatha agreed, but not without first making it <em> very </em> clear how disturbed she was by the color of Nicky’s vomit —deep reddish-brown— and how much it resembled blood. Her concern, mixed with frustration, only grew in contrast to how calmly Dr. Strange seemed to be treating the situation. He tried, hard, to convince her it wasn’t blood, explaining that there was no real reason to believe it was beyond its appearance, which could be caused by several factors.</p><p>As soon as Dr. Strange left the room, Paul dropped into a chair with a groan.</p><p>“This day just won’t end.” He muttered, rubbing his face. He looked up at Agatha, who was still standing, eyes fixed on the door Dr. Strange had disappeared through on his way back to Nicky. “He’s okay, Agatha. The doctor literally just said that.”</p><p>Agatha ignored him.</p><p>“Hey, why don’t we go find a vending machine? We haven’t eaten since breakfast.” Rio said, placing a light hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’m not hungry.”</p><p>“Well, I am.” Rio gave her shoulder a soft squeeze. “Please?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her shoulders sagging under the weight of the day. The exhaustion was creeping in, both mentally and physically. Going from a full-blown argument at Paul’s house straight into the chaos of an emergency room with Nicky was wearing her down fast. She let Rio take her hand, and without sparing Paul a glance, she followed her down the hallway.</p><p>They found a vending machine not far from the waiting area. Rio grabbed a pack of peanut M&amp;Ms, a chocolate bar, and two bottles of water. Sensing that Agatha wasn’t exactly eager to head back and sit across from Paul, Rio led her into one of the empty hospital rooms instead.</p><p>They sat on the stiff couch next to the hospital bed, the silence heavy between them.</p><p>Rio was the first to break it.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her, which made Rio say it again.</p><p>“I’m very sorry,” She said, placing a hand over Agatha’s. “For what I did. I know I promised I wouldn’t let her get to me, and still…”</p><p>“And still you almost punched the shit out of her in front of my kid.”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together. The guilt on her face was obvious: raw and heavy. And Agatha knew. She knew Rio regretted it. She also knew, ever since the night before, that there was high risk Rio would lose her temper the moment she came face-to-face with Natasha.</p><p>Agatha and Rio sighed at the same time.</p><p>“Are you mad at me?” Rio asked, barely above a whisper.</p><p>“No.” Agatha didn’t lie. “I’m just tired. I want to go home and take Nicky with me… I just don’t know how ready I am to actually start another fight with Paul.”</p><p>“Did you mean it? What you said about going to court? About custody?”</p><p>“Yes. Well, kind of— I keep thinking about whether it would be fair to Nicky. He loves his dad, and they get along. Paul’s not a bad father, not really. I just… I can’t even be civil with him anymore. And I know that’s going to affect Nicky. That his parents can’t even be in the same room.”</p><p>“You think Paul would take <em> you </em> to court?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha sneered. “He’s not stupid enough for that.”</p><p>Rio smiled and placed the chocolates and water bottles on the floor by her feet. Then she scooted closer on the couch until she was practically in Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help?” </p><p>Her nose hovered just inches from Agatha’s jaw. Agatha wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her in, until Rio’s face was buried against her neck. Rio inhaled deeply several times.</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Agatha replied with a groan. “God, and here I was thinking motherhood would get easier after potty training and the first year of school.”</p><p>“That’s… Oddly specific.” Rio chuckled. “Why the first year of school?”</p><p>“Because Nicky was way too attached to me back then. He spent more time with me than with Paul, so every single day was a meltdown. Total nightmare.”</p><p>“Come on, it couldn’t have been every single day.”</p><p>“No, it was.” Agatha rolled her eyes and grinned, even though Rio couldn’t see her face. The memory (or trauma) was too strong. “He missed a bunch of days in the first few months. It got to the point where the school asked if I was planning to homeschool him. I lied and said I was seeing how he adjusted, but really, I just couldn’t deal with the tantrums. Thank god he’s smart, or he would’ve fallen way behind.”</p><p>Rio let out a genuine laugh, her warm breath brushing against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“So you’re saying you’d never go through that again?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked, oblivious.</p><p>“You wouldn’t have another kid?”</p><p>It took everything in Agatha not to activate her fight-or-flight mode. </p><p>Her heels even lifted slightly off the ground, ready to bolt— an instinct she masked with a casual calf stretch that almost triggered a cramp.</p><p>Dumb idea to go for that run that morning.</p><p>Agatha’s body must have tensed instinctively, because Rio lifted her head with a knowing smirk, like she knew exactly the kind of impact that question would have. </p><p>“Did I just give you an aneurysm, sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “You’re an ass.”</p><p>“I was serious, though.”</p><p>“Why? Are you planning to knock me up?”</p><p>“I don’t mind trying…”</p><p>Agatha let out another snort, shaking her head, but her brain made the very stupid decision of conjuring up a mental image far too comforting for the moment they were in: a house, bigger than her current one, that could hold space for a toddler with soft brown hair and hazel eyes eerily similar to the woman at her side. </p><p>She needed to get that image out of her head right fucking now. </p><p>When she blinked back, Rio was looking at her with so much affection that Agatha felt like her body might melt right into the cold hospital floor beneath them.</p><p>Her heart skipped, then stumbled completely out of rhythm. She couldn’t tell if it was out of panic, because the idea of starting over terrified her: the crying, the colic, the sleepless nights, the endless spit-ups and diapers, and the emotional weight of it all. </p><p>She’d sworn to herself after Nicky that she’d never do it again. </p><p>And yet… There it was. That stupid traitorous heart of hers, pounding like it didn’t quite mind the idea of holding a tiny version of Rio in her arms.</p><p>Faced with the terrible and unwelcome possibility Rio had planted in her mind, Agatha had no choice but to clear her throat —loudly, theatrically— and push herself up from the couch.</p><p>“We should get going. I don’t want Nicky to wake up alone.”</p><p>-</p><p>In the waiting room, after checking that Nicky was still asleep and only minutes away from being cleared to go home (according to the nurse’s last update), Agatha was finishing her pack of peanut M&amp;Ms while Rio scrolled through her phone, her head resting on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Agatha.” Paul called.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“It’s okay if you wanna take Nicky to your house.”</p><p>“I know. And I am taking him.”</p><p>Paul’s effort to keep his tone polite was almost tangible.</p><p>“I can pick him up next Saturday. Or Sunday.”</p><p>Agatha knew what he was really saying, or rather asking, behind the words: <em> Are we still following the same agreement? </em></p><p>“I’ll let you know.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“No! You don’t get to ‘Agatha’ me. Not after your little stunt today.”</p><p>“Stunt? You mean inviting an old friend over to meet our son?”</p><p>“She's not an old friend of yours! She <em> manipulated </em>you until you invited her because of me.”</p><p>“You think too highly of yourself.”</p><p>“Oh, do I?” Agatha scoffed. “She was after me for fucking months, Paul. Calling, texting, threatening to show up at my job. She made my life hell. Actually—” she pointed between herself and Rio. “<em> Our </em>lives hell.”</p><p>Paul actually looked surprised, but Agatha didn’t give a shit. So she kept going, “I don’t know what she’s doing back in Westview, but it can’t be good news. And you, being your usual naive little self, walked right into her trap. And well, here we are, aren’t we?”</p><p>He was silent for a moment, as he considered the accusations leveled at him. Agatha had her blue eyes narrowed so sharply on him that Paul visibly shifted in his seat. Fucking coward.</p><p>“I didn’t know that.”</p><p>“You were aware she wasn’t a good person almost a decade ago, and that didn’t stop you.”</p><p>“I apologize, alright?” He raised both hands in surrender. “I’m sorry for what happened today. Just… Please, Agatha, I don’t want to take this to court. I know the odds aren’t in my favor, and I don’t want to risk losing custody of Nicky altogether. You know I love our son. He’s the only thing I’ve got…”</p><p><em> Of you </em>.</p><p>Those were the two unsaid words tucked beneath Paul’s voice, and Agatha knew it. </p><p>She took a deep breath to keep herself from calling him pathetic.</p><p>“I’ll see how he does this week. I’ll let you know by the end of it.”</p><p>Paul nodded, and that was the end of the conversation.</p><p>Not even ten minutes later, the nurse came to call Agatha, letting her know that Nicky was starting to wake up.</p><p>Five minutes after that, she was signing the discharge papers with Nicky wrapped tightly around her waist.</p><p>A few minutes later, Paul said goodbye to Nicky. He seemed a little sad about not going to his dad’s that week, but at the same time, he barely let go of Agatha long enough to give Paul a goodbye hug.</p><p>On the way home, Rio drove while Agatha sat in the back seat with Nicky curled up against her.</p><p>Back at the house, Agatha helped Nicky shower, and now she was settling him on the couch while he scrolled through the movie options. Rio was in the kitchen, claiming to be cooking something for them to eat. Agatha didn’t even bother to ask what.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” She asked, checking his forehead for any signs of fever.</p><p>“Better, mom.”</p><p>“I want to talk to you about what happened today.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes dropped to the couch cushions.</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to hear that. And see all that. Things should’ve never gotten to that point, Nicky. If I had known... I wouldn’t have brought you there today.”</p><p>“I didn’t understand what happened. Why were you so mad, mom?”</p><p>Fuck. That one simple question, spoken in such a soft, innocent voice, nearly shattered her. Her eyes stung.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have gotten that mad. It’s just…” She forced a smile. “Old wounds, Nicky. Mommy will tell you the whole story one day. What matters now is that it was wrong, of me and your dad, to let things get to that point with you in the house.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I threw up.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t ever apologize for feeling unwell. Besides, it was on their carpet, not mine, so thank you for that.” Agatha joked, pulling a little smile out of him. “You weren’t feeling well since this morning, were you?”</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>“I woke up feeling kinda funny, but I didn’t wanna worry you.”</p><p>God, Agatha loved that kid.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pulled him into a hug. She felt his little hands resting on her back.</p><p>“You’re my son, okay? I love you more than anything in this world, and it’s my job to take care of you. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. You need to tell me when you're not feeling well… No matter the day, the time, or the place.” She pulled back slightly to kiss his forehead. “Deal?”</p><p>“Deal.” He grinned.</p><p>She covered his face with kisses until he started squirming and complaining about the excessive affection, trying to wiggle away from her. It sparked a wave of laughter between them, until she finally let him go and he settled in to watch the movie.</p><p>After the movie and dinner, Agatha tucked Nicky into bed, and now she stood in the bathroom of her bedroom suite, hands braced on the counter, the shower running behind her. She was still fully clothed, her mind spiraling through the events of the day.</p><p>Rio knocked on the bathroom door and walked in once Agatha answered.</p><p>“This is extremely not environmentally friendly.” Rio commented, noticing the water running for absolutely no reason.</p><p>“Not today, Rio.”</p><p>“Can I shower with you?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and exhaled one last time. </p><p>She shook her head slightly like she was trying to physically toss the memories out of it. She started undressing at the same time as Rio, and soon, they were both under the scalding water.</p><p>When Agatha reached for the shampoo bottle, Rio placed a hand on her arm.</p><p>“Let me.”</p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p>Rio washed her hair slowly, thoroughly, with a tenderness that bordered on reverence. Agatha closed her eyes and let her.</p><p>Agatha took longer in the bathroom than Rio did, mostly because she needed to be at least remotely presentable the next day. That meant blow-drying her hair in sections and following through with her entire skincare routine, even though her bones were practically begging her to skip it all and collapse onto the nearest soft surface.</p><p>They hadn’t actually discussed whether Rio would spend the night, especially considering it was a Sunday —holy christ, it really did feel like she’d been awake and on high alert for three straight days— and while she applied her expensive serums onto her face, Agatha strained to hear any noise coming from the bedroom.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Did Rio really just shower with her, only to put her hospital-worn clothes back on and leave?</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, spine tight and stiff. The calm, post-shower serenity from having Rio’s hands in her hair now long gone with the assumption that she wouldn’t be spending the night.</p><p>The room was empty. No pile of Rio’s clothes, no bag, no phone, no damn Rio.</p><p>Agatha sucked her lower lip into a deep pout.</p><p>Fine. She and Rio weren’t surgically attached. It was a school night. She’d see her again tomorrow morning for the meeting with Danvers.</p><p>It was totally fine if Rio decided she needed the peace and quiet of her own place after putting up with a full day of Agatha’s drama. Completely fine.</p><p>Rio could’ve <em> at least </em> texted that she was leaving— it was the bare minimum.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp sigh and picked up her phone for a distraction. Several messages from Wanda were waiting, all asking for updates on Nicky. There were a few from Paul, too. She chose to respond to Wanda first.</p><p>She was mid-text when her bedroom door swung open, making her nearly squeal from the jolt. She looked up, expecting to see Nicky.</p><p>“How many chargers do you own? Because I found at least four tangled together in your office, and none of them are for iPhones.” Rio grumbled, standing in the doorway, holding her dead phone in one hand and slowly pushing the door closed with the other. “I didn’t bring mine, and I really need to text Alice to let her know I’m alive and that you didn’t get so fed up with me that you snapped and dumped my body somewhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted at the verbal machine gun that was Rio Vidal, watching her wave the dead phone for emphasis. She was now standing beside the bed, not in her bacteria-infested hospital clothes, but in a white silk pajama set, clearly Agatha’s, taken straight from her closet. </p><p>The sight of Rio, dressed with the clothes she felt comfortable enough to take without asking her first, stirred something in her. A strange combination of unease and tenderness began building quietly in her chest.</p><p>“Agatha? The charger?” Rio asked, waving the phone in the air once more.</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times before reaching over to the drawer on her side of the bed. She pulled out a charger and handed it to her.</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio smiled. Once she plugged her phone in on her side of the bed, she sat down beside Agatha. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“Um, Paul texted. Apparently, Clare made a berry smoothie for Nicky while they were baking cookies, which explains—”</p><p>“The blood's appearance.” Rio finished.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Rio placed her hand on Agatha’s thigh, under the covers.</p><p>“Did the doctor say what happened, though? With Nicky? Was it food poisoning or something?”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Not really. He asked whether Nicky was nervous or anxious, because every time he tried to talk to Nicky about what he was doing when the nausea began, his vomiting would start all over again.”</p><p>“But he was running a bit of a fever today… You noticed it back at Paul’s.”</p><p>“I believe it was an unfortunate combination of something he ate and everything that came crashing down after.”</p><p>“Makes sense.” Rio gave Agatha’s thigh a squeeze and smiled. “At least now you don’t have to worry too much, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response and turned her attention back to her phone. </p><p>Yes, she was relieved that Nicky was okay and Rio hadn't decided to leave, but her sour mood had already settled in, and exhaustion prevented it from leaving.</p><p>When she finished replying to the most urgent messages, she set her phone down in Rio’s lap.</p><p>“You can use it if you want to text Gulliver,” Agatha said when Rio gave her a confused look. “I have her number because of the research project.”</p><p>“You’re okay with me using your phone?”</p><p>“I literally just gave it to you, didn’t I?”</p><p>Rio poked the inside of her cheek with her tongue and nodded. It took her less than two quick and impressively efficient minutes to text Alice, and then she handed the phone back to Agatha, who set it on the nightstand.</p><p>“Why are you barely looking at me, Agatha?” </p><p>“I am looking at you.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>She huffed and crossed her arms. “I thought you had left.”</p><p>“And you’re mad I didn’t?” Rio asked with a teasing smile tugging at her lips, the kind that only annoyed Agatha more.</p><p>“No, that’s not it—” Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m just exhausted from today, okay?”</p><p>Instead of answering with words, Rio swung one leg over Agatha’s lap, settling herself so the older woman was seated between her thighs. She brought both hands up to Agatha’s face, and Agatha closed her eyes, letting Rio’s fingers explore every inch of her skin with featherlight care.</p><p>Rio traced the slope of Agatha’s nose with her index finger, then moved up to her brows, circled her closed eyes, and finally dragged down to her bottom lip. Call it muscle memory or whatever, but Agatha’s lips parted slightly the moment Rio’s finger neared.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes the second she realized what she’d done, how involuntary it was. Rio was inches from her face, biting her lip and staring at Agatha like she was something ethereal.</p><p>“You’re exquisite.” Rio whispered, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha fought hard not to blurt out the three words sitting dangerously on the tip of her tongue. Words she could pretend, that maybe, were born out of exhaustion, the whirlwind of the day, the chaos, the fear, the sheer relief of not having to go through it alone. Utter gratitude for having Rio with her.</p><p>Sure, Rio had almost physically assaulted her ex, but truth be told, most people in her shoes would’ve wanted to do the same. And besides that moment, Rio had proven herself more reliable than Agatha had ever credited her to be. The way she’d taken charge getting Nicky to the car, the way she drove them to the hospital and then her house, her constant attention to both of them…</p><p>God, the tip of Agatha’s tongue literally itched. She had to press it hard against the back of her teeth just to keep it still. Rio wasn't making it easy, not with the way she was expressing affection: in her eyes, in her fingertips, in her voice. Losing the battle Agatha had waged against herself, she deflected the only way she knew how.</p><p>She crashed her lips into Rio’s.</p><p>If it were entirely up to Agatha, the kiss wouldn’t have been this soft, this tender— it would’ve been desperate and fast. But Rio kissed her like it was the first time all over again: cautiously, slowly, her tongue exploring like it was mapping a sacred territory.</p><p>Agatha had both hands on Rio’s waist when she finally pulled back.</p><p>“Nicky’s home, Rio, we can’t—”</p><p>Rio cut her off with another kiss. And Agatha, helpless, kissed her right back.</p><p>This time, it was Rio who broke away, by whispering against her mouth, “Can you be real quiet for me, love?” </p><p>Agatha let out a soft moan.</p><p>The student stood and crossed the room to lock the bedroom door. Agatha stayed where she was, back against the headboard, a finger resting between her teeth as she watched Rio move across the room.</p><p>As soon as Rio climbed back onto the bed, Agatha straightened her back and reached for her hip, intending to push Rio down onto the mattress, but Rio caught her wrist before she could.</p><p>“Why don’t you let me take care of you tonight?” </p><p>“I <em> am </em> letting you.” Agatha shot back, already defensive.</p><p>Rio just smiled, slow and knowing, and swung a leg back over Agatha’s lap, settling them into the same straddled position as before.</p><p>“Arms up,” Rio said gently, and Agatha obeyed. Rio slipped her shirt off with unhurried care, then began undressing her piece by piece.</p><p>The tenderness was welcome, sure, but Agatha was throbbing, and Rio’s exaggerated calm was not helping. She tried to switch their positions, desperate to take some kind of control, but Rio pressed her down firmly into the mattress.</p><p>“Ah-ah!” She tutted, hand splayed against Agatha’s sternum. “Patience, my love. I told you— I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but the moment Rio closed her mouth around a nipple, all words scattered.</p><p>Her lips clamped shut to stop any sound from slipping out, but it was very hard to breathe with the way Rio’s fucking skilled tongue worked in maddening circles over her nipple.</p><p>After Rio left Agatha’s entire chest flushed and glistening with saliva, she slid down the bed until she was on her stomach, propped up on her elbows, her face now dangerously close to Agatha’s cunt.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha warned, her voice barely more than a breath.</p><p>Rio smirked between her thighs.</p><p>“I’m taking my time with you tonight, Agatha,” She pressed a kiss to each of Agatha’s inner thighs. “By the time I’m done eating you out, you’re gonna feel like a fucking goddess.”</p><p>Agatha <em> shouldn’t </em> have shivered like that. She definitely shouldn’t have let out a needy, pathetic whimper at Rio’s words.</p><p>Her hand flew to Rio’s short hair— not to pull her closer, but just to act like she still had some control. And Rio, knowing Agatha like the back of her hand, let her.</p><p>Rio did, in fact, take her sweet time. Wet, open-mouthed kisses along her pussy, teasing licks against her inner lips, around her clit, inside her. </p><p>Rio fucked her with her tongue like a woman possessed, and the obscenely wet sounds —Agatha <em> was </em> dripping— were downright filthy.</p><p>Rio made her come twice just by fucking her with her tongue and circling her clit with two fingers. Agatha thrashed against the sheets, muffling her moans into the pillow pressed against her face.</p><p>Sweat dripped down her face while Rio’s glistened with her slick.</p><p>“God, I love your taste. Your body. <em> You </em>.” Rio dragged sloppy kisses along Agatha’s thighs, waiting for her to catch her breath before going in for a third round.</p><p>Which came much sooner than expected— not that Agatha could blame anyone but Rio, who seemed physically incapable of staying away from her pussy for long. When she slid two fingers inside her, Agatha nearly came undone.</p><p>“Oh <em> god </em>— Rio, yes, yes, fuck yes—”</p><p>“Fuck, you’re clenching around my fingers.” Rio murmured, curving her fingers to drag her closer to the edge. Agatha barely managed to shove the pillow back over her face.</p><p>Rio nearly lost her balance to move the pillow away from Agatha.</p><p>“I wanna see you, Agatha— watch you fall apart on my tongue.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched. She bit her lip hard enough to almost draw blood, fighting the orgasm threatening to wreck her just from her words. And Rio fucking noticed.</p><p>“You ready for a third one, my love?” Rio asked, fingers sliding in and out of Agatha’s cunt at a maddeningly slow pace, yet with enough force to make Agatha’s head knock against the headboard every time.</p><p>“Y-yes.” It was all Agatha could manage.</p><p>Rio stopped fucking her with her fingers and lowered herself fully onto the mattress. She hooked Agatha’s bent legs over her arms to pin her in place, then went to town.</p><p>Her tongue worked Agatha’s clit with near-surgical precision, making Agatha’s legs tremble.</p><p>She let go of Rio’s hair to grip the headboard instead, anchoring herself as Rio threatened to suck her soul out through her clit.</p><p>“Look at me.” Rio pulled away just enough to demand it.</p><p>Agatha dragged her gaze down, and fuck, if that sight were the last thing she ever saw, she’d die the happiest woman alive.</p><p>She needed to go to church one of these days just to thank some god for making her a lesbian.</p><p>Her other arm lay stretched beside her, fingers twisting the sheets. Rio released one of Agatha’s legs to clasp her hand instead, their fingers intertwining. </p><p>The moment Rio’s tongue flicked downward again, Agatha came with a choked scream— more like a desperate groan ripped from her throat.</p><p>Rio licked her clean with slow, unhurried strokes while Agatha lay still, trying to catch her breath and recover from the aftershocks pulsing through her body. When Rio finally kissed her way back up, she paused at Agatha’s lips, gave her a soft peck, and then slid down to lie beside her. They both shifted until they were face to face.</p><p>“You’re going to have to wait a few minutes before I can move again.” Agatha said, a lazy smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“That means I did my job right,” They were close enough that Rio just had to lean in slightly to kiss her again, which she did. “And I’m good.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow at her.</p><p>Rio let out a small sigh and dropped her gaze, suddenly shy. Her fingers traced light, thoughtful patterns along Agatha’s shoulder and down her arm. </p><p>“I was so worried about you today. It was a fucked up day, and I’m sorry if I made it worse at some point.”</p><p>“I’m not judging you for that, Rio,” Agatha said softly. “Honestly, I don’t know if I would’ve stopped you if Nicky hadn’t been there.”</p><p>“Still, it was wrong of me. I promised you—”</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay. I promise it’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha reached up and cupped her chin, guiding Rio’s face back up to eye level. They stared at each other in quiet, but it wasn’t empty silence— there was something palpable and meaningful suspended between them. A familiar itch emerged at the tip of Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>“I so appreciate you, Rio. I truly do. You were amazing with Nicky, with me, and…” God, almost a decade saying those words only to her son, and now her brain felt like it might short-circuit trying to say them to someone else. “Thank you. I mean it.”</p><p>
<em> Thank you? I mean it? </em>
</p><p>Agatha almost grimaced if not for the way Rio responded like that was exactly what she expected to hear. She smiled and kissed her, letting Agatha taste herself on her tongue.</p><p>After that spectacular lily-livered move of hers, the night didn’t stretch out much longer. Rio helped her get dressed again and unlocked the door, just in case Nicky woke up in the middle of the night looking for his mom.</p><p>For the first time, maybe ever, Rio was the one to fall asleep first. </p><p>Still facing Agatha, who had no idea how long she lay there watching her. Agatha’s fingers traced featherlight touches over Rio’s face, along her jaw, across the delicate column of her neck.</p><p>Rio only moved to get even closer to Agatha, as if even unconscious, her body knew where to look, until Rio was fully pressed against Agatha, who wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>Rio’s nose was buried in the crook of her neck, and Agatha leaned down to press a quiet kiss to the top of her head. </p><p>Certain Rio was completely out, she gave her another kiss —this one longer, firmer— and whispered, testing if she could actually say the words.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Contrary to the chaos of the weekend, the universe seemed to finally be on Agatha’s side, for once, and her week was going as smoothly as one could reasonably hope. Except, of course, for the badly timed reality that Nicky was staying with her that week, which crushed her plans to stay late on campus to wrap up a mountain of work as the end of the semester loomed closer.</p><p>As a result, she was forced to work from home— juggling her already limited free time between work deadlines, feeding her son, keeping the house in some kind of livable condition, and trying not to get annoyed by the fact that she’d barely seen Rio, just brief glimpses around campus or the rare visit to her office when Rio was able to steal a moment between her thesis work.</p><p>On top of all that, after setting the worst possible example for her child over the weekend (on how adults should not behave), how could Agatha say no when Nicky asked to skip school and tag along to work with her on a random Thursday? Also known as the busiest day of her week?</p><p>That’s how Agatha found herself in the middle of a meeting with students from her extension project, while her eight-year-old sat at the far end of the long meeting table, supposedly focused on his homework, but in reality, clearly tuning in and out of whatever his mother was saying.</p><p>“It’s unfeasible for the entire group to focus solely on disparity or adjudication in the criminal justice system,” Agatha said from the other end of the table, standing with her arms crossed, eyes scanning the group of students taking notes. “I want one team diving into real cases, and don’t limit yourselves to just New Jersey. Obviously, this isn’t a literature review, so I expect some common sense from you.”</p><p>A few students chuckled.</p><p>“Reliable and citable data, don’t forget! I want a full list of all the articles referenced, including the journal names and their impact factors. And, of course—”</p><p>“Mom?”</p><p>Not a single head in the room didn’t turn toward Nicky. Agatha scratched the tip of her nose.</p><p>“I’m working right now, Nicky. Remember what we talked about?”</p><p>“Yeah… But you also said I could ask if I needed help. Remember that?”</p><p><em> Yes, just not in the middle of a damn meeting </em>. </p><p>Agatha only thought it, of course. Outwardly, she was forced to smile politely. </p><p>Apparently, her students found it amusing that the only person who could get away with talking to her like that was a child who couldn’t even touch his feet to the floor while sitting in an office chair.</p><p>Agatha snapped her fingers to redirect the students’ attention back to her.</p><p>“Split into groups and decide who’s responsible for what.” She gave a wicked smile. “I want to know exactly who to yell at later.”</p><p>The students’ amused smiles vanished instantly, and satisfied, Agatha walked over to Nicky— who, turned out, didn’t have a homework-related question at all. He just needed help deciding what to eat at the cafeteria, where Agatha had promised to take him after the meeting.</p><p>Thank god the students were too busy to overhear their conversation.</p><p>After some gentle convincing that Nicky should stick to lighter foods for the rest of the week, Agatha returned to her spot.</p><p>“Alright. We’ll only have one more meeting before winter break, and by then I expect to see real progress. Just a reminder: I won’t be spending my break correcting papers from students I personally handpicked because I believed they were the most capable, or at least not intellectually challenged. Don’t prove me wrong.”</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands once, signaling the end of the meeting, and within minutes, the students had all left, except for Alice.</p><p>“Rio texted me and asked you to wait here. She’s just leaving the lab now.”</p><p>The mention of Rio’s name made Nicky snap his head up like a dog hearing its leash jingle.</p><p>“You know Rio?” He asked before Agatha could get a single word out.</p><p>Alice grinned. “Yeah. I actually live with her.”</p><p>His mouth fell open in surprise.</p><p>“Oh, that’s so cool! She’s really good at Mario Kart.”</p><p>“She is,” Alice laughed. “Did you know we have a steering wheel at home that you can use to play Mario Kart?” </p><p>His eyes doubled in size.</p><p>“<em> What </em>? That’s a thing? Mom!” Nicky, now visibly excited, ran over to Agatha. “Can we go play at Rio and…” He paused, suddenly realizing he didn’t know the name of the person he was talking to.</p><p>“Alice.” She said, smiling. </p><p>He nodded eagerly at Agatha.</p><p>“Um, I don’t know, Nicky…” Agatha replied, lips pressed together, resisting the urge to commit a worse misconduct than getting romantically involved with a student: murdering one for revealing the existence of that goddamn steering wheel.</p><p>“Please, please, mom!” He begged, wrapping his arms around Agatha while blinking his big brown eyes at her.</p><p>Agatha definitely didn’t want to be seen in full ‘mom mode’ in front of any student since she worried her reputation would take a hit if anyone saw her being soft with someone, even if that someone was her own kid. However, if it had to happen, better it be in front of Alice.</p><p>She sighed and placed a hand in his hair, bending down to kiss his forehead.</p><p>“If it’s okay with Alice and Rio, we can go over the weekend, okay?”</p><p>“Okay with me for what?” Rio asked as she stepped into the room. Her lips stretched into a wide grin, that small gap in her teeth on full display, the moment she saw Agatha hugging Nicky.</p><p>“Play Mario Kart with the steering wheel at your house!” Nicky was practically squealing with excitement, his skinny arms squeezing Agatha tight.</p><p>Rio chuckled, stepping closer to them. Still wary of Nicky’s jealousy when it came to Agatha, she kissed Agatha on the cheek and ruffled Nicky’s hair. </p><p>Alice watched the whole interaction with a cheesy smile, and Agatha refused to look at her.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, you guys should totally come. We can even do a tournament! Whoever wins gets to choose what we have for dinner.”</p><p>Agatha was so close to killing two students at that moment.</p><p>Fortunately for both of them, the urge passed when Alice offered to walk Nicky down to the cafeteria. Agatha chose not to ask what kind of text Rio had sent to convince Alice to babysit a child for the next fifteen minutes, and the thought definitely vanished the second Rio’s tongue was in her mouth.</p><p>“God, I missed you so much.” Rio whispered between kisses, sliding her hands under Agatha’s blazer to grip her waist, pressing her against the wall. “Can’t you drop Nicky off at Maximoff’s tonight? And come over to my place?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands rested on either side of Rio’s neck, her thumbs gently stroking her cheek.</p><p>“Vision’s parents are with them this week.” Agatha replied, then bit down on Rio’s lower lip, pulling her into another kiss, this one all tongue and teeth. For a moment, the only sound in the meeting room was the filthy slick of tongues and low moans muffled by each other’s mouths.</p><p>Agatha was the one to pull away first, smirking when she saw the state of Rio’s lips: red and swollen, and she brushed her lips over them again and let out a soft laugh when, upon opening her eyes again, she found Rio still there with parted lips, clearly waiting for more.</p><p>“Seriously though, are you going to be able to finish everything you need before we leave for Salem? You still haven’t turned in your final paper for my class.”</p><p>Rio groaned.</p><p>“Agatha, I really don’t want to talk about that right now.” She squeezed her waist tighter and slid her hand down to her ass. “I <em> really </em> miss you.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head and nibbled on her earlobe, earning a visible shiver from Rio.</p><p>“As much as I love when you're this horny and desperate for me…” She traced her tongue lightly along Rio’s pulse point, then pulled back just enough to be eye-level with her. “I really need you to be on top of your shit these next few weeks.”</p><p>“I promise I am,” Rio confirmed, nodding her head. “But I won’t lie… I’m not looking forward to the weekend with that blonde bitch.”</p><p>“At least she stopped offering me her house to stay.”</p><p>“Well, yeah! Only ‘cause now she knows we’re together.”</p><p>“And she was totally normal about it.”</p><p>Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Anyway… How about a quickie?”</p><p>-</p><p>Agatha should have taken the quickie offer when she had the chance —screw workplace rules and career risks— because the rest of the week didn’t allow her a single break. She didn’t even see Rio again after that encounter.</p><p>Saturday came in rainy and with a drop in temperature that only served to sour Agatha’s mood even more. She had spent the whole week sticking to a morning running routine, which had proven absolutely necessary to burn off and redirect the… For lack of better words, the pent-up horniness she’d been carrying— a direct consequence of Rio’s absence.</p><p>Since she refused to run in that kind of cold and rain, Agatha decided to spend her morning taking an extra-long shower, one that would no doubt earn her a lecture from Rio about unconscious water usage and how water waste was a far bigger problem than most people realized.</p><p>Yes, Agatha had heard that lecture before. Well… Almost all of it.</p><p>She laughed to herself at the memory: Agatha, fresh out of the shower and fully naked, while Rio stood in the bathroom explaining all the ramifications of excessive water consumption. Or rather, trying to explain while fighting for her life because Agatha was drying herself in slow motion, deliberately running the towel at 0.5x speed under her breasts, along her neck, and down her thighs.</p><p>Rio never managed to finish her point.</p><p>Once she was dressed, hair dry and with light makeup, Agatha made breakfast for Nicky, whose very first words of the day were “Mario Kart”, and apparently that was the only thing he could focus on that day.</p><p>It was a long morning, to say the least, with Nicky asking Agatha every ten minutes to call Rio and check if they could go to her apartment to play with that damn steering wheel yet.</p><p>When they finally arrived at Rio and Alice’s apartment, she had to grab Nicky by the shoulder to keep him from launching himself onto the two Nintendo wheels the students had set up in the middle of the living room.</p><p>In the next few hours, Agatha managed to dodge every attempt from anyone who challenged her to a Mario Kart race. She was forty-six years old, goddammit, an age far too old for there to be any excuse when she inevitably sent that steering wheel flying out the nearest window because her eight-year-old son wouldn’t stop hitting her with troll items.</p><p>While Nicky, Rio, and Alice laughed their heads off competing against each other, Agatha alternated between the corner of the couch, the kitchen stool, or Rio’s bedroom, where she eventually chose to make a call. </p><p>Not before taking three deep breaths and asking for divine patience from a god she didn’t believe in.</p><p><em> “Hey, Agatha.” </em> Paul’s voice came through. <em> “Is Nicky okay?” </em></p><p>“He’s better, yes.”</p><p>An awkward silence followed until Paul cleared his throat.</p><p>
<em> “I bought the game he wanted.” </em>
</p><p>“And?”</p><p>
<em> “And I wanted to give it to him. Today. When I pick him up from your place.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the audacity of that motherfucker.</p><p>“I never agreed to that plan, Paul. But since you brought it up…” She took a deep breath, rubbing her temples as she settled into the armchair in Rio’s bedroom. “I gave some thought to this whole situation, and I think we can keep a similar arrangement for the rest of the year.”</p><p><em> “That’s really great to hear, Agatha, and—” </em> He paused for a moment. <em> “For the year? What do you mean?” </em></p><p>“That’s enough time for us, or in this case, for me, to adjust my work schedule. Starting next year, Nicky will be staying with me for two weeks straight. And if <em> he </em> wants to, because it’s entirely his choice, he can spend up to a week with you. Or a couple of weekends if he prefers.”</p><p>
<em> “That’s not fucking fair, Agatha.” </em>
</p><p>“You should consider yourself lucky I’m not taking away all your parental rights, Paul. Do you have any idea how fucking lucky you are?”</p><p>
<em> “Lucky that you’re giving me the great privilege of seeing my son once a month?” </em>
</p><p>“It could be more. If Nicky wants.”</p><p>
<em> “You’re unbelievable, holy fucking—” </em>
</p><p>“Thanks,” She muttered. “Look, if you want to pick him up today, that’s fine by me. But I’ll be picking him up from school on Monday. I’ll be out of town next weekend, and I’ve already made arrangements to leave him with Wanda and Vision.”</p><p><em> “Are you for real right now? You’re traveling and instead of leaving him with me, his dad, you’re leaving him at someone else’s house? Agatha, you’re getting on my fucking nerves.” </em> Paul was close to shouting. <em> “You already preferred to keep him home with you on Thanksgiving instead of letting him have a traditional holiday at my house, and now this?” </em></p><p>Well, it was true. Agatha couldn’t give a rat’s ass about Thanksgiving. That year, the holiday had been perfectly spent under the blankets with Nicky, watching whatever silly movie he wanted. And as far as she could tell, Nicky had been more than happy with that, without all the nonsense that came with Paul’s family.</p><p>“If you start yelling on the phone, I’m hanging up, blocking your number, and you’ll need a fucking judge before I let you get anywhere near him.” Agatha snarled, then took another deep breath. “Do you want to settle this in court, Paul?” She practically purred in a fake sweet voice. “I’ve made the arrangements, whether you like it or not, so just tell me if you’re picking him up today.”</p><p>
<em> “Fuck you— I’m leaving in ten.” </em>
</p><p>“We’re at Rio’s right now. He’s having a great time, so meet us at my front door in two hours. I’ll text you.” She stood up from the armchair. “And Paul? If you say one word to Nicky, anything at all, to influence him in any way, I’ll know, and the outcome won’t be pretty for you.”</p><p>She hung up before Paul could reply and stepped out of the bedroom with an expression gloomy enough to make Rio raise her eyebrows at her. Agatha just waved for her to keep playing and moved back to the couch beside Nicky to watch the match.</p><p>After Rio purposely lost several rounds in a row, first place came down to Nicky and Alice. Gladly, he was so absorbed in trying to beat Alice that Agatha finally had a moment alone with Rio.</p><p>“Agatha, god—” Rio managed to whisper, in her bedroom, when Agatha sucked on the skin just below her pulse point, harder than the moment called for.</p><p>“Why don’t you sleep over tonight, baby? Nicky’s sleeping at his dad’s.” Agatha said, kissing along Rio’s jaw while the student tangled her fingers messily in her hair.</p><p>“I can’t, I promised Alice and Will we’d get together tonight to finish the paper for your class.” Rio answered, tugging on Agatha’s hair to pull the older woman back to her neck, something Agatha gladly obliged. “Wait, you’re letting him stay at Paul’s?”</p><p>“Yes and no. I’ll explain later.” Agatha murmured before sucking at Rio’s neck near her collarbone until Rio hissed under her breath. “And fuck, you really picked today to do this?”</p><p>“They can’t tomorrow, love. Gotta be tonight.”</p><p>Agatha groaned in frustration, until she remembered that if there was anyone who could make Rio’s life easier (or her own, if she could convince Rio to sleep over at her place), it was her, Professor Harkness.</p><p>“I’ll help you.”</p><p>“Wait, really? You said—”</p><p>“I know what I said,” Agatha kissed her lips. “Just come over.”</p><p>Rio happily agreed. Agatha’s tongue had barely slipped into her mouth again when Nicky started calling (shouting, really) for her from the living room.</p><p>-</p><p>Back at her house, Nicky had already gone with Paul— after much resistance on the kid’s part, since he didn’t get to choose dinner as he’d agreed with Rio, even after winning the game (something Alice allowed only after numerous not-so-subtle pinches from Rio).</p><p>Agatha was changing into a white sweatsuit, her hair pulled back in a low ponytail, when she heard her front door open. She made a mental note to start locking her house.</p><p>Something painfully obvious for someone with a PhD in Juridical Science with focus on Criminology, but whatever.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio called from downstairs.</p><p>“I’m changing.” Agatha replied, part of her expecting Rio to come find her in the bedroom. However, after she was fully dressed and enough time had passed for her to lose hope that Rio was as horny as she was, Agatha headed downstairs with a pout.</p><p>What she found was her dining table turned into a complete pandemonium of Rio’s materials scattered over every inch of surface. Laptop, iPad, printed pages, scribbled and blank ones— Rio could probably open her own stationery store if she wanted to.</p><p>“Jesus fuck, Rio, what the hell is this mess?”</p><p>Rio was sitting at the head of the table and lifted her head toward her.</p><p>“I told you I had stuff to do today, love.”</p><p>“Yes, for my course, not for all your classes.” Agatha complained, walking straight to the kitchen with a humph. </p><p>Rio followed her.</p><p>“I forgot I have to turn in a few things for Professor Kale, and I want to submit them before our trip to Salem. I don’t want to risk missing the deadline.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio poked her cheek with her tongue, watching Agatha move around the kitchen, tidying up the mess of milk and cereal Nicky had left behind.</p><p>“Agatha, sweetheart, I need you in a good mood in case I gotta ask for your help. You know? That help you said you’d give me if I needed it? For the final paper for your class?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. </p><p>“I said I would do it, Rio.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes slightly, evidently suspicious whether Agatha was in a good enough mood to help rather than just scolding and cursing. She gave up on asking again and approached the older woman like she was about to pet a wild animal.</p><p>“What if I make us some sandwiches before I start, huh?” Rio offered, her hands brushing lightly over Agatha’s waist as she smirked. “Your bitchy mood sounds a lot like hunger to me.”</p><p>Agatha was starving, alright, just not for food. God, she had to be ovulating or something, considering her constant urge to jump Rio’s bones at the first opportunity— which, apparently, wasn’t coming any time soon. Neither was she, so it seemed. </p><p>Her body melted into Rio’s embrace before she could even make a conscious decision.</p><p>“How much do you have left to finish your paper? I assume you’ve at least done the reading and written a draft… Right?”</p><p>Rio bit her lower lip, and Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes at the heavens (well, at her kitchen ceiling).</p><p>“I finished the reading, yeah, but the draft…” Rio tilted Agatha’s chin up so their eyes met. “I promise I can handle it, love, and I know you’ve got a ton on your plate too, so why don’t you bring your stuff to the table while I make us something to eat?”</p><p>Rio was lucky she was fucking gorgeous, and that those brown eyes of hers seemed to communicate directly with Agatha’s neurochemicals, making her melt on the spot.</p><p>Hours later, with plates full of crumbs scattered across the table and empty mugs of tea and coffee, Agatha had migrated with her laptop to the couch, which was a terrible idea. Earlier, the urge to sleep had come in small, manageable waves that black tea could fend off. But now, it hit like a tsunami, pulling her under until she finally dozed off.</p><p>She woke up to a high-pitched laugh that nearly made her drop her laptop on the hardwood floor. Agatha sat up, still groggy, and glanced at her wrist watch. 11:48 pm. Jesus christ. </p><p>Placing the laptop on the coffee table, she padded toward the dining room. Rio was exactly where she’d left her: hunched over her laptop, presentation slides pulled up on her iPad, and a google document filling her main screen.</p><p>Still half-asleep, Agatha tugged the elastic from her ponytail, letting her hair fall in uneven waves over her shoulders and back. She leaned down, draping her arms around Rio’s shoulders, pressing a kiss to her cheek before trailing her lips down the side of her neck.</p><p>“How are you doing over there, baby?”</p><p>Rio jumped at Agatha’s sudden presence, but that didn’t explain why she was staring at her laptop like she’d just been caught watching porn and was in an urgent need to close the incriminating tabs.</p><p>“Uh, Agatha, I—” Rio cleared her throat, fingers fumbling as she clicked to another tab.</p><p>Agatha’s smile dimmed the second her eyes landed on the screen. A Zoom window. Alice. William. Eddie. And in the largest square, both of them, with Rio laughing nervously while Agatha’s face disappeared from her neck and out of frame.</p><p>“Dammit, Rio!” Agatha hissed, circling around the chair so the camera couldn’t catch her.</p><p>Rio continued to chuckle, her shoulders shaking. </p><p>Despite the headphones, Agatha could hear the muffled giggles of her students coming through.</p><p>“Guys, guys, hang on, I’ll mute for a second.” Rio said between laughs, fingers fumbling on the trackpad. “I’m sorry, love, I thought you were still sleeping— fuck, your face was priceless.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“A video call in my house, Rio? What the <em> fuck </em>? I could’ve been in pajamas. Or no clothes at all!”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry— I really thought you were dead asleep on the couch. You were even snoring, you know? It was cute.”</p><p>“I don’t snore.”</p><p>“But you did.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m exhausted and I want to go to bed. Do you still need me?”</p><p>Rio stood, lips curving into a dangerous smirk as she looped both arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Oh, definitely.”</p><p>“So turn that thing off and let’s go to bed.” Agatha was dangerously close to begging at that point.</p><p>Rio kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>“Give me thirty minutes?” Agatha huffed instead of answering, and Rio grinned. “Look, my love, we’re taking forever because The Witch lived up to her name and is asking for an absurdly long paper, and since I promised I wouldn’t take advantage of dating my professor…” She lifted her brows.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again, which prompted Rio to say, “Will you stop that? I only like when you roll your eyes at me in a very different context.”</p><p>“And what context would that be? ’Cause right now it looks like you’re trying to make me wait until marriage.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved upward and Agatha regretted the comment instantly, but Rio was always too fast with her comebacks for Agatha to pivot.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha…” Rio pecked her lips. “Don’t put ideas in my head if you’re too scared I’ll actually follow through.”</p><p>“Fuck you.” Agatha’s hand, resting on her waist, slid lower until she fully cupped Rio’s front, making her startle and let out an involuntary moan. “I’ll be upstairs.”</p><p>She pulled away, and before she made it halfway up the stairs, Rio’s exasperated voice echoed after her, “What a fucking delight, being this wet and stuck writing a paper— both completely your fault!”</p><p>Needless to say, despite Agatha’s best efforts, she was out cold mere minutes after her head hit the pillow. No matter how much Rio, smelling of soap, tried to wake her by scattering kisses along her neck, shoulders, and collarbone. The exhaustion, stress, and self-imposed pressure of the last few weeks made it impossible for Agatha to do anything but pull Rio closer and let sleep take her again, wrapped in the younger woman’s scent.</p><p>-</p><p>The week leading up to Agatha and Rio landing at Boston Logan International Airport was frantic and stressful for both of them.</p><p>Agatha, now in her full-time position as a mom, had already forgotten how to recover her patience at the speed an eight-year-old demanded. On top of that was the constant worry and ever-present sense of obligation— <em> always </em> needing to put Nicky’s needs before her own. She truly envied women whose sense of motherhood came naturally, and not only with the help of too many glasses of wine late at night while on the phone with Wanda, who happened to be one of those women.</p><p>Thank god for Wanda, who calmed her down through countless calls and handed out tips on how to keep a child entertained. Because, as the days passed and they settled into a new routine where Nicky was always around, there were apparently only two realistic outcomes: either Nicky would become an insufferable kid who couldn’t function away from a screen, or Agatha’s house was going to need an intervention with the number of toys, drawings, and balls scattered across every single room. Including her office, where she stepped barefoot on a Lego piece and swore so much in so little time it would’ve made a sailor shrink in horror. If she threw the Lego out the window, it was only because the piece absolutely deserved its fate.</p><p>Despite the times Agatha sacrificed her short breaks to go see Rio at the lab, the small number of visits combined with their limited time together were another factor dragging both of them into terrible moods. Even though Nicky accepted —and even asked for— Rio’s presence, the student was spending more hours at the university to keep up with everything, just as she had promised Agatha she would, than at her own place… Or at Agatha’s, for that matter.</p><p>The drive from Boston Logan International Airport to Salem was, unfortunately, filled with far too much social interaction, since Danvers had volunteered to give them a ride and seemed determined to update Agatha on every single thing happening at the academic event that week at the university. Rio, meanwhile, left on her own in the back seat and often ignored by Carol, fell asleep not even five minutes after they left the parking lot.</p><p>The hotel check-in was, truly, a fucking surprise. When Carol had briefly mentioned that Agatha’s lecture would take place on the last day of a week-long academic event focused on all the environmental courses at Salem University —which was already a lot— she had definitely left out the scale of the event.</p><p>So, yeah, it was a huge surprise for both Agatha and Rio when the hotel lobby turned out to be decked out with banners, information desks, name tags, and glossy posters of the speakers (including her), not to mention very important people (judging by the raised chins, business attire, and behavior far too posed for a hotel) scattered around the lobby and the bar.</p><p>After check-in, key card in hand, both women went to their respective rooms on different floors.</p><p>Someone knocked on Agatha’s door not even fifteen minutes after she’d stepped inside.</p><p>“Can we take a nap?” Rio asked, slipping into Agatha’s room.</p><p>“You literally slept for almost an hour on the way here.”</p><p>Rio was sprawled across the middle of the bed, face-down like a starfish, her voice muffled by the pillows.</p><p>“And I could sleep three more. Wanna bet?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. </p><p>“No, and I told Danvers I’d meet her in the lobby in less than an hour to meet some of tomorrow’s speakers.”</p><p>“Do you want me to go with you?” Rio asked, rolling onto her side and propping herself up on her arm.</p><p>“Only if you want to take advantage of the networking opportunity. Could be good for you.”</p><p>“Not feeling like it today,” Rio shrugged, raising a brow. “Unless she spends the whole time on top of you…”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp laugh, already moving closer to the student.</p><p>“Not even you top me, darling.” Agatha joked, pinching Rio’s cheek hard enough to leave a pink mark before pulling her hand back just in time to avoid a playful slap.</p><p>“Are you sure? Because I have some very vivid memories of topping you back at my place…”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“How much time do you have? I could show you exactly how I turned you into a needy mess under me…”</p><p>Agatha tossed her long hair over her shoulder with theatrical flair and refused to dignify Rio with a reply, heading into the bathroom to freshen up instead.</p><p>She got ready in record time, opting for a monochrome outfit: a white off-the-shoulder blouse with voluminous sleeves tucked into sleek high-waisted black pants. A wide black belt cinched her waist, and she slipped into classic pointed-toe black heels. She was working a product through her hair, letting it fall loose and wild over her bare shoulders, when Rio appeared in the bathroom.</p><p>“Damn, you look hot.” Rio murmured, placing her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and caressing them, standing just behind her. </p><p>Agatha lifted her chin to catch the student’s reflection in the mirror.</p><p>“Thanks, baby,” She smiled, fixing her earrings. “Should I call room service so you’ll have something to eat after your millionth nap of the day?”</p><p>“Actually, I was thinking…” Rio brushed Agatha’s hair aside and pressed her lips to the back of her neck, sending shivers down her skin. “What if I meet you later in the lobby? And we can go out for dinner?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha checked her belt and tugged at her blouse to make sure it wasn’t indecently low for an academic event, then turned to face Rio, who still had her hands stroking her arms. “Just, um, let’s not make our relationship too obvious… I know it doesn’t really matter here, but I want as little stress as possible. It’s only today and tomorrow, and then we’re gone. I don’t want to hear the same comments all over again—”</p><p>Rio squeezed her shoulders.</p><p>“Love, I get it, okay?” She kissed her. “Though it’s really not fair for you to wear that and then ask me not to drool over you in public.”</p><p>“You’re not even going to be with me in public tonight, Rio. Not here, at least.” Agatha laughed.</p><p>“I haven’t decided that yet!”</p><p>“Are you really so jealous of Danvers you’re willing to go to the lobby and socialize with god knows how many PhDs?”</p><p>“Very possible, yes.”</p><p>-</p><p>Hours later —or maybe just forty-five minutes— Agatha was holding a glass of white wine while walking alongside Danvers, weaving through different groups of professionals as the blonde made introductions. Agatha had already said the topic of her lecture at least ten times. Not that she was keeping count, of course.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness, is this your first time in Salem?” Asked one of the event sponsors, some MIT hotshot who now ran a startup in engineering and artificial intelligence, and had presented himself as Tony Stark just moments earlier.</p><p>Agatha smiled politely.</p><p>“It is, yes.”</p><p>“Oh, then you <em> have </em> to do the history and hauntings of Salem tour,” He said with a smile that Agatha assumed was his attempt at being charming. “There’s a guided tour, but I’ve been so many times I could be your personal guide. Tomorrow, after your lecture?”</p><p>Did she look like a straight woman hunting for a wealthy average-height man in a hotel lobby?</p><p>She frowned slightly and downed the rest of her wine in one go, buying herself a moment to answer. After all, she knew exactly how much pull Stark had, and she wouldn’t exactly mind if one of her research projects got funded with his endless money.</p><p>“We actually have a reception tomorrow after the event.”</p><p>“Right, right… Well, I know a bar that’s so thematic it’s basically the same experience. Honestly, even better, especially after a couple of good old bourbons.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, about to respond, when she felt the ghost of a hand brush over her arm, the one resting casually at her side. Her skin recognized those fingers right away— so many times she has felt them on her body. Or inside it.</p><p>“Another glass of wine, Dr. Harkness?” Rio asked, tilting her head toward the empty glass in Agatha’s hand. She turned to Stark. “Nice to meet you. Rio Vidal.” She extended her hand toward him.</p><p>He intensified (or tried to) the charm in his smile as he shook her hand.</p><p>“Tony Stark.” </p><p>Rio didn’t even bother pretending to care, while Agatha answered her with just a nod, and then Rio headed off toward the bar. Gone were the jeans and hoodie, Rio was now in a casual yet sophisticated look: a gray plaid suit with a relaxed-fit blazer, a white cropped top underneath, and cropped wide-leg pants that hugged just right.</p><p>It took Agatha a few seconds, of course, to realize how blatantly she was staring, lip caught between her teeth as Rio walked away. She ran her tongue across her teeth, suddenly very horny, before forcing herself to turn back to Stark… Only to catch him wearing the same expression she had, also watching Rio.</p><p>How fucking dare he?</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>“She part of the Westview faculty too? Wow, I’ve clearly been wasting time not paying your adorable campus a visit.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, digging her fingers into her bicep just to fight the urge to roll her eyes.</p><p>“No. Master’s student and my assistant for the course I’ll be presenting a lecture about tomorrow.”</p><p>“Assistant, you said?” He asked, and Agatha nodded. “I’ve been attending Salem University’s academic events for half a decade now, and I’ve yet to see an assistant like… Videl?”</p><p>“Vidal.” Agatha corrected, forcing a smile just in time, since Rio was walking back with two glasses of wine in hand. “The assistants at Westview are very high calibre, I assure you. In fact, on some of my other projects I’ve got another assistant just as good.”</p><p>He didn’t need to know that said assistant was basically a nervous, chatty twink who lived in mortal fear of her. Leaving that part out definitely piqued Stark’s curiosity.</p><p>“Is that so?” He raised a brow, clearly intrigued, exactly the opening Agatha needed to start bringing up her projects, which just so happened to be in need of resources. Well, not really in need— her research was among the most prestigious and well-funded in the university. But if Agatha was anything, it was ambitious.</p><p>Agatha offered her most dazzling smile, which earned a confused look from Rio as she handed over the glass of wine. Contrary to what both Stark and Agatha had assumed, the second glass wasn’t for him. It was for herself. Rio took a sip, smirk tugging at her lips.</p><p>He was even more enchanted.</p><p>Men… Fucking idiots.</p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha turned back to Stark. “Dr. Danvers mentioned your interest in applying artificial intelligence outside the usual STEM fields?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah— competition’s getting ridiculous. Suddenly every engineer wants to use AI for the most basic crap. It’s like logical reasoning got left behind in high school.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t actually find that funny, but she laughed anyway, ignoring Rio’s surprised look at how engaged she seemed in the conversation. “Couldn’t agree more.” She lied smoothly, a smile on her lips. “Did Dr. Danvers happen to mention a research project I’m developing for next year? I think it lines up pretty well with your interests, Stark.”</p><p>“What research?” Rio cut in, brows nearly touching.</p><p>“Really?” Stark said, impressed, right on top of Rio’s question.</p><p>Agatha chose to answer him first, her blue eyes fixed on Stark. “Why don’t we grab a seat at the bar in, say, ten minutes? I can tell you all about it.”</p><p>Naturally, he agreed a little too eagerly, and when he put a hand on Agatha’s shoulder before heading off to the bar, she decided not to comment on it. </p><p>Of course, Rio wasn’t about to let it slide.</p><p>“What the actual fuck was that?”</p><p>“Me trying to land astronomical funding for my next research project.” Agatha replied like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>“A research project you haven’t told me a single thing about?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, glancing around to make sure no one was eavesdropping.</p><p>“It’s something new I’ve been working on these past few weeks.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve helped—”</p><p>“Rio, it has nothing to do with your field. Besides, I didn’t even want to be at this godforsaken event, but since I’m here, I might as well take advantage of the opportunity. Hopefully, landing funding of that scale could make the university board forget I’m in a relationship with a student.” Tenure was all that mattered in her career, after all.</p><p>“And if it takes flirting with some asshole dude to get that, you’re all in? Is that what you’re saying?”</p><p>“Please. I’m not flirting with anyone. You’re just used to me being blunt and harsh back in Westview.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, and it couldn’t have been clearer how badly she was holding herself back from touching Agatha, especially after seeing Stark’s hand on her bare shoulder.</p><p>“So what am I supposed to do while you wait for him to sign the check?”</p><p>“That’s not how it works.” Agatha chuckled. “Network? Go back to the room and channel surf? Do whatever, Rio. I really need to get going.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Go ahead”</p><p>-</p><p>Two glasses of wine later, and the conversation had gotten way more technical than Agatha expected —Stark grew surprisingly serious when it came to his money— but she had practically secured the funding. If she had to pull her shoulder away from his hand or fake a chat with a complete stranger whenever he leaned in to whisper something in her ear… Well, it was a small price to pay if the outcome was her getting tenure. She was so close she could taste it. </p><p>So, no, she did not mind that a rich asshole was trying to get into her pants when she was already savoring the moment Lilia would ask for a meeting with her just to tell the news.</p><p>Stark didn’t strike her as the type to back out of a deal, verbal or not, just because she dodged all his advances and left him to find some other warm body. Still, Agatha would never make the mistake of underestimating a man’s ability to be petty, which meant she kept creating obstacles to avoid being alone with him, casually stepping aside whenever she sensed his hand about to land somewhere on her body. Nothing too blatant, of course. To everyone else’s eyes, they probably just looked like colleagues socializing with other brilliant minds.</p><p>Agatha was sipping from her glass of wine, standing with Tony, Danvers, and two other people whose names she hadn’t bothered remembering, when a familiar face made a beeline straight for her.</p><p>She downed the rest of her glass in one aggressive gulp just as Jennifer Kale threw her arms open to… Hug her. Actually hug her.</p><p>“Harkness! I was looking for you!” Jen said, already wrapping her arms around Agatha. The gesture was so wildly out of character, so absurdly abnormal, that Agatha stiffened on instinct at the contact, but she managed to recover quickly enough not to make the moment even more awkward.</p><p>“Oh, hey, Kale…” Agatha managed to say, still caught completely off guard by Kale’s sudden appearance in fucking Salem.</p><p>“Excuse me, folks, I’m gonna steal Harkness for a bit! We’ll be right back!”</p><p>For reasons unknown, Agatha was taken away to a quieter spot, distant from the group that kept rambling about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency and the lack of regulation surrounding it. Honestly, she could thank Jen for pulling her out of there.</p><p>Of course, she wouldn’t.</p><p>“What are you even doing here, Kale?” Agatha asked the moment Jen stopped in front of her. “God, Bloody Mary’s got nothing on you, because I swear I haven’t said your name more than once.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Carol invited me— though she didn’t say it outright, I know it’s just to make sure you don’t terrify students and professors with that delightful personality of yours.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you.”</p><p>“See? Case in point.” </p><p>“You dragged me out here just to be a pain in my ass? Couldn’t you have waited until we ran into each other back on campus in Westview?”</p><p>“I dragged you out here to ask what the hell is going on between you and Stark? I can’t tell who’s up whose ass—”</p><p>“Oh, that? That, my dear, is just me making sure my next project gets funded by Stark Industries. How jealous are you right now?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened, and she grabbed Agatha’s arms in shock.</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?! Damn, Agatha, you do not waste any time. What, two hours here and you already managed to reel in the richest investor in the room?”</p><p>Agatha tossed her hair back theatrically, flashing a toothy grin.</p><p>“Yep. You know, it’s not just about good looks—” She was ready to give Jen a hard time, but Jen cut her off by pulling her into yet another hug. What the hell was she drinking tonight, to hug Agatha twice in one evening? Considering they’d known each other for almost a decade, and up until today, the total hug count was exactly… Two.</p><p>“I’m happy for you, really. I mean… I know we don't always agree, but you bring tremendous recognition to the university. And I knew tenure was basically guaranteed, but after your relationship with Vidal came out, things got… Messy. If it was up to me, though, there’s no doubt tenure is the logical decision.”</p><p>Agatha was absolutely stunned into silence. She opened and closed her mouth like a fish a few times, half-expecting Jen to follow up with a jab, or ‘accidentally’ spill a drink on her, or something to prove this was all just Kale messing with her.</p><p>Apparently not, because Jen’s dark eyes were looking at her with genuine seriousness and empathy.</p><p>“Thank you, Kale,” Agatha smiled— not ironically, not a smirk, but a real smile. “I wasn’t expecting this trip to be more work than it already is, but earlier today I mentioned to Rio the opportunity for networking, and then something just clicked for me.” She took a deep breath. “Anyway, I’m hoping that getting another research project off the ground, this time with the financial backing of a company this big, will guarantee me tenure. I have nothing else left to offer them.”</p><p>“That’s more than enough, I assure you.” Jen smiled, and Agatha returned it. </p><p>The silence that followed quickly started to feel awkward, because, after all, they weren’t friends. </p><p>Jen cleared her throat and tilted her head toward the other end of the room.</p><p>“One more thing… Maybe you should tell Rio to stop the staring?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“She’s either staring at you like she wants to rip your clothes off right here and now— which, frankly, gross, or she’s staring like she wants to murder anyone who comes near you.”</p><p>“You cannot possibly—”</p><p>“No, I’m dead serious. More than one person has asked me who, and I quote, <em> the young woman with the murderous look on her face </em> is… And whether we need to call security.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, shaking her head.</p><p>“Fuck off, you’re messing with me.”</p><p>“I’m really, really not. You’d better go deal with your girlfriend before someone actually calls security.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but took the warning seriously, and within seconds she was locking eyes with Rio, subtly pointing toward the hallway that led to the elevators and emergency stairs.</p><p>Rio did not look happy. Murderous look was honestly a polite way of describing the expression on the student’s face. Arms crossed, she cut across the space— if not for the noise of dozens of conversations, the sound of her heels on the floor would’ve echoed loudly.</p><p>Once they were alone, Agatha raised her brows, silently demanding an explanation.</p><p>“<em> What </em>?”</p><p>Clearly, Rio wasn’t interested in offering one.<br/>
Agatha sighed. </p><p>“Why are you even here?” The professor asked, wanting to know why Rio hadn’t gone back to her room —or Agatha’s room, for that matter— if she clearly wasn’t in the mood to socialize.</p><p>“You want me gone so you can keep being all smiley and touchy? Is that it?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“You think I haven’t been watching you, Agatha? This whole time? It was fine when you didn’t want people to know we’re together, but you acting… Like that? And letting people, <em> men </em>, think they’ve got a shot with you? No. Hell no.” Rio said while shaking her head a few times.</p><p>“As much as people love to call me a witch, you do know I’m not actually one, right? I can’t control what people imagine.”</p><p>“Don’t do this— don’t make it sound like I’m some jealous weirdo when you know exactly what you’re doing in there.”</p><p>“What I was doing in there was making sure my research gets off the ground. I was making sure I have a real chance at tenure. You know, the thing I’ve been working on for almost a decade, something that almost went down the drain the second I admitted I was in a relationship with you?” Agatha’s breath was sharp and unsteady, bracing for the fight she knew was about to erupt. By an emergency stairwell. In a hotel. In fucking Massachusetts. “<em> That’s </em> what I was doing.”</p><p>Rio still had her arms crossed, tightening them even harder around her body.</p><p>“Don’t you dare make me feel guilty for being with you.”</p><p>“God, Rio, that’s not what I’m doing—”</p><p>“I thought I’d be fine keeping us a secret here, but honestly? I’m not. I want every prick out there to know we’re together.”</p><p>“We literally talked about this just a few hours ago—”</p><p>“I don’t give a damn! I’m not comfortable watching that asshole act the way he does around you, and he does it because he thinks he’s got a chance. It’s the exact same thing Danvers used to do, and did, for so long, because you refused to tell everyone about us. And you still don’t want to!” Rio threw her hands up, putting distance between them. “I did everything I could to help with your son, I’ve stood by you every single time you needed me, even when you were too damn proud to ask. And yet, you treat me like a dirty secret.”</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Agatha wasn’t ready to admit it —call it pride or whatever— but Rio had a point. A sharp one, if she was being honest. </p><p>Agatha bit down on her lower lip, forcing her slightly alcohol-fogged brain to think, and to choose her words carefully. But Rio spoke again before she could say a thing.</p><p>“I wonder how long you would’ve kept me a secret if we had never gone to that festival. I truly wonder.”</p><p>“That’s not fair. You know you’re not a dirty secret, and I fucking hate when you say things like that.” Agatha murmured, scratching the slope of her nose. “And yes, I still hate how things played out, but I would’ve told Lilia at some point, you know that.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Rio sighed. “I’m going back to my room, because I’m honestly tired of wanting to be with you all night while you clearly, obviously, don’t want to show anyone that I’m yours.”</p><p>Before Rio could turn her back on her, Agatha caught her arm, simply because she couldn’t possibly tolerate going back to the mandatory socializing if this was how their night was going to end.</p><p>“You’re out of your mind if you think I don’t want people to know I have you.” Agatha said softly, tugging Rio’s arm toward her. Rio didn’t resist. “I have no reason whatsoever to be ashamed of our relationship. Quite the opposite— I’m so proud of you, Rio.” </p><p>Agatha placed her hand on the student’s cheek. RIo’s eyes were watery, but the tears were as stubborn as their owner, and refused to fall.</p><p>With Rio still silent, Agatha pressed on. “I at least need to say goodbye to a few people… Why don’t you come with me? I’ll introduce you. Officially.”</p><p>Rio let out a low sound in her throat, but it didn’t stop her voice from coming out small.</p><p>“I don’t think so. I’m really tired, and I think I’ll just go back to my room.”</p><p>Agatha pretended not to be hurt, nodding with a short, tight smile.</p><p>“Okay. Well, I’ll let you know when I’m heading to my room.”</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha closed the space between them for a brief kiss, then just stayed as she watched Rio walk away toward the elevators.</p><p>Fucking shit. </p><p>After taking a few deep breaths (six, because she counted), she returned to the main area, where fewer people lingered but the conversations still buzzed at full volume. Carol waved at her, trying to call her back to the same group. Agatha plastered a plastic smile back on and approached. To her great chagrin, the topic was still cryptocurrencies.</p><p>It was painfully obvious that if Agatha hadn’t been able (or willing) to engage in that conversation before, now the level of her social battery had drained drastically. She nodded at the wrong times, smiled at entirely inappropriate moments —like when they spoke, in outraged tones, about how bitcoin mining demanded an energy expenditure equivalent to two percent of global electricity consumption— at which point Agatha fucking <em> smiled </em>, earning several confused looks.</p><p>That was her cue. </p><p>She started making her goodbyes, and when a calloused, masculine hand landed on her shoulder, she had to restrain herself from screaming in sheer rage. But, being the fully functional adult woman she was, Agatha simply said her farewells, pulled her shoulder out of reach, and breathed out with relief when Stark didn’t venture to share the elevator with her.</p><p>-</p><p>In her room, Agatha waited for a knock on the door, a text message, literally anything.</p><p>Another five minutes passed, and though she was irritated, she was at least relieved she hadn’t changed into her pajamas yet, because seconds later, she was marching two floors down toward Rio’s room.</p><p>She knocked three times with the flat of her hand against the wood, and was about to knock three more when Rio, still in the same clothes as before, opened the door with a smirk tugging at her lips.</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for an invitation and brushed past her.</p><p>“Are you ignoring me?”</p><p>Rio closed the door with a click and poked her tongue against the inside of her cheek, and fuck if Agatha didn’t follow the movement.</p><p>“Nope.” Rio replied, watching the way Agatha —chin tilted, posture rigid— was trying her absolute best to keep her pride in check.</p><p>“Well? What are you waiting for? My room is way better than this one. Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, a half-mocking laugh escaping.</p><p>“You really want me to just walk out like this?”</p><p>Agatha frowned.</p><p>“What do you mean? Like—” Agatha’s words died on her lips when she looked down to figure out what the hell Rio was talking about, and her eyes landed on the obvious bulge in Rio’s pants. She was genuinely surprised she hadn’t noticed it before.</p><p>Rio smirked. “What, Agatha? Suddenly so quiet?”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, and her legs moved almost on their own before her pride could stop them. She sank to her knees in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio was absolutely stunned by the gesture— never in her wildest dreams could she have imagined Agatha Harkness, the Professor, the Witch, on her knees in front of her, unfastening her pants and pulling down the zipper. Agatha’s fingers didn’t hesitate, sliding both Rio’s slacks and underwear down at once.</p><p>A new strap-on, pink this time, was positioned at eye level, attached to a black harness that hugged Rio’s body perfectly. Agatha hadn’t even touched the toy yet, and she could already hear Rio’s ragged breaths filling the silence.</p><p>“I don’t kneel for anyone I’m not proud to call mine, Rio.” Agatha said, her dominant hand closing firmly around the base of the strap.</p><p>Agatha brought the tip of the toy to her tongue, which was waiting, outstretched. After wetting it thoroughly, she drew her tongue back and slowly began taking the pink cock into her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck,” Rio whimpered, a mix of desperation and raw desire tearing through her. Her breathing grew shallower, more frantic, as she watched the pink strap disappear deeper into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>With half the cock in her mouth, Agatha started pulling back to admire how the strap glistened with her own saliva. She lifted her gaze to meet Rio’s: wide-eyed, burning with pure want.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to fuck my mouth with your cock, Rio?”</p><p>Rio moaned.</p><p>“C-Can I?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and gripped the backs of Rio’s thighs, steadying herself.</p><p>“Are you really going to make me wait? Do I have to order you to make me take it?”</p><p>She should’ve thought that through. </p><p>The words had barely left her mouth when Rio pulled her hips forward, driving half the strap into Agatha’s mouth in one swift, brutal motion.</p><p>“Fuck, you look hot like this,” Rio thrust again, triggering Agatha’s gag reflex as the toy slid deep into her mouth. The choked sound that escaped only made Rio moan louder.</p><p>Tears welled in Agatha’s eyes— partly from the intensity, partly from the raw, unfiltered way Rio used her mouth. And Agatha? Well, she asked for it. She could feel her own underwear getting soaked as Rio’s moans grew louder each time the strap hit the back of her throat, each gag echoing like praise.</p><p>After a while, though, Agatha had enough. </p><p>She pulled away, digging her nails into Rio’s skin as, still lost in the frenzy, Rio tried to thrust forward again.</p><p>Agatha rose to her feet, her face streaked with tears —some dry, some still damp— and glistening with spit at the corners of her mouth and down her chin. After Rio took a moment to admire the mess she’d made of Agatha’s face, she kissed her with such force that Agatha stumbled back two steps from the impact.</p><p>It was a kiss of pure desire, edged with desperation, and when Agatha finally pulled away, gasping for air, she pressed her hand firmly against Rio’s collarbone to hold her in place.</p><p>“Take this off.” Agatha commanded, giving the strap a sharp tug.</p><p>“W-what? Why?”</p><p>“Because I said so. Now, Rio.”</p><p>Clearly confused and disappointed, Rio began unfastening the harness until both it and the strap were free from her body, held in her hand.</p><p>“Put it on me. Now.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a conflicted second, then obeyed in silence. She unfastened Agatha’s belt and worked on the single button of her pants, then slid them off along with her underwear completely. </p><p>Within moments, the harness was securely fastened around Agatha’s hips. Unlike the others, this one had no vibrator, and the size was noticeably different. Bigger. If Rio thought she was going to get Agatha impaled tonight… She had another thing coming.</p><p>When Rio stood again, Agatha began removing her blazer. “Why did you think it was a good idea to wear such a tight, scanty top? Hm?” Agatha asked as the blazer dropped to the floor. “Did you really think it was easy keeping my eyes off you tonight?” She wrapped an arm around Rio, her hand finding the zipper at the back of Rio’s top. “You looked fucking delicious, especially after being so, so mad at me.”</p><p>Agatha slid the zipper down in one swift motion. The top, fitted tightly against Rio’s body, didn’t fall, just loosened slightly. Until then, Rio’s shaky breaths were the only sound from her.</p><p>“I <em> was </em> mad at you.”</p><p>“Yeah? And as an act of anger, you came to your room and put on a strap to wait for me?” Agatha let out a low, ironic laugh, sliding her hands over the newly exposed skin of Rio’s back, drawing a noticeable shiver from her.</p><p>“You know how possessive I get over you sometimes.”</p><p>“Sometimes? Baby, if it were up to you, I’d walk around campus with a collar bearing your name.”</p><p>Rio’s body trembled. Agatha smirked.</p><p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha whispered against her ear.</p><p>“Y-yes.”</p><p>“Um, I don’t know,” Agatha clicked her tongue. “You look way better being mine. Wanna see?”</p><p>Rio could only nod. And Agatha knew she’d never tire of the rush of power she felt when she turned Rio into a desperate, wordless mess. Completely and utterly hers.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid back to Rio’s collarbone, and in one swift motion, she tugged the top off and tossed it to the floor. With Rio now completely bare, Agatha guided her toward the vanity, its mirror reaching from one end of the wooden frame to the other.</p><p>“Bend over.”</p><p>Rio began to lean forward, but something made her pause. She straightened her spine and turned back to face Agatha.</p><p>“Take this off?” Rio asked, her hands sliding up the sleeves of Agatha’s blouse.</p><p>Agatha obliged. As soon as her breasts were exposed, Rio’s eyes dropped to them. </p><p>Before Agatha could return to her plan, the student lowered her head and took Agatha’s nipple into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha mewled, feeling Rio’s tongue circle her nipple before sucking deeply, enough to make Agatha release a sharp groan mixed with pleasure and pain. Quickly, Agatha tangled her hand in Rio’s short hair and pulled her away from her chest.</p><p>“You’re so fucking desperate, fuck,” Agatha grumbled, still gripping Rio’s hair, staring at her now swollen lips. “Go, bend over for me, like the good girl I know you are.”</p><p>Praise always worked wonders with Rio. She obeyed instantly.</p><p>Rio arched her body forward, bracing both hands on the edge of the vanity. Behind her, Agatha bit her lower lip, staring at the best sight she’d ever seen: Rio, ass up, legs spread, waiting for her. Thick arousal dripped steadily between Rio’s thighs, pooling slightly on the thankfully non-carpeted floor.</p><p>“How are you literally dripping if I haven’t even touched you yet?” Agatha asked, running her fingers through Rio’s wetness before slicking the strap with it.</p><p>“I’ve been dripping since you got on your knees for me.”</p><p>Impatient, Agatha spat into her own hand, wetting the strap thoroughly before lining it up at Rio’s entrance.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re gonna be able to take me, baby?”</p><p>“Yes, fuck yes.”</p><p>“Look in the mirror.”</p><p>The moment Rio’s eyes met their reflection, Agatha thrust her hips forward, burying the strap inside Rio in one smooth, deep motion. A sharp cry tore from Rio’s throat.  </p><p>“Are you still sure? Do you need me to go easy on you?” Agatha taunted, the strap seated fully inside her but not moving yet.</p><p>“Nonono, please, please,” Rio mumbled, almost incoherent. </p><p>For a moment, Agatha actually hesitated, worried she’d hurt her. Still holding herself back, she pressed her palm firmly against Rio’s lower back.</p><p>“Rio? I’m serious now, do you want me to stop?”</p><p>“NO— Agatha, please, fuck me, please.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, proud of her brave girl. She pulled the strap out completely before driving it back into Rio with no mercy for her pussy, or her cervix, considering the audacity Rio had to buy a strap that size.</p><p>“Look at you,” Agatha said after a particularly deep thrust. “So pretty while taking me from behind.”</p><p>Rio’s moans and cries were sinful. </p><p>Those walls had better be soundproof.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re gonna break me in half, fuck—” Rio managed between ragged breaths and whimpers.</p><p>Agatha’s response was a sharp slap to Rio’s left cheek, the crack echoing loudly— almost drowning out Rio’s voice, if not for the sharp cry she let out. And she kept crying out as Agatha landed two more slaps in the same spot, leaving an instant red blush on her skin.</p><p>“Never again dare to say you’re my dirty secret.” Agatha delivered another sharp slap, never slowing the animalistic rhythm of her thrusts. “You’re mine. My fucking woman. And tomorrow, when you’re limping into my lecture in front of everyone, you’ll remember that.”</p><p>“Yes-yes, I’m j-just yours,” Rio moaned. “I’m close, fuck, Agatha— I’m so close.”</p><p>Agatha kept driving into her without pause, bottoming out with every thrust. When she noticed Rio’s eyes were closed, she spanked her again, right on the same tender spot. “I told you to look in the fucking mirror. You’re going to come watching me fucking you, is that clear?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open, glazed and half-lidded. She turned her head just enough to see herself and Agatha behind her, sweat glistening on her skin as she snapped her hips even faster.</p><p>“Agatha, my-my clit, please—”</p><p>“You need help to come? Is that it, love? Can’t come even with me stretching your tight little pussy?”</p><p>Rio desperately shook her head, biting her lips to baffle the moans.</p><p>“Don’t you dare look away from that mirror.” Agatha commanded, sliding one hand around Rio’s waist until her fingers found Rio’s clit.</p><p>With Rio’s eyes locked on their reflection, her climax hit hard— freezing her whole body for one suspended moment. Agatha kept fucking her, gentler now, until Rio’s body began to tremble uncontrollably under her touch.</p><p>“I’m pulling out now, okay? I’ve got you.” Agatha said softly, her voice tender as she slowly withdrew the strap from Rio’s pussy. Rio whimpered in protest, her body trembling with oversensitivity.</p><p>Her legs were too weak to hold her up, so Agatha wrapped an arm firmly around her waist and guided her gently to the bed.</p><p>Lying on the mattress and still breathing heavily, Rio pulled her by the arm after Agatha removed the harness and strap, placing them on the nightstand beside the bed. Agatha straddled her before lowering herself onto Rio’s body, beginning a slow, worshipful appreciation of every part of her.</p><p>She started with kisses along Rio’s shoulder, trailed down the length of her arm, then pressed her lips gently to her knuckles. With her mouth against Rio’s neck, Agatha licked her damp skin, nipping and teasing, drawing low, breathy grunts from Rio, who remained almost motionless beneath her. She worshiped Rio’s nipples, kissing and sucking until faint red and purple marks bloomed across her skin. </p><p>Rio watched, mesmerized. Most of the time, it was Rio who spent a great time doing this to Agatha, never tiring of calling her beautiful, whispering words that, until now, Agatha had only ever spoken in the dark of night to an unconscious Rio.</p><p>Heart pounding harder than it had any right to, Agatha opened her mouth in that one fleeting second of courage— only to be utterly silenced when Rio’s hand slid between her legs and began massaging her clit.</p><p>Agatha moaned, eyes squeezed shut, and that moment of courage slipped away.</p><p>“You’re so fucking soaked.” Rio whispered, tracing her fingers through Agatha’s wetness. “Did you get this turned on just from fucking me like that?”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes. Blue met hazel. Courage returned, whether Rio was expecting an answer or not.</p><p>“Rio, I—”</p><p>Her words were brutally cut off as, without warning, Rio thrust three fingers into her with a force that nearly lifted Agatha’s body off hers.</p><p>“FUCK, f-fuck,” Agatha whimpered, dropping her head to bite down on Rio’s shoulder, muffling the moans that spilled from her lips without consent.</p><p>After a bite that left a perfect imprint of Agatha’s teeth on Rio’s shoulder, the student switched positions, flipping Agatha onto her back against the mattress.</p><p>“No one’s ever had me like you, Agatha.” Rio said before driving three fingers back inside Agatha’s cunt. “You’re fucking perfect.”</p><p>Rio was already a strong woman, but now she moved with possessed intensity, fucking Agatha with raw, relentless strength. Those three wonderful fingers hitting her G-spot every. Damn. Time.</p><p>“Rio, c-calm down, fuck-fuck-fuck!”</p><p>“I wanna see you go and try to stand for an hour and a half tomorrow after I’m done with you.”</p><p>Rio hooked one of Agatha’s legs over her shoulder, deliberately avoiding her clit with every thrust.</p><p>“Feeling good, my love?” Rio asked, smirking, knowing full well that Agatha couldn’t answer— not while being fucked relentlessly against the headboard. </p><p>Agatha’s head had already knocked against the wooden frame so many times she finally threw a hand behind her to brace herself, which only gave Rio more leverage to pound into her without mercy.</p><p>“Rio, make me come,” Agatha cried out. “Right fucking now!”</p><p>“So bossy…” Rio grinned like a cheshire cat.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t feeling particularly in charge right at the moment. Not with her body sweaty, trembling, and being thoroughly fucked by the brutal force of Rio’s fingers deep inside her cunt. When she added a fourth finger, Agatha screamed.</p><p>The leg that had been hooked over Rio’s shoulder was now guided by her— bent and repositioned over her outstretched leg, turning Agatha sideways, almost face-down on the bed. In this new angle, Rio used one hand to grip Agatha’s ass, spreading her open to keep thrusting her fingers inside her pussy.</p><p>“Rio, oh-mygod, ohgod—”</p><p>“You’re taking me so well, love, fuck— your pussy is clenching around me.”</p><p>“I’m coming, fu-fuck, Rio, I’m—”</p><p>Agatha came with a long, muffled scream into the pillow, and Rio didn’t stop fucking her with all four fingers until Agatha gripped her arm tightly. </p><p>Agatha didn’t even realize she had tears in her eyes until she saw the smudges of mascara on the white pillowcase and sheets. Her body felt like it took minutes to stop trembling, and Rio collapsed onto the bed beside her, equally spent.</p><p>Both of them breathless, Agatha could count on one hand the times in her life she’d had orgasms so strong her lachrymal glands refused to stop working, and this was one of them. She wiped at her damp eyes with the back of her hand, and Rio, ever empathetic, started kissing her face softly. </p><p>That didn’t help at all. In fact, it only made things worse.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered, now dragging the sheet across her face, that familiar surge of boldness returning as Rio smiled at her and looked at her that way.</p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful, Agatha, I’ll never get tired of—”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth snapped shut, her eyes going wide, and Agatha felt her heart climb straight into her throat as she watched Rio’s expression shift from shock to pure joy.</p><p>“I think I just came again.”</p><p>“That’s the first thing you’ve got to say to me? Seriously?”</p><p>Rio cackled, her laughter echoing off the hotel walls.</p><p>“I love you so much.” She exclaimed, getting on her knees on the mattress so she could climb over Agatha and smother her in kisses: her lips, her cheeks, her nose, her neck, all between bursts of laughter.</p><p>Agatha found herself laughing too, not entirely sure why. It couldn’t possibly be that funny that Agatha Harkness had finally pulled her head out of her ass and admitted she loved Rio, right?</p><p>Yeah, not funny. </p><p>Miraculous, maybe.</p><p>“Say it again.” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I fucking love you, Rio Vidal.” Apparently, the first time was the only hard part. Her tongue practically itched to say it a third, fourth, fifth time.</p><p>Rio beamed, that adorable little gap in her smile so close to Agatha’s face that the professor cupped the back of her neck and pulled her in for a kiss— messy, deep, full of tongue.</p><p>“Say it again.” Rio murmured against her lips, making Agatha laugh.</p><p>“I don’t want to spoil you.” Agatha teased, and Rio pouted. “Come on, let’s take a shower, grab your stuff, and head back to my room.”</p><p>“Let’s just sleep here. We’re already here.”</p><p>“Rio, unless you’re willing to call someone to change these sheets, I am <em> not </em> sleeping here.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said with a smile, rolling her eyes. “Only because you love me.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her waist, gave her another kiss, and they both got up.</p><p>Before Rio could step into the shower, Agatha cleared her throat, earning a confused look from her.</p><p>“Go pee first.”</p><p>“Are you serious?” Rio put one hand on her hip, completely naked, while the other hovered over the shower knob.</p><p>“Yes. The last thing either of us wants is you getting a UTI the week before winter break.”</p><p>“I’m not peeing in front of you, Agatha.”</p><p>“<em> Now </em>you’re shy?” Agatha joked, earning a glare. “I’ll set aside some clothes for us then. Just let me know when I can come back in.”</p><p>Sure enough, Rio called her back into the bathroom, and Agatha ended up following her own advice while Rio stood with her back to her, already under the shower. </p><p>The two of them laughed at the ridiculousness of it when Agatha complained she couldn’t pee because Rio kept making water sounds (as if the shower itself wasn’t enough) and was distracting her.</p><p>It was the longest pee of her life.</p><p>-</p><p>Their last day in Salem started with breakfast at the hotel, both of them sore when sitting down. Or standing up. Or walking, in Agatha’s case. The ache reminded her of when she once tried a spinning class and gave up entirely after being sore for days thanks to that damn bike seat.</p><p>Only this time, instead of the bike seat, the culprit was the beautiful woman who had been by her side for the entire event. Rio, still respecting Agatha’s wishes, kept her distance, though always nearby.</p><p>Her lecture went as well as she could have hoped. Her communication was sharp, her authority undeniable, and if she avoided pacing across the stage because of Rio fucking Vidal, no one seemed to notice or care.</p><p>Rio sat in a chair beside the small table holding Agatha’s laptop at the corner of the stage, a quiet source of support and comfort. Every so often, Agatha’s eyes would flicker toward her, and Rio always had an encouraging smile ready.</p><p>An hour and a half passed quickly, and the thirty minutes for questions and discussion wrapped up just as smoothly.</p><p>“I believe our time is up!” Agatha said, drawing a breath. “I’d like to thank Salem University for the opportunity, as well as Dr. Danvers for bringing me to such a meaningful event for such a promising field.” She paused. “And before we close, I’d also like to thank Westview University, my home, and my partner, both on campus and in life, Rio Vidal.” Agatha smiled, her gaze finding Rio, who tried her hardest to keep her expression neutral.</p><p>The room erupted in applause, a standing ovation rising all around them, but Agatha only had eyes for one person.</p><p> </p>
