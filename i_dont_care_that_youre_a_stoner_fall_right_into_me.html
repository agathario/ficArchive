<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Agatha.” Rio grasps Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha spins around, motioning with grabby hands for the merch Rio had bought her. “Agatha, I literally ran into Chappell Roan in the bathroom.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughs so hard while putting her CD in her knapsack she does her signature snort. Rio’s heart flutters at that. “Be serious. We’re both high. You didn’t see shit.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious!”<br/>_____</p>
<p>OR, Two best friends share a joint and go to a concert together. Could something homoerotic happen? (Yes, yes it could. And it does.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>this was inspired by and meant to be for 4/20 but it grew into a fucking monster. i was like “oh this’ll be a little 4,000-word quickie” and then Boom. idk what i expected because agathario probably can't even have quickies. a "quickie" is 2 hours minimum to them. so anyway. hope you enjoy !</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“How do I look?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around to see Agatha admiring her concert outfit in the mirror: shorts that barely covered her ass cheeks, pink cowboy boots, a camo-patterned crop top with the orange “Midwest Princess” text painted on it. To top it off, Agatha was wearing a pink cowboy hat, presumably one of many that would be flooding the auditorium tonight. Rio was really going to have to keep an eye out for her; the girl liked to wander.</p><p> </p><p>“You look great,” Rio says, and then she coughs because she sounds way too hoarse to appear composed. Agatha has been a good friend for two years now, and the last thing she wants to do is ruin one of the few friendships she has with someone who actually wants to hang out with her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shorts sit right on her waist, which causes her navel piercing to stick out. When she bends down to pick up some wrapper or something else equally unimportant, Rio gets to watch the pouch of her stomach fold over her jeans. It looks so biteable. This is really fucking unfair.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you see my belt buckle?” Rio blurts. She taps her finger on the buckle she’d ordered off of eBay specifically for this outfit— Snoopy in a little cowboy hat. It’s holding up her jean shorts, the ones that reach near her knees. She’s got a camouflage tee shirt and high-top green converse to top the look off.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you showed it to me when you got it.” Agatha’s voice holds a teasing lilt.</p><p> </p><p>“But did I show you what I taught myself what to do with it?” Rio glances towards the kitchen and holds up a finger. “Stay right there.” She quickly nabs a Modelo from the fridge and gets back to Agatha’s room. “Watch this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sneaks the bottle cap of the Modelo under her buckle and then snaps her wrist in a way that opens the beer bottle. There’s a hissing noise, and Rio can feel the foam dribble onto her wrist. She looks up at Agatha expectantly. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes wide, Agatha tightly says, “You’re dripping beer onto the floor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck! Sorry.” Rio wipes the beer bottle and holds her hand over the opening. Agatha does not sound happy. Rio realizes too late that to get any sort of paper towels, she’d have to walk and possibly trail the beer around. “Here, I’ll just drink it to get rid of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio—”</p><p> </p><p>Rio brings the bottle to her lips and chugs before Agatha can say another word. Rio was good at chugging drinks; she had the right amount of sensual dissociation and spite. Rio had learned this freshman year, when her and Agatha had been paired up as roommates. Now, in their own apartment senior year, they didn’t go to the same frat parties they used to, but Rio still found herself using this particular skill every so often.</p><p> </p><p>“See? Problem solved.” Rio tilts up the now-empty bottle to Agatha proudly. When the other woman’s jaw twitches, Rio feels her brows furrow in confusion. “Did I do something wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha states. “I just, um, need a fucking joint.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Okay.” Rio stares sorrowfully at the empty beer bottle as Agatha goes into her vanity dresser and picks out the right materials. Rio gingerly places her trash in Agatha’s bin. “Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not a big deal,” Agatha sighs, but Rio can tell there’s something underlying in her words, even if she’s unable to identify it. “You think one joint between us should be enough?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure.” Rio scoots over in Agatha’s direction so that she’s looking over Agatha’s shoulder. “Want me to roll it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your fingers are probably sticky,” Agatha says, and Rio pouts at this. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha expertly rolls a fat one, and Rio has never wanted to be an inanimate object so badly until the moment Agatha’s pink tongue darts out to seal the joint. They’re soon on the balcony, Agatha with her purple lighter in hand.</p><p> </p><p>“You can go first,” Rio tells her, cupping her hands as Agatha flicks the flame to life. Agatha inhales, and Rio smells something floral in the mix when Agatha exhales. “Is that lavender?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we’re going to a concert for a lesbian. I found it fitting.” Agatha flicks the joint a bit before passing it onto Rio. “Don’t worry, there’s still the devil’s lettuce in there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god.” Rio takes her puff, letting the weed burn inside her. When her mouth lets go and Rio subtly licks her dry lips, she swears she can taste Agatha’s strawberry lip gloss. </p><p> </p><p>They get through the first joint before too long, and Agatha hums. “I think I underestimated. You want another one?” At Rio’s nod, she continues. “I’ll go roll up another one, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, feeling the invisible tug of a leash, follows.</p><p> </p><p>Their second joint on the balcony lasts an even shorter amount of time, and Agatha is about to throw the roach away when Rio says, “Wait, I think I can get another one out of there.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s literally just the filter, hon,” Agatha teases, but she hands Rio the bit anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t tell Agatha that she’s sneaking her tongue out and poking the end of the joint with it in hopes she’ll get to find out what Agatha’s spit tastes like; she barely gets to do anything, really, as when she takes an inhale, she immediately coughs at the nasty taste that just entered her lungs. She glumly throws the roach to the ground and grinds it underneath her heel.</p><p> </p><p>“Told you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grumbles and clears her throat. “I just didn’t want to waste.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha extends her hand and cups Rio’s cheek, thumb brushing over her bottom lip. When Rio sharply inhales, Agatha explains, “You had some bits on there.” She looks down at Rio’s socked feet. “Put your shoes on. I wanna call the Uber in ten.”</p><p> </p><p>The venue is already packed. Rio and Agatha had gotten there an hour before the doors opened, and there were already a gaggle of women and lesbians crowded around the door. Agatha spent most of the time waiting in line glaring at the women who brought their boyfriends and loudly insulting them, and Rio spent most of the time shushing her. </p><p> </p><p>The weed starts to really hit while Rio is standing there; she swears someone calls her and Agatha a cute couple, and Agatha doesn’t deny it, instead pulling her closer.</p><p> </p><p>“You wanna go to the bar after this?” Rio asks dumbly.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm. Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>When it was time for them to insert the venue, they got their 21-plus stamps and Agatha pulled Rio to the front by the belt loop of her shorts. Not quite the barricade, but only a few rows off. It was quickly getting crowded, people pushing against each other, and Rio was suddenly very aware of how Agatha’s body would press up against hers. Rio had the misfortune of her hand brushing up against the small of Agatha’s back and, fuck, her skin was so soft. Rio was going to combust, literally explode, and the concert would have to be cancelled. What would happen after that?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns around, her ocean wave eyes boring into Rio’s. Rio could get lost in them sober, but right now, she stood absolutely no chance. It took all the effort in her brain to make sure her jaw wasn’t embarrassingly slack. “I think…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t hear the rest of what she says. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think we got a good spot!” Agatha yells into Rio’s ear, her breath hot. Rio shivers. At this height, she realizes that Agatha’s boots and Rio’s flat sneakers cancel each other out and they’re the same height. Which means her lips—</p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat. “You feel it yet?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs beautifully in a way that it becomes Rio’s new favorite melody. “Oh, yeah.” After a moment, she says, “Ugh, it’s so hot in here,” and for a fleeting moment, Rio truly fears Agatha is going to start stripping. Instead, she takes her bag off.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you mind wearing this?” Agatha asks. “I’ll probably put it back on later, I just need to breathe a little.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, taking the tan crossbody bag and pulling it over her own shoulder, patting it when its found its spot.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, you look good,” Agatha says. “Handsome, even.”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, that was particularly cruel. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs. “Had a feeling you’d like that one.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks owlishly. Agatha had… had a feeling? As in, she’d been thinking about it? But then something hits her in the groin. It’s not desire.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispers. “I have to go to the bathroom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face changes. “I told you to go before we left,” she hisses.</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> did</em>!” Rio sucks on her teeth, embarrassed. “When I come back, I can get some merch for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha taps her chin, liking the idea of not having to wait in line. “Fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Keep our spot.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to worry about me, handsome.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio has to turn away to try and hide her deepening blush at that. She hadn’t been lying; she <em> does </em> need to use the restroom, but most of her time in the stall is spent breathing heavily. Which relaxes her a bit, but this is also a bathroom, so it smells like sweat and piss and five million different types of perfumes. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio goes up to wash her hands, she makes sure they’re fully clean before setting them under the water again so she can splash her face.</p><p> </p><p>A voice interrupts Rio’s mental anguish. “Can you hand me some paper towels?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is halfway to reaching where the brown roll of towels are when she turns to the voice and sees a familiar head of curly red hair. Her jaw drops.</p><p> </p><p>The woman states, “A picture lasts longer.”</p><p> </p><p>Normal people when they run into the concert header in the bathroom: <em> Wow, I’m a big fan! Can you sign my shirt? </em> Or maybe even <em> My favorite lyric you wrote is… </em></p><p> </p><p>What Rio says is, “Isn’t there a bathroom backstage?”</p><p> </p><p>“Someone clogged it. And I need to get into costume, so…” Chappell extends her hand. “Towel, please?”</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t someone walk in here?” Rio asks, like she’s an endless well of questions that people have the time and desire to answer.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s an ‘out of order’ sign on the door. I think you somehow snuck through.” Chappell looks Rio up and down. “You’re cute, but you look pretty rough.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can tell she’s getting emotional. She has to hold back tears when she says, “I’m a coward, Miss Roan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um, you don’t have to call me that,” Chappell says. “I’m only twenty-seven.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s like if Naked in Manhattan and Casual had a baby,” Rio rambles. “Because I’m too chickenshit to ask her out. We’ve been friends for years. What if I ruin it? She’s literally out there—”</p><p> </p><p>“Right now?” Chappell asks. “Well, you’re obviously stoned in some way.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is true, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is she, too?” At Rio’s nod, Chappell shrugs. “Tell her you like her now, and if she reacts badly, just pretend you forgot tomorrow morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brow furrows. “That doesn’t sound like an emotionally mature move.”</p><p> </p><p>Chappell puts her hand on her hip. “And what is it you’re doing, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>Touche. Rio moans and drags her hands across her face. “I think… I am just going to let this fester. And one day, I’ll die.”</p><p> </p><p>Chappell puts her hands up in defeat. “Your cortisol levels.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks for your help, Chappell,” Rio says, and her voice is very serious. “It was nice to meet you. You’re my favorite artist, but if you weren’t, you’d be my artist’s favorite artist. Y’know, like you like to say. Okay. I’m going to go back out now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaves before she can embarrass herself any further. </p><p> </p><p>The merch line is long and boring. A girl passing by asks for Rio’s number, and the words, “Sorry, I’m married,” tumble out of her mouth before she can stuff them back in. <em> Married</em>?! Dating, sure, that’s the kind of fantasy even and especially sober Rio falls asleep to every night. But the idea of Aga— and, oh God, Rio can’t even attach her name to this image, it makes her chest so heavy— the thought of her best friend walking down the aisle? Rio is going to have a stroke and die right here, in the Chappell Roan merch line.</p><p> </p><p>She thinks she’s doing a good job of appearing totally normal until the cashier handing her a CD and two keychains asks, “Are you okay? Your eye is twitching.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio lies. “Just nervous. My first concert.”</p><p> </p><p>The cashier smiles, so Rio must be convincing enough. “Well, this is a good first show to have! Hope you enjoy!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shuffles back to where the crowd around the stage is and realizes too late that Agatha is wearing a pink cowboy hat in a sea of pink cowboy hats. Fuck. She has to push through so many people, trying to think about where her and Agatha were standing last.</p><p> </p><p>And finally, she sees Agatha. It’s just the back, but the shape of her body, her long, thick hair… Rio just knows it’s her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio grasps Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha spins around, motioning with grabby hands for the merch Rio had bought her. “Agatha, I literally ran into Chappell Roan in the bathroom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs so hard while putting her CD in her bag— still attached to Rio, by the way— that she does her signature snort. Rio’s heart flutters at that. “Be serious. We’re both high. You didn’t see shit.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious!” Rio protests. </p><p> </p><p>For the next while, all Rio thinks about is Agatha’s proximity to her. She’d put on some sort of perfume, but it was slowly being mixed with a bunch of other scents. As it gets closer to the starting time of the concert, the crowd grows more packed as impatient fans inch closer and closer to the stage. It means that Agatha starts to lean into Rio more and more, to a point where Rio swears she can smell Agatha sweating. It makes the fragile things in her ribcage beat wildly against their cage. It makes her think dangerous thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>It’s all a blur until the lights are dimming and the drag opening act comes on; they’re all local scenes, which Rio appreciates. The thought of typing all their Venmos in to tip them feels overwhelming, so instead Rio takes pictures of when their usernames flash across the screen so she can get to them later.</p><p> </p><p>When the lights come back on as the crew gets ready for Chappell’s set, Agatha turns to Rio and asks, “Do you think I should take my hat off?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mind is blissfully blank of everything except Agatha’s eyes looking into hers. “Um, why?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just so hot and crowded. It’s either that or I take my shirt off.” At the choking noise that Rio makes, Agatha laughs and says, “It’s okay, I’m just kidding. Sorta.” She loosens the string that fastens the hat to her head and slides it off, letting the hat rest on her shoulders and hang off her. Her hair has been flattened a bit by the hat, and as her fingers dig into her scalp to work some of the volume back, she says, “Could you help?”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio’s hands join Agatha’s in making her hair look a little more presentable, Rio swears she hears a small whine leave Agatha’s lips, but it’s so loud that Rio figures it was just her fantastical imagination. Agatha looks so beautiful here that Rio wants to become a writer and attach words like <em> ethereal </em> and <em> otherworldly </em> to her appearance. A chef could grate Rio’s brain over a bowl of pasta with the amount of cheesy thoughts swimming around in there.</p><p> </p><p>When the lights dim to announce the concert, Rio’s thoughts are interrupted. There’s something about watching an artist sing and dance your favorite songs around a stage that makes the worries in Rio’s mind ebb in a relieving manner. She can smell Agatha’s sweat, sure, but she also gets to sing along to Femininomenon. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows the bits Chappell uses between sets pretty well; she’s seen enough of them on the internet. Which is why when she starts saying something different than usual before Casual, Rio’s ears perk up.</p><p> </p><p>“Situationships are the fucking worst,” Chappell starts, and she takes the mirophone out of its stand so she can walk around. “And the thing about being a gay girl is sometimes you’ll find yourself in a <em> romantic </em> situationship, which can feel even more embarrassing. Raise your hand if you’ve ever been a homoerotic friendship.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course, considering the demographic of Chappell’s audience, Rio can see dozens if not hundreds of hands pop up, along with some self-deprecating cheers. When Agatha raises her hand, Rio shyly puts up her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Me too.” Chappell puts her hand up and gives a little grin. “Hell, I ran into a girl today who told me she’s too afraid to ask out her best friend.” Skipping playfully around stage, Chappell’s eyes scan and audience, and Rio swears on her signed copy of <em> Gideon the Ninth </em> that Chappell stares directly at her. But only for a second. “I think I see her out there now—” and, oh god, Rio feels sick and is going to projectile vomit everywhere, “— but I won’t point her out, because I feel like being nice today. But if that’s her friend beside her, she better hurry up. Friend is cute.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels a sense of relief that she wasn’t completely called out like that, but her heart is still pounding.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway.” Chappell’s eyes sparkle. “Here’s Casual.”</p><p> </p><p>As the song starts, Rio can’t help it. She feels vindicated that Agatha was wrong, and Rio was right. There aren’t a lot of times that this objectively happens, so Rio finds herself nudging Agatha as the crowd starts singing along to cunnilingus in the car. “See? I told you I’d bumped into her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns her head around and her blue eyes are swimming in a feeling Rio can’t recognize. “Too afraid to ask out her best friend?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely voices the third word before Rio realizes the actions to her consequences, as well as what she’s given up, and she swears her heart stops. Every single word that’s ever existed has slipped Rio’s mind, and her only vocabulary to voice her thoughts comes in the form of finding a fainting couch and theatrically putting it to use. So she just says, “Um.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s full body turns around, now, and the crowd is close enough that her and Rio are essentially squished together, two little lesbian sardines: and there was only one can. Agatha’s hands travel up Rio’s torso, and even with her shirt blocking Agatha’s hands from touching her bare skin, Rio feels like she’s experiencing a death sentence in the electric chair. This is what it felt like to be diagnosed with hysteria in the nineteenth century. </p><p> </p><p>“Say it.” Agatha’s hands reach Rio’s face, cupping it. She pulls Rio so that their sweat-slicked foreheads are touching.</p><p> </p><p>“Say what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, ask me the fucking question.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her face heat up. The crowd, the music, Agatha. She blurts out, “Will you be my girlfriend?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha mumbles a word that sounds suspiciously like, “Finally,” while she wraps her arms around Rio’s shoulders and kisses her.</p><p> </p><p>It’s short, too short, but Rio still finds herself breathless when Agatha breaks it, staring her directly in the eye. She keeps that eye contact with Rio as she turns herself around and molds her back into Rio’s front.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmurs. “Put your hands on my hips.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s throat feels like it’s trying to swallow a stone. “Um. Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha guides her hands. When Rio’s fingers slide onto and grip Agatha’s fleshy hips, Agatha leans back into her and purrs, “Good boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her brain short circuit at that. She tightens her hold on Agatha at the praise, and she knows Agatha is chuckling at that. Rio can barely hear the song playing in the background; everything has turned to white noise except Agatha’s breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t think too hard about it right now,” Agatha murmurs into Rio’s ear. Rio can feel her goosebumps rise. “We’re here to have fun, hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, but her hands don’t leave Agatha’s waist. She doesn’t need to say anything, thankfully, because the telltale beginning notes of HOT TO GO! start to play, and both of them look up at the stage. Rio knows it’s Agatha’s favorite song.</p><p> </p><p>When Chappell sings the lyrics <em> call me hot, not pretty!</em>, Rio sacrifices the joy of singing the next few lines of the song to whisper in Agatha’s ear, “You’re really fucking hot, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>With her thumbs pressed into the small of Agatha’s back, Rio gets to relish not only in the way Agatha’s breath hitches, but at the way the little hairs on her skin raise when Rio says those words. It makes Rio feel drunk with power; so drunk that she’s sure, in this very moment, she could seize Vatican City and become the new Pope if she had a plane to get there. </p><p> </p><p>The rest of the concert is a mix of adrenaline, lust, joy. Rio remembers what she’d rambled to Chappell during Naked in Manhattan, and it makes her space feel even more stifled and hot; it’s like she can feel the blood in Agatha’s veins pumping. Or maybe that’s just her heart taking time for its own drum solo, her poor ribcage collateral. Agatha definitely cries during Pink Pony Club, and Rio knows she’ll be in denial about it after, so she tucks it away to remind her later. </p><p> </p><p>After the show, as the crowd disappears, Agatha and Rio stay. This isn’t their first concert, and the mutual agreement is to chill and wait for the bulk of the crowd to leave so their transportation can be easier and cheaper. Also, real concert goers know the slim, but possible, chance of getting goodies if you stay. </p><p> </p><p>And that chance shows itself tonight: the bass player is throwing out a dozen or so guitar picks out to the remaining audience, and Rio rushes up to the stage to catch one. She jumps up and feels a sharp, little shape as she encloses her first, and she victoriously steps down.</p><p> </p><p>Except she doesn’t quite get the footing right, and she stumbles back a little before tripping and falling.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Agatha runs to her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her palm to see a guitar pick safely in it. “I got one!”</p><p> </p><p>“Take my hand, you idiot.” Rio takes Agatha’s warm hand in hers, and squeals as she’s lifted up. She’s a little thankful, because the thought of having to touch the floor to lift herself up sounds horrendous. “Did you hit your head?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think so, but.” Rio flicks the guitar pick so that it sticks out between her two fingers, and she shoots Agatha a goofy grin. “M’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tongue pokes the inside of her cheek, presumably to hide her embarrassment, as she tucks it into her pocket and pats it, like that action will assuredly keep it safer. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow and repeats Rio’s phrasing. “... So.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio wants to be brave, but she feels like she’s being choked, and not in the fun way. “It’s really hot in here. Want to get outside? I want to go outside.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course, it’s cold outside. It shouldn’t feel that way— it’s mid-September. Fucking global warming. Rio can feel goosebumps on Agatha’s arms, and she wishes she had a jacket to give her. Rio bites her lip when she notices Agatha is definitely looking a few inches below where her eyes are. “Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha doesn’t look up from Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I just—” Rio feels all wiggly, like a worm. “When you said <em> finally </em>—”</p><p> </p><p>“I meant, ugh, finally, you asked me out,” Agatha interrupts. “Just kiss me, silly.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, the type who loves following Agatha’s orders, cradles Agatha’s jaw before crashing their lips together. Agatha doesn’t hesitate, opening her mouth so Rio’s tongue can crawl in and explore. Rio is just beginning to get used to the addicting taste of Agatha’s spit when—</p><p> </p><p>“Hell yeah!” A whoop. A few claps. There’s another voice that sounds disgustingly male. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls herself from Agatha’s mouth, gasping at the loss of contact. Agatha’s eyes are even glassier than they were inside. Rio grabs Agatha’s wrists and grumbles, “Follow me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t quite know where she’s going, but she finds an emptier part of the venue’s small parking lot. People here are either getting in their cars or gridlocked trying to get onto the interstate. </p><p> </p><p>The intermittent street lamps create some sort of halo surrounding Agatha’s wild mane of hair. She asks, “Why’d you stop?”</p><p> </p><p>The possessive part of Rio’s spirit takes over when she says, “I don’t want anyone seeing that. It’s for us. It’s for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes darken into a midnight storm. “What took you so long?”</p><p> </p><p>“What took <em> me </em> so long?” Rio gasps as Agatha’s hand slips under her shirt to caress the small of her back. “Agatha, I barely knew you felt this way until, like, tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“You cannot be serious.” Agatha sucks on her teeth. “I know I have a flirtatious personality, but—”</p><p> </p><p>“Flirtatious?” Rio’s brows furrow. “I don’t think you’re flirtatious.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think I’ve been doing, Rio?” Agatha sighs. “Do you really think I miscalculated those joints? Do you think I told that girl we were dating because I wanted to be a cockblocking asshole?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just thought fate hated me,” Rio admits. “Or that, I dunno, you didn’t really mean it. ‘Cause you never said anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was surface level flirting at first,” Agatha confesses. “I still remember the look on your face when I ‘accidentally’ left my towel in the hamper and had to get it buck-ass naked—”</p><p> </p><p>“So that <em> was </em> on purpose.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickers. “Yeah, but after a time… we actually got close. And I liked making you blush, but you never said anything, either. And I didn’t want to ruin what we had.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are we going to?” Rio whispers, fear creeping into her voice. “Are you sure that you…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I do,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her heart spilling out when she continues. “We’re just both high, and if I wake up tomorrow and you don’t mean it like I do, or hell, if this is some sort of dream, I don’t know what I’ll do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, sweetheart.” Agatha cups Rio’s face, pulls Rio’s ear towards her mouth. “Don’t get it twisted: I want you to get an Uber, I want you to take us home, and I want you to fuck me until it hurts to walk tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cannot whip out her phone fast enough.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes that seem like an eternity later, Agatha’s squirming in the Uber. Rio decides to sit in the middle seat so her and Agatha’s thighs can touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Buckle your seatbelt,” Rio whispers, and Agatha glares at her. But Rio means business, and her own stare wins, because Agatha grumbles and clicks herself in. Rio smirks. “Good girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha’s body shudders in the window-tinted moonlight. Finally, score one for Rio. Her hand inches up Agatha’s bare thigh, fingertips gently brushing over soft skin.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio says softly, and even in the dim light, she can see Agatha’s cheeks color. “I’ve wanted to tell you that so many times, and now that I know you like hearing it, I’m not gonna stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grits her teeth impatiently as Rio’s hand goes up, up, up until she’s squeezing the flesh of Agatha’s upper thigh. Rio pressed her thumb into the dimpled skin, and she knows it’s the same spot Agatha complains about when her jeans inevitably chafe. If they weren’t in a car, Rio would bend down to kiss and suck on it. For now, she digs her thumbnail in.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s whine sounds stifled.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio’s thumb then darts under Agatha’s shorts to caress the velvet crux of her thigh and groin. She can feel coarse hair, and she groans. “Thank god.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dazedly says, “Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs. “I dunno. You could’ve been the type to, like, shave bare or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha makes a noise of disgust. “Who do you think I am. She’s never seen a razor in her life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Rio states. She lowers her voice. “I like a woman with hair. I like when they get so wet it ruins their bush.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fuzzy eyes sharpen just a bit to glare at Rio as she crosses her legs, trapping Rio’s hand and rendering it unable to move. “They? As in, plural?”</p><p> </p><p>Whoops. That was, in all honesty, not what Rio meant. “No, no. What I meant to say, was…” Rio cowers under Agatha’s expression as enough correct words come to mind so that she can string together a sentence. It’s a macaroni art project of a sentence, but that’s better than nothing. “You’re everything I’ve imagined. Even more. Because, like, I have. Imagined you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha doesn’t uncross her legs, but she does lower them so she’s crossing them at the ankles. Progress. “Tell me more.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um.” Rio gets so close to Agatha’s ear she can feel her breath as her voice becomes quiet enough that there’s no timbre behind it. “I’ve thought about… if you trimmed or shaved, obviously. And I’m glad to learn that you don’t, because I like the idea of pulling at your hair if you get naughty. Knowing you, you’re probably a big fucking brat.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles airily at that and she wriggles closer to Rio. “Pleading the fifth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm.” Rio continues, her thoughts spilling out of her now that the dam has broken. “I’ve thought about how, if you’re turned on enough, if I’d be able to see your clit peeking out. If your lips are long enough that they hang a little, if that means that when you get wet, you ruin your underwear. And I’ve thought about how many fingers you like. How cute you’d sound begging me to just put one more in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s panting, now. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> </p><p>“He is <em> not </em> here,” Rio grumbles.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, are you guys going to get out?” Rio jumps as she looks at Agatha and they realize the car has been stopped for… damn, who knows how long. Hopefully not an embarrassing amount of time. Rio is too scared to look at the Uber driver’s face to see if they were able to overhear the conversation. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh, yeah, sorry. Thanks.” Rio leans over Agatha to open the door for her and they stumble out of the sedan. </p><p> </p><p>When the car speeds off, Agatha says, “Do you think he—”</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t matter. I’ll rate him five stars in the morning.” Rio pushes Agatha by the small of her back. “We need to get <em> inside</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The door is barely closed before Rio’s grabbing Agatha’s hips and kissing her. Rio loves kissing Agatha. Rio is in love with kissing Agatha. It’s messy, both of them excited and flying and shaking. Rio dares to rest one of her hands on Agatha’s stomach so that when Agatha’s stomach twitches, she can feel the metal of Agatha’s navel piercing brush up against her palm.</p><p> </p><p>“Bedroom,” Agatha murmurs against Rio’s lips. Agatha must decide Rio takes too long to respond, because she breaks the kiss. Rio whines, and she can feel a line of spit break and drip down her chin. Agatha repeats herself. “Rio. Bedroom.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yours or mine?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mine,” Agatha says, like it’s the clear answer. “Yours is going to become the guest room, obviously.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart stutters in a medically dangerous way from the implications of that statement. She reaches out to kiss Agatha again and is so incredibly grateful when Agatha accepts, and Rio licks into Agatha’s mouth like it holds the step-by-step process for Rio acquiring her deepest desire. And maybe, in a way, it does.</p><p> </p><p>They slowly shuffle to the bedroom. And, oh! Rio digs into Agatha’s pocket; her not-friend almost squawks in surprise and slight offense.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls out the guitar pick she’d handed Agatha not too long ago and pointedly puts it on Agatha’s chest of drawers. “I wanted to make sure it didn’t get lost. I got it for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s pseudo-outrage turns into a soft expression as she pulls Rio in by her jean’s belt loops to kiss her again. Agatha is persistent in her quest to map Rio’s body with her fingers, and every touch she gives Rio is like a shock to her spinal cord. Rio finds herself having to remind her lungs to breathe in and out.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, fuck.” Even without Agatha’s hands on her, Rio would feel like she’s floating. At this rate, she’s going to be the world’s youngest astronaut. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so hot.” Agatha rips Rio’s shirt up to untuck it from her jeans, and she moans when Rio’s bare nipples harden in the cold air. “You always fucking do this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s panting when she says, “They’re small enough to get away with it, so…”</p><p> </p><p>“I fucking know that, but then I have to always see it.” Agatha whines as her hands skirt up Rio’s torso, her fingers finally landing where they want to be when she tweaks both of Rio’s nipples at the same time. Rio squeaks. Agatha laughs at the noise. “Oh, you’re sensitive.”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pushes Rio onto the bed and captures a dusky nipple in her mouth, Rio mewls, her body arching into Agatha. Agatha doesn’t hesitate to spend the next few minutes switching between sucking on her nipples and biting bruises onto Rio’s breasts and sternum. The swinging pendulum between pleasure and pain has Rio seeing stars. She’s known about Agatha’s witty and catlike mouth for a while now, obviously, but learning how she uses it when she wants to claim a body is making Rio sticky. She bites her lip and has to keep from rubbing her thighs together. Agatha’s eyes zone in on the movement like a cat to a laser. Her hands move to start unbuckling Rio’s belt, and then she curses.</p><p> </p><p>“This stupid fucking vintage belt,” Agatha mutters. “Why couldn’t you have worn a normal belt?”</p><p> </p><p>“Snoopy,” Rio says, the full explanation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hides her snicker behind a sigh. “Of course. Take it off for me, cowboy?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands shake as she undoes the clasp of the belt buckle, and her belt has barely created enough space around her waist before Agatha is pulling Rio’s jean shorts down, leaving her bottom half in her heather gray boxer briefs. </p><p> </p><p>“Lay down,” Agatha growls, and Rio crawls backwards onto Agatha’s queen. When Rio instinctively spreads her legs, Agatha hums smugly. “Oh, I can see how much you need this.” Rio tries to close her legs in shame, but Agatha’s wrist darts out and she puts her palm flat on Rio’s covered pubic mound before she can. “Hell no. I want to see it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can I see you?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answers by tugging her crop top up. It’s tight enough that Agatha has to push it over her breasts before fully taking it off— Rio moans at the pink balconette bra Agatha’s wearing and quickly takes her own tee off, leaving her in just her underwear and socks.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so pretty,” Rio says, mesmerized. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushes the same color as her lingerie. When Rio’s hands inch up to unbutton the fly of her jeans, Agatha smacks them away. “No. I’m focused on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts, remembering something Agatha had said their sophomore year— that she liked to get girls off first so they could spend the rest of the night paying attention to her.</p><p> </p><p>Like she can read Rio’s mind, Agatha says, “Not like that. I…” Her voice gets lower, rougher. “I really need to taste you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes roll into the back of her head in pleasure as Agatha teasingly presses into the wet spot Rio has created on her boxers before finally tugging them off. The marijuana in her system heightens her already haywire senses; Agatha’s fingers pressing into her thighs feels sharp and heavy. When Agatha spreads Rio’s lower lips open like the pages of her favorite book (which she knows to be <em> Frankenstein </em>), Rio whimpers. </p><p> </p><p>She waits for Agatha to start, or to even be a little cruel and blow cold air on her pulsing clit, but there’s nothing. Only the heavy breathing of two sets of lungs. Rio whines. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, sorry.” Agatha’s grip on Rio’s thighs tighten as she comes back from whatever train of thought she’d been chugging along on. “I… got lost. You’re so… oh my god.” That’s when Agatha finally takes her tongue and slides it up Rio’s pussy, and Rio cries out, her hand flying to Agatha’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha licks up the wetness seeping from Rio’s entrance like it’s contributing to the rising sea levels and she’s an environmentalist. Rio finds herself clenching on the very tip of Agatha’s tongue, like her cunt is begging Agatha to put something worthwhile in there. Agatha must get the subliminal messaging, because when she moves up to deliver kitten licks to Rio’s clit and teases two fingers, Rio yelps. “Yes, baby, right there.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans and its vibrations shoot straight into the deepest parts of Rio’s gut. Agatha enters her fingers in and Rio feels unimaginably full. Her hips start to move to the rhythm of Agatha’s slow, steady pumping. It takes an embarrassingly short time for Rio’s thighs to start trembling. Her orgasm is spiky and hot, and she can feel Agatha slurping her up around her pumping fingers. The ride of her climax lasts longer than usual, and the aftershocks leave Rio gasping for air like a fish out of water.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s thighs loosen their bracket around Agatha’s head, Agatha’s lips leave Rio’s clit and Rio whimpers at the momentary loss, but Agatha’s thumb quickly replaces it. Agatha uses the fact that her mouth is free to talk. “You like that, good boy?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cries out. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha growls. “My good boy.” Rio can’t respond verbally to that; she only nods. “This better than you imagine?”</p><p> </p><p>“So much better than my dreams,” Rio babbles, and she moans as Agatha’s fingers move positions within her. When Rio opens her eyes, Agatha’s face is inches from her.</p><p> </p><p>“You dreamt of this, too?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Rio can feel her guts clenching at the way Agatha simultaneously drives her fingers into her and jams her thumb on her clitoris. “You feel so good.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> You </em> feel so good.” Agatha continues her movements, but Rio can feel Agatha’s breath mingle with her own. “You’re so pretty when you come, did you know that?” When Rio shakes her head mechanically, Agatha continues. “You take me so well.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can already feel the metaphorical wire in her gut about to snap. Tears pricking the corners of her eyes, she says, “I’m gonna come again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs: a mix of wonder and teasing. “Of course you’re this easy. Clenching on my fingers like it’s your fucking job. You gonna come for me again, pretty boy?” When Rio’s orgasm starts up and her moans start breaking, Agatha smirks. “Knew it. So, so easy.”</p><p> </p><p>“F-for you,” Rio cries out, and then she sees stars. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues to fuck her, but Rio feels like it’s too overwhelming, and before Agatha can give her another climax, she gently clasps Agatha’s wrist and says, “M’sensitive.” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, baby.” Agatha takes her fingers out of Rio and quickly puts them in her mouth. Rio's eyes are trained on the way Agatha’s tongue peeks out to get every drop. Agatha clarifies, “I’d have you do it, but, I wanted to taste you again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel the heat spreading on her chest as she breathes heavily. Like she’d just run a marathon. She sits up so she can get a better look at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Want a taste?” Agatha hovers over Rio and presses their lips together. Rio thinks she could kiss Agatha forever. Agatha is cunning and quick, straddling Rio and shoving her tongue down Rio’s throat like it belonged there. Rio lets her, moaning at how Agatha practically massages her soft palette with how hard she’s pushing and swiping her tongue. When Agatha cups her face with both hands, Rio sucks on Agatha’s tongue and pushes her knee up. Agatha groans at the sensation and her body and hips jump with the movement.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks the kiss, but not before dragging her teeth across Rio’s plump and quickly-bruising bottom lip. “Don’t tease,” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>“Not on purpose.” Rio’s hands skirt up Agatha’s bare torso. It’s so warm. “You’re so fucking beautiful.” Rio presses herself against Agatha as much as she can before fiddling with the back clasps of Agatha’s bra. She’s got three hooks on hers, and they’re starting to become a big menace. Rio mutters, “This is why I don’t fucking wear these.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha airily chuckles at Rio’s frustration, and she puts her own hands behind her back to help Rio unclasp her bra. Their fingers intertwine and Rio, now close to Agatha’s jutted-out chest, finds her breath stolen when the garment finally drops, leaving Agatha’s breasts bare.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy fuck.” Agatha’s pebbling nipples are literally inches from Rio’s face. “Um, pinch me?”</p><p> </p><p>She can practically hear Agatha’s blush. “You’re not dreaming, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve gotta be.” Rio’s hands are slightly shaking when she brings them up to cup Agatha’s breasts. Her thumbs simultaneously brush over Agatha’s nipples. Rio quickly puts one in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Agatha pushes herself even further into Rio as Rio gently laps at the nipple. She enjoys the way it sits in her mouth; first it’s soft, but as Rio works at it, the nipple gets harder and more sensitive. She sucks on it gently between her top teeth and her tongue, curling the muscle in a way that has Agatha arching her back. Ripe’s fingers start tweaking Agatha’s neglected nipple as Rio pops the one in her mouth out and blows on it, letting the remnants of her spit stiffen it impossibly more.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio starts sucking a hickey into the underside of Agatha’s breast, she takes advantage of her new angle and looks up, locking eyes with Agatha. Agatha’s eyes are like sea glass, smooth and colorful and dark. Rio can practically see her reflection in them, which admittedly upsets her a little; she wants to see Agatha right now, not herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brushes a stray lock of hair from Rio’s forehead as if to see her clearer. “We could’ve had this sooner.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frees her mouth to respond with, “But we have it now.” She darts a hand into Agatha’s jeans, if they could even be called that with regards to how much they cover, and she cups Agatha’s sex. She can tell by the shape of the underwear that Agatha’s wearing a thong. Agatha’s breath hitches as Rio rubs her palm across the hair of her mons pubis. Her mouth waters. “Get under me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs Agatha by the hips and flips them so Rio is hovering over her. Agatha’s breasts flatten out a little at the change, but her nipples still stand at attention. Rio impulsively flicks one hard, and Agatha squeaks. Rio then scoots down so she can take Agatha’s thighs and lift them up. Agatha whines at the movement, and Rio’s groan joins the choir when she realizes that Agatha’s shorts are so fucking short that her inner thighs show. Rio has to stop herself from drooling when she realizes Agatha’s bush peters out to her thighs, and she can see the dark, curly hair as she looks closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Rio starts messily pulling down Agatha’s jeans. “This needs to come off.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shimmies her hips so Rio can get her bottoms off more easily, though she complains when Rio uses a little too much force to get her thong off. “Be careful. That’s brand new.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio realizes too late— as in, the exact moment she lets go of the thong to toss it across the bedroom— that it’s the same pink as Agatha’s bra. “Wait. Did you buy a set?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks darken. “I just wanted to look nice.”</p><p> </p><p>“For who?” Rio’s voice turns into a growl. She brushes her thumb alongside Agatha’s labia majora, digging the nails of her other hand into Agatha’s thigh when Agatha whimpers. “For who, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“It could’ve been anyone,” Agatha admits. “But I wanted it to be you.”</p><p> </p><p>“It <em> is </em>me.” Rio possessively grabs Agatha, her two fingers sliding over Agatha’s protruding lips and swollen clitoris. “Only I get to see you like this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha cries out. “God, Rio, please, just fucking touch me. I’ve waited this long.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slips two fingers into Agatha, her chest fluttering when Agatha’s moan edges on just the right amount of relief to not sound too pathetic. Agatha is so wet Rio can practically feel her fingers pruning. The sound of Rio’s fingers inside Agatha is obscene and extremely sexy. Agatha’s hips are meeting Rio where her fingers are, shamelessly grinding. </p><p> </p><p>A thought wiggles its way into Rio’s brain. Like a worm, it burrows deeper and deeper until it’s all-consuming, so Rio takes her fingers out of Agatha (to the complaint of the recipient, obviously) and takes a peek at them. Covered in Agatha’s desire; some of it was translucent, but there were patches of creamy white here and there. Rio brings her fingers to her mouth and moans at Agatha’s taste. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers dive into Agatha’s cunt yet again so that she can get another taste before Agatha’s hooded eyes are glaring at Rio sucking on her fingers and hissing, “Just use your fucking mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>Great idea. Rio clambers down and even before she spreads Agatha’s lips, she’s speechless at how pretty and pulsing and pink Agatha is. It makes Rio dizzy. It gives Rio the clarifying (read: high) thought of, well yes, this is why men go to war or write poetry or whatever. Agatha’s desire has smeared across her bush, making parts of it just as wet and throbbing as the most sensitive parts of her. Rio would trim it with her teeth if Agatha asked her to, really.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tease,” Agatha whines just as Rio puts her mouth to work. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tastes fucking divine. Rio would be stupid enough to compare Agatha’s cunt to Aphrodite’s and start the Trojan War if one gave her a megaphone loud enough. Rio ate Agatha out messily, not caring about the slurping sounds that left her lips or the juice that dripped down her chin. That’s just what happens when you eat a fruit ripe enough, Rio thinks. Agatha tugs on her hair, directing Rio where to go, and Rio is okay with this as long as she’s still allowed to memorize the tang coating her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands snake under Agatha’s thighs to pin them down, because Agatha apparently likes to wiggle. It means Rio can’t fiddle with Agatha’s moving navel piercing as Agatha spasms under Rio’s touch, but she’ll live.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s grip on Rio’s hair tightens and Rio realizes she’s about to come, Rio delicately pulls back the hood of Agatha’s clitoris with her tongue and presses it down flat on the most reactive part of Agatha’s body. When Agatha peaks, she repeats Rio’s name. <em> Rio. Rio. Rio! </em> It sounds like gospel, and in this vision, Rio is being handed a message straight from God in the burning bush. She dips down to collect the orgasm Agatha’s vaginal walls squeeze out of her and savors every last drop. Rio knows in this moment she’d crawl through miles of dusty desert to get a hold of this oasis even just one more time.</p><p> </p><p>She continues to lap at Agatha’s cunt, hoping to wring as many orgasms out of Agatha as she’ll allow. However, before her brain can conjure up another fuddled metaphor, she finds her eyes flying open— when had they closed?—  and Agatha sitting up, tapping her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ, Rio.” Agatha cups Rio’s jaw. “Did you forget to breathe?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh. Rio realizes now that she’s gulping in the cool air of the bedroom like she’d started to whittle away from oxygen deprivation. And maybe she had; but it’s unfair, considering Rio doesn’t have to remind her lungs to inflate when her tongue <em> isn’t </em> inches deep in Agatha’s delectable pussy, so why would she need to remind them to do their job when she <em> is</em>? </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry.” Rio should hate how her voice makes her sound like a pathetic puppy, but it only makes Agatha’s eyes soften like a spring sky. Her thumb brushes over Rio’s bottom lip, and Rio takes the invitation for what it is and opens her mouth, sucking on Agatha’s thumb tip.</p><p> </p><p>“Eating my pussy until you pass out.” The dirty talk creates a waver in Agatha’s tone. “It’s cute.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nips on Agatha’s fingertip at those words, which makes Agatha growl, grabbing Rio by the lower lip and tugging her up. The movement has Rio realizing her face is still wet.</p><p> </p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen, handsome.” Agatha’s next words sound like they’ve been thrown into a rock tumbler. “You’re going to get up, grab that green cock I know you’ve got tucked into your nightstand, and you’re going to sit pretty while I ride you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can only nod dumbly before collecting her limbs in a logistical manner and walking, one step at a time, to her bedroom to direct her trembling hands to the drawer she’s got her equipment in. She’s back in Agatha’s bedroom in record time, holding her harness in one hand and her dick in the other.</p><p> </p><p>“I might need help,” she admits.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d love to be that for you,” Agatha coos, and she beckons Rio to stand next to where she placed herself on the edge of the bed. Rio can only stare at Agatha as Agatha guides her into the harness’s legs, tightens it so it fits on her thighs and ass snugly, and even dips into the bulky part with the O-ring to double check and make sure it’s hitting Rio right in the clit. She shudders.</p><p> </p><p>As Agatha methodically places Rio’s cock through the O-ring, she says, “I want to tell you a secret.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio answers dreamily. Agatha could have told Rio to hand over the nuclear codes and Rio’s answer would have been the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Remember when you went to California for spring break?” At Rio’s nod, Agatha continues. “I found your strap in the nightstand, and…” Her next words are quieter. “I fucked myself with it.”</p><p> </p><p>What? “What?” Rio looks down at Agatha, electric-shocked brown locking into blue.</p><p> </p><p>“I fucked myself with your cock,” Agatha repeats, her breath trembling. </p><p> </p><p>“But that was…” Oh, now was not the time for math. “Months and months ago.” Rio feels like she’s treading water in her own brain fluid. “Did you imagine me on the other end of it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s done fitting Rio’s cock now, and her hand splays against Rio’s thigh. “Why do you think I spent twenty minutes rifling through your shit to find it, instead of using one of my own?”</p><p> </p><p>Something snaps inside of Rio; it’s like a red cape has been waved flirtatiously in front of her mind’s eye one too many times, and the bull has broken through the iron gates to finally get a grasp on it. She grabs Agatha’s wrists and uses the strength she has from her weekly gym workouts to spin Agatha around and bend her over, pinning her to the bed. Agatha’s legs dangle without touching the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure I’m going to ride you,” Agatha quips.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio growls, and she probably sounds like a fucking rabid animal. “You’re going to do what I say now.” Rio gets up on the bed, pushing Agatha so that she scoots up and Rio’s thighs can properly bracket her body. Rio’s cock juts out and brushes over the small of Agatha’s back as she squirms in her new position. “You fucked yourself on my cock?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whines.</p><p> </p><p>“What position.”</p><p> </p><p>“Umm.” The cogs of Agatha’s brain practically hum as they’re put into overdrive. “I rode it. And then I fucked myself with it so hard I squirted. I had to change my sheets.”</p><p> </p><p>“You… squirted.” Rio’s brain short circuits. Her hands roughly squeeze Agatha’s ass cheeks as she slides her cock in between them. Agatha whines. Rio inhales a shaky breath before fully breaking, her voice cracking as she cries out, “You squirted on my cock and I <em> wasn’t there</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry, baby.” Agatha strains as Rio starts gently humping, her cock sliding nicely but not where Agatha desperately needs it. “Let me make it up to you. I can squirt on it right now. I’ll be so good for you, I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” And with that, Rio guides her cock and smears its head around Agatha’s slick before pushing into her. Agatha sobs in relief when the pressure of Rio’s dick fills her. Rio spreads Agatha’s ass cheeks so she can watch as Agatha takes her. When Rio slides out a bit so she can thrust into her, she notices the grip Agatha’s cunt has on Rio’s cock, like it’s too afraid to let go. She mumbles, “Fuck, you’re so tight.”</p><p> </p><p>“S’for you,” Agatha babbles. “This pussy’s for you, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“Such a gorgeous pussy, too.” Rio slides her hands up Agatha’s back, digging her thumbs into the muscles before she reaches Agatha’s shoulders. Then, Rio sits up on her knees a little so that her body hovers parallel to Agatha, and so that when she hammers her cock into Agatha, gravity helps her bring it home. “You’re going to be good for me and squirt all over my dick until you have to beg me to stop, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha keens as Rio starts to rhythmically thrust into her. “Yes! Yes, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” One of Rio’s hands gently rests on Agatha’s throat as she brings her lips up to Agatha’s ear. “Say that again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, please, please, sir.” Agatha is basically rambling now. “Give me your cock. Fucking pound me. Fuck me so hard you create an indent in the mattress that lasts for a week. Don’t hold back, sir, please.”</p><p> </p><p>“Christ.” Rio lifts her hips up higher than she planned before slamming them back down. Agatha cries out, and Rio continues. “Do you hear that? You’re so fucking wet.”</p><p> </p><p>“You… oh, god.” Agatha moans as Rio presumably hits an angle that feels good. “I knew the second I put your cock in me it’d be the only one to fuck me right.”</p><p> </p><p>“You better never do that shit again.” Rio presses harder into Agatha’s throat, pushing back so Agatha can lift her neck up just enough to make shaky eye contact. “I better feel how wet and ready you are for me every time.”</p><p> </p><p>Every time, like there will be a next one. God, of course there will be. Unshed tears pearl at the end of Agatha’s eyes. “Yes, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“Again,” Rio growls. Agatha calling her <em> sir </em> makes Rio feel dizzy with power. She’d be satisfied if it was the only word she heard for the rest of her messy lesbian life.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, sir!” Agatha yelps. “Fuck me until I pass out. And then maybe fuck me some more. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Woof. Rio will visit that aspect and now-fantasy later. “Right now, I want you squirting on my cock like you promised.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips snap up to meet Rio’s, like she wants Rio’s dick as nestled into her as possible for every thrust. “I’m… I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>“No clitoral stimulation?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need it.”</p><p> </p><p>“My greedy angel,” Rio murmurs. “My girl.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, sir.” Agatha’s panting now. “Oh, god, say that again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Which part?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s face and chest heat up a little as she says, in a small voice, “That first one. I like being your angel.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses the shell of Agatha’s ear, relishes in the responding shudder. “Touch your clit for me, angel. I know you don’t need it, but you deserve it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha works a hand under her stomach to start rubbing herself. “Oh my god, I’m so wet.”</p><p> </p><p>“For me, right, baby?” Agatha nods at Rio’s words almost pathetically. Rio switches up from deep, slow thrusts to fast, shallow ones, thrusting her hips so that the tip of her cock can press deep into Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a long cry as her orgasm hits her. Rio notices that Agatha’s hand slows, so she takes her own hand from Agatha’s throat and slips it beneath Agatha’s seizing body to start furiously stroking Agatha’s swollen clitoris, two fingers right on its tip. Agatha screams at that, raw, like something is trying to climb out of her throat. When Rio feels liquid gush out as she thrusts into Agatha’s abused cunt, she smirks. “There we go, angel. I think we can go again, though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, fuck.” Agatha’s voice is rough.</p><p> </p><p>“Squirt on it again!” Rio quickens the pace of her hips and adds another finger to rub at Agatha’s clit, going in deep, wide circles and making sure to press down as she does so. Her other hand tightly grips the bedsheets next to Agatha’s head, and Agatha whines as her hair becomes part of the crossfire. “Take my cock like the good girl you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna be so good for you,” Agatha sobs.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re mine.” It’s meant to come out possessive and hot, but Rio ends up sounding a little fearful.</p><p> </p><p>“I am,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>“My angel.” At Agatha’s nod, Rio continues. “My… my girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans and her hands reach out to grab ahold of Rio’s forearm, the one flexing next to her as Rio pounds into her. “Of course I’m your fucking girlfriend, Rio. I’m yours. I’m your girlfriend. I’m your cocksleeve. Fuck!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s body tense up underneath her, and she takes Agatha’s clit between two of her fingers and essentially jerks it off. Agatha’s whimpering leaves her register and her screams become silent as another orgasm wracks over her. Rio keeps pounding, not just to elongate Agatha’s pleasure, but because she feels something accumulating in her own body. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna come,” Rio sputters out. “Wanna come inside you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You got it.” Agatha’s voice is rough. “I’m already close again. You’re so good at fucking me. Come with me. Fuck. Fuck, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes both of hands to hold onto Agatha’s hips like that could possibly run away from her; she pounds into Agatha and bucks her hips in a way that makes the base of the harness rub delicious pressure into her clit. </p><p> </p><p>“Take my cock,” Rio grunts. “Take my come.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Agatha cries, and Rio feels her orgasm roll over her. She impulsively falls and puts her full body weight on Agatha as she bites hard into the junction between Agatha’s shoulder and neck as her hips pump and ride out the aftershocks of her tidal wave climax. Rio can both feel and hear when Agatha comes again; she’s sure if Agatha rolled over there’d be a wet spot in the bedsheets. God, Rio kinda wants to suck the sheets dry knowing what they’re soaked with. Anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peppers her bite with kisses as her hips slow until Agatha whines, “Hold me.” Rio empties Agatha of her dick, sliding beside Agatha on the side that makes them face each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes remind Rio of sparkling sapphire gemstones. She shyly says, “Hi.”</p><p> </p><p>When she starts to undo the straps to her harness, Agatha purrs, “C’mon, you don’t wanna put it back inside me and sleep that way?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs breathily and ignores the way her stomach starts to simmer at that image. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>In the end, Agatha helps her slip out of it and toss it onto the floor. Morning Rio can clean it, she decides. “Don’t worry, sweetheart, I was being facetious. For now.”</p><p> </p><p>With nothing in the way, now, Rio can pull Agatha by the hip that’s not dipping into the mattress so that their bare bodies are touching. Rio’s hand skirts up Agatha’s back, rubbing it absentmindedly. When Rio leans in to kiss her, she waits, for just a second. There’s something intimate about her and Agatha’s lips being inches from each other, from Agatha’s eyes looking into hers, knowing what will inevitably happen. It’s one of those in-between moments, one that some might overlook, but Rio is learning and deciding that, with Agatha, she doesn’t want to overlook a single thing. </p><p> </p><p>And then she kisses Agatha. Her eyes slip shut, and she’s sure Agatha’s do, too. The kisses are short and chaste, moreso meant for saying things words can’t fully capture. Rio moves from Agatha’s lips to the corner of her mouth, to her cheek, her jawline. Agatha giggles as Rio continuously presses her lips to parts of Agatha’s face, grateful she’s able to do this, now.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s eyes are on Agatha’s again, she notes, “Mind blowing night.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face lights up at that. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio can’t help it. “Yeah, it was a great concert.”</p><p> </p><p>The look on Agatha’s face is not amused, and all of a sudden, Rio feels her nipple being pulled. “Ow! Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what you get for being bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pouts. But then she remembers. “Well, you’re dating me, so.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at this. “Yes, Rio. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>A childish laugh, too giddy to claim dignity, slips out of Rio before she can stop it. “Yeah. <em> My </em> girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha yawns, a smile creeping up on her face. “Mmm.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no. My sleepy girlfriend.” Rio strategically maneuvers her leg so that she can capture the topsheet that had been pushed onto the corner of the mattress without getting up and losing the tangle of limbs she’d perfectly curated with Agatha.  It takes a hot second, but she’s able to successfully grab a hold of it and wrap the blanket around her and Agatha. Her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, girlfriend Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just snorts cutely at that and nestles her nose into the crook of Rio’s neck. Rio continues to brush her fingers across Agatha’s back, reveling in how soft Agatha’s skin is. Soon enough, Rio can hear soft snores. Agatha’s fallen asleep.</p><p> </p><p>And, as she does in many other things, Rio follows Agatha soon after.</p><p><br/>
