<h2 class="toc-heading">Broken Deal</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p> </p><p>Billy Maximoff’s body collapsed on the ground, just a corpse of the teenager he was. Full of life, curiosity, ready to develop his powers and find his brother. However, that could never be possible. The balance had to be restored, life couldn’t go on with one cheating death. </p><p> </p><p>A bed of flowers covered the ground as it closed over his body. Rio said a small goodbye, wishing him the best on his journey, knowing well his spirit would find her when he was ready to cross over. The woman wasn’t surprised how he wasn’t ready to cross. Most likely he’d be roaming each continent in desperate attempts to find his brother for centuries to come. </p><p> </p><p>Selfishly, Rio couldn’t bother to waste another second thinking about the boy. Agatha’s words entered her mind so viciously. As if they could kill her themselves. Their deal was done, it was sealed, never again would things be the same. No more chasing Agatha, teasing her, trying to make amends any chance she could. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness made it clear to her she never wanted to see her face again. Rio Vidal, Death herself, was always one to hold true to her deals she made. Never one to break her promise. The pair were both so stubborn in their own ways. Rio swore it was a curse in itself they had to be that way. If only one could let loose, maybe the other would follow suit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, closing her eyes. She brought back the form of Rio Vidal, shedding Lady Death’s appearance. The skull was no longer visible. A hidden identity till your time had come. Only Agatha knew her true form’s appearance. Something she once begged to see so long ago.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Just a few seconds, please”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Why would you want to see such a thing?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“What are you so fearful of?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rio sighed, looking down to the ground with a subtle pout. Agatha lifted her chin with her thumb and pointer finger, letting their eyes lock together. She read the worry in Rio’s eyes. How they silently pleaded to be understood. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“My love..” Agatha whispered. “I love you in any shape or form. A little bit of Death doesn’t scare me. If such a thing could, why would I ever have made you my very own?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She watched the worrisome eyes lighten up a hint. As Agatha kept a hold of her chin, slowly the facade of Rio Vidal faded away. The skeleton became visible. Bones so sharp her jawline could slice Agatha’s skin. She kept her eyes locked into the brown ones now roaming all over. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Breathtaking..” Agatha murmured.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio felt all of her worries fade away. Agatha wouldn’t be able to see how flustered she had become, but she held power over Lady Death unlike any other. She studied how Agatha’s amazement turned into something different. The familiar slow wave of desire and lust taking a hold. She could only scoff, shaking her head. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“There’s no way you-”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha broke down into a sweet laugh at the sound of her voice. For a split moment, Rio had slipped back into the pit of anxiety she was just in. However, the witch was a step ahead of her, ready to settle those concerns as quick as they arose.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“That voice of yours..” She smirked. “Only adds to it”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rio shook her head. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“You’re unbelievable..”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman craned her neck side to side before stepping back, wondering how she’d continue on without the witch her black heart beated for. Only time would tell. There was no choice for her but to carry on. Her job being Death doomed her to exist till the end of time, even beyond that. </p><p> </p><p>However, when she turned around, the overwhelming thoughts abruptly stopped. Her feet followed suit, eyes widening at the sight behind her. </p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em>?</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed the nerves, strong to hold them back and not let her hopes rise only to crush her over again. Rio didn’t think through her next words. An abrupt question laced with frustration entered the space between them. </p><p> </p><p>“What happened to never wanting to see my face again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, scoffing (A fake scoff, Rio noted) with the gesture. </p><p> </p><p>“You must've trapped me here somehow, I can't leave” </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes narrowing to see past the weak facade Agatha was wearing. She had to restrain a smirk over the pathetic lie. </p><p> </p><p>Why was Agatha even attempting it? That question was easy to answer for her. The witch never knew how to approach her emotions directly. Always different paths around it, jokes and excuses. Centuries and there was never a moment of her taking a direct approach. </p><p> </p><p>“You got me,” Rio said, playing into the lie. “I'm surprised it worked. After all, you have your purple back and yet…you aren't fighting against it” </p><p> </p><p>She slowly started to step closer, keeping her stared locked on her, almost threatening in a way. Rio didn’t have to waste energy over figuring out what was going through Agatha. It was clear in the way Agatha picked the skin off her fingertips, teetering on her feet, how her eyes looked fearful as can be. She was nothing but a wreck of nerves, piles of anxiety, worries piled onto one another. More and more the closer Rio was to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why is that, Agatha?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio watched as the question pushed Agatha into an even more vulnerable space. The weak mask she had worn dissolved completely. She simply became the sensitive, nervous, small version of Agatha Harkness only Rio Vidal knew existed. </p><p> </p><p>“We both know your powers are stronger than mine” </p><p> </p><p>She smirked, loving how Agatha wasn’t offering any response of sorts. As evil and selfish as it would sound, Rio had her exactly where she wanted her. Access to such an incredibly delicate side. One that brought such softness to the world. Sometimes she wished Agatha would show this side of her more often. Then again, Rio was shamelessly selfish. She’d kill anyone who dared to find this version existed. Soft, vulnerable, adorable, Agatha Harkness was for her eyes only. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” Rio said in a lower voice. “Do you still want me to let you go?” </p><p> </p><p>The question following her appearance wasn’t surprising. After all, it was only a few hours prior Agatha told Rio to leave her alone when this deal was done. She should be miles away by now. The distance was supposed to be between them till the day Agatha died. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt herself succumbing to a massive amount of anxiety that was hard to comprehend. Unlike anything she had ever faced before. Her usual wit and quick responses ceased to exist. She was silent, speechless, unable to think of an explanation. </p><p> </p><p>“You know I'm not holding you back” Rio said, barely above a whisper. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, defeated as Rio unsurprisingly caught her lie. There had been no attempt to hide it. They both knew the words meant nothing but a load of bullshit. Following her sigh, she nodded before looking down at the ground, hearing Rio’s snicker from above. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn't even think of doing that actually,” Rio said. “You should've given me that idea earlier” </p><p> </p><p>The witch shrugged, glancing back up with a low,</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I am full of good ideas,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, thankful the egotistical woman was still piled under the nerves. Normally she would argue her words to annoy her. A little fun back and forth. But, Rio was too busy picking apart the nerves that were taking a hold of the woman she loved most. Something about it wasn’t simple. She knew it wasn’t just being hypocritical to the deal she had asked for, more demanded. Rio pulled her lips back, eyes narrowing as she tried to pinpoint what the truth was. </p><p> </p><p>It couldn’t have been their fight. That was always borderline foreplay for them. She knew well Agatha thrived off it even more than she did. </p><p> </p><p>Nothing about her powers. Agatha had her purple back just as she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Billy? Sure, Agatha was upset, but she wouldn’t-</p><p> </p><p><em>Maximoff</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had clicked it when she thought of his last name. Not wasting a second to ask a low,</p><p> </p><p>“He got into your head, didn't he?” </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha was quick to ask. </p><p> </p><p>“We both know he was a copy of his mother,” Rio pointed out. “You’re no longer hiding behind the Darkhold. The wall is down. He was able to sneak his way in” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped from how her eyes stung. In sync with her tears, her bottom lip started to quiver. Rio knew that look better than she knew anything else. A lifetime of studying every subject and object there was, knowing the ways of the universe and how to keep it at a delicate balance, Life and death, everything this world had to offer. She’d always be the most knowledgeable when it came to-</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped as she looked away, bringing the back of her hand up to press against her lips. The reaction only confirmed what she knew already. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>The little shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>How could that annoying boy do something so cruel? Anyone knew the mention of Agatha’s son was something to never be said. Even the witches that hated her most didn’t dare to reach so low. They’d only ever keep the words in hushed whispers behind her back, ancient stories around the campfire, rumors that spread through covens for centuries. As nasty as they all were, it was never to Agatha’s face, let alone in her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio instantly regretted letting his death be so peaceful after learning this had happened. She should’ve known. The way Agatha had paused, how her eyes looked dull. All of the signs were there, but her focus was solely on her job. The woman would hate herself for it all later. </p><p> </p><p>There was no time to dwell over how she had been blind. Her focus was solely on taking care of the mess in front of her. No matter what Agatha wanted, she wasn’t going to hold back. Not a chance in hell she would be able to do so.  </p><p> </p><p>She was quick to take a few steps to close the distance between them. Her hands were careful as she cupped either side of the woman's face, gently tilting her head back up to lock their eyes together. Rio waited for Agatha to push her to the ground, yell at her for taking Nicky so long ago and to never touch her again. Though to her surprise and relief, Agatha didn’t make an attempt to do so. </p><p> </p><p>“That's why you stormed off the way you did, isn't it?” She whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyelids shut, trying to hold back the tears that were fighting against her. She only offered the tiniest nod. One that’d be barely visible to the naked eye. </p><p> </p><p>“I had a feeling..” Rio said, her thumbs started to wipe the tears coating her cheeks. “I'll be honest when I say, I thought it was because of me. I know it still partially is, but…it's-”</p><p> </p><p>“It wasn't,” Agatha shook her head. She opened her eyes, striking pain through Rio’s heart over how broken she looked. “It uh..when he said his name,” She took in a sharp breath, eyes filled with remorse. “You didn't want to do it, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was frozen for a moment. There was never a chance she’d expect such a thing. Not just being able to touch her, keep her close, be the one she opened this side of her to once again. More so it was how Agatha never had asked her this question. </p><p> </p><p>It had always been the same pattern of assumptions and accusations for centuries. Never caring to give Rio a chance to voice her opinions and explanations.  </p><p> </p><p>“My love..” </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t even registered the name she chose to use. Only a second after the two words rolled off her tongue did she wait for Agatha to say the haunting word she hated so much,</p><p> </p><p><em>Don't</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, Agatha didn’t make a sound. She kept her eyes locked with her own, pleading for a response to most likely the most important question that would be between them. Rio knew this was her chance. The other woman wasn’t shutting her down, arguing with her, storming away and hiding anywhere she could. This time was vastly different than all the rest. She couldn’t take a chance on missing it. </p><p> </p><p>“I've never felt such deep sorrow when I picked him up that night,” Rio whispered. “I always knew that night would come, but I dreaded it in ways I'll never be able to explain” </p><p> </p><p>Rio had to take a pause to let the words come to her. It had been centuries since she ever bothered to think over what she would say. She had given up hope forever ago she’d have a chance to do so. </p><p> </p><p>“It wasn't just feeling endless guilt he wouldn't grow up, he wouldn't have a family of his own, his powers would never develop..” She took in a quick inhale before continuing. “I knew your heart was going to be ripped to pieces. Your soul is now shattered because of me” </p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t fathom the emotions running through her. It was all such a mess. From living the memory of taking Nicholas that night, trying to wrap her brain around being able to touch Agatha like this again, it was all too much. </p><p> </p><p>“I'll spend eternity with that regret. I'll never forgive myself” </p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s voice cracked, tears of her own broke out, rolling down her cheeks just as Agatha’s were. The green and black clouds above started to slow down. The loud cracks of thunder faded away. A sign Rio’s strength was dissolving into nothing. She was weak. Only Agatha Harkness was ever able to bring Rio Vidal, Lady Death, down to such a level. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly realized how she had spent so long wrapped up in her own grief, too blind to see the other side. The other half of Nicholas who had to strip him from his life on earth. She may have been the one to have given birth, the one to change his diapers and help him learn how to walk. </p><p> </p><p>None of it changed how the other half of him was Rio Vidal. No one else. He inherited the woman’s nose and smile, the mannerisms belonged to her, even his laugh was a copy of Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew as well late at night when she was asleep, Rio would appear to take him on nature walks, teach him everything he needed to know about the environment to the stars in the sky. She had caught on when he was about four years old. He had picked an Azalea flower, gifting it to her with endless pride written all over him.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Oh my favorite! You know me so well”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Mother told me it was”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Nicholas had skipped away right after. She remembered the moment like it was yesterday. He knew Rio even before she had to take him. Never in his life on earth did he get to experience his mother’s together, but he got to experience both separately. </p><p> </p><p>“I'm so-”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry” Agatha cut her off. “I'm so, so, sorry” She whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Rio's wall that was built strong and high had shattered. Broken with such a strong force, stronger than their magic combined. There was a final gasp before a sob shook her entire being. Her body fell forward into the woman’s front. Agatha's arms moved quickly to wrap around her waist. She winced when Rio’s body went limp, her knees giving out, threatening to collapse right then and there. Agatha wouldn’t let her. </p><p> </p><p>She made sure to hold her up with one arm wrapped around her waist, hand grasping her hip. The other reached up so her fingers could tangle through her hair, whispering small apologies against her skull. </p><p> </p><p>After centuries of pain, anger, guilt and regrets they had found the door into forgiveness. Even if it wouldn’t be an easy thing to do, they wouldn’t fix everything overnight- Rio had finally had her lifelong wish granted. </p><p> </p><p>However, at the same time, Nicky was on Rio’s mind more than ever. His small laugh, beautiful smile, the way he spoke endlessly about Agatha as if she ruled the universe. It was true how she was able to see him from time to time. That was one of the main reasons she was in the wrong according to Agatha. But, it wasn’t something that made her happy. </p><p> </p><p>She’d much rather have seen their little boy become a man before their very eyes. Some say they wish their child would stay young forever, Rio had always wished the opposite. </p><p> </p><p>The woman whimpered when Agatha pulled her head away, her hold tightening in fear she'd let go. The witch simply shushed her, thumbs wiping away the tears rolling down as if they were racing one another. Rio was too lost in her emotions to register the lingering gaze the other woman had. One she’d typically notice and instantly poke fun over. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t until Agatha's thumb traced over her bottom lip did Rio snap out of it. The subtle touch made her jump, eyes looking up to finally see where Agatha’s mind had slipped to. She couldn't refrain from parting her lips, hoping and waiting for her to read what she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, Agatha knew. She caught on the moment Rio crawled out of the ground. Hell, before they entered this “road” when the dagger was held against her chest. </p><p> </p><p>The only reason she held back was out of fear and resentment. If you asked her when Rio kicked down the door they’d be here, she would’ve laughed in your face. The wicked witch would have tossed you across the room, inflicting as much pain as she possibly could to make sure you never mentioned the idea again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t waste a second to slip the tip of her thumb between her teeth. In sync, a silent moan of relief escaped them both when she gently bit down. The embrace lingered for a second or so before the witch escaped the bite, dragging Rio’s bottom lip down with her thumb. No words needed to be said. There were exactly four seconds before Agatha leaned in, crashing her lips against the other pair that anxiously had been awaiting her own. </p><p> </p><p>The kiss wasn't gentle. How could it be? After centuries of angst, longing, deep pits of desiring one another all while never finding their way back. Their teeth bumped against one another, tongues didn’t waste a second to touch one another for the first time in so long. The salty taste of tears slipped between their lips, bringing out even stronger emotions when it melted on their taste buds. Pleads, apologies, professing love over and over. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was holding her tighter. Cursing how she couldn’t physically open herself up, pull the woman into her, forcing them to become one. Rio kept one hand tangled in Agatha’s mess of hair, the other slipped down to hold her wrist with a tight grasp, making sure she wouldn’t go anywhere. Not that she ever would. </p><p> </p><p>The sky completely cleared above them. Sun shining, blue skies returning as if they never left. Birds began singing in joy over the reunion. Even as the environment around them became bright and filled with life, they were oblivious. To the two, nothing else existed besides each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn't covenless no more. Rio wasn’t solely Lady Death collecting souls, spending a life of lonesome. They were a team. A strong duo. The infamous witch killer alongside Death was a force to be reckoned with. </p><p> </p><p>Neither knew how long it had been before they pulled away. Their foreheads stayed pressed against one another. As Agatha was gasping for air, Rio didn't bother to catch her breath, whispering a small, </p><p> </p><p>“Please don't leave” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes to find the brown orbs awaiting her gaze. They were still soaked with tears, widened with a strong plea. She hated seeing the fear stricken in them. Especially knowing she had been the one to place the emotion there. </p><p> </p><p>“You'll never get away from me,” Agatha assured, a tiny smirk grew on her lips. “It'll make you sick how strong of a hold I'll have on you” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was shocked over how there was no stuttering, no prolonged hesitation. Rio must’ve had the same surprised thoughts herself. It was amusing and a relief to watch the realization wash over her eyes. They went from terror, shock, a deep pit of nerves into something more. </p><p> </p><p><em>Hope</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Bold words,” She whispered, tilting her head back to push the woman's hair out of her face. “That means I’ll get to keep you even after you die” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh honey, that's a long time from now,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked even wider as Rio rolled her eyes. The words echoed the familiar banter all these years. No longer would it be covered in coldness, vicious intent. It was simply their sarcasm, wit. Humor and warmth would be the only tone to those words the years ahead of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Still,” Rio shrugged. “We have eternity” </p><p> </p><p>“Damned to be together” Agatha smiled.  </p><p> </p><p>The words brought out a laugh. It was a small inside joke between them. Any moment they ran into one another, Agatha would say it in an annoyed, upset, manner. While Rio would be beaming with enthusiasm, finding her annoyance humorous as she said it. </p><p> </p><p>“I've missed you, my love” Rio whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm,” Agatha hummed. “I guess I missed you” </p><p> </p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes as she paused, followed by a small snicker.</p><p> </p><p>“That kiss did not feel like a guess, but whatever you say, Agatha” </p><p> </p><p>A deep red shade formed on the witch's cheeks, running down her neck, from head to toe. </p><p> </p><p><em>The Agatha Harkness</em> was blushing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio would never get used to the pride that ran through her over it. How she was the only one to bring out such a strong color to her skin. No one else would believe such a sight could exist. </p><p> </p><p>“A little rusty, but..we can work on that” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, sending Rio into a fit of small giggles. The woman made a weak attempt to pull away as if she was truly offended. Rio was quick to pull her back, holding her against her with no chance of a release. </p><p> </p><p>“Bold words,” Agatha echoed the words from before. </p><p> </p><p>Rio beamed as she took her turn to lean in. Unlike Agatha’s, her kiss was gentle as can be. Pure softness and so tender, treating her lover like a delicate piece of fabric that would tear apart over the faintest touch. </p><p> </p><p>“Honey,” Agatha whispered against her lips.  </p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” </p><p> </p><p>“Can we get the fuck out of this shit hole?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled into the kiss, nodding at the question she was waiting for. </p><p> </p><p>Before pulling away, the woman pecked her lips once again. It was official how she would be unable to hold herself back. She hadn’t even taken ten minutes to relapse all over again. Agatha Harkness would always be her drug. Overdosing over the touch of Agatha sounded beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was a perk Death would never be able to die. The woman had free reign to self medicate from her drug. </p><p> </p><p>“Where do you want to go?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, seemingly nervous at the location she was thinking of. Rio knew by the way she held her breath, her eyes looking down between them while the words barely audible escaped from her.</p><p> </p><p>“Our home..is it st-”</p><p> </p><p>“A little abandoned, I'd say. I don't go there often, but..” Rio said. “It’s still standing. Waiting for us” </p><p> </p><p>The witch looked up at her, relief shining bright like a beacon. The day had finally come and she’d take years to comprehend it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to go home. Not just any home, their home. The small cottage tucked far into the woods. Unable to be found unless you were the pair that lived there. </p><p> </p><p>No longer would Rio visit it to see it standing alone, deteriorating ever so slowly. When she’d go back, Agatha would be somewhere on the property. She already felt giddy over the idea of it and they hadn’t even gone back yet. </p><p> </p><p>How would she survive them physically being there if her imagination was running this wild?</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha said, pulling back to drag the woman with her. “Guess we shouldn't make it wait any longer” </p><p> </p><p>— </p><p> </p><p>A few hours later they had found themselves stumbling through the woods. Agatha trailing behind with small grumbles over how the hem of her purple dress was getting dirt on it. Rio could only laugh over the familiar sight. </p><p> </p><p>“Think you'd lear-”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't plan this, you know?” Agatha was quick to argue, a tiny bit of attitude in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Don't get snippy with me” Rio threw over her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbled again, shaking her head as she muttered how stupid it was. </p><p> </p><p>“You realize we can wash it-”</p><p> </p><p>“I just got it back” She nearly whined. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes with a wide smile. It would always be adorable to her how dramatic Agatha could be. Her little pouts only she ever would be a witness to. How she’d lose her mind over something so small. </p><p> </p><p>Sure, it may annoy others. But to Rio, Agatha was her mad woman to manage and put up with. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, you won't even be wearing it in the next half an hour, if that” </p><p> </p><p>The woman's head snapped up, meeting her amused stare. Rio grinned madly at the instant red all over her face, wiggling her eyebrows slightly. Again, she had succeeded in bringing out the deep blushing version of her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t offer a verbal response. She picked up her dress with more aggression, stomping away to lead the way instead of Rio. Not acknowledging the way Rio snickered from behind. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't long until the familiar cottage was before them. Agatha’s complaining had stopped, Rio’s cocky smile fell into disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the home was worn down. </p><p>The wood would need attention, the roof panels needed to be restored as some were laying on the ground. Agatha noticed how two of the window's glass had shattered. </p><p> </p><p>The small cottage had officially become a fixer upper. It would lead to the ultimate test on how well they would be working together again. Neither wanted to think about that right then and there.</p><p> </p><p>It went unspoken for Agatha to take the lead. Leaving the other woman to watch as the witch took a confident approach to the front porch, head held high, hands still holding the dress up. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was only able to smile as she admired the sight. A small countdown in her mind had kicked off. Waiting for Agatha to wave her hand to the garden that sprawled across the front lawn, tossing over her shoulder a strong,</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll have to fix this mess” </p><p> </p><p><em>Predictable</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes ma'am,” Rio answered. </p><p> </p><p>The front door wouldn't open no matter how hard Agatha pulled on it. After a few attempts she tossed her head back, muttered curse words before more complaints spilled her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop complaining,” She pushed her aside. “It’s already tiresome hearing it”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, putting her hands up as she stepped aside. </p><p> </p><p>“Tiresome,” The witch muttered under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>With a sway of her hand, Rio pulled the strong gust of wind toward them, flicking her wrist to unlock the door. The door flew off the hinges with the strong pull. Rio jumped out of the way in the nick of time, watching as the door flew into the yard. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had let out a strong laugh the moment she had caught Rio, but it only increased at the sight of the door far from its assigned spot. </p><p> </p><p>“Is knocking down doors your new thing?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio stood up taller, catching her breath as she looked over to Agatha. At first, she was confused by the amused question. Until she had thought of, </p><p> </p><p><em>Westview</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha had woken up from the spell Wanda had put her under, Rio couldn’t control how eager she was to see her. The door was kicked in with a strong kick of wind. Now this door had been pulled with a strong gust of wind. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha was right, she must’ve had a new thing for removing doors. </p><p> </p><p>“What can I say?” Rio adjusted her clothes, straightening her back with a shrug. “I’m just excited to see you” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. This time, she was the one to roll her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>She leaned over to kiss the side of Rio’s head, her hand gave a light tap on her rear before completely pulling away. If Death herself was able to blush, she’d be the color of cherry red twenty four seven. Especially with little moments like so.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped into the house first, Rio tagging alongside her. Neither were able to make out the exact emotion. Everything was combined from nerves to relief. For centuries, the witches had craved the cottage. Agatha spent everyday homesick over it. Rio longed for the cottage to not be empty.</p><p> </p><p>No longer stuck in a trance or dream, they were actually home together once again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio placed the side of her face against Agatha's shoulder, unable to keep her hands off of her. Attached like a magnet, stuck like glue. From this moment on, Rio would always be touching Agatha even if it was just a graze of her fingertips. As if Death herself would pass away without her touch. </p><p> </p><p>“Definitely have a lot of cleaning up to do” Agatha sighed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed. </p><p> </p><p>The woman left a kiss on her shoulder before walking away. Her cloak was discarded onto the back of the couch. The crown tossed on the cushions below it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched the woman closely. A tiny bit of amusement ran through her. The memories of their bickering the cloak and crown would lead them to. How she'd nag Rio over not hanging the piece of wardrobe, the careless placement for her crown.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Are you trying to break it?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“I can just fix it up or get a new one Ag,”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Plus your cloak, just hang it up! It doesn’t even take two seconds”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Happy wife, happy life..”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“What was that?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair, saying a low,</p><p> </p><p>“I'll get the generator going” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped out of her trance. She shook her head, furrowing her eyebrows, confusion written all over her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Since when is there any sort of power here?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder. An entertained smile grew on her lips. She always loved being the one to take Agatha by surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“I had to stay here sometimes,” Rio shrugged. “Even death needs a movie or two to watch” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scanned her around the living room, only then noticing the TV above the mantle. the new lamps that scattered around the house. A little chuckle followed when she noticed the playstation. Of course, Rio found a love for video games. Most likely the shooting ones that would annoy her, she guessed. </p><p> </p><p>The back door creaked when it opened, bounced against the frame a few times before it shut. The sound alone sent shivers down her spine over how familiar it was. As if she had heard it only minutes ago. When in reality, it had been centuries. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hung up the purple cloak on the coat tree, grabbing Rio’s to hang it up right after. She moved the crown to the end table. Only then did she pause, smiling softly to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t given a second thought to her actions. They had felt more familiar than getting her powers back. There was no adjustment, no energy to waste or rebuild. It was simply her life. </p><p> </p><p><em>I'm home</em>. </p><p> </p><p>She started to move throughout the familiar small cottage. The one built out of love, magic, materials they made themselves. It was tiny. Neither wanted a big space. Rio would joke she craved it to be as small as possible to drive Agatha crazy with how close they were. The witch would always fake being suffocated, but both knew she absolutely adored it. </p><p> </p><p>The kitchen was the first room she passed by, seeing Rio pass by the back door as she worked on kicking the power on. Agatha placed a hand over her heart with a content sigh. </p><p> </p><p>There was comfort in the familiar sight. Rio was always the one around the house doing work. She was the one to keep the cottage standing while Agatha would be the one to either make delicious meals or drive Rio crazy with small directions on what she wanted done. They were the classic domestic relationship others wouldn’t expect from a witch killer and Death. </p><p> </p><p>After basking in the moment, she made her way down the narrow hallway. The bathroom being on the left, the small library Agatha had built for Rio on the right. A small desk against the window, bookshelves covering each wall. Each little detail only brought a smile to her more and more until-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped in her tracks, her hand pressing on her chest harder. </p><p> </p><p><em>Nicky</em>..</p><p> </p><p>The door had remained shut for god knows how long. She knew Rio had built the nursery for when he would enter this world. It never happened. The moment Agatha was given time with Nicholas, she took him and ran away. The theory Rio could never take him if they were never found stayed strong. Even if she knew truly that was an impossible thought destined to fail. </p><p> </p><p>Not now. She could not focus on the little boy her heart ached over at that moment. If she did, all the courage and work to be in this cottage with Rio would slip away from her. </p><p> </p><p><em>Stay present. Don’t ruin this</em>. </p><p> </p><p>It took everything in her to walk to the end of the hallway, not allowing herself to hesitate from opening the one door that would truly bring her home. The one room in her life she had always felt safest in. Agatha stood in the doorway of their bedroom for a moment. A sigh of relief relaxed her entire body. </p><p> </p><p><em>Home</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Multiple memories had been coursing through her. However, the warmest memory flooding her mind were late nights when Rio would return home. How she’d scurry to crawl under the covers. Sometimes she wouldn’t bother to shed her clothes. Which would only result in Agatha nagging her in the morning over it. </p><p> </p><p>“Death’s clothes in bed. That alone sounds horrible, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t have complaints when Death was fucking you in Death’s clothing in bed last night”</p><p> </p><p>“....No more Death’s clothes in bed, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>“Happy wife, happy-”</p><p> </p><p>“And knock it off with that saying!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled at the memory as her eyes scanned the room frozen in time. The bed unmade, bookshelves on either side, the clothes still had their clothes hung up. It was all so overwhelming to her. </p><p> </p><p>She never imagined she’d be back here, let alone after a day they had. Just hours prior Agatha was convinced Rio’s extreme jealousy would kill her. Not even the deal Agatha demanded would be the reason.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her arms out of the sleeves, the bra remaining tight on her chest. She tossed the long sleeve onto the floor, going to take the skirt off when a pair of hands placed over her own. </p><p> </p><p>A gasp escaped her lips with a small jump. She felt the lips brushed against her ear with a low,</p><p> </p><p>“Not going to let me have the fun?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha processed the question before a soft chuckle left her lips. </p><p> </p><p>“If I let you, it'll be ripped to shreds” </p><p> </p><p>The woman behind didn’t waste a second to push the bottom half down, letting it fall to the floor around her ankles. </p><p> </p><p>“I swear, you'll always love this dress more than me” She murmured, dipping her head to trail soft kisses along the back of her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it is beautiful” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, leaning back, letting herself fully relax for the first time in centuries. Rio’s lips were so soft. She could nearly cry over how delicate the woman treated her. When everyone else in this world was strong, tough, ready to fight her at any given moment- Rio never was. </p><p> </p><p>Even if they were throwing each other into walls, using the woman’s dagger to pierce each other’s skin, it was still with love. Their foreplay, Agatha, once named it.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, on the bed” Rio instructed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, not even bothering with an argument. </p><p> </p><p>When she collapsed on the bed with a deep sigh, she was quick to realize the sheets were fresh. The smell of Rio completely swallowed her whole. How the bed wasn’t abandoned like the rest of the house. Slowly Agatha pieced it together. If there was a generator, the dust wasn’t as strong to hit her nose, the bedsheets weren’t old-</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been here recently, haven’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved to sit on the edge of the mattress, perking up when she saw Rio taking her dress off. </p><p> </p><p>“I left that bullshit of a road the other night to be here,” Rio admitted, tossing her head over her shoulder. “Needed uh…a reminder we weren't always against one another” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha somewhat hated Rio having to do so. While she loved how fresh the bed was thanks to Rio being there a few days prior. Plus a generator was incredible to her. As stuck in the Salem days she was most of the time, the new electricity this century brought was a blessing. </p><p> </p><p>However, she hated the reasoning. </p><p> </p><p>The witch knew how cruel she had been to her all these years. It would be one of her lifelong regrets. Even if the pain was fresh, forgiveness would be challenging, Agatha had caused deep agony for the woman she loved most. She was aware of it. Now more than ever. </p><p> </p><p>She watched her closely, waiting until Rio had glanced over to see the way she curled her pointer finger in the air, gesturing for her to come closer. A devilish smirk grew on Rio’s lips, quickly scuttering over, slotting herself between her legs. </p><p> </p><p>Only the frame of her top was off. The tube top around her abdomen, long flowing black skirt still wrapped around her waist. Agatha’s fingers trailed up down her sides before slipping the top up, letting her hands roam underneath. Her eyes perked as a grin appeared, the low whisper of the question sent chills down Rio’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>“You still don't like bras, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't get to answer. Agatha’s palms were quick to grasp her breasts, bringing the woman already a crazy amount of pleasure. Simply from her hands touching the cold skin had a powerful impact. After so long, Agatha was touching her in the way she desired most. Even if their fighting was all fun and games, this was different. </p><p> </p><p>After a strong gasp, Rio went to say something sarcastic, but Agatha must've sensed it. A step ahead of her, as always. She silenced her by letting her thumbs drag across her nipples, gently applying a light amount of pressure. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn't surprised by the little whimper that crawled out of her throat, escaping past her lips. Though she felt a tad bit of frustration over Agatha’s raspy chuckle. Especially knowing she wouldn’t hear the end of it later on. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re insufferable,” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you seem to think so..” She said, pushing the top up more. “Arms up, I want this off of you” </p><p> </p><p>The woman was quick to follow the instruction. Once the top landed on the floor and Agatha’s hands returned to her skin- Rio’s eyes flew open to see this was real. Her stomach fluttered as she watched the woman lean forward, her lips pressing a kiss in the middle of her chest. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t even notice how staggered her breathing sounded. Rio’s mind was going easily over a hundred miles per hour, if not more. Her stomach ached with butterflies swirling around. She felt the way her black heart started to beat at a rapid pace. Chills ran down her spine, knees already becoming weak. </p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em>. <em>Agatha. Agatha.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Did you imagine this?” Agatha whispered against her skin, eyes glancing up to meet her own. </p><p> </p><p>The woman left another kiss before leaning back, never breaking eye contact as she brought another finger beside her thumb, rolling the small nubs on either side. Rio arched her back when a strong lightning bolt struck her core. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had a fleeing thought of amusement. Truly, she thought Agatha would be the one to cave. Especially with how vulnerable and small she had been since the moment she was waiting for her. It shouldn’t have been a surprise to her that Agatha was taking control. There were no complaints on her end over that. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took her right hand away, quickly moving it up before Rio could even register. The rough grasp on the back of her neck bringing her a bit closer with a low,</p><p> </p><p>“Answer me” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes” Rio didn't waste a second to reply. </p><p> </p><p>The witch smirked, a hum filled with content followed.</p><p> </p><p>She moved her hands down to grab the skirt, tugging until it dropped to the floor. Her eyes darkened over seeing the pair of lace black underwear. An evil grin grew on her lips at the sight, taking a second to admire the beauty before her. She let her hands rub over her thighs, tisking silently as she asked,</p><p> </p><p>“Now, who are you wearing this for, hm?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed the lump in her throat. She tried keeping her demeanor strong with one last attempt at a fight (which was completely hopeless, she knew that).</p><p> </p><p>“Don't get your hopes-”</p><p> </p><p>She didn't get to complete her sentence. Agatha had gripped her hips, pulling her back down to collapse on the mattress. </p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t refrain from letting out a laugh through the lack of air that had been stolen from her. She felt her black heart swelling with contentment, a rise of excitement growing within her. </p><p> </p><p>However, her laughter didn’t last long as Agatha’s thigh pressed between her legs. It was cut off abruptly. The woman's eyes snapping open, lips parting with a low moan from the back of her throat. The witch above her was covered in a massive amount of ego. Rio didn't have to look to know that. </p><p> </p><p>Just as her hands were reaching up to hold her neck, they were pinned down. She let her eyes find the darkening ones above her. A little swallow pushing the lump of excited nerves down. </p><p> </p><p>“Someone’s missed me, hm?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was holding back from showing the true mess she was. She wanted to be the one in complete control. Let Rio not just know, but feel her remorse for everything. The woman needed Rio to be overwhelmed with the realization she was beyond loved and cared for. How she was the only one the stone cold Agatha Harkness was ever able to fall in love with. </p><p> </p><p>“Says the one who kissed me first” </p><p> </p><p>She had paused over Rio’s words, processing them for a moment. Agatha felt her stomach swirl with amusement, her chest swelling over the memories. Death herself was feared by all. A woman that held the biggest power out of all of them. The natural order of all things, after all. For sure she had to be the one always in control. </p><p> </p><p>Well, to others that was. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness knew otherwise. She was the one to break down Death herself, for herself. Something that made her feel like a goddess of sorts. </p><p> </p><p>No one in history could say the words she was able to. It’d be a lie from them, while nothing but the truth from her. Rio would come home from being the one dominating, controlling, taking the lead on everything she encountered- to being a puddle of desperation. </p><p> </p><p>As much as Agatha thrived off being the one to make love to her, fuck her, in every way possible. No, there was something more to this. This sight beneath her nearly brought tears to her eyes. Centuries and Rio still would trust her this way. Even after everything from the nasty words, physical fights, years of hiding from her behind the Darkhold. </p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal was still her very own.  </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think being a brat is in your best interest, Rio” She warned, lowering her head to whisper a low, “I hear it in your voice, you know? How all this time, you don’t only want this. You’re still nothing but mine, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>The fight to tease, the typical energy to get on Agatha's nerves, all of it dissolved within a second. There was no reason to confirm Agatha’s words. She could hear it in the woman’s voice how she already knew the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could only push her hips forward, desperate for the woman’s touch in any way possible. The movement brought out a raspy chuckle from above. Agatha nodded, muttering under her breath a low,</p><p> </p><p>“All these years..” Agatha started to leave tiny kisses along her jawline. Starting from the left, all the way to the right until she reached her earlobe to add a barely audible, “And you're still, so, so, easy” </p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a cry of desire before feeling Agatha pull her into a rough kiss. Just like hours prior in Westview, it was filled with every emotion they wanted to convey to the other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s filled with nothing but regrets. Rio was pleading for the witch to stay, make her realize every choice she had made was out of love, not hate. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” Rio whispered into the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>The witch only hummed, not wanting to stop for a moment from kissing her. Rio hesitated, but decided to not respond. She wanted to test if Agatha still knew her. Not that she needed to, she already was well aware the woman knew every aspect of her. Still, her hips thrusted up, moaning gently into the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Typically during this moment, Agatha would play with her. She’d keep asking questions, demand answers, wait till Rio was babbling endless pleas. To Rio’s relief, she was too impatient herself. </p><p> </p><p>Without breaking the kiss, her thigh moved away as her hand flew over her waist, slipping over her clit. She had to restrain from a laugh at how she felt the woman leap beneath her. If she wasn’t on top of her, holding her down, she’d most likely go flying in the air. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother to warm her up, paying no mind as her two fingers pushed their way in. The kiss broke as Rio let out a whine that would replay in the witch’s head for eternity. The sound was her favorite. It had faded over time, but it was back more than ever. Stronger, clearer, more powerful than ever before. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t let Rio adjust, knowing well the woman would be thankful for it. Both had in common being impatient. Sometimes like so, it worked in their favor. </p><p> </p><p>It was a rapid pace she had set, moving her lips down to kiss every inch of her jawline down her neck. Without thinking, her grip had let Rio’s hands free. Instantly they flew with one clawing the skin on her back, the other tangling in hair. Agatha normally loved when Rio was restrained, but she craved this. </p><p> </p><p>The witch wanted them to feel each other now and days after. Even when they’d be apart, she wanted Rio to feel the ghost of her fingers within her. Agatha would tell Rio to not heal any of the wounds she left on her. </p><p> </p><p>They needed to know their bodies would return to one another, belonged to each other. No more running, hiding, at the end of the night- they’d be in this bed wrapped in each other’s presence again.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha..” Rio gasped. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, my love?” </p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence. Agatha awaited the small plea of permission to allow her to come undone. For the waves of pleasure to crash, shake her to her core. To her surprise, it was a small,</p><p> </p><p>“Te amo”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how her body didn’t freeze right then and there. Rio speaking Spanish was always her weak spot. She adored learning every meaning, the way her voice sounded was somehow even more beautiful than it already was. It felt more special. Somehow closer to her heart. Especially the meaning behind the words. </p><p> </p><p>Rio still loved her. </p><p>She loved her. </p><p>It wasn't a figment of her imagination. This was reality. </p><p> </p><p>The woman moaned over the thought alone. Her ring finger pushed in along with the other two. Rio gasped as it took her by surprise. Her body twisted up into Agatha's. A steady stream of moans flowing from her. </p><p> </p><p>“You always feel so good,” Agatha whispered, her eyes locked below as she watched Rio’s face twist in pleasure. “So beautiful..” She added. “Can you look at me?”</p><p> </p><p>Slowly Rio opened her eyes, showing how they were glossed over and lost in a deep sense of pleasure. Agatha could only gaze in amazement. Rio in this state of mind was something else. </p><p> </p><p>However, the moment didn’t last long. Agatha felt Rio’s walls tighten around her fingers. She couldn't hold back a moan from the familiar feeling. Death herself had some of the most strength out of all of them. That played into moments like this. At times, Agatha wondered if she'd end up breaking her bones. She wouldn't even be upset by it. </p><p> </p><p>Closer and closer, Agatha watched her approach the verse of no return. She felt her body continue to rise off the bed, head dipped back with a sweet moan, cursing her name as if Rio was casting a spell herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, baby” Agatha husked. She let her thumb find the woman's clit, pressing down with slow circles just the way Rio liked. “I'm being nice to you this time. Take advantage of it” </p><p> </p><p>Rio usually would laugh over that, but she couldn't this time. Her eyes started to close again, but flew open at the sight of the strong, </p><p> </p><p>“Rio” </p><p> </p><p>She knew the meaning behind her tone. A soft demand to keep her eyes locked with Agatha's. The witch always loved watching how they rolled, darkened, tears falling from how the pleasure shook her. </p><p> </p><p>“Te amo..” Agatha whispered. </p><p> </p><p>The two words had pushed her over the ledge. With a lingering moan, eyelids closing as she struggled to fight against them. Her body thrashed, Agatha's thrusts never slowing for a moment. Everything was so much all at once. The stars in her eyes never subsided. The way her head felt heavy, heart threatening to break out of her chest. Everything was-</p><p> </p><p>“Too much,” Rio whimpered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered.
