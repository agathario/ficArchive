<div class="userstuff">
<p>Of all the places Agatha Harkness thought she would possibly be at 42 years old, pregnant, single, and looking for a roommate on Craigslist wasn’t one of them.</p><p>She was chewing on the end of her pen as her hands hovered over the keyboard, mid-way through trying to write an ad that didn’t make her sound like a complete loser, and of course, failing spectacularly.</p><p>The cursor on the screen blinked maddeningly at her, as if questioning her choice of words:</p><p>
<em>Looking for a roommate to share my 2br, 2ba Williamsburg apartment. Spacious, clean, and close to subway stations. Living with me: a woman, 40s, single, who works from home. Must be tidy and respectful of shared spaces. Not looking to make new friends, just to pay my mortgage.</em>
</p><p>It was truthful, at the very least. Short and maybe a bit curt, sure. But she didn’t want to inspire the kind of people looking to braid each other’s hair and watch rom-coms together—all she needed was a cash cow. Someone to fill the Ralph-shaped void that had been left in her mortgage account, and nothing more.</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her wild, wavy hair and leaning back in her leather chair. She looked around at her apartment—cozy, mid-century, the perfect Brooklyn gem she’d spent so long looking for—and sunk her teeth into her lower lip, absentmindedly chewing in contemplation.</p><p>She couldn’t lose this place, and this was the only solution. Moving out was not an option.</p><p>Without a second thought to the tone of the ad, or the one major detail she’d conveniently left out, Agatha hit ‘post’ and exhaled a long, slow breath. Surely Craigslist had seen worse.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>That night, exhausted but unable to sleep—as had been the theme throughout her first trimester thus far—Agatha thought of all the different versions of herself she’d been throughout her life, and what they’d think if they could see her now.</p><p>On any other night, she’d pad over to her desk and channel her restlessness into working on her novel, but something about the sheer weight of the decisions she’d been forced to make today instead saw her turn to self-loathing-fuelled reflection.</p><p>18-year-old Agatha might’ve hoped she’d be still traveling the world at 42, her body capable and her soul untethered, hiking Machu Picchu or motorbiking through Vietnam.</p><p>27-year-old Agatha would’ve hazarded a closer guess to her current reality, but still, no cigar. Back then, she’d thought her future contained a couple of kids, a nice home in the suburbs, and a handsome husband who doted on her while she went off to her big job as a professor in the city.</p><p>By 36, Agatha was convinced the next forty-plus years of her life would be spent with Ralph. Sure, he wasn’t what she’d envisioned for herself when she was younger—never comfortable with her ambitions, always reluctant to truly commit—but she’d accepted her fate, and they’d made it work.</p><p>Love was about sacrifice, she knew, and he was the closest to love she’d ever come. Maybe the closest she’d <em>ever</em> actually be able to come.</p><p>And then, when 42 finally rolled around, she’d peed on a flimsy test from CVS and instantly felt emotions completely foreign to her flood her corporeal form when the single line she was expecting was, in fact, two: pregnant.</p><p>Shifting onto her side in bed, sheets suffocating her all of a sudden, Agatha grazed a single hand over the curve of her belly. Not quite showing yet, but not as flat as it used to be, either. The only sign that she wouldn’t be completely alone in the world forever.</p><p>Now, this kid was all she had. No partner to speak of—no, Ralph had up and left within weeks of finding out she was pregnant, emboldened by the fact they had been together seven years but never actually gotten married.</p><p>Of course, that hadn’t been for lack of trying on Agatha’s part. In hindsight, she saw it for what it was. An easy out.</p><p>He’d fucked off with no sense of obligation to his kid, clearly no sentimentality about impending fatherhood, and, Agatha was certain, a woman waiting for him somewhere behind the scenes.</p><p><em> Probably your secretary or your personal trainer</em>, she’d hissed into his face at the time, an accusation he hadn’t straight-up denied. She was sure she’d see a photo of him with an arm slung around some college girl soon enough.</p><p>Their seven-year relationship had ended in the blink of an eye. On one single day three weeks ago, Ralph had shuffled boxes of his things out of their apartment while Agatha watched on coolly from the couch in between bouts of violent morning sickness, which Ralph had shown no care or concern for.</p><p>So, she was here. An emotionally wrung-out, soon-to-be single mom in her 40s who had to resort to getting a roommate to pay her bills. Fucking pathetic.</p><p>She sighed, trying to put all the past Agathas and their unbearable disappointment out of her mind. <em>This is your reality</em>, she thought, before promptly pulling a pillow over her face and directing every ounce of energy left in her body towards willing herself to sleep.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Agatha woke the next morning feeling as fresh as one could after only a handful of hours of tossing and turning. She was face-down on the pillow when a ding startled her into alertness.</p><p>Opening one bleary eye, she reached over to find the offending object—her phone—nestled between the bedsheets, battery percentage long turned red. <em>Craigslist, 1 new notification</em>, it read.</p><p>She felt around on the bedside table next to her for her glasses, slipping them onto her face impatiently, and opened up the notification.</p><p>
<em>Hey! I read your ad and I’m really interested in looking at the place. Could I come by today?</em>
</p><p>No more details were given; no backstory or photo of this person who had as much chance of being a serial killer as they did a normal human being. Just a name: Rio V.</p><p>Agatha flipped onto her back, propping up the pillows behind her as she stared down at her phone. She’d be insane to let this person—fuck, she didn’t even know if they were a man or a woman—into her home, even just to have a quick poke around. Wouldn’t she?</p><p>On one hand, she was a pregnant 42-year-old who hadn’t been to the gym in months and had very little chance of being able to fend off an axe-wielding crazy person.</p><p>But on the other hand… well, she needed the cash. Stat.</p><p>Twirling a lock of hair in her fingers as she was wont to do when anxious, Agatha’s fingers tapped over the keyboard.</p><p><em>Hi. When can you come? I’m free after noon</em>, she wrote gingerly, hitting ‘reply’ before her better judgement had the chance to catch up with her.</p><p>A response came instantly. <em>Make it 12.30 then. Send me your address! </em>💚</p><p><em>What the fuck kind of weirdo sends a heart emoji to someone they don’t even know?</em> Agatha wondered, bewildered. At least one of her questions was tentatively answered. Must be a woman—one less thing to worry about, she supposed.</p><p>She glanced at the time on her phone: 8.30am. More than enough time to shower, clean up the loose papers and tea cups that were currently scattered on every surface throughout the house, and find something to wear that gave a better impression than spaghetti-stained sweatpants.</p><p><em>12.30 it is</em>, she typed back, relaying her address before adding, <em>Oh, and please don’t be a serial killer. I don’t feel like explaining a bloody murder scene to the HOA</em>.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After what felt like only minutes had passed, Agatha’s home—all 1,200 square feet of it—was clean from top to bottom. The papers had been stuffed into a drawer, the various mugs washed and gleaming on the drying rack in the kitchen, and all signs of her month-long depression rot had been swept and mopped and polished away. She’d even put on a bit of makeup for the first time since Ralph had left, and swept her hair back into a tidy, albeit lazy, ponytail.</p><p>The buzz of the intercom broke Agatha out of her post-cleaning reverie. She startled, before glancing at her watch and noticing the time: 12.29pm.</p><p>Well, at least her serial killer was punctual.</p><p>Straightening her blouse and her posture, she strode over to the intercom and answered it.</p><p>“Hello?” she said cautiously, not sure of what to expect on the other end.</p><p>The voice that came through was bright, and confirming her suspicions, decidedly female. “Hey, it’s Rio, I’m here to see the apartment.”</p><p>Agatha steeled herself. As long as this woman wasn’t a total nutjob, she needed to make the right impression, which meant firmly exerting her boundaries from the get-go. It was important this Rio didn’t get the wrong idea; all Agatha needed was a clean, respectful person to share her space with so she could get back on her feet and pay her damn bills.</p><p>Oh, and someone that wasn’t going to totally upend her life when she eventually popped out a kid—although if she had anything to say about it, they wouldn’t be staying that long.</p><p>“I’ll let you up. Level six, fourth door on the right,” she said, hanging up the phone.</p><p>A few seconds later, there was a knock on the door. Turning the door handle, she braced herself to come face-to-face with some Craigslist creep, perhaps someone wielding a weapon ready to deliver her to certain death—but that never came.</p><p>The woman standing before her was, undeniably, a fucking knockout. If Agatha were gay, and 10 years younger, she feared this would be her type. Dark hair, warm, brown eyes, and a body that was all long limbs and obvious muscle.</p><p>She was wearing wide-legged black pants held up by a belt with a sparkling silver buckle, and a ribbed black tank top that left little to the imagination, exposing a smattering of patchwork tattoos down one arm. That hand was holding the strap of a black messenger bag slung over her shoulder, and in the other was… flowers?</p><p>Okay, that was a curveball.</p><p>The other woman clearly registered Agatha’s confused expression, because it was mere milliseconds before she was thrusting them towards her with a lopsided smile.</p><p>“They’re azaleas,” the woman—Rio—supplied, gazing down at the cluster of purple and white that Agatha was now gripping onto for dear life. “I, uh, work at a nursery. Plants, not kids. They symbolise new beginnings, if you’re into that kinda stuff.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened at the sincerity of the gesture, eking out a tight-lipped smile that was probably more like a grimace. “Thank you,” she managed.</p><p>She turned quickly on her heel and placed the bouquet on the kitchen island behind her—she’d figure out a vase and some water later. Or, maybe she’d just let them wither in the sink if the meeting didn’t go well. The world was her oyster, really.</p><p>When she returned a minute later, Rio was still standing there, expectantly. It dawned on her that she’d rudely forgotten to even introduce herself—hell, this woman probably didn’t even know her name. <em>No niceties, Agatha</em>, she chastised herself, before sticking out a hand and all-but-barking, “Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>The other woman quirked another smile before taking her hand, shaking it slowly. “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“A pleasure. Shoes off, please.”</p><p>“You don’t want to check my bag for that axe first?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not the TSA. Just know I have mace and I’m not afraid to use it.”</p><p>Their eyes met, Rio sensing Agatha’s challenge—her exertion that <em>she</em> was the one in control here. The other woman held Agatha’s gaze for a second, before raising a brow and giving a small, understanding nod.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Shoes.”</p><p>Rio obliged quickly, shucking her loafers and leaving them neatly next to each other by the door. Once Agatha was satisfied there would be no dirt tracked through her pristine apartment, she started walking over to the living room, simply assuming Rio would follow.</p><p>They settled on the well-worn purple couch, the one Agatha had found forlornly waiting for their neighbourhood trash collection a few blocks down, five years ago. Ralph hadn’t wanted to help her carry it home, so she’d sat stubbornly on it, meeting the stares of passersby with a challenging glare, until Wanda and Billy could make the drive from Jersey.</p><p>It was one of the many times Ralph had shown her exactly who he was, only for her not to take any notice.</p><p>“Nice couch,” Rio murmured, brushing her hand over the velvet.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha replied tightly. It wasn’t lost on her that this was the second time she was begrudgingly thanking this woman for doing or saying something nice. The sincerity of Rio’s gestures made Agatha’s chest itch.</p><p>“So…” she continued, voice clipped, breaking the silence that had awkwardly fallen around them. “I thought we could talk first and then I’ll give you the tour.”</p><p>“Whatever you want, boss.” The smile that stretched over Rio’s face at the retort was different to the ones she’d already handed her. Lazier, slower.</p><p>Agatha ignored the sensation Rio’s words—and that goddamn smirk—provoked in her belly, pressing on.</p><p>“You read the ad, so you know I’m looking for someone to help me pay my mortgage. Nothing more, nothing less,” she said. “I take it you’re good for the money.”</p><p>“Yeah, shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p>“You mentioned you work at a nursery,” Agatha redirected, suddenly confused.</p><p>“Yep,” Rio replied, not yet cottoning onto the curious uptick in Agatha’s tone. “And I also do massage on the side, and go to school.”</p><p>Making a mental note to come back to the massage part later, she narrowed her eyes and returned to her previous point of contention. “I thought nurseries were for potted plants and trees and stuff, not bouquets of flowers.”</p><p>“Ah,” Rio rubbed the back of her neck. She looked almost… sheepish? Nervous? “You got me there. Didn’t think you’d be so astute when it came to your greenery.”</p><p>“So, you went out of your way to, what… buy flowers for a stranger so you could con her into moving into her apartment?”</p><p>“Charm might be a better word for it,” Rio mused, “And is it working?”</p><p>“No. And don’t make a habit of it,” Agatha replied flatly.</p><p>“Anyway, good to know you’re gainfully employed. Are you clean?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>“Quiet?”</p><p>“Mm, mostly,” Rio chuckled.</p><p>“And is there a– someone on the scene? Like, someone you’re dating that I need to be aware of?”</p><p>Rio paused. “No. And to fill in the blanks for you–no boyfriends, ever. Girlfriends, maybe, but no one at the moment,” she said, her gaze cast down at her feet, a finger idly tracing over the <em>FUCK</em> that was written on the band of her sock.</p><p>Thank god; Agatha felt a wave of relief wash over her. The idea of bringing anyone else into her space was enough to send her into an anxiety spiral—especially a dirty, burping, unpredictable man. If she had to have a roommate, a single lesbian was kinda the best-case scenario.</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>Agatha froze. Although the question was a natural next step, she supposed, it still caught her off guard. The idea of relaying the last few weeks to anyone other than the people she’d already told—Wanda and her son Billy, and her agent, Jen, if only to explain why she’d not submitted a single chapter in over a month—was terrifying.</p><p>Maybe then she’d finally have to fully accept that this was real; that her mother’s suspicions about her, hell, her own suspicions about herself, were correct.</p><p>She chose to put it off a little longer.</p><p>“Nope,” she stared at Rio in silent opposition, popping the ‘p’ forcefully.</p><p>“That all you’re gonna give me?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, reaching a hand to her hair to run through it before realising, stupidly, it was still pulled back in a ponytail. She dropped it to her lap and took in Rio’s expression—curious but quiet, open, somehow; as if she were simply giving her room to speak.</p><p>“Yes, that's all I’m going to give you. I want to be clear here, Rio–I’m not looking for a ‘<em>bestie</em>’,” she raised her voice, tone mocking, “or someone to share my goddamn life story with. As long as you pay rent on time, don’t invite random people to the apartment without asking me first, and cut the noise by 10pm, that’s all I care about.”</p><p>“Right, right,” Rio nodded. “I guess I just want to make sure that <em>I’m</em> not gonna be living with some random person I don’t know, other than you. It goes both ways, you know.”</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, forced to give up the ghost. “Well, that won’t be a problem.”</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Satisfied with all Rio’s answers to her questions, and desperate to break the awkwardness that had settled around them, Agatha rose to her feet abruptly and waved a hand towards the rest of the house. She beckoned Rio to join her. “Alright, let me show you the place.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>They filtered through each room, chatting idly as she showed Rio the spare bedroom, its tiny en suite bathroom, the kitchen, the balcony with views of the Manhattan skyline. Rio kept the momentum of their conversation going, offering a wry joke here and there, but Agatha’s walls remained staunchly in place behind every painted-on smile or abbreviated chuckle.</p><p>Still, she managed to pry a few things out of her. Rio asked about Agatha’s job (a novelist working on her latest book), her star sign (Scorpio—with the world’s most fitting birthday, October 31st), and predictably, her sexuality (straight; no further comments).</p><p>Each question Rio asked felt like a razor blade scratching Agatha’s skin, her clipped answers a defence mechanism that would prevent it from sinking in further and drawing any blood.</p><p>After they’d finished the grand tour, they made their way back to the kitchen at the front of the apartment. The clock read 2pm, and Agatha felt drained—emotionally and physically. She’d barely eaten all morning, still struggling to keep much more than crackers and coffee down, and an ugly wave of nausea rippled through her like a reminder, starting at her oesophagus and travelling down to curl in her belly.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio eyed her curiously.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” Agatha exhaled, one elbow resting wearily on the kitchen counter. “Just not sleeping much at the moment.”</p><p>Spurred on by the heaviness behind her eyes and the nausea that had taken up residence in her gut, the reality of her situation hit her like a missile. She realised now was the time she’d have to deliver her news to Rio—a conversation that could easily be make-or-break for the other woman and her willingness to live in Agatha’s house.</p><p>So far, Rio had passed every test she had thrown at her, and although her constant quips and unwillingness to cower at Agatha’s ice-queen front were annoying, they weren’t exactly good enough reasons not to at least consider her for the room. So, she clenched her jaw and prepared herself to—shudder—be vulnerable for a second.</p><p>A beat. An internal deep breath.</p><p>“There’s one thing I should probably tell you before you go, if you’re still interested in the room.”</p><p>“I’m interested.” Rio looked up at her then, their eyes connecting again instantly. Blue meeting brown. Something flickered in those dark, intense eyes—something that might have been trying to say a little more than just <em>yes, keep telling me about the house</em>.</p><p>Whether it was concern for the fact that she was now practically doubled over the counter, or something else she couldn’t name, Agatha wasn’t sure.</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>She watched for a reaction.</p><p>Rio pressed a hand to her heart. “Am– am I the father?” she stuttered theatrically.</p><p>“Wha–” Agatha coughed, caught off guard. “Fuck, are you trying to make my heartburn worse on purpose with your ridiculous jokes?”</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek, as if she were trying to stifle a laugh. “If you were looking for a baby daddy, Agatha, you could’ve just said so in your ad.”</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Agatha sighed. The headache she definitely hadn’t had before Rio had arrived at her front door was magnifying now, each throb behind her eyeballs like a thunder clap. “I just want to make sure it’s not a problem for you. I– I know it’s kind of an odd situation.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. All the bravado leaked out of her demeanour then, replaced with a simple, pensive expression. “I don’t spook easily. How far along are you?”</p><p>“Ten weeks.”</p><p>“Cool.” Rio’s reply sounded genuine—like she really did think it was cool that she could be sharing a house with a newborn in less than nine months. “Morning sickness?” Rio gestured towards where her hand was still braced across the countertop, clearly cottoning onto the fact that Agatha’s visceral discomfort could be explained by her current situation.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Morning, afternoon, and night. Heartburn, vomiting, nausea, you name it. I don’t know if I’m growing a baby or a demon, at this point.”</p><p>Rio responded with a fleeting huff of laughter. “And when the kid comes?” she questioned.</p><p>“Nothing changes, I guess. I still need someone to help out with the bills, the mortgage. I don’t like my chances of finding someone who wants to share a New York apartment with a crying baby, but I don’t see an alternative, either.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha was dumbfounded at the simplicity of the response. Nothing ever left her speechless—but this? Well, this had rendered her close. “You don’t think it’s weird? You’re not gonna run for the hills the second you have to hear me barf up my breakfast or sidestep a cranky, hormonal lady in the kitchen?”</p><p>“Seems like you’re already kinda cranky,” Rio mused. “And anyway, I thought your personal life was none of my business. You know, ‘this is <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em>, not <em>RuPaul’s Best Friend Race</em>’ and all that. Every woman for herself.”</p><p>“Impossible,” Agatha muttered under her breath. She wondered how many of Rio’s dumb asides she’d have to endure if they were to actually live together.</p><p>(She also made a mental note to catch up on the latest season of <em>All Stars</em>.)</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“I said, ‘incredible’. Sounds like we’re on the same page, then.”</p><p>Rio just eyed her amusedly before changing tack. “So, how many other people have you got coming to look at the place?”</p><p>“A few,” Agatha lied. It was a half-truth, really—she hadn’t received any more Craigslist messages just yet, but if she did, she’d give them the courtesy of nosying into her space the same way she had Rio. “But I’ll decide pretty quickly once I’ve met everyone. I’ll let you know by the end of next week.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio nodded. “I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>“Don’t hold your breath on my account.”</p><p>Agatha stuck her hand out in Rio’s direction, a signal for her to leave. But, instead of shaking it, Rio took it in her own, leaning in.</p><p>Before she could register what was happening, Rio was pressing a quick but deliberate kiss to her cheek. Agatha felt the spot where Rio’s lips were burn at the contact.</p><p>The urge to instinctively pull back came over her, as if she was doing something wrong—but by the time she could react, Rio was already back in front of her, over a foot away, wearing a serene smile as if nothing remarkable had happened.</p><p>Agatha’s gut roiled, heavy and full. She blamed the morning sickness.</p><p>Rio slipped on her loafers and reached for the door handle to the apartment before tossing one last glance in Agatha’s direction, her words smooth and slow. “Te veo.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The five days since Rio had come to view the apartment on Sunday passed in a time-bending blur. If Agatha wasn’t chained to her desk, nursing a cup of herbal tea whilst she took her frustration out on her keyboard—a contradiction if there ever was one, the calm versus the chaos—she was fielding messages on Craigslist and coordinating the presence of various strangers in her space. </p><p>On Monday, there had been the annoyingly perky, sub-25-year-old pilates instructor that had shown her picture after picture of her Ken doll boyfriend. She was an easy no.</p><p>On Tuesday, she’d practically slammed the door in the face of a pale, greasy-looking <em> man </em> (in her defense, his name was Leslie) who had turned up wearing a fucking MAGA hat. Between the morning sickness, the insomnia, and the gravity of her situation threatening to close in around her, she had no patience for the casual racism or homophobia she just <em> knew </em> the man was capable of.</p><p>It was enough to make her want to vomit—which she promptly did the second he left. Whether it was the baby or the thought of Leslie desecrating her living room with FOX News, she’d never know. But sure, she could guess. </p><p>She’d had a few more visitors as the week went on, but none of them true contenders. They would either put her off in the first few seconds of forced conversation, or balk when she delivered the final blow; that she was pregnant and they’d have to live with a hormonal mother-to-be and eventually, a squalling newborn.</p><p>By Friday, Agatha had all but given up—which is how she’d ended up here, an empty message pulled up on her phone addressed to Rio. They’d moved from Craigslist messages to texting after Rio had insisted the app made her feel ‘seedy’, before attempting to strike up a conversation about the Craigslist killer, by whom she was unnaturally fascinated. </p><p>Agatha had just ignored the segue and saved her number to her phone.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Hi, Rio. I’ve met everyone who has expressed interest in the room and I think you’re the best candidate. If you’re still interested and haven’t yet found somewhere to live, let me know.  </em></p><p>A response lit up her phone a minute after she’d warily hit send.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> agatha!!! yes i would still LOVE to move in, the place is so cute. idk if i actually said that when we met, i was too busy enjoying watching you size me up lol. lmk when a good day to organize the moving van for would be? </em></p><p>And it had only taken <em> one </em> text to make Agatha feel like she was making a colossal mistake. </p><p>Rio’s chirpy, overly familiar response was… unsettling. She’d made it abundantly clear—or so she thought—that this wasn’t going to be a buddy-buddy kind of situation. </p><p>No, this was a business transaction; one where Rio kept to herself (and in an ideal world, rarely left her room), depositing a few grand in her bank account every month for the pleasure.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Honestly, whenever you like. I’m pretty much home all the time.  </em></p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> welllll harkness, don’t let me disrupt your busy schedule! </em> 😂 <em> ok so how’s sunday? </em></p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Sure, Sunday’s good. </em></p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> our one-week-since-meeting-aversary. celebrating by literally u-hauling… i love it. </em></p><p>Jesus, the girl was persistent. Agatha supposed she’d get an involuntary education in lesbianism while living with Rio—although the U-haul quip certainly didn’t go over her head. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Ha-ha. I’ll see you Sunday. Text me a time once you’ve organised your truck. I’ll send you my bank details for the first month.  </em></p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> will do. te veo </em>💚</p><p>She blew a stray strand of hair out of her face: it was done. No more roommate-hunting clouding her days. Now to move onto the main course—living with another human that wasn’t Ralph for the first time in close to a decade. A chatty, too-comfortable, unfortunately-her-best-option human, at that.</p><p>From her position at her desk, her gaze drifted to the bunch of azaleas that she’d propped up in a vase, now sitting feet away from her on the fireplace mantle. She hadn’t had the heart to throw them out like she’d planned, even as the petals began to wither.</p><p>Instead, she’d found herself staring at them in moments of deep contemplation, whether she was ruminating over her novel’s main character arc or what the next eight or so months of her life would look like. They were pretty, bright; more life than Agatha’s apartment had seen in a while.</p><p>Maybe living with someone else wouldn’t be all that bad. Maybe having someone else to consider would shift Agatha’s mood a little. Make her nicer, more mindful.</p><p>Or maybe they’d be at each other’s throats in a week.</p><p>Her phone dinged again, breaking her out of her trance and away from the flurry of purple and white in front of her. </p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> be there at 10am on sunday. see you soon, agatha.  </em></p><p align="center">———</p><p>Agatha heard Rio’s arrival before she actually saw her, hanging out the window of the U-Haul truck that rumbled down the street and parked haphazardly across two street spaces a few doors down from her apartment building. </p><p>Well, she hadn’t been joking about the U-Haul. </p><p>A petite Asian woman with red streaks in her black hair hopped out of the driver’s side before rounding the curb to the other side of the truck and extending a hand to Rio. She took it and bounced down, full of energy. </p><p>From her position on the apartment balcony, Agatha couldn’t read the cues well enough to figure out who this woman was, but she suspected either a friend or someone Rio was seeing. Although, she <em> had </em> said no girlfriend… </p><p>Anyway, as long as Agatha didn’t have to make awkward conversation with her over her morning cereal, her relationship to Rio was none of her business. </p><p>They neared closer to the building and more of Rio’s form came into Agatha’s view. Her hair was knotted in a loose bun at the nape of her neck, curtain bangs escaping messily. One of the straps of her khaki overalls had come free from her shoulder, hanging around her waist and revealing another tank top—white, this time. The messenger bag had been replaced with a plain green tote that looked like it was a second away from falling apart at the seams because of all the stuff crammed into it.</p><p>She watched from the balcony as Rio ambled up to the door, hand shielding her eyes from the sun, and began to fiddle with the intercom. </p><p>“Rio!” she shouted in the woman’s direction, hoping she could hear her despite the noisy ambience of Williamsburg on a sunny Sunday morning. </p><p>Glancing up, Rio’s eyes found where Agatha was leaning against the balcony railing, and lit up immediately. She raised two fingers in salute. “Ahoy, sailor!” </p><p>“I’m gonna drop the keys down to you,” Agatha said, promptly tossing a bundle of silver over the railing, which Rio caught one-handed. </p><p>“Thanks!” Rio called up, then made a move to unlock the building’s front door, propping it open. She jogged back to the U-Haul and her friend, where the two of them began to unload boxes from the vehicle and precariously stack them on top of one another.</p><p>Upstairs, Agatha re-entered the house and busied herself making a coffee while she waited for Rio. Her last morning living by herself—probably for at least the next 18 years, she realised. Even if Rio’s presence in her home was short-lived, she’d have a <em> child </em> in a matter of months.</p><p>The thought simultaneously terrified her and bloomed warm and hopeful in her chest. </p><p>A couple of minutes later, Agatha heard the keys jiggle in the front door lock, and in tumbled Rio and her accomplice, arms laden with boxes. The tattoos on Rio’s right bicep rippled and distorted with exertion as she dropped them in the doorway, taking the place in for the second time. </p><p>“Morning,” Agatha greeted. </p><p>“Glasses,” Rio said by way of a ‘hello’, cocking her head to one side. “They suit you.” </p><p>Agatha’s hand sprung to her face—sure enough, she was still wearing her wire-rimmed reading glasses, the ones that Wanda said made her look like Jeffrey Dahmer. She didn’t dare mention this fact to Rio, lest she launch into another serial killer origin story that Agatha didn’t have the patience or the constitution for. </p><p>For a woman who had assured Agatha she was harmless and not trying to off her in her sleep, Rio sure had a strange hyperfixation with murder. </p><p>“Thanks,” she nodded in robotic response to yet another one of Rio’s freely given compliments. “Glad you made it here safely.” </p><p>And at that, Rio <em> beamed.</em> Like the sun had decided she was the only person in the world worth shining for, and now it was her job to pass along some of that sunlight to Agatha.</p><p>“Thanks, Agatha,” Rio said, the blaze of her smile never dimming. “Oh, shit, before I forget and squish it—” she fumbled around in the tote bag she was carrying. “I brought you something. A reverse housewarming gift, if you will,” she said, extending her hands in offering. </p><p>In them was a cardboard coffee cup holder, the kind they gave you when you ordered two drinks, but instead of a beverage, in one of the slots sat a plant. A bulbous green cactus that had sprouted a single purple flower.</p><p>“I thought I told you to not make a habit of bringing me flowers,” Agatha chastised. She’d meant for her voice to come out sharp, but it carried less of her usual bite. She just couldn’t muster it after seeing Rio so genuinely happy to receive a single, barely-there nicety from her. </p><p>Instinctively, she reached out and took it, ears buzzing as Rio clarified. “It’s not a flower. It’s a cactus that just happened to sprout a flower. And it reminded me of you,” she shrugged.</p><p>There was that heartburn again. Agatha’s free hand fluttered to her chest and she swallowed thickly. But before she could open her mouth to retort, to question what Rio meant, the sound of a throat clearing echoed from the doorway. </p><p>And then they remembered there was another person in the room. </p><p>Rio’s friend, or not-girlfriend, or whoever she was—a tidbit of information Agatha reminded herself she did not need to know or care about—was still lingering in the doorway, boxes dropped at her feet next to Rio’s.</p><p>She waggled her silver-ring-coated fingers in Agatha’s direction. “Hey,” the woman said.</p><p>“Fuck, Al, I’m so sorry– Alice, this is Agatha,” Rio gestured, “Agatha, Alice. My best friend.” </p><p>“Nice to meet you, Alice,” Agatha said calmly. </p><p>“Yeah, you too,” Alice replied. “Nice place you’ve got here.” </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha hummed. Alice was right—her place <em> was </em> nice. It just wasn’t completely <em> hers </em>anymore, and that was going to take some getting used to. Starting with the boxes currently cluttering her entryway. </p><p>“You guys should go unpack,” Agatha said, nodding towards the spare room. Rio’s room. “Let me know if you have any questions about anything. I probably shouldn’t be doing any heavy lifting.” She eyed Rio, who gave her a small nod of understanding. </p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee and read <em> The Times </em>while the two of them filtered in and out of the front door, exchanging easy conversation as they hauled Rio’s stuff from the entryway to her bedroom. It was close to noon when the last box was lugged through the door, Rio looking a little red-faced and Alice cracking her joints.</p><p>“Alright,” Alice said, her hands knotted together above her head in a languid stretch. “I think my job here is done.”</p><p>“You’re the best, Al,” Rio gave her friend a squeeze on the shoulder, guiding her to the stairwell. </p><p>A few minutes later, Rio returned solo. “Guess it’s just us now,” she said. </p><p>Agatha stilled from where she was still sitting at the kitchen island, pen poised over a journal full of book notes. “Yep,” she agreed tightly. “You all set up in your room?”</p><p>“Mmm, kinda,” Rio replied, “I’m sure it’ll take a while to make it feel like home.” </p><p><em> Home</em>. Agatha fought the urge to scream, <em> this is my home, not yours </em>—to exert any last shred of control she had left over her rapidly spiralling life. </p><p>But she didn’t, because Rio wasn’t wrong. It was her home now too, one they would have to learn to share. But that didn’t mean she was just going to hand over the reins and let Rio infiltrate her entire life with her charm, with the easygoing warmth and wit that caused Agatha a great deal of discomfort—physical and otherwise.</p><p>The key to getting along, to not letting this become something that it wasn’t, was setting boundaries. And that started with only making conversation when they absolutely had to.</p><p>“Well, don’t let me ruin your flow. I’ll leave you to it,” Agatha said, shifting her gaze back to her notes in a silent dismissal. </p><p>Rio nodded, grabbing the tote bag she’d left hanging from one of Agatha’s kitchen counter stools and exiting the room with a hasty wave. </p><p>Agatha prayed she’d be in her room, getting things set up for a while. She needed space to breathe, to think, and she couldn’t do that with Rio’s easy presence in her periphery.</p><p>Her eyes fell to the cactus this time. What had Rio meant when she said it reminded her of Agatha? Was she calling her prickly, defensive? She couldn’t fault that—she <em> was </em>both of those things. She could make excuses for herself; claim that the last few weeks had made her cold, unwilling to give people who weren’t Wanda or Billy the time of day out of sheer exhaustion. </p><p>But the truth was, she’d felt like this for a while. Suffocated. Rigid. So, so alone—but also unwilling to give anyone new access to her, for reasons she’d barely begun to examine. </p><p>Somehow, though, a heavy-handed, surface-level metaphor like that didn’t seem very Rio, as little as she actually knew about the other woman. There was more to it, she was certain.</p><p>Something in her desperately wanted to know. </p><p>But wanting and doing were two very different things—and the idea of Rio <em> seeing </em>her, of her perceptions of Agatha hitting a little too close to home, was enough to keep her quiet.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Rio and Agatha’s first week of living together was, as Agatha had predicted, an adjustment. She’d cultivated a laundry list of routines and likes and dislikes in her 42 years, and it was becoming glaringly obvious that she would only stray from those habits under serious duress. </p><p>And because she wasn’t going to be the one to concede, that meant Rio had to relent—even if it meant Agatha was the one actually doing the work.</p><p>First, there was the dishwasher. Over time, Agatha had curated a militaristic approach to stacking that would’ve put professional organisers to shame. Everything had its place, and her cutlery <em> always </em>came out gleaming as if it was pure, polished silver. </p><p>With Rio under her roof, stacking the dishwasher had become a contact sport—the contact being Agatha slamming bowls and forks on the granite countertops as she rearranged its entire contents in disbelief that anyone thought it acceptable to put plates on the top rack. </p><p>She fixed it, but she didn’t dare say anything to Rio.</p><p>More grievances piled up the more days that went by—small but irritating nonetheless. Tiny teaspoons cluttered the sink on the days Rio was home, remnants of her concerningly frequent coffee breaks. Handwritten notes and textbooks about educational pedagogy and high school biology blinked up at her from where they rested on her coffee table, albeit in a neatly stacked pile, but still, <em> there</em>.</p><p>Her fridge now held oat milk and kim chi and bunches of fresh herbs, and when she flicked on the TV, the first channel that came up most mornings was not MSNBC, but National Geographic. It was all too much, and it was threatening to send Agatha into a tailspin. </p><p>Still, she said nothing. </p><p>The final straw was their morning routines. Agatha, ever the night owl, liked to wake up slowly, rarely leaving her bedroom before 9am. </p><p>Rio, on the other hand, turned out to be a morning person. She’d hear the front door bang shut at 6am every morning, an unwelcome shock cutting through her carefully cultivated peace. An hour later, the metallic clang of keys signalled Rio had returned from her excursion.</p><p>The first few mornings, she’d groaned into her pillow and tried to force herself back to sleep for a few precious hours. God knows she needed the rest, what with the insomnia still kicking her ass and delaying her bedtime until she could practically hear birdsong. </p><p>But after more than a week of being unceremoniously awoken, it was almost as if her body had adapted to Rio’s routine, and at 6am, she was depressingly, frustratingly, awake. </p><p>So, she did what any sane human would do. She pulled a robe around her, stomped into the kitchen, and made a coffee while she laid in wait for Rio to return home. Agatha liked to think of herself as a practical person, and that’s all this was—a quick ripping off of the bandaid, a matter-of-fact request for Rio to keep it the fuck down so she could get some sleep.</p><p>“Holy fucking <em> shit</em>,” Rio jumped, startled by Agatha’s stony-faced presence at the kitchen island, where she was tucked into one of the barstools. She pulled an Airpod out of one ear and braced herself on the counter, breathing heavily. </p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said drily, making no attempts to hide her exhaustion—although she was sure the deep bags under her eyes were doing more than enough in that department. She took in Rio’s sweaty ponytail and green spandex shorts and put the pieces together. “Went for a little run, I take it?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio narrowed her eyes in confusion, her breathing slowing. “I try and get a couple of miles in every morning.” </p><p>Agatha simply arched a brow and hummed, “mm, I’ve noticed.”</p><p>Rio rounded the counter, grabbing herself a glass from the cabinet and filling it with water from the filter jug that lived in the fridge. It wasn’t lost on Agatha that even such a short time in, Rio appeared to be comfortable. Maybe a little <em> too </em>comfortable.</p><p>Once she’d taken a few swigs, she turned around again and fixed Agatha with a look. Not steely, not challenging—just calm. “Is my going for a run in the morning an issue for you?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know about you, but existing on three hours of sleep after I’ve been up all night chucking my guts out isn’t my idea of fun. I’d appreciate it if you could be a little quieter.” </p><p>She braced herself for a fight. Sharpened her claws, mentally replayed her arguments. Took a breath, ready to pounce. </p><p>In her head, it wasn’t an unwarranted reaction. Any time she’d brought up this kind of thing with Ralph—her only real frame of reference—it had turned into either a screaming match or days upon days of the silent treatment (sometimes led by him, but most of the time, by Agatha).</p><p>But Rio wasn’t Ralph, another fact that was becoming very clear as time went by. Which is why she shouldn’t have been surprised when Rio just chuckled. </p><p>“You’re the boss,” she mimed zipping her lips and throwing away the key. “Quiet as a mouse, I’ll be. We wouldn’t want that baby in there coming out addicted to caffeine, now, would we?” </p><p>She smirked at Agatha’s giant mug, which was now completely drained of coffee.</p><p>So no fight, then.</p><p>Agatha fixed her eyes on Rio and offered her a tight, small smile. “I don’t think it’s got any say in the matter,” she admitted. “Coffee’s the only thing keeping me vertical.”</p><p>Rio leaned her elbows on the counter, face no more than a foot away from Agatha’s. She rested her head on one hand thoughtfully. “Well, there are worse things to be addicted to. You could be doing meth. Or eating too much sugar. Hear they’re about the same, in terms of fetal development.” </p><p>Before Agatha could catch herself, she let out a snort of laughter. </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in amused surprise. “<em>Agatha Harkness</em>. Was that a laugh I just heard? For me?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, pulling her top lip between her teeth in a desperate attempt to not dignify Rio’s silly jokes with any more laughter. Still, her icy gaze had thawed, if only a little.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she deadpanned.</p><p>Rio just smirked. “Just you wait, Harkness. I’ll win you over yet.”</p><p>“Okay, I’m gonna go shower before work,” Rio rounded the counter and started making her way to her room, dismantling her messy ponytail with a quick tug of her hair tie. “Have a good day.” </p><p>Agatha turned and watched Rio start to walk away before mustering the courage to say the thing she’d been wanting to for the better half of their conversation—since Rio had, in the face of being ambushed, simply laid down and rolled over. </p><p>“Hey,” she called out to Rio, who turned around slowly. “Thanks for not making it a thing.” </p><p>And when Agatha said it, she realised she genuinely meant it—that she <em> was </em> appreciative of Rio’s willingness to just hand her control, no questions asked. It didn’t make much sense, but it was what she needed right now, and somehow, Rio had understood that.</p><p>It seemed as if she understood this, too—the vastly undersized gesture that Agatha was rewarding her with, her version of a peace offering.</p><p>“No worries,” Rio replied kindly, her brown eyes warm as they always were. “Any time.” </p><p align="center">———</p><p>Agatha was tucked up in her bed, absentmindedly scrolling through her emails post-afternoon nap, when her phone buzzed with a familiar contact—Wanda. </p><p>It had been a few weeks since she’d seen her best friend, but they’d texted a little; mainly about Agatha’s plethora of pregnancy symptoms and what Billy was up to (going overboard on the eyeliner, worrying over impending college applications, trying and failing to get a summer job at Hot Topic). She was sure she’d asked about Tommy, too, but his activities hadn’t really sunken in—Agatha was unashamedly the type to pick favourites, and she’d done so a long time ago. </p><p>They’d briefly touched on Agatha’s roommate situation, and she’d told her someone was moving in, but offered no more information. </p><p>Which was probably why, when Agatha answered the call on the third ring, Wanda barely greeted her before launching into the Spanish Inquisition. “So, how’s the new roommate?”</p><p>“Boring day at the office?” Agatha deflected. Wanda was a therapist, which meant her life was full of other people’s drama, much of which she shared with Agatha in what she was certain was a direct violation of HIPAA. While she never gave up names or specifics, she always had a juicy story on hand or a new client she needed to vent about.</p><p>Frustratingly, it also meant that she was the only person in the world who knew which buttons to push to cut through Agatha’s bullshit.</p><p>“Focus, Harkness,” Wanda intoned drily. “Updates, now.” </p><p>Agatha dragged her hands over her face. “I don’t walk to talk about it,” she groaned in response. </p><p>“Ooft. Is she really that bad?”</p><p>“She’s fine,” she grumbled. “It’s just an adjustment.”</p><p>“Are you going to tell me a single shred of information about her, or are we playing 20 Questions?”</p><p>“There’s nothing much to tell, Wanda. Her name is Rio, she’s 31, and she works two jobs and studies her master’s. So, she’s extremely busy, <em> as am I</em>,” Agatha emphasised. </p><p>She shifted onto her side and tucked a pillow between her legs, hoping that more physical comfort might make the conversation they were having marginally less uncomfortable. </p><p>“You’re literally always home, and you haven’t lived with anyone but Ralph for years. Surely you have commentary, even if it’s just that she stacks the dishwasher wrong,” Wanda probed. “I know you, Agatha.” </p><p>“Fine,” she relented. Wanda was giving her a gateway to talk about her frustrations, which she supposed was probably healthy, opposed to bottling them up or taking them out on Rio. She just hoped her friend was prepared for the floodgates to open. </p><p>“She drinks way too many stupid cups of coffee and leaves little spoons in my sink instead of washing them. She wakes up every morning at the crack of fucking dawn to go for a <em> run</em>,” Agatha listed off. “And she <em> does </em>stack the dishwasher wrong,” she affirmed grumpily. “Satisfied?”</p><p>Wanda let out a soft huff of laughter, and Agatha rolled her eyes. Even though they weren’t on FaceTime, Agatha could picture Wanda’s expression—sizing her up, ready to call her out for overreacting. </p><p>“Those are all pretty minor grievances, hon,” her best friend replied gently. “They’re just the perils of living with a new person.” </p><p>“I haven’t even told you about the fucking flowers,” Agatha said, winding up for the story. “She works at a nursery—a plant nursery—and has this odd habit of bringing me unsolicited floral items. So far there’s been a bunch of azaleas and a succulent,” she huffed. “She’s trying to turn my house into a fucking jungle. It’s unhinged.” </p><p>“The woman’s bringing you flowers? Jesus, I think you’ve bagged yourself the best roommate in the world,” Wanda joked. “Does she need a wife? Because I don’t think Vision would mind.” </p><p>(She was right—he probably wouldn’t. That man was unhealthily obsessed with Wanda, and would do anything to keep her happy, including, Agatha imagined, letting her have a side piece.) </p><p>“Well, she <em> is </em> gay, but that’s beside the point. Don’t you think it’s weird?”</p><p>“Another point in her column,” Wanda hummed, before clarifying. “The lesbian thing, I mean.” <em> Something they could agree on</em>, Agatha thought. </p><p>“But to answer your question, no. I don’t think it’s weird. I think it’s… sweet. Kind. She honestly sounds kinda great.” </p><p>Agatha snorted. “She’s tolerable at best.”</p><p>“You know, there are worse things than actually enjoying the company of the person you live with,” Wanda said gently. </p><p>That one certainly hit its intended mark. </p><p>Agatha thought of Ralph; thought of her mother. Of homes that had felt more like prisons, one partly of her own doing and another, completely out of her control. She tipped her head so she was staring at the ceiling fan, letting its whirring sounds and constant motion recenter her. </p><p>“I don’t enjoy her company, and I don’t plan on that changing,” she finally gritted out.</p><p>“All I’m saying is tread carefully,” Wanda warned. “The last thing you need right now is to ice this girl out so completely that she evicts herself before you can make a mortgage repayment.” </p><p>Agatha grunted in acknowledgment. She couldn’t bring herself to say anything more—to change the topic or go back to venting about Rio. Instead, she just lay there.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda’s voice came gently through the speaker a few moments later. “Are you doing okay?” </p><p>She sucked in a breath. “I’m fine, Wanda,” she lied, but her voice came out smaller than she intended it to. Rising to the challenge Wanda’s concern flared in her, she spoke again, more forcefully this time: “Everything’s fine.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda spoke quietly again. “I just— I just need you to know that I’ll be here if it gets too much to carry alone. An unexpected pregnancy, the end of a relationship, a new living situation… you’ve had the month from hell.” </p><p><em> Alone.</em> There was that word again; the one that repeated in her head, day-in, day-out, her mother’s voice ringing in her ears. <em> You’re alone in this world, Agatha. No one could ever love a girl as wicked as you. </em></p><p>Fuck Wanda and her uncanny ability to stare straight into the depths of Agatha’s soul.</p><p>She pressed her fingers to the sockets of her eyes, meeting a hint of wetness that she furiously blinked away. No—she wasn’t allowed to do this; not now, and not ever. She had to hold her shit together, even if it meant dropping every other ball in the process. </p><p>Because that’s what survival was, wasn’t it? Keeping the walls of your own room up while the rest of the house burned to the fucking ground. </p><p>“I said I’m fine, Wanda.” </p><p>But because this was the one person she couldn’t push away—who wouldn’t let herself be pushed away—she fought against her survival instincts and didn’t hang up the phone.</p><p>She spoke into the silence again. “But I know,” she affirmed Wanda’s offer softly. “If I need to talk, you’ll be the first person I call.” </p><p>Agatha hesitated. “And I’ll be nicer to her. To Rio,” she swallowed. “I’ll try." </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha’s resolution to be nicer to Rio had been going well, which, in part, was thanks to Rio’s schedule. Despite her presence in the house in the early mornings and late evenings, now that she was all moved in and back to a full-time workload, she was barely home. </p><p>If Rio wasn’t at the nursery, she was attending summer college classes, or as Agatha had discovered through a curious glance at her planner (left open on the coffee table, thank you very much), taking a couple of longstanding massage clients. </p><p>Throughout the day, the house was quiet while Rio was at work or school, just as Agatha liked it. She revelled in the uninterrupted time she had to work on her novel just as much as she did being able to walk around butt naked or lie prone on the couch with a bag of Cheetos on her chest like she was right now, watching the afternoon sunlight filter in through the apartment windows. </p><p>She scarfed another handful of radioactive orange and sighed. Of course, Agatha knew she was partially responsible for the ceasefire, too. Wanda’s words had landed with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but she had been right: she could only push Rio so far, or so she guessed.</p><p>Up until now, the other woman had received Agatha’s jabs with grace, but everybody had a breaking point—she just hadn’t found Rio’s yet. And after their early morning confrontation had fizzled into nothing more than a convivial chat, she wasn’t sure she really wanted to.</p><p>The walls of her home were expanding—not in a literal sense, Brooklyn apartments be damned, but figuratively—to accommodate the presence of another person. Rio had cottoned onto the dishwasher regimen without having to be asked, and Agatha would find teaspoons lined up like soldiers on the top shelf rather than having some kind of metallic orgy in her sink. </p><p>They’d settled into a comfortable routine, Agatha still skirting around her at times, but never going out of her way to be mean or overbearing. Rio had given her everything she’d ever wanted out of a roommate—the perfect co-habitator.</p><p>So why did it feel so fucking <em> weird</em>? </p><p>Now, instead of finding reasons not to get to know Rio better, she was at a loss with what to do with her. And whether it happened as they crossed each other in the hallway or tried to not bump into one another in the kitchen as they made their morning coffees, it felt inevitable that soon, a crack would appear—that she would have no choice but to learn new details about Rio, to flesh out the person she was in her head beyond her lazy charm and never-ending Rolodex of wisecracks. </p><p>Her phone dinged from where she’d let it disappear beneath the couch cushions. Licking her fingers clean of Cheeto dust, she reached for it and unlocked it, Rio’s name lighting up her screen. It was 4pm—she’d probably just gotten off shift at the nursery and was on her way back to the apartment. </p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> hey, i’m getting some groceries, do you need anything??  </em></p><p>It didn’t help Agatha’s predicament that Rio was unfailingly considerate. She glanced over at the kitchen, where she knew her shelves of the fridge were borderline empty, milk on its last legs and veggies a day away from becoming compost in the crisper.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> No, I’m okay. Thanks though. </em></p><p>She’d have to do a grocery order sooner or later, but it wasn’t Rio’s responsibility to take care of her. She could do that perfectly well herself—she’d been doing it her entire life, all the way since childhood when the unofficial house rules were ‘figure out a way to feed yourself, or starve’. </p><p>Things hadn’t really changed in her adulthood, even as she’d drifted in and out of various romantic entanglements. Until Ralph, she’d never lived with a boyfriend—and foolishly, she’d let him set the standard. And that standard meant he’d never bothered to lift a finger around the apartment, let alone have the foresight to pick up groceries or learn how to clean the way she liked. Hell, who was she kidding. Ralph had never cleaned, period. </p><p>It struck Agatha that since his unceremonious departure two months ago, she hadn’t really stopped to think much about Ralph. Wanda had urged her to ‘take time to grieve’, but that had seemed a little over-the-top… the man wasn’t dead; he was probably just gambling away his child’s inheritance or dick-deep in a woman half her age. </p><p>The only time she’d given him more than a second thought was when her mind turned to the baby—this kid she was so ill-equipped to bring into the world, who now would have to bear the pain of having a deadbeat dad, one she herself knew intimately. </p><p>But Ralph as her boyfriend; her <em> romantic partner</em>? </p><p>It was like someone had waved a magic wand and erased him from her memory. It was equal parts scary and satisfying.</p><p>Agatha’s phone dinged again. She checked it, yawning.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> i got you a couple things anyway. don’t think i didn’t notice you go through like 4 packets of cheetos a week. and the use-by date on your milk was yesterday.  </em></p><p>Agatha squinted at the text. It was unnervingly… domestic. Too attentive, too perceptive. </p><p>As if holding it a second longer could burn her skin, she threw her phone onto the armchair across the room with better aim than she’d expected and directed her attention to the TV. She’d flicked it on as background noise while she oscillated between daydreaming and filling the void with junk food, and it was playing a documentary about frogs, residue from Rio’s borderline childlike viewing preferences. </p><p>The remote was on the TV unit, too far to reach without getting up. So, she just let it play, let the narrator’s soothing voice and the ambient rainforest sounds of the documentary form a rhythmic lullaby. It had been far too long since she’d slept, she thought; one last rumination before her thoughts petered out entirely. </p><p>When Rio returned home with the groceries, she found Agatha passed out on the couch, David Attenborough murmuring in the background. She quietly put the groceries away, then wandered over to Agatha and pulled a blanket over her peaceful form before leaving her to rest.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>As she neared the 12-week mark of her pregnancy, Agatha was cautiously optimistic that her symptoms would begin to let up. It had been day after day of nausea as a wake-up call and insomnia as a bedtime story, and she felt just as haggard as she looked—a fact that Jen, her literary agent, had pointed out on their most recent Zoom call about her novel’s progress.</p><p>
<em> “You look like shit,” Jen had said, blinking as she took in Agatha’s unbrushed hair, sallow skin, and the dark circles that rimmed her eyes like days-old eyeliner.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It’s the webcam,” Agatha replied drily. “Or the fetus. Not sure which.”  </em>
</p><p>But 12 weeks was meant to be when things started to look up. It was when most people got the all-clear to tell their family and friends (not that Agatha had paid any attention to that—doctors were all egotistical schmucks, anyway), when miscarriage risk took a nosedive, and when your energy would start to return, according to the internet.</p><p>So, colour Agatha surprised when, at 12 weeks and 3 days pregnant, she found herself jolted from a particularly vivid dream about her mother by the unmistakable urge to projectile vomit. Not normal barfing, no—that would be too easy for Agatha Harkness, the devil’s favourite plaything. </p><p>Projectile. Fucking. Puking.</p><p>She launched herself out of bed, running far away from her expensive, Belgian flax linen bed sheets and towards the nearest moppable surface. But, because Agatha liked cupboard space for her fancy skincare and her collection of dust-covered hair styling tools, <em> her </em> bathroom happened to be the guest bathroom—the bigger of the two compared to Rio’s en suite, the one that was sandwiched between her bedroom and the living room. </p><p>Mid-sprint, Agatha said a silent Hail Mary, the first prayer she’d dignified since her mother kicked the bucket and she stopped humouring her by attending church—and thank <em> fucking </em> god, Mary came through. She made it to the bathroom with milliseconds to spare, throwing herself at the toilet bowl and emptying the contents of her stomach into it with violent speed and force.</p><p>The next hour passed in infuriating slow motion as Agatha oscillated between lying on the bathroom floor, robe undone, and crawling her way back to the toilet bowl to puke.</p><p>She’d all but thought this was how she was going to die, face-down on porcelain, when she heard footsteps echoing through the apartment—<em> Rio</em>.</p><p>
<em> Jesus fuck, this couldn’t be happening.</em>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio called out, her voice carrying through from the entryway. “Agatha?” it came again. </p><p>Since they’d become a little more friendly (or Agatha had become a little less hostile), Rio had taken to striking up a conversation with her when she returned home from work or school. Most of the time, they’d just exchange pleasantries before Agatha excused herself to work on her book, but every now and then, they’d shoot the shit about the weather or something equally as unimportant until Rio bounded off to her next activity. </p><p>So, it wasn’t unusual that her roommate was out there, calling her name to see if she was home—it was just extremely inopportune.</p><p>Agatha considered staying quiet for a minute, pretending she wasn’t home. But, her autonomy was swiftly taken away from her when another fucking <em> tsunami </em> of nausea rolled over her, forcing her to scuttle from her spot on the tiles back to the toilet, retching loudly. </p><p>She could only imagine what Rio must be thinking now. Ruing her decision to live with a pregnant lady who was putting on a one-woman reenactment of <em> The Exorcist</em>, no doubt. </p><p>A few seconds after she’d finished wiping spit and bile from her chin, a gentle knock came at the door. <em> Oh, this could </em> not <em> be happening</em>, Agatha thought, head in her hands. But she didn’t have the energy to protest, to tell Rio to go away—she was just too tired.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio’s voice filtered in, soft and calm. “You holding up okay in there? It sounded… violent.”</p><p>“It feels like it’s trying to fucking claw its way out of me through my throat,” she moaned, resting her head against the toilet bowl. “I don’t think this is normal. Can you Google if it’s normal?” </p><p>There was a pause, some shuffling. Agatha wondered if Rio had chosen self-preservation and evacuated the premises to avoid being splattered by vomit—she wouldn’t blame her if she had. </p><p>But a minute or so later, she heard a concerned hum. It was closer than before, and Agatha realised Rio had taken up residence on the floor, right outside the bathroom door. “Potentially abnormal, but not unheard of, according to the good doctor Google,” Rio said. “Have you had enough fluids?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha croaked back, “can’t keep anything down.”</p><p>Another pause. Then: “When was the last time you ate, Agatha?”</p><p>“Sunday night?” she hazarded a guess. </p><p>“Christ—” Irritation flared in Rio’s voice before she schooled herself and continued. “Agatha, it’s Tuesday.”</p><p>“Actually, I think I had some crackers yesterday? But they’re long gone,” she said, looking forlornly at the toilet bowl. </p><p>“Okay, you need to eat something and drink something,” Rio started, but Agatha interrupted her with another moan of self-pity. The idea of voluntarily putting something in her stomach only for it to flip in on itself was surely a fool’s errand. </p><p>But the woman sitting outside her bathroom door? Well, she wasn’t taking no for an answer. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you can’t, Agatha. I’m making you some tea and toast.” She heard shuffling again, feet padding across the hall and over to the kitchen. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Agatha reached over and held down the flush, erasing the evidence. God forbid Rio try to enter the bathroom and be met with a damn crime scene. In her haste to not throw up all over the walls of her apartment, she hadn’t locked the door.</p><p>She stared at the water swirling in the toilet bowl. Spiralling—it was fitting, really. An apt metaphor for Agatha’s life, which as a writer, she took very seriously. God, the universe was really trying to push her off a fucking cliff. </p><p>Five minutes later, there was another knock at the bathroom door. “Come on, Agatha. Food.”</p><p>“I— <em> fuck</em>,” she cursed under her breath as she tried to haul herself up from the bathroom floor, her muscles weak and sore, protesting underneath her. “I-I don’t think I can get up.” </p><p>“Floor or table?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Rio, what part of ‘I can’t get up’ didn’t you understand?” Maybe she did have a shred of energy left in her—and she’d be damned if she didn’t use it on being snarky.</p><p>“I know that, Agatha,” Rio chuckled. “I mean, do you want to eat your toast on the bathroom floor, or do you want me to help you up so you can sit at the table?”</p><p>She pondered this for a second. The floor seemed like the easier option—but trying to keep her food down in a small, windowless New York bathroom that smelled like barf?</p><p>Her voice came out as a whine. “Table.” </p><p>With shaky hands, she knotted the tie on her robe and pulled it over herself. The whole situation was bad enough—her roommate seeing her half-naked would be the icing on the cake.</p><p>“Alright. I’m coming in,” Rio warned. The door handle turned, and there she was, standing warily in the doorway. “Fuck, you made the right choice,” she coughed, covering her nose with her arm. “That’s some post-apocalyptic shit.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a watery smile. “I know,” she said, the words like daggers in her throat. “You didn’t have to do this.” </p><p>Rio shook her head and made her way over to where Agatha was still slumped, boneless, over the toilet bowl. “God, you’re annoying, you know that?”</p><p>“<em>I’m </em>annoying?” </p><p>“Yes, you,” she smirked. “Now let’s get you up.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a second, neither saying anything, both silently calculating the logistics of exactly how Rio was going to get Agatha in her half-comatose state to the other side of their apartment. </p><p>Rio figured it out first, crouching down next to Agatha and slipping her hands underneath Agatha’s armpits, before rising and hauling her to her feet like it was nothing. She fixed her brown eyes on Agatha’s watery blue ones in a question. “Okay?” she checked.</p><p>Agatha nodded, exhaling slowly as the blood rushed to her head. She closed her eyes and softly hummed in agreement. She couldn’t remember the last time she felt this weak; not just her body, but her spirit, her resolve. The only thing she could do now was surrender. </p><p>Rio looped a strong arm around her shoulders, steadying her. Together, they took a few hesitant steps out of the bathroom, Agatha’s hands twitching by her sides, uncomfortable at the sudden contact but not willing to risk the alternative; of letting go and keeling to the floor.</p><p>Halfway to the kitchen, Agatha suddenly stopped. The room had begun to tilt on its axis around her, little black dots forming in her vision.</p><p>“Hey, hey—” Rio let go of her shoulders and gripped her waist so they were face to face. “Don’t give up on me now, Harkness. We’re almost there,” she encouraged.</p><p>“Room’s spinning,” Agatha forced out, her eyes squeezed shut, trying to banish the dots. </p><p>She felt the ghost of a touch along her jaw, and her eyes flickered open in surprise. But Rio didn’t flinch or back away—just rested her hand on Agatha’s face and looked into her eyes. “You’ve got this,” she said with a smile. Agatha just stared back at her, wide-eyed and too weary to protest. </p><p>Instead of returning her arm to Agatha’s shoulders, Rio kept one fixed firmly around her waist and grabbed Agatha’s hand in the other, clasping it tightly with her own in front of them. It anchored her as they began to walk again, slower this time.</p><p>Finally, they made it to the table, where a plate of toast laden with butter and a cup of tea in Agatha’s favourite mug—the one with ‘UNT’ emblazoned on the front, C-shaped handle effectively completing the curse word—were waiting for her. Rio helped her gently into a chair, and once she was settled, pushed the plate towards her.</p><p>Head in one hand, Agatha eyed the toast suspiciously. “You poison this?”</p><p>“If I was going to poison you, I would’ve picked the tea. <em> Wayyy </em> easier to hide it in liquid.” She nudged the mug across the table, too. “Only one way to find out.”</p><p>Picking up the toast, Agatha took a bite, chewing and chewing until it was mush in her mouth. Swallowing tenderly, she took a sip of tea, the warmth washing over her. It was tangy, spicy almost—ginger, she realised. It felt like fucking heaven on her throat, rubbed raw from all the retching.</p><p>As if she could read Agatha’s mind, Rio glanced down at the mug. “Good for an upset stomach.”</p><p>She took another gulp. “Did Doctor Google tell you that, too?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio mused. “Speaking of, though—you should probably call your doctor, just get checked out.” She stared at her from across the table, expression heavy with concern.</p><p>Agatha cast her eyes downward, not ready to make eye contact—to face the sympathy that was written all over Rio’s face. </p><p>“Mmm. These kind of symptoms are meant to let up soon. I’m 12 weeks now.”</p><p>“Still, it wouldn’t hurt to check, right?” Rio pressed.</p><p>No doubt thanks to the carbs Rio had forced her to ingest, Agatha could feel her fight returning. She looked back up at Rio and tilted her chin in defiance.</p><p>“Forgive me if I don’t want to deal with some quack poking around in my vagina and droning on about my ‘advanced maternal age’ more than I have to.” </p><p>“Agatha, you literally just made me Google ‘is projectile vomiting in pregnancy normal?’ Forgive <em> me </em>if I don’t want the walls of the house to become a fucking Pollock painting because you were too stubborn to ask for help.” </p><p>“Why do you care? I could die tomorrow and it wouldn’t affect you.” </p><p>Something unreadable flickered over Rio’s face at Agatha’s statement. But when she spoke again, it was with the same jokey charm. “If you died tomorrow, I’d be homeless. So I think it’s okay for me to be a little invested in your wellbeing.” </p><p>Agatha pursed her lips into her tea, grappling with whether to give Rio the satisfaction of making an appointment or not. “Fine,” she eventually sighed, “I’ll call my doctor. But I’m <em> not </em>going there in person—just a phone call.” </p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio replied, the self-satisfaction only mildly evident in her expression. “Thank you.”</p><p>Silence stretched between the two of them as Agatha took her final, half-hearted bites of toast, washing them down with tea. She could feel Rio looking at her as she ate—not monitoring or pitying, just watching. Letting her be exactly as she was in this moment, casting no judgment on her tangled hair and translucent skin.</p><p>It felt vulnerable, but not uncomfortably so, the way it might have before Rio had wrapped her arms around her or cupped her face as if she was something precious. </p><p>Here this woman was giving so much of herself to everyone around her, blindly seeing the good in people—in Agatha—even when they objectively treated her like shit. </p><p>Actually, Agatha couldn’t speak for how Rio treated other people… but if the way she simply rolled with her too-hard punches was anything to go by, she suspected it was more of the same. Kind. Gracious. <em> Open</em>. </p><p>Rio was so unafraid of being herself, of being <em> seen</em>—and Agatha had no idea what that was like. Maybe that was what inspired her to say what she said next, the honesty flowing out of her of its own accord, not dissimilarly to her puke earlier.</p><p>“I’m sorry for being such a cunt to live with,” Agatha murmured, deftly avoiding Rio’s gaze again. “I’m sure it hasn’t been easy for you.”</p><p>Oddly, it didn’t make her feel anywhere near as disgusting as the vomiting—it just felt like a relief. Another slight easing of the uncomfortable tension that had begun to build between them now that all of Agatha’s attention wasn’t directed towards shutting Rio out completely. </p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle,” Rio replied. “You’re not as bad a roommate as you think. You just have very… specific routines. But I don’t mind them,” she shrugged.</p><p>“Still, I– I’m sorry. I don’t say that a lot, so don’t assume it’s an empty apology. And consider yourself lucky,” she looked up at Rio with a smirk. “Some people will never know the privilege of hearing those words from me.”</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek. “Guess I must be special, then.” </p><p>And although she couldn’t put her finger on why or how, Agatha was beginning to think that perhaps she was.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>While most of the dreams that featured the cruel spectre of her mother took place in Agatha’s childhood home, this time, inexplicably, she was running down the streets of Williamsburg. </p><p>She could hear her feet slapping against the sizzling-hot pavement, feel a light breeze that wasn’t strong enough to cool the summer heat rustling through the trees and tangling her hair. Her breath came in short gasps and a fire was building beneath her ribcage from the exertion.</p><p>Evanora was screaming after her, but she wouldn’t—couldn’t—turn around. </p><p>“Agatha!” Her mother’s voice was as clear as day; had lost none of its derision in the almost-five years since she’d heard it.</p><p>Still, something flared in her chest at the sound. Not love, but <em> obligation</em>. Duty. It pulled her under like a riptide at the beach, gripping her legs with unforeseen force as it tried to topple her.</p><p>Fighting the urge to turn around and kneel at her mother’s feet, she kept running. Down familiar sidewalks, by the bodega where she always used to go when she’d first moved into her apartment, past the entrance to the subway. She felt frantic, uncontrollable, like a whirling dervish as she skirted around faceless people with dogs on leashes and kids playing in sprinklers. </p><p>Agatha glanced down at the pavement as she ran, heat radiating off it in oily waves. Suddenly, it seemed a lot less solid, the cracks rising and falling around her feet. She blinked, looking back up to quell her dizziness, and found herself racing past the same bodega from a block ago. </p><p><em> What the fuck was happening? </em></p><p>Her mother’s voice boomed in her ears again, angrier this time. Agatha had lost all sense of what she was saying, instead focusing only on getting as far, far away from her as possible.</p><p>So she did the only thing that made any sense—she kept running. </p><p>Finally, somehow, she reached the heavy glass front door that signalled she was safe. She burst through the entrance to her apartment building and bolted to the stairwell, no time to wait for the slow creak of the elevator. Everything around her was blurry, morphing into indecipherable shapes and colours that made her eyes water. </p><p>Behind her, she could still hear Evanora’s nonsensical screaming. Her words were clearer again. “Come back here you wicked girl!” her disembodied voice bellowed. “You can’t outrun me!” </p><p>Agatha took the stairs two at a time, chest heaving, passing one floor after another until she reached the sixth. Her heart hammered off-tempo as she raced down the hallway and flung open her front door.</p><p>And there, standing simply in a t-shirt and jeans, was Rio. </p><p>She looked as if she had been waiting for her, brown eyes soft and knowing. As everything else blurred together, Rio looked impossibly <em> solid </em>—a port in the storm that was raging around her. </p><p>Agatha fixed her eyes on Rio, blinking rapidly, unsure of what to do. She took the woman before her in, revelling in the realness of her—of Rio’s collarbone, the sleeve of tattoos on her forearm, the freckle on her temple. She tried to speak, to explain or plead or <em> scream</em>, but nothing came out.</p><p>Rio tilted her head at Agatha wordlessly, then reached for her shoulders and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>Agatha melted into her strong embrace without a fight. She couldn’t hear Evanora’s deranged yells and taunts anymore—just her own ragged breathing as she buried her face in Rio’s chest, inhaling the clean scent of her t-shirt and traces of her earthy perfume.</p><p>The hallway around her stopped distorting as they held one another. Rio’s breath was steady and even, and Agatha felt her own exhales slow to accommodate the rhythm, unintentionally tuning to Rio’s frequency. One of Rio’s hands began to rub slow circles on her back, as if trying to ground her there, to remind her of something. </p><p>Eventually, though, the pressure of being wrapped in Rio’s arms became too much. She needed to look at her. She pulled back from the space she’d occupied on Rio’s chest and blinked when she saw a wet patch on her shirt where her own face had been nestled. </p><p>Rio opened her mouth as if to say something, but before her words could reach Agatha, Evanora’s voice rang out again, cutting through the silence between them like a searing hot knife. “You were born evil, Agatha,” her voice taunted, “and in time, even she will see you for what you are.” </p><p>Eyes wide, Agatha staggered back, out of Rio’s hold. Rio extended a hand to reach for her, but it was too late—Agatha was falling backward, the room pitching and dimming. Rio’s fingertips grazed against her own in a final, futile plea before the darkness enveloped her completely.</p><p>She jolted awake from the dream, twisted onto her side with the sheets clutched in one hand and the other bracing herself against her pillow. The harsh sunlight left her head spinning, and her entire face ached as if it had been screwed up in her sleep. </p><p>She blinked, taking in the familiarity of her bedroom—the sagging armchair in the corner, the pile of unread books that lived on one nightstand. It wasn’t real. She was safe, in her own home, and her mother was six feet under in a New Jersey cemetery like she had been for half a decade.</p><p>Still, parts of the dream felt troublingly indistinguishable from reality. The visceral fear of hearing her mother’s voice again, even if it was just in her head. How sore her body felt, whether it was from running miles through Brooklyn or sleeping in an uncomfortable position. Rio’s arms wrapped around her securely, the same way they had been yesterday.</p><p>And the way Rio had looked at her—the way her expression had stayed calm and open, even as her mother screamed everything she hated about Agatha, her own daughter, into the void. </p><p>Pulse still thumping in her ears, she sat up too quickly. The sheets clung to her damp skin—fuck, she was practically dripping with sweat. The air conditioning had turned itself off in the night, one of the downsides of the old, clunky unit she’d been asking Ralph to replace for forever.</p><p>Throwing the sheet off her, Agatha rose to her feet and grabbed her robe. <em> Fuck this shit</em>, she thought. <em> Fuck her mother for trying to haunt her from beyond the grave. Fuck Ralph for leaving. Fuck Rio for being so goddamn nice when she hadn’t asked her to. Fuck her pregnancy symptoms for always sending her down an emotional rabbit hole.  </em></p><p>Her limbs felt itchy and her robe, too tight. She needed to move, lest she settle in this moment for too long and begin to analyse what it all meant. </p><p>Agatha gathered her clothes and padded into the bathroom, where the scalding hot water of the shower was waiting—ready to burn every last inch of her mother, and the raw, too-real feeling of her tears spilling onto Rio’s chest, from her memory.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>By the time Agatha emerged from the shower, Rio had already left for work. The day dragged on as she tried everything to avoid being left alone with her thoughts: a new Netflix show. Endless cups of ginger tea. A shameful attempt at rearranging the kitchen cupboards. When Rio returned that evening, Agatha was already tucked up in bed, door locked in a feeble attempt to shut off the outside world. </p><p>Mercifully, that night’s sleep was dreamless. </p><p>Normalcy crept back in over the days that followed—if you could call her new reality ‘normal’. Rio floated around the apartment when she was home, making jokes about ‘vomit-gate’ while Agatha chuckled along hollowly, smile never reaching her eyes.</p><p>By Tuesday night, a new antagonist in Agatha’s life had emerged—because clearly, she wasn’t permitted more than a day or two of peace. First it had been Rio, then the morning sickness, and finally, her dreams. With all three on their way to reaching a resolution (the vomiting thanks to a prescription from her doctor), the universe was switching tack. </p><p>Now, it was her novel keeping her awake at night. She’d been stuck on the same paragraph for god knows how long, writing and deleting and rewriting in an endless loop.</p><p>She wondered if it was too late to pick a different career. Something that didn’t require any brainpower. Something she could do horizontal. </p><p>“What’s it about?”</p><p>Agatha startled, dropping the pen she was holding. It rolled along the hardwoods and towards the kitchen, where Rio was standing, looking at her curiously. She bent to pick it up, walking over to hand it to Agatha before dropping into the armchair across from the sofa.</p><p>“What’s what about?” Agatha wrinkled her nose, confused by Rio’s question. She looked down at the mess of papers on her lap; the laptop half-open beside her. “Oh, you mean my book?”</p><p>Rio nodded expectantly. </p><p>Agatha blew a raspberry, running a hand through her hair. “I actually don’t fucking know at this point,” she admitted. “It’s meant to be a ‘found family’ kinda thing. The main character’s mom dies, so she goes back to her hometown to figure out the estate, and ends up falling back into all these old patterns and relationships from the last time she was there. But I’m—” she trailed off, pondering how to explain her mental block. “Struggling. Too much of my own shit going on, not enough room for another person’s.” </p><p>“Isn’t that what writers do?” Rio questioned. “Use their own experiences in their stories?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, contemplating this. “I guess some do,” she agreed, giving Rio the point. “But not me. I prefer to keep my life and my writing separate.” </p><p>Rio’s lips twisted in contemplation. “Maybe you should try it?” she suggested. “Could get you past this creative constipation thing you’ve got going on.” </p><p>Agatha snorted, unable to help herself. Creative constipation was a clever way to put it, she’d give her that. “I don’t think so.” </p><p>Rio hummed thoughtfully but took the hint, moving on. “There any romance in it?” She wiggled her eyebrows at Agatha suggestively. </p><p>"<em>No</em>," Agatha rolled her eyes back at her. “Don’t tell me you’re one of those girls who only reads faerie smut or something equally as horrifying,” she added, judgment on full display. She meant no shade to the romantasy authors of the world—well, maybe she did—but she knew overhyped, overwritten drivel when she read it. </p><p>“Faerie smut? No,” Rio reassured her emphatically. “But I’ve been known to pick up a sapphic romance or two. A girl’s gotta get her kicks from somewhere, if you know what I mean.” </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure you have no issues in that department,” Agatha scoffed. There was no chance Rio’s only way of blowing off steam was reading erotic fiction. She was charming, funny, and objectively hot—Agatha bet women fawned over her the second she walked into any bar in New York. </p><p>Rio let out a minuscule huff of air, not quite a chuckle, but a private reaction that Agatha couldn’t decipher.</p><p>“Speaking of,” Agatha continued, taking in Rio’s outfit for the first time—tight jeans, a halter-neck top, and the leather jacket she’d slung over the back of the armchair. “Got a hot date?” she asked, aiming for casual. The last thing she wanted was Rio to launch into a story about some new woman she was dating—or worse, try to drag her into a chat about their respective sex lives, like a bad <em> Sex and the City </em>rerun. </p><p>“Oh, no,” she brushed off Agatha’s assumption breezily. “I’m just going home for dinner.” </p><p>Rio stood, walking to the kitchen counter where she began piling items into her bag. She had colonised a whole corner of the bench, but Agatha was beyond the point of saying anything. Call it their truce, or call it flat-out not having the energy to protest, you could take your pick.</p><p>Rio’s words jiggled something loose in Agatha’s brain as they settled. “Home?” she echoed.</p><p>She stifled her frown: wasn’t <em> this </em> her home now? It had only been a few weeks, but it felt like they’d found a rhythm. Getting there hadn’t exactly been easy, but Agatha was <em> trying</em>—trying to be nicer, trying to keep her own emotional overflow from splashing onto Rio. </p><p>So surely this couldn’t be it. Was Rio… leaving? Already?</p><p>Before Agatha could probe further, Rio turned back around and corrected herself. “Force of habit—sorry. To my foster mom’s place.” </p><p><em> Foster mom,</em> Agatha exhaled quietly, hoping the relief wasn’t written all over her face. While she was admittedly happy Rio wasn’t moving out as swiftly as she’d moved in—the idea of finding <em> another </em>roommate made her feel physically ill—it dawned on her that there was so much about Rio she’d avoided asking in her bid for compartmentalisation. </p><p><em> God forbid someone else has problems</em>, she thought wryly. </p><p>“Is that where you were living before you moved in here?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah.” </p><p>“Why’d you move out? I don’t think I ever asked you that.”</p><p>Rio dropped her bag on one of the kitchen stools and ambled back over, stretching her hands above her head as she slipped into the armchair. “Well, I’d been living with Lilia since I was, like, 15,” she started. “It was good, comfortable—just the two of us.” </p><p>“Her and I have had our moments over the years, of course. But no matter how much we bicker, it’s all love. Lilia and Alice are the only family I really have.” </p><p>Rio paused, a quick snag in the story, and Agatha blinked, catching up to her. She hadn’t known Rio long, but the idea of her having no one else pulled at something in her chest. </p><p>Leaving no time for Agatha to mentally pick it apart, Rio continued.</p><p>“Anyway, Lilia mentioned to me that she wanted to start dating again, and <em> worse</em>, she thought I should too,” she grinned wryly, no trace of whatever emotion had surfaced a second ago left. “The idea of having to coordinate sleepovers with a 65-year-old didn’t really sound that appealing to me. It was enough to send me running to Craigslist.” </p><p>“Makes sense,” Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed. “I figured 31 was as good an age as any to finally have some space of my own. Some independence. And then I saw your ad.”</p><p><em> Huh. She made it sound so simple. Like it was the easiest decision in the world</em>, Agatha thought. </p><p>She was quiet for a second, mulling over Rio’s response in her mind. There were so many things that had gone unsaid between them—yet Rio hadn’t thought twice about breaking off another little piece of herself and handing it to Agatha, palm outstretched and waiting. </p><p>Part of her wanted to snatch it and beg for more. Another wanted to close her own fist over Rio’s and say <em> no, take it back, it’s too much for me</em>.</p><p>Agatha reached for a lock of hair that had escaped from behind her ear, twisting it around her finger. Her next question came before she could censor it: “Why’d you pick me?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head to the side, expression thoughtful. “I could say it was because the apartment is beautiful,” she mused, “but that wasn’t it.” </p><p>“So, what was it then?” </p><p>“I’m not sure,” Rio shrugged. “Maybe it was because you accused me of being a serial killer before we even met. Maybe it was the idea of living with a caustic pregnant lady who can’t keep down a meal,” she grinned. “Or maybe it was just… in the cards. Meant to happen this way.” </p><p>“Typical fate,” Agatha snorted. “She’s got a truly fucked up sense of humour.” </p><p>“Hey, speak for yourself,” Rio chided. “I happen to like tortured novelists who label their tupperware for fun.”</p><p>“It’s efficient.”</p><p>“You keep telling yourself that, sweetheart,” Rio arched a brow, seeing straight through Agatha’s bullshit. Agatha felt her cheeks flame at the teasing nickname. <em>That was a new one. </em></p><p>“Oh, by the way,” Rio took advantage of her silence, jumping up from her perch. “I wanted to ask if it’s okay for me to have a couple friends over for dinner this week. Alice,” she reminded her, “she’s got a new girlfriend and she wants me to meet her. Thought I could cook for them.”</p><p>Agatha thought it over for a second, but it surprised her how easily her answer came. “Sure,” she nodded. </p><p>“Really?” Rio questioned. “No fine print for me to read over before I make a mess of your kitchen?”</p><p>“No fine print,” Agatha rolled her eyes. “And it’s your kitchen, too. Just make sure it’s fucking spotless when you’re done.” </p><p>“Yes, sergeant,” she raised her hand in a salute. “You’re welcome to join us, if you want. I don’t know what I’m gonna make yet, but Alice is good company, and if her constant text messages about this new girl are anything to go off, she’s <em> the nicest, coolest, funniest human ever</em>,” Rio mocked, the glimmer of a grin on her face betraying that she thought it was cute rather than nauseating. </p><p>While the idea of sharing a meal with other humans actually kinda sounded nice to Agatha—who, when she could be bothered to eat dinner that wasn’t from a packet, did so alone slumped on the couch—fourth-wheeling with Rio and her friends felt like a step too far.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Agatha hesitated. “This novel is kicking my ass, and I’m like a week away from a deadline. My agent would kill me if she knew I was wasting even a second.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted into a frown. “Surely one night off isn’t going to derail your progress. You’re glued to that screen every time I see you,” she protested. “Your ‘not a love story’ can wait.” </p><p>“I can’t, Rio.” She hoped the finality was clear. </p><p>Rio just shrugged and walked back over to the kitchen, retrieving her bag from the stool. </p><p>“Suit yourself,” she ceded. “But if you change your mind, I’ve been told my cooking is <em> mind-blowing</em>.” </p><p>Agatha didn’t take the bait—she couldn’t. “Have fun at your mom’s place,” she said, waving at Rio as she unlocked the door and disappeared into the hallway.</p><p>Once she could no longer hear the soft sound of Rio’s footsteps, she turned her attention back to her novel, grumbling. “<em>Definitely </em> not a love story.” </p><p align="center">———</p><p>That Friday afternoon, Rio texted Agatha to remind her that Alice and her girlfriend were coming over for dinner. She read it and promptly prepared for a night spent holed up in her bedroom, working on her book—ready-meal in the freezer, noise-cancelling headphones fully charged. </p><p>She’d been slumped over her desk all day, her main characters giving her a hard time. They just wouldn’t cooperate. She couldn’t figure out where the story wanted to go, or what the protagonist’s motivations were, and everything felt <em> flat</em>. </p><p>Maybe Rio was right—maybe she should try using some of her own experiences to inform the story. The main character wasn’t dissimilar from Agatha herself. Nicer, sure, and Agatha had barely bothered to attend her mother’s funeral when she died, let alone move back to her hometown and pack up all her shit. But there were parallels, and perhaps she could use them to her advantage.</p><p>Her mind began to whir with the possibilities, feeling more motivated to write than she had for weeks. She could make her character’s relationship with her dead mother more fraught, more complex—maybe that would add the emotional gravity she’d been missing up ‘til now. </p><p>Before that, though, she needed to eat and make herself scarce. This was Rio’s night with her friends, and they didn’t need her there, polluting the conversation with uncomfortable small talk or boring comments about pregnancy.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen to heat up her food, a scent from heaven overwhelmed her—sweet and savoury, rich with spices. “Holy shit, that smells good,” Agatha breathed, a knee-jerk reaction to the olfactory high. </p><p>Rio was standing at the stove, stirring a pot. Tearing her focus away from whatever she was cooking, she looked up at Agatha with a smirk. “Told you.” </p><p>Agatha’s belly rumbled. <em> Damn kid, making her hungry all the time</em>. “What is it?” she asked, opening the door to the microwave and throwing in her frozen meal. </p><p>“Pastelón,” Rio replied, the Spanish flowing off her tongue. “It’s kinda like Puerto Rican lasagne. My abuela’s recipe.” </p><p>Agatha noticed something soft cross Rio’s features as she mentioned her grandmother. She’d never heard her talk about a family member so directly, and while the thought of Rio and her abuela together warmed her from the inside, what she’d said earlier about Alice and Lilia hinted at something heavier.</p><p>“Sure you don’t want to join us?” Rio continued. “I’ve made more than enough.” </p><p>“While it smells incredible, I’ve really got to keep writing. I think I’m finally making some headway,” Agatha hesitated. “And you should enjoy your time with your friends.” </p><p>Rio nodded, her smile unusually small and careful—like she was trying not to push. “They’ll be here any minute.” </p><p>“Have fun,” Agatha nodded, ignoring the burn in her fingers as she pulled the aluminium tray of food from the microwave, steam billowing from the top. She retreated, leaving Rio standing alone in the kitchen, and strode back to the safety of her room. </p><p>A few minutes passed before a knock sounded at the door. Low murmurs began to fill the space, dulled by the barrier of her bedroom door—a laugh here, a mutter there.</p><p>Agatha had just swallowed her first pitiful forkful of lukewarm mush when she heard a familiar voice. <em> She knew that fucking voice.  </em></p><p>It was unmistakable—crisp, commanding, deeply smug. The same voice that’d berated her over Zoom calls, coaxed her through deadlines, and once, barked at a publicist so fiercely they’d both practically wet their pants laughing. </p><p><em> What the hell was she doing here now, of all times? </em></p><p>Flinging open her bedroom door, Agatha bolted down the hall, making no effort to change out of her rumpled loungewear or fix the hair she’d shoved into a messy bun. </p><p>When she burst into the living room a few seconds later, she was sitting nestled into Alice’s side, their hands loosely linked. Agatha’s eyes boggled at the sight of her. She’d never invited her here, not once—a careful separation of church and state that had now been corrupted in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Confusion and irritation bubbled inside her, threatening to breach the surface as she spoke.</p><p>“Jen?”</p>

<p>Jen’s face twisted into a frown to rival Agatha’s confused expression. </p><p>“Agatha?” she asked incredulously. Rio and Alice followed suit, brows crumpling in tandem. If it had been any other time, Agatha would’ve found the synchronicity hilarious—but right now, all she wanted was an explanation as to why her fucking literary agent was perched on her sofa, drinking out of one of her wine glasses like she paid rent on the place.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fell to the hand that was interlocked with Alice’s, the pieces falling into place far too slowly. <em> Jen was Alice’s girlfriend?  </em></p><p>Her brain stalled momentarily, catching up to the scene playing out in front of her. This was weird—a cosmic coincidence she was being forced to endure. But after weeks and weeks of being poked and prodded by the universe, what was one more plot twist? </p><p>She looked pointedly at Jen and Alice’s clasped hands again, raising an eyebrow before levelling Jen with a glare.</p><p>“I am <em> so </em> fucking confused right now,” Rio broke the silence. </p><p>Alice nodded. “Me too, dude. Can one of you explain what’s happening before we all self-combust from anticipation?” She looked at Jen. “Babe?” </p><p>Jen, for perhaps the first time in her life, was quiet. Agatha supposed she’d have to take one for the team. </p><p>“Jennifer here is a literary agent,” she explained, sighing. “<em>My </em>literary agent.”</p><p>“So… you two know each other?” Alice prompted. </p><p>“If having to read her nagging text messages and emails every day of my life is ‘knowing each other’, then yes, we do,” Agatha snapped, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Jen’s wide-eyed surprise was gone in an instant. “I wouldn’t have to nag you if you ever met your deadlines, Harkness.” </p><p>They kept staring at each other for a minute, and Agatha was sure she could feel Rio and Alice holding their breath—no doubt wondering what the fuck they’d gotten themselves into. </p><p>Before anyone could say anything, Jen’s cackle of laughter cut through the room like lightning. Agatha quickly followed suit, catching the twinkle in Jen’s eye. Her agent got up from where she was sitting on the couch, unhooking her hand from Alice’s, and gave Agatha a one-armed hug.</p><p>“Eww,” Agatha protested, although she leaned into the quick display of affection. “I thought we shared a mutual hatred for physical contact.” </p><p>Jen pulled back and looked at her knowingly. While most people would assume they despised one another from the way they interacted, after Wanda, Jen was the closest thing Agatha had to a friend. They didn’t spend much time together outside of work, but Jen had borne witness to some of Agatha’s biggest milestones—her first book deal, her first royalties check, her first glowing review. </p><p>She’d also been on the receiving end of many a furious phone call or sharp-tongued voice note. As colleagues, they were perfect for one another—Jen didn’t take shit from anyone, especially Agatha, and she had no problem handing it back to her when warranted. </p><p>“Hang on,” Agatha pointed a finger at Jen. “This still doesn’t explain why you’re eating charcuterie on my couch. I didn’t know you were dating someone.” </p><p>“Bitch, you only ever tell me things when it affects your writing. You don’t get to be mad at me,” Jen scoffed. <em> Well, she had a point</em>. </p><p>Rio patted the spot beside her on the sofa, motioning for Agatha to sit down. She crossed her arms, unsure whether to stay or retreat back to safety. She’d wanted to leave Rio to it, to give her space to spend time with her friends—but that was before a freaky twist of fate had set her two worlds into a headlong collision.</p><p>The least she could do was reclaim a seat on her own couch, so she stepped over Rio’s outstretched legs one at a time and plonked herself down on the soft velvet. </p><p>“So, let me get this straight. You guys work together,” Rio gestured at Jen and Agatha, “and Jen’s the reason you couldn’t have dinner with us tonight, right?” </p><p>Jen’s jaw dropped dramatically. “You used me as an excuse?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha corrected, pursing her lips. “I used the <em> book </em> as an excuse. Next chapters are due Monday. I just mentioned you’d be on my ass about it.” </p><p>“Well, consider your deadline extended.” </p><p>“And since when did you become my publisher, Jennifer?” Agatha challenged. </p><p>“Since I always set your deadlines a week earlier than they actually are because you have a track record of being embarrassingly late,” Jen smiled at her sweetly, batting her lashes.</p><p>“Oh, boy,” Alice exhaled. Although Agatha and Jen knew their bickering was just poorly disguised banter, Alice clearly didn’t. She’d stiffened slightly, her easy confidence tinged with concern. </p><p>Jen snaked her hand back over to Alice’s and gave it a reassuring squeeze, while Agatha. She looked at Jen, silently communicating: they’d have to keep their claws retracted around Alice, at least for now.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, was gloating. “Well, you have no excuse not to hang out with us now,” she said with a smirk. “And eat my fucking <em> brilliant </em>food, might I add.” </p><p>The divine smell from earlier had filled the entire apartment now, giving it a warm, homey feel, and Agatha had only managed one bite of frozen fried rice before Jen’s voice rudely pulled her from her bedroom. So, yeah—she was hungry. But that didn’t mean she wasn’t going to give Rio shit for her bravado first.</p><p>“Always so humble,” Agatha muttered, the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Rio just chuckled and shook her head. </p><p>At that, Jen and Alice exchanged a glance, quick and unreadable. Agatha narrowed her eyes, catching it as it landed. Suddenly she felt all-too-aware of her position on the couch, casually close to Rio, their thighs almost touching. </p><p>“What?” she asked sharply, looking between Jen and Alice.</p><p>“Nothing,” Jen dismissed airily.</p><p>“I’m gonna set the table,” Rio jumped up gleefully, skipping over to the kitchen and busying herself in the cutlery drawer.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were seated around Agatha’s dining table, which was decorated with a mishmash of plates and bowls—unmistakably Rio’s doing. Agatha had bit her tongue at her selection, not wanting to sour the mood by replacing them with the matching sets. </p><p>Rio had made a fuss of serving everyone oversized helpings of steaming pastelón, flitting around the table like the perfect hostess. Once they’d taken their first bites, she’d probed everyone for a review, and now, she was polishing off her own plate, smug and drunk on compliments. </p><p>“Wine, Agatha?” Alice offered, holding out the bottle of red they were working through.</p><p>“She’s pregnant,” Jen interjected, not giving Agatha time to come up with a clever excuse. </p><p>“Oh!” Alice exclaimed. “Congratulations.” </p><p>Agatha felt her smile tighten as she shot Jen daggers from across the table. “Thank you, Alice.” </p><p>“I’m surprised Rio hasn’t told you,” Agatha continued, lifting a glass of sparkling water to her lips. “It’s been very <em> Rosemary’s Baby </em> over here.”</p><p>“Kid trying to kill you?” </p><p>“Something like that,” she agreed, eyes flicking over to Rio, who gave her an amused smile. It was clear they were both thinking about vomit-gate—enough time had passed for Agatha to find it funny now, too, and it had become sort of an inside joke between them. </p><p>“So, how do you and Rio know each other, Alice?” Agatha changed the topic, although her eyes were still on Rio.</p><p>“We met playing basketball, actually,” Alice said through a mouthful of pastelón. Next to her, Jen leaned in a little closer, intrigued to learn more about her girlfriend by way of her best friend.</p><p>“Back when we were teenagers,” Rio added, giving Alice enough time to swallow. “I used to sneak out of my foster homes and go down to the courts to play pickup—” </p><p>“—and smoke way too much weed,” Alice cut back in with a grin. </p><p>“Correct,” Rio laughed. “We bonded over basketball, good blunts, and our fucked-up home lives.” </p><p>“Best friends ever since,” Alice finished.</p><p><em> God, they were in sync. </em> It was nice to see Rio like this—so at ease with someone as they spoke in shorthand, fluent in each other’s histories. </p><p>She felt a pang of gratitude towards Alice for being there for Rio at what had probably been a dark time in her life, if the narrative she’d pieced together in her head was anything to go by. </p><p>“I didn’t know you played basketball,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Oh, Rio didn’t just <em> play </em> basketball. She fucking <em> killed it </em>at basketball. If it weren’t for her knee, she’d be in the WNBA by now,” Alice replied, clearly proud.</p><p>Agatha let out a low whistle. “That good, huh? What happened to your knee?” </p><p>“Tore my ACL junior year,” Rio said. “And that was the end of my college career. Well, the sports part, at least.” </p><p>“And then she became the team masseuse,” Alice added. “Which was the best gig a twenty-year-old lesbian could ask for.” </p><p><em> Aha </em> , Agatha thought, another sliver of Rio’s backstory clicking into place. <em> So that’s how the whole massage thing came about</em>. Across the table, Jen raised an eyebrow but said nothing, swirling her wine like she was saving her commentary for later.</p><p>The conversation drifted from sports to friendship to dating as they ate their dinner and everyone but Agatha sipped their wine, loosening up with each glass.</p><p>Before she knew it, the three of them were howling with laughter over a story about one of Alice’s exes—something about a pet kitten and ruined lingerie that was undoubtedly funny, but full of subtext she couldn’t quite catch and lingo that didn’t land.</p><p>Agatha laughed along, trying to follow, but the rhythm of their jokes made her feel out of step. Like she was knocking at a door that wouldn’t open, or starting a movie halfway through. Her gaze drifted up from where it had been fixated on her absurdly clean plate—Rio hadn’t been lying when she said she was a good cook—and found her roommate’s. </p><p>Rio’s eyes were already on her, like she could sense Agatha’s discomfort without words.</p><p>“Okay, lesbians,” Rio chided, “let’s give the poor straight woman a break from all the dyke drama.” She gestured in Agatha’s direction, fixing her with an apologetic smile.</p><p>Jen snorted into her wine. “Agatha’s not straight,” she said, casual but certain.</p><p>The seconds that followed felt oddly cinematic to Agatha. Time seemed to slow down, but her heart rate climbed, her hands dampening with sweat. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio’s fingers still where they’d been drumming against her wine glass.</p><p>
<em> What was Jen talking about? She’d always been straight—had never given Jen or anyone a reason to think otherwise. Hadn’t she?  </em>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to look up at Rio, gauge her reaction to Jen’s words, but the weight of what had been said kept her gaze fixed firmly on the table. Alice shifted beside her, catching the change in the air.</p><p>Though her mind was still racing, Agatha knew she had to speak, to prove Jen wrong before her words gained too much power. “Yes I am,” she stared at Jen, bewildered. She could feel a divot forming in her brow as the clink of cutlery against plates around her stopped. </p><p>Both Rio and Alice were watching them now, and the embarrassment of being put on display like this—of her identity being dangled in front of her—set Agatha’s cheeks aflame.</p><p>Jen continued, unflinching. “I mean, I know you were in a straight relationship, sure.” She waved a hand like that part was irrelevant; a mere footnote. “But you’re still queer.”</p><p>“No, I’m not.” Agatha’s voice was firm and final. </p><p>They’d never spoken about her sexuality before, but Agatha didn’t think they’d needed to. She’d been with Ralph the entire time they’d known each other, and she had never expressed any desire to be with another woman. The comment was so out of left field, she wasn’t even sure they were playing the same game anymore. </p><p>Jen tilted her head, confused. “You’re telling me you’re really straight?”</p><p>“Why is this news to you, Jennifer?” Agatha snapped. </p><p>Jen shook her head like she couldn’t comprehend what she was hearing. “But your books have so much lesbian subtext.” </p><p>Agatha made a face at that. <em> Did they? No—they definitely didn’t. She would know if her own writing, her own life’s work, was masking some kind of hidden meaning. </em>“I literally do not know what you’re talking about,” she shot back.</p><p>Jen huffed out a harsh laugh, the tension in the room still rising. “Come on, Agatha. The protagonist picks her best friend over her boyfriend and they run away to fucking Vermont or something? That one was a <em> New York Times </em> bestseller,” she nudged Alice. </p><p>Alice just glanced awkwardly between Jen and Agatha, like she wasn’t sure whether to nod in agreement or stay the fuck out of it.</p><p>“All of your books are so<em> gay</em>,” Jen repeated. “I always thought it was like… a choice.”</p><p>Jen wasn’t backing down, and Agatha could feel the heat of being challenged rising in her body, creeping up her chest and into her throat. The back-and-forth nature of her relationship with Jen told her to stay and fight, that they could work things out like they always did—but she couldn’t resist the other urge that was pulling at her.</p><p>The switch flipped in Agatha’s brain: the one that was marked ‘self-preservation’ in big, red letters. <em> This isn’t worth the effort,</em> she thought callously. <em> Just more of Jen’s self-important bullshit.</em></p><p>And what did she know, anyway? It’s not like they were <em> actually </em> friends.</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t. Isn’t,” Agatha said coldly. She was shutting down now, too overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sudden turn of events to lean into her anger. Instead, she just wanted out. </p><p>She tore her eyes away from Jen, who was still feigning shock, and finally let herself look at the other two sitting at the table. Alice’s head was bobbing between her and Jen like a referee without a whistle, shoulders tight and wine abandoned on the table in front of her. </p><p>On the other hand, Rio just looked lost. Like she didn’t know how to help, or whose side she was supposed to be on. Her lips parted as if she was about to say something, exposing the tiny gap between her front teeth. </p><p>Before she could, Jen looked at Agatha again. Her expression had softened a little—maybe her conscience was finally catching up to her. But the alarm bells in Agatha’s head still blared, exit sign flashing like a beacon. </p><p>“Agatha, come on—I wasn’t trying to offend you. I just thought…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” she cut Jen off through gritted teeth. “Come to think of it, I’m tired. I’m going to bed.” She stood up from the table, the scrape of her chair across the hardwoods like punctuation in the otherwise-quiet room. </p><p>She didn’t even bother to clear her plate, nor offer to help. The conversation had taken a ridiculous turn, and she didn’t owe it another second of her time. </p><p>In lieu of saying something she would regret in the morning, Agatha ran a hand through her hair and began walking toward her bedroom, away from the chaotic fucking dinner party she hadn’t wanted to be a part of in the first place. She didn’t hazard a glance back at any of them, not wanting to see the obvious pity that was written all over their faces—especially not on Rio’s.</p><p>“Agatha, don’t do that,” Jen made a move to follow her, standing up from the table. “I didn’t know.” </p><p>She held up a hand to stop her. “Goodnight. I’ll email you on Monday, Jen.” </p><p align="center">———</p><p>“Do I give you lesbian vibes?” Agatha asked Billy bluntly, inspecting the ice cream that was currently dripping down his hand with a frown.</p><p>They were walking around Washington Square Park, throngs of people milling around them and the fountain bubbling away in the background. She’d texted her godson out of the blue to invite him on a walk, tearing him away from his summer plans under the guise of exploring the NYU campus. </p><p>His college decisions were hanging on the horizon, and while Agatha wouldn’t admit it, the idea of having one of her favourite people in the world live a little closer made her feel warm and fuzzy. </p><p>Well, in the ballpark of warm and fuzzy, at least. Maybe as close as a Harkness could actually get. </p><p>“Wh— what?” Billy stuttered, clearly caught off guard by her question—and if he knew what was good for him, choosing his next words very carefully. </p><p>Agatha didn’t blame him. </p><p>Since the dinner, she had been ignoring everything other than work—her phone, her feelings, and most importantly, Rio. Her roommate had tried to bridge the rift that had quickly developed between them, no thanks to Jen, but Agatha had shut right down. Luckily, Rio had taken the hint quickly, giving her some much-needed space.</p><p>Still, her mood had been erratic, a pendulum swinging between rage and confusion. She’d been on edge for days, and the only thing that could help even a fraction was <em> answers</em>. So forgive her for being a little abrupt. </p><p>“You heard me, Billy,” she repeated herself. “Me. Aunt Agatha. Gay vibes. Now.” </p><p>“No? I mean, well, <em> yes </em> , but—” Billy opened and closed his mouth like a fish. A droplet of pistachio landed with a soft <em> plop </em> on the sidewalk. </p><p>He took a steadying breath, and Agatha felt a small twinge of regret for putting her poor, sweet, gay godson in this position. But he was the only person she could ask. Rio was severely off-limits, and while she and Jen had texted and emailed since the other night, it had been distant and only about work.</p><p>Plus, Jen had already said her piece—unless it was a grovel-at-your-feet kind of apology, Agatha didn’t want to hear anything else.</p><p>So, she just stared coolly at him until he spoke again: “Do you <em> want </em> to give off lesbian vibes?”</p><p>“That’s an irrelevant question,” Agatha intoned. “Just tell me—yes or no.”</p><p>“Ughhhh,” he groaned in a way that only teenagers could. “I’m uncomfortable.” </p><p>“<em>You’re </em> uncomfortable,” Agatha barked out a laugh. “This is the first week I’ve been able to keep food down in over a month. Be thankful I’m not puking all over you. Now, where were we?” </p><p>“Okay, fine!” Billy exclaimed, his voice pitching up at least an octave. “Firstly, I want to say that there are really no such thing as lesbian vibes anymore, anyone can be gay or straight or identify however they want, and that has nothing to do with the way they look, or act, or—”</p><p>Agatha cut him off with a ‘hurry up’ motion, ice-blue eyes boring into his.</p><p>“But if I didn’t know you and I had to take a guess, I’d say… maybe?!” </p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha echoed flatly. This was a pointless study. Clearly the kid was either scared of what her reaction might be, or was trying to spare her feelings—and she hated both of those possibilities. </p><p>Still, she wasn’t going to back down now. They’d come this far. “Elaborate.” </p><p>“Well, you’re strong and authoritative. You don’t really give a shit about the male gaze—” Agatha cleared her throat at the curse word, but Billy just smiled sheepishly and went on. “—or what men think in general… and you wear a lot of suits, I guess. Like, on your book tours and stuff. So yeah—a little?” </p><p><em> Weak arguments</em>, she thought. <em> No conclusive evidence to speak of.  </em></p><p>“Anyway… why are you asking?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, the weight of having to explain what had happened pressing down on her chest. “Just something someone said to me the other day.” </p><p>Billy stopped mid-stroll, turning away from her to face the fountain in the middle of the park, looking out at it contemplatively. Agatha could sense he was gearing up to say something profound—the perils of having a therapist as a mother, she supposed—and she steeled herself for it, waiting. </p><p>“You know, when kids used to call me gay in middle school, Mom always told me to just ignore them. Said that it didn’t matter if I was gay or straight or whatever, just that I took the time to figure it out myself instead of letting other people decide who I was—who I am.” </p><p>Billy turned back and looked at her, something searching in his dark eyes. She suddenly felt ashamed for putting her emotional burden on a 17-year-old—although she had to give him credit. He was handling it surprisingly well.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, half at Billy and half to quell the thoughts that were now racing through her mind. So, she gave off gay vibes… maybe? That was confusing. <em> Another thing to add to the list</em>, she thought wryly. </p><p>“You’ve been therapised beyond repair,” Agatha remarked. “I should have a fucking word with your mother.”</p><p>“Stop deflecting,” Billy prodded, leaning in to shoulder-check her playfully. </p><p>“Ahh!” Agatha pulled back from his touch, pretending like she’d been burned. “Devil child!”</p><p>“I prefer ‘devil teen’, thank you very much.” </p><p>They kept walking around the fountain quietly, some of the tension diffused by the summer air, never long for this world when her godson was involved. But while they’d fallen into a comfortable silence, Agatha was still turning over Billy’s comments, trying to find the hidden implication she’d missed. It was jarring, realising other people had perceptions of you that were so different to the one you had of yourself.</p><p>After a few minutes, Billy opened his mouth to speak again, ice cream long gone. </p><p>“Aunt Agatha,” Billy started, tone tentative. “If you’re—” He seemed to stop and think for a second before deciding to press forward. “If you’re questioning who you are, you don’t need to decide today.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened. That wasn’t what this was. She wasn’t questioning anything, other than <em> why </em> everyone around her believed something about her that was so starkly, obviously <em> wrong </em>. </p><p>And yet the simple notion hit her like a brick. Ever since the dinner, she’d felt like her hand was being forced—like she had something to prove, even to herself. Like if she let the silence stretch out too long, someone else’s version of the story would win. The idea of just letting it swirl around for a little longer, of not jumping on the defense, hadn’t even occurred to her. </p><p>Billy continued. “I don’t think I really, truly knew I was gay until I met Eddie. And then it became like, painstakingly obvious once I couldn’t go five seconds without thinking about him,” he joked.</p><p>Agatha had to stifle a snort. The kid had been wearing crop tops since he was 13—the signs were there, and they’d all seen them. </p><p>But what if there just… weren’t any signs for some people? What if it wasn’t some intrinsic part of yourself you knew from day one, but rather, a thing that built over time? </p><p>And if it <em> did </em> build, then what was it building up to?</p><p>She shook her head and fixed Billy with a smile, flinging an arm around his shoulders in an attempt to lighten the mood and sidestep a conversation she wasn’t ready to continue. </p><p>“Alright, kid, that’s enough trauma dumping for today. We’ve gotta get back to my place before your mom comes to pick you up.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After a sweat-soaked subway ride, Agatha and Billy arrived back at the apartment. Her godson immediately collapsed on the couch while Agatha did a quick sweep to check if Rio was home. She wasn’t—probably at work, or college, or one of her many other activities—and it felt like a tiny mercy. She didn’t need surface-level small talk right now, not with the way the last few days had unfolded.</p><p>They’d been home for all of five minutes when a knock sounded at the door, and in came a flurry of red hair dressed in red shorts and a white tank top. </p><p>“Hey!” Wanda greeted, immediately enveloping Agatha in a rose-scented hug.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha mumbled into Wanda’s shoulder. “Please let me go before you flatten my windpipe. I’m breathing for two.”</p><p>“You’re so dramatic,” her best friend replied. She dropped her bag unceremoniously on the floor and reluctantly let go of Agatha.</p><p>“I know, it’s one of my best qualities,” Agatha snarked back. </p><p>“Hey, Mom,” Billy waved at Wanda from the couch. </p><p>“Hi sweetheart,” Wanda replied. “You okay if we stay a bit longer so I can catch up with your aunt?”</p><p>“Sure,” Billy shrugged her off and began playing with the TV remote. He flicked over to some Bravo monstrosity before directing his attention to his phone. How the youth could effortlessly switch between their big screens and their tiny screens, Agatha would never know.</p><p>“So, how are you?” Wanda asked, sliding into a stool at the kitchen island.</p><p>Agatha followed, dragging one out across from her. She rested her elbow on the bench, chin in hand. “Well, your son is turning into fucking Freud, but apart from that, I’m fine.”</p><p>Wanda ignored Agatha’s pointed comment and flipped her hair over her shoulder. “Morning sickness gone?” she pressed. </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha nodded. “There was a whole projectile vomiting incident, and after that, Rio made me call the doctor, so you’ll be glad to know my Abigail impressions are behind me.” Wanda looked at her blankly. “Horror movie reference,” she clarified. </p><p>“Sure,” Wanda blinked, as if she was just now processing what Agatha had said. “You said Rio made you call the doctor? Is she like, a nurse or something as well as being a plant whisperer?”</p><p>At the mention of plants, Agatha’s gaze drifted to the kitchen windowsill, where the purple-topped succulent now lived. <em> Still alive</em>, she observed vaguely. <em> Still growing</em>. </p><p>“No, she was just there when it happened,” she finally responded. “I think I scared her a little. There was a lot of panicked Googling involved.”</p><p>“The poor girl,” Wanda chuckled. “I bet she’s wondering what she signed up for, living with you.” </p><p>Agatha let out a humourless laugh. “Probably.”</p><p>That wasn’t true, though. The more of herself she exposed to Rio, the more she just… didn’t care. While she’d kind of accepted that Rio was unflappable, it still unnerved her a little. How easily she saw her, didn’t flinch or look away from her mess. </p><p>She wondered if Rio would still be her same open, unapologetic self now, after she’d observed Agatha at her coldest. </p><p>“I had dinner with her and her friends the other night,” Agatha dropped in, biting her lip. </p><p>“And?” Wanda raised a brow.</p><p>“I may have stormed out.”</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda’s exasperation came on cue. “What did I say about being nice?”</p><p>Agatha winced. “Umm, to try it? I did, Wanda, I promise.” She spread her arms wide in self-effacing acknowledgment. “It’s just not really in my nature.” </p><p>“Oh, shut up. What set you off?” </p><p>“There may have been some comments from Jen…” she trailed off. </p><p>Wanda clocked the name—Agatha didn’t have many friends, and work was her world, so she’d heard about Jen more than she would’ve liked. Mostly Agatha’s bitching when Jen was on her case about turning in pages on time or taking editor’s notes as law, rather than mere suggestions.</p><p>“Wait, Jen was here? At Rio’s dinner?” </p><p>“Yeah, she’s dating Rio’s best friend,” Agatha huffed out a laugh. “It’s a whole lesbian clusterfuck thing.”</p><p>“What did she say to you?”</p><p>“She may have insinuated that she thought I was… I don’t know, queer of some description.” Agatha traced over the veins of the marble countertop with an absent-minded finger.</p><p>“And that’s a bad thing because?” Wanda glanced over to where Billy was lounging on the couch, apparently deep in some text conversation, his fingers flying over the keys of his phone. Her gaze softened as it fell on him before returning to meet Agatha’s.</p><p>“It’s not a <em> bad </em> thing, Wanda, you know I don’t think that,” she reached for Wanda’s hand across the counter. “It’s just not who I am.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>Agatha pulled back and crossed her arms, a defensive reflex. “I don’t know, I just… <em>know</em>. How— how did you know?” she asked, voice rising a little too sharply. </p><p>“What, with Billy? Or myself?” </p><p>“Either or. Jesus fuck, what am I, surrounded by gay people?”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha,” Wanda nodded sagely. “You’re surrounded by gay people. We run the world.” </p><p>Agatha smacked her on the arm, hard. </p><p>“To answer your question,” Wanda’s lip twisted in contemplation. “I guess I didn’t really <em> know </em> until… college, maybe? There was this girl in my Psychology of Emotion and Motivation class. She was smart, funny, devastatingly charming,” she said, a dreamy look overtaking her features. </p><p>“I kept finding excuses to study with her. One day, in the library, she kissed me… and I realised what I’d been feeling was textbook gay panic. Pun intended,” Wanda chuckled. </p><p>“What happened to her?”</p><p>“I don’t know. We went on a couple dates and it fizzled out. I met Vision the next semester and the rest is suburban New Jersey legend. But she’s definitely my bisexual origin story.” </p><p>Agatha frowned. “How have I never heard this before? I’ve known you since I was like ten years old.” </p><p>“You never asked,” she shrugged. “I kinda assumed you didn’t want to know.” </p><p>Oh, <em> fuck. </em>That was never a nice thing to hear from your best friend, and it cut deeper than Agatha could’ve expected. How many things had she assumed, ignored, steamrolled just to avoid having hard conversations?</p><p>“Wanda—” Agatha said, her voice cracking on impact. “I always want to know. I should’ve asked.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression was free of judgment. “It’s okay,” she reassured her, reaching for Agatha’s hand again and squeezing it, tethering them together in the moment. “You’ve always had a lot of your own shit going on. It’s not like you haven’t been there for me when I’ve needed you the most. But now, you’ve gotta let <em> me </em> be there for <em> you </em>.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled deeply. Between this and her talk with Billy, she could feel a vulnerability hangover coming on.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said softly. It wasn’t true, though. She wasn’t fine, and the concept felt impossibly far from her reach. But she was determined to work her way back there, if not for her own sanity, but for the human that she’d be responsible for keeping alive in a matter of months. “I’m trying to be.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda ran her thumb over the back of Agatha’s hand. “Remember what I said to you on the phone, is all.”</p><p>“To not be such a bitch?” </p><p>“Well, yes, that,” Wanda laughed. “But also the part about not being alone. I know you’ve got a lot of thoughts rolling around in that head of yours, but don’t let this one slip loose.” She paused before continuing. “Have you talked to her since dinner?”</p><p>“To Jen? Please,” Agatha scoffed. “Only about work.” </p><p>Wanda looked at her pointedly. “To <em> Rio</em>, Agatha.”</p><p>“What do I need to talk to Rio about?” Agatha asked, bewildered.</p><p>“Literally anything,” Wanda replied, like it was obvious. “Normal shit. Who’s taking out the trash or emptying the dishwasher.” </p><p>Agatha rubbed a hand over her face as she shook her head, a non-verbal acknowledgement of her best friend’s fears. </p><p>Wanda sighed again, a deep exhale. “Just don’t shut her out. What happened with Jen isn’t her fault, but she’s probably feeling like it is right now.”</p><p>Agatha pondered this. She didn’t want that—didn’t want Rio to be caught in the crossfires of what had eventuated between her and Jen. But she didn’t know how to protect her from it without leaning in too close or saying something that she couldn’t take back. The instinctual need to deflect rather than face it head-on had won out again. </p><p>“Okay, okay,” Agatha protested, “enough therapy talk. Between you and him,” she jerked a finger towards Billy, “I’ve had my fair share of psychoanalysis for the year.”</p><p>Wanda took that as her sign to leave, standing up and stretching with a gentle smile thrown in Agatha’s direction. “Alright, kiddo,” she said, walking over to Billy and pulling an Airpod from one of his ears. He glared at her as she held it up to her own, listening to the tinny music. “Sabrina Carpenter?” she guessed. </p><p>Billy made a face as if to say, <em> you have no idea what you’re talking about</em>. “Tate McRae. She’s iconic.” The finality of his statement made it clear it was not up for debate.</p><p>“Well, you can listen to your icons in the car,” Wanda tossed the Airpod back at her son and waited. “It’s time to go. Your dad and Tommy are probably tearing the house apart looking for food.”</p><p>Billy stood, shoving his phone into his pocket, and walked over to where Agatha was still sitting on one of the kitchen stools. She rose to her feet and noticed that Billy had a good four inches on her. </p><p>The thought came thick and fast, before she could stop it: <em> Is this what motherhood was like? Watching your heart grow outside of your body, with no control over what happened to it? </em>She touched her stomach instinctively.</p><p>Billy leaned in to hug her and she returned it with all the sincerity in the world, grateful for the sweet, sensitive boy—no, <em> man</em>—in front of her. </p><p>“You’ll figure it out,” he whispered in her ear, and it sent goosebumps flying across her skin. Billy pulled back for one last ‘love you’, before he and Wanda disappeared out the door, ready to make the journey back to Westview.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had been tiptoeing around the apartment ever since the dinner party-gone-wrong, only acknowledging Rio in passing—like when they decided to make tea at the same time, or had to negotiate use of the TV.</p><p>She wasn’t avoiding <em> her.</em> Rio was resolutely not the problem. She was just avoiding having a conversation that she didn’t know how to broach, the idea sitting heavy in her gut like a stone. So much had happened in the last week that she could barely untangle it all: Jen’s accusations. Rio’s lost expression. Billy’s ‘maybe’. Wanda’s patience.</p><p>They blurred together in her mind like a stack of half-read books, none of them finished, the pages dog-eared and waiting for her to reopen them. But of course, she wouldn’t—not until she could put a name to how she felt.</p><p>And so the days passed, slow and shapeless. She’d barely left the apartment. What else was new.</p><p>Now, Sunday morning had rolled around like it always did, and the world outside seemed… cheerful. New York in summer was loud and bright, and once upon a time, Agatha had loved it. It had made her feel alive, like she was a part of something bigger than herself.</p><p>But as sunlight leaked across the floorboards of her bedroom, all she wanted to do was close the blinds and disappear.</p><p>See, she’d heard reports of the universe treating other people kindly. But that didn’t appear to be her lot in life.</p><p>“Agatha,” a knock came at her bedroom door, Rio’s voice filtering through. She ignored it and turned onto her side, pulling the covers over her head to block out the sunlight. <em> The fuck was she doing at her door on a Sunday morning? </em>She checked her watch and stifled a groan: 9am. </p><p>Rio’s voice came again, louder and more insistent this time: “Agatha!”</p><p>Her stomach twisted. Maybe Rio wanted to talk about dinner—about the silences that had begun to fill their apartment.</p><p>Sure, Agatha had debriefed with Wanda and Billy, and their kindness had helped, somewhat. But it had also left her spinning. Because now that the dust had settled, all she could see was how far she’d strayed from a version of herself that she could recognise. </p><p>She felt unmoored, nothing tethering her to the old Agatha, the one who hid behind sarcasm and would’ve rather jumped off a cliff than be vulnerable. It was like she’d been dropped at the start of an unfamiliar, winding road without a map—just a sneaking suspicion that wherever it led, she couldn’t turn around.</p><p>She stayed quiet for a second longer, willing Rio to walk away. But she didn’t hear her footsteps retreat.</p><p>“What?” Agatha eventually called out, tone clipped but muffled from beneath the duvet.</p><p>“Get up,” Rio replied. She sounded impatient, but there was no edge of confrontation in her voice. “You need to leave the apartment.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha hoped her one word responses would function as a deterrent. </p><p>“Because you’ve been moping in here for an entire week, and this weather is too good not to enjoy. When was the last time you saw sunlight?”</p><p>Oh, so that was it. <em> Ever the caretaker</em>, Agatha thought sullenly. Yeah, she’d been holed up in the apartment—but in her defence, she was making progress on her novel, and she knew that creativity was like lightning in a bottle. She’d planned to keep working all day, just in case writer’s block reared its ugly head again next week.</p><p>But, as had already proven the case at least once, Rio wasn’t the type to let Agatha’s stubbornness win, unless it was something trivial like how she did the dishes. She knew she had two options, neither of them appealing: put up a fight and be worn down eventually, or save herself the breath by going along with it—whatever <em> it </em> was.</p><p>And honestly? She was too tired to argue.</p><p>Reluctantly, she threw on a pair of pyjama shorts to go with her sleep shirt, and padded over to the door. She opened it a crack, and there was Rio in cutoffs and a t-shirt, looking at her with… were those puppy dog eyes?</p><p>Jesus, it was too early for that kind of emotional manipulation.</p><p>Agatha slipped out of the room and closed the door behind her, hiding the evidence—empty takeout containers, clothes that hadn’t been put away, and papers strewn over every surface—from view. She leaned against the door and folded her arms, summoning her best glare and fixing Rio with it. <em> This better be good</em>, it said. </p><p>“Good morning, sunshine,” Rio drawled, taking her in.</p><p>Agatha self-consciously brushed hair out of her face. “‘Good’ doesn’t even begin to describe it,” she replied sarcastically. </p><p>“So, I’m curious,” Rio continued, unbothered. “What does a perfect Sunday morning look like for Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“Huh?” She tilted her head. Clearly she was still waking up, because her verbal processing skills were sorely lacking.</p><p>“If you could do anything today—other than stay in bed,” Rio warned, preempting a retort, “what would you do?”</p><p>Agatha sighed in frustration, but Rio just kept looking at her, gaze pointed.</p><p>She mulled the question over for a minute. The desire to brush her off was overwhelming. But what was the alternative—wallowing in the dark for another eight hours? Even she had to admit that wasn’t productive.</p><p>“I guess I’d… maybe go to my favourite bookstore,” she finally said.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio nodded, like she was making a mental note. A small smile threatened her lips, like Agatha’s receptiveness pleased her. “Anything else?”</p><p>“Rio, why—” Agatha began, but Rio just held up a hand and motioned for her to keep going, immune to her protests. “Fine, I suppose I’d need to eat at some point. I’m fucking starving all the time now I can keep food down.” </p><p>“Somewhere specific?” Rio asked, pulling her phone from her pocket.</p><p>“There’s a bagel place near the bookstore I like.”</p><p>Rio handed her phone over to Agatha, open to Google Maps. Wordlessly, she typed in the name of her go-to spot for a BEC, and thrust the phone back at Rio when she was done. </p><p>“Okay, get dressed. We’re leaving in 20 minutes.”</p><p>“We? Don’t you have to work?” </p><p>“Nope,” Rio smirked. “Got the day off,” she said, sauntering back to her room. </p><p>24 minutes later—because yes, Rio <em> had </em> been counting—Agatha was locking the front door behind the two of them. Rio was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, and Agatha had put on real clothes without an elasticated waistband. She wasn’t pregnant enough to only wear stretchy pants <em> yet</em>, she reminded herself, although the temptation had been there. </p><p>As they stepped into the hallway, a burst of regret threatened to send her running back inside. There was still time to hold her ground, to back away from the unsettling kindness Rio was hell-bent on showing her. She could feign nausea or exhaustion. That would be believable coming from a grumpy pregnant lady.</p><p>But something about the way Rio just waited beside her, calm and casual, made her hesitate. <em> Fine</em>, Agatha told herself. <em> Just a couple of hours, and she’d be off her case </em>. </p><p>She looked at Rio expectantly as they made it onto the street, slipping her own sunglasses over her eyes. “So?”</p><p>“So, bookstore.”</p><p>Agatha puffed out her cheeks in a defeated sigh. It was Rio’s world, and somehow, she’d found herself living smack-bang in the middle of it. </p><p align="center">——— </p><p>Their walk to the subway station had been quiet, but less tense than Agatha had expected, offset by the sun beating down on their faces and the soft clink of Rio’s keys dangling from a carabiner on her shorts. </p><p>Once they’d gotten onto the packed train, full of kids on their way to soccer practice and couples canoodling over coffee, Rio had woven through the crowds to find Agatha a seat. </p><p>She had complained, predictably—she was barely pregnant, and certainly not an invalid. But Rio had insisted, so she sat.</p><p>After that, they’d fallen into mindless conversation, Agatha watching Rio hang off the metal subway pole like an overgrown child, and she’d felt herself loosening up more as they passed each station.</p><p>It was easier now that she wasn’t actively trying to fight it, and while the voice in her head wanted to pick at what that meant, she let herself press pause on the interrogation. The whole point of this outing was to be present, to forget for a little while. </p><p>So, she grounded herself in the moment, listening to Rio talk while the world went by around them.</p><p>When the train came to a groaning halt, Rio navigated their way out of the subway and through the streets of Prospect Heights, using her phone to guide her. Now, they were face-to-face with what used to be one of Agatha’s most frequented haunts: Hart’s Books. </p><p>She stared up at the emerald green facade and striped awnings, trying to remember the last time she’d visited. Everything looked the same—the peeling gold lettering on the windows, the stacks of books facing out towards the world. Even when everything around her was in flux, at least one thing was constant, and the thought comforted her. </p><p>After a few minutes, Rio turned to her and raised an eyebrow. “We gonna go in, or do we have to be like… invited? Wait, is this a vampire thing?”</p><p>It catapulted Agatha right back into the present. “Oh my god,” she chuckled under her breath. “You’re so stupid.”</p><p>“Mmm?” Rio replied, the corner of her mouth twitching up as she pretended not to hear her. </p><p>“Yes, we can go in,” Agatha said, louder this time.</p><p>As they crossed over the threshold into the store, the comforting scent of old pages and vanilla candles swirled around them. Rio quickly disappeared into the shelves while Agatha lingered near the doorway.</p><p>“Agatha!” the older woman behind the till greeted her kindly, face lighting up with a warm, wide smile. She looked the same as she always had, her cardigan buttoned and hair neatly blow-dried.</p><p>“Hi, Mrs Hart,” Agatha said. She couldn’t have stopped her smile if she’d wanted to—she’d been visiting this bookstore for over a decade, and Sharon had become a fixture in her life, whether Agatha was promoting her own new release or just topping up her to-be-read pile.</p><p>“It’s Mrs Davis, dear, remember—Hart’s is just the name of the bookstore.” Agatha just hummed in agreement, knowing it would go in one ear and out the other. She’d never been able to get that one right.</p><p>“How are you, Agatha? It’s been so long since I’ve seen you,” Sharon tottered out from behind the counter so they were face-to-face.</p><p>“I’m good, Mrs—” <em> Oh god, she’d forgotten again. </em> “Sharon.” </p><p>“That handsome fellow of yours propose to you yet?” Sharon asked, resting a hand on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>The laugh bubbled up before she could stop it—sharp, cynical, and entirely inappropriate. She pressed a hand to her mouth, trying to cover it with a cough. </p><p><em> No</em>, she thought, <em> he dumped me when he found out I was pregnant</em>. A month or two ago it would’ve been too raw to talk about, but at this point, with everything else going on, it all just felt absurd.</p><p>Sharon had always asked after Ralph ever since she’d met him, which had only been the once—an impromptu visit on their way back from one of his work functions in Manhattan. From then, she’d been more focused on the idea of Agatha and Ralph getting married than either of them ever were. In hindsight, Agatha supposed, that was a sign of their inevitable demise.</p><p>She mulled over how to answer the question gently, before realising she could actually say what she was thinking. Sure, it might provoke a mild heart attack, but maybe it’d feel good to say it out loud.</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied matter-of-factly. “He dumped me when he found out I was pregnant.” </p><p>Shock rippled across Sharon’s features, her face turning bright red as she fumbled her words. “I’m— oh, golly, I mean— Agatha…”</p><p>“It’s okay, Sharon,” Agatha gave her hand a quick pat. “I’m doing fine,” she said.</p><p>Sharon pursed her lips thoughtfully, like she was making up her mind about something. “Well, who needs him anyway,” she finally said, with an indignant shake of her head. “A baby, though! Now that’s exciting.”</p><p>“Yes, it is,” Agatha smiled.<em> Fuck—now that was a real, genuine smile</em>, she thought. <em> Those were few and far between. Maybe she was making some progress, after all</em>. </p><p>Before Sharon could launch into the hundreds of questions Agatha was sure she had about the baby, Rio emerged from behind one of the tall wooden shelves, a stack of paperbacks in her arms. “Agatha, I’m gonna need you to help me pick…” </p><p>“Hello!” Sharon looked at Rio curiously. “And who might you be?”</p><p>Rio shot Agatha an amused look at the old-timey turn of phrase.</p><p>“Sharon, this is Rio, my roommate,” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Sharon,” Rio shuffled the books in her arms and extended a hand for her to shake. Sharon took it, a vaguely charmed expression on her face. If she didn’t know any better, Agatha would’ve sworn there was a hint of a blush creeping onto her cheeks.</p><p>“And you too, Rio. Agatha here was just telling me about the baby,” she said, making no show of hiding her joy. “It’s wonderful news, isn’t it?” </p><p>“Very,” Rio said solemnly. “Did she tell you about her dramatic pregnancy symptoms?” </p><p>Sharon whipped around to face Agatha, a hand pressed to her heart. </p><p>“Oh, it’s nothing,” Agatha brushed off. “I’ve just had some morning sickness.”</p><p>“Have you been helping her?” Sharon looked back at Rio, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“I’ve been trying, Sharon,” Rio raised her palms upwards in a <em> what can you do</em>-style question. “But she’s stubborn.”</p><p>Now it was Agatha’s turn to glare at Rio.</p><p>Rio winked back at her, quick and sly. Her stomach did that <em> thing </em> again, the one she struggled to name—flipped, twisted, tensed, whatever you wanted to call it. She stiffened for a second before relaxing back into the conversation, hoping no one had noticed.</p><p>“You have to let her help you, Agatha,” Sharon scolded, swatting at her arm playfully with all the strength of a mosquito.</p><p>“I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself, Mrs Hart.” </p><p>“Mrs <em> Davis</em>, honey,” Sharon corrected her again, a little less patiently this time. “And I know you are,” she continued. “But you’re going to need all the help you can get when this baby comes. They’re not easy, those little humans.”</p><p>Rio nudged Agatha, arms still laden with books. “That’s what I’ve been telling her.”</p><p>Feeling the weight of two sets of eyes scrutinising her, Agatha changed the topic, reaching for the books Rio was holding. </p><p>“Good,” she appraised, handing one of the books back to Rio. “Awful—not worth your time,” she continued, shucking that one onto the counter. “Worth a read, <em> yes</em>, and,” she brandished the final book in Rio’s stack, “we have this one at home.” </p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said, fixing her with a dazzling smile as she collected the discarded books and wandered back over to the shelves to put them away. Once she was out of earshot, Sharon leaned in—far too close for Agatha’s liking, but she’d let it slide. </p><p>“She seems just lovely,” Sharon whispered conspiratorially.</p><p>“Yeah, she’s great,” Agatha agreed. It was an automatic response—a natural reaction to the compliment—but she meant it. Rio <em> was </em>great, and she couldn’t pretend she wasn’t. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>Rio ambled back around the corner then, clutching the books Agatha had approved and what looked like a few new additions. A flash of colour caught her eye, but she didn’t probe or ask what else Rio had picked up as she laid them on the counter and reached for her wallet. </p><p>While Sharon busied herself ringing Rio up, Agatha took her own opportunity to walk through the shelves of the bookstore, inhaling the scent of fresh paperbacks, trailing her fingers along their spines. </p><p>There was something magical about a new book—a story yet to be discovered, waiting to be devoured—that sent a jolt of excitement through her. Instead of opening up her Goodreads profile to find something she’d been meaning to read, Agatha decided to let fate have her way. She picked up the first cover that stood out to her without a second thought.</p><p>When she made it back to the counter, Rio and Sharon were chatting idly about something she couldn’t discern, Rio’s laughter bouncing off the walls of the small store.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Rio turned to ask, noticing Agatha had returned.</p><p>“Yep,” she replied, handing the book to Sharon. “Just gonna grab this one first.”</p><p>Sharon waved off the wad of cash Agatha was holding and put the book in a brown paper bag. “Consider it a gift,” she smiled at her, “for my favourite long-lost customer.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together in a silent <em> thank you</em>. Taking a freebie from an independent bookstore felt like an affront to everything she stood for, but something in Sharon’s expression told her she knew Agatha needed the kindness today.</p><p>“Can I expect you in for a signing anytime soon?” the bookstore owner asked, watching on as they gathered up their purchases and went to leave.</p><p>“Well, my next one probably won’t come out until after the kid does,” Agatha joked. Her productivity came in fits and starts these days, only settling when she was trying to distract herself. But, her deadlines still loomed, and at this rate, publication would coincide with the other important milestone in her life. “But then, of course.”</p><p>“Perfect, I’ll be looking forward to it. Goodbye, Agatha,” Sharon waved. “Bye-bye, Rio. I hope I’ll be seeing you both again soon.”</p><p>They waved back in her direction as they stepped out onto the street, midday sun hitting them in full force. Agatha tipped her sunglasses back onto her face, and Rio fished her baseball cap out of the worn green tote bag that now held her generous haul.</p><p>“Bagels?” Rio turned to Agatha questioningly.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and nodded, letting the sun warm her face. “Need caffeine.” They stepped off the curb together, Rio leading the way to the spot she’d saved in her Maps. </p><p>Behind the heavy glass door of the bookstore, Sharon went back to rearranging the shelves, chuckling quietly as she went. “Roommates,” she mused. “I guess that’s what the kids are calling it these days.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>A short walk later, they arrived at another pillar from Agatha’s old life—the one where she wasn’t bed-bound and questioning her every move. Her favourite bagel shop. </p><p>The smell of fresh bread and coffee overwhelmed her when she pushed through the front door, bell chiming as Rio followed. She walked over to her usual table on auto-pilot, grabbing two menus from the counter as she passed. She handed Rio one when they sat down, watching as her tongue poked out of the corner of her mouth, deciding what to order.</p><p>Before long, their food and coffee had arrived, and Agatha was humming gratefully into her cappuccino while Rio eyed her from over the top of an iced oat milk latte.</p><p>“Are we friends?” Rio asked out of the blue.</p><p>Agatha frowned, hand stilling around the warmth of her coffee cup. “You’re my roommate, Rio. Don’t forget what I said to you when you moved in.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio nodded slowly in acknowledgement. “But this,” she gestured at the table between them, laden with food and coffee, “this says ‘friends’ to me.”</p><p>“Fine. We’re… friendly, then,” Agatha said, the distinction clear. “That enough for you?” </p><p>Rio was shifting in her seat a little, hand drumming a staccato rhythm on the table. <em> Was she nervous? </em>Agatha wondered, confused.</p><p>“Honestly?” Rio asked. Agatha nodded, signalling for Rio to go on. “I mean, not really. I’d like to be your friend, you know.”</p><p>The urge to be honest rose in her throat before she could swallow it down. “I guess I… don’t really know what to do with friends,” Agatha admitted. </p><p>Rio gave a small shrug. “Today was a pretty good start, I think.”</p><p>Agatha paused and let Rio’s words settle between them. She was right—this was what friends did. Shared meals, talked about themselves, supported one another through hard shit. Rio had done all of those things, for and with her, without wavering once. And it was… nice.</p><p>She couldn’t deny it any longer—there were no barriers to being friends with Rio other than her own stubbornness. She’d grasped at every reason to keep her at arm’s length, but none of them had stuck long enough to count.</p><p>Except she couldn’t in good conscience say <em> yes, I’ll be your friend</em>, without clearing the air first. And while that morning she’d been the furthest thing from ready, after their day together, she felt strangely at ease.</p><p>“Why aren’t you mad at me?” Agatha questioned, blue eyes narrowing as she searched Rio’s brown ones. She was looking for a hint of resentment; a suggestion Rio might be harboring some negativity after she’d stormed out the other night.</p><p>The corner of Rio’s mouth turned up curiously. “Do I have a reason to be mad at you?”</p><p>“Well, I haven’t exactly been nice to you the last week. You know, after the dinner. After…” she trailed off, not wanting to rehash it.</p><p>“You needed space, I get that,” Rio said plainly. “It wasn’t exactly a fun conversation. For <em> anyone</em>,” her tongue wandered to the side of her cheek. “But I’m guessing particularly not for you.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied quietly, staring at the half of her bagel she’d yet to finish.</p><p>Rio glanced down at the table like she was contemplating something, fingers trailing over the condensation from her iced coffee. When she looked back up, her eyes were fiery, darker than Agatha had ever seen them.</p><p>“Agatha, Jen was so fucking out of line. I don’t—,” she exhaled sharply. “I don’t know what possessed her to do that. To think she had the <em> right </em> to do that.”</p><p>“Rio—” Agatha ran a hand through her hair, working anxiously at a knot towards the bottom.</p><p>“No,” Rio cut her off firmly. “I talked to Alice about it. I told her Jen needs to apologise to you. The fact that it’s been over a week and she isn’t banging on our front door begging for your forgiveness—”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha cast her eyes downward again, sighing. “Water under the bridge,” she deflected.</p><p>“She tried to out you in front of us, Agatha,” Rio pressed. “I think it’s great that Jen’s so comfortable with her own sexuality, I really do. But she doesn’t get to comment on someone else’s.” As she said that, her tone softened, like she was doing everything she could to get through to her. “I should’ve called her out on the spot.”</p><p>Rio was right—Agatha knew she was. She’d known it since the second Jen had leaned in rather than backing off. And she had to admit it was validating, knowing Rio was on her side. </p><p>But there was more to it than that. There was something gut-wrenchingly honest in the way Rio jumped to protect her, even though it had taken her a beat to get there.</p><p>Because previously, Rio had been nothing but nice. This was a different side of her—one that hinted that her niceness was less about who she was, and more about <em> Agatha</em>.</p><p>It made her feel safe, she realised. And friends did that too, right? Protected each other so fiercely it felt like safety?</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha finally said, her words small but sincere. “I mean that.” She exhaled a breath she hadn’t realised she was holding. “But, can we change the subject? Please?”</p><p>Rio took her in for a moment longer, before leaning back in the booth, resting her tattooed arm behind her head. “Sure,” she nodded. “Ball’s in your court, though, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha racked her brain for something that would give her a little relief. She settled on asking about Rio’s many, many activities. “Okay, so I got the whole massage backstory at dinner. And I know about the nursery,” she pondered. “But what about school?”</p><p>“What about it?” </p><p>“I don’t know… what are you studying?” Agatha already knew the answer—the textbooks that had taken up residence in her apartment had told her. But she wanted to hear it in Rio’s words. </p><p>“Education. Biology and physics, specifically,” Rio replied.</p><p>“So, high school then?”</p><p>“Mm-hmm. I love little kids, don’t get me wrong, but I think I’d struggle to discipline them.” </p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Did you grow up around other kids?”</p><p>“Yeah, kind of,” Rio nodded. “In some of my foster homes, before I ended up at Lilia’s.” Her voice was still airy, unaffected, probably for Agatha’s sake—but she knew she was steering them into serious territory.</p><p>Agatha toyed with the edge of her napkin, wondering if she should pull back. What had started as an innocuous question was already hinting at something heavy again, and she didn’t want to make Rio uncomfortable after all the good will she’d shown her. And selfishly, she wanted to keep things light before she inevitably retreated back into her own head later—so sue her.</p><p>“So, what’s the end game, then? With college?”</p><p>“Well, I’m taking summer classes right now, and then I have one more semester before I’m done,” Rio leaned forward, her chin in her hands. “If I don’t fail anything, I’ll graduate in December. Probably teach supply until the new school year starts.” </p><p>“December will be here soon enough,” Agatha remarked. “It’s going to be a busy end of the year for both of us.”</p><p>“Is that when you’re due?” Rio took a bite of her bagel, scattering poppyseeds across her plate.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Christmas baby,” she said softly. When she’d seen the doctor for her first ultrasound, they’d given her a rough due date of December 21st, a short six months from now. Not exactly Christmas, but close enough.</p><p>She tried to picture what her life would look like by then—but the future was hazy, her magic 8-ball broken. <em> Ask again later</em>. <em> Cannot predict now</em>.</p><p>“Ooft, that’d be a rough birthday,” Rio joked. “Might wanna think about popping it out early.” </p><p>“Oh, sure,” she rolled her eyes, looking down at her stomach. “You hear that? Rio wants you to evacuate the premises early.” Her gaze flicked back up to Rio. “They say they’ll think about it.” </p><p>“Christmas and Halloween. Got all the holidays covered in the Harkness household,” Rio hummed thoughtfully, top lip twitching with a hint of mirth.</p><p><em> That’s right</em>, Agatha remembered. Rio had asked about her birthday the first day they’d met.</p><p>“When’s your birthday?” she asked.</p><p>“Oh, you’re gonna love this,” Rio drummed her hands against the table ceremoniously. “It’s the Fourth of July.”</p><p>Agatha almost spat out her coffee. “Oh my god, you’re kidding,” she cackled, her laughter echoing throughout the restaurant. “You’re right, that’s <em> insane</em>.” She paused. “Hang on—that’s like two weeks from now.”</p><p>“Look at you, doing math and shit.”</p><p>“Have you got any plans?”</p><p>“Not really,” Rio shrugged. “I’ll probably have dinner at Lilia’s, maybe see Alice over the weekend. But 32 isn’t exactly a big deal,” she finished.</p><p>Agatha, in a rare reversal of roles, actually <em> did </em>have plans for the Fourth. </p><p>“Well, if you don’t mind spending the day with people you don’t know, I usually go to Wanda’s place in Jersey for a barbecue. You could invite Alice… and Jen, I guess.” </p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted how casual the offer sounded. Like it was no big deal—like inviting Rio, and worse, <em> Jen</em>, into the same orbit as the Maximoffs didn’t mean blurring the lines of their oddly intersecting worlds even more. </p><p>But she didn’t backpedal. They were friends now, according to Rio, and friends celebrated each other’s birthdays.</p><p>She swallowed the lump that had risen in her throat and waited for an answer.</p><p>“That sounds like fun,” Rio’s mouth turned up in a smile, setting Agatha at ease. “I love a cookout. Beer, sunshine, someone’s dad saying something inappropriate.” </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Well, there’ll be two teenage boys in attendance, so I can’t promise you won’t endure your fair share of dumb remarks. Especially if you insist on bringing those gross veggie sausages,” she warned. She couldn’t wait to hear what juvenile jokes Tommy would make about that.</p><p>“Girl’s gotta eat,” Rio gestured to the crumbs of her bagel, eyeing Agatha’s clean plate and empty coffee cup. “You all done?” </p><p><em> No. </em> Agatha thought. <em> Yes</em>. <em> I don’t know.</em> She didn’t know how to verbalise it—the feeling of wanting to sit in a moment of lightness a little longer, of dreading what could creep back in once she left it. </p><p>But she’d probably already overstayed her welcome.</p><p>“Yeah,” she grabbed her bag from next to her on the booth, her new book weighing heavy at the bottom. “Let’s go home.” She slung enough money on the table to cover both of their meals and stood to leave.</p><p>Rio looked at her thoughtfully as she held the door to the bagel place open. “Wanna walk home?” she asked, voice flecked with what sounded a little like hope.</p><p>“It’s like an hour to walk,” Agatha frowned, nearly tripping over a step. She tried to steady herself on the railing, but Rio’s arm shot out and grabbed her elbow before she could. </p><p>Her hand stayed there, resting against her skin. Agatha looked at her, then up at the sky. Maybe they had time, after all.</p><p>“Okay,” she found herself agreeing. “It’s a beautiful day.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Agatha entered the cafe, she spotted Jen already sitting at one of the tables, waiting. She was predictably dressed in pink, a skirt suit situation that made her look like Barbie’s book agent, not Agatha’s.</p><p>There was a cup of something hot in front of her, steam rising visibly in the air-conditioned cafe. Her eyes were cast downward in thought, picking at a fingernail absentmindedly, and it made her look… smaller, somehow.</p><p>It was a far cry from the Jen she knew, the one who was loud and brash and larger than life. It prickled at Agatha uncomfortably, the realisation that <em> she’d </em> caused this—that she was the reason that Jen was sitting here looking like someone had just kicked her dog or thrown her best heels out the window.</p><p>But Rio’s words echoed in her mind, on replay the way they had been since Sunday.</p><p><em> Jen was so fucking out of line</em>. </p><p><em> She doesn’t get to comment on someone else’s sexuality</em>. </p><p><em> I should’ve called her out on the spot</em>.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she wanted forgiveness or a fight. But she knew she had to brave it one way or the other—to let Jen say her piece, nip it in the bud, and then hopefully, move the fuck on with her life. So she rolled her shoulders back, plastered on her stoniest expression, and strode over to where Jen was sitting. </p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said tightly, throwing her bag onto the table before dropping into the seat across from Jen. It weighed a ton, probably because she had at least one book in there, and the <em> thud </em>it elicited, paired with Jen’s startled expression, satisfied the shit out of her.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen replied, once she’d collected herself. “Thanks for meeting me.”</p><p>Agatha just grunted and flagged down a waiter, barking her coffee order at him. Jen went to open her mouth again, but she held up a finger in her direction to silence her. Nothing productive would come out of her mouth before she’d had caffeine, and she needed a moment to steel herself.</p><p>Even though she’d been bracing herself for an awkward apology since Jen texted on Monday morning, seeing her look genuinely remorseful was new. She’d half-expected her to come in full of false bravado, hand her a one-worded <em> sorry</em>, and be done with it.</p><p>It was only when the heat of the mug was scalding Agatha’s hands that she dignified Jen with a response—and even then, it was monosyllabic.</p><p>“Talk.”</p><p>Jen ran a hand over her head. “I fucked up,” she said, although Agatha could see that it pained her to admit it. She sighed, audible and shaky. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, taking a long, slow sip of her coffee. It was a start—she hadn’t expected the ‘s’ word to come out of Jen’s mouth so quickly—but it didn’t even begin to cover the breadth of emotional turmoil she’d caused.</p><p>She cleared her throat, eyes locked on Jen’s, and waited for her to continue.</p><p>“I’m sorry for putting words in your mouth,” Jen said. “And for not backing down. I should’ve left it when you said you weren’t queer, and I sure as hell shouldn’t have done it in front of everyone.” She looked down again, as if she might find the right words to say written in the foam of her coffee. “I don’t know what I was fucking thinking,” she murmured.</p><p><em> Better</em>, Agatha thought. If she herself was allergic to apologies, Jen was intolerant at the very least—so she knew it meant something. There was just one more loose end Agatha wanted to tie up.</p><p>The caffeine had made its way into her system enough that this time, she could manage a full sentence. “So why did it take Rio talking to Alice to trigger this little admission?”</p><p>“It shouldn’t have. I just…” Jen exhaled, two fingers kneading at the bridge of her nose. “I thought I knew something about you that I clearly didn’t, and—ugh,” she huffed. “I sound like a fucking after-school special.” </p><p>“You sound like someone who crossed a line,” Agatha replied coolly.</p><p>Jen pursed her lips. “You’re right, I crossed a line,” she finally acknowledged. “I’m sorry for thinking I knew you better than you know yourself.” </p><p>Now <em> that </em>was the kicker. It was the one remnant of the other night that had been circling her like a shark—that is, whenever she wasn’t trying to push the whole thing out of her head or rationalise it away.</p><p>The idea that someone had seen something she hadn’t and latched onto it so firmly was terrifying. And the idea of them admitting they were wrong freed up space in Agatha’s chest so she could finally breathe.</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her drink, mulling over what to say next. “Apology accepted,” she finally exhaled, before raising an eyebrow at Jen. “Begrudgingly. Watch your back, Kale.”</p><p>“Oh, trust me, I’ve learned my lesson,” Jen scoffed. But, there was a smile playing on her lips. She leaned back in her chair, posture relaxing, and drained the last of her latte.</p><p>“So, did being such a heartless bitch to me fuck anything up with Alice?”</p><p>“Mmm,” Jen replied, biting her lip. “We’ve talked about it. I think she was too confused by our whole thing to really dig into me, but I’ve done my share of grovelling,” she said wryly. “We’re okay.”</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” Agatha said. She still felt tightly wound, but she really <em> was </em>happy that her conflict with Jen hadn’t gotten in between her and Alice. By all accounts, they were a well-matched couple—Jen’s assertiveness, Alice’s chill.</p><p>“I thought you’d be gunning for a premature breakup,” Jen joked.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Thought about it. Daydreamed about it, actually,” she mused. And yeah—she <em> had</em>. But she’d come to the conclusion that damning Alice and Jen’s relationship to hell wasn’t going to get her, or anyone, anywhere. <em> And that</em>, she thought, <em> was on growth. </em> </p><p>“Alice seems like she really likes you. Not sure <em> why</em>,” Agatha smirked, lifting an eyebrow in Jen’s direction. She made a disgruntled sound, but let Agatha keep going. “But who am I to fuck with that? Even if you did try to get me to join your coven of lesbians,” she joked, an ant-sized peace offering.</p><p>Jen laughed at that, the tension between them dissipating. </p><p>And that was just who they were, Agatha and Jen. They’d bicker, and poke at each other, and now, it seemed, rip each other a new one in front of their friends—but the bite marks faded eventually. </p><p>This one easily could’ve turned into something bigger, something rotten, considering how deep Jen had sunk her teeth into her. But she had thick skin. Jen had done the right thing—and Agatha had actually let her, instead of just burying it under the rug. Was this what progress felt like?</p><p>She glanced down at her half-empty coffee cup. It had gone lukewarm, but she kept her hands wrapped around it anyway, steadying herself. She looked back up at Jen again, ready to make another joke at her expense and break through the quiet—but Jen’s expression had turned curious. And Jen’s curiosity, as recent events had proven, was never good.</p><p>“Now that it’s just you and me,” Jen tilted her head, leaning her elbows against the wooden table. “Are you and…” She stopped, like she was choosing her words carefully. “Is there something between you and Rio?”</p><p>That same flash of defensiveness rose again. Scratch everything she’d said about progress—Jen was clearly batshit crazy. <em> Have you learned nothing? </em> Agatha thought. Here they were, supposedly clearing the air, and Jen was choosing now of all moments to backtrack. To imply something that frankly, she knew nothing about. </p><p>She fought the urge to hit back at her. The cafe was quiet, and although she’d made her fair share of public scenes in her life, now probably wasn’t the time to scare every barista in a five-mile radius. She settled on shutting whatever the fuck this was down quickly and quietly. </p><p>“We’re friends, Jen,” Agatha said flatly. “That’s all it is.” </p><p>Jen opened her mouth, then closed it, pressing her lips together in thought. Eventually she nodded, considering Agatha’s point.</p><p>“I know that’s how <em> you </em> feel, and I’m not going there again,” Jen said, although Agatha could see it was costing her a great deal of restraint. She hesitated, tapping a manicured nail against her coffee cup. “I just get the feeling that Rio likes you,” she said. “As more than friends, maybe.”</p><p>The admission swirled around in Agatha’s mind. It didn’t hit her like a slap, or threaten to upend the contents of her stomach right there on the table. It just lifted the corner of something that had previously been glued down, like a sticker she’d been picking at that was now coming free.</p><p>She tracked back over Rio’s behaviour, the way she acted around her. Sure, she was attentive, and kind, and for some inexplicable reason, rolled with all of Agatha’s many moods.</p><p>But that was just who Rio was. Who she’d shown herself to be, time and time again. Rio hadn’t done or said anything to make Agatha think otherwise.</p><p>She pressed the corner of the sticker back down.</p><p>“Well, she doesn’t,” Agatha replied firmly. “Rio’s just an exceedingly nice person,” she added. <em> And charming, and good, and funny, and—not relevant</em>. “Stop trying to make it into something that it isn’t,” she warned.</p><p>The memory of how she felt at dinner—the heat crawling in her chest, her heart spitting out a million beats a minute—was still raw. Revisiting it wouldn’t do any good.</p><p>Jen held her hands up in surrender. “Okay,” she exhaled. “I’m sorry. Officially backing off now.” </p><p>“Thank god for that,” Agatha muttered. Avoiding Jen’s tight-lipped, apologetic smile, she reached over and rummaged through her bag, producing a journal filled with her latest book notes. She needed to focus on something, <em> anything </em>else—something that would let her put a pin in the long, slow, painful unravelling of the last few weeks.</p><p>“Now, can we talk about work?”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>With the Jen thing neatly squared away, Agatha supposed she had no choice now but to do as she’d promised—to invite her, Alice, and Rio to the Maximoffs’ Fourth of July celebrations. Which was how she’d found herself propped up against the pillows in bed the next morning, drafting a text to Wanda.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> So I have a question slash favour to ask you…  </em></p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> Hi, Agatha. I’m good, thanks for asking. How are you?  </em></p><p>Agatha groaned, blowing a strand of hair out of her eyes.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Oh, come off it.  </em></p><p>The three dots that indicated Wanda was typing appeared, then disappeared again. <em> Stubborn witch </em>. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Fine, how are you? </em></p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> Overworked, sleep deprived, and living in a house with three boys who don’t understand that their smelly gym socks aren’t living room decor. You be the judge.  </em></p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Eww. Okay, onto my question. </em></p><p>Agatha started typing out the next message: <em> Can I invite Rio and co to the Fourth? It’s her birthday and I thought it would be nice for her to celebrate with us.  </em></p><p>She stared at the screen, then backspaced furiously to delete it. Too personal. It couldn’t sound like a big deal—because it wasn’t. She’d just opened her mouth without thinking, a habit she <em> really </em> needed to work on, and now she had to live with the repercussions.</p><p>She called on every shred of nonchalance she had and channelled it into a revision.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Can I invite a few people to your Fourth barbecue? </em></p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> Sure, the more the merrier!  </em></p><p><em> Phew </em> , Agatha thought. <em> That was easy. </em></p><p>Another text pinged a few seconds later.</p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> But you have to tell me who. </em></p><p>She buried her face in the pillow and let out a groan. Always with the probing questions. Still, Agatha supposed there wasn’t a world in which she’d get off that easy—and it didn’t have to be some big reveal. It was perfectly normal to invite her roommate and her friends to a social gathering. Even if one of those friends was her formerly estranged literary agent. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> Rio and Alice. And Jen. </em></p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> What!? I have so many questions and five minutes to get ready for work. I’m calling you right now!! </em></p><p>“I’m just getting in the car,” Wanda warned her as she picked up the phone. Agatha looked down at her legs, tucked up under the covers of the bed. Maybe it was time to start waking up earlier. Then again, she had less than six months of sleep as she knew it left—and Agatha Harkness <em> loved </em> sleep.</p><p>“Now, what’s this about Rio and <em> Jen </em> coming to my family-friendly barbecue? I’m all for building bridges, but do you really think that’s a good idea?” Wanda continued.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Jen and I already made up,” she said. Wanda made a surprised sound, muffled by the receiver, but still unmistakably there.</p><p>“Really?” she intoned slowly, stretching out each syllable.</p><p>“Yes, really,” Agatha confirmed. “She apologised.”</p><p>“Phew,” Wanda replied, exhaling a long, audible stream of breath. “Vision and I were taking bets on how long you guys would ice each other out.”</p><p>Of course Wanda had told Vision. God forbid she keep her mouth shut for a second—although Agatha supposed she should’ve suspected as much, considering how she handed confidential patient stories around like they were after-dinner mints.</p><p>“And?” Agatha enquired dryly.</p><p>“Oh, neither of us were even in the vicinity of a week. I thought it’d be like… months.” She paused. “I’m glad you’re friends again.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far, Wanda.”</p><p>“Tomato, tomahto,” she brushed her off airily. “And Rio?” </p><p>“Why is it always <em> and Rio</em>?” Agatha snapped. “Can’t I just do something nice for someone without it being a whole thing?”</p><p>“No,” Wanda shot back, reflexes trained from years of friendship. “That’s extremely out-of-character behaviour for you.” </p><p>“Rio and I are friends,” Agatha said, trying to sound casual about it. “We went to Hart’s Books on Sunday, had some bagels. I’m taking <em> your </em> advice,” she added reproachfully.</p><p>“And this would be…” Wanda paused for effect. “The first time you’ve ever done that. So colour me surprised.”</p><p>“I found out during our little outing that Rio’s birthday is the Fourth of July,” Agatha ignored her, continuing without missing a beat. “She said she didn’t have any plans and it felt weird not to invite her.”</p><p>“Well, that was sweet of you,” Wanda remarked. </p><p><em> Sweet? </em> No. Harknesses didn’t do <em> sweet</em>. It was a functional choice at best—a way to kill two birds with one stone. To save Rio from spending her birthday alone, and to create some kind of buffer around the baby questions, and the Ralph questions, the book questions. People had too many questions.</p><p>With Rio there—and Jen and Alice—maybe she’d be able to avoid talking too much about herself and shift the spotlight onto other people. <em> And wouldn’t that be a fucking relief</em>, she thought distantly. </p><p>It had absolutely nothing to do with the time they’d spent together the other day; the way that relaxing around Rio felt like cracking a door of a pitch-black room and letting a sliver of sunlight in. Nothing at all.</p><p>“Anyway,” Wanda continued, “totally fine to invite them. It might be nice to have some new faces around, other people for the boys to annoy.”</p><p>“She’s been forewarned,” Agatha chuckled. “Billy’s going to be all over her like a rash.”</p><p>Wanda laughed in agreement. “I’m excited to meet her,” she said. “And Jen and Alice,” she added, although Agatha could sense it was an afterthought.</p><p>“Okay, keep it in your pants, Red.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After a long day of redrafting a singular, maddening chapter of her book, Agatha walked into the living room in search of something—or rather, someone—to distract her. She’d expected Rio to be stretched out on the couch watching a nature documentary, or in the kitchen making something that smelled good and tasted better. But, she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Looking around, Agatha zeroed in on one of the armchairs, where Rio’s stuff was haphazardly resting, wallet falling out of her messenger bag, crumpled papers sitting on top. She resisted the urge to straighten things up—<em> not just your house</em>, she reminded herself—and instead, pushed open the sliding glass doors to the only other place Rio could be. The balcony.</p><p>She was slumped in one of the wicker chairs, Doc-clad feet up on the railing, looking off into the distance at the New York skyline as the sun began to set. Agatha’s eyes went straight to the faint orange glow coming from between her index and middle fingers.</p><p>“Shit. Oh my go—” Rio stammered, noticing Agatha. The lit end of her cigarette brushed against her hand, and she winced.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” she breathed, once she’d regained her composure. “I don’t ever do this in the apartment, I swear. I usually go outside, but I… I really needed one tonight.”</p><p>Agatha had to stifle a laugh at Rio’s stumble. It was kinda cute, how nervous she looked. Like Agatha’s opinion meant something.</p><p>If only Rio knew what she wouldn’t give for the delicious bitterness of a cigarette right now, especially after hours of staring at her laptop screen. She’d pretended to quit over a decade ago at her mother’s behest, but she’d run back to the vice many a time since then, when she was stressed or strung out and didn’t feel like rolling a joint.</p><p>Getting pregnant had, understandably, made her kick the habit for good—or at least, for nine months. Still, she thought about it more than ever, now that she had nothing to take the edge off.</p><p>She placed a hand on the back of the other chair and gestured towards Rio. “Can I sit with you?”</p><p>Rio frowned, opened her mouth, then shut it again, nodding. She flicked some ash into the ceramic tray on the outdoor table, an addition Agatha hadn’t noticed before. It was shaped like a crab, bright red and garish, its pincers held up in the air.</p><p>It was dumb, and it was so <em> goddamn Rio </em> she couldn’t help but chuckle at it.</p><p>Agatha plonked herself down in the cushy chair, still eyeing the ashtray. She placed one hand on her belly—a little softer and rounder than it had been a few weeks ago—and the other under her chin, looking at Rio curiously. She seemed tired, less bright than usual; hair hastily scraped off her face in a ponytail.</p><p>“What makes you think I’d care if you smoked on the balcony?”</p><p>Rio looked at her dumbly, as if afraid to say a word. </p><p>“Was it my aggressive cohabitation rules that scared you off?” </p><p>She watched as the cogs turned in Rio’s head and, clearly amused by Agatha’s sudden self-awareness, she eventually sputtered a laugh. “Yeah, I think that had something to do with it.” </p><p>Rio was laughing harder now, tears of mirth welling up in her eyes. As if freed by the silliness of it all, Agatha let herself laugh, too.</p><p>It felt good. Healing, somehow. To laugh at the ridiculous front she’d put up when Rio moved in, how much of a hardass she was sometimes—fuck, it got so exhausting.</p><p>It had been so long since she’d laughed the way she seemed to around Rio. Real, unguarded. Light. Since finding out she was pregnant, her whole body had felt clenched—like she was bracing for impact, waiting for yet another shoe to drop and hit her on the fucking head.</p><p>And maybe it was the nature of living with another person, of seeing each other in every state of existence, but being messy around Rio didn’t really feel that scary anymore. Especially now that they were friends.</p><p>“Well, I hereby grant you permission to smoke, as long as it’s not inside the house. Balcony only,” Agatha said, still chuckling.</p><p>“Got it, boss.”</p><p>Rio lit another cigarette, the first one long burnt to ash thanks to their spontaneous interlude, and took a drag. When she exhaled, it was almost as if Agatha could feel the smoke burning her lungs. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she sighed contentedly.</p><p>When she opened them again, Rio was looking at her with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>“What?” Agatha felt the smile twitching at the corner of her mouth. “Can’t a pregnant woman enjoy a little secondhand smoke every now and then?” </p><p>“No, Agatha,” Rio’s shoulders were already shaking with laughter again. “She can’t—or at least, shouldn’t, I think.” She smiled, shaking her head. “When’s the last time you had one?”</p><p><em> Oh god, </em>Agatha thought. It was an innocent question, but Agatha’s answer was loaded. She sucked her top lip into her mouth, teeth worrying the soft flesh there. “You’re gonna judge me,” she shook her head.</p><p>“Not really my style.” Rio had stopped laughing and was resting her own head on one hand now, mirroring Agatha’s posture.</p><p>“I had one when I found out I was pregnant,” Agatha said softly. “I know, I know—extremely bad for the baby. I spiralled over it for weeks, don’t you worry.” She lifted a hand and ran it through her hair. “Just needed something to take the edge off the whole impending motherhood shebang, you know?”</p><p>“I can imagine it wouldn’t have been an easy thing to face.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment. “It wasn’t. I—” She paused. “Thank you. I don’t think I’ve really let myself acknowledge yet that I’m doing a hard thing. Having this kid on my own.”</p><p>“I know it’s not really any of my business,” Rio said. “But do you want to talk about it?” </p><p>“Honestly, not really.” </p><p>“And <em> should </em> you talk about it?” Fuck, Rio sounded like she’d been talking to Wanda.</p><p>“Probably,” Agatha acknowledged. She shifted, pulling one knee up so her foot was resting on the chair. “But let’s talk about your shit first. What’s driven you into the arms of nicotine?” </p><p>Rio sighed, and Agatha noticed the soft shadows underneath her eyes. She looked defeated and worn out, nothing like Agatha had ever seen her.</p><p>“I met with my advisor today about this paper I have to submit before the end of the summer semester,” Rio said. “It’s about the philosophical frameworks behind educational pedagogy, which is just a mouthful that means why we teach the way we do,” she snorted. </p><p>Her hand flexed where it was resting on the table. “She tore it to shreds. I pretty much have to start from the beginning.”</p><p>“So you scrunched it into a ball and left it on one of my chairs,” Agatha replied, lifting an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>“That I did,” Rio nodded, eyes falling to her cigarette. She took another long, slow inhale, eyes cast out towards the city. “I didn’t want to look at it any more.” </p><p>“I’m sure it’s not that bad,” Agatha reassured. Maybe this was her opportunity to help, to present Rio with some of the same kindness she was always handing around so easily. “I don’t have a clue about teaching, but I know good writing. I can read it, if you like. Give you a second opinion.”</p><p>“Really?” Rio’s eyes locked back onto hers, hopeful. Agatha nodded.</p><p>“That’d be… so great,” she exhaled gratefully. “Thank you.” </p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha said simply. <em> See, Harkness? </em> she thought. <em> That wasn’t so hard. </em></p><p>Rio stubbed out her cigarette and stood up from the table. “Hey, I’m gonna grab a beer. Want anything?”</p><p>“A soda would be good. Thanks.”</p><p>While she was gone, Agatha turned her attention to the view in front of her. She’d been so consumed by the conversation—by that bone-tired, frustrated look in Rio’s eyes—that she hadn’t noticed the sun dip lower in the sky. The streetlights had flickered on outside, and now, New York was lit up in all its glory, skyscrapers twinkling in the distance.</p><p>A minute or so later, Rio ambled back onto the balcony, holding their drinks. She set the Coke in front of Agatha and relaxed back into her chair, taking a swig of her beer. “So, you were saying earlier?”</p><p>“Oh, we’re back to me, are we?”</p><p>Rio raised both eyebrows at her, a stern, knowing look on her face. “Friends talk, Agatha. What’s eating at you?”</p><p>It was a simple question. No pressure, no agenda—just a quiet offering to share the load. Wanda probably would’ve prodded at her, kind but pestering. Jen would’ve rolled her eyes and changed the subject. Ralph would’ve just ignored her and started talking about himself, like he always did. </p><p>But Rio just waited. “How long do you have?” Agatha replied wryly.</p><p>Rio gestured at the empty space around her. “There’s no one else here. It’s a beautiful night. And I have a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other. You’ve got my full attention.”</p><p>So she told her the story—or, at least, her version of events. Rio sat and listened quietly as she talked about Ralph, their rocky relationship, how Wanda had always hated him and implored Agatha to admit she was too good for him. How they’d been together for seven years, but Ralph had never wanted to get married, and after a while, Agatha hadn’t either.</p><p>Rio nodded supportively as she recounted finding out she was pregnant, then narrowed her eyes and clenched her jaw once she got to the part where Ralph left.</p><p>Finally, Agatha reached the part where her story intersected with Rio’s. Where her life as she’d known it ended and a different one, the one she was currently navigating, began. </p><p>She exhaled deeply as she finished, letting the weight of unloading on someone who was an impartial third party—someone other than Wanda, with her thinly-veiled asides and jabs at Ralph—settle around her.</p><p>Rio had been mostly quiet throughout Agatha’s monologue, only offering a <em> hmm </em> or an encouraging nod here and there. When she sensed Agatha was done, she spoke. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad you’re not with him anymore,” Rio said, leaning across the table.</p><p>Agatha wanted to say <em> me too</em>, but something about those words felt a little too intimate.</p><p>She remembered what Jen had said at coffee, and a shred of doubt began to surface. Her heart hammered in her chest as she averted Rio’s gaze. <em> She didn’t</em>, she thought. <em> She couldn’t</em>. </p><p>Desperately seeking an anchor, Agatha turned her focus to Rio’s tattoos, more exposed than she had ever seen them, the dimming light turning her skin gold.</p><p>They ran the length of her right arm from shoulder to hand, with space in between clusters of ink. Each one was beautiful, some in the same style, but a few obviously older than others; more faded, the lines blurring and softening. There were a few pieces of script interspersed with the designs, but she’d never been able to read them—had never gotten close enough to. </p><p>“See something you like?” </p><p>Agatha tipped her chin up abruptly, like she’d been caught. She supposed she had—she couldn’t deny she’d been staring. But it was just curiosity. She was a writer, after all. Curiosity was embedded in her nature.</p><p>“Do they mean anything, or do you just like letting people scribble on your body with needles?”</p><p>Rio’s comeback was almost instant. “You,” she said, eyes focused on Agatha’s intently, “are so fucking annoying. I mean that, truly.”</p><p>She bit back another laugh before Rio continued. “But yes, they mean something. Well, most of them,” she said, tongue playing at the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t blame what she did next on alcohol, seeing as she was pregnant and had only chugged half a Coke. So maybe it was something about the scene unfolding—the dusky twilight, the heat of the summer air, the cigarette smoke encasing the two of them—that emboldened her. </p><p>“Tell me about one,” she said, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted into a smirk. “Which one?”</p><p>Agatha leaned over, something weird and unnameable and magnetic compelling her to reach out and touch. She noticed as Rio’s eyes followed her hand. She tapped a finger against the sunflower on Rio’s inner forearm gently. “This one.” </p><p>Rio hummed. Agatha couldn’t tell if it was good or bad—it just sounded… contemplative. Like she was deciding how much of her story to share.</p><p>“That one I got after lots and lots of therapy.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. <em> Kind of an odd reason to get a tattoo</em>, she thought.</p><p>“It was a significant thing for me,” Rio continued, answering her question like she’d said it out loud. “I didn’t always have the best outlook on life. Therapy was the thing that changed that the most.”</p><p>It inched her understanding of who Rio was forward a little. Someone who had been through hard things, but who had learned how to deal with them. It stood out starkly against the chaos of Agatha’s own life, all the half-processed issues miring her down.</p><p>“Is that your thing?” she asked curiously. “After a big life event you get a tattoo?” She couldn’t count them all, but she guessed Rio had at least 20 tattoos just on that one arm—evidence of a life thoroughly lived; of unseen moments good and bad. </p><p>“Something like that, yeah.” </p><p>“Still got a lot of space for more living, then.” </p><p>“I’m working on it,” Rio agreed, beer bottle raised to her lips. “Do you have any?” </p><p>“No,” Agatha replied. “Always wanted one, though. Didn’t actually consider it ‘til my mom died, but it felt a little late to get my first tattoo when I was pushing 40.” </p><p>“Nah,” Rio shook her head. She sat her beer bottle down on the table with a clank. “Never too late. For anything.”</p><p>Maybe Rio had meant it as a throwaway comment, but Agatha felt the shift all the same. <em> Never too late. </em> Never too late to start again. To try. To shrug off some of the weight she’d been carrying around since childhood, wearing it like a backpack.</p><p>Never too late to re-examine the person she was, the one she’d become without even realising it.</p><p><em> Christ</em>. When had she become so introspective? “Mm, I don’t know if that’s true,” Agatha wondered aloud. “I thought it’d be too late for this,” she said, gesturing to her stomach.</p><p>“Ah, yes. The geriatric pregnancy,” Rio said solemnly, like she was diagnosing a terminal illness.</p><p>“I say this with all the goodness in my heart, Rio. Shut the fuck up,” Agatha glared at her, folding her arms. </p><p>Rio one hand up in protest, her beer still clutched in the other. “Hey, according to my calculations, you’ve got 11 years on me. I’m just calling it like I see it.” There it was again—that whisper of a smirk, a hallmark of Rio’s easy confidence.</p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha sighed, lifting a hand to shield her face. “Don’t remind me.”</p><p>Rio just laughed softly. “It wasn’t too late, though, you know,” she said. “You’re doing it. You’re doing the hard thing.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s hand settle over the top of hers before she could flinch. She stared down at it, at tanned hands and long fingers.</p><p>Her grasp was loose, but it felt too hot, like her pulse was travelling through her fingertips. Agatha cleared her throat, pulling her hand away from Rio’s reach and standing up from the table. </p><p>She stretched, trying to erase some of the stiffness from her body, and looked back at Rio with a tight smile. “Wanna order some food?” she asked.</p><p>Rio took a beat, something resigned in her expression. Seeking, but not pushing. Finally she pressed her lips together in a calm smile. “Sure,” she said, eyebrows lifting. “But I get to pick.”</p><p>Agatha let her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke on the Fourth of July with an unnerving sense of anticipation.</p><p>Maybe it was dread for the day ahead, where she’d inevitably have to sidestep questions from Wanda’s miscellaneous friends and family about the baby and her sudden singledom.</p><p>Maybe it was the question of what was to come—how Rio, and by extension, Alice and Jen, would fit in with the Maximoffs. How much hand-holding she’d have to do to make sure they were at ease around her friends and her two very annoying, probing nephews.</p><p>Or maybe the morning sickness was just back. That sounded like the most reasonable answer.</p><p>She strolled into the kitchen, unable to sleep any longer thanks to the light that seeped in through the blinds of her bedroom. She’d been keeping them ajar for the last week or so, a promise to herself to wake up a little earlier. </p><p>Plus, the sunlight wasn’t that bad. Although she was loath to admit it, it reminded her that there was still life to be lived outside the walls of her bedroom. Places to go, things to do. People to talk to.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio’s voice rang through the room, breaking over the top of the whirring coffee maker, Agatha’s first stop of the day without fail.</p><p>“Morning,” she replied, not turning away from her task. While she’d gotten used to Rio’s relentless energy in the mornings, she was still incapable of doing or saying much before at least a sip or two of caffeine. There was definitely some kind of rule about coffee during pregnancy, but Agatha had ignored it like all of the other bullshit her doctor seemed to spout. Suggestions, really.</p><p>Once the coffee maker had calmed down and her mug was full of deep brown elixir, she shifted so her back was against the counter, now face-to-face with Rio. She was sitting on one of the stools, concentrated on her phone, a small smile on her face.</p><p>Agatha took a fortifying sip of coffee before she spoke. “Happy birthday.” </p><p>Rio looked up at her, brown eyes sparkling. “Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>“So how does it feel to be 32?”</p><p>She twisted her lips together for a minute, pondering the question. “Exactly the same as 31,” she answered. “Just ever-so-slightly more aware of death’s looming spectre.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “You want one?” she gestured at her coffee, pushing her glasses up her nose. She’d slipped them on that morning to read the <em> Times </em> in bed and had forgotten to take them off.</p><p>Rio considered the offer, then nodded. “Yeah, thanks,” she said warmly.</p><p>She turned back around to fish one of Rio’s mugs out of the drawer—the one with the cartoon frog on the front that looked like it’d been plucked straight from the sale rack at Target and dropped into her home, out of place in a sea of black ceramic. </p><p>The coffee maker sputtered a little before coming back to life, shooting out a stream of coffee into the green cup. Once it was done, she handed it to Rio, who accepted it with a grateful smile.</p><p>“So how are we getting to Jersey?” Rio asked, after draining half her coffee in one go.</p><p>“I’ll drive,” Agatha replied easily, leaning her elbows on the counter.</p><p>“You drive?” Rio asked disbelievingly. “Wait, you have a car?”</p><p>“Of course I have a car.” </p><p>“Agatha, we live in New York. Why the fuck do you have a car?” she sputtered. “And where is it?”</p><p>“In the garage underneath the building,” Agatha said plainly.</p><p>She stilled, taking in Rio’s puzzled expression. “Why are you looking at me like I have two heads?” </p><p>“I’m not,” Rio laughed. “You just never fail to surprise me, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha took another sip of her coffee. “Mm,” she said. “Full of surprises, that’s me.”</p><p>She didn’t know why she said it—historically, she <em> wasn’t </em>full of surprises, unless you counted her sharp tongue, which was definitely enough to catch anyone off guard. She was practical. Made predictable choices. Up until recently.</p><p>But Rio was looking at her like she agreed. Like she saw something that Agatha herself didn’t. </p><p>“Hey, come here,” Rio beckoned, already leaning across the counter. Agatha’s mouth went dry as she tracked her hand.</p><p>She plucked Agatha’s glasses from her face in one swift motion, then rubbed the lenses against her own shirt, cleaning off the finger marks Agatha hadn’t bothered to address. “Your glasses are so fucking dirty,” she chuckled, shaking her head. Once she was satisfied, she handed them back to her.</p><p><em> What the hell was that about? </em>she wondered. It wasn’t the gesture itself that unsettled her—it was the ease of it. The unspoken intimacy between them that Agatha didn’t remember agreeing to.</p><p>See, for the last week since they’d talked on the balcony, Agatha had been… noticing things. Things she didn’t have any business noticing.</p><p>Like the way Rio had made a cup of tea for her unprompted when she was hunched over her laptop in the living room one afternoon. When Agatha had questioned her, she’d just shrugged and set the mug in front of her, claiming she’d put too much water in the kettle.</p><p>Or the way that, upon returning home from work or school, she’d taken to falling onto the couch beside her and picking up a conversation like no time had passed. Sometimes they’d chat for a bit before falling into a comfortable silence, Agatha resuming her writing while Rio flipped through the TV channels or grabbed her textbooks to study.</p><p>And then there was the casual touching. A quick pat of her hand as Rio stood up to leave the room. A fleeting brush against Agatha’s waist as they manoeuvred around each other in the kitchen, Rio making dinner while Agatha heated something up in the microwave or grabbed a snack from the fridge. And now, this.</p><p>There were countless other things Agatha was diverting her energy to <em> not </em> thinking about. But she couldn’t help it—not with Jen’s question rattling around in her head. The boat had sprung a leak, and she either had to patch it up or dive overboard. And <em> god damn</em>, she had no clue what kind of surprises she’d find in the water below.</p><p>Agatha could be truly, 100% certain of one thing alone: Rio had infiltrated her way into her life. And to her dismay, she didn’t hate it. In fact, it felt kinda nice. Easy and comfortable, like they’d established a rhythm no one else knew how to follow. </p><p>It made the days go by quicker, and gave her something to look forward to in each one—something she’d never really had before. And she’d be crazy to question what that meant, or worse, do or say something to jeopardise it. </p><p>Still, she knew she couldn’t avoid it forever. </p><p>So maybe that’s what the anticipation was.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>An hour after finishing up their coffees, they were in Agatha’s ‘mysterious’ car, a sleek, black Mazda she’d owned for close to a decade but had barely driven 40,000 miles in. She didn’t need to—she lived in New York City, where the subway and cabs could get you anywhere—but she’d kept it for the occasional drive to Jersey to see Wanda.</p><p>And because she barely used it, Agatha’s driving skills were perhaps a little… rusty.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio yelped, bracing herself against the passenger seat as they sped through the Holland Tunnel. “Why didn’t you tell me that getting in a car with you meant risking my life?” </p><p>“Don’t be so dramatic,” Agatha tsked, but not before hazarding a quick glance over at her. Rio’s eyes were wild, and it almost made her want to ease up on the accelerator a little. </p><p>“It’s my <em> birthday</em>, Agatha,” she protested, lips turning downward into a pout. </p><p>“And I’m giving you the gift of efficiently getting us to our destination.” </p><p>“That’s if we make it there at all,” Rio groaned. “I don’t know if dying or getting arrested on your birthday is worse.”</p><p>“It’d be me getting arrested anyway,” Agatha brushed her off, training her eyes on the road in front of her. “My job is driving. Your job is music.”</p><p>Rio chuckled at this and reached over to grab Agatha’s phone, resting in one of the cup holders. She’d connected it to the Bluetooth when they’d gotten into the car, but hadn’t bothered picking a playlist yet—she didn’t want to give Rio another reason to worry by touching her phone.</p><p>“3825,” Agatha said, pre-empting the question.</p><p>She saw her key in the code out of the corner of her eye. She also saw Rio’s mouth twitch up when she realised what the code stood for.</p><p>“Setting FUCK as your passcode is the most you thing ever,” Rio giggled. Agatha let out an embarrassed huff of laughter in exchange. It was kind of uncanny, the way Rio could read her so easily.</p><p>After a beat of indecision on Rio’s part, an upbeat indie-pop song started playing. It effortlessly filled the quiet of the car, lifting the mood as Agatha wove through traffic and Rio pretended not to cling onto the door handle for dear life.</p><p>They pulled up to the Maximoffs’ house in Westview after a ruthless hour of speeding and braking. Rio flung the door open and threw herself onto the driveway once Agatha had parked, making a big show of finally being on stable ground again.</p><p>“You’ve sure got a lot of feedback for someone who can’t drive,” Agatha remarked, eyes cast down at Rio in all her glorious stupidity.</p><p>“Just because I can’t legally get behind the wheel doesn’t mean I can’t drive,” Rio hit back, standing up and brushing gravel off her palms. “And anyway, that thing’s an automatic. Don’t act like getting me here in one piece was some huge show of skill.”</p><p>Agatha swung her bag over her shoulder and walked around to the trunk, grabbing the cooler full of food and drinks they’d loaded in there earlier. Beer and veggie sausages for Rio, soda and burgers for Agatha, along with a couple of sides she’d grabbed from the bodega in a last-ditch attempt to be a good house guest.</p><p>Rio walked around and took it from her hands without a word.</p><p>“Talk to me when you grow up and get your license, sweetheart,” Agatha rolled her eyes, closing the trunk. The pet name, as obnoxious and needling as it was, slipped out of her mouth a little too easily.</p><p>A challenge flashed in Rio’s eyes. “I have my license, <em> sweetheart</em>.” She paused for effect. “My motorbike license.”</p><p>Huh. That was… interesting—although the idea of Rio flinging herself around on a motorbike didn’t seem particularly at odds with her whole vibe. <em> I bet that gets you all the girls</em>, Agatha thought off-handedly.</p><p>“Oookay, <em> Sons of Anarchy</em>,” she joked. “Let’s go inside.”</p><p>She ushered Rio down the driveway, saying a silent prayer that they’d be able to slip into the party without drawing much attention to themselves. But God hated her—and Wanda was already standing against the front door to the house, smirking with her arms folded.</p><p>“Hi!” she called, waving in their direction. Her hair was loose and wavy, and she was wearing a bright red summer dress, colour-coordinated as always.</p><p>“Rio, it’s so nice to finally meet you. Happy birthday!” Wanda greeted Rio joyfully, hands outstretched. Agatha watched on as Rio slipped seamlessly into Wanda’s embrace and straight into her good graces. Of course she’d managed to charm her best friend without saying a word—no surprises there.</p><p>“Thanks so much for inviting me,” Rio smiled.</p><p>“You can put your cooler out back,” Wanda gestured down the hallway and towards the garden, where Agatha could see Billy loitering. He gave Rio a casual wave and beckoned for her to follow.</p><p>“See ya out there,” Rio said, shooting an easy grin in Agatha’s direction as she walked away.</p><p>“Hi, hon,” Wanda reached for Agatha once Rio was out of earshot. Agatha murmured hello and tried to pull away, but Wanda had her in a vice grip disguised as a hug. Nothing good could come of this, and it wasn’t just Agatha’s aversion to physical contact that was setting off alarm bells. </p><p>“<em>Sweetheart</em>?” Wanda whispered pointedly into her ear. “Why do you guys sound like an old married couple all of a sudden?”</p><p>Agatha froze, heat rising in her cheeks. For fuck’s sake, it had meant nothing—yet by a cruel twist of fate or circumstance, Wanda had heard it. One slip of the tongue, and now she was going to turn this into a thing. A thing she herself was actively, earnestly trying to avoid.</p><p>She schooled her expression into something akin to boredom and pulled back, looking Wanda in the eyes. “Oh, come on. I call everyone sweetheart. I think I called the bodega guy sweetheart this morning.”</p><p>“That’s a lie, but I applaud you for your creativity,” Wanda said, shepherding Agatha into the house.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>The morning passed by breezily, a flurry of conversations and music and people playing lawn games while Agatha looked on from the deck chair she’d co-opted. Jen and Alice arrived about an hour after them, and they easily slotted into the group, Wanda complimenting Jen’s dress (pink, ruffled) and Alice’s necklace (silver, heavy, reminiscent of a medieval torture device).</p><p>Agatha had to give it to her—Wanda knew how to host a party. She’d decked the back garden out with fairy lights and a couple of red lanterns, but thankfully, hadn’t gone in too hard on the patriotic theme. She didn’t feel like having a conversation about politics or nationalism with anyone’s uncle, thank you very much.</p><p>Plus, she had a sneaking suspicion that if someone got Rio onto the topic of the Fourth of July’s origins, she’d have a lot to say about slavery. And racism. And sexism.</p><p>From her position on the exterior of the group, Agatha’s eyes drifted over to Rio. She was playing one of the lawn games with Alice, Billy, and Tommy, arm outstretched as she tried to roll a pin towards a ball or something just as inane. Clearly, she’d achieved what she had set out to do, because when the pin landed, she let out a triumphant whoop and threw her arms into the air. </p><p>“I am the champion!” Rio crowed, her hair catching the breeze as she pranced around, gloating. Alice was grinning, head tilted in Jen’s direction where she stood on the sidelines, half-watching like a dutiful girlfriend while she talked to Vision and sipped a beer.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Wanda appeared next to her, as if the devil himself had summoned her. </p><p>Agatha jumped. “No, I’m not,” she covered, focusing on the condensation that was sliding down her red solo cup, a byproduct of the scorching day. “She’s just… intense.”</p><p>“Yeah, she kinda is,” Wanda admitted, an amused look on her face as her eyes flicked between Agatha and Rio. “But I don’t think anyone cares. Least of all, you.”</p><p>“She just—I don’t know, fascinates me, in a way,” Agatha sighed. “Like, she’s so completely herself. It’s admirable. And a little unsettling.” </p><p>Wanda didn’t say anything in reply, but Agatha could <em> feel </em> her looking.</p><p>Across the yard, Rio caught her eye—like she’d felt it too. Her smile softened for half a second, and she offered a quick wave before turning back to say something to Alice and the boys.</p><p>“You know, you seem like you’re doing a lot better than when I came over a couple weeks ago,” Wanda mused. “Not as… burdened. Your angst levels are way less alarming.”</p><p>“Yes, Dr Maximoff,” Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Honey, I’m not trying to be your therapist. That’ll cost you $100 an hour,” she joked. “I’m just glad you’re okay. And maybe a little curious as to why.”</p><p>
<em> Nope. </em>
</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha called out, swiftly rising from her chair. Her nephew whipped his head around to look at her, face lighting up. “Give me the fucking baton, or whatever.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes glinted once she saw Agatha walking towards them. She mimed throwing an invisible lasso in her direction and pulling her in, and<em> oh god</em>, she was so fucking dumb. </p><p>This time, she wasn’t sure if she was referring to herself or Rio.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After a game or two where Agatha had proven she was terrible at anything that required hand-eye coordination, everyone sat down to eat—a welcome reprieve from the sports of it all. In a surprise to no one, Rio and Tommy had dominated the pins-and-batons game, trading off wins and exchanging just as many teasing insults. </p><p>If Agatha hadn’t been there for their introduction earlier that day, she would’ve guessed Rio had known the Maximoffs their entire lives—they just <em> clicked</em>. It gnawed at something deep in her chest, seeing them all together. Seeing how easily Rio interacted with the people she cared about.</p><p>Rio navigated the lunchtime conversation with the same confidence and ease, but not without a few asides meant for Agatha’s ears only. </p><p>“How do you survive family events with that little showoff?” she murmured, gesturing to Tommy, who was waving his fork around as he told a convoluted story about an exploding science project.</p><p>“Booze, usually,” Agatha replied dryly. “Shit outta luck this time, though.” Rio chuckled and took a long pull of her beer. At least one of them could drink.</p><p>Later, when a work friend of Wanda’s asked Jen and Alice how they met, Rio leaned in close to Agatha before either of them could answer. “Tinder,” she whispered. “And don’t let them tell you otherwise.” </p><p>Agatha let out a loud snort, drawing Jen’s ire from across the table.</p><p>Once everyone finished off their burgers and hotdogs, Wanda stood up from the table and disappeared inside before Agatha could feebly offer to help. She’d probably just flick her off, anyway—the perks of being pregnant.</p><p>A few minutes later, her best friend re-emerged from the house, red hair blazing in the summer sun as she carried a cake topped with more candles than Agatha could count. </p><p>As Wanda walked over to the group, they briefly made eye contact. She’d said nothing to Agatha about a cake for Rio, but it was so perfectly in-character, she wasn’t remotely surprised. </p><p>Rio, on the other hand, definitely was. She’d clocked the cake too, and was now doing an exceedingly bad job of hiding her embarrassment as the group launched into an off-key rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’.</p><p>Agatha looked over at Rio, pressing her lips together apologetically. <em> I’m sorry</em>, she mouthed in her direction—but she couldn’t tamp down her amusement at the whole situation. Her shoulders shook with silent laughter as Wanda placed the cake at the head of the table and ushered Rio over. </p><p>Rio looked like she was praying for the earth to swallow her whole. But, she let herself be dragged to her feet by Billy anyway, and took her rightful place in front of the cake as everyone sang and cheered.</p><p>“Make a wish,” Billy clapped his hands excitedly. “Oh, and don’t touch the bottom when you cut it, otherwise you’ll have to kiss the closest boy… which is me.” </p><p>“That sounds like a pretty raw deal for both of us, kid,” Rio joked, before pulling her hair away from her face and leaning down to blow out the candles. Alice grabbed her phone to take a photo, and despite her initial embarrassment, Rio beamed—before raising both hands to give the camera the finger.</p><p>Agatha watched on while Rio took the knife from Wanda with a heartfelt ‘thank you’ and began to cut careful pieces of the cake, waggling her eyebrows at Billy, no doubt threatening to scrape the serving plate and send him into a spiral. </p><p>Bit by bit, the rest of the crowd went back to their conversations and their final scraps of food, until it was just the boys and Wanda gathered around Rio, Agatha still listening in from a couple of chairs down.</p><p>“What’d you wish for?” Tommy asked through a mouthful of cake.</p><p>Rio hummed for a second, considering her answer. She swiped one finger through her own slice, collecting the white frosting.</p><p>“Well, if I tell you, it might not come true,” she smirked. </p><p>Her eyes didn’t even reach Tommy’s as she said it. She was too busy pinning her gaze directly on Agatha as she drew her finger into her mouth and licked off the sugary frosting.</p><p>It wasn’t seductive, exactly—more playful, if she had to guess—but it still sent panic shooting up her spine.</p><p>She needed to go somewhere else. Anywhere else. <em> Now</em>. </p><p>“I’m gonna clean some of this up while they’re cutting the cake,” Agatha stood up abruptly, grabbing Wanda by the wrist. “Come help me?”</p><p>Wanda looked confused for a second, but clearly something in Agatha’s expression said <em> don’t fuck with me right now</em>, because she dutifully collected a handful of paper plates and followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>After tossing her own collection of plates and cups and empty trays into the trash, Agatha leaned her elbows on the counter, head in her hands. Through the gaps between her fingers, she could see Wanda looking at her curiously, teeth worrying at her lower lip.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda started. “What’s going on? Is it something I said earlier, because—” </p><p>“Do you think Rio likes me?” Agatha interrupted her. Her voice came out differently to how she’d expected—edgy and insecure, rather than cool and nonchalant. “Because Jen mentioned something the other day when we had coffee, and now I can’t get it out of my fucking head.”</p><p>“You’re asking me if I think Rio has feelings for you?” Wanda clarified. Agatha nodded, head bobbing up and down rapidly.</p><p>Wanda hesitated, twisting a ring around one finger. “I was wondering when you’d figure it out.”</p><p>Well, that was her worst fear out in the open. Another thing that everyone had seemed to see but her—and this one was beginning to feel indisputable.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groaned, covering her face again. She didn’t want to see what might be written on Wanda’s—pity, judgement, a shit-eating grin. Probably a combination of all three. </p><p>Eyes squeezed shut, Agatha felt Wanda reach for one of her hands and pull it free. “Look at me, Agatha.”</p><p>She reluctantly cracked an eye open and glared at her best friend, who looked… <em> ugh</em>, she couldn’t read her. Goddamn passive therapist face.</p><p>“What are you thinking right now?” Wanda asked gently.</p><p>“I’m thinking that I should’ve picked up on this, and I don’t know why it took two people meddling in my personal life for me to see it.” She took a moment to collect herself before speaking again. “What exactly is it that makes you think she likes me?”</p><p>“It’s kinda obvious, hon,” Wanda chuckled. “I’ve spent one day around the two of you, and I can say without a single doubt, that girl looks at you like you’re the only person in the room. Hell, she treats you like you’re the only person in the room.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled forcefully. She supposed Wanda was right—Rio <em> did </em> treat her well. And up ‘til now, she’d rationalised the absolute fuck out of that concept. <em> Rio was kind, Rio was good, Rio was charming. </em> But the pendulum was starting to swing the other way.</p><p>She looked up at the Maximoffs’ ugly popcorn ceiling and tried to gather the courage to ask her next question. “So, in this hypothetical world where Rio has feelings for me… what do I do now?”</p><p>“I can’t answer that question for you. But what’s your gut telling you?” </p><p>“My gut is telling me that I feel sick <em> all </em>the time, and I don’t think it’s the baby’s fault.”</p><p>Wanda just looked at her, probing without saying a word.</p><p>“I don’t know, Wanda,” Agatha moaned again, stretching out every syllable like it pained her. “How do you figure out whether you have feelings for someone back without, like… actually dating them? Or sleeping with them?”</p><p>“You are so damn obtuse sometimes, it’s alarming,” Wanda muttered. Agatha chose to ignore it, instead just waving a hand urgently in her direction to get her to keep going. </p><p>“Start with the basics. How do you feel when you’re around her?” </p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. Vulnerability was so overrated, which is probably why it’d taken her four decades and then some to try it. But she <em> was </em>trying it—and although she loved to poke, and chide, and call her out on her bullshit, Wanda was safe.</p><p>She let out another breath and willed her pulse to calm down. “I feel… good,” she admitted. “Happier. Like my problems aren’t as… heavy.” </p><p>“Honey,” Wanda looked at her again. This time, it was definitely pity. “I feel like that’s all you really need to know.”</p><p>“Yeah, but…” Agatha trailed off, frustrated at herself. “What about the other stuff? I like spending time with her, but I don’t know if I want to <em> be </em> with her. And I—” she said, voice breaking. “<em>Fuck</em>.” She wrung her hands and felt the hot tears pricking at her eyes before she could stop them.</p><p>Wanda laid a comforting hand on her arm, a gentle nudge to continue when she was ready.</p><p>“I just don’t know how to figure out how I feel,” she finally bit out, reaching up to swipe at her eyes. These pregnancy hormones were no joke.</p><p>“You don’t have to figure it out this second,” Wanda replied softly. </p><p>Agatha wished she had an iota of the insight her best friend did—maybe she wouldn’t be in this situation right now, or half of the other ones she was dealing with, either. </p><p>“Remember what my sweet, intuitive, very wise son said to you the other day,” Wanda reminded her.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open. “That was a private conversation,” she complained. She’d get that Billy Maximoff if it was the last thing she did.</p><p>“You can’t keep <em> shit </em> from me, Harkness,” Wanda grinned widely, but Agatha couldn’t bring herself to match it with a smile of her own.</p><p>Wanda’s expression turned kind again. Maybe a little worried, if she had to guess. </p><p>“Hey,” she said, walking around to where Agatha was standing on the other side of the counter, gripping the marble like it was the one thing keeping her together.</p><p>“Take some time. Sit with your feelings,” Wanda continued, prompting a watery eye roll from Agatha. “And talk to someone when you feel more ready. Me, Rio, whoever,” she said, before hesitating. “Well, maybe not Jen. She’s far too quick to say ‘I told you so’.” </p><p>Agatha just nodded. She couldn’t even manage a laugh at Jen’s expense: she felt too uncertain and drained and <em> small</em>. All this emotional shit really took it out of a person.</p><p>“You wanna go back out there?” Wanda asked.</p><p>Agatha stared at the door that led out to the backyard. It felt like walking into a gunfight unarmed, but she didn’t really have a choice.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, still sounding miserable. Honestly, she felt a little miserable. How a simple solution to paying her mortgage had turned into <em> Agatha Harkness vs Every Feeling She’d Ever Bottled Up</em>, she’d never know. All she knew was that she was losing, hard.</p><p>Wanda plucked a tissue from a box on the counter and reached for Agatha’s face, dabbing at the tiny clumps of mascara that had accumulated beneath her eyes. She didn’t say anything about the stray tears that had slipped out. Small mercies.</p><p>“There,” Wanda smiled, tossing the tissue into the trash can behind them. “Good to go.”</p><p>When she and Wanda emerged from the kitchen, Rio sidled up to her right away. She waved a paper plate with a slice of birthday cake in Agatha’s direction. “Saved you a piece.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>“Ugh,” Rio exhaled as they slipped into the car later that evening. “I’m so done with people.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow crumpled into a frown. It had been a long day—for everyone, if her own outburst in the kitchen was anything to go by. But Rio had flitted from one animated conversation to the next like it was nothing. She’d talked to practically everyone at the party, held court with all the kids, and to Agatha’s amusement, won most of the lawn games.</p><p>Even after all the attention had been turned on her, which she had clearly hated, she’d brushed it off and spent the rest of the evening deep in conversation with Jen, Alice, and Agatha, their chairs arranged in a tight circle to deter uninvited participants from joining in.</p><p>So, her statement made zero sense. Or at least, it would have to the Agatha from 12 hours ago. </p><p>“You love people,” Agatha said doubtfully. “You’re like the biggest extrovert I know.”</p><p>Rio pulled a disgusted face in her direction. “I hate people, Agatha,” she intoned seriously. “I just like <em> my </em>people. I could take or leave the rest of ‘em.”</p><p>And there it was—the final, pointy nail in Agatha’s coffin. Jen’s words had raised her suspicions. Wanda’s had sharpened them. But hearing it from Rio, though not in so many words, cemented it.</p><p>Rio liked her. She had to—it was the only explanation. The unbridled kindness. The way she always anticipated Agatha’s needs, like she was ever-present on her mind. The little touches.</p><p>There was still room for the possibility it was just friendly. Some people moved quick and loved their friends hard, and Agatha could sense that when Rio found ‘her people’, she was the type to latch on—her sisterly bond with Alice was evidence of that.</p><p>But she knew. <em> Oh god</em>, she knew. It wasn’t just friendship.</p><p>And she’d just been ignoring it, blinders on. </p><p>She started the car, fiddling with the air conditioning for something to do before pulling out of Wanda’s driveway and onto the road. The interior of the car was stuffy from a long day of being parked in the blazing sun.</p><p>“So, did you have a good time?” Rio asked, blissfully unaware of what was going on inside Agatha’s head.</p><p>“I did,” Agatha agreed. “What about you?” she asked tentatively. “Birthday everything you’d hoped it would be?”</p><p>“Best birthday I’ve had in years.” </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Hey, open the glove compartment,” she said, fixing her eyes on the road ahead of her. She couldn’t see Rio’s expression in her periphery, just her hand as she reached in and found the bundle of brown paper Agatha had stashed there earlier.</p><p>She’d thought about giving it to her at the barbecue, when there were people around and she could just hand it off and disappear. But she’d let that moment pass her by, too consumed with cornering Wanda for an impulsive psychological evaluation—so it was now or never.</p><p>Agatha heard the crumpling of the paper as Rio ripped it open. Suddenly, she regretted doing this while she was driving, gripped by an overwhelming desire to watch Rio’s reaction to the gift, to the message she had scrawled on a piece of notebook paper in lieu of the card she’d forgotten to buy.</p><p>The present was silly, really. A book about serial killers that she’d asked Sharon to special order for her. And a proper lighter, better than that Bic piece of shit Rio had left out on the balcony table. This one was green with an ornate silver leaf design running across it. She knew she probably shouldn’t encourage Rio’s vices, but it was pretty, and it reminded her of her.</p><p>And then there was the note: <em> Thanks for being your annoying self. I’m lucky to have you in my life</em>. <em> Happy birthday, Rio. </em> - <em> A xo </em></p><p>The car fell quiet for a second as Rio observed the gift, the road and the soft music playing through the speakers the only audible sounds.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed. “This is really nice.”</p><p>While she didn’t love the idea of getting into a car accident right now, Agatha couldn’t help but tear her eyes away from the road—it was all stop lights and traffic anyway—and look at Rio, turning over the lighter in her hands.</p><p>“I mean it,” Rio said, brown eyes flicking up to meet Agatha’s. She glanced down at the lighter again, thumb tracing the silver leaf. “It’s perfect.”</p><p>That look was enough to make Agatha wonder how she’d been so damn blind.</p><p>In a way, it should’ve been a relief. It was confirmation, or as close as she could get without putting her big girl pants on and actually asking Rio about it.</p><p>But the hard part was only just starting—the part where she had to untangle her <em> own </em> feelings. Still, beneath the confusion, there was a flicker of something familiar. Comfort, maybe. Or hope.</p><p>She gave Rio a small, cautious smile of acknowledgement. “Don’t get used to it,” she said lightly. </p><p>There was a waver in her voice she didn’t expect. Because she didn’t know anymore. Maybe she wanted to get used to it—or at least see what ‘it’ could be.</p><p>(She also wanted to take all these fucking feelings, shove them in a box, and throw them out onto the goddamn interstate. But that was beside the point.)</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>One of the downsides of being pregnant was spending a fuckload of time in doctor’s offices—which, if you asked Agatha, were some of the fakest places on earth. On the surface, they pretended to be warm and inviting, dog-eared magazines stacked on tables and shitty top 40 music echoing in the waiting room. </p><p>But it was all just a front to hide what really lay beneath: sickness. Discomfort. Fear. And, critically, the sizeable egos of people who thought they were god’s gift to humanity—doctors. </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha didn’t trust the medical profession. She was just <em> sceptical</em>, and that, to her, was healthy. The concept of other people, even those with hundred-thousand-dollar college degrees, knowing her body better than she did triggered a deep self-preservation instinct.</p><p>And yet, she’d accepted her fate when she’d decided to keep this baby. At least a year of poking, prodding, and too many fucking questions—about her, and eventually, about her kid. </p><p>Agatha made it through the first part of the appointment unscathed: the totally unnecessary weigh-in, the well-meaning scrutiny from the nurse about her symptoms and lifestyle.</p><p>She didn’t mention her caffeine intake, although in her defence, she was observing the one cup a day rule. No one had explicitly said <em> how big </em>that cup was meant to be, and she was ready to argue for it if anyone crossed her.</p><p>Then came the ultrasound. Agatha had already seen her baby on the first scan at 10 weeks pregnant, but it had been little more than a blob in a sac then, impossible to make out from the rest of its blurry grey-and-black surroundings.</p><p>Propped up on the bed with her shirt hiked up around her bra, she waited quietly while the nurse covered her stomach in cold goop and fiddled with the ultrasound wand.</p><p>She remembered the panic she’d felt last time, expecting the worst but hoping for the best. It was still lingering, but the last few weeks had been so damn tumultuous that it had tucked itself away behind other, heavier thoughts.</p><p>“There we go,” the nurse cooed, in that voice medical practitioners clearly put on for expectant mothers to remind them of the miracle of life. </p><p>Agatha didn’t need reminding. It was, by all accounts, a fucking miracle she was pregnant. </p><p>She looked at the monitor as the nurse moved the wand around on her belly—just a small bump that could’ve easily passed for a big lunch.</p><p>This time, the image she saw was more defined, and it knocked the wind out of her. </p><p>She saw a head, a neck, two feet, and two hands. It was still alienesque, like a rough sketch of a baby done from memory, but <em> fuck </em>—there was a real human growing inside her. It even had a face; a little profile that she couldn’t quite make out as hers or Ralph’s or a mix of both.</p><p>“Everything looks good,” the nurse appraised.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, searching for any hint of worry or a lie. When she didn’t find it, she smiled, relief washing over her.</p><p>“I could make an educated guess at baby’s sex from this ultrasound, but it wouldn’t be for sure. We’re better to wait for your anatomy scan at 20 weeks,” the nurse explained. </p><p>Agatha nodded absently. She didn’t really know if she wanted to find out, anyway. On one hand, she loved to be prepared—but gender roles were outdated, and it wasn’t like she had a nursery to decorate. That little fantasy had gone out the window the second Ralph left. </p><p>Now, her baby’s room belonged to the kind, charming, sometimes-strange woman who’d been plaguing her thoughts for weeks.</p><p>She turned her attention back to the screen. “Can you print this?” Agatha asked. The hope in her voice bled out into the quiet room. </p><p>The nurse smiled warmly at her. “Of course. I’ll have it ready for you when you leave.”</p><p>After getting cleaned up and pulling her shirt back down, Agatha opened the adjoining door to her obstetrician’s office. He was a middle-aged man with greying hair and nondescript facial features whose name she always forgot—Goldman, Goldstein, Gold-<em>something</em>. </p><p>“Agatha,” he greeted her without standing up from his desk. “Take a seat.” </p><p>She sat, eyeing the nameplate on his desk. <em> Dr Goldberg</em>, it read. That was it.</p><p>“How’s everything going?” he asked lightly.</p><p>Agatha tried not to scoff at the question. <em> Mmm, my boyfriend left me, my book’s just a mess of words in a Google Doc right now, and, oh yeah—everyone seems to think I’m gay and have feelings for my roommate. Who definitely has feelings for me. So, just peachy, doc. </em></p><p>“Fine,” she lied.</p><p>“Morning sickness let up since we put you on those new meds?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s a lot better now. Only chucking up my guts every so often,” she quipped. Dr Goldberg chuckled nervously, running a hand over his bald spot before switching focus to the computer screen.</p><p>“I called you in because there’s something we need to discuss.”</p><p><em> Oh, that was never good. </em>Agatha felt the blood drain from her face, the easy smile she’d been wearing since seeing her baby on the ultrasound gone in a flash.</p><p>The ticking of the clock on the wall seemed to grow louder as they sat in silence for a second, Agatha pre-empting Goldberg’s next words. He didn’t appear to notice how she fidgeted in the uncomfortable plastic chair. Her face was a mask of indifference, but her body was actively trying to betray her.</p><p>“Because of your advanced maternal age,” the doctor started, gaze flicking back to Agatha just as she rolled her eyes defensively. He cleared his throat and continued. “You’ll need an amniocentesis. It’s a test to diagnose things like birth defects and genetic abnormalities. It involves inserting—”</p><p>“I know what it involves,” Agatha snapped, cutting him off. “Sticking a giant fucking needle into my womb.” </p><p>“Well, that's only partially correct, but…” He trailed off, smiling sympathetically. </p><p>She pinched the bridge of her nose between her thumb and forefinger, fixing the doctor with a stony glare. This could <em> not </em>be happening. “Is there any world where I don’t have to do it?”</p><p>“It’s elective, but highly recommended,” he replied, clearly trying to be gentle lest Agatha fly off the handle in his very calm, very sterile office. “For mothers your age, the risk of not diagnosing a potentially life-threatening issue now far outweighs the risk of performing an amnio.”</p><p>“I thought you could see everything on the scans these days.” </p><p>“A lot, but not everything. An amnio is the only way we can be sure.” </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha gritted out. The room was spinning. “When?”</p><p>“I can get you in for later this week. How’s Friday?”</p><p>She didn’t need to pull out her phone to check her calendar. Her social life was worryingly light-on for the middle of summer in New York—Friday was fine. “Yep,” she agreed tightly. She willed her heart to calm down, but it took no notice, beating arrhythmically in her chest. </p><p>Dr Goldberg nodded, clicking the computer mouse a few times. “You’ll need to arrange someone to come with you to help you get home afterwards.”</p><p>She nodded, eyes pressed closed. Yet another thing to add to the list. She’d call Wanda when she got home—when she’d had some time to herself to process exactly what this all meant. “Okay.” </p><p align="center">———</p><p>On the train ride home, Agatha went down a rabbit hole, Googling everything she could about the procedure and panicking when she lost reception in the tunnels. Research felt like the only way to cope with a spiral of this magnitude—to pack every corner of her brain with indisputable information; with facts instead of feelings. </p><p>Her frantic searches didn’t turn up anything alarming. It should’ve been enough to put her at ease—the risks were, by all accounts, minimal, like Dr Gold-<em>whatever </em> had reassured her. But it didn’t. For someone who dealt solely in rational thoughts, Agatha felt more beholden to her fluctuating emotions than ever.</p><p>She held it together as the subway stops ticked by, people filtering in and out of the carriages on their way home from work. When she exited at Lorimer Street, she strode the few blocks back to the apartment in silence, too concentrated on reaching her destination to put in her headphones.</p><p>It wasn’t until she walked through the door and collapsed onto the couch that the dam finally broke.</p><p>Crying wasn’t exactly in Agatha Harkness’s repertoire—or at least, she thought it wasn’t until she got pregnant. Everything she’d read had said hormones were supposed to calm down in the second trimester, but the days were ticking by, and she felt no less on edge. It was becoming a bona fide pain in her ass. </p><p>The tears rolled down her face—fast, hot, and unrelenting. She tried to blot at them with a tissue scrounged up from the bottom of her handbag, but they quickly gave way to that sobbing, snotting kind of cry that was powerless against paper. </p><p>This was silly. Every source she could find was telling her not to worry, not to blow this out of proportion. Millions of women probably had amnios every year and were completely fine. And the nurse had said everything looked fine—great, even.</p><p>But there was something about seeing that sweet profile on the screen today that had changed things, making everything feel way more real. And now that it was real, it was something she could actually lose.</p><p>Agatha exhaled heavily, hyper-aware of the fact that there was snot running down her face. She grabbed a big wad of tissues and mopped up the evidence.</p><p>The only way out of this was through, and making plans for the appointment on Friday seemed like the logical next step.</p><p>She tried calling Wanda twice, then three times, but she didn’t answer. Finally, a text came through. </p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> Hey hon, just about to get on the plane. I’ll call you when I land if it’s not too late there. </em>❤️</p><p><em> Fuck</em>. Agatha had forgotten Wanda was going out of town. She had reminded her about it at the barbecue last Friday—some week-long conference in California where all the best therapists in the nation got together, drank too much, and bitched about their clients within a cone of silence. </p><p>She’d be on the West Coast for ten days, stopping off to see a friend in San Francisco once the psychology circle-jerk wrapped up in LA. Which meant she wouldn’t be back until Thursday next week.</p><p>The gears turned in Agatha’s mind. If Wanda was out of the question, who would take her to her appointment? It wasn’t like she had a mother, or a partner, or other <em> friends</em>. Well—only the two that she could count. Dragging Jen along to her fucking OB/GYN’s office sounded about as palatable as rehashing their squabble in the middle of Times Square, so there was only one other option.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Something about asking Rio to come with her felt like crossing a boundary she couldn’t come back from. It was intimate, taking someone to the doctor’s—supporting them emotionally through a big, uncomfortable moment. The awareness that had been sitting in her periphery since the barbecue told her it wouldn’t be a good idea, not just for her, but for Rio.</p><p>But who else could she even ask?</p><p>After what felt like hours of wallowing, but was probably no more than twenty minutes, Agatha heard the soft jingling of keys in the front door lock. A fleeting thought emerged—she should go to her room. She didn’t need anyone seeing her like this.</p><p>But maybe she could use a distraction. Or some comfort. A bit of both would be nice, really. And, she supposed, now was as good a time as any to ask Rio if she wouldn’t mind being her emotional punching bag while a doctor sapped amniotic fluid out of her with a syringe.</p><p>“I’m home,” Rio called out. Agatha heard the soft sounds of her tossing her bag on the counter and opening a cupboard. She didn’t acknowledge her with a <em> hello,</em> but she didn’t move from the couch, either.</p><p>Rio wandered into the living room, hand buried in a packet of Cheetos. When she glanced up from her snack, her eyes fell straight to Agatha, brows knitting together in a worried frown.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, voice turning tender immediately, like it was instinctual. “What’s going on?” </p><p>Agatha waved a hand dismissively, but she knew she couldn’t come off aloof—the worry was etched into her face, her red-rimmed eyes giving her away. “It’s nothing,” she said shakily.</p><p>
<em> Good fucking god, here come the waterworks again. </em>
</p><p>“Doesn’t sound like nothing,” Rio replied gently. “Doesn’t really look like nothing either.” She gestured to where Agatha had cocooned herself beneath blankets, the A/C in the apartment set to a terrifyingly low number.</p><p>Rio didn’t have to prod her gently this time; to tell her that <em> friends talk, Agatha</em>. She just sat down on the armchair adjacent to her and propped her head in her hands, waiting.</p><p>“I need an amnio,” Agatha sighed. Her eyes felt salty, burning with unshed tears. </p><p>“Forgive me for not having a clue what that is,” Rio winced, dropping the bag of Cheetos onto the coffee table.</p><p>“They have to poke at the baby with a big needle to figure out if something’s wrong with it.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio breathed. She ran a hand through her hair. “That sounds fucking terrifying.” </p><p>Agatha nodded, clutching a throw pillow tightly.</p><p>“Is it… safe?” Rio asked. “Fuck, it’s cold in here,” she muttered off-handedly, wrapping her arms around herself.</p><p>“Can’t wallow without blankets,” Agatha shrugged. She lifted up a corner of one of the throws, a green hand-woven one she’d bought at some upscale homewares store in Manhattan, and looked at Rio expectantly.</p><p>If Rio felt any type of way about joining her, she didn’t show it. She just rose from the armchair, wandered around to the couch, and plonked herself down, thighs inches from Agatha’s. </p><p>Agatha sighed, drawing the blanket back around them both. “Google says it’s pretty safe. But there’s still a risk that I could…” she shuddered, “lose the baby. Or that they diagnose some life-threatening illness no one’s ever heard of.” </p><p>A single tear fell from her face and landed on the velvet of the cushion, leaving a dark, wet mark in its wake. She brushed at her eyes in frustration.</p><p>Rio drew in a sharp breath. “Oh, Agatha…” </p><p>And that made her crumple. The kindness in Rio’s voice, the obvious concern. She tried to blink back the tears, but they were falling hard and fast now. </p><p>Rio opened her arms, an invitation for a hug. She didn’t draw Agatha in—it was clear she was waiting for her to make the decision herself; to consent to being embraced in a way they’d never embraced before.</p><p>She fell into them wordlessly, as unconscious and easy as breathing. Rio snaked a hand around her shoulders, pulling her in closer. Their thighs were touching now, the only barrier between them the thin cotton of Agatha’s pants. </p><p>See, if this is what being with Rio could be like… maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. Having someone there to comfort you when you cried sounded pretty nice, even though Agatha hoped her crying days would soon be behind her. And Rio was so good at making her feel better—always on hand with an easy smile or a sweet gesture to bring her solace in dark moments.</p><p>It was just the other stuff that she couldn’t reconcile. Like what would happen if she let the absent-minded touches, the mere brushes of hands and thighs, escalate into something more. What it might trigger in her if she let it.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, steadying herself amidst the tears that were still escaping. Her cheek was pressed against Rio’s chest, making a mess of the button-up she was wearing, undone over one of her many ribbed tank tops. </p><p>“The doctor said I’m meant to have someone come with me. To the appointment.” Agatha kept her eyes trained on the wall in front of her, unsure of what she’d find if she looked up at Rio. “Wanda’s out of town ‘til the middle of next week, and it’s not like its dad is anything more than a sperm donor right now…” </p><p>She hadn’t asked directly, but the question was there—and Agatha found herself praying that Rio saw through her flimsy facade. </p><p>“When is it?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Friday.” </p><p>“I can be there,” Rio confirmed. </p><p>Even though she’d known deep down that Rio would agree without a second thought, it hit her hard. Not just Rio’s response—but her own reaction. The relief was palpable, and she felt it seep into her posture, relaxing into Rio’s hold a little more. Her arms were warm, and strong, and <em> safe</em>.</p><p>“Do you want me there?” Rio asked quietly, realising Agatha hadn’t said the words outright. She sounded unsure, like she was trying not to push again. </p><p>She could lie and claim it was out of necessity. The doctor had said she’d need someone to help her get home safely, and Rio was the easy choice—they lived in the same house.</p><p>And yet, Agatha was beginning to realise that denying your feelings got exhausting, even when you had 42 years of killer practice. So, although it was terrifying to admit to needing someone, she took a breath and said what she meant.</p><p>“Yes, please.” </p><p>She was even saying please now—god, she barely recognised herself.</p><p>Agatha had expected to feel weak once the words left her mouth; once she’d exposed the chink in her armour. But Rio never made her feel like asking for help was a burden. And maybe if Rio was okay with sharing in Agatha’s discomforts, she’d be okay with sharing in her joys, too.</p><p>“Do you want to see a picture?” Agatha asked quietly, looking up at Rio. She nodded back at her. </p><p>Agatha reached for her bag, sitting on the coffee table, and produced the ultrasound image. It was black and white and grainy, but it was also unmistakably <em> there</em>—the little demon that had taken up residence in her uterus. </p><p>She handed it to Rio, wondering what she’d say—whether she’d see fear written across her face, or awe. </p><p>Rio turned to her, eyes wide. A bit of column A, a bit of column B, if she had to guess. “That’s fucking wild.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha laughed, voice hoarse from all the crying. “It is.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>By the next day, Agatha felt a little calmer about the appointment darkening her calendar. Talking to Rio the previous night had helped, and knowing that she wouldn’t be alone while a doctor poked and prodded at her helped even more. </p><p>Still, she couldn’t shake it entirely—the invasiveness of the procedure, the miscarriage risk, the idea of putting her baby’s fate into the hands of some decaying quack with a god complex.</p><p>It was yet another thing out of her control. And Agatha had learned a lot about control in the last few weeks—mainly that she had way less than she’d originally thought.</p><p>All that tension had settled uncomfortably into her body overnight. Her sleep had been fitful, a daze of tossing and turning and waking up again, and now her shoulders and back were aching. After hours of pacing around the house in an unsuccessful attempt to loosen them, she’d given up trying and thrown herself on the couch, limbs sprawled out every which way.</p><p>When Rio had returned home from work, she’d taken one look at Agatha’s unbrushed hair and dirty joggers and uttered three words: “I’ll make dinner.”</p><p>And if Agatha was stubborn? Well, Rio was a damn mule, never one to take no for an answer, even amidst Agatha’s half-hearted protests. </p><p>While she got to work in the kitchen, Agatha let her mind wander, taking a journey of its own accord. Something about the setting sun and the breeze filtering in through the windows made her feel more introspective than usual. </p><p>She wondered if this was what it was like when you really, truly cared about someone—that you’d do literally anything for them without being asked, whether that was making them dinner or holding them while they cried. </p><p>She’d never felt that with anyone before. But Rio seemed to feel that way about her. </p><p>She picked at the thought a little longer. Would she do the same for Rio, if the roles were reversed? </p><p><em> Yes. </em> Of course she would—in a fucking heartbeat. </p><p>She’d make her dinner, although her cooking skills were limited to eggs on toast. She’d hold her while she cried. She’d read some essay on a topic she knew nothing about and give her feedback; hell, she’d rewrite the entire damn thing if she had to. She’d call up a bookstore she’d only been to once in months and put a rush order on an overpriced book about serial killers because she knew Rio would like it.</p><p>But would she kiss Rio? Stare into those brown eyes and pull her in, closing the gap between their bodies? Would she <em> fuck </em> her—let herself be fucked <em> by </em> her?</p><p>It made her shudder, how stark and raw those questions were. She didn’t know the answer to any of them, or how to even begin to find out.</p><p>The sound of Rio’s voice pulled her out of her interrogation spiral like a fishing line tugged tight. “Dinner’s ready,” she said, strolling into the living room with two plates and a dopey smile. </p><p>Agatha blinked. <em> What time was it? </em> Barely five minutes ago, Rio had been starting her prep—and now the food was done, the delicious scent of her cooking filling the apartment. It was like she’d blacked out, too deep in thought to register a single one of her senses.</p><p>Rio looked at her curiously, placing the bowl of pasta down in front of her. “Wanna watch something?” she asked easily, settling into place in the armchair. </p><p>“Uh, yeah,” Agatha stammered. Not only was all this thinking depleting her energy, but clearly, it was robbing her of her time, too. She looked at her watch—forty-five minutes had passed in the blink of an eye. <em> Time flies when you’re having an existential crisis</em>. </p><p>Rio had taken hold of the TV remote and was now flicking through Netflix, balancing her food on her knees. “Movie?” she questioned.</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha agreed through a mouthful of food. “You like horror?” </p><p>“Fuck yeah, I do,” Rio replied, selecting some C-grade slasher from Agatha’s watchlist and pressing play. “Didn’t pick you for a horror movie fan, though.” </p><p>Agatha laughed, just a quick puff of air. She rubbed her back absent-mindedly. “Love them. They’re so predictable.”</p><p>Which, now that she thought about it, was a blindingly obvious tell. The woman who gripped at control like a security blanket had a penchant for films that felt formulaic; where the ending was always the same? Shocking.</p><p>They sat and ate their pasta, and Agatha did her best to keep her eyes trained on the screen, letting herself be distracted by the arguably not-that-bad movie. Every now and again, though, Rio would let out a little gasp or a chuckle of laughter—clearly she agreed that horror movies were more funny than scary—and she couldn’t help but look over at her.</p><p><em> Am I attracted to this person? </em>she pondered, the screams of the TV fading away as her inner voice got louder.</p><p>No—she wasn’t doing herself any favours by keeping things vague. <em> Am I attracted to this </em>woman? </p><p>It skirted around the edges of her mind, all while the killer ran rampant on-screen, leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake. </p><p>Rio, meanwhile, was content to sit and watch, commentating whenever someone did something she thought was dumb or too funny not to acknowledge. </p><p>By the last ten minutes of the movie, Agatha was no closer to figuring her shit out. Worse, she was becoming aware of how sore she really was. She let out a small noise of discomfort, shifting in her seat.</p><p>“Are you just gonna keep groaning over there, or do you plan on telling me what’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio was watching her with a raised brow, focus shifted away from the movie where the bloodied final girl was now climbing into the back of an ambulance.</p><p>“I’m just sore,” Agatha huffed. “I’ve never slept so badly in my life. I need a new mattress.”</p><p>Rio stilled, considering something. “Do you…” she started, but trailed off as quickly as she began. She closed her eyes like she was trying to banish the thought, or steel herself to say it —maybe both.</p><p>That was odd. Rio wasn’t the type to shy away from saying things out loud. Like a dog with a bone, now Agatha <em> had </em>to know what Rio was holding back. </p><p>“What were you going to say?”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together in silent surrender. “I was going to ask if you wanted me to help.”</p><p>“What, you’re gonna buy me a new bed?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“No, Agatha,” she rolled her eyes. “But I can give you a massage, if you’d like.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flamed at the mere suggestion. </p><p>Oh. <em> That</em>. She’d conveniently tucked Rio’s special skill into the back of her memory, but here it was, rearing its head at what felt like an extremely inopportune moment.</p><p>She couldn’t let Rio do that. She couldn’t risk sending the wrong message, now that she knew how Rio felt. It would be cruel. </p><p>But maybe it would also be a solution. A way to finally discern between <em> this person makes me happy </em> and <em> I want more</em>. She hadn’t expected the opportunity to present itself to her so soon or so clearly. But the universe worked in mysterious ways, and she’d be an idiot to ignore the signs. </p><p>Her thoughts had been untrustworthy lately, but maybe her body would tell her the truth.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio pressed. “I’m a professional, after all.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. The girl made a good point. </p><p>(Although, come to think of it, Rio hadn’t mentioned much about taking massage clients recently—and she’d been home more often, too. Weird.) </p><p>“Okay, fine,” Agatha relented. “But be fast.” </p><p>The last thing she wanted to do was drag this out for either of them. All she knew for sure about this <em> thing </em> with Rio was that she didn’t want to hurt her, nor did she want to turn it into something it wasn’t if she didn’t feel the same way.</p><p>Leading Rio on was the worst-case scenario.</p><p>And the best-case scenario was… well, the jury was still out.</p><p>“Lie on your side,” Rio gestured towards the couch, where Agatha was already sprawled on her back, head tilted towards the TV.</p><p>She hit pause on the credits and obediently angled herself towards the couch cushions, away from Rio.</p><p>“Back and shoulders are what hurts, right?”</p><p>Agatha craned her neck so she could look back at her. Rio was sitting on the floor, stretching her arms above her head. Her t-shirt had ridden up, exposing a sliver of tanned, taut skin.</p><p>“Mm-hmm,” she murmured softly. <em> Why did this feel like stepping onto the edge of a cliff with no way to see what was waiting below?  </em></p><p>“Easy,” Rio replied. “Hang on, I’m gonna go grab some oil,” she said, jumping to her feet and padding down the hall.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. Something about using massage oil didn’t say ‘fast’ to her. Or convenient. Or, perhaps most critically, platonic.</p><p>And <em> jesus fuck </em> —if she was going to use oil, that meant Agatha would have to take off her shirt. She looked down at her clothes and breathed a sigh of relief when she remembered she was, in fact, wearing a bra. She sent a silent <em> thank you </em> to past Agatha for being so smart. </p><p>It didn’t quell the nerves that were building in her belly.</p><p>Rio returned a moment later, plopping back down onto the floor and scooting close to the edge of the sofa, knees pressing against the purple upholstery.</p><p>“Don’t be messy if you’re gonna use oil,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“I’ll be careful,” Rio promised. “Shirt off, please.” </p><p>Agatha inhaled, before gingerly reaching for the hem of her shirt and pulling it over her face. She tossed it on the end table beside her, draping it half-across a stack of books.</p><p>The air hit her skin, cool and bracing. <em> BandAid, ripped</em>, she thought, trying not to linger on the fact she was now half-naked in front of her roommate.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak for a minute, but she could hear her shifting around, maybe trying to get comfortable. Finally, she brushed a careful thumb over Agatha’s bra. “I’m gonna have to unhook this.”</p><p>Agatha knew it was what she wanted—what she needed—but the intimacy of it all came as a surprise. She felt her skin prickle under the contact, even though it was slight, mostly focused through the fabric.</p><p>“You can leave it half on, just hold a pillow or something so you’re covered up,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, so Rio didn’t take it any further, her hand slowly retreating from Agatha’s back. “We can just—I don’t have to use the oil,” Rio hesitated. </p><p>The uncertainty in her voice landed with a dull thud in Agatha’s chest. <em> Oh god,</em> was she pushing her too far? The instinct to set Rio at ease, to tell her not to worry about it, was overwhelming—but her need to know was stronger. </p><p>If this sent Rio into a spiral of her own… well, she just hoped she’d forgive her for it.</p><p>“No, no,” Agatha shook her head. She held her own chest with one hand and reached around herself with the other, pinching the clasp of her bra to set it free. “There.” Thankfully, the cups stayed firmly in place, giving her enough time to nestle back into the couch and pull a pillow tightly against her body.</p><p>“All good?” Rio asked. Agatha nodded, curling inward so her back was exposed. </p><p>Logistically, she had to turn away from her. It made sense—Rio couldn’t help her if she lay on her front or on her side facing outwards, and she wasn’t meant to put pressure on her stomach.</p><p>But as Rio’s hands made contact with her skin, she really,<em> really </em> wished she could look at her face. To connect the feeling of being touched for the first time in a long time with the person she was so desperately trying to see more clearly.</p><p>The pressure started light, careful—like she was testing the waters. They were both quiet as Rio’s thumbs ran over the tops of her shoulders before travelling down to knead gently at her upper back.</p><p>After a minute or two of contact, Rio pulled away. The loss immediately made itself known—the warmth of her hands and the firmness of her fingertips gone. </p><p>Agatha wanted to cut through the silence, but the words evaded her. Usually, she’d make some kind of snarky joke—<em> what, finished with me already?</em>—but that didn’t sit right when what she really wanted to say was <em> come back</em>. </p><p>Before she could open her mouth, Rio’s hands returned. They were even warmer this time, slippery with oil that smelled floral and spicy. She spread the wetness with her palms, tracing the length of Agatha’s back from the curve just above her joggers, all the way up to her shoulders. </p><p>Rio’s hands focused there for a moment, trying to ease some of the tension that had built up—that had been building there for weeks, long before that one terrible night of sleep. </p><p>Agatha concentrated on relaxing into Rio’s touch. <em> Let go</em>, the little voice in her head murmured, begging to be heard. Her body softened as Rio’s hands kept wandering over bare skin, languidly tracing the path she’d established. Shoulders to lower back, a rhythmic up and down.</p><p>As the minutes ticked by, Agatha became increasingly aware of the sensations in her body. On the surface, it was working—she could feel the ache in her body ebbing away, melting under firm fingers. </p><p>But what was occurring underneath it all felt indulgent, dangerous. Like a live wire sparking low in her belly, sending goosebumps rippling across exposed skin.</p><p>Rio’s hands stilled again, resting flat on her lower back. “You have a big-ass knot,” she tapped a spot, “right here.” Agatha hummed in agreement, vibrations echoing through the pillow.</p><p>“I’m gonna work a little harder on it,” Rio continued. Her tone was all-business—like this wasn’t lighting her up from the inside the way it was Agatha. <em> Good fucking god</em>, she wished she could see her face; to know what she was feeling. “Tell me if it hurts.” </p><p>Agatha didn’t protest. Pain would make more sense than whatever this was. Her whole body felt like it was on fire, flames stoked by the feeling of Rio’s hands on her and a mental tug-of-war only she was privy to. </p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into the sorest spot on her lower back, kneading deeper now, but still erring on the side of caution. “You can use more pressure,” Agatha said, voice hitching as she handed over permission.</p><p>Rio paused mid-motion. Then one of her hands drifted slightly, like she’d meant to return to the same spot but got caught on the curve of Agatha’s waist instead. Her fingers flexed once, then steadied.</p><p>When she found the knot again, she didn’t hold back. She dug into Agatha’s bare skin with ease, pressing deeper and deeper until—<em>oh, </em> that was the spot. <em> Right there, don’t stop</em>.</p><p>The pain was enough to make her wince, to clench her jaw and bury her face in the pillow. Rio faltered. “That too much?” </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Just enough.” </p><p>A lie. It wasn’t even in the ballpark of <em> enough </em>—just not in the way she’d expected. </p><p>She closed her eyes again, imagining what it would feel like if Rio’s hands didn’t stop at her lower back. If they were to travel further, palming her ass, tracing along the back of her thighs. If the pain was allowed to give way to pleasure.</p><p>The answer flared hot and needy between her legs before she could intellectualise it.</p><p>It was clarity in the form of a deep, resounding jolt to her clit and a moan she had to choke down. </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p>She resisted the urge to squeeze her thighs together as Rio’s hands kept going, unaware that a simple exercise in pain relief had quickly turned into an arduous back-and-forth.</p><p>She wasn’t thinking straight, not as her body hummed and her mind scrambled for a foothold. She didn’t know if she wanted to cry, come, or confess something.</p><p>All she knew was that Rio’s touch felt too close and too far away and she had to stop it now before she did something she couldn’t take back.</p><p>“That’s—that’s enough,” Agatha forced out, trying to keep her voice level. She felt Rio’s hands freeze before leaving her back a split second later. </p><p>The silence stretched out between them, spilling into every crevice of the apartment.</p><p>If Agatha had been bolder or more sure of herself, she might have asked: <em> Was that as good for you as it was for me?  </em></p><p>Instead, it was Rio who broke through the quiet. “Did that help?” she asked, careful and steady. </p><p>Agatha was still turned away from her, and while the desire to face Rio had been overwhelming earlier, now she couldn’t bring herself to make eye contact.</p><p>She eased her head from the pillow, feeling the indentations it had left behind, the traces of evidence written on her face. </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said slowly. Her own voice sounded disembodied, like it was very far away. “It helped a lot.”</p>

<p>Rio didn’t reply right away. The quiet pulsed between them again, but Agatha couldn’t connect the dots—not while she was faced away from her. She had to look at her, even though it felt like staring down the barrel of a very loaded gun.</p><p>She flipped over onto her side, securing her bra tightly shut, and found Rio watching her. Not with curiosity or concern, but… something else. It was charged, like electricity running between them. </p><p>Agatha wondered if she should say something. Maybe sharing her feelings with Rio, even in their messy, half-formed state, would be productive.</p><p><em> No</em>. Not yet, not with the pieces just beginning to lock together, still fragile enough to come apart under her hands. And not while she felt awkward, itchy, and extremely aware of her own arousal.</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” Rio finally said, averting Agatha’s gaze like she’d flipped a switch on purpose. She wiped the oil from her hands onto her shirt. </p><p>Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest. <em> Oh god</em>, she’d made Rio feel awkward, too—she could tell by the way she was fidgeting, rubbing her thumb along the edge of one finger to ground herself.</p><p>Her limbs felt shaky as she reached for her shirt from the end table and pulled it over her head quickly before standing. “I’m gonna go shower,” she said, altogether too casually. </p><p>Rio raised her head and nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. It was gentle and uncomplicated, so unmistakably Rio it almost hurt. </p><p>If Rio was upset or disappointed by what had just transpired between them, she didn’t show it. And if she was consumed in the way Agatha was, she couldn’t tell.</p><p>So, she fled to the bathroom before she could say something weird—or worse, make it obvious just how flustered she was.</p><p>When Agatha stepped into the shower, the bracing cold water hit her skin like a slap to the face.</p><p>She willed herself to calm down, for the ache that had taken up residence between her thighs to stop—but it took no notice. Her body had won out. </p><p><em> Fine. </em>She flipped the water to warm, sick of shivering away under the faucet for no reason other than her own stubbornness. If that wasn’t going to work, there was only one alternative: give in. </p><p>Agatha leaned against the tiles of the shower, bracing herself with one hand while she gripped the showerhead in the other, angling it between her legs. </p><p>The pressure didn’t build slowly like it usually did. The moment the stream of water made contact with her clit, a low moan rumbled in her throat.</p><p><em> Oh my god</em>, it had been so long since she’d done this—too fucking long. With Ralph, sex had been nothing more than a calendar item to tick off, and most of their infrequent interactions had ended with Agatha finishing herself off somewhere away from his prying eyes and dumb questions. </p><p>But since he’d left—since getting pregnant—she’d rarely been in the mood. Her vibrators were collecting dust in a drawer, batteries long dead. Nothing had been able to break through the constant cycle of rumination, the feeling of being trapped in her head and so distant from her body. </p><p>Until this. Until Rio. </p><p>She removed her other hand from the wall and parted herself with two fingers, moving the shower head around in slow circles. She needed more—more friction, more pressure, more everything.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she pictured Rio on her knees in front of her, hands gripping at her hips to steady them both as she lapped at her clit. Those hands—her long fingers, the callouses on her palms from tending to plants all day. And that tongue. The one that was always tucked into her cheek when she found something funny or had to hold herself back from making a sly comment. </p><p>In her fantasy, that tongue knew exactly how to make her come undone, flicking and sucking at all the right spots until Agatha came, screaming. </p><p>She wondered if sex with Rio would actually be like that, or if she was just building it up in her head.</p><p>“Rio,” she exhaled softly, tilting her head back. <em> Fuck</em>, she hoped the bathroom was as soundproof as it was purported to be back when she’d bought the place—Rio’s room was literally right next door. Still, she couldn’t help her name from spilling from her lips, not now that she’d crossed the mental threshold from friendship to desire.</p><p>The Rio in her mind looked up at her with a smirk, eyes dark under thick lashes. She removed one hand from Agatha’s waist and slipped two fingers easily inside her, pumping lazily while she circled her clit with that tongue like it was her goddamn job.</p><p>Desperate to feel full, Agatha pushed her own fingers through her wetness and curled them inside herself, dragging them against the perfect spot before thrusting them forward again—all the while imagining they were Rio’s. </p><p>When she came, repeating Rio’s name in her head like a mantra, it was intense enough to make her legs buckle underneath her. She quickly slid her fingers out of her pulsing cunt and gripped the wall for dear life again so she didn’t crumple onto the hard tiles. </p><p>“Fuck,” she exhaled, her heartbeat still pounding in her ears.</p><p>After a minute of trying to regain control of her breath, Agatha let her legs give way, sliding down the shower wall and onto the floor. The shower head clattered next to her, sending water in every direction before she reached up and gingerly hooked it over the taps. As the warmth began to spray over her, soaking her face and hair, she realised she was crying.</p><p>She touched the wetness on her face, tears and water practically indistinguishable. </p><p>It didn’t feel like despair. It didn’t feel like confusion, either. It just felt like release.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Calling your best friend after you’d just masturbated was weird—Agatha could admit it. But it didn’t stop her from firing off an emergency text within five minutes of getting out of the shower.</p><p>What she’d just done with Rio was out of character. Reckless. Possibly self-sabotaging.</p><p>But the aftermath had been really fucking hot… and oddly cathartic. She wouldn’t dispute that. Well, maybe in a court of law—but Wanda demanded the truth, and she needed someone to hold her accountable right now.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> SOS </em>🚨</p><p><b>Wanda: </b> <em> what’s going on!? </em></p><p>With the confirmation Wanda was awake and coherent enough to deal with some light emotional labour, Agatha dialled her number. She picked up on the second ring, and Agatha almost sagged with relief.</p><p>“I’m freaking out,” she whispered frantically, not bothering with the niceties Wanda was always prying out of her. There was no time for <em> hellos </em> when you were a second away from losing your shit.</p><p>“Calm your goddamn tits and tell me what’s happening, Harkness,” Wanda said impatiently. She could hear an egregious amount of background noise, probably coming from one of the boring therapist mixers that counted as fun at a national psychology conference. Her voice sounded a little off, less steady than usual—Agatha wondered if she was drunk. </p><p>“Hang on,” Wanda chastised. “It’s like one in the morning there. Why are you awake? And why are we whispering?” </p><p>Agatha drew in a deep breath. She needed to spit it out; to get it over and done with. “Because I just let Rio give me a fucking <em> massage </em>and, well—” she paused, running a hand over her face. Fuck, this was so embarrassing. “I think I'm figuring it out.”</p><p>The line was ominously quiet before sharp barks of laughter broke through in quick succession. </p><p>“Oh my god,” Wanda cackled. Oh, she was definitely drunk—or tipsy, at the very least. “You’re gay panicking,” she accused. </p><p>If Wanda was here in person, her finger would definitely be inches away from Agatha’s face, a self-satisfied grin on her lips. <em> Fucking know-it-all</em>. </p><p>“Is that what it is?” Agatha groaned, as quietly as she could. </p><p>“Yes, honey,” Wanda said. “I assumed you’d get there eventually, but I didn’t think it would be this soon.” She hesitated, like she was mulling it over. “Did anything else happen?” </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t too late to lie. Wanda wouldn’t be able to tell over the phone. </p><p><em> No </em>—she needed to be honest. “I had to… take care of it in the shower.” </p><p>The line went dead for a second, and Agatha looked down at her phone, confused, but the call was still running. “Wanda, did you put yourself on mute?” </p><p>Her best friend’s voice returned, wheezing with borderline-hysterical laughter. “Sorry, had to go outside,” she cackled. “I don’t need the entire APA hearing a play-by-play of your little solo sesh.” </p><p><em> Laugh it up, Red</em>, Agatha thought, running a towel over her damp hair while she death-gripped her phone between ear and shoulder. <em> I’m glad my misguided decisions are such a great source of entertainment for you. </em></p><p>“You’re about to lose your honesty privileges,” she warned, tossing the towel on her bedroom floor. </p><p>“Fine, I’m sorry,” Wanda apologised. “So you let your hot roommate touch you, and it turned you on, and then you got yourself off to the thought of her. Am I following okay?”</p><p>It sounded so salacious when you put it like that. Agatha felt more like a horny (and extremely confused) teenager than a grown woman right now. And she’d never really had a horny teenager phase—oh, <em> jesus fuck</em>, maybe she <em> was </em> gay. Not important. Well, probably important—but this was less about labels and more about Rio right now.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha gritted out. She pressed her fingers to her temples, rubbing slowly. “Task at hand, Maximoff. What do I do now?” </p><p>“I think we’re past the point where I can pull the strings for you, honey.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, instead exhaling a loud sigh directly into the receiver for Wanda to hear. God forbid her best friend help her in her time of need.</p><p>“Agatha, just—” Wanda cut herself off, irritation flaring. After a beat, she continued, softer this time. “Stop trying to out-think your feelings. Feel them.”</p><p><em> Feel her feelings. </em>Wasn’t that what she’d been doing? She was trying, and that had to count for something. </p><p>She took a deep breath and geared up to say what had been weighing on her mind since she’d emerged from the shower. The truth of it felt lodged in her throat. “It didn’t feel wrong like I thought it would.”</p><p>“How <em> did </em> it feel?”</p><p>“Hot,” Agatha admitted. “And… right. Inevitable.” </p><p>“Okay,” Wanda replied slowly. “So what’s stopping you, then?” </p><p>“I don’t know!” Agatha cried. She clamped a hand over her mouth, words a little too loud and her reaction a little too late. </p><p>She lowered her volume back down a few decibels, cheeks blazing. “I just want to be certain, you know? I– I don’t know what I’d do if I tried something and it didn’t turn out well.” </p><p>“You’re not gonna know until you give it a shot,” Wanda replied matter-of-factly. “Until you let go of the reins a little bit.”</p><p>“Wanda, I can’t hurt her,” Agatha breathed, the honesty flowing through her now. “I need her in my life.” </p><p>That was as big of an admission as any. She’d gone from holding Rio at arm’s length to not knowing what she’d do if she wasn’t there beside her, but another shift in proximity might prove impossible to navigate. </p><p>Rio was already embedded in her every day—hell, they lived together—but what would happen if she let her get even closer? It wasn’t like Agatha came without any baggage. She was pregnant, for fuck’s sake. </p><p>Being more than friends with Rio wouldn’t just mean opening herself up physically in a way she never had before. It would mean showing every side of her; the ugly parts, the self-doubt, all the traumatic stuff she’d stashed away. Some of it had already begun to bleed out between them, but there was more where that came from, waiting to be unravelled.</p><p>“Agatha, you need to tell her that,” Wanda said. “Talk to Rio, sooner rather than later. I don’t even want to imagine what she’s going through right now.”</p><p>The idea of Rio agonising over what this all meant made her sick to her stomach even more than her own shit. But Wanda was probably right again. </p><p>“I know,” Agatha acknowledged, inhaling sharply. “I will.”</p><p>After a reluctant <em> thank you </em>and a few minutes of chatting about what her best friend had been up to in California, Agatha hung up the phone, entirely spent. </p><p>Wanda’s advice was as sound as always. She was also going to take no notice of it—at least the part where she suggested she stop intellectualising her feelings. </p><p>She fought the urge to reach for a pen and paper to make a physical pros and cons list, instead just tallying things up on either side in her head as she laid in bed, a hand absent-mindedly drifting over her stomach. </p><p>
<em> Pro: She loved spending time with Rio. Con: All the feelings she had around her made her uncomfortable. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Pro: She knew she wanted to have sex with Rio now. Con: She’d never had sex with a woman before.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Con: She still had no clue how to define her sexuality. Pro: Everyone seemed to be telling her she didn’t have to.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Con: She’d been peddled the same ‘gay is bad’ narrative as half of America as a child. Pro: Her mother was in the ground, and no one else in her life cared. Hell, they were all fucking gay anyway.  </em>
</p><p>The mental math told her that both columns were equally stacked, no clear sign telling her which way to go. Maybe being rational was stupid, after all. It evidently wasn’t getting her anywhere. </p><p>But she didn’t know how to feel her feelings, not when they’d gotten so murky and complicated. Not now that there was so much at stake. </p><p>As she eventually settled into sleep, twisted up in the sheets, she tried to think good thoughts—the way she did when she was banishing a nightmare.</p><p>All she could come up with was <em> Rio, Rio, Rio</em>.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>If Agatha had met gay panic for the first time on Tuesday night, they were well on their way to becoming best friends by the week’s end.</p><p>On Wednesday, Rio had come home from work with dirt smudged across her cheekbone. Agatha had to sit on her hands to restrain herself from reaching over to wipe it off. It unsettled her, how quick her body was to react now that she’d unlocked this part of it. </p><p>The panic continued on Thursday. Usually, Agatha didn’t see Rio in her PJs—she always changed into basketball shorts or loungewear while they were sitting on the couch together. But that day was exceedingly hot, the mercury climbing to an uncomfortable 95 degrees that the apartment’s air conditioning did little to quell. </p><p>Rio had sauntered into the living room in nothing but a cropped muscle tee and a pair of black boxer briefs with a rainbow waistband, and it had made Agatha’s entire mouth go dry. She tried to avert her eyes from the swell of her ass in her tight underwear, the lithe muscle of her exposed abdomen—but it was no use. </p><p>She was down bad.</p><p>On Friday morning, the day of her amnio appointment, Agatha spent a little more time getting ready. She put on real clothes, a midi skirt and a t-shirt, and brushed her hair properly for the first time in days. It felt good, to put herself together like this—the only vestige of control she could cling to while everything else eddied around her like a goddamn whirlpool. </p><p>Once she was ready, Rio had met her in the living room with an easy smile, looking like the picture of summer—the same cut-off shorts she’d worn on their trip to the bookstore, her hair off her face in a flower clip. Man, she was so damn pretty. </p><p>They took the Q into Manhattan, and Agatha grew more and more anxious with each passing stop. Whether it was the impending appointment or the butterflies having a party in her gut every time she looked at Rio, she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Now, they were sitting in the waiting room together, Agatha’s hands clenched tightly at her sides while Rio scrolled on her phone. She’d tried to strike up conversation on the subway, but Agatha’s answers had been brief, although not unkind. </p><p>“Agatha Harkness?” the receptionist intoned dully, barely looking up from her computer screen. A nurse was standing off to the side of the desk, waiting to take her through to the procedure room.</p><p>“You ready?” Rio nudged her. </p><p>“Mmm-hmm,” Agatha nodded, closing her eyes to brace herself. She rose to her feet slowly and walked toward the consultation room, casting a quick glance behind her to make sure Rio was following. She was, and it put her at ease.</p><p>It wasn’t lost on Agatha, that while she and Rio were over 10 years apart in age, it was the younger woman supporting <em> her</em>—always steadying Agatha when her emotions tried to topple her, like a baby giraffe learning how to walk. </p><p>If it had been anyone else, it would’ve made her feel suffocated. Too reliant on another person. But the way that Rio was just <em> there </em> without question or comment strangely had the opposite effect.</p><p>“Mrs Harkness,” the nurse greeted her. It was a different woman to last time, shorter and older, her tone more abrupt. </p><p>“It’s Ms,” Agatha grunted. “And please, Agatha’s fine.”</p><p>“Agatha,” she confirmed, before pinning Rio with a curious look. “And you are?” </p><p>“Rio,” she introduced herself. She lifted her hand in an awkward wave, and it made Agatha smile.</p><p>“The doctor said I could have a… person,” Agatha said, tearing her attention away from Rio and back to the nurse. She felt the need to defend herself, to defend <em> them</em>. There was no way she was going in there without someone by her side.</p><p>“Of course,” the nurse replied. “I’ll leave you to get set up. Gown on, shoes and jewellery off, and just pull the blanket over you when you’re ready. The doctor will be in in a moment.” </p><p>Agatha set her bag down and fiddled with her necklace, unclasping it and dropping it onto a table while Rio stood looking around the room. “Uhh—” Agatha stammered, clutching the medical gown to her chest. Fuck, she was short-circuiting. “I need to change,” she gestured down at her clothes, hoping it was self-explanatory.</p><p>“I can close my eyes,” Rio chuckled, pulling a hand over her face. <em> Thank god</em>—she’d already been partially naked in front of her, and look where that had gotten her. She didn’t need to pile any more panic on top of what she was already feeling.</p><p>Agatha undressed quickly, shucking her clothes in the corner of the room, and threw on the gown. Once she’d settled on the procedure bed, blanket up over her hips, she spoke again: “All done.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes and shoved her hands into the pockets of her shorts. She looked a little nervous, like she wasn’t sure where she fit into the equation.</p><p>“Where do you want me?” Rio asked. </p><p>“You can just sit over there,” Agatha nodded towards the chair across the room. She faltered as she gave the instruction, but making Rio stand beside her and hold her hand would be too close for comfort right now. Right? </p><p>Before she could second-guess herself aloud, Dr Goldberg swept into the room, all bravado in a crisp white lab coat. “Agatha, how are you?”</p><p>“Fantastic,” she deadpanned. Rio shot her an amused look from over in her chair, their eyes finding one another instantly. <em> Quack</em>, she mouthed, and watched as Rio tried to stifle a laugh that quickly turned into a cough.</p><p>The doctor turned in Rio’s direction, like he was just noticing she was there.She lifted her eyebrows and offered him a tight smile. </p><p>“Rio,” she introduced herself for the second time, extending a hand for the doctor to shake. She didn’t stand up, and Agatha had to bite back a snort at how unimpressed she looked. Maybe they shared the same distaste for authority figures.</p><p>“Lovely to meet you,” Dr Goldberg replied. He walked back over to Agatha, rubbing his hands together. “Now, let’s get this show on the road.”</p><p><em> Ugh </em>—like it was nothing. Like it was a game. Like Agatha wasn’t anxious enough to barf all over his ugly shoes.</p><p>The nurse re-entered with a smile Agatha was sure was fake. “Quick ultrasound before the procedure,” she explained, unceremoniously lifting Agatha’s gown up and squeezing gel onto her belly. She flinched at its coldness—this nurse had no fucking bedside manner. Nothing on the last girl.</p><p>A grainy baby filled the screen again. It had been less than a week since her last ultrasound, but Agatha was comforted by the fact that it was still there. She’d received a notification that morning on the pregnancy app Wanda had told her to download: <em> Baby is the size of an avocado! </em></p><p>Her eyes darted to Rio to see what she was making of this. She looked pensive, like she was deep in thought about something. <em> Huh</em>—that was new. Usually Rio was the epitome of calm, never batting an eyelid at any of the baby-related stuff Agatha shared with her.</p><p>It made her wonder whether the other night had changed something for Rio, too. Maybe, like Agatha, she’d realised that their connection could become complicated if they let it—that there would always be a third person involved, even though they hadn’t actually been born yet.</p><p><em> Christ</em>, like this whole situation wasn’t already rife with reality TV-level drama. She shook her head to expel the thought and turned her focus back to the ultrasound. </p><p>“Baby seems happy,” the nurse said blithely, turning the screen away from Agatha and cleaning off her stomach.</p><p>After a few minutes only punctuated by the sounds of Dr Goldberg snapping on gloves and single-finger typing into the computer by the bed, he produced a long, thin needle that made Agatha’s heart race. “I’m going to insert this into your abdomen and draw out some of your amniotic fluid.”</p><p>“I don’t need reminding, thanks,” she snarled back. Did all doctors make it a point to terrify their patients with unnecessary information, or was it just hers that had no fucking filter to speak of?</p><p>While the nurse winced, clearly Goldberg was used to Agatha’s snarkiness by now, because he just went about his business. He swabbed a spot on her right side with an antibacterial wipe and cleared his throat. “Ready?” </p><p>Agatha gave a small nod, though she felt the furthest thing from ready. The sooner he jabbed her, the sooner this would be over.</p><p>She stared off into the distance, searching for something to focus on as the needle materialised in her peripheral vision. She could watch the clock on the wall; count down the seconds until this was all over. She could fixate on the art hanging there, some tacky, kitschy oil painting of babies in a cabbage patch.</p><p>But of course, Agatha’s eyes landed on Rio again. Sitting there, watching her, too respectful to overstep but too invested to look away. </p><p>This felt wrong.</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha choked out, the needle hovering inches from her belly. Thankfully, the doctor did as he was told, looking up at her patiently.</p><p>She couldn’t do this alone, not with Rio right there. She reached a hand out towards her and shot her a pleading look, not giving a second thought to what it might mean. </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, then softened. She was up off her chair in an instant, striding over to Agatha’s side. She took her hand gently, stroking a thumb along the backside. </p><p>“Hi,” Rio said quietly, brown eyes locked onto Agatha’s. </p><p>“Hi,” Agatha whispered back. The panic ebbed away.</p><p>The doctor glanced back and forth between them, waiting for a sign to continue. Eventually, Agatha nodded. </p><p>She didn’t look as the needle went in. Instead, she squeezed her eyes shut, concentrating on the feeling of her hand clasped tightly around Rio’s. Her nails were probably leaving a mark, scattering those weathered palms with tiny crescent moons. </p><p>She dug her fingers in harder as she felt the pressure of the needle, then relaxed when Rio’s other hand found her arm, rubbing it reassuringly. She could hear the distant sound of the doctor counting down, talking her through what he was doing, but her focus was tethered to the physical. The grounding feeling of skin-on-skin, holding her there so she didn’t float away. </p><p>“All done,” the doctor finally proclaimed. He didn’t seem fazed at all, considering he’d just poked at her stomach like he was trying to pop a balloon.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath as she opened her eyes. It was over. There were no sirens going off, she wasn’t bleeding out on the table, and the doctor looked so chill about it that she half-expected him to start whistling. </p><p>She looked up at Rio, then down at their conjoined hands, then back up at Rio. Her expression was warm and proud, the moment curling around them like a vine. Agatha didn’t want to let go of her hand—so she didn’t. </p><p>“You should have the results by Monday,” Dr Goldberg broke through their bubble. “In the meantime, take it easy. Tylenol if you experience any cramps, and no strenuous exercise or sex for a few days.”</p><p>Yeah, like that would be hard. Agatha’s gym membership had become nothing more than a charitable donation to Planet Fitness, and the only sex she was having was with herself.</p><p>“Your partner can take you home now,” he finished, smiling kindly at Rio.</p><p>Agatha caught the blush on Rio’s cheeks at his assumption, and felt the warmth creeping up her own to match. Still, neither of them said anything. </p><p align="center">———</p><p>Once they’d shuffled out of the appointment room, Agatha and Rio found themselves on the street in front of the doctor’s office, the searing heat hitting their skin in a welcome contrast to the chilly air conditioning inside.</p><p>“Coffee?” Rio asked, squinting up at the sun. “You haven’t had one yet.” </p><p>Agatha chuckled tightly, still pent-up with nerves. “What, you’re conspiring with my doctors now? Monitoring my caffeine intake?”</p><p>“Just observant,” Rio shrugged. She pointed at a cafe down the block. “Let’s go get you your daily dose of legal stimulants.”</p><p>The promise of a pick-me-up was, yet again, too good to pass up, so Agatha followed Rio the few paces down the street. She sat at a table outside while Rio ordered their coffees—not without first shoving a ten-dollar note in her hand to pay for them—looking out at the cars and people passing by while she waited.</p><p>After a few minutes, Rio emerged, Agatha’s cappuccino in one hand and a sweltering iced coffee in the other. “How are you feeling now?” she asked, lips wrapped around the straw. “Nerves calmed down?” </p><p>“Mmf,” Agatha replied. “Yes and no. Coffee’s probably not helping,” she admitted, although she immediately took another gulp. </p><p>“And yet, I don’t see you quitting any time soon,” Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Not happening,” Agatha snorted. “I don’t need another hard thing to deal with right now.”</p><p>“Hey, why don’t we go for a walk?” Rio asked suddenly. “Central Park’s literally right there, and I’m never in Manhattan.” </p><p>Even if the offer of a distraction was obvious, it was sweet—and Agatha wasn’t going to turn her nose up at it, or make an aside about how the native New Yorker never came to Central Park. “Sure,” she replied. </p><p>Clutching their to-go cups, they strolled through the city streets, past the New York Public Library and over into Central Park. The grey of skyscrapers and concrete slowly gave way to green: trees, grass, the lush meadows not yet crisp from the summer heat. </p><p>Rio inhaled deeply through her nose, face cast towards the sky. Agatha could’ve read that look from a mile away—peace. Calm. The feeling of finally being outside after an hour confined in a sterile procedure room. She knew because she felt it too. </p><p>They kept walking through the park, chatting about topic after topic—Agatha’s book. Rio’s week at work. What Jen and Alice were up to. The smarmy doctor and disinterested nurse at the OB/GYN office. Agatha sipped her drink slowly, collecting both her and Rio’s cups and taking them to the trash once they were done. </p><p>Finally, they passed by the red brick building that held the carousel. Agatha just cast a smile in its direction, listening to the squeals and giggles of kids as she continued her journey through the park. But she quickly realised Rio wasn’t with her, her familiar presence no longer lingering by her side.</p><p>She looked around and saw her standing stock-still in front of the carousel, back turned. Even from across the way, her posture looked different—rigid. </p><p>“Thought I lost you there,” Agatha said, sidling up to Rio with a careful smile. Rio didn’t glance in her direction, but Agatha got a glimpse of the look on her face: sadness. Fear. Longing.</p><p>“My mom used to take me here,” Rio breathed. Her gaze was fixated on the carousel, entranced by it as it circled round and round.</p><p>“Lilia?” Agatha asked curiously. Usually, when Rio spoke about Lilia, she used the term ‘foster mom’—a clear distinction between what was and what wasn’t. She’d never heard her just say <em> mom</em>. </p><p>“No, my biological mom,” Rio murmured. “Before she died.” Her voice was distant; not cold, but deeply coloured with something—grief, Agatha supposed. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she replied quietly. “I assumed as much, but… I’ve never heard you talk about her before.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her sneakers. A tendril of hair escaped from her clip, falling into her face. “I don’t.” </p><p>The words were simple, but they carried something heavy. It reminded her of their conversation over bagels a few weeks ago, when Agatha had pulled back before things got too deep. </p><p>This time, the need to console Rio was overwhelming. She spoke before she could even think about it, before she could analyse the implications of getting even closer—of tightening the string that ran between them. “Well, you can with me,” she said. “If you want to.” </p><p>Rio hummed in agreement, but it was half-hearted.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t felt like herself much lately, but this moment drove that home. The old Agatha—the one who built an impenetrable fortress to stop people from getting too close—would’ve just shrugged it off and moved the conversation along, probably by making an awkward joke. She definitely wouldn’t have offered to listen; to shoulder the weight of someone else’s burden. </p><p>She wasn’t that person anymore. It had happened over a matter of weeks, slowly but surely, but it felt shockingly sudden. Like she’d been jolted from a dream and had woken up changed, all because of Rio.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, putting a hand on Rio’s arm. Rio tilted her face up to look at her, and <em> shit</em>—the sight of her trying to blink back tears almost split Agatha’s heart clean in half. “I mean it. You’ve been there for me so much over these last few weeks,” she continued. “If you need me, I’m here for you too.” </p><p>Rio just nodded, but her smile was real, expression a little more open than it had been before. </p><p>Agatha drew in a deep breath, steeling herself to be vulnerable again. “Thank you for today,” she said. Her hand was still gently resting on Rio’s arm, next to a tattoo of a needle and thread. She’d noticed it a few times, wondering what it meant—maybe she’d get to find out, one day.</p><p>God, she was fucking stupid. She’d been waiting for an <em> a-ha </em> moment, for an anvil to fall on her head and leave her reeling. But maybe it didn’t have to feel like a big romantic realisation, and maybe she didn’t have to be <em> sure</em>. She was already doing the hard part—letting Rio in, opening herself up to her, offering to be there in the same way. </p><p>It could just be an accumulation of thoughts and moments that built into something undeniable.</p><p>It could just be this: coffees in Central Park, a conversation that felt like it would stretch on forever if she let it, and the warmth of Rio’s arm wrapped around hers. And a little bit of gay panic, thrown in for good measure.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio said simply. All traces of her sadness from seconds ago were gone, replaced by that untroubled smile Agatha knew so well. “Ready to keep walking?” </p><p><em> I would walk anywhere with you</em>, she thought. It popped into her head and settled there before she could fight it off, or recoil from it, or pick at it ‘til it was just bone. </p><p>And that’s how Agatha Harkness knew she was in trouble.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha started her Saturday with a renewed sense of purpose: she was going to talk to Rio. No, she <em> had </em>to, before she burst and spewed her feelings all over her after holding them in for too long.</p><p>The day prior had ended pleasantly, despite the mildly traumatic procedure. They’d walked around Central Park for over an hour, talking and observing and lapping up the sun. When Agatha had started to get tired, Rio called them a cab. They’d driven home in companionable silence, only interrupted by the occasional yawn and the sounds of Rio humming along to the radio. </p><p>Back at the apartment, Agatha had fallen into bed in that way you only could when tiredness had seeped beneath your skin and blurred the edges of your concentration. The nap had been deep and dreamless and a medal-worthy three hours long. </p><p>Later, she had wandered into the living room to find Rio sitting on the floor by the coffee table, a documentary about manatees on in the background while she did, of all things, a 1000-piece puzzle. The sight of her, focus sharp while she carefully turned over the pieces in her hands, was fucking adorable—Agatha’s heart had threatened to leap out of her chest.</p><p>But yesterday hadn’t felt like the right time to say something. She had been basking in the moment, content to sit with it a little while longer before having a conversation that might be hard, or awkward, or could change things forever. </p><p>So she’d just made them both a cup of tea and settled on the floor next to Rio, their crossed knees bumping together as she helped click the pieces into place.</p><p>The domesticity of it all wasn’t lost on her, but it wasn’t like anything had really changed, either. This is just how they were, now. Who they’d become to each other; how they slotted into each other’s lives. It gave her hope for the topic she was about to broach. </p><p>And today felt like the right day. She had slept well, even with the amnio anxiety curling around the edges of her thoughts. As she stretched in bed, the sunlight brightening her room, she felt positive… happy, even.</p><p>Since the night before, after they’d finished the puzzle (a scene of a dark, moody forest with way too many pieces that looked the same), Agatha had been rehearsing what she’d say to Rio. </p><p>The script in her head started light and upbeat: she’d tell her how much she enjoyed their time together, how grateful she was for all the support she’d offered. That part would come easily, after their moment in the park.</p><p>It was the next bit that made her uneasy, although she knew she had to push through it. The part where she confessed feeling something <em> more </em>to Rio; where she explained that somewhere along the way, through all the gentle conversations and gestures big and small, she’d parsed that their connection wasn’t just friendly. On either side. </p><p>It was more eager, more honest, than anything Agatha had ever said or done to anyone in her entire history of being. She wanted more than anything not to overthink it, and instead, to clutch tightly to the calm certainty that yesterday had instilled in her. </p><p>She kept circling back to one thing, as doubt bobbed in and out of her consciousness—they were good together, plain and simple. There was nothing standing in the way of telling Rio that, at least that she could see from her precarious position. </p><p>It wouldn’t be easy; her circumstances assured her of that. She was certain Rio hadn’t asked the universe to plop her in the lap of a pregnant woman over ten years her senior who’d barely given her sexuality a single thought until now. </p><p>But Agatha was also certain, down to her bones, that she wasn’t alone in this. The cups of tea, the quiet conversations, the way they made each other laugh so much their ribs hurt. How Rio steadied her as the world shifted beneath her feet—it all told her what she needed to hear.</p><p>So, it was time. Agatha landed on talking to her later that day, when she got home from work. </p><p>She didn’t know what she’d find when she cracked Pandora’s box, but she had to trust that whatever Rio felt, it wouldn’t shatter the fragile thing blooming between them.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>When Rio opened the front door to their apartment that afternoon, Agatha was practically vibrating with anticipation. She did her best to not corner her the second she entered, instead lolling on the couch, pretending to work.</p><p>She waited while Rio puttered around in the kitchen, washing up her food containers and grabbing things out of the fridge. Each second that ticked by made her more anxious, breath catching in her throat as she ran over the notes she’d prepared in her head.</p><p>Finally, Rio entered the room and gave her a bright smile. “Hey!”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said carefully, returning her smile. It didn’t reach all the way to her eyes—the nerves made sure of that. She inhaled a deep, steadying breath. “Can we talk?” </p><p>Rio glanced at her watch before looking back up with an earnest expression. “Of course,” she replied. “What’s it about?”</p><p>
<em> Oh, nothing. Just the fact that I’m insanely attracted to you, want to spend every waking minute with you, and hope you feel the same way. Also, I’m scared shitless about telling you, because I don’t know what I’ll do if this breaks down. Simple stuff, really. </em>
</p><p>“Umm, nothing too crazy,” Agatha lied. “But it might take a while.” </p><p>Rio grimaced apologetically. “Sorry, Jen and Alice are like twenty minutes away, and I still need to get ready,” she gestured down at her rumpled work uniform. “Later?”</p><p>It wasn’t a rejection, but it wasn’t what she’d hoped for, either. “Oh, sure,” Agatha agreed, trying to temper her disappointment. She didn’t want to put this off any longer, but she supposed she had no choice—she needed Rio to be a present and willing participant in the conversation. “Going out?” </p><p>“Yeah, although I have no idea where they’re taking me,” Rio shrugged. “Alice texted about needing a night out, and I couldn’t really say no.” </p><p>It made her chuckle—Rio was a good friend. “Fair enough. When you get home, then. I’ll probably still be up,” she said, patting her stomach.</p><p>“Cool,” Rio agreed, before excusing herself to her room.</p><p><em> Well, that was a lot of fucking worry for nothing, </em> Agatha thought. Rationally, she wanted to talk to Rio at a good time for both of them, because surely that would affect the outcome—there was no use in rushing it. But she could still feel the suspense buzzing in her body, all the way from her feet to her fingertips. She sighed and flopped backwards on the couch, closing her eyes. </p><p>Thirty minutes later, there was a knock at the door. </p><p>“Harkness!” Jen called out as she strode into the apartment uninvited, heels click-clacking against the hardwoods. Seconds later, she appeared in Agatha’s view, a striking figure clad in an abundance of pink—because when was she not? Her glittery halter top and tight mini skirt made her look like the Black version of Paris Hilton. Annoyingly, it worked. </p><p>“Long time no see,” she greeted, rounding the couch to peer at Agatha’s laptop, sitting open on the coffee table. “How’s that novel cooking?”</p><p>“It’s… simmering.” A bold-faced lie—she’d barely worked on it over the last few weeks, too wrapped up in her own shit to give her characters the attention they deserved. </p><p>They could wait a little longer, Agatha supposed. They’d already had to push her publication date back because of the pregnancy knocking her on her ass, and now all these <em> feelings </em> were doing the same. Still, she was cautiously optimistic—about her book’s progress, sure, but more importantly, about Rio.</p><p>Good things took time.</p><p>“And the kid?” Jen asked, gaze drifting to Agatha’s stomach, a sliver of roundness peeking out from between her t-shirt and sweat shorts.</p><p>She looked down at the hand splayed across her belly, drumming her fingers there fondly. “Much better than the book.”</p><p>Agatha hoped it was true—she still had at least a day to kill before the doctor’s office would call with her amnio results. But while the waiting was proving difficult, it had nothing on what was building inside her now, the swirling doubt of words unspoken.</p><p>“Alice coming in?” she asked, looking back over at Jen. Her agent was perched primly on the armchair across from her now, no space to join Agatha on the couch.</p><p>“Yeah, she’s just having a smoke out front,” Jen nodded. “She’ll be up in a sec.”</p><p>“Where are you guys headed?”</p><p>“To the holy land,” she said sagely, wiggling her eyebrows. “AKA, the better of New York’s two remaining lesbian bars.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. <em> Of course they were.</em> “And what inspired this little pilgrimage?”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “It’s Saturday,” she said, like that was reason enough. Ugh—Agatha recalled a time where her Saturday nights were spent at bars and clubs, rather than stretched out on her couch in sweats, drinking sparkling juice just to feel something. “And Rio could use a fun night,” Jen continued.</p><p><em> Ouch</em>. </p><p>“What, staying in with me and watching shitty horror movies over takeout isn’t fun? Jennifer, you wound me,” Agatha said, flinging a hand across her forehead dramatically.</p><p>A strange expression flashed across Jen’s face, but before she could question it, Alice appeared at the open front door of the apartment. She too was dressed up—or at least, in what Agatha guessed was her own Alice way. Black pants, heeled boots, and an effortlessly cool bomber jacket to rival Tom Cruise in <em> Top Gun</em>.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” she waved, walking tentatively into the living room. “How are you?” </p><p>Agatha realised she hadn’t seen Alice since they’d all had dinner together, and while she’d patched things up with Jen, she wasn’t sure how Alice felt about her. She offered a warm smile in her direction, hoping it would put her at ease. “I’m good, Alice. You?” </p><p>“Can’t complain,” she replied, coming up behind Jen in the armchair and resting a gentle hand on her shoulder. Jen looked back at her and grinned. They were sweet together, it was true—Jen’s sharp edges buffed away by Alice’s solidity and calm.</p><p>Could she and Rio be together like this, if they let it? Would things still be easy like they were now, or would the complicated nature of Agatha’s life get in the way? She didn’t know—yet another thing to add to the mystery tally—but she was determined to find out.</p><p>“Rio almost ready?” Alice asked. </p><p>“Uh, she was just getting dressed, I think.”</p><p>“I’m coming,” Rio called from her bedroom, voice echoing through the apartment at the sound of her own name. Seconds later, she strolled out, head down as she rustled through her bag.</p><p><em> Oh</em>, and if this was what it felt like when your heart stopped, Agatha just prayed no one would perform CPR. Rio was wearing a tight black bandeau top, paired with tailored, high-waisted black shorts that exposed miles of tanned leg. She tried to stop herself from gaping at the firm expanse of middle that was on display thanks to the mere scrap of fabric covering Rio’s chest. </p><p>Whoever this was, she was a far cry from the Rio Agatha was used to—the one that lived in baggy basketball shorts and had an impressively large collection of tank tops. Her hair curled loose around her shoulders, and she was wearing an uncharacteristic amount of makeup, brown eyes rimmed with black and cherry red painting her lips.</p><p><em> Jesus fucking Christ</em>, Agatha had never thought about ravishing someone before in her life… but she was beginning to see the appeal.</p><p>“Fuck, you look hot,” Jen nodded approvingly, echoing Agatha’s inner monologue. “Doesn’t she look hot, baby?” she asked, turning to Alice.</p><p>Alice wrinkled her nose. “Ew, that’s like asking me if I think my brother is hot,” she said, before relenting: “But yeah, she cleans up damn good.” </p><p><em> Hot? Cleans up good? </em> Understatements of the year. Rio was a fucking <em> revelation</em>, and just looking at her stirred that now all-too-familiar sensation low in Agatha’s belly. She couldn’t even be bothered to fight it now—the attraction had grown legs of its own.</p><p>“Thanks, guys,” Rio said. She rolled her eyes to deflect the attention, but there was a pleased smirk on her lips. Agatha blinked as Rio’s gaze flicked towards her, just a split-second glance that no one else in the room seemed to notice. Was this for her? Or was there someone else out there—a faceless woman waiting at the bar, ready to be charmed by Rio in the very same way?</p><p>“Everyone ready to go?” Alice asked, grabbing Jen’s hand and pulling her up from the armchair. Rio and Jen both nodded. </p><p>“Have fun,” Agatha raised her hand in a half-hearted wave. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”</p><p>“That would rule out a lot,” Jen retorted sarcastically. Rio chuckled under her breath at the joke, but not before tilting her head in Agatha’s direction again and giving her a short, sharp wink.</p><p><em> Oh, no</em>—her insides were on fire again. She bit her lip, trying to stop the blush from rising to her cheeks. They needed to talk, <em> soon </em>, even if it was just so this didn’t keep happening. </p><p>She watched as the three friends traipsed out of the apartment, talking and laughing. The door shut behind them, and everything fell quiet again. Agatha stared at the space where Rio had been standing, her skin still tingling with the memory of that wink.</p><p>Clearly, she’d waited too long to talk to her. Because now, thanks to her own uncertainty, she had to wait some more—all while Rio was out at a bar, her actions completely out of her control <em> and </em> sight.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After nuking a plate of leftover empanadas and microwave veggies for dinner, Agatha sat back on the couch, the thoughts coming thick and fast. She turned each one over in her head with the precision of a surgeon.</p><p><em> Rio could use a fun night</em>. Had she said something to Jen and Alice? Was she sick of spending all of her precious downtime with her pregnant, emotional roommate? Although it hurt, Agatha couldn’t exactly blame her. Their dynamic had gotten… intense.</p><p>It hinted at something darker and more serious, though—at least in Agatha’s mind. Was this night out a setup? A chance to find someone else, someone less complicated? </p><p>And then there was the wink—she couldn’t even begin to dissect that one in the context of the evening. Yeah, yeah, Rio had winked at her before. Maybe it was nothing. </p><p>Maybe it was <em> all </em>nothing. Maybe she was just making it up in her head, and the conversation she still planned on having with Rio eventually would go the way she wanted it to. </p><p>Or maybe it would send everything up in flames. </p><p>Jesus Christ, she was spiralling again. A common occurrence, though certainly not a welcome one.</p><p>Her fingers itched, eyes darting over to her phone. She could text Rio, see how her night was going. It wouldn’t be weird—they were friends, and friends checked in with one another. </p><p>But normal, non-neurotic adults probably didn’t do that. No, what she needed was a good old-fashioned distraction… and while it <em> literally </em> had Rio written all over it, she had just the thing. </p><p>Agatha walked over to her bedroom and extracted the first draft of Rio’s college essay from the mess of her dresser drawers. The pages were lined and worn, still showing signs of the ball Rio had crumpled them into on the night they’d talked on the balcony. She’d smoothed them back out before handing it to Agatha with a rueful smile: <em> go easy on me</em>, she’d joked.</p><p>The next week, Rio had emailed her second attempt over with <em> Not urgent </em> written in the subject line. She’d reassured her again in person that there was no rush for Agatha to look over it, and that she’d be doing her a huge favour—always endearing with her earnestness and freely given thank yous.</p><p>Settling back on the couch, Agatha flipped through the first draft, red-penned notes swallowing the page. Some of the comments were right—the original draft was verbose, the points struggling to emerge in a few sections. But Agatha could see Rio’s heart in it; in the way she emphatically tried to make her case. </p><p>She cared so much. About her job, about school, about <em> Agatha</em>. About Agatha’s unborn child, whom she owed absolutely nothing. Surely that care couldn’t just vanish in an instant. </p><p>Once she’d gotten the gist of the first essay, Agatha pulled her laptop onto her knees to read the latest version. This one was <em> good</em>—really good. She’d taken a different tack, structuring the argument methodically, and it made it much more impactful.</p><p>Just her luck. Not only was Rio hot, funny, and attuned to her every need, but she was smart, too. Another reason that everyone in New York’s best lesbian bar was probably fawning over her right now, telling her how fucking gorgeous she looked in that crop top.</p><p>Agatha zeroed back in on the essay, tearing her focus away from what Rio may or may not be doing. She started from the top, adding comments where she could expand or refine, but they were far and few between—Rio had nailed it. She couldn’t wait to hear what her advisor thought of it when she read it; what grade she’d get when all was said and done.</p><p>She wrote her last comment, leaving a little smiley face and a <em> this is fantastic!! </em>in the margins of the document. Finished, the cursor blinked at her inanely. Now that Rio’s paper was out of the way, she had no excuse not to work on her novel, but she wasn’t in the mood—it wasn’t enough to keep her from her thoughts. </p><p>Not while she was weighed down by this, what would you call it… jealousy? Longing? No—she didn’t get jealous, didn’t yearn for people like a lovesick teenager in a YA novel. </p><p><em> Pfft</em>. A lie. She hadn’t done a lot of things, but then she’d met Rio.</p><p>Agatha scrambled for another distraction. She’d already dumped enough on Wanda these last few weeks, and she didn’t want to <em> talk about it </em>—she just needed an escape until Rio got home. So, she dialled the number of the only other person who could possibly make her feel better.</p><p>“Aunt Agatha?” Billy answered, his voice raspy and tired. <em> Was he sleeping? </em> She glanced at her watch—he couldn’t be. It was barely 10pm on a weekend in the middle of summer. </p><p>“Hey, kid,” Agatha said. “Just checking in to see how you’re going.” </p><p>“Well, I was good, until you woke me up,” he grumbled. Jesus, teenagers today—they were way too fucking soft.</p><p>“It’s Saturday night,” she chastised. “Why aren’t you out with the other teenagers being a menace to society?”</p><p>Billy groaned, the sound muffled. “I have work at 6am.” </p><p>Agatha pictured him with his face buried in the pillow, curly hair mussed from sleep, and laughed to herself. He’d always been such an angelic sleeper, ever since he was a little kid—a stark contrast from Tommy, who’d gone from keeping Wanda up all night as a toddler to crashing out like the dead, mouth open and snoring, as a teenager.</p><p>She wondered which camp her own kid would be in. She hoped it was Billy’s, although if her pregnancy insomnia was anything to go by, the latter seemed more likely. </p><p>“You got a job?” Agatha asked curiously. Wanda hadn’t mentioned it to her, but they hadn’t been texting as much while she was away. </p><p>“Mm-hmm,” Billy confirmed proudly. “At the cafe in town.”</p><p>“Makes total sense,” she snorted. “You have barista energy. Probably took one look at that eyebrow slit and hired you on the spot.”</p><p>Billy let out a disgruntled gasp, but there was a hint of laughter in there. “That’s homophobic.”</p><p>She chuckled, stretching her legs out in front of her. “Okay, well I won’t keep you from your exciting plans, then.”</p><p>“No, no,” Billy protested. “What are you up to?” </p><p>Agatha looked down at the scene in front of her, a cup of tea resting precariously on the arm of the couch and the stapled pages of an essay about pedagogy on her chest.</p><p>“I was just sitting on the couch reading one of Rio’s college papers. Extremely interesting stuff,” she said dryly, although a smile threatened her lips. Who was she kidding—while the subject matter was relatively boring, the insight into Rio’s mind fascinated her. Agatha would read another ten college papers if it meant getting to see more below the surface.</p><p>“Rio, huh?” Billy replied slyly. <em> Jesus</em>—the mention of her name seemed to have woken him right up. “You tell her you like her yet?” he asked casually. </p><p>Like he hadn’t just dropped a bomb in her lap, or anything. </p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth a few times, astonished by the fucking <em> gall </em>of her best friend. Sure, Wanda didn’t have a sparkling reputation as a secret-keeper, but she’d assumed she’d at least zip her big mouth shut until Agatha had the chance to talk to Rio. </p><p>“I am going to murder your mother,” she huffed. “You’d think a therapist would understand doctor-patient confidentiality.” Not that she was actually her shrink—her unofficial one, maybe. She probably needed to start paying a real therapist, but that was its own fucking can of worms. A different thread for another day.</p><p>Billy hummed knowingly down the line, as if Agatha had just given him all the confirmation he needed. “She didn’t say anything to me,” he said lightly, “but she didn’t have to.” </p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha sighed, tilting her head back. Too smart for his own good. Now she couldn’t even deny it—Billy had led her right into his trap. “What tipped you off?” </p><p>He was quiet for a second as he thought it over. “I’ve just never seen you look at someone like that,” he finally said. “Or laugh that much. Even at me.”</p><p>Those words were familiar. It clicked in her brain immediately—it was exactly what Wanda had said to her, but not about her own feelings. About Rio’s. </p><p>“God, you really are your mother’s son,” she muttered, trying to joke her way out of it.</p><p>“She definitely likes you, too,” Billy pressed. “You should tell her.”</p><p>Well, that had been the plan—that is, until Jen and Alice had strongarmed the object of her affection out of the safety of their apartment and into what she could only picture was a crowd of hot, queer, not-pregnant women.</p><p>Now the possibility of being with Rio felt like it was rapidly slipping out of her reach, before she’d even had the guts to grab onto it. And what if it did? What if Rio moved on, and Agatha had to live in this apartment watching it happen, day after day?</p><p>“Yeah,” she agreed softly. “I was starting to think that, but…” She drew in a breath like it pained her. “I’m wondering if I’ve left it too late.”</p><p>She could practically <em> hear </em> the frown on Billy’s face. “What makes you think that?”</p><p>“She’s out at a bar tonight, with her friends,” Agatha shrugged. “I’m sure she’s got a line of lesbians out the door for her.”</p><p>“Oh, no,” he brushed her off. “That girl wants <em> you</em>. That doesn’t just go away overnight.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure. Maybe it hadn’t <em> happened </em> overnight—maybe Rio was sick of waiting around for a self-proclaimed straight woman who’d taken way too long to figure out her own feelings. </p><p>It was poetic, in a sick kind of way—that once Agatha was finally ready, Rio could possibly be retreating without hazarding a glance in her rear-view mirror. Ships in the night, or something like that.</p><p>But Billy didn’t seem to agree. “Trust me,” he emphasised, with all the confidence of a seasoned relationship expert. “I’ve been losing my shit over Eddie for like a year.”</p><p>(Yeah, and look how <em> that </em> was playing out. Those two had been circling each other for way too long, and it was starting to get irritating—although, Agatha realised she couldn’t talk; not now.)</p><p>“Well, maybe you should take your own advice and tell your little crush you like him,” Agatha teased, thankful for the change in topic.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Billy said indignantly, like the mere thought outraged him. She hoped he hadn’t picked up some of her emotional unavailability over the years. While they weren’t genetically related, nurture was often just as strong as nature.</p><p>Agatha checked the time on her phone—they’d only been talking for a few minutes, but she didn’t want to keep Billy up too late. The kid needed his beauty sleep, and at least a couple of brain cells to make people’s long-winded coffee hours before the sun had fully risen. “You should really be getting to bed,” she said. “Come to the city for a visit when your mom’s back.”</p><p>That perked him up almost as much as talking about Rio had. “Can we go see <em> Hadestown</em>?” he asked excitedly.</p><p>This adorable little teen and his gay little interests. She loved him so much, even if the idea of sitting through a two-hour-long Broadway show about Greek mythology made her want to take a spoon to her eyeballs. She’d do it for him… the musical, not the eyeball gouging.</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha agreed easily. “Tell me when and I’ll buy the tickets.”</p><p>“You’re the best.” </p><p>“Goodnight, Billy. Oh, and tell your brother I say hey,” she added off-handedly.</p><p>“Tell him yourself, you have his number,” Billy muttered, before his tone became soft and sweet again. “Night, Aunt Agatha,” he said, before hanging up the phone. </p><p>By midnight, after lots of flipping through TV channels and Googling random things, Agatha had begun to realise that Rio probably wasn’t coming home—at least, while she was still awake. The thought was eating away at her insides, like there were two batteries trying to attract one another somewhere within the lining of her gut, leaking acid along the way. </p><p>If this had happened before she was pregnant, she would’ve had a foolproof feelings exit plan. Two glasses of whisky, a smoke on the balcony, and half a sleeping pill. Thirty minutes, tops, and she’d be fast asleep in her bed with a blissfully numb brain. </p><p>But she <em> was </em> pregnant, and there were no vices available to her, as high and low as she’d searched for them. Maybe that’s why the last few weeks had brought such a goddamn onslaught of feelings—she didn’t have any other choice but to face them, to try to process them. </p><p><em> Feel your feelings, Agatha, </em>Wanda’s voice rang self-righteously in her ears. </p><p>Well, right now she was feeling… strange. Itchy. Un-fucking-well. And ready to sleep this shit off.</p><p>She hauled herself to her feet, limbs sore from a good half a day spent lying on the couch. <em> Tomorrow</em>, she thought, walking towards her bedroom, where she’d undoubtedly toss and turn for at least a few hours. <em> I’ll do it tomorrow</em>. </p><p align="center">———</p><p>A new day dawned, as it always did. Agatha woke earlier than she’d hoped to, but spent the morning stewing in bed, running over her plan to talk to Rio just like the day before. </p><p>The script had changed, though—it was more tentative, less sure. Coloured by the idea that Rio might not want her anymore, especially if she’d found someone else to occupy her attention last night.</p><p>She wandered into the living room, wondering if she’d find it empty or not. Her question was answered within a few short seconds: Rio was sitting on the couch, all traces of yesterday’s glam gone and replaced with a bare face and an oversized t-shirt. She looked tired, but unerringly beautiful—maybe even more beautiful than she did with a face full of makeup and fancy clothes.</p><p>Agatha’s instincts told her to breeze past Rio and make a coffee in the kitchen to give herself a little more time. Though her feelings were still true, last night had muddied them—and she didn’t trust herself not to lead with jealousy or defensiveness.</p><p>Rio caught her before she could tiptoe quietly past. “Good morning,” she mumbled, sounding a little sleepy. Still, she wore a warm smile. </p><p>“Morning,” Agatha hummed. She took a seat across from Rio, sitting awkwardly on the armchair. Were they about to do this now? While Rio was potentially hungover and Agatha was definitely still mid-spiral? That sounded… inadvisable. </p><p>“Didn’t hear you get home last night,” Agatha said casually, trying not to let her complex emotions permeate her voice. It was fine—Rio was her own person, and she didn’t owe Agatha anything. They’d talk, Agatha would listen to what she had to say, and if that meant facing rejection… well, she’d cross that bridge when she came to it. </p><p>Rio grimaced. “I didn’t,” she admitted, and it sank to the bottom of Agatha’s stomach with all the weight of a boulder. “I passed out on Alice’s couch at like, 3am.” </p><p>Okay, that was kind of reassuring. At least she hadn’t stayed over at some woman’s house, though Agatha supposed something still could’ve happened. There were always club bathrooms, and the back of cabs, and dingy alleyways to consider—all viable places for a quick fuck when you were in your early 30s. </p><p>But that didn’t sound very Rio. Agatha berated herself for thinking otherwise—she knew this woman. She knew her heart, and it was so fucking full of goodness it made her want to cry. There was a ninety-nine-percent chance that even if she poured her heart out to Rio and she didn’t feel the same way, she’d handle it with grace and kindness. </p><p>“What was it that you wanted to talk about yesterday?” Rio asked suddenly. She crossed a leg underneath her on the couch, readying herself for the conversation. </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Agatha stammered. She ran a hand through her hair nervously. <em> Shit </em>, this was it. The moment where she threw everything into the void on a prayer and hoped it panned out the way she wanted it to.</p><p>Before she could open her mouth, though, her phone began buzzing wildly on the coffee table. She frowned, reaching over to grab it, and clocked the caller ID: <em> Westside Family Medical. </em> Her OB/GYN’s office.</p><p>Her panic arced, shifting from Rio to <em> what the fuck </em> and <em> why now</em>. They were meant to call on Monday. It was Sunday morning. Did that mean something was wrong? Doctor’s offices rarely called on the weekends unless it was important… didn’t they?</p><p>She looked down at the ringing phone, then back up at Rio. “It’s my OB’s office,” Agatha said shakily, holding it up like it might explode. </p><p>Concern flashed in Rio’s eyes, the energy in the room turning swift and urgent. “Answer it,” she said. “I’ll be right here.” </p><p>Agatha nodded. She stood up abruptly from the couch and walked to the other side of the room. This felt like the kind of conversation that warranted pacing back and forth, and her feet seemed to get the memo just as her brain did.</p><p>“Hello?” </p><p>“Mrs Harkness?” It was the nurse from Friday, the grumpy one who couldn’t get a simple honorific right. She didn’t correct her this time. </p><p>“Speaking,” she replied. Her voice trembled as the hand she was gripping the phone in trembled, too.</p><p>“I’m just calling to let you know we’ve received the results of your amniocentesis,” the nurse droned. <em> Fucking hurry up</em>, Agatha thought, the panic rising in her chest, heart thumping a million miles a minute as she strode across the room, back turned to Rio. <em> Just tell me</em>. </p><p>“We didn’t identify any genetic abnormalities or issues with the pregnancy.” Agatha’s feet stopped of their own accord as the nurse continued. “Everything looks to be perfectly fine.”</p><p>All the air left her lungs.</p><p><em> Perfectly fine</em>. Nothing to worry about. An anticlimactic ending to days and days of all-consuming fear. Agatha felt like she was going to throw up—perhaps that was the only way to purge herself of all this build-up, the tension that had tucked itself away underneath her ribcage that was now trying to escape by any means necessary.</p><p>Somehow, though, she wasn’t sick all over her living room. In a voice that didn’t feel like her own, she quietly thanked the nurse. </p><p>“We’ll see you in a few weeks for your next scan,” the nurse finished, her tone a little kinder than before. “Enjoy the rest of your weekend.”</p><p>“You too,” Agatha echoed, ending the call. She turned around slowly, trying to control the rhythm of her breath, and saw Rio standing up off the couch. Her hands fidgeted at her sides.</p><p>“What did they say?” she asked, taking a careful step forward.</p><p>Agatha just blinked at her for a minute, processing the news. She saw the worry edging Rio’s features, her eyes wide and lips parted softly, as if she was trying her best just to breathe, too.</p><p>“Everything’s okay,” she finally managed, but the words were distorted by the sob that escaped from her throat. Tears instantly crowded her vision and her knees went weak, buckling beneath her as the room began to tilt. She braced herself for impact, to fall on the floor in a crumpled heap, a worn-out shell of a human being unable to keep herself upright as the relief consumed her entire body. </p><p>But there was no cold, hard crack of joints on hardwood—because suddenly Rio was buoying her up, like a life preserver in a storm. Like it was easy, like it made sense, like she’d been there all along.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio whispered, her voice so close that it vibrated against the shell of Agatha’s ear. “Everything’s okay,” she said soothingly. </p><p>She kept repeating it while Agatha simply dissolved into her hold: <em> you’re okay, everything’s okay</em>. They stayed like that as Agatha cried, for minutes that easily could’ve been hours.</p><p>As the sobs wracking her body slowed, giving way to calm, she became more aware of the press of their bodies against one another—Rio’s arms wrapped tightly around her waist, her own grasping at strong shoulders. One of Rio’s hands was rubbing gentle circles against the small of her back, providing even more comfort than her words. </p><p>Maybe they didn’t need to talk about it first. This right here was a safety she’d never felt before; not with Ralph, certainly not with her mother, and not even with Wanda, although it came close. And she’d already interrogated the fuck out of it, had come to the conclusion that she wanted it—that she <em> needed </em>it, like air or water or food.</p><p>Her face was tucked into the crook of Rio’s neck, leaking tears all over her yet again. She pulled back, sniffling, and caught a flash of brown eyes watching her with concern. </p><p>Rio fished a tissue out of her pocket. “Here you go,” she said gently, dabbing at Agatha’s eyes with the thin paper. The warmth of one hand was still pressing against her waist, and their faces were so close their noses were almost touching.</p><p>If the last few weeks had been a lesson in listening to her body rather than her mind, this was the final test. It blazed in every fucking inch of her: certainty.</p><p>Her gaze locked onto Rio’s, and this time, she didn’t look away. Instead, she reached up and touched Rio’s face, ghosting her fingers along the sharp line of her jaw, the fullness of her cheek. Anchoring herself there, she closed the gap, pulling Rio down into a slow, tentative kiss.</p><p>It was careful at first, like they were standing on the edge of something they couldn’t return from. But then Rio kissed her back, and everything inside her lit up, and the fear was just… gone. Replaced by something so much better—hope, desire, and <em> freedom</em>. </p><p>The fireworks metaphor was overdone. Agatha would never dare to use it in one of her books. But in her own life, it felt pretty apt.</p><p>
<em> Boom.</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It didn’t take long for the fireworks to turn into missiles.</p><p>Not for the reason the Agatha from a few weeks ago would’ve guessed—not because she was kissing her much-younger, extremely female roommate.</p><p>But because she’d ignored the plan, and run the risk of turning the sweet thing between them into something trivial before she could tell Rio how much it actually meant.</p><p>She’d convinced herself she was right, but in taking the reins, she’d done Rio a disservice, not giving her a chance to say her piece or play a role in what happened next.</p><p>So she savoured the feeling of Rio’s lips on hers for one final second before pulling away, praying to a god she definitely didn’t believe in that this wouldn’t fuck everything up and they’d get to do it again soon. Like, the next five minutes kinda soon.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha exhaled, extracting her arms from where they’d been slung around Rio’s neck and dropping them by her sides. Rio’s hands were still hooked around her waist, but she got the memo and awkwardly followed suit. </p><p>“I shouldn’t have done that… like that.” She smiled tightly up at Rio, hoping it conveyed what she was feeling. Not <em> stop </em> or <em> I don’t want this</em>, just <em> let’s slow down.</em> </p><p>But Rio’s expression had already turned resigned. Sad, but like she’d expected it. And <em> fuck</em>, this wasn’t how this was supposed to go.</p><p>Rio drew in a sharp breath through her nose, like she was bracing for impact, filling her lungs so she didn’t deflate. “You— you don’t have to apologise,” she replied slowly, shaking her head. She was quiet for a moment, and Agatha watched as she rubbed her thumb along one finger, back and forth. Her anxious tell.</p><p>“It was an emotional moment, I get it,” Rio said. Her voice was steady, but perhaps for the first time since Agatha had known her, there was something harder in it. “We can just forget about it.”</p><p><em> No, no, Jesus no. </em>Fuck, she needed to fix this right now.</p><p>Because letting Rio slip away before she’d even had the chance to hold her would’ve been hard.</p><p>But watching her leave <em> now</em>, after they’d kissed and Agatha had felt every cell in her body light up like a goddamn glowstick? That might just be a pain she’d never come back from.</p><p>Her hand shot out and grabbed Rio’s wrist before she could turn away. “No, Rio—” she stumbled. Something different flashed in those brown eyes, then—confusion, but tinged with hope.</p><p>She looked down at Rio’s hand, the way her fingers twitched like she desperately wanted to grab onto Agatha’s but didn’t know if she should yet. </p><p>“That’s just not how I pictured that happening,” she finally said. </p><p>It was true—kissing Rio today hadn’t even been on her radar; not really. She’d been hell-bent on talking to her first, but the heat of the moment had won out. Their bodies had fit together so perfectly, so safely, like the pieces of the dumb puzzle that still decorated their coffee table, and she hadn’t been able to stop herself from leaning in.</p><p>From her vantage point, it didn’t change anything. She’d <em> wanted </em>to kiss Rio. But Rio didn’t know that. She probably assumed it had been a byproduct of all the emotion swirling between them, relief driving them into each other’s arms.</p><p>So hopefully her words would put her at ease. </p><p>She looked at Rio again, watching as a hesitant expression came over her face. “You pictured it?” Rio asked. Her voice shook a little, like she didn’t believe it—like she was leaving room for Agatha to take it back.</p><p>There was no way she was taking it back. She took a breath and summoned all of her confidence, before removing her hand from Rio’s wrist and intertwining their fingers gently. Rio looked down at them in wonder as Agatha continued: “I absolutely did.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, long and slow, the life returning to her eyes. <em> Oh, thank god. </em> “Wow,” she chuckled. “And here I was, thinking I’d be pining over you forever.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled. “You’ve been <em> pining</em>?”</p><p>Sure, she’d guessed that Rio liked her. Everyone had told her Rio liked her, like this was high school or some shit. But pining was kind of a surprise.</p><p>Rio’s lips twisted into a sheepish smile. “Just a little bit,” she said, holding up a thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m so fucking oblivious sometimes,” Agatha sighed, pressing the hand that wasn’t linked with Rio’s to her face. She peeked out at her from the cracks between her fingers. “Although, I knew. Or at least, I was pretty certain.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. “Wouldn’t take a private investigator to figure out.” </p><p>“Why didn’t you say something?”</p><p>Before she responded, Rio gave Agatha’s hand a tug and led her to the couch. They’d been standing there since she’d gotten off the phone with the nurse, since Rio had literally and figuratively held her up as she received life-altering news.</p><p>Since she’d made a rash decision that was certainly going to change things between them, though she didn’t know exactly how, not yet.</p><p>They settled opposite one another, legs crossed, still a few inches away from touching. </p><p>“I was processing my feelings in my own time,” Rio began to explain. “And I probably would’ve said something soon. But I didn’t want to put pressure on you.” She reached over and brushed a hair out of Agatha’s face, tucking it carefully behind her ear. “You’ve had a lot going on.” </p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha hummed in agreement. She didn’t know the half of it—that <em> a lot going on </em> included navigating an extremely out-of-left-field attraction, and, dare she say it, crush.</p><p>Rio cocked her head at her, scooting closer so their knees brushed. “What <em> did </em> you want to talk about, by the way?”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha laughed tiredly. “Us. This,” she said, gesturing down at their interlaced hands. Rio’s nails were painted black, some of them chipped, no doubt from handling soil and plants all day. </p><p>“Really?” Rio did nothing to hide the shock in her voice. “And what had you planned on saying?” she asked curiously. “I know you’ve got a script rattling around somewhere in that overactive mind of yours.” </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, worrying the flesh between her teeth. While she’d explicitly asked for this—she’d even traded the damn fireworks for it—the vulnerability still caught in her throat. </p><p><em> Breathe, Harkness.</em> </p><p>“I was going to tell you how much I like being around you,” she started, casting her eyes down to her lap. “And that I’ve realised…” </p><p>Rio ran a reassuring thumb over the back of her hand, as if to say <em> keep going.</em> But fuck, she didn’t know if she could. Repeating it over and over in her mind was one thing, but saying it aloud was a different ball game. She blew a raspberry, exasperated at herself. “Sorry, I’m really shit at this.” </p><p>“You can tell me,” Rio encouraged softly. “Hey.” She tilted Agatha’s face so she had no choice but to look at her. “You can say whatever you want to say. I’m listening.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath. <em> You’re a grown woman, and you can do this</em>, she urged herself. “I’ve realised that I have feelings for you. That I’m… attracted to you,” she confessed, suddenly shy under the weight of Rio’s stare.</p><p>Her heart began to pound as the words fell out. “And although I made a huge fucking deal about even being your friend, I… would like to be more than friends. Or figure out what that looks like. If you, uh, want that too,” she finished hurriedly.</p><p>It sat in the small space between their bodies for a moment while Agatha searched Rio’s expression for an inkling of what she was feeling. She wasn’t sure what she hoped she’d find there—confirmation, maybe, or relief. </p><p>Eventually Rio hummed, like she was pondering something. “I guess I’ll have to think about it,” she said, but Agatha swore she saw a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Of all the iterations of the moment she’d turned over in her mind, she hadn’t predicted this one. Worse, she couldn’t tell if Rio was serious or not—her words said one thing, but the softening of her shoulders, the tightening of their joined hands, said another.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. “Okay,” she nodded quickly, though it stung in a way she couldn’t describe. But she owed Rio this. “Take all the time you need.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, then at her watch, the gold of it glinting in the midday sun streaming in through the windows. Her gaze lingered there for a minute, tongue pressing against the side of her cheek. <em> Wait</em>, she knew that look, that gesture. Was Rio… trying not to laugh?</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, trying to process what the fuck was happening—but before she could speak, Rio cut in. “Alright, I’ve had enough time to think about it,” she said flippantly, before leaning over and capturing her lips in another kiss.</p><p>Oh, she’d been played. <em> This fucking guy.  </em></p><p>She was going to kill her. She’d settle for kissing her first.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Turns out, there wasn’t a rulebook for how to share 1,200 square feet with someone you’d just kissed—Agatha was realising this quickly. After the initial shock of faux-rejection had worn off (and she’d berated Rio for giving her the fright of her fucking life) they’d kissed for a while longer, soft and chaste. </p><p>Every time they’d pulled back to breathe or readjust, something flickered in her chest, slight but unmistakably there. Like she was waiting for one of them to speak something into the quiet that would pop their bubble. But the words never came. </p><p>She could sense that Rio didn’t want to push; that she knew that Agatha’s confession had been delicate, held together by nerves and adrenaline. That Agatha herself was a little delicate right now, although she’d never admit it out loud.</p><p>Rio had eventually disappeared to shower, claiming she felt the stickiness of last night’s alcohol seeping from her pores. Her departure had been gentle, reinforced by a quick kiss to Agatha’s knuckles before she leapt up and strolled down the hallway to her room.</p><p>Now, in her absence, Agatha felt herself spinning again. It was disconcerting and prickly, wanting to actually talk about it like a fucking adult when all she’d ever done in the past was run or dodge.</p><p>The baby, obviously, was at the top of her mind. Before, her pregnancy had existed on a parallel track to her feelings for Rio. Now, they were about to crash into each other.</p><p>And then there was their living situation. The lack of physical distance that had made them grow so close in the first place now carried the potential to destroy it all.</p><p>Her worries had been stacking up like unpaid bills on the counter—always there, always consuming her attention, never quite getting dealt with. But she couldn’t keep defaulting to self-sabotage if this was going to go anywhere. Amidst the rumination, she was determined not to spiral again. At least, not alone. </p><p>So, yeah. Even though the mere thought of it made her feel like she was standing naked in front of a crowd, they needed to talk more.</p><p>Agatha went into the kitchen and started making a coffee. She pulled out a pod, then grumbled and reluctantly swapped it for a decaf one.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio entered the room, towelling off her wet hair from the shower. Her cheeks were rosy from the hot water. “Hi,” she said simply, pulling out a stool from under the island and perching on it. “Can I have a coffee, please? My head kinda hurts.” She leaned her cheek against one hand and looked up at Agatha, batting her eyelashes.</p><p>“You may,” Agatha nodded, a smile curling on her lips. Turning around, she rescued her mug from under the coffee maker and switched it with one of Rio’s, taking a sip of her own drink as she went.</p><p>After the machine dribbled out the last of the steaming hot coffee, she placed it in front of her, then grabbed the carton of oat milk creamer from the fridge. Rio eyed her appreciatively as she poured in a generous helping.</p><p>She let her take a few sips before releasing the words that had been building up inside her. “So, about that kiss…”</p><p>Rio looked up, her eyes just visible over the top of her cup. This one had a dinosaur on the front, with a tiny speech bubble that read <em> shit’s fucked</em>.</p><p>
<em> Yeah, and it was only going to get more fucked if they didn’t talk about it. </em>
</p><p>“What about it?” Rio asked carefully. Agatha caught the apprehension in her voice, and it served as a reminder that she wasn’t playing a one-person game. She racked her brain for the right way to settle her own anxieties without raising Rio’s hackles.</p><p>“What do we do now?” Agatha asked. She took a nervous gulp of coffee and waited for a response.</p><p>“What do you mean, <em> what do we do now</em>?” Rio chuckled, as if Agatha’s awkward attempt at discussing her feelings amused her.</p><p>“I mean, like…” Agatha sighed. “Aren’t we supposed to talk about this more?”</p><p>“Good god, I thought dating a straight woman would mean I’d be spared from all the talking,” Rio joked, burying her face in her hands.</p><p>“Well, last time I checked, you were a woman, so I’m clearly not straight,” Agatha deadpanned. Rio removed her hands from her face and rested them underneath her chin, revealing raised eyebrows and a vaguely surprised expression: <em> you said it, not me</em>.</p><p>And, <em> oh </em>—that was the first time she’d actually acknowledged her sexuality out loud. It drifted through the air and out the window, like it wasn’t all that serious. Not that she didn’t mean it—she definitely did, if the way her heart pounded in her ears when she kissed Rio was anything to go by. But just that it didn’t really matter.</p><p>She liked Rio, and Rio was a woman, and there wasn’t really much more to it than that. It nestled warmly under her skin, the soft and comforting feeling of progress.</p><p>“So, we’re… dating?” Agatha asked tentatively. </p><p>Rio shrugged. Her posture was relaxed, but it didn’t hide the hope that shone in her eyes. “I’d like to date you.”</p><p>The way she just said it took Agatha’s breath away for a second. She didn’t reply right away, too floored by the simplicity of it all. </p><p>It was yet another thing she wasn’t used to—being wanted without any conditions. But that was the problem—there <em> were </em>conditions. Messy, complicated ones.</p><p>She wanted to bring them to her attention, to wave all of her red flags in front of Rio’s face until she relented and admitted that <em> no</em>, she hadn’t thought about the repercussions of developing feelings for someone who was less than six months off having a baby, who was effectively her landlord, and who often had the emotional capacity of a shotglass.</p><p>Before Agatha could decide which one to broach, though, she noticed Rio falter, her grip tightening around the handle of the mug. She hadn’t affirmed her open admission of wanting to date aloud, and the doubt was probably filtering back in again. God, she was so bad at this.</p><p>She reached over and pried Rio’s fingers loose, taking her hand. Amidst all of the many threads in her mind, she <em> was </em>sure of one thing. “I want to date you, too.”</p><p>Again, Rio visibly relaxed, and it eased something in Agatha’s body at the same time. “Okay,” she said. A bashful smile crept over her face slowly. “Good.”</p><p>“It’s just…” Agatha cast a glance down at the swell of her abdomen. Earlier, she’d tugged on a t-shirt and found it too tight at the bottom, and it had made her oddly giddy. “I’m pregnant, and all.”</p><p>“Really?” Rio gasped. “That is brand-new information!”</p><p>“Christ,” Agatha muttered. “Is this what I’m signing up for? Dad jokes?” </p><p>“Mmm, the dad joke response would’ve been <em> hi pregnant, I’m Rio</em>.” </p><p>“Seriously,” she urged, though she couldn’t stop herself from letting out a laugh at Rio’s stupidity. Always armed with a joke to cut the tension. It was one of the things she liked so much about her—how easy Rio made things feel. </p><p>They couldn’t joke around it forever. “I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing,” Agatha admitted. “My life is complicated. But I want to try.”</p><p>Rio softened at the honest admission, giving her hand a gentle squeeze. “That’s okay,” she agreed. “We can go slow. Although,” she laughed as the thought hit her, “we did kinda accidentally U-Haul.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha groaned. “I’m already a lesbian stereotype.”</p><p>“Rite of passage,” Rio replied dryly. It made Agatha snort into her coffee.</p><p>When she looked back up, Rio’s gaze was focused. Determined. “Why don’t we start with a date?” she said. “Y’know, something outside of the four walls of this apartment, as lovely as it is.” </p><p>A date. That would be a good start—a way to get to know each other in this new context. An organic outlet for all the conversations that were seconds away from giving her an aneurysm. </p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha pretended to think it over. Obviously, it was a no-brainer. She’d go to the fucking garbage dump with Rio if she wanted her to, probably. “I guess because you asked so nicely…” </p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Rio said, cracking a smile.</p><p>“Fine, but it better not be something fucking cheesy like mini golf.” </p><p>Rio scoffed, pressing a hand to her chest as if Agatha’s brutal dismissal physically pained her. “Mini golf is indisputably a top five date idea.”</p><p>“Anything but mini golf,” she repeated, levelling Rio with a glare. </p><p>She held up two hands in surrender. “Okay, noted. I’m sure I can come up with something that’s more suited to your refined tastes,” she joked.</p><p>“I don’t even know what that looks like, anymore,” Agatha mused. “I haven’t been on a first date in seven years.”</p><p>“Yeah, well… I haven’t been on one that mattered in a while, either.” </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, the sincerity catching her off guard.</p><p>“So maybe we figure it out together,” Rio offered, voice quiet but sure. She reached across the kitchen island again, linking their fingers. “You set the pace. I’ll follow your lead.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After the morning they’d had, Agatha found herself yearning for normalcy. So, they’d made sandwiches together in the kitchen after both realising they hadn’t eaten all day, then devoured them at the dining table while Rio studied and Agatha moved words around aimlessly in a Google Doc.</p><p>Although she knew Rio would just humour more of her questions with a good-natured smile, the quiet was a nice reprieve from the heaviness of earlier.</p><p>The sun had almost set when Agatha stretched in her seat, noticing the uncomfortable ache that came with perching on a stiff dining chair for hours. She looked over at Rio, who was drumming her fingers against the keyboard, eyes glazed over.</p><p>She reached over and patted Rio’s hand to get her attention. “Movie?” she asked hopefully.</p><p>Rio tipped her head back and closed her eyes, like it was the best thing she’d ever heard. “Thought you’d never ask. I’ll get the takeout menus.” </p><p>“Or you could just use Uber Eats like a normal person,” Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“What can I say, I’m old school,” she shrugged, clicking her laptop closed and standing up. </p><p>While Rio rustled around in a kitchen drawer, Agatha made her way to the living room and relaxed onto the couch, flipping through movie options.</p><p>Horror didn’t really fit the vibe, though she wouldn’t say no to an excuse to hold Rio’s hand through the scary parts. Not that she really needed it—Agatha had never met a jumpscare she didn’t like. </p><p>Something mindless with lots of action and car chases might be better, but it would probably be too loud and overstimulating.</p><p>A romcom felt kinda on the nose… so if Rio asked, her finger had slipped. She cued up <em> When Harry Met Sally</em>—because the only good romance films, in her opinion, were from before the 2000s—and curled up against the couch cushions.</p><p>Rio walked back into the room a beat later, holding two menus. “Thai or Indian?” </p><p>“Thai,” Agatha replied. Indian was a one-way ticket to heartburn, and selfishly, she didn’t want to kiss Rio with biryani breath. That is, if they were going to kiss again.</p><p>“Pad see ew with… chicken? And egg rolls?” Rio asked, rattling off Agatha’s usual order. It made her chest flutter a little.</p><p>“Not gonna subject me to tofu this time?”</p><p>“Nah, healthy isn’t gonna do shit for this hangover,” Rio mused. “The beauty of flexitarianism.”</p><p>She stayed standing for a second, texting in the order to their local delivery place. “45 minutes. Start the movie while we wait?”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>She looked at the empty space next to her, then over at Rio expectantly. But Rio seemed to have other plans that started and ended with overthinking. Her eyes flicked between the armchair, where she usually sat on nights like these, to the couch that Agatha was currently occupying. </p><p>“Do you want to…” she said, trailing off before she could finish.</p><p><em> Yes </em> , she thought, answering Rio’s question in her head. Although, something about cuddling didn’t scream <em> slow </em> to her, not after what had happened when she let Rio give her a massage. </p><p>But the desire to get a little closer, to bring Rio back into her physical orbit like she’d been before, was too strong to second-guess what she said next.</p><p>“Have an excuse to sit close to you?” she quirked a brow. “I’d like that.” </p><p>Rio licked her lips, her gaze falling back to the sofa. In a few quick strides, she was settling there like they’d never left. Emboldened by the invitation, she snaked an arm around Agatha’s shoulders, stretching her legs out between them. Agatha curled into her, head resting below her collarbone.</p><p>“This okay?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>Agatha nodded up at her, relaxing into her grasp. It was wild, she realised, how quickly things could go from platonic to romantic. How the little rituals they’d established as friends lent themselves so easily to this new way of co-existing. </p><p>It wasn’t what she was used to. She’d never been <em> friends </em> with anyone she’d dated in the past—truth be told, she’d never more than tolerated any of her boyfriends. They’d just been outlets for her basic needs: help around the house, unresolved anger, and sex.</p><p>She’d never wanted to talk for hours, or spend the whole day with someone, or cuddle on the couch. She felt it, though, deeply and honestly—an invisible pull towards Rio.</p><p>While she was reluctantly okay with leaving her many other questions half-answered—for now, at least—there was one that had been nagging at her since last night. As Rio’s hand stroked her hair gently, Agatha shifted onto her side so she could look into her eyes.</p><p>“Yesterday, when Jen was here, she insinuated that maybe…” she began, searching for the words. The anxiety crept up unwittingly, making her face flush—but she pressed on. “That doing this all the time was holding you back, or something. That watching movies and eating takeout on the couch with me wasn’t exciting enough for you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m learning Jen likes to meddle,” she said, rolling her eyes. “But to reassure you, I very much enjoy doing nothing with you,” she continued easily. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” </p><p>“Really?” Agatha heard it over the top of the movie, the way her voice came out—needy. She cringed at the sound of it, but she couldn’t take it back. </p><p>Rio didn’t seem to care. “Yeah,” she said. “Take no notice of Jen. There’s no place I’d rather be right now.”</p><p>God, she was adorable. “You’re such a simp,” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Surprised you even know what that word means, old lady.”</p><p>“Hey,” she protested, swatting at Rio’s chest playfully. “Watch yourself, Vidal.”</p><p>Something dark flared in Rio’s eyes as Agatha’s hand made contact with the space between her breasts. She grabbed her hand and held it there, two fingers deliberately pressing against Agatha’s wrist, rubbing back and forth.</p><p>It felt entirely new again, and <em> fuck</em>, Agatha wondered how many changes in state she’d have to cope with in a single day. They’d gone from being friends this morning, to hesitantly kissing each other around noon, and now, as the light-sprinkled darkness of New York City blinked at them from out the open living room windows, Agatha knew they were about to cross another line.</p><p><em> Slow, my fucking ass.</em> </p><p>It was Rio who broached it first, pulling Agatha towards her and into a hungry kiss. She felt teeth graze against her bottom lip, then gasped as Rio bit down, taking advantage of her open mouth and slipping her tongue inside.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse ratcheted up as the kisses quickly became deeper, more bruising. Rio’s tongue licked into her mouth like she wanted to taste every inch of her. She returned the favour eagerly, seeking out the little gap between Rio’s teeth that winked at her every time she smiled.</p><p>She felt like she was about to explode, her desire only growing in size when Rio switched focus from her mouth to her bare skin, trailing kisses along her jaw and neck.</p><p>“Text the delivery driver,” Agatha panted, lifting herself upright and swinging one leg over Rio’s hips to straddle her. “Tell them to leave the food at the door.”</p><p>“Yes, boss.” Without breaking the connection between them, Rio wrestled her phone out of her pocket, shot off a quick text, then threw it halfway across the room onto the armchair. It landed face-down with a satisfying thump. “Now, where were we?”</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand firmly and clamped it down on her tit. “Right about here.” </p><p>Rio stilled for a moment, looking up at her under half-lidded eyes, hand resting on her breast. The movie played on in the background, and <em> oh</em>, that was Meg Ryan’s famed diner orgasm Agatha could hear. She’d barely noticed it over the sounds of their heavy breathing.</p><p>Agatha glanced down as Rio began circling her nipple through the thin cotton of her t-shirt. Like most days, she wasn’t wearing a bra—useless things they were. Satisfied, she removed her own hand and focused on Rio’s thighs, skimming careful fingers along the hem of her shorts, the olive of her skin. </p><p>She stared down into brown eyes, turned almost black with arousal. “Full of surprises,” Rio murmured softly, rolling a nipple between two fingers. </p><p>Agatha moaned as Rio reached up to palm her other breast, both hands full now. Her boobs had never been particularly sensitive before, and it made her wonder if it was the pregnancy or just Rio, touching her in a way that felt akin to something fucking holy without even taking her clothes off.</p><p>It occurred to her suddenly—she could have sex with Rio right now, right here on the couch in their living room. The fantasies she’d had in the lead-up to this could come to fruition if she just let it happen, if she ground her hips down against the firmness of Rio’s body and let her hand wander between her thighs.</p><p>She wanted it to play out—<em>Jesus Christ</em>, she wanted it. But beneath the hunger was something brittle, something that made her chest tighten. She wasn’t ready, as much as she wished she was. She needed this to last. And they’d agreed to go slow.</p><p>So if the thoughts that parried with her actions were right, which she suspected they were, Rio could wait a little longer—they could both wait a little longer.</p><p>“Stop, stop,” Agatha breathed, though she didn’t push Rio away. Their bodies stayed flush, but Rio’s hands travelled down to her waist immediately, holding her there as she obeyed her command.</p><p>There was nothing in Rio’s expression that indicated she was offended or hurt. It was just the same look she always fixed her with, the one that said <em> I’m here, I’m waiting.</em> <em>I’ll keep waiting</em>. </p><p>“Hey, you set the pace, remember?” Rio reminded her gently.</p><p>Maybe she could see the fear and desire waging war in Agatha’s mind, and maybe she couldn’t. Either way, she was thankful when Rio leaned up to kiss her, then helped her shift so they were head to chest again, Agatha’s leg draped over her hips.</p><p>They fell into silence, but it wasn’t thick or heavy—just calm. Rio’s fingers began to thread through her hair absentmindedly as they laid there, Agatha’s heart thumping through the thin layers of fabric resting between them.</p><p>She burrowed in closer, allowing the sounds of the TV to permeate their world again. Rio pressed a soft kiss to the top of her head, and Agatha draped a hand across her chest, their fingers interlinking and dangling off the edge of the couch.</p><p>They’d get there soon enough, Agatha knew. She’d be ready soon. But for now, she was content with just this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Waiting to have sex with Rio was hard, but waiting to go on a date with her was, surprisingly, much harder. Ever since Rio had dropped the invitation into her lap on Sunday, Agatha had been pent up, anticipating what this thing between them would look like in the light of day rather than the dim glow of the lamps in their apartment.</p><p>It wasn’t like they hadn’t talked, or kissed, or done any of a hundred new things since then. They definitely had. What were once friendly routines—eating together on the couch, working at the same table, skirting around each other in the kitchen—had become extremely non-platonic. </p><p>Now, making coffee was a two-person job that involved Agatha commandeering the Keurig while Rio fished their mugs out of the drawer (always her own, adorned with a cartoon character or a ridiculous slogan that Agatha would pretend not to find funny). She’d rest her chin on Agatha’s shoulder while they waited for the coffee to dribble out of the machine, winding a hand around her waist like she was anchoring them there.</p><p>It had started on Monday morning, and hadn’t stopped since. Watching TV had evolved into cuddling, working often came with company, and eating a meal together was just an excuse to look at Rio up close.</p><p>They’d made out a little more, too, but they always stopped before it got too heated—much to the disappointment of Agatha’s clit, which seemed to throb of its own accord the second Rio’s lips met hers. At this point, the sexual attraction between them was undeniable, and she could tell Rio felt it too. It was in the way she gripped the edge of the sofa like it was Agatha’s hip, and how she licked her lips every time they’d finished kissing, like she was trying to savour it for as long as she could.</p><p>Every micro sign from Rio was a splinter in Agatha’s resolve, inching her one step closer to caving in. And how could she not? Rio pranced around their apartment looking like a fucking smokeshow, her skin glowing in the afternoon light, tattoos rippling along one strong bicep. </p><p>Come to think of it, maybe waiting to have sex <em> was </em>harder.</p><p>Growing domesticity and attraction aside, the idea of spending time with Rio outside of the apartment just seemed more… intentional. A date was the perfect setting to gauge how Rio felt about the unspoken things between them, the reality that was pressing down on her each day as her belly grew.</p><p>Rio hadn’t told her what they were doing, but she’d been probing her all week in the hopes she’d drop a hint. Or rather, a clear indication it wasn’t mini golf.</p><p>
<em> “Okay, so what should I wear on this mysterious date?” Agatha asked, feet in Rio’s lap as they sprawled out on the couch. </em>
</p><p><em> “Something summery,” Rio replied easily, not turning away from the TV, where </em> RuPaul’s Drag Race <em> was blaring away, casting a purple glow over the living room. </em></p><p>
<em> “Like, trying to hit a stupid little ball into a stupid little hole while children scream in the distance kinda summery?” </em>
</p><p><em> “I’ve already promised not to torture you, Agatha,” she chuckled, turning her head to give her a look that said </em> you’re impossible<em>. “Although, I cannot guarantee a lack of screaming children.” </em></p><p>Saturday eventually rolled around in the way that lazy summer weekends did, with no real sense of urgency. Agatha woke feeling good, freed from the groggy weightedness she’d become accustomed to in the first few months of pregnancy.</p><p>Like all the books and websites had told her, the second trimester was a reprieve. Her energy was back, sleep came more easily, and things didn’t feel so heavy, especially with the amnio behind her.</p><p>Maybe there were other reasons for that, too. Ones she couldn’t blame on hormones.</p><p>Rio had told her to be ready to leave by 11, but it was barely past nine, so she padded out into the hallway to see if she was around. There was nothing to say they couldn’t start their date a little earlier, although breakfast was probably a morning-after kinda thing, not morning-before.</p><p>She wandered through the apartment, but Rio wasn’t there. Agatha sighed, puffing out her bottom lip. Maybe she had gone for a run, or to get some groceries—her shelves of the fridge were looking empty. Wherever she was, though, she wasn’t <em> here</em>. Worse, Agatha <em> wanted </em>her to be here, and that was problematic.</p><p>Humans weren’t supposed to get used to things this quickly. It took 21 days to form a habit, and they’d been doing this for… six. So why did the space Rio usually occupied feel so glaringly empty?</p><p>Agatha forced herself to think about something else—anything else—while she went about her usual morning routine on autopilot, just missing the component she’d grown all too accustomed to. </p><p>She needed to call Wanda and ask how the conference was… although she’d been putting that off in case Wanda asked about Rio. She also needed to text Billy about the Broadway tickets she’d promised him… but she’d also been putting that off in case <em> he </em>asked about Rio. </p><p><em> Fuck </em>. Now all she could think about was Rio, and why she wasn’t here in her space, laughing at her sarcastic jokes or offering useless nature facts with a lopsided grin.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hand and blinked when she realised she still hadn’t taken a sip of coffee. <em> That </em> was a first. Worse, in her attempt at distraction, she’d picked up a Rio mug, the one with Snoopy on the front holding a vinyl record.</p><p>Chugging as much caffeine as she could in a single mouthful, she shot off a text and prayed it didn’t come across desperate.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b> <em> You out? The coffee maker has no idea what to do in your absence. </em></p><p>As soon as she’d sent it, the speech bubble glowing blue, Agatha slammed her phone face down on the counter. That was a hallmark of a bad idea, right—instant regret? </p><p>Although, the clamminess in her hands didn’t feel the same way regret typically did. It was sweatier and sharper, more heart-racing than heart-sinking. She groaned and tried to drown herself in another gulp of coffee as she let herself see it for what it was—nerves. </p><p>Her phone vibrated angrily against the countertop before they had more of a chance to build. She flipped it over tentatively and saw the text was from Rio, then fumbled to open it much faster than she’d care to admit.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> yeah, just had to run an errand. tell the ‘coffee maker’ i miss her too. be back before 11 </em>💚</p><p>Agatha stared down at her phone, lips twitching up into a smile without warning. It flooded her body immediately, washing away the anxiety and replacing it with something warmer. </p><p>Rio had, predictably, seen right through her. Better yet—or worse, depending on how you looked at it—Rio <em> missed </em>her. And though the words wouldn’t spill from her lips as easily, she missed Rio, too.</p><p>It was so sweet and effortless that it made her feel sick. Because this wasn’t what she did: fell for people so fast. Fell for people at all, really. Her catalogue of failed relationships was proof of that. She’d always had one foot out the door from the very start, too cautious and guarded to let anyone all the way in.</p><p>Agatha had relaxed her boundaries exactly once before Rio, and look how that had turned out. A baby on the way, fatherless and unaware of the shitstorm it would be born into. A life she certainly hadn’t planned.</p><p>And now, through the same unpredictable chain of events, a goddamn Snoopy mug she couldn’t stop smiling at.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>By quarter to 11, Agatha was as ready as she’d ever be for what came next. She finished up her makeup with a touch of lipgloss and stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. </p><p>Same blue eyes. Same brown hair. A slightly different body to the one she was used to, what with the way her boobs and belly had begun to grow over the last few weeks—but not different enough to count for much. </p><p>And she didn’t want it to, not today. Today, she wanted to just be Agatha, not someone’s future mom. Not the person carrying all the baggage, the one responsible for the literal bump in her road with Rio. </p><p>Just a woman, about to go on a date with another woman that she really, <em> really </em>liked—a plot twist she hadn’t expected, but that she was surprisingly okay with.</p><p>She adjusted a loose strand of hair, then leaned closer to the mirror. No visible traces of breakfast in her teeth. No mascara smudges. Good enough.</p><p>She’d already heard the telltale <em> click </em> of the front door as she was getting ready, signalling Rio had arrived home. When she walked out into the living room, there she was, waiting for her on the couch. She stood immediately, a small bouquet of flowers dangling from one hand. <em> Ever the gentleman.  </em></p><p>“Fuck, you look good,” Rio breathed, drinking her in with her eyes. She placed a hand on the curve of Agatha’s waist, brushing against the lavender lace of the halterneck dress she’d picked out. It was probably the girliest outfit in Agatha’s entire closet, a far cry from her usual uniform of sweats and a t-shirt, or the power suits she’d don for book tours and work meetings.</p><p>She’d put it on because Rio had specified <em> summer</em>. And also because it made her feel the way Rio saw her—softer. Nicer. The kind of person who was worthy of receiving flowers from a pretty girl; of being looked at like she’d hung the damn moon.</p><p>“You look good, too,” Agatha said. And she did—Rio always did. She had a striped blue button down and white shorts on, sandals on her feet. Her hair was loose, how Agatha liked it, and a simple gold chain hung around her neck. </p><p>After she’d thoroughly taken her in, Agatha’s eyes darted back to the hand resting at Rio’s side. A smile played on her lips. “More flowers, huh?”</p><p>“Kinda feels like tradition at this point,” Rio chuckled, handing them to Agatha. They were pink with spots of yellow and brown streaks across the petals. </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said, leaning up to plant a grateful peck on Rio’s cheek. “They’re beautiful. What do these ones mean?” </p><p>Rio looked at her for a second, considering something, before she broke into a mysterious smirk. “I am not at liberty to disclose that information.”</p><p>“Don’t think I won’t Google it later, Vidal,” Agatha warned. Rio just shrugged mischievously.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was smiling, genuinely. She quickly tucked the flowers into a vase in the kitchen, then grabbed her bag. “Ready?”</p><p>A short walk later, the pair were standing at the entrance to Marsha P. Johnson Park, which was already packed with people and food stands. Agatha took it all in—the families laid out on the grass, enjoying the sun. Kids playing, people milling about trying various foods. A busker singing a tolerable rendition of a love song from the 90s.</p><p>It was, Agatha would admit, the right place for their first date. Rio had chosen well. Not too high pressure, like an activity she’d probably be shit at. Busy enough that they’d have a little privacy, but open enough that it didn’t feel like hiding. And no alcohol involved, lest Agatha forget who she was for a second and accidentally ask the waiter for a whisky. </p><p>Rio took her by the hand and started guiding them through the throngs of people, pointing out their various lunch options. After much deliberation, they landed on a Mexican food truck painted in colors so bright they hurt Agatha’s eyes, ordering a bunch of tacos to share and two sugary Mexican Cokes.</p><p>They wandered over to a semi-secluded spot on the outskirts of the market, and Rio made a show of laying down a picnic blanket from her tote before she let Agatha sit down. It clicked—that was probably the errand Rio had snuck out of the house to do this morning, along with the flowers. </p><p>Half an hour passed by breezily as they ate their tacos and traded banter back and forth. There wasn’t much to catch up on from the past week, because they lived together and talked every fucking day—and yet, they kept unearthing new topics, from where Rio’s endearing obsession with wildlife came from (National Geographic had offered an escape from the New York City concrete as a kid) to why Agatha had become an author (she liked words and clearly hated being well-paid).</p><p>Once their food was just a distant memory, Coke bottles close to empty, Rio leaned in conspiratorially, like she was about to share a long-held secret with Agatha. </p><p>It didn’t come—instead, she just looked her straight in the eye and said: “Have I told you how pretty you are?”</p><p><em> Ugh, this smooth motherfucker. </em>“Yes,” Agatha sighed, though there was no trace of annoyance in her tone. “Like four times since we left the house.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio acknowledged. “What’s one more?” she shrugged, before leaning in for a kiss. Agatha returned it without hesitation. “You’re really pretty,” Rio murmured against her lips.</p><p>“Keep it in your pants,” Agatha replied, smiling into the kiss.</p><p>“Trying my goddamn best.”</p><p>It prompted a quick snort of laughter from Agatha, and an accompanying twinge low in her gut, a fleeting reminder that she, too, was trying her goddamn best not to jump Rio in a public park. It wasn’t working.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck, angling to deepen the kiss. Agatha’s tongue slid along Rio’s bottom lip, eliciting a happy hum as she opened her mouth to permit its entry. They stayed like that for a moment, all-but-making out in broad daylight, the taste of tacos on their tongues—until Rio whipped around, breaking from Agatha’s hold and clutching the back of her head.</p><p>“Ouch!” Rio exclaimed. “What the hell was that?” she muttered, before her eyes landed on the offending object—a tiny, soft soccer ball. She huffed a laugh, picking it up, then scanned the crowd to see where it had come from. </p><p>Agatha watched in amusement as a small boy ran towards them, then looked at Rio, eyes wide. He couldn’t have been more than three or four, clad in a t-shirt with a dinosaur on it. He had blonde ringlets spilling out from underneath a little hat, and a pout on his mouth that Agatha could tell was a few seconds away from turning into a full-blown meltdown.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said, lip wobbling. He stood at the edge of their picnic blanket like there was an invisible threshold he was too scared to cross. “I didn’t mean to hit you.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s okay.” Rio tossed the ball back to him and smiled. “It was an accident. Don’t worry about it, bud,” she said, her voice gentle. The little boy still looked like he was on the verge of tears, but Rio reached out a hand and gave him an encouraging squeeze on the shoulder. Though it was a little watery, it made him smile—it made Agatha smile, too. </p><p>“Noah!” a voice called out from across the park. Agatha averted her gaze from Rio and the boy and watched as an equally as blonde woman came running over to them, looking harried. She stopped next to what was presumably her son and gave both women an apologetic look.</p><p>“Are you guys okay?” the mom asked, pressing a hand to her forehead. “Sorry, he knows he’s supposed to be careful of other people when he’s playing. Don’t you, baby?” she chided gently, looking at the boy. </p><p>“Yes, mom,” he replied, casting his eyes down guiltily. </p><p>“He’s perfectly fine,” Rio reassured her, smiling. “It’s all good.” </p><p>“Thank you,” she replied gratefully. She turned to her son, crouching down to his level. “Why don’t you go back over there and see what mama’s doing?” she asked, pointing to a waving woman over by the food trucks. He lit up instantly and began to run in her direction, both moms tracking him with their eyes as he did.</p><p>“Kids, right?” the woman sighed, smiling nervously. “Do you two have any more?” she asked, glancing down at where Agatha’s hand rested on her belly, then over to Rio. </p><p>Oh god, not this again—it was the doctor’s office all over. She hadn’t said anything to correct Goldberg because it hadn’t really mattered then.</p><p>This time, she and Rio were <em> different</em>. They were dating, whatever that actually meant in future terms. Agatha didn’t know what the next few days would bring, let alone the months until she gave birth.</p><p>And who was to say whether Rio would still be here, then—whether this thing between them would be given the grace to evolve alongside the new chapter of her life. There was still so much to figure out, and they were barely out of the gate.</p><p>“Uh, no,” Agatha answered. The words felt clumsy on her tongue. “It’s my first.”</p><p>She caught Rio’s eye as she responded, just for a second, and was met with a careful expression. Not fear, or pity, or disappointment. Just awareness, and maybe a little discomfort.</p><p>The woman smiled awkwardly, looking between them. “Well, congratulations. You’re glowing.”</p><p>Agatha held back a sarcastic reply; stopped herself from making a parting dig about assuming people were pregnant. Instead, she just gave the woman a tight smile and waved her off as she crossed the park back to her son and his other mom.</p><p>It had been a small, fleeting moment, but it landed with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.</p><p>Rio was great with kids—her gentleness around the little boy was evidence of that. Agatha had seen it a little at Wanda’s barbecue, but Billy and Tommy were teenagers, and she hadn’t been paying attention in the same way she was now. </p><p>Asking exactly what she wanted to ask would be a fucking terrible idea, especially now she'd seen the hesitant look on Rio's face. It was too soon; they were too new. But maybe she could fill in some of the blanks without erring into dangerous territory.</p><p>“What were you like as a kid?” Agatha asked tentatively. </p><p>Rio pursed her lips thoughtfully. “I was always getting into trouble,” she acknowledged. “My mom didn’t know what to do with all my energy, I don’t think. One time I got stuck in a tree in Central Park,” she laughed. “Had to call a bunch of her friends to help me get down.” </p><p>She tried to picture it—a little dark-haired girl with a gap-toothed smile, growing up in a concrete jungle when all she wanted to do was be in nature.</p><p>“I’m sure they didn’t mind coming to your rescue. I have no doubt you were extremely cute,” Agatha smiled, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio grinned. “The cutest.”</p><p>Agatha slid her eyes downwards, pretending to find the label of her Coke interesting so as not to make Rio feel crowded. “Tell me more about your family.”</p><p>After a moment, Rio spoke quietly. “What do you want to know?”</p><p><em> Everything</em>, Agatha thought. But that would be coming on too strong. She flicked her gaze back up to look at her. “You mentioned your mom, the other day. And your abuela once.”</p><p>“You have a good memory,” Rio laughed awkwardly, running a hand through her hair. </p><p>Agatha picked up on the deflection, her stomach clenching protectively as she wondered whether to leave it and move onto something lighter. She’d already made it clear to Rio that she was here if she wanted to talk about her mom. It wouldn’t be right to press too hard on an obvious wound. </p><p>But she longed to know more about Rio—to unearth more about why this kind, funny, generous human was the way she was. About the people who had made her so good, though they hadn’t been afforded very much time together.</p><p>“You don’t have to, if you don’t want to.” </p><p>“No, I—” Rio shook her head. “It’s just not a very fun story. Definitely not dream first date material.”</p><p>“I think we can stop pretending that this is like any other first date,” Agatha said wryly. “We’re a little too complicated for that.” </p><p>Rio chuckled in agreement, leaning back against the picnic blanket. One hand wandered to its edge and began to pick distractedly at a blade of grass.</p><p>“So… family?” As she said it, Agatha decided it would be the last time she’d ask—if Rio didn’t give her anything now, she’d wait for her to open up in her own time.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “No dad. Never in the picture,” she said. “He could be dead, for all I know.” </p><p>“My abuela was in Puerto Rico, where my mom’s family is from,” she continued. Her expression turned softer as she spoke about her. “She died a couple years ago.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled a breath. She’d known this would be heavy—but maybe she’d misjudged exactly <em> how </em> heavy. It landed in her own stomach like a stone, the realisation that Rio, just like her, had no blood relatives. It made her even more thankful for Lilia, the stand-in mom she’d yet to meet, and Alice, the unofficial sister who’d kept Rio afloat all these years.</p><p>They were to Rio like Wanda and Billy were to her. It didn’t take many, but it took work—on all sides.</p><p>“And your mom?” Agatha asked gently. She already knew the answer to this one, and it only held more pain. “You said she died, too, right?” </p><p>“Mmm-hmm,” Rio nodded. Her eyes flicked towards the blue sky overhead. “When I was thirteen.”</p><p>“I’m guessing you were close, at that age?”</p><p>“Yeah. She was my favorite person.”</p><p>“That must have been…” Agatha shook her head, trying to process it—the magnitude of grief Rio had dealt with before she’d barely hit puberty. “Very fucking hard. I’m sorry,” she finally said, though the words felt inadequate. </p><p>They did little to fill the space between them, but at least they didn’t drive Rio away, as she fixed Agatha with a wan smile. “It’s okay,” she said quietly. “She’s been gone a long time.”</p><p>Agatha reached for something else to say, but it all just seemed too small. Instead, she shifted closer to Rio and rested a hand on her knee, hoping it would ease the discomfort a little.</p><p>“What about you?” Rio asked. Though a natural shift in the conversation, Agatha understood—that was enough, for now. She wanted to ask how Rio’s mom had died, what she’d been like, what her favorite memories of her were… but those questions could come at a later date. </p><p>Though she still wasn’t a hundred percent sure, it didn’t seem like Rio was going anywhere. At least, not yet.</p><p>“A similar story, unfortunately,” Agatha answered, then frowned. Well, similar in some ways, but starkly different in others. “Although there wasn’t as much love lost when my mother finally kicked it,” she clarified with an awkward laugh.</p><p>“Doesn’t sound like it,” Rio raised an eyebrow. “Can I ask why?”</p><p>“She wasn’t exactly the best parent. Neither was my dad. I don’t think they really thought about the implications of having a child.”</p><p>“I spent most of my time with babysitters or alone,” she continued. “Do you know what a latchkey kid is, or are you too young?”</p><p>“I know what it is,” Rio chuckled. </p><p>“Well, that was me. Until my mother—Evanora, her name was—needed an outlet for her anger. Someone to scream at at the end of a long day. That was pretty much my only use.” </p><p>She didn’t mention the parts where her mother would starve her for days on end, or send her to school with dirty clothes and unwashed hair. The time she locked her in a linen closet for a whole day, like some even more fucked up version of <em> Matilda </em> or <em> Harry Potter</em>.</p><p>She’d already done a fantastic job of keeping those memories buried, and while letting Rio in was becoming easier by the day, it felt like its own can of worms—vulnerability that existed on an entirely different plane to letting Rio touch her or admitting that they missed each other.</p><p>They were getting there, but it still made sense to keep some parts of her protected. Especially ones she’d never told anyone before, except Wanda, who’d witnessed it all in real time. </p><p>“After my dad died, she took more of an interest in me. I was 20 and I desperately wanted <em> not </em> to care about what she thought, after the shit she’d put me through as a kid,” Agatha continued, sighing. “But I did. So I spent most of my adult life trying to please her, even from afar when I moved to New York. It never really worked.”</p><p>“And after she died?”</p><p>“Tried to care less about what other people thought. Still did, though. Still do,” she said. </p><p>Rio hummed softly. Her fingers flexed before settling against Agatha’s, on top of her knee. “I don’t know, I think you’re doing a pretty good job at living for yourself.”</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha agreed half-heartedly. She was trying, but sometimes it didn’t feel like enough. The last few weeks did, though.</p><p>“So everybody’s dead,” Rio huffed a laugh. “Morbid shit.” </p><p>“You can say that again,” Agatha agreed. She rolled out her shoulders, suddenly a little sore from sitting on the hard ground of the park for the past few hours. </p><p>“Hey, I’m getting kinda tired,” she admitted. She’d been so busy talking to Rio, simply enjoying her uninterrupted company, that the time had flown by—but now her waning energy was catching up to her. “Just growing a human things. Wanna go back home?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio agreed easily, lifting herself to her feet. She stuck out a hand and helped Agatha up. “Okay to walk?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s not far.” </p><p>Agatha grabbed their stuff while Rio packed up the picnic blanket and took their empty lunch containers over to the nearest trash can. When she returned, she smiled and took Rio’s hand. “Thank you for today,” she said. “It was really nice.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio responded with a sweet, open smile of her own. “Thanks for coming along for the ride.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>“I need a nap,” Agatha announced, dumping her bag on the counter with the weariness of a soldier returning from war. The walk home had been short, but as they neared the apartment, she’d struggled to put one foot in front of the other, too tired to keep her limbs in constant motion.</p><p>“I don’t blame you,” Rio agreed with a chuckle. After all, she’d been the one dragging Agatha by the hand for the last few blocks. “I’m mere minutes away from a food coma.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio as the idea took shape in her mind. “This might be weird,” she started, heart thumping in her throat. Still, she didn’t want their date to end. “Do you… want to join me?”</p><p>A soft smile formed on Rio’s face. “That honestly sounds amazing,” she said.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha held her hand out for Rio to take, then led her down the hallway to her room. She opened the door and let out a relieved breath at the tidiness of her space, a far cry from the depression pit she’d lived in when Rio had first arrived. Thank god she’d made the bed that morning—and remembered to tuck her vibrator away in a drawer.</p><p>“I’ve never been in your bedroom before,” Rio mused, wandering around the room. She ran a finger along the spines of the books that decorated the windowsill before turning back around to face her.</p><p>“Well, this is it,” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“It’s very you,” Rio appraised.</p><p>Agatha just smiled, small and careful, then eased herself onto the bed. She couldn’t be bothered changing into something more comfortable—her eyelids were already growing heavy, energy sapped from a day spent in the sun. She looked over at Rio and patted the left side of the bed.</p><p>Rio rounded it and sat on the edge, kicking off her sandals. She sat there for a moment, twisting her body to face Agatha. The look on her face was open and hopeful, but laced with a little uncertainty. Agatha reached out her hand again, a sign of reassurance, and pulled Rio onto the bed gently by the arm. </p><p>She stretched out her legs, then slung a hand over Agatha’s waist and nestled into the crook of her shoulder. Agatha turned outwards and let herself be spooned, sinking into the warmth of Rio’s embrace.</p><p>It felt like the most intimate thing they’d done yet, more so than kissing, or cuddling, or even Rio palming her hips and breasts and thighs. </p><p>But Agatha also felt more comfortable than she had in years—maybe ever. It put her at ease as her eyes fluttered shut and she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>When she woke up a few hours later, there was no sun left in the sky. The view outside her bedroom window was an inky black, peppered, as always, by the twinkling lights of New York City. </p><p>The view in front of her, though—that was the real sight to behold. At some point during their nap, Agatha had turned around in Rio’s arms so they were face to face. And what a face it was.</p><p>She flipped on her bedside lamp and took in all the details, a mental picture that promised to stick with her for a while. Rio’s hair fanned out across the pillow. The perfect slope of her nose. The few tiny freckles that dotted her skin, along her forehead and cheeks.</p><p>Her eyes travelled down to where their bodies were touching. One of Rio’s hands had slipped under the short hem of her dress—not inappropriately, just resting there on her thigh like a comfort. But the contact burned her skin, anticipation flaring red hot and igniting the space between them.</p><p>Well, at least for Agatha. Rio was still asleep, her breathing low and even. </p><p>She leaned in and pressed a hand to Rio’s where it laid against her thigh, before brushing her lips to Rio’s cheek. It was gentle, but it was enough to make amber eyes flutter open and lock straight onto hers.</p><p>Rio hummed contentedly, a lazy smile stretching across her face as she woke up. She looked like she was about to say something, but Agatha pressed a finger to her mouth before she could. They’d done more than enough talking for today. </p><p>Agatha wanted—no, needed—something else. Something she felt like she’d been waiting fucking eons for. She cupped Rio’s face and drew her close, replacing her finger with her lips.</p><p>Though she’d just been unceremoniously ripped from sleep, Rio responded instantly to the firmness of the kiss, threading one hand into the hair at the back of Agatha’s neck. Her other hand made the climb from Agatha’s thigh to her hip, and it took everything in her not to moan when Rio gave it a testing squeeze. </p><p>The movement bunched Agatha’s dress up, revealing her underwear, and…<em> shit</em>. This was the part where they usually stopped. Clothes on, skin unmarked, ache never truly satisfied. But as the space between them fizzed with energy, there was no way in hell they were stopping now. </p><p>Agatha broke away from the kiss with one quick swipe of her tongue across Rio’s lips. Rio cottoned on before Agatha could say anything. “Do you want to keep going?” she breathed, toying with the hem of Agatha’s dress.</p><p>“Fuck, yes.” It came out like a plea. “Do you?” </p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio gulped, eyes turning dark. Her voice was husky and low—perhaps from sleep, or perhaps from what they were about to do. “I’ve been thinking about getting my hands on you ever since I saw you in this dress this morning.”</p><p>“Then do it,” Agatha encouraged.</p><p>Rio didn’t need any more convincing. She braced one hand on the bed and rolled them off their sides, climbing on top of her carefully while Agatha settled against the pillows. </p><p>She hovered there for a second, clearly cautious of dropping any weight against Agatha’s stomach, but—<em>fuck that</em>. She was pregnant, not a porcelain doll. It’d be at least another month before laying on her back became an issue, and two or three more before her belly really made things difficult.</p><p>And while she hoped they’d get to navigate those moments together when they came, she needed Rio to fuck her now, any which way. So she fisted her hands into Rio’s shirt and drew her in.</p><p>As Rio began to deliver kisses to her jaw, though, Agatha could still sense her hesitation. Her ministrations, while continuous, were tentative.</p><p>“Are you okay?” she murmured, angling her head to look Rio in the eye.</p><p>She gave her a bashful smile. “I’ve just... never done this before.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s my line,” Agatha joked off-handedly, before pushing Rio back lightly, eyes wide and panic flaring. “Hang on, what do you mean you’ve never done this before?”</p><p>“No, you dummy,” Rio blushed. “I mean I’ve never been with someone <em> pregnant </em> before.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a slow sigh of relief. “Honestly, I should hope not,” she replied. “I’m not one to kink-shame, but… I don’t love the idea of you fucking other pregnant women.” </p><p>“I just—” Rio stilled. She leaned in again, face close enough to Agatha’s that she could feel the warmth of her breath against her cheek. “I don’t want to hurt you.” </p><p>“You won’t,” Agatha said softly, bringing her hand up to tuck Rio’s bangs behind her ear. Bolder, she pressed a kiss there. “Unless I ask you to,” she whispered. </p><p>Rio groaned, guttural and instinctive. “You’re trying to kill me.” </p><p>Agatha bit back a <em> not if you kill me first</em>. Instead, she just hummed in agreement as Rio dipped her head to suck at the column of her throat, tongue pressing against her pulse point.</p><p>She kept travelling down, leaving open-mouthed kisses along her neck, then her collarbone, then the space between her breasts that was exposed by the halter of her dress. She lingered there for a moment, sucking the tight skin of her sternum into her mouth. Agatha could feel the wetness collecting between her thighs as Rio licked at the mark she’d undoubtedly left.</p><p>“Off?” Rio asked, raising her head from Agatha’s chest to tug at the dress’s hem. She sounded breathless, and Agatha revelled in it as she wriggled up to sit against the headboard and lifted her arms to help. Rio eased the dress up and off her, reaching a hand behind her to untie the halterneck when it got in the way.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t thought much about what being naked in front of Rio would be like. She’d been too focused on stopping them from getting there too quickly—a fucking stupid idea, in hindsight. But it was hitting her now, as Rio tossed her dress onto the floor.</p><p>She grappled with the instinct to cover herself up as her half-clothed body was revealed, to snake an arm across the budding roundness of her belly. Pregnancy was making her soft in more ways than one, and it would only continue to do so as the months passed.</p><p>Would Rio still want her then? Did Rio still want her <em> now</em>?</p><p>The panic flooded her chest as she flicked her gaze up to the fucking goddess of a woman that was now straddling her, knees bracketing her thighs, hands resting atop her shoulders.</p><p>Rio didn’t have to speak to answer Agatha’s question—her reaction provided more than enough relief. Agatha felt dangerously close to crying as Rio raked her eyes over her underwear-clad form with pure, unbridled appreciation. </p><p>She did speak, though, each word loosening something Agatha hadn’t realised was tightly coiled inside her. “You are…” Rio breathed, shaking her head. “Something else.” She ran her hands down Agatha’s arms, taking the straps of her bra with her, then pulled down the cups to expose her tits. “Fucking perfect,” she murmured, eyes widening. </p><p>Agatha didn’t have the strength to reply, not as Rio lowered herself down and captured one of her breasts between her lips. Agatha gasped at the feeling of Rio’s mouth wrapped around her nipple, the way her tongue circled and flicked against the bud as it tightened. </p><p>She instinctively reached out to grab a fistful of Rio’s hair, holding her there while she laved away. Rio’s eyes darted up to meet hers, expression a mix of shock and satisfaction. Agatha loosened her hold for a second, but then Rio uttered a soft “please”. So she gripped the strands tighter, coiling them into a makeshift bun while Rio went to town on her tits. </p><p>Her other hand floundered around on the bed, seeking purchase on the sheets as her cunt began to ache. <em> Oh good god</em>, she’d happily die like this. The cliche rattled around in her brain like a pinball, but Jesus, it was true—it was unlike anything she’d ever felt before. And Rio hadn’t even taken her underwear off.</p><p>As if she could hear her thoughts, Rio eased one leg over to slide a knee between Agatha’s thighs, pressing it right against her centre. “This okay?” she asked, her teeth grazing against Agatha’s nipple.</p><p>“Very, very okay,” Agatha confirmed, bucking her hips gently against Rio’s knee. Rio leaned in further, driving her knee roughly into Agatha’s core, where it met her clit through the lace of her underwear with a jolt. She released her nipple, then, seemingly done with her boobs for now, ran her hands along Agatha’s waist down to her hips. Agatha dropped her hold on Rio’s hair, sending it cascading back around her shoulders. </p><p> She shivered as Rio hooked one questioning finger under the side of her underwear. She could already feel how fucking soaked she was, her body responding to Rio’s touch like it was the most natural thing in the world. But before she surrendered fully, there was one thing she had to do. </p><p>“Hold on,” Agatha whispered. “I want to see you, too,” she said. She reached for the collar of Rio’s shirt and waited for a response, which was received in the form of a nod that could only be described as lustful. Her fingers trembled as she made quick but clumsy work of the buttons and exposed a simple white bralette.</p><p>As she pulled Rio’s shirt off and flung it across the room, her mouth went dry at the sight of two things.</p><p>First, Rio’s tits. While they were still covered, the bra was thin and sheer enough to reveal pert, dark nipples straining against the fabric.</p><p>Second, the answer to a question that had definitely crossed her mind more than once. A fine tattoo of two intersecting flowers, nestled between her breasts.</p><p>“Jesus.” Agatha didn’t know which one she wanted to put her mouth on first, only that she very much did. Soon.</p><p>Rio smirked down at her, then grabbed her hand and guided it behind her to unclasp the bra. Agatha reached up needily and practically ripped it off her, discarding it somewhere in the vicinity of her shirt. Her eyes boggled at the unadulterated sight of Rio’s tits—they were perfect. She wondered if that made her a boobs girl.</p><p>The impulse to reach out and touch felt animalistic, and Agatha was powerless against it. She satisfied the tactile need that had built in her quickly, palming a bare breast, then rolling a nipple between forefinger and thumb. Rio tipped her head back at the contact, moaning as Agatha dove in and swapped fingers for her mouth.</p><p>Agatha wished she could record her and set the sound as her ringtone. It would be weird, sure. But it wouldn’t be a disproportionate response.</p><p>She dragged her tongue from one nipple to the other, pausing in the middle to lick broad strokes along Rio’s tattoo. “Fuck, I love your boobs,” she panted, flicking her eyes upwards. Rio was smirking, staring down at Agatha like an angel. “I love boobs, period.”</p><p>“Glad I could help you figure that out, sweetheart,” Rio said, gently stroking the top of Agatha’s head. “Now, while I don’t want to rush you or anything…” she considered. “I’d really like to put my mouth on you now. Would you like that?” </p><p><em> Yes, fuck, please. </em> Agatha had to pick one. Wait, no she didn’t. “Yes, fuck,” she gasped, “please.”</p><p>The smirk on Rio’s face curled into a grin. She swung her other leg over Agatha’s hips so she was kneeling next to her, then grabbed a pillow from the other side of the bed. Reaching out a hand, she lifted Agatha up just enough to place it underneath her lower back, then scooted both her and the pillow a little down the bed with strong hands. </p><p>“Okay like this?” Rio checked, crawling across the bed to settle at her feet.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha breathed. At its core, it was considerate—but it was also weirdly <em> hot</em>, being thought of like this. She was used to having to take control, not being handed it. Rio was hitting all the right notes, factoring her into every decision, but she sensed she still had the upper hand—that Rio would happily do as she asked, if she just dared to voice it. </p><p>She decided to test out the theory. “Hang on, shorts off first,” Agatha chastised. “Let’s even this out.” Rio obliged, scrambling to tug them down her legs. Agatha tried to bite back a laugh, but it bubbled out of her awkwardly anyway. </p><p>Because of course Rio was wearing tightie-whities. And of course they looked so fucking hot on her, more so than any man who’d ever worn them in her presence. </p><p>“What?” Rio pouted. “Is my choice of underwear funny to you?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha chuckled. “You’re just very cute.”</p><p>“The least you could do is tell me I’m <em> sexy </em> before I eat you out,” she grumbled, wrenching her hair up into a bun and securing it with a hair tie from her wrist.</p><p>Agatha propped herself up onto her elbows and stared Rio down. “You are, without a doubt, the sexiest thing I have ever seen. Happy now?”</p><p>She saw Rio’s throat bob as she swallowed. “Fuck yes.” She wriggled around for a second, settling on her stomach, then grabbed the back of Agatha’s knees to pull her closer.</p><p>Agatha felt herself clench around nothing, the anticipation threatening to push her over the edge. This was, without a fragment of a doubt, the longest time she’d ever spent waiting to be railed by someone—but every fucking second of drawn-out foreplay had been <em> perfect</em>, so much so that she almost didn’t want it to end. </p><p>Rio tapped the inside of Agatha’s thigh with one finger, looking up from between her legs. “If you need a minute or for me to stop, just say so.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. <em> That’s not going to happen</em>, she thought. But Rio didn’t break eye contact. “Can you do that for me?” she pressed.</p><p>“Y–yes,” Agatha stammered, squeezing her eyes shut. Fuck, if Rio didn’t hurry up and fuck her, she wouldn’t be able to control herself from coming untouched. And they couldn’t have that.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio murmured. She placed a soft kiss against the inside of Agatha’s thigh, then buried her nose against her underwear, inhaling the scent of her. Her tongue ran along her slit over the thin lace, causing Agatha’s hips to buck up wildly. “Someone’s eager,” she chuckled softly. “Christ, you’re soaking through these.”</p><p>Agatha just whimpered as her need rose. She reached down to pull at the edge of her panties, to eliminate the scrap of fabric between Rio’s mouth and her cunt, but Rio stopped her with a firm hand. “Use your words,” she instructed. </p><p>The command made her short-circuit momentarily, jaw dropped wide before she managed to speak again. “Rio, please—” she bit out. “P-please take them off. Please fuck me.” </p><p>Her underwear was bundled into Rio’s fist before she could blink. She couldn’t even remember lifting her legs to help—maybe Rio had ripped them. Either way, Agatha didn’t care. She let out a whine as Rio’s tongue made its first uninhibited swipe through her folds, gentle at first, then firmer as she began to circle her clit. </p><p>She dropped back onto the bed as Rio continued, tracing a path down to her entrance and back up again. After a few exploratory licks, Rio’s tongue honed in on her clit again, taking it into her mouth and sucking. “Jesus,” Agatha moaned, practically slamming her hips against Rio’s face. Vibrations rumbled through every inch of her body as Rio chuckled against her clit.</p><p>And oh god, she needed even more. She was already desperately close, teetering on the brink of something supremely fucking powerful, a handful of moves away from coming undone into Rio’s mouth. </p><p>And since she knew that Rio would give her anything she wanted at this point, she simply… asked for it. “Fingers,” Agatha panted, fisting the bedsheets. “Rio, now.” </p><p>Another chuckle, one that scattered shivers up her spine. Then, a low voice: “How many?”</p><p>Her eyes threatened to roll back into her head as Rio pressed a fingertip of one digit against her entrance, tongue still lapping at her clit. “Two,” she sputtered helplessly. She clenched involuntarily, deliciously, as Rio slid two fingers in up to the first knuckle, then pulled them out before thrusting them back in all the way.</p><p>“Fucking <em> hell</em>, Rio,” she cried. Lord, it wasn’t going to take her much longer. She willed the wave that was already coursing through her toes and fingertips to slow the fuck down, to give her a few more moments with Rio’s precious, perfect fingers dipping in and out of her. But then Rio curled said fingers against her G-spot alongside a particularly well-timed suck, and she was a goner.</p><p>Agatha came with a long, wanton moan while Rio’s fingers moved slowly inside her, dragging against her walls as she clenched and jerked around them. She threw her head back against the bed, breathing like she’d just run a marathon, and tried to blink herself back to life through the comedown.</p><p>That had just happened. Rio had fucked her. <em> No</em>—Rio was still fucking her, fingers pumping lazily as Agatha rode out the aftershocks of her orgasm. She whispered her name reverently, over and over again: <em> Rio, Rio, Rio</em>. </p><p>Eventually, Rio’s fingers stilled, and she lifted her head from Agatha’s pussy to look up at her. Her face was shiny with slick, a satisfied grin plastered across her face. She slowly extracted her fingers, pressing one last kiss to her pubic bone when Agatha winced at the loss. Then, she brought her fingers up to her lips, sucking the digits into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha just stared. It didn’t feel like she could do much else—she certainly wasn’t capable of forming <em> words,</em> and every part of her body was still blazing with heat as she watched Rio clean her off her fingers. Finally, as her heart rate slowed and her breath regulated, she husked out a “come here,” reaching for Rio with one hand without lifting herself upright.</p><p>Rio’s smile was softer this time, more affectionate. She gently eased Agatha’s knees closed and crawled up the bed so they were resting in the same position this had all started in, faces tilted towards each other’s. Agatha’s heart rose in her chest at the sight of her—face flushed, pupils still blown wide. She supposed she looked the same, if not much further gone.</p><p>Rio reached out first, running a hand through the lengths of Agatha’s hair. “You good?” she asked carefully.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes momentarily and huffed a disbelieving laugh. “Am I good? No, you just fucking destroyed me, Rio.” She shook her head, smiling. “I’ve never been better in my entire life.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up, all sunshine. “I’m so glad,” she whispered, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>The feeling of long, soft hair tickling her cheek roused Agatha from sleep.</p><p>She cracked one eye open and took in the scene in front of her—soft morning light slowly spilling through the blinds like it always did. The same worn leather armchair in the corner. Her favourite picture of Billy and Tommy as chubby-cheeked babies staring back at her from the dresser.</p><p>If she didn’t engage all of her senses, it was the same. The familiar bedroom she’d woken up in alone every day since Ralph had left. But there was something different now—arms wrapped around her waist. The warm press of another person’s naked body. Soft, shallow breathing that had synced to her own without warning.</p><p>Rio. Asleep in her bed. The place she’d wanted her since the tipping point a few weeks ago, when she’d masturbated thinking about her before drifting off, still thinking about her. Now, though, it was way more than a fantasy. </p><p>Memories of the night prior flooded in half-formed, mired in a strange postcoital afterglow. Agatha wasn’t sure when she’d fallen asleep; only that she had, somewhere after Rio had taken her apart with her mouth and hands but before she’d gotten to return the favour.</p><p>The imbalance prickled at her shamefully before settling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>. She should’ve gotten Rio off… she’d definitely wanted to get her off, though it had simultaneously terrified her—still did. But then Rio had gently, sweetly cleaned her up, wiping the slick from between her thighs with a washcloth. She had kissed herself off Rio’s mouth, and settled her head in that safe spot against her chest, and the next thing she knew, it was morning.</p><p>Rio wouldn’t be mad at her, she was almost certain. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t be a little mad at herself.</p><p>Maybe Rio was telepathic, because seconds later, she stirred. Her arms tightened against Agatha’s waist as she snuggled in closer, chin hooked over her shoulder.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio replied, her voice rough with sleep. She placed a kiss against Agatha’s skin before extracting a hand to check her watch. “Mm, guess I’m not going on a run,” she chuckled. </p><p>“You can still go,” Agatha offered weakly. It was a platitude—maybe a bit of an out. She held her breath, waiting to see if Rio would take it.</p><p>She just shifted and murmured, “I’m good here.”</p><p>And if the old Agatha had to guess, gun to her head, what would’ve happened the first time she woke up in another woman’s arms… well, let’s just say the rifle would’ve gone off.</p><p>Because now, instead of bolting, instead of making an excuse to leave Rio’s arms and talk herself out of the whole thing, Agatha was <em> good here</em>, too. It was a soft punch to the gut—enough to wind her, but not enough to throw her off course.</p><p>She wanted to stay.</p><p>Even if that meant having an awkward conversation about last night.</p><p>She trained her eyes on a spot on the wall in front of her, not game enough to turn to face Rio, and took a deep breath. “Last night was amazing. I’m sorry I didn’t…” she searched for words that were more morning appropriate than <em> I’m sorry I didn’t fuck you</em>. Eventually, she landed on: “Reciprocate, though. I wanted to.”</p><p>Rio’s hand found Agatha’s arm, rubbing it reassuringly. She wondered if Rio could feel the stasis in her lungs, the guilty space she was holding in her ribcage as she waited for a response.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to work like that, Agatha. Touching you made me feel really good, too.” </p><p>Agatha grappled with the base instinct to huff out a defence. It had all the makings of a white lie, though she’d never known Rio to be anything but honest.</p><p>But that wasn’t how it usually worked—or at least, it wasn’t how it had worked before. Agatha turned around in Rio’s arms and was met with an imploring expression.</p><p>“You enjoyed it?” she asked carefully.</p><p>“Yes, oh my god,” Rio breathed. “I never imagined we’d get to do that. That I’d… get to have you like that.”</p><p><em> Fuck</em>. She was too good for her. Agatha wondered what selfless deed she’d done in a past life to deserve this, and why it was all catching up to her now after years of being treated like the universe’s chew toy. </p><p>“Me either,” she sighed, relaxing into Rio’s hold a little more. “But I feel like I just left you with blue balls. Or like, a blue clit or whatever the female equivalent is.”</p><p>“I don’t know who’s made you think that before, Agatha,” Rio began. Her tone was sterner than before, though the corner of her mouth ticked up briefly at the joke. “But I’m not going to. If you’re not ready—”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha interjected, skimming a hand across Rio’s cheek. “I want to touch you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily. She grabbed Agatha’s hand from her cheek, then planted a burning kiss to her lips. “And while hearing you say that does obscene things to me… let’s not rush into a quickie before I have to go to work. How about tonight?”</p><p>Tonight. No thoughts were necessary, other than <em> fuck yes</em>. Yeah, it was still scary. Yeah, she had no clue what to do or how to do it… but she wanted this more than she’d wanted most things in her life, perhaps only second to the life growing inside her.</p><p>But now she had to wait for it. So, the universe still had its ways of messing with her. </p><p>“I wish you hadn’t picked up a Sunday shift,” Agatha grumbled. </p><p>Rio shot her a smirk that quickly dissolved into an easy smile. “It’s just a short one,” she replied. “I’ll be home by four. Got the whole evening for you.”</p><p>“That sounds nice,” Agatha nodded. “Ugh,” she groaned, burying her face in the pillow. It was all too much to handle at 7am. “Why are you so nice to me?”</p><p>“Would you prefer if I was mean to you? Because I can be,” Rio teased.</p><p>“I’d like to see you try.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. “Yeah, you’re right.”</p><p>It came so easily, laughing and joking with Rio. It was yet another thing she could add to the long list of past relationship inadequacies—to the list of things that had never felt quite like this. </p><p>“When did you know?” Agatha asked curiously, trying to keep her voice light. Her line of sight tracked down to Rio’s lips, then back up to her eyes.</p><p>“Know what?” </p><p>Agatha bit her lip and reluctantly let her doubt into the open. “That you had feelings for me.”</p><p>“Oh, <em> that</em>,” Rio chuckled. “Probably somewhere between being berated for closing the front door before 9am and making sure you didn’t die from dehydration after you barfed up the contents of your stomach.”</p><p>“Stop,” she giggled, swatting at Rio’s arm. (Alert the authorities—Agatha Harkness had clearly been abducted by aliens and body-swapped with someone who giggled.) </p><p>“I just—” Agatha shook her head. It didn’t compute—at least not this early in the day—how this seemingly perfect person had fallen into her lap without very much effort. Especially when she’d done everything in her power to keep her away. “Why me?”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio pursed her lips thoughtfully, something soft flickering behind dark eyes. </p><p>“Why not you?” she replied quietly. She traced a hand along Agatha’s side, sending goosebumps along the skin there despite the heat of the room, which wasn’t helped by the shitty air conditioning Agatha still needed to call someone to fix. </p><p>“You’re beautiful and smart. Funny. You annoy me to tears sometimes,” Rio joked, one eyebrow lifted.</p><p>The compliments made Agatha feel strangely fuzzy inside, although there was a discomfort there, too—lodged somewhere deep down. It had been a long time since someone had said things of that nature to her and meant them, in the way she hoped Rio did.</p><p>“Rio, you could have any woman your own age who isn’t riddled with baggage. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining… and I feel all of those things about you, too,” Agatha said. “But I don’t get it.”</p><p>“I don’t know, I just…” Rio shrugged lightly. “Knew there was something there. I couldn’t stop thinking about you, even when I tried not to.”</p><p>“I think I said it before, in less certain terms, when you asked me why I chose to live here. And it was true,” she continued. “It felt like fate was pushing me in your direction.” </p><p>There it was again—fate. The universe. A mystic force that neither of them could name, though Agatha had certainly tried. The ease of it made her smile, but it was small and careful.</p><p>She looked at Rio, taking everything in—the tenderness in her gaze, the softness of her fingers gently tracking their way up and down her arms, the blazing heat of their bodies pressed together. </p><p>Everything felt a little too good to be true, but Agatha could recognise her penchant for self-destruction trying to weasel its way in. So, she didn’t keep prying and picking. Instead, she just brushed a hand across Rio’s cheek again and took her at her word.</p><p>“Maybe fate’s sense of humour isn’t too bad, after all,” she murmured. “She clearly got something right.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>An hour and a cup of coffee each later, and Rio was off to work, leaving Agatha by herself in the apartment—again.</p><p>She only had two states of being at the moment—alone and questioning everything, or with Rio, trying her fucking best not to. She knew which one she preferred, though the doubt that tried to creep in every time Rio gave her a damn compliment or looked at her with those soulful, searching, ridiculously attractive eyes was almost enough to make her change her mind.</p><p>At least her own feelings were more transparent than they’d been before. What was going on in Rio’s mind was still something of a mystery, though each conversation helped to flesh it out some more. Still, it was frustrating—the tug-of-war between claiming back her control and trying to let the whole thing breathe.</p><p>As the Rio-less minutes ticked by in the apartment, Agatha grew restless. It was nothing new—she’d never handled anticipation particularly well. </p><p>She tried to busy herself—washing her sheets, remaking the bed, half-heartedly staring into the fridge for a snack—but none of it stuck. </p><p>Enough avoidance. The only thing she actually needed right now was to talk to Wanda.</p><p>“Hey, hon,” Wanda answered, her smile audible even through the crackle of Agatha’s ancient AirPods. Irritated, she pulled them out and tossed them on the kitchen counter, switching the phone over to speaker. Rio wasn’t home, so they could talk freely.</p><p>“Hi,” she replied, trying to sound chill. She <em> was </em>chill. God, no she wasn’t—she was the furthest fucking thing from chill. “How was California?”</p><p>“Good. Nothing major to report, just lots of boozing and schmoozing with middle-aged men who want to be the next Doctor Phil and don’t understand why that’s incredibly problematic.”</p><p>Agatha snorted in response, but the upturned corners of her mouth drooped quickly. She hesitated for a split second before it spilled out, too heavy to hold back. “I need to tell you something, but first, I need you to promise that you’re not going to be mad at me for keeping it from you, or that you’re going to say I told you so.”</p><p>After a beat of stunned silence, Wanda replied. “Cross my heart,” she said, voice gentle.</p><p>“I kissed Rio.”</p><p>Agatha heard a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line. “Oh my god, it actually happened,” Wanda muttered in amazement.</p><p>It was the reaction she’d expected, to some degree. Last time they’d spoken, she’d been unsure. The attraction bomb had been dropped, but her feelings for Rio were still buried.</p><p>Since then, she’d picked them from the rubble and started to polish them, to figure out what they could be. Agatha had known she needed to do it herself, without leaning on her best friend and her seemingly infinite wisdom—and miraculously, she had.</p><p>Still, she supposed she owed her the full update. “There’s more,” Agatha sighed. She rubbed her temple, the honesty prompting a sudden headache. “We went on a date. And we’ve been doing… couple-y things.”</p><p>“Wow,” Wanda breathed, like she couldn’t believe it. “A lot can happen in a week, huh? Have you…”</p><p>“Slept together?” Agatha made a soft noise of affirmation. “Last night.”</p><p>“Holy <em> shit</em>. How was it?”</p><p>“Amazing,” Agatha admitted. “Like, the best sex of my life by a mile. Hands down, no competition, blue ribbon-worthy sex.” Saying the words out loud made her feel a little sad—a quiet mourning for all the years she’d lost to having sex with people she didn’t even care about. People she just put up with despite their many misgivings.</p><p>Wanda chuckled quietly, but didn’t comment on the lesbian realisation of it all. Agatha was supremely grateful. “Were you nervous?”</p><p>“Not really,” she said. “We took a nap together, and it just kind of happened when we woke up. She…” Agatha paused as a flicker of shame rose again. “She took care of me, but then I passed out. Totally left her hanging.”</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be quid pro quo, you know,” Wanda noted.</p><p>“I know that,” she grumbled, before correcting herself in a slightly more forgiving tone. “Now. But I wanted to. I still want to, I’m just… I’m getting way too in my head now that I know it’s coming, and I’m scared I’m going to freeze up or have no idea what to do.”</p><p>“You’ll be fine,” Wanda replied gently. “Rio doesn’t seem the type to make you feel shit about not fucking her properly. She’s not Ralph, Agatha.” </p><p>“That’s the fucking problem, Wanda,” she groaned, the realisation hitting her all at once. “I knew what to expect with Ralph. He was simple. I didn’t… feel things the way I do with her.”</p><p>Agatha pulled out a stool from underneath the kitchen island and slumped on it as she continued. “Now I’m someone I don’t even recognise, and it’s all her fucking fault. We woke up cuddling this morning. <em> Cuddling</em>. In my bed.”</p><p>“I don’t—” she sighed, clenching her jaw. “I don’t remember the last time I did that with someone and didn’t immediately want to run or punch them in the face.”</p><p>Wanda hummed knowingly. “She makes you feel safe. That’s new for you.”</p><p>Agatha had thought the same thing about a million times since things had changed between her and Rio. But hearing it from Wanda, out in the open like this, was vastly different. Like someone else seeing it made it more certain—and more likely to break.</p><p>“I can’t help but think it’s all going to come crashing down when she realises that being with me involves a kid. A fucking <em> newborn</em>,” Agatha bit out quietly. She looked down at her hand where it laid on the countertop, and realised she’d begun to draw tight, anxious circles over the marble.</p><p>“You don’t think she’s already figured that out?”</p><p>“I don’t know. We don’t talk about it.” </p><p>“Then maybe you should?” Wanda said quizzically. </p><p>“But— how do I even initiate that? I’m so bad at all this feelings stuff. And I don’t want to freak her out.”</p><p>“Honey, you’re not giving yourself enough credit. I’ve been gone for less than two weeks and you managed to figure out what you were feeling, kiss her, and start dating without calling me once. You’re navigating this just fine on your own.”</p><p>“I’ve just never been so scared of messing something up, before,” Agatha admitted.</p><p>“Well, falling in love is scary.”</p><p><em> Oh, no, no, no</em>. That wasn’t what this was. She wasn’t ready for <em> that </em>particular blow, not now. They were still miles off feelings of that magnitude, if they ever even came—there was so much more to talk about, so much about Rio she wanted to understand. </p><p>So much about herself she wanted to understand, too, in the context of the new and downright perplexing thing between them. About what she wanted, now that her predictable life plan had the potential to include another person. </p><p>“No one said anything about love, Wanda,” she snapped. “Don’t. It’s far too early for that.” </p><p>“Okay, point taken,” Wanda said, sidestepping her shutdown nimbly. “Back to the sex part. You gonna go there tonight?”</p><p>Thank fuck for segues—while it still made her stomach stutter with nerves, sex talk was a reprieve. “Yeah, I think so,” she said.</p><p>Wanda tittered on the end of the line, her voice echoing through the kitchen. “Oh my god, you have to call me when the deed is done.”</p><p>“That’s so fucking weird, Wanda.”</p><p>“You called me after you masturbated,” Wanda chuckled. “And you watched me push two babies out of my vagina. Nothing is weird anymore.”</p><p>“I will <em> text </em> you in the <em> morning</em>,” Agatha compromised, her emphasis making the distinction clear. </p><p>“I’ll be waiting by the phone,” Wanda chirped. “Like, ringtone on full volume.”</p><p>“God forbid you curb your boredom by watching reality TV like the rest of us.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I deserve a little entertainment after everything you’ve put me through.” </p><p>Agatha made a disgruntled sound. Perhaps she was right, but she didn’t deserve the satisfaction. Come to think of it, now felt like a pretty good time to hang up.</p><p>Before she could brush her off and pivot to another means of distraction, though, Wanda spoke. “Hey,” she said. “I’m happy for you, Agatha. Let yourself be happy for you, too.” </p><p>She hummed out a deflective <em> okay,</em> then a friendlier <em> bye</em>. But she didn’t shift from her position at the kitchen island, instead staring down at her phone long after she’d hung up.</p><p>Wanda’s words replayed in her head like a broken record—<em> let yourself be happy</em>. It was easier said than done, but god, she was trying. All she could do for now was put one foot in front of the other, and hope that Rio would still be beside her every step of the way.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>A couple minutes past 4pm, Agatha felt her lungs expand again as Rio walked through the front door. She tried to act normal, offering pleasantries and a quick kiss before Rio headed to her room to clean up from the day. Her work uniform was covered in smudges of dirt, hair messy and escaping from its clip.</p><p>Agatha waited on the couch while Rio showered. God, dating the person you lived with was weird. One minute you were fucking, the next you were trying to go about your daily life while they went about theirs… all before you fucked again.</p><p>An episode and a half of a shitty sitcom Agatha could barely pay attention to later, Rio reemerged. What had taken her so long, she didn’t know—she was dressed simply in a black t-shirt and a pair of loose shorts, feet bare and hair damp.</p><p>“Hey there,” Rio smiled, ambling over to the couch and plopping herself beside Agatha.</p><p>“Hi again,” Agatha replied, angling herself to face Rio. She grabbed the TV remote from where it had fallen between the couch cushions and turned it off. “How was your day?”</p><p>“Okay,” she sighed, a tired smile on her face. “Got my results from that paper you helped me with while I was at work. Why they have to send shit on a fucking weekend, I’ll never know.”</p><p>Agatha had almost forgotten about Rio’s paper, the one she’d edited the night before everything changed. She searched her eyes for a hint at the end result, but found none. “So… how’d you do?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a grin. “I got an A,” she confirmed. “Thanks to you, I can only assume.” </p><p>A rush of warmth flooded Agatha’s face. She reached for Rio’s hand and gave it a squeeze. “That’s amazing,” she encouraged. “But it was all you. The second paper was so good. All I did was polish it a little.”</p><p>“You made it better. Thank you,” Rio said, before planting a soft peck on her lips. “Anyway, how was <em> your </em> day?”</p><p>She pondered honesty, but saying <em> I didn’t know what to do with myself while you were gone </em>felt just a smidge too desperate this early on. “It was fine,” she lied. “Just did a few things around the house, tried to write. Didn’t get very far.”</p><p>“Too distracted waiting for this afternoon?” Rio asked teasingly.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip—god, lying used to come so easily. Now Rio saw through her like she was a pane of goddamn glass. “A little bit,” she acknowledged, looking down at her lap. “Rio, I’m… nervous.”</p><p>“Don’t be,” Rio encouraged quietly. Her fingers rubbed soothingly over Agatha’s hand. “It’ll be great.”</p><p>“What if I can’t make you come?” Agatha asked, in a voice that sounded far too small and forlorn to be her own.</p><p>“Somehow, I don’t think that’s going to be a problem,” Rio pondered, her eyes tracking across Agatha’s form. Amidst all the waiting, she’d put a little more effort in, throwing on jeans and a tank and fixing her hair so it cascaded wildly down her back. “But it’s not the end goal.” </p><p>It helped a bit, hearing that—but it didn’t ease all of the mounting pressure Agatha felt. “You shouldn’t have to orchestrate your own pleasure just because I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing,” she sighed.</p><p>“Who says?” Rio shrugged. Agatha levelled her with a withering glare.</p><p>“No, I’m serious,” Rio continued easily. “I want you to feel comfortable. And you want to learn how to make me feel good—right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Of course I do.”</p><p>“Then what’s wrong with a little… choreography?”</p><p>“Nothing, I guess,” she mumbled. “It’s just not as hot when we plan it all out.”</p><p>“Well, I happen to think that planning it out,” Rio leaned in to whisper in Agatha’s ear, “talking you through it while you touch me,” she said, pressing a kiss to her jaw, “telling you how good you are when you make me come—because you <em> will </em>make me come—can be very, very hot.”</p><p>Agatha shivered, unable to school her reaction to the words she needed to hear. The confidence she needed to do this, without having to be perfect. Rio’s voice in her ear, low and sultry, only hammered it home. </p><p>“And just because I’m the one teaching you,” Rio continued, “that doesn’t mean you don’t get a say in how, Agatha.” She planted both hands on Agatha’s waist. “If you want to be in control… you can be.”</p><p>“Rio, I don’t know how—”</p><p>Rio pressed a thumb to her lips, shushing her. “Don’t think about trying to recreate lesbian porn. We can just do what’s comfortable for you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, steeling herself. This shouldn’t be so hard—it had never been hard before. But it had also never been <em> Rio </em>before. She hated it a little, but it was undeniable. It meant more.</p><p>Regardless of her mounting fear, though, she was desperate to get her hands on Rio—some way, somehow, and as soon as humanly possible. So, that’s what she was going to do. Now. </p><p>She led Rio from the couch to her bedroom by the hand, then closed the door behind them. Even though they were the only ones in the apartment, it felt better that way—their own private moment.</p><p>Agatha stopped at the foot of the bed, Rio next to her. Inhaling sharply, she looked up into deep brown eyes that were full of care.</p><p>Rio unhooked their hands and curled her arms around Agatha’s waist. “What do you want to do?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“I want to kiss you,” she breathed, eyes flicking down to Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Well, don’t let me stop you,” Rio murmured, but she didn’t lean in.</p><p>Agatha realised she’d have to make the first move. Thankfully, kissing Rio was something she’d done before—that she was good at, even. It had only been a week since their lips had first met, but they were familiar territory, already charted ground.</p><p>She leaned in, closing the inch of space between them, and cupped Rio’s face with one hand. Her thumb stroked along tanned, unblemished skin before she seized her lips in a kiss.</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, Rio’s hands drawing gentle circles against her waist while Agatha controlled the kiss, mapping out even more of Rio’s mouth with her own. She bit down on one perfect, pillowy lip and it made Rio gasp. It created the perfect opening to deepen the kiss, so she did, involving their tongues and teeth until it felt like they were trying to eat each other whole.</p><p>Eventually Agatha pulled back, hyper-aware of her swollen lips and growing desire to move things along. She could only imagine Rio felt the same, if her already rapid breathing was anything to go by. “Can I take this off?” Agatha asked, lifting a corner of Rio’s t-shirt.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hand along Rio’s abs, taking the t-shirt with her, and nearly had a heart attack once it exposed her chest. Gone was yesterday’s simple white bralette, and in its place was a dark green lace bra, sheer with embroidered flowers. She couldn’t stop her jaw as it dropped.</p><p>“Surprise,” Rio smirked. “Thought I’d give my boobs girl a little treat.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha rolled her eyes, before training them back on the perfect, lace-cloaked tits in front of her. “You’re a menace.” </p><p>“Wait ‘til you see the rest,” Rio shrugged nonchalantly, gaze flicking down to her shorts.</p><p>And if this was Agatha’s turn, her opportunity to do whatever the fuck she wanted to Rio, then she supposed she better take it. She brushed two thumbs against Rio’s nipples through the fabric of the bra, drawing in a sharp breath as they turned hard under her touch. Then, she slid her hands along Rio’s waist to the band of her shorts. </p><p>A few swift motions later, they were pooled on the floor and she was staring open-mouthed at another swath of forest green, the waistband low on Rio’s hips.</p><p>The sight of Rio’s barely clothed pussy drew a primal growl from her throat. It was definitely a thong, a theory she confirmed seconds later when she reached around to palm Rio’s ass and met nothing but warm, rounded skin. </p><p>“A little harder,” Rio encouraged breathily. </p><p>Agatha dug her nails in, scraping against bare flesh and drawing their bodies closer. “Better?”</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>Maybe this wouldn’t be as difficult as Agatha had expected. She knew what she wanted to do next, and it involved slowly unwrapping Rio like a present.</p><p>Agatha trailed her hands up Rio’s back to unclasp her bra, then freed it, letting it drop to the floor. There were those tits again in all their glory, and that tattoo, practically begging to be shiny and slick with Agatha’s spit. </p><p>She fixed two hands against Rio’s waist and dipped her head, running her tongue from where the tattoo started between her breasts, down along firm abs until she reached her bellybutton. The waistband of Rio’s panties was so, so close, and Agatha wondered if she had the wherewithal to wait until they were on a comfy surface to touch her, or if her desire would get the better of her here and now.</p><p>Still, kneeling on hardwoods without some kind of protective barrier didn’t exactly scream <em> stamina</em>.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to Rio’s stomach and watched her eyes turn dark. “Lie down,” she husked out, using her hold on Rio’s waist to turn her towards the bed.</p><p>Rio obliged, falling back against the sheets. While she got comfortable, Agatha shucked her jeans, then grabbed a cushion from the armchair in the corner of her room, placing it under herself to kneel on the floor.</p><p>She looked up at Rio, who gave her a tiny nod of encouragement, one brow lifted. She was still wearing the thong, but Agatha could smell her arousal from her vantage point—sweet and heady.</p><p>Rio had worked her up a little through her panties yesterday, but <em> god,</em> as much as it scared her, Agatha needed to get up close and personal with Rio’s cunt. She tugged at the edges of the underwear and dragged them down Rio’s legs, careful not to rip the fabric—because this couldn’t be the only time she saw Rio in this particular set of lingerie.</p><p>Once they were off, Rio spread her legs wider, giving her an unadulterated view of glistening pink folds. Agatha swallowed thickly as she took it all in, from the soft skin of her inner thighs to the neatly trimmed hair that trailed from mound to entrance. </p><p>She stilled, suddenly paralysed. Her eyes flicked up to Rio again, who leaned up to look down at her. Her face was flushed, pupils growing bigger by the minute.</p><p>“Show me what to do,” Agatha said, volume barely above a whisper.</p><p>Rio nodded. A gentle smile crossed her face as she reached down between her own legs and held out a hand for Agatha to take. Agatha gripped it like a lifeline and let her fingers be led to Rio’s entrance.</p><p>“Holy shit, Rio,” Agatha breathed, feeling the wetness coat her fingers instantly. She pried Rio’s hand from hers and gave into the exploration, dipping a finger inside her slowly to collect more of her slick. </p><p>Agatha could feel her pulse hammering in more places than one; most importantly, between her own legs. A string of Rio’s arousal ran from one finger to the other, and it made her mouth go dry. “Is it weird that I’m extremely turned on by how wet you are?”</p><p>“Not weird,” Rio replied slowly, like she could barely get out more than a few words at a time. “Very hot. Please—” she stuttered out, grabbing a hold of Agatha’s wrist again to guide her up to her clit. </p><p>“Okay.” She got the memo immediately—Rio needed more. And she was going to give it to her, even if it meant figuring out what she was doing along the way. </p><p>Agatha began to trace slow circles around Rio’s clit, touching the way she liked to be touched herself. Rio’s hand stayed clamped around her wrist for a few seconds longer, directing the movements, before falling away to brace herself against the bed.</p><p>“That’s it,” Rio breathed, her hips chasing Agatha’s touch. “You’re doing so good.” </p><p>The praise lit a fire inside of her, and suddenly, this was all there was—a beautiful woman laid out in front of her, ready and waiting and begging for her touch. She kept circling Rio’s clit, using her other hand to grip tightly at Rio’s thigh. </p><p>With every little noise Rio made, every soft moan and pleased exhale, Agatha felt the tension inside of herself dissipate. In its place, something else was building, throbbing low between her own legs. <em> Christ</em>, she was an idiot for ever questioning whether she’d like this, whether she’d be capable of doing it. Now all she wanted to know was how much further she could take it. </p><p>“Can I… put my mouth on you?” she asked slowly, desperately hoping Rio would agree.</p><p>“Do you want to?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, so vehemently it felt frantic, her head bobbing up and down on its own. </p><p>“Then god, yes,” Rio replied hungrily, eyes flicking down to meet hers.</p><p>She didn’t dive right in, instead latching her mouth to the soft skin of Rio’s inner thigh. She pressed kisses against every inch of her, spending enough time at each site to leave a mark. The idea of seeing Rio’s thighs littered with the remnants of her tomorrow sent a spark through her body. </p><p>Though Agatha’s fingers had barely slowed against her clit, Rio began to writhe, soft moans turning into whimpers. “Agatha, p–please,” she said, her voice breaking with urgency. “I need your mouth, now. N–need you to taste me.”</p><p>“I’m coming, sweetheart,” she acknowledged, finally removing her hand to draw Rio in by her thighs. She positioned her mouth close to Rio’s clit, trying hard not to stare at how fucking soaked and swollen she was, and—“ugh,” Agatha exhaled, blowing a strand of hair away from her face. “I need a hair tie.” </p><p>“Noooo,” Rio groaned, pouting. She shifted uncomfortably on the bed, rocking her hips against nothing. “Leave it down.”</p><p>“Rio, I’m not getting your come in my fucking hair,” Agatha scoffed. Her mouth was still insanely close to Rio’s pussy, but that wouldn’t stop her from being difficult, if only for a second. “I just washed it.”</p><p>“Let me hold it, then,” Rio smirked down at her, reaching out an eager hand. Agatha noted Rio’s pleased expression and rolled her eyes as firm fingers smoothed the hair out of her face, collecting it tightly at the nape of her neck.</p><p>Agatha laughed, a low, quiet chuckle. “Show me where you want me,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio needed no instruction—clearly she was as committed to being as excellent a teacher as Agatha was a good student. She tilted Agatha’s head closer to her cunt using the hold on her hair, shifting her own hips simultaneously so they were flush, Agatha’s face pressed right up against her clit. </p><p>Rio moaned immediately at the renewed contact, and Agatha couldn’t help but let out an equally as satisfied noise of her own as Rio’s slick quickly dampened her face from nose to chin. <em> Jesus</em>, she was fucking dripping—it spurred a silent challenge inside her, to see how much wetter she could make Rio while she fucked her. If she did it right, maybe she’d have to change the bedsheets again.</p><p>Leaning into the grip on the back of her head, Agatha darted her tongue out to lick around Rio’s clit, stroking tenderly either side of it before switching to rapid, firm flicks. With Rio controlling her every movement, pressing her firmer and firmer against her cunt, she couldn’t look up to gauge her reaction—but her other senses were more than enough. </p><p>As she licked and sucked, she heard the moans slip from Rio’s mouth. <em> Keep going</em>. <em> Perfect</em>. <em> Right there, fuck, yes—right there, Agatha</em>. </p><p>When she took Rio’s clit into her mouth, grazing against it lightly with her teeth, she smelled and tasted it at once—the way Rio’s scent only got stronger and more intoxicating as the wetness leaked out of her, painting Agatha’s cheeks and chin.</p><p>And as she hooked one hand around Rio’s leg to bring it over her shoulder, before sliding two fingers into her entrance—slow at first, learning Rio’s movements until she clenched around her like a vice—she felt <em> everything</em>. Rio pressing and pulling her in so deliciously that Agatha was pretty sure she was minutes away from coming, just from giving head. The way she slammed her free hand so hard into the mattress to anchor herself. How her hold eventually loosened around Agatha’s hair, both of them too focused on the divine pleasure of it all to care.</p><p>And finally, the clenching of Rio’s pussy around her fingers and her thighs around her head, gripping everything tightly in place as her orgasm began to hit. Agatha thrust her fingers gently in and out around the tightness, helping her ride it out while she suckled at her clit. </p><p>Rio babbled nonsensically as she came, a string of expletives and moans and best of all, <em> Agatha</em>, over and over again. <em> Fuck</em>, she sounded incredible. It was confirmation that Agatha had done what she’d set out to do—not just getting Rio to her peak, but pushing past all the worry and self-doubt from earlier that day.</p><p>Jesus, it made so much sense now. How easily Rio had reassured her that morning—she hadn’t been telling a lie; <em> no</em>, it had been nothing but the fucking truth. Being brought to the brink by Rio’s long, skilled fingers and plush mouth was one thing, but this? This might be better. With a little practice, it <em> definitely </em>would be.</p><p>Agatha felt… powerful. In control, just like Rio had promised. And amidst the chaos of the last few months, it was exactly what she needed—the sight of Rio coming undone, the music of her beautiful, breathy moans, all because of her.</p><p>It was <em> everything</em>. It <em> meant </em> everything.</p><p>Agatha was still kneeling on the floor by Rio’s open legs, her cunt on full display, come dripping onto the bedsheets. Rio propped herself up on her elbows and stared at her, eyes wide and lips parted. </p><p>“How’d I do?” Agatha asked. She’d meant for it to come out blithe, tried to encase it in a chuckle, but it caught in her throat.</p><p>“You did so good, baby,” Rio breathed, sounding spent. Her eyes were so, so dark—nothing but pupils swimming in a sea of white. The sight of her was something to behold, but Agatha couldn’t focus on anything but Rio’s words seeping through her skin.</p><p>Did she just—had Rio just called her <em> baby</em>?</p><p><em> Baby </em> wasn’t just dating, or fucking. <em> Baby </em> was the stuff of relationships, Agatha was sure of it. She’d always resisted pet names unless they were used ironically or in place of a threat. A <em> sweetheart </em> laced with ire always landed much better than <em> motherfucker</em>. Ralph had answered only to his name, nothing more than a well-trained dog, and she’d liked it that way.</p><p>But the sound of <em> baby </em> from Rio’s lips as she came down from her high was solid gold, and the sight of sun breaking through the clouds, and yet another fucking gut punch all at once. Agatha felt it echo through her, hot and aching.</p><p><em> Oh, no</em>—she was in deep.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Once Rio had recovered the full use of her limbs, they edged their way up the bed in tandem, Rio propped up against the headboard lazily while Agatha leant her head on her stomach. She loved it, they way they fell so easily together—not just after sex, but all the time. </p><p>Rio had a hold on her, that much she would admit, and it only became stronger every day.</p><p>After a few minutes of lying there, Agatha made a move to get up. She probably needed to shower, though everything was still heavy and hazy, especially after what Rio had just said.</p><p>Rio, however, wasn’t having it. “Ah-ah,” she shook her head, pulling Agatha back down by her tank top. “I’m not done with you. I think you deserve a reward.”</p><p>“Do I?” Agatha asked. She wasn’t going to dispute it—her own thighs were still sticky from the adrenaline rush of making Rio come, of making her fall apart beneath her mouth and hands.</p><p>“Mmm-hmm. Come,” Rio commanded, tapping the side of her face. Agatha frowned and crawled up the bed, kneeling beside Rio to plant a kiss on her cheek.</p><p>Rio chuckled and fixed Agatha with a hungry gaze. “Cute, but not what I want.” She ran her hand down Agatha’s back teasingly and cupped the back of her thigh, fingers ghosting the curve of her ass. Agatha yelped quietly as Rio squeezed.</p><p>Her hand moved from one ass cheek to rest against Agatha’s cunt teasingly, over the underwear she hadn’t yet taken off. “Up here,” she beckoned again, licking her lips.</p><p>“You want me to…” Agatha trailed off. Surely Rio wasn’t insinuating what Agatha thought she was. The thought sent a tiny thrill through her, triggering more wetness between her thighs—but it also set off alarm bells.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio confirmed easily. She tucked her tongue into her cheek. “Let me give that pretty pussy of yours the attention it deserves.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned at the compliment, and at the barest hint of dirty talk. Fuck, everything they’d done until now was just the tip of the iceberg with this woman, she was certain. </p><p>Still, Agatha shook her head embarrassedly. “I’ve never…” </p><p>“There’s a first time for everything,” Rio teased.</p><p>Yeah, but the first time for <em> this </em> probably shouldn’t be at 17 weeks pregnant. You know, logically. It was simple physics. “Rio, I’m getting heavier,” she protested, gesturing to her stomach.</p><p>“Shush, you’re fine.” Rio’s hand was still between her legs, a thumb and finger skirting beneath her underwear to toy lightly with her clit. Agatha whimpered softly and knew that her curiosity and desire were about to win out—that no amount of trying to talk herself nor Rio out of it would work.</p><p>She hesitated one last time, her body saying <em> yes </em> even as her brain whispered <em> maybe</em>. But the want in Rio’s eyes, the way she waited—no rush, just an open invitation—made the decision easier.</p><p>Agatha gently removed Rio’s hand from her underwear and swung one leg over her body so she was hovering above Rio’s chest. Rio’s lazy smile immediately transformed into a self-satisfied grin as she cottoned on—she was getting her wish.</p><p>“You can put your weight on me,” Rio reassured her, reaching both hands around to grab Agatha’s ass and pull her towards her mouth. Agatha shifted forwards and latched onto the headboard of the bed, easing a little closer to Rio. As she looked down, the slight protrusion of her belly stared back up at her, obscuring most of Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio nudged her nose against the lace of Agatha’s underwear, then licked a torturous stripe along her entrance over the fabric. Agatha’s hips bucked in response as Rio hummed against her. “Christ, Agatha,” she murmured, her voice coming out muffled. “Have you been like this the whole time?”</p><p>“Mm-hmm,” Agatha nodded, clamping her eyes shut. “So wet for you,” she panted. “I never thought—” she paused, struggling to catch her breath as a ripple of pleasure coursed through her, “I never thought making someone else come would feel that good.” </p><p>Rio didn’t respond with words—not that she could, with her head wedged firmly between Agatha’s thighs, applying open-mouthed kisses to her cunt until her underwear was nothing more than a wet scrap. She just moaned, so loud and guttural that it vibrated through every fucking fibre of Agatha’s being, then ripped Agatha’s underwear clean off her, tossing them carelessly on the bed. </p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped, desire spooling inside her. “Those were nice panties, you asshole,” she grumbled, but her ire was quickly forgotten when Rio reached a hand up to pinch one nipple under her tank top, raking her tongue through her folds at the same time.</p><p>“Jesus, <em> fuck</em>,” she muttered, fingers clenching against the headboard. The image of what it would be like to ride something other than Rio’s face filled her mind as she rocked her hips down, chasing the friction. Rio responded in kind, slotting her tongue deep inside of her and causing her nose to bump against her clit. </p><p><em> That </em>was enough to make Agatha howl, throwing her head back and grabbing wildly at Rio’s thighs once she lost purchase against the bed. “Oh my god, Rio,” she stammered as Rio set a steady pace, thrusting her tongue out of her, then back in again and again, nose nudging against her clit with every re-entry. </p><p>The words kept pouring out of Agatha as Rio ate her pussy, more vocal than she’d ever been before: “Holy fucking <em> shit</em>, yes, Rio, keep going, you’re perfect. I’m gonna—” she breathed heavily, her muscles tightening around Rio’s eager tongue. Rio dug her nails into her breast and ass, gripping at both sensitive sites to hold her upright,  bracing for what came next. </p><p>It didn’t take long. “I’m gonna come, <em> baby</em>, I’m—” Agatha whined, before losing all ability to form real words and tapering off into a record-breakingly loud moan. Her orgasm tore through her entire body, turning her vision black, though she wasn’t sure if Rio had fucked her so hard she’d momentarily lost sight or if she’d just squeezed her eyes shut without even realising. </p><p>Amidst the unending shocks of pleasure that threatened to dismantle her, Rio removed her tongue and swiped it up the length of her slit, tasting her painstakingly. Eventually, her lips settled around Agatha’s clit, now raw and exposed, and sucked at it gently while she came down. Her hands had relaxed, nails no longer scattering marks across her skin, but they stayed in place, rubbing slow circles against a breast and asscheek.</p><p>Once the aftershocks had finally ebbed away, Agatha felt like she was waking up from a dream. Somewhere between Rio ripping her panties off and feeling the perfect press of a tongue to her entrance, she had let go completely, her body melding into Rio’s without hesitation. </p><p>She was surprised Rio hadn’t suffocated under there, mainly from a sheer lack of oxygen. The woman was fucking superhuman, Agatha decided, as she lifted herself off Rio gingerly and curled into her side. Her tank top was still bunched up to expose her tits, but she left it like that, revelling in the heat of skin on skin.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and saw the smirk she’d already come to associate with Rio getting her off, the one that said <em> I know what I just did to you</em>. Her entire face, from nose to chin, was soaking wet—though Rio didn’t seem to mind, instead focused on catching her breath from a good five minutes spent immersed in Agatha’s cunt.</p><p><em>Fuck</em> <em>it</em>, Agatha thought, leaning over and crashing her lips into Rio’s, slipping her tongue in to explore every crevice of her mouth.</p><p>“Like the way you taste?” Rio drawled, once they’d broken apart. “You’re fucking delicious.”</p><p>“Mmm.” She smiled, skimming a hand over Rio’s bare chest. “Good, but you taste better.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Both of them came once more—first Rio, with Agatha’s fingers buried inside her, then Agatha, undone again on Rio’s tongue—before they decided to call it a night. They were covered in sweat and arousal, but after two orgasms, Agatha didn’t give a fuck about showering anymore. Feeling the exhaustion in every inch of her body, she rose from the bed and grabbed two t-shirts from her dresser drawer, handing one to Rio.</p><p>“Westview High School, Class of 2001,” Rio read the back of the shirt aloud before easing her way into it.</p><p>“Do <em> not </em> tell me how old you were in 2001,” Agatha warned. She slipped her own t-shirt over her head and settled back next to Rio, pulling the sheet around them.</p><p>To her credit, Rio stayed silent, though Agatha was perfectly capable of doing her own mental math. Instead, Rio just leaned into her chest and chuckled softly, her laugh scattering across Agatha’s skin as she carefully draped an arm over her middle.</p><p>Agatha guessed they were cuddling again tonight, albeit in a different position than usual. And they did. Rio slipped into sleep first, breathing quietly while Agatha scratched her nails across her scalp gently. </p><p>It took her a while longer, but Agatha eventually followed suit, the weight of all the fucking—and all the fucking feelings—winning out. </p><p>No more than two hours later, Agatha was awoken by a strange twitching sensation in her abdomen. She blearily looked down to see if it was Rio unconsciously brushing her hand across her stomach while she slept, but it had moved and now dangled by Agatha’s legs.</p><p>And if it wasn’t Rio… then there was only one other explanation. </p><p>“Holy <em> shit</em>,” Agatha breathed, resting a hand against her belly. She let it still there, waiting for confirmation. A few minutes later, it came—no more than a soft flutter, like the first drops of rain on a window.</p><p>Instinctively, she curled a hand around Rio’s arm. She roused a little, her legs shifting against Agatha’s. “You okay?” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“Give me your hand,” she whispered, holding hers out for Rio to take. The dim glow of the city lights outside the bedroom window provided enough illumination for Agatha to take in the confused look on Rio’s face as she blinked the sleep out of her eyes. </p><p>Agatha grasped her fingers and placed them gently on her stomach. Another flutter, minuscule but undeniably there, or so she thought. “Did you feel that?”</p><p>She watched for a shadow of recognition to cross Rio’s features, but she just looked up at her, brown eyes soft and waiting. “Not really,” Rio admitted.</p><p>“Hang on a second,” she said reassuringly, pressing her body closer to Rio’s. It would happen again; it had to. She felt tears pricking at her eyes, unbidden but not unwelcome, as the realisation washed over her—her baby was moving. It was in there, still as tiny as a pomegranate, but well on its way to becoming a fully actualised human being. </p><p>Agatha felt the same way she had during the ultrasound, bursting with the hope of it all, though a little anxious about letting it in. She tore her gaze from her t-shirt-clad stomach and let it fall on Rio once more. </p><p>And Rio looked… hesitant. Uncertain, but Agatha couldn’t parse why. Maybe it was because she couldn’t feel it—Agatha knew that was a possibility, that the likelihood of Rio feeling a kick or a flutter or <em> whatever </em>this was wasn’t particularly high this early in her pregnancy. </p><p>She prayed there was no other reason.</p><p>Rio yawned, her fingers flexing against Agatha’s stomach. Her touch was only featherlight, but her hand didn’t wander back to her side, either—it just rested there tentatively, like she was too scared to move. “I still can’t feel it,” she said, with the tenderness and sincerity of an apology. “Is… is the baby moving?”</p><p>“Yeah, I think so,” Agatha nodded, unable to stop the small, sad smile from gracing her lips. “But it’s gone now.” She turned to place a kiss against Rio’s head, still half-buried in her chest. “Go back to sleep,” she murmured quietly.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio agreed, her eyes fluttering closed at the command. But her hand still grazed over the curve of Agatha’s belly, the touch a little more deliberate than before.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After being roused by the twitching in her stomach, Agatha laid awake, letting the rhythmic whir of the ceiling fan and Rio’s calm, quiet breathing recenter her.</p><p>For a moment there, it had been like she was floating—that euphoric, cloud-nine kind of feeling people wrote about in books and love songs. The little life inside of her had moved, and everything else had stopped, and she’d been overcome by an odd sense of… peace. A feeling she’d rarely experienced in her life, and definitely not amongst the craziness of the last few months.</p><p>But it had disappeared once she’d seen Rio’s face. Even in the darkness of her unlit bedroom, it was clearly reluctant—brown eyes laced with enough doubt to make her skin prickle.</p><p>She’d contemplated waking her up again to hash it out, but she’d looked so calm in sleep, her body curled snugly into Agatha’s own. Plus, she didn’t even know what to ask, or how to ask it.</p><p><em> Are you nervous about this baby? </em>Too vague—anyone would be nervous about dating someone who was about to have a kid.</p><p><em> Is this getting too real for you? </em>Fuck, no. That’d just be illuminating the exit signs on Rio’s behalf.</p><p>Worse: <em> Have you ever thought about having kids? And what does me having one mean for us? </em></p><p>None of them felt right. Maybe it was the moment holding her back, or just semantics—Agatha wasn’t sure. So, until she understood it better herself, Rio would have to remain unaware of the conflict in Agatha’s mind; of the way it settled uncomfortably in her body. Of how she was trying her fucking best to not tear everything apart.</p><p>It wasn’t lost on her, how goddamn infuriatingly <em> mature </em> she was being. The Harkness MO had been, for as long as she could remember, to ruin a good thing before it had the chance to ruin her. Her past was littered with the evidence—failed relationships, abandoned friendships, jobs she’d sabotaged before figuring out her path.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t <em> want </em> to ruin this particular thing. Old habits were telling her to light the match, but the new, cautiously optimistic, slightly more sane Agatha was blowing out the flame before it could spark. This version of her could recognise, albeit begrudgingly, that if she wanted her relationship with Rio to work, jumping to conclusions based on a fleeting look wasn’t the best idea.</p><p>The rest of the early morning hours were spent warring with the blackness behind her eyeballs, willing herself to rest while her mind pursued other plans. The flutters didn’t return, so the kid was clearly done for the night—or maybe they knew how much turmoil they’d already caused, illuminating a tiny crack between her and Rio she hadn’t realised was there.</p><p>At 6am, Agatha’s entire body went cold. She held her breath like she was underwater, trying to stay still as Rio shifted restlessly beside her. The crack only widened when Rio gently eased out of her embrace and tiptoed out of the room.</p><p>Agatha heard the door to her bedroom swing open, then closed, followed a few minutes later by the irritating sound of the apartment’s front door shutting. It hadn’t bothered her for weeks, but this morning it reverberated against every corner of her brain, so unapologetic in its volume that it felt like a personal attack.</p><p>With the sun already streaming through the windows, there was little to no chance of getting any more sleep. She wriggled around, irrationally annoyed by the cool sheets and the lack of Rio’s furnace-like presence pressed up against her like a barnacle.</p><p>She resented it. Not the noise of the door, or the routine breaking of day, but the way that Rio leaving her in an empty bed could hollow her out in seconds.</p><p>Especially when the only thing she could do, at least until Rio returned—until she figured out exactly how to table the conversation that was gnawing at her insides—was pretend like everything was fine.</p><p>Stretching, Agatha rolled out of bed and dragged her limp, exhausted frame into the kitchen. The coffee maker snarled at her at this ungodly hour, but she coaxed it into compliance, tinkering with the buttons until it was spitting out steaming hot liquid. Once her coffee had been poured and downed in a short series of gulps, Agatha moved around the apartment with brisk determination.</p><p>She resolved not to let this wreck her—no, that would be pathetic. Rio had probably just been half-asleep, or she’d read her expression wrong. And then she’d left for a run, like she did most mornings. Fuck if she was going to spiral over something as inconsequential as this.</p><p>That is, unless Rio gave her a reason to. She wondered absentmindedly if she ever would. Rio had proven herself to be the most easygoing person on the fucking earth, not one to pick a fight or initiate conflict. But maybe it had been playing on her mind, too. Her hesitance last night had certainly hinted at that.</p><p>It was the thing keeping her from speaking it into the quiet, Agatha realised: she didn’t know what she’d find when she finally found the guts to bring it up. Rio’s response carried far more weight than the actual question. Who knew what kind of worries were buried beneath that calm, charming surface?</p><p>Maybe she just needed some air, plain and simple. Or maybe she was already one foot out the door, inching away from the resounding realness of their circumstances. A child who wasn’t her own, who she hadn’t asked for, though she’d been aware of its presence from the start.</p><p>The thought was almost enough to bring Agatha’s morning sickness back, despite being well into her second trimester.</p><p>She was in the middle of picking furiously at a pimple that had erupted on her chin when the front door banged closed again, no more than an hour later. She tamped down another ripple of unease and tried to school her face into an expressionless mask in the mirror. It didn’t work—the discomfort still bled from her ice-blue eyes. Hopefully Rio wouldn’t catch it.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice rang out through the apartment.</p><p>“In here,” Agatha called back, cracking the bathroom door and poking her head out warily. Rio’s eyes lit up when she saw her, face breaking into an easy smile as she strode through the living room. Agatha took in her black mesh shorts and green sports bra, the strands of sweaty hair that were falling out of her ponytail, and shuddered a deep, silent sigh of relief. </p><p>Her instincts had been right—she’d just gone for a run. Nothing unusual about that.</p><p>Even better, Rio seemed completely fine, any shred of hesitance from the night before gone as she sauntered into the room. Agatha studied her to make sure, tracking her eyes over shades of amber and tiny flecks of green, before softening the set of her shoulders when she couldn’t see any semblance of doubt.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio greeted, hands finding Agatha’s hips. She closed her eyes and hummed contentedly while Rio placed a soft kiss to her cheek, then another to the space behind her ear.</p><p>With one last press of Rio’s lips against her neck, the worries she’d collected overnight faded into the balmy morning air. “Went for a run?”</p><p>“Mmm-hmm,” Rio replied, extracting her arms from Agatha’s sides and hoisting herself onto the bathroom counter. She sat there, hands resting behind her and legs swinging idly, and Agatha watched as a bead of sweat tracked its way from her hairline down her forehead.</p><p>She couldn’t help but step straight back into Rio’s space, reaching out to wick the droplet away from her brow with a thumb. “How many miles d’you get in?”</p><p>“Five,” Rio said with a grin. She spread her legs and pulled Agatha closer by the waist so her body was pressed up against the counter.</p><p>“You’re like the Energiser Bunny,” Agatha chuckled, sending her gaze skyward in disbelief. “Seriously, do you ever slow down?”</p><p>“Thought you liked me that way,” Rio smirked.</p><p>Oh, she did. It was attractive as all shit; there was no doubt about that. She leaned in for a confirmatory peck, tasting the salt and sweat on her lips.</p><p><em> This</em>—now, this she knew how to do. The easy stuff. Because being with Rio, letting herself be appreciated by her—that was the most natural thing she’d ever felt.</p><p>“Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you something,” Agatha said lightly, placing a hand against Rio’s knee. She’d totally forgotten about it until last night, while she was trying to reorient her thoughts towards something more productive. It had been tucked away in a back corner of her mind with all the other life admin she’d been avoiding, but now that everything seemed fine between them, it was as good a time as any to bring it up.</p><p>“I promised Billy I’d take him to a Broadway show on Friday night. I told him he has to invite Eddie,” she snorted, entertained by her own obvious attempt at pushing them together. “They’ve been dancing around each other for a year, and it’s about time they get things out in the open.”</p><p>“You’re evil,” Rio grinned.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha replied dryly, a smirk twitching on her lips. “So I was wondering… if you wanted to come with us?”</p><p>“Are you asking me on a date, Agatha?” Rio raised an eyebrow. She curled her hands around Agatha’s neck, and although this was nothing other than normal for them now—an easy magnetic pull that drew them together, time after time—the contact still made her breath hitch.</p><p>“Yes,” she nodded. There was no point in playing coy. “Are you accepting?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Rio said, her voice sure and steady. But then her smile dropped slightly, concern spilling out. “Are you—” she began, running her fingers up and down Agatha’s neck, exposed by the messy bun she’d tossed her hair into. “Are you okay with <em> us </em>being out in the open, though? Like, telling Billy? Your family?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. The thought hadn’t even crossed her mind until now. “Yeah,” she shrugged, trying to come off cool. “I already told Wanda.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio remarked. She didn’t sound upset—maybe just a little surprised. “I didn’t know that.”</p><p><em> Shit</em>, Agatha thought, the sinking feeling building in her belly again. Had she just broken some unspoken dating rule no one had thought to inform her of? She’d assumed it wouldn’t be a big deal, especially because Wanda had been her voice of reason over the last few weeks. Hell, Wanda was essentially responsible for her and Rio getting together in the first place.</p><p>“Is that…” she hesitated, trying to piece together what Rio was thinking. “Sorry, I probably should’ve mentioned it to you.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Rio replied easily. “They were gonna find out eventually.” She loosened her grip around Agatha’s neck and pried her own hair out of its ponytail holder, carding one hand through the messy waves that escaped. “So, does this mean I can tell Alice?”</p><p>“I’m surprised you haven’t already,” Agatha mused. She wondered if Rio had been keeping things from her friends until she gave the all clear—she <em> had </em>been pretty adamant about operating on her terms, after all. Still, there was no reason not to involve the people they cared about. Things were going so well. From where she stood, it felt like a natural next step. “Yeah, tell her. I don’t mind.”</p><p>“You know that means Jen’s going to be insufferable, right?”</p><p>“I’ll deal with Kale,” Agatha rolled her eyes, already picturing Jen’s reaction. God, she was about to be so fucking smug. “She’s all bark, no bite. Plus, it’s been a while since she got to say ‘I told you so’. Might be good for her ego.”</p><p>“We should like, have them over or something,” Rio suggested.</p><p>Okay… another crisis averted, it seemed. If Rio was already inviting her friends over—a double date, if Agatha was to go that far, which she <em> wouldn’t</em>, lest Rio get any ideas—she clearly didn’t care too much about her having told Wanda.</p><p>“Let’s go out,” Agatha said. “I need an excuse to leave the house. And Jen will be less annoying with other people around.”</p><p>“Fair point,” Rio nodded with a smirk. She pulled out her phone from her shorts pocket and began flipping through her calendar app. “Maybe next week?”</p><p>“Yeah, sounds good.”</p><p>Rio’s expression turned pensive, like she was weighing something up. “I should probably talk to Lilia as well, then,” she said carefully. “Introduce you guys.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Agatha blinked as Rio’s words settled. With past partners, she would’ve already been reaching for a distraction to steer the conversation away from the terrifying thought of meeting the parents. Well, foster parent, if they were getting technical. But she couldn’t deny that she wanted to meet Lilia, if only to learn a little more about who Rio was before they’d fallen into each other’s lives.</p><p>It made her feel brighter, hearing that Rio wanted that too. Hope spilled true and unapologetic between them, like an invisible tether. Because if this thing had an expiration date, printed somewhere Agatha couldn’t yet read, meeting Lilia wouldn’t be advisable—but here was Rio broaching it easily, breathing a tiny piece of their future into existence. </p><p>It was all the reassurance Agatha could’ve asked for in that moment, knowing that she cared about her enough to even consider introducing her to the most important person in her life. There were still big conversations full of messy feelings they needed to have, but maybe Rio was open to having them. Maybe she’d just read the whole thing entirely wrong.</p><p>Agatha rolled her shoulders back as she spoke, silently summoning the confidence to forge ahead. “I’d like to meet her some time,” she said. “In a few weeks?”</p><p>“Yeah, whenever you’d like,” Rio agreed gently. A smile crept back onto her face. “I’m sure Lilia would love it.”</p><p>“Cool,” Agatha replied, returning Rio’s smile with one of her own as the tension dissipated. “What time do you start work today?”</p><p>“Not until 10,” Rio said, glancing back down to her phone to check the time. “Which, according to my calculations, gives us… at least two hours. And I really, really, need a shower.”</p><p>Admittedly, she did—Rio was sweaty after her run, and they’d both fallen into bed last night without bothering to shower. Agatha could still feel the tackiness of her own dried slick between her thighs, the aftermath of coming so fucking hard she’d abandoned the basic tenets of personal hygiene.</p><p>“Breakfast after?” she asked hopefully. Rio quirked one brow in response, her tongue playing at the inside of her cheek. <em> Oh, </em> Agatha knew that look by now—it was the one that said she was about to get laid.</p><p>“I was thinking I could eat something <em> in </em>the shower,” Rio said, confirming her suspicions. Her hands tracked up and down Agatha’s arms, leaving goosebumps in their wake. “If you catch my drift.”</p><p>“Mmm, I’m not sure I do,” Agatha pretended to ponder, tracing circles against Rio’s knee with one languid finger. “How ‘bout you show me?”</p><p>Rio leapt off the counter, her body colliding with Agatha’s as her feet hit the floor. “I can do that.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Once Rio had headed to work, leaving a thoroughly fucked and fed Agatha behind, she felt full of life again, despite the lack of sleep. She guessed she’d better channel her newfound energy into something useful, which is how she ended up parked at the dining table with her laptop.</p><p>By midday, she’d managed to pour a whole two hours into writing her book, and it was coming along well. Gone was the writer’s block she’d been experiencing all throughout her pregnancy thus far, and in its place was a surprising amount of inspiration. She wouldn’t be wise to jinx it. No, this particular situation demanded that she simply lean in, in case it disappeared again.</p><p>She was close to done with the first draft now, and while the story had shifted and changed more times than she could count, it was shaping up to be something good.</p><p>Finally, all the pieces were falling into place.</p><p>Smiling at her progress, Agatha made a mental note to text Jen and update her, before switching browser tabs and navigating to the <em> Hadestown </em>website. First came work, then came all the things she’d been putting off. She scrolled through the booking portal and selected four tickets for Friday, before pulling a credit card out of her wallet.</p><p>Her eyes boggled momentarily at the price—who in their right mind paid $150 a ticket to watch people prance around on stage and sing show tunes?—but she entered her details anyway, muttering a “this better be fucking good” under her breath.</p><p>Once the confirmation screen appeared and all the funds from her checking account had been drained, Agatha grabbed her phone and opened a new message thread with her godson. <em> Shit </em>, she still hadn’t texted the other one.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Ask your little crush to come to Hadestown. I bought four tickets for Friday night.</p><p><b>Billy:</b> omg! </p><p><b>Billy: </b>four, tho??? who else is coming? pls don’t say mom</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Nope. Your mother can pick you up from my place afterwards.</p><p>She pondered whether to tell him now, knowing he’d see straight through her, or to leave it as a surprise. Billy’s reaction was probably best tempered by a phone screen—there was no knowing how obnoxious he’d be if she just showed up with Rio in tow.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>I invited Rio.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>!!!!!!!!!! i’m screaming!!!</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Don’t make this a big deal.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>are u like… dating or smth??</p><p>Straight for the jugular. Agatha groaned, rubbing her temple. Well, there wasn’t any point hiding it—and Rio had given her the all clear to tell people, though she hadn’t exactly realised it had been a secret up ‘til then.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Yes, we’re dating. I will not be taking further questions at this time.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>holy SHIT (don’t u dare tell me off for swearing) </p><p><b>Billy: </b>this is the best day of my life. all my gay dreams have come true</p><p>Agatha chuckled at his enthusiasm. Billy hadn’t been subtle about his desire to see her and Rio together after their last conversation. He’d even texted a few times asking if she’d told her she liked her yet, but Agatha had been too busy with Rio—so wrapped up in their bubble that she’d accidentally left the messages on read.</p><p>Still, she’d just assumed Wanda had spilled the beans by now. The woman had the world’s worst reputation for keeping her mouth shut.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>I’m surprised your mom didn’t tell you.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>oh my god she’s dead</p><p><b>Billy: </b>i can’t believe u told her before me. that’s cold</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Sorry, kid. She’s my unofficial therapist at this point.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>excuses </p><p><b>Billy: </b>well anyway i’m happy for u. welcome to the club 🌈</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, trying to fend off a smile, and sent one last text.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>No rainbows. This is your first and final warning.</p><p><b>Billy: </b>🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈</p><p>Little shit.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>The days between Monday and Friday flew by with an atypical ease, in a way that they hadn’t for months, if Agatha was to guess. Years, maybe. She couldn’t pinpoint the last time she felt like this—like there was something propelling her to wake up every morning, to keep treading the path she was on and seeing where it would lead. The baby, always the baby, but Rio, too.</p><p>Two of those mornings, she woke to an empty bed again, Rio already getting her miles in under the summer sun. It didn’t stir the same anxiety in her that it had initially—each time made things easier and more routine than the last. Especially when Rio insisted on pulling her into an embrace the second she returned home, covering her in enough sweat to force them both into the shower.</p><p>While they were only two weeks in, they’d learned each other’s bodies quickly, a not-unwelcome side effect of sharing the same space. They’d fucked practically every night since Sunday, in more positions than Agatha could name.</p><p>Of course, there was more to it than just sex. It was always about more than just sex—Agatha had held that truth in her hands since the very beginning. Even when they had their fingers or tongues buried in each other, there was something momentous about it. Like every time was as important as the first time.</p><p>
<em> “I want to look at you,” Rio panted, pressing her fingers to Agatha’s entrance from behind. Agatha was bent over the couch, and she could feel Rio’s tits dragging deliciously across her back as she worked up a rhythm against her clit, preparing to slip her fingers inside. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her head spun at the words—at the sincerity of them. “Okay,” she agreed, her own breathing shallow. Rio removed her fingers and flipped Agatha around swiftly so they were standing face-to-face, before anchoring her hands against the back of her thighs and lifting her onto the backrest of the couch. Like she was as light as a feather, no less—a feat that prompted another deep pulse between Agatha’s legs. She bit back a squeal as Rio’s nails dug into her ass, before moving to grip securely at her hips. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Put your hands back where I can see them,” Agatha teased, eyes flicking down to her own pussy, then back up at Rio. She smirked and obliged quickly, returning her thumb to Agatha’s clit before thrusting two fingers inside of her. Agatha moaned, long and slow, without breaking eye contact. </em>
</p><p>
<em> After a minute, Rio stepped even closer between Agatha’s legs, pushing firmly into her hip to make sure she didn’t topple from her precarious position on the edge of the couch. She used the closeness to rock against her own hand, all the while deepening her angle inside Agatha’s cunt, eliciting choked, breathy gasps from them both. </em>
</p><p>
<em> While Rio raked her fingers along her walls and circled her clit, Agatha never let her gaze drop from the woman in front of her. Not as the moans burst out of her uncontrollably, not as she contracted tightly around Rio’s fingers, and not as Rio came a minute later, smirking and shuddering as her orgasm took hold. The whole time, she kept blue fixated on Rio’s brown, drinking every inch of her in. </em>
</p><p>With every moan and kiss and press of skin, Agatha became a little more certain that this was going somewhere. That perhaps, if she could only summon the confidence to ask, talking to Rio about the baby—about their future—wouldn’t send things south in an instant.</p><p>Much to her relief, the doubt she’d perceived from Rio hadn’t reared its head again, either. Agatha had made a point of not bringing the baby up in conversation, instead focusing on the lighter topics of daily life. Her book, Rio’s work and school, setting up a time to hang out with Alice and Jen.</p><p>Still, the words had been rising in her throat all week, and now she knew it was only a matter of time before the dam broke. There wasn’t ever going to be a right time to do it, and letting it hang over her head for weeks or months, she’d decided, was immature. A coward’s move. Not the way a grown-ass woman would handle the situation.</p><p>She needed to ask, let Rio say her piece—whatever it might be—and accept the consequences. </p><p>But, it would have to wait at least one more day. Because tonight was about something else. Tonight was about letting herself relax for one fucking second.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been to a Broadway show for a few years, but she knew they were usually a semi-formal occasion—not something she could wear sweatpants and a t-shirt for, as much as she longed to. Comfort had taken priority over looking good since she’d pissed on a stick a few months ago, and now, she had the added roadblock of her bump to skirt around.</p><p>As she neared the half-way mark of pregnancy, it was growing by the day, and most of her clothes had become tight around the middle. If it had been winter, she would’ve just thrown on a stretchy knitted dress and left it at that. But it was still 90 degrees outside, even as July waned into August.</p><p>So what the <em> fuck </em>was she gonna wear?</p><p>Agatha rifled through the clothes in her closet, many of which hadn’t seen the light of day since the previous year. She could wear a suit… but the idea of a heavy jacket and pants that might only half-zip sounded suffocating. That dress would barely fit over her thighs, that one was too short, and <em>oh god</em>, she probably needed to buy maternity clothes. Yuck.</p><p>Well, 18 weeks seemed like a good innings.</p><p>Finally, tucked at the back on a flipped-around hanger, she found something that could work—a midi-length dress made out of a soft jersey fabric that clung to all the right places. Pre-pregnancy, it had been the perfect outfit for when she wanted to feel sexy, accentuating her boobs and ass.</p><p>Ralph had hated it because of the colour; had said it made her look like a stuffed olive, the asshole. But she just so happened to know someone who had a thing for green. And driving her wild sounded pretty good.</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the bathroom feeling, in a word, <em> hot</em>. She’d tamed her hair, straightening it before adding a gentle curl, and adorned her fingers and ears with gold jewellery. The excitement of letting Rio see her like this, of witnessing her reaction to the effort she’d put in, buzzed underneath her skin—but she’d barely taken two steps into the living room when her tack changed entirely.</p><p>The sight of Rio slammed into her with all the force of a freight train. Tanned skin, red lipstick, Agatha’s favourite smirk gracing her lips—and holy <em> fucking </em> moly, Rio was wearing an honest-to-god dress. Short and silky, with a low neckline that put the petals of her sternum tattoo and the sinful curve of her breasts on full display.</p><p>The ease with which this woman switched up on her was maddening. Boxers one day, a lacy bra and panties the next… and now, this. Agatha knew her face was painted with a predatory stare, but she couldn’t be bothered to compose herself. She wanted her, and Rio knew that—she was fully cognisant of what she was doing.</p><p>“What the hell is this?” Agatha breathed, already across the room and skimming a hand along Rio’s hip. She pinched the silk between two fingers, grabbing at taut skin in the process.</p><p>They were both wearing heels, so Rio still had a slight height advantage as she chuckled down at her, mirth dancing in her eyes. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean, why are you torturing me when we’re about to go out in public?”</p><p>“It’s just a dress, Agatha,” Rio replied breezily. “And really, that’s rich of you to say,” she continued, her line of sight trailing down to take in Agatha’s own attire. Brown eyes grazed over her breasts, then the swell of her stomach, accentuated by the tight fit of the dress. </p><p>Agatha half-expected Rio’s expression to turn introspective again when she reached her belly, but it didn’t. The corner of her mouth just ticked up in a smirk before her eyes met Agatha’s again with undisguised hunger.</p><p><em> Just a dress</em>, huh? Well, two could play at that game. “Oh, so you wouldn’t mind if I just…” she started, teasing her fingers underneath one of the thin straps that clung to Rio’s shoulders. Ugh, she could just slip them down, suck a pert, pink nipple into her mouth, sneak her other hand under the short hem of her dress, and—</p><p>“Ah-ah,” Rio tsked, stilling Agatha’s curious fingers. She tilted her head to place a quick kiss to her knuckles. “Later, baby,” she chided gently. “We have a show to catch.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>The Uber ride into Manhattan was an exercise in restraint of the highest possible level. Agatha fidgeted uncomfortably in the back seat, wishing she could mould her body to Rio’s right there and then. She looked so damn good, and she was all hers for the taking—just, irritatingly, not right now.</p><p>It didn’t stop her from gluing their hands together, trailing her fingers across Rio’s palm as they drove. They talked quietly, murmuring back and forth about inconsequential things like what they planned on having for dinner and how long it would take for Billy to embarrass himself in front of Eddie. The boys had decided to take the train over from Westview rather than getting dropped off at Agatha's apartment, which gave her and Rio a brief window to grab a bite to eat before they met them at the theater. </p><p>They slid into the corner booth of a greasy spoon, ordering a burger each—plant-based for Rio, who was back on her veggie kick this week—and a plate of fries to share.</p><p>“Nervous about meeting the family?” Agatha asked once she’d polished off her burger. She quirked a brow in Rio’s direction.</p><p>Rio chuckled, lips wrapped around the straw of her soda. “I’ve met Billy before, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha agreed. She reached one hand across the table and waited for Rio’s fingers to curl around her own. Only a millisecond later, they did. “But last time we were just friends. It’s a little different now, don’t you think?”</p><p>“You think your godson’s gonna give me the third degree? Grill me on my intentions?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips thoughtfully. “Probably,” she shrugged, popping one last fry in her mouth. “If he does, guess you better give it right back.”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me twice, sweetheart.” She raised both eyebrows, a challenging look on her face. “I’m a big girl, I can handle it. I handle <em>you</em>, after all.”</p><p>Suddenly, all the tension that had been simmering for the last few hours peaked, sharp and precise, even as the bustle of the busy restaurant went on around them. “Is that right?” Agatha murmured, her voice dropping low.</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her eyes locked onto Agatha’s. Agatha watched as Rio slunk down as best as she could in the vinyl seat, propping the hand that wasn’t attached to her own behind her head lazily. She heard a soft, almost imperceptible <em> thud</em>, then drew in a breath as Rio’s foot made contact with the bare skin of her calf. It dragged back and forth languidly, from her ankle all the way to the soft inside of her knee.</p><p>And, <em> fuck</em>—why had she agreed to leave the house again? It made no sense, when all she wanted to do was ravish Rio from head to toe, leaving no piece or part of her undiscovered before letting her do the same right back. This relationship involved far too much waiting for her liking.</p><p>“You’re really killing me here, babe,” Agatha groaned, shivering as the tiny hairs on her upper thighs stood to attention. Rio’s foot just crept higher, deftly navigating her dress until it was nestled underneath the fabric, stroking gently against her inner thigh.</p><p>And of all the goddamn scenarios Agatha had pictured could play out tonight, letting Rio get her off with her fucking <em> foot </em>in a crowded New York City diner wasn’t one of them.</p><p>She considered it for a beat longer than felt appropriate, the heat flaring between her legs as Rio’s foot moved dangerously close to her centre. But, as if divinely timed—like the universe knew Agatha’s self-control was hanging on by a thread—her phone buzzed harshly against the table before Rio could take things any further. Agatha’s eyes shot down to her phone, then up sheepishly at Rio, who was wearing the most delicious smirk she’d ever seen.</p><p>Ignoring the desire sparking in Rio’s eyes, she turned her phone over and quickly read the text that had appeared from Billy, announcing that he and Eddie had arrived at the theatre. Rio’s foot dropped back to the floor without ceremony, but the lustful look still lingered on her face. </p><p>How was she going to sit through three hours in a theatre next to this woman? Forget everything else that was currently swirling around in her disorganised, panic-prone brain—this was the real test of her mettle, she was sure of it.</p><p>“They’re here,” Agatha said, hoping her voice would do as she willed and stay steady. Rio smiled and hopped up from the table like nothing had happened, leaving a wad of bills behind as she extended her arm for Agatha to take. Chivalry was alive and well in the Vidal family line, it seemed.</p><p>Still trying to quiet the pulse between her thighs, Agatha wrapped her hand around the crook of Rio’s arm and let herself be led out into the night.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Fifteen minutes and a humid walk later, Agatha was standing at a high table in the theatre’s lobby, one hand wrapped around a plastic cup of soda water. Across from her sat Billy, dressed in all black—clearly leaning into the NYU theatre kid stereotype before he even finished high school—and Eddie, who was somehow more adorable than he’d appeared in the endless photos Billy had shown her over the past year.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, radiant as always, naturally holding court over the conversation. She’d said something to make Billy laugh, his eyebrow piercing catching the light as he threw his head back. Eddie looked on at him, his fond expression and the way his hands fumbled awkwardly at his sides all-too-familiar to Agatha—the boy was a goner. She hoped her godson could see it, though if he was anything like her, he’d probably keep dissecting it until it slapped him in the fucking face.</p><p>“You sure you don’t want to sit down?” Rio whispered, gesturing at her stool.</p><p>“Nah, I’m good,” Agatha smiled. She gave Rio a fond look of her own, tucking a strand of dark, wavy hair behind her ear. A soft, genuine smile bloomed on Rio’s face, and Agatha felt the world slow down around her as she zeroed in on the kindness of her eyes, the gap between her teeth. </p><p>How she could go from wanting to rip Rio’s clothes off in public one second, to swelling with pride and endearment the next, she’d never quite figure out. All she knew was that she was unfathomably lucky.</p><p>“You guys are really cute,” Billy smirked playfully, breaking Agatha from her trance. He looked down at Agatha’s hand, now resting casually on Rio’s thigh. Eddie nodded in agreement as Billy went on. “It’s nice to see my aunt so happy, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed at the compliment, and Agatha felt her own cheeks burn as well. </p><p>“Thanks, guys,” Rio said, smiling in their direction. “We are pretty cute, huh?” she added teasingly, leaning into Agatha’s side.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and rolled her eyes. Of course, the answer was yes—but she wasn’t going to admit that in front of her teenage godson, who’d take any opportunity to roast her for letting herself become so soft. “You’re pushing your luck, Vidal,” she warned. Rio’s smile widened into a grin.</p><p>“So, how’s the baby going in there?” Billy asked. Agatha blinked, turned around by the sudden change in topic, and met his expectant gaze.</p><p>“Oh, good,” she nodded, glancing down at her stomach. The clingy fabric of her dress made her bump look much more prominent than usual; no doubt in anyone’s mind that she was pregnant, not anymore. “Growing, giving me heartburn. Kicked me the other day,” she added.</p><p>Agatha tried to make it seem like an off-handed comment, but there was method to her madness. She wanted to see whether Rio’s expression wavered at the mention of the living, breathing human inside her. A test, of sorts—a precursor to the conversation she was now full steam ahead on having, as soon as she could get Rio alone in a safe, open space.</p><p>(After they’d had sex at least a few times, first. She had her priorities straight.)</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio out of the corner of her eye, trying to clock any subtle shifts in her face or posture. But, like earlier, they didn’t come—no, Rio didn’t move a muscle, her elbows still resting comfortably against the table.</p><p>“That’s crazy,” Eddie added. “It must feel so real, now. Are you guys excited?”</p><p>His tone was casual, the question innocent enough. But it hit so, so deep in Agatha’s gut, sending a wave of nausea roiling through her without warning.</p><p>Because <em> fuck</em>, how was the kid supposed to know that a simple phrase like <em> you guys </em> had the power to change everything—could slice right through the murky confusion that had followed her and Rio around for weeks?</p><p>This time, Agatha couldn’t help but tilt her head in Rio’s direction, her heart already thumping a broken beat. They were huddled so close it was no more than a micro-shift, but it felt significant all the same.</p><p>She looked at Rio. Rio looked back at her, and there was the fear again, at least, as far as she could tell—flickering underneath the surface, like a tiny, molten flame behind her eyes.</p><p>Agatha knew she should jump in, but she held her breath, paralysed and waiting for Rio to do something. To laugh it off with a joke, or school her expression back to careful neutrality before changing the topic. Her reaction, in the heat of this unfairly heavy moment, would tell her everything she needed to know.</p><p>For a moment, Rio didn’t move, didn’t speak. Her gaze held Agatha’s, steady and unflinching, until finally, something shifted—Rio reached between them and caught a hand with her own. The pressure was sure, warm, the faint rasp of a callus dragging against her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched at the feeling of Rio’s hand in hers. Instinctively, her fingers curled tighter around Rio’s, as she met her eyes with a small, encouraging smile. She prayed the small gesture conveyed all the things she’d yet to say out loud: <em> I want you here. I don’t know how, exactly, but I know I do. Please, please say you want it too. </em></p><p>There was still a faint trace of uncertainty behind Rio’s eyes, but as her thumb brushed lightly over the back of Agatha’s knuckles, something in her expression calmed. “Yeah,” Rio affirmed lightly, turning her attention back to the boys. “It’s very exciting.”</p><p>And while it wasn’t a promise, not yet, it had the makings of one—enough to let the hope spring wildly in Agatha’s chest.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Sitting through a three-hour Broadway show was, unexpectedly, not an awful way to spend a Friday night. The songs were good, the plot was captivating—this version of Greek mythology had much more going for it than Westview High School’s syllabus ever did—and the look of glee on Billy’s face as he took it all in made Agatha flush warm with joy.</p><p>Nothing, though, could hold a candle to the woman sitting next to her. Sweet, calm, and attentive to her every need.</p><p>And also a total menace who would proceed to spend the next three hours testing her patience like it was her fucking job.</p><p>Once they’d finished up their drinks in the theatre lobby, the four of them had heeded the call of the house open and settled into their seats inside—Rio, then Agatha, followed by Billy and Eddie.</p><p>It started out subtle, just a hand against her knee as the theatre lights dimmed and the performers appeared on stage. Agatha leaned into the touch easily, shifting so their thighs pressed together. If Rio had just left it there, she would’ve been happy—content to be close; to spend another night in her proximity.</p><p>Of course, she hadn’t, because Rio Vidal <em> loved </em>to toe the line. Their almost-scene in the diner earlier should’ve offered a hint at what to expect once they were in a dark, crowded room, but Agatha had been too wrapped up in her thoughts to preempt it.</p><p>So when Rio’s hand snaked up the outside of her thigh again, not even all the way through the first act, she shuddered with anticipation. The feeling of practised fingertips brushing against skin drew her right back to before, like they’d never left the moment—except now, though the setting was admittedly darker and less conspicuous, she was seated next to her fucking <em> godson</em>.</p><p>“You’re insatiable,” Agatha whispered, leaning across so her lips brushed against Rio’s ear. Rio’s hand just crept higher, slipping under the fabric of her dress and stilling against her inner thigh, posing a question Agatha couldn’t in good conscience dignify with a response.</p><p>“And yet, I don’t hear you telling me to stop,” Rio chuckled lowly.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned. Obviously, she wanted to let her keep going—but someone had to be the responsible adult here, and Rio had proven it wasn’t going to be her.</p><p>“Billy and his boyfriend are right there,” she reasoned, shooting a quick glance in their direction. Both of them were intently focused on the show, their arms resting against each other’s casually. Still, it was a terrible idea—there was barely five inches between her and Billy. “That not enough of a deterrent for you?”</p><p>Even in the dark, Agatha could see the petulant pout on Rio’s mouth. “Unfortunately, it is,” she sighed, expelling the air through pursed lips. Her hand reluctantly returned to Agatha’s knee.  “You know, they should make these theatres bigger. Put the seats further apart. More room for activities.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, baby.” Agatha looked down at her watch, squinting to see the time. “Your <em> activities </em> can wait… two more hours.”</p><p>“Ughhhh,” Rio groaned, her volume a little too audible, even as the show tunes raged on in the background. Agatha stifled a snort, slapping a hand against Rio’s arm to quiet her. Billy looked over at them curiously, but Agatha shot him daggers, then trained her own eyes on the stage. <em> Nothing to see here, kid. </em></p><p>A hundred and twenty minutes. A little over seven thousand seconds, if her math was correct. That couldn’t be so bad—could it?</p><p>It could, and it was. Though Rio had, perhaps a little resentfully, taken notice of her reprimands, she still tried her best to break Agatha’s composure as the night went on. At intermission, when Eddie and Billy escaped to find the restroom, Rio turned to her and placed a bold-faced kiss to her lips, like there weren’t still hundreds of people milling around them.</p><p>Agatha had to reach into the depths of her fucking soul to not return it hungrily, to keep her tongue from sliding into the wet heat of Rio’s mouth.</p><p>All through the second act, her resolve kept cracking as Rio sought as many touchpoints as she could without going below the belt. A hand on her arm, a touch to her thigh, careful fingers sweeping the hair back from her face. She wriggled in her seat at each one, her insides burning with unresolved tension.</p><p>Finally, mercifully, the last song began to play, the cast assembling on stage to take their bows. The crowd around them rose for a standing ovation, so Agatha stood, too, Rio following behind. Her arm instantly curled around Agatha’s waist, fingertips digging in lightly.</p><p>Agatha glanced over at the boys, who were grinning from ear to ear, Billy’s hand tucked into the crook of Eddie’s arm. That was new, and admittedly cute, though she’d tease him for it over text later.</p><p>Then, she looked back at Rio, tilting her head up so she could see her clearly. So pretty, so perfect, her shoulder flexing as she wrapped her arm tighter around Agatha.</p><p>She couldn’t wait to take her home. </p><p align="center">———</p><p>After they’d seen the boys off safely—thank god Wanda had agreed to come and pick them up from here, rather than their place—Agatha led Rio to the front of the theatre. They leaned against the brick facade of a building a few doors down while Rio stuck a cigarette between her lips, staring out at the gridlocked Manhattan traffic. The silvery veins of the lighter Agatha had bought for her birthday caught the streetlights as she lit it with practised ease.</p><p>“So,” Agatha started, wrapping a hand around Rio’s bicep. “Verdict?”</p><p>“The show was good,” Rio nodded, taking a drag of her cigarette. She blew the smoke carefully away from Agatha, in a long stream of grey that reached for the sky. “Or, what I paid attention to was, that is.”</p><p>“Too busy trying to keep your hands off me?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“It’s a full-time job,” Rio matched her, eyes twinkling as she flicked ash onto the pavement. “And on that note…” she added, turning her body to curl into Agatha’s, “home?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers traced the dark, fine lines of one of Rio’s tattoos—a snake that wrapped around layers of lean muscle. She let her voice drop lower, lacing it with the beginnings of a proposition. “Well, you have been teasing me all night,” she said. “Suppose it’s about time I let you have your way with me.”</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue into the side of her cheek. “I’ll order the Uber,” she drawled, stubbing her half-burnt cigarette against the wall and reaching for her phone.</p><p>“Already done, he’ll be here in five,” Agatha replied slyly, stilling Rio’s hand with her own. “I didn’t think it’d be that hard to convince you.”</p><p>“Oh, I need no convincing.”</p><p>The air between them during the car ride home was even thicker than on the way over; more charged with desire after hours of stolen glances, shameless flirting, and electric touches.</p><p>Whatever had arisen from Eddie’s comment seemed to stay put in Manhattan, fading away as they crossed the Williamsburg Bridge and drove deeper into the bowels of Brooklyn.</p><p>Agatha knew they’d talk about it soon, but not right now. Now, they both had far more important things on their mind.</p><p>As they pulled up to their block, Rio was out of the car in a flash, opening Agatha’s door and guiding her towards their place with an outstretched hand.</p><p>They barrelled through the lobby, then into the elevator, like they were the only two people in the world. Agatha couldn’t stop herself from crashing her lips into Rio’s as they travelled up to the sixth floor; from pressing their bodies together against the mirrored glass.</p><p>“Fuck, you still taste like that cigarette,” she murmured into the kiss, turning the smoky bitterness over on her tongue.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio winced. She pulled away sheepishly, but Agatha drew her in again by the back of her neck.</p><p>“No, <em> god</em>,” she groaned in affirmation, stealing another kiss. <em> Christ</em>, she hated how much she missed those stupid little cancer sticks. Almost five months with no vices to speak of was really wearing her thin. “It’s as close as I’m gonna get any time soon. Maybe ever again.”</p><p>“I should stop.” Rio shook her head shamefully, like it might shake the bad habit, too.</p><p>“Don’t quit on my account,” Agatha said. She ran her fingers through the fine hairs at the nape of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I would, you know,” she replied, her voice turning quiet and reverent. “For you.”</p><p>The moment shifted, becoming intimate in a different way as the silence settled between them. Agatha brought her hand from Rio’s neck to cup her face tenderly, stroking a thumb across her cheek. Suddenly, she felt too sentimental to bear—maybe a knock-on effect of all the hormones swirling throughout her body, or just a reflection of who she’d become in the two short months since she’d first met Rio.</p><p>If pressed, she’d only admit to the former… but there was more to it than that.</p><p>“I really, really like you,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know if I’ve told you enough.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed pink at the compliment. “Right back atcha,” she murmured, skating light fingers along Agatha’s waist, down her hips, around to the small of her back.</p><p>The elevator dinged and popped their bubble, doors opening wide as they reached their floor. Agatha’s eyes darted over to the emergency stop, compelled to close the doors and pull it—because all she wanted to do was stay right here, kissing Rio, basking in the warmth of her body and the softness of her skin. But that wasn’t the behaviour of a responsible, HOA-fee-paying homeowner who was likely being recorded by a security camera.</p><p>Luckily, their apartment was just down the hall. Agatha tugged at Rio’s hand and they fell out of the elevator together, crossing the floor to the front door in a few quick steps. Rio dug her keys out of her bag, and Agatha watched on with a dry mouth as she unlocked it.</p><p>The heat was growing in her belly, but something softer lingered underneath it. Images flooded her mind, so vivid they felt real—walking through the same door, in the same apartment block, in the same city, from now until… well, forever, if she got her way.</p><p>For now, just the two of them. But soon, three.</p><p>See, <em> that </em> was something she could be sure of. She wanted Rio here, as long as she was willing to stay. And even if the little voice she daydreamed about wasn’t calling Rio <em> mom </em>, surely she’d play a role in its life. She needed that—there wasn’t a way they’d work without it.</p><p>They tumbled through the door, Agatha’s mouth seeking out Rio’s again the minute it closed behind them. As Agatha drew her into a starved kiss, firm hands found her ass, and before she knew it, she was being lifted gently off the floor. She shrieked as her feet left the ground and instinctively wrapped her legs around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“Careful!” Agatha yelped, unsure whether to laugh and let Rio do her thing or demand she put her down. She landed on reluctant acceptance. “If you drop me, you’re taking me to the hospital.”</p><p>“I won’t drop you,” Rio reassured her softly. To Agatha’s relief, she didn’t, instead carrying her the few steps down the hallway to the bedroom. Agatha could feel both of their dresses bunching up, and Rio scooping her up in a fucking dress like this? Like it was nothing? Insanely hot. No notes.</p><p>She’d never question Rio’s strength again, although she’d definitely wonder when she had time to go to the gym amidst working two jobs, studying for a master’s degree, running twenty miles a week, and now, dating her.</p><p>Rio set her gently on the edge of the bed, linking their hands together as she stepped between her parted knees. Her fingers traced Agatha’s thigh delicately, over the ridden-up fabric of her dress.</p><p>“So sexy,” she murmured, one hand wandering between Agatha’s legs to cup her clothed cunt.</p><p>Before Rio could sink to her knees, though, Agatha stopped her with a firm hand. “As much as I love you eating me out,” she breathed, trying and failing to keep her voice steady, “there’s this thought that I can’t seem to get out of my head.”</p><p>“Tell me more.”</p><p>“I want to ride you,” Agatha said, head already flooded with images of Rio filling her up, of her hips stuttering as she stared down at brown eyes and a mouth parted with lust. “Do you have…”</p><p>Rio was a quick study. “Mmm-hmm,” she murmured, her breath momentarily catching. “In my room.”</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio swallowed so thickly that Agatha could see the bobbing of her throat, but she didn’t hesitate, pulling Agatha up from the bed and leading her silently down the hall.</p><p>They stopped in front of Rio’s room, her hand hovering on the doorknob. Agatha cocked her head at her questioningly. </p><p>“Need to clean up your mess first?” she joked. It turned the heat of the moment from a blazing fire back down to a simmer, but Agatha didn’t care. No, she relished it—the way they could break apart and come back together so easily, without ever missing a beat.</p><p>“No,” Rio grinned. “I’ll have you know it’s spotless, at least by my standards. You just…” she twisted her lips together shyly, smile still breaking through. “You haven’t been in here yet.”</p><p>It sparked a deja vu from the first time Rio had crossed over the threshold into Agatha’s bedroom just a week ago, of the way she’d walked around the space, diligently taking in all of the things that Agatha deemed inconsequential, but to her, clearly meant something. It was funny, and effortlessly sweet—the importance she assigned to all the little moments.</p><p>“Rio, it’s my place,” Agatha chuckled softly. “I’ve been in your room.”</p><p>“Since I moved in, I mean.”</p><p>“Well, I hope you haven’t put any unnecessary holes in my walls,” she smirked, lifting an eyebrow. </p><p>“None,” Rio confirmed. “Wouldn’t dare without checking with the boss first.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the nickname, a remnant from their early days of living together, but let herself be led through the door anyway.</p><p>Utterly changed from the last time Agatha had seen it, Rio’s room was like a window to her soul. A sage green comforter on the bed, neatly made from whenever the last time she’d slept in there was… over a week ago, if Agatha recalled correctly. </p><p>The book she had bought for her birthday was tucked amongst a towering pile on one bedside table, some worn and dog-eared and others new. She spied a sheet of multicoloured tabs on top of the book stack, and a few peeking out from various pages.</p><p>And, of course, there were plants fucking <em> everywhere</em>, from succulents and cacti in glass terrariums, to ivy and strings of pearl trailing from pots on the windowsill. A living, breathing testament to the care that Rio exercised so easily—the same care she’d always shown Agatha, without fear or restraint.</p><p>While Agatha took in her surroundings, Rio had another task on her mind. Within a few seconds of walking through the door, she was on her knees, rummaging around in the bottom drawer of her dresser. Once she’d found what she was looking for, she hopped to her feet and cleared her throat. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped over to Rio—who was grinning like the cat who’d got the cream—and almost rolled back in her head once she saw what she was holding: a nylon harness in one hand, and a purple dildo in the other, still in its box.</p><p>She practically ran towards her. “Did you buy this for me?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said teasingly, cracking the brand-new toy from its packaging. She discarded the excess cardboard and plastic on top of the dresser, while Agatha grabbed the harness and turned it over in her hands.</p><p>“Can I put it on you?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio groaned, her eyes flashing dark. The sound of her name escaping Rio’s mouth, spilling out like she could barely keep a hold of it, was intoxicating. “Yes, baby, please.”</p><p>Agatha gripped Rio’s hand as she carefully lowered to her knees, the hardwoods scraping cartilage and bone in a way she didn’t care about one bit. Rio had already done half the work for her by shimmying out of her underwear, leaving a pool of black lace on the floor.</p><p>She tapped a foot and cleared Rio’s panties out of the way to slip the harness up one leg, then the other. “Hold your dress for me,” she instructed. Rio went to pull it over her head, but Agatha raised a stern eyebrow. “Did I say you could take it off?”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted in surprise, but her arms slipped back down to her sides obediently, the silky hem still dangling from her fingers. The other hand moved to thread through Agatha’s hair while she got to work. With the dress out of the way, Agatha lifted the harness into place and deftly tightened its straps around Rio’s hips.</p><p>“You’re surprisingly good at this,” Rio remarked, staring down at her through thick lashes.</p><p>Agatha bit back a chuckle, very committed to saying her next words with a straight face: “Well, I <em> have </em>worn one before.”</p><p>She could practically hear the record scratch. “Sorry?” Rio sputtered. Agatha just kept fiddling with the straps of the harness, her smirk building as she averted Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck?” she asked again. Her voice shook a little, and it made Agatha’s head spin.</p><p>“Formerly straight people wear strap-ons, too, Rio,” she chastised playfully. “I had an ex,” she added, waving a hand as if that explained everything.</p><p>“Oh my god, I didn’t think it was possible,” Rio said. Her eyes were brimming with awe as she tilted Agatha’s face up to meet hers, one finger hooked underneath her chin.</p><p>“Didn’t think what was possible?”</p><p>“To be any more attracted to you,” Rio growled, the hand around Agatha’s jaw tightening.</p><p>Agatha held out one hand for the dildo and began to fasten it through the O-ring. “Oh, baby,” she sighed softly, securing the silicone firmly into place. She rocked back on her heels to admire her handiwork. “You haven’t seen the half of it.”</p><p>Rio’s hand fell away from her face, but she kept staring at her like she was the last woman on earth. “Then show me,” she goaded, extending a hand to pull Agatha to her feet.</p><p>She squared her hands against Rio’s shoulders and shot her a hungry gaze. If that’s what Rio wanted—well, it was what Rio would get.</p><p>“Get on the bed,” Agatha commanded, the thrill of seizing control igniting every nerve ending.</p><p>She needed no further instruction, scrambling backwards and propping herself up on her hands. The dildo sat erect between her legs, already spread wide and waiting.</p><p>“Lube’s in the top drawer,” Rio panted, her eyes flicking towards the bedside table. Agatha snorted as she clambered on top of Rio, kneeling in between her thighs—that wouldn’t be necessary. No, she had other plans for Rio’s cock. Instead of answering, she took the strap in one hand and leaned down to wrap her lips around it, its deep purple breaking through shades of pink and red.</p><p>The moan that spilled from Rio’s throat on impact was primal, intensified when Agatha pressed down hard on the strap. She swirled her tongue around the tip, then dragged it slowly down the length, taking her sweet time while Rio squirmed and fidgeted.</p><p>The sound of her own name hit the air again, even more beleaguered than before. “<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>She looked up at the woman underneath her, already past the point of no return, and smiled lasciviously around the mouthful of silicone.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, you’re so pretty,” Rio babbled. “So pretty sucking my cock.”</p><p>At that, Agatha’s head dipped lower, and Rio’s hips keened up, forcing even more of the strap into Agatha’s mouth so it brushed against her soft palate. Tears sprung to her eyes, the gag rising in her throat, but she pushed past it, bobbing her head up and down against the dildo while Rio flung hers back—clearly feeling the effects of the grind pad rasping at her clit.</p><p>“Think you can come like this?” Agatha panted, easing the strap out of her mouth. The silicone was soaked with her spit, spilling down the shaft onto her fingers, still tightly clasped at the base where it met Rio’s cunt. A spot of saliva had appeared on the silk hem of Rio’s dress, staining the already-dark fabric blacker than night.</p><p>Agatha took it all in with a sick sort of pride, then resumed her task, filling her mouth with the hard length again.</p><p>“God, yes,” Rio choked out, though Agatha had already made the decision for her. “I’m already s–so close—oh, <em> fuck</em>,” she gasped. “Please, baby, don’t stop.”</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Agatha could see the flush that was working its way across Rio’s tanned skin, enveloping her face and neck and chest. The muscles in her abs contracted, tensing tightly amidst the rapid rise and fall of her belly. She wasn’t lying—Rio was on the precipice, that much was clear.</p><p>She trained her eyes on Rio’s, then took as much of her cock into her mouth as she could, groaning loudly when it hit the back of her throat again.</p><p>And, yeah… that’d do it. Rio’s mouth fell open, her own moans escaping unfettered as her thighs locked up underneath Agatha. She came long and slow, eyes cast towards the heavens, like the ceiling might just open up and bathe them both in holy rays of light.</p><p>As Rio’s breathing slowed, Agatha finally moved her mouth off the strap and latched it to the tender flesh of her inner thigh. She sucked with all her might until a blood red bruise bloomed there.</p><p>“That was…” Rio shook her head, barely able to keep the grin off her face as she looked down at Agatha. “Insane. You’re insane.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha smirked, wiping the spit from her chin. “Now, where were we?” </p><p>She grabbed a hold of the dildo again suggestively, then shimmied up Rio’s thighs so it was pressing against her stomach. God, she was so wet—she could feel the slick soaking through her shitty excuse for underwear, warm and waiting for Rio’s cock. They’d been damp all night, since hours before the show. Maybe since before they’d left the house.</p><p>Rio bit her bottom lip, then reached up to take the hem of Agatha’s dress. She pulled it off easily, tossing it onto the bed beside them. Agatha felt the cool air hit her nipples and turn them hard in an instant.</p><p>She’d never get over this feeling. Nothing—no one—had ever made her weak the way this woman did. Taking all her bones and turning them to dust beneath her hands, like her touch was magic.</p><p>After making quick work of her soaked underwear, Agatha splayed her palms against Rio’s chest and smiled. One hand wandered down to tweak at a pert nipple. “Ready to go again, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” she breathed, her brown eyes already clouded over with desire once more. “Want to be inside you.” Her hands moved around to cup Agatha’s ass, digging in blunt nails to claim the tender flesh there.</p><p>Unable to quiet the persistent pulsing between her legs any longer, Agatha let herself be guided off Rio’s lap so she was hovering above the purple dildo. She sank down onto it in one go, without hesitation, feeling the stretch as Rio’s cock filled her cunt. </p><p>“<em>Fuuuuck</em>,” she groaned, tipping her head back so her hair spilled in one long curtain down her back. Rio’s hands raked at the ends of it, tugging gently.</p><p>Agatha began to rock her hips, setting a brutal rhythm while Rio writhed underneath her. Wet, dirty, delicious sounds filled the room.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio stammered, “you’re taking me so well.” Her thumbs clung tightly to Agatha’s ass, holding her while she kept up her pace, riding Rio exactly like she’d pictured.</p><p>“So full of you, baby,” Agatha panted in reply, staring down into Rio’s dark eyes. “Touch me,” she begged. “Need your fingers.”</p><p>Rio moved one hand around to Agatha’s front and quickly started working at her clit, too eager to make her wait for it. “I’ve got you,” she soothed, spreading Agatha’s wetness around as she alternated between tight circles and light, teasing flicks.</p><p>Agatha felt her pussy clench around Rio’s cock, the ripples that coursed through her offering a taste of the orgasm that was soon to come. After a few minutes of relentless riding, Rio’s fingers speeding up against her clit while the other hand showed no mercy to her ass and hips and tits, it arrived—seismically. Like a fucking 10 on the Richter Scale, destroying everything in its path, turning it all to ash.</p><p>The sound that escaped Agatha’s lips as it hit her fell somewhere between a whine and a roar, ricocheting off the walls of Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>With Rio’s cock still buried deep inside her, Agatha pitched forward helplessly, her slowly-weakening ab muscles no longer capable of holding her upright. In a flurry of movement, Rio sat up and grabbed at her hips, steadying her before she could fall.</p><p>“Whoa, there,” Rio chuckled breathlessly, her pupils still blown. “Don’t be going all boneless on me, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away—she couldn’t, not when Rio’s cock had just razed the world around her to the ground. She chased her own breath, mouth hanging open, certain that she looked wrecked beyond repair.</p><p>“Yours might be the best dick I’ve ever had,” she eventually sighed, letting her head slump against Rio’s shoulder. One thumb had begun to rub circles over her hipbone, a calming presence amidst all the chaos they’d created.</p><p>“Might be, huh?” Rio challenged, turning her head so Agatha could see the glint forming in her eye. She smiled bashfully. Fine—there was no competition. Rio smirked back at her, like she knew the game had been won.</p><p>She rested a hand atop of Rio’s, finally feeling grounded enough to continue. “Can I finish you off?”</p><p>“You’re too good to me,” Rio murmured affirmatively. She licked her lips while Agatha eased herself off the strap, slowly and carefully, as not to flare the tenderness building between her legs. The purple length of the dildo was shiny with her arousal, trickling down its hilt, and Agatha couldn’t help but capture it with her lips one last time. It made Rio moan. God, she was good.</p><p>Once she was kneeling at the base of the bed—of course, not before grumbling about Rio’s egregious lack of throw pillows—Agatha hastily removed the strap and harness and threw them down next to her. And <em>god</em>, Rio’s cunt must’ve been aching. She could see how fucking turned on she was, come glistening through coarse hairs from her clit down to her entrance.</p><p>She licked over the mark she’d left on Rio’s inner thigh earlier, nipping at it gently with her teeth and enjoying the sounds of pleasure it elicited. Then, needing no invitation, she buried her face in Rio’s cunt and started lapping tenderly at her clit.</p><p>As Rio shook and squirmed and cried out around her tongue, reaching her peak just a few moments later, Agatha couldn’t push down the fucking wonder of it all.</p><p>Two months ago, she’d been sad, alone, and feeling broken, like the heroine at the start of a Jane Austen novel. Now, she had everything she’d never realised she’d wanted—or maybe, that she’d never been able to <em> admit </em>she wanted.</p><p>Her baby was safe and healthy, baking away in there on perfect schedule. Her home felt like her own again, shared with someone who actually enjoyed her presence. Best of all, she’d found it—her peace. Right here, basking in the afterglow of earth-shattering sex, buoyed by the memory of a hand pressing warmly into hers like a good omen for what was to come.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>The next morning, Agatha woke before Rio, in a rare turn of events. She basked in it for a moment, inhaling the clean, earthy scent of her skin and hair, sinking a little further into her tight hold. Then, like a woman on a mission, she untangled their limbs and tiptoed into the kitchen to set the scene.</p><p>Scrambled eggs, one of the only things she was okay at cooking. Toast, slightly burnt—accidental but unsurprising. Fruit, cut carefully into pieces. And last, but never least, coffee. She set the table with matching plates and readied one of Rio’s mugs, hoping the aroma would lure her from sleep.</p><p>No such luck. Five minutes of scrolling through the news on her phone later, Agatha nuked the coffees in the microwave and piled everything onto a tray. Breakfast in bed was more romantic anyway. And, to be quite fair, the ache that was spreading across her thighs and abdomen from the events of last night—events that had continued well into the early hours of the morning—would benefit from a comfortable surface.</p><p>“Morning, babe,” she whispered, cracking the door to Rio’s room. She was met with a sight that immediately catapulted itself to her top five favourites of all time. Rio, bleary-eyed and smiling, the dark green sheets and sage comforter falling around her naked frame as she wriggled to sit up in bed.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio replied softly. Her eyes widened as Agatha made her way into the room and she noticed the tray laden with food. “You cooked?” she asked, not bothering to hide her incredulity.</p><p>“Lower your expectations,” Agatha chuckled, sitting on the edge of the bed and placing the tray in front of Rio. “It’s just eggs. Hopefully they’re edible.”</p><p>She watched as Rio took a plate and scooped a forkful of eggs into her mouth. Her face didn’t immediately twist with disgust, but rather, lit up like she was eating a gourmet fucking meal. “They’re great, baby,” she hummed happily, shovelling more into her mouth with fervor.</p><p>“You don’t have to lie to me. They’re passable at best.”</p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, grinning. “You can cook more often.”</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. Rio matched it, then rolled her eyes: “Fine, I’ll keep doing the cooking.” They chuckled together, content with the natural order of things.</p><p>Satisfied that Rio wasn’t going to spit her breakfast all over the bed, Agatha settled back beside her, propping herself up against the pillows. She grabbed the other coffee cup from the tray and took a sip. “How’d you sleep?”</p><p>“Good,” Rio murmured in agreement. “You?”</p><p>“Like a fucking baby,” Agatha replied. She looked down at her stomach, covered in the purple floral print of her robe, and patted it gently. “We both did.”</p><p>Another tentative smile crept across Rio’s face. A good sign, if Agatha had to call it then and there—though the conversation she’d been eluding for far too long was her only shot at a real confirmation.</p><p>She summoned all her courage and looked Rio in the eye. With a few bites of food in her belly, and the coffee beginning to do its thing, now was as good a time as any. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure,” Rio nodded, taking a bite of toast. She didn’t mention the slight char that coated the underside of the bread, instead just chewing gratefully.</p><p>“So, last night,” Agatha began hesitantly. “Did you, uh, mean what you said? That you’re… excited about the baby?”</p><p>Rio swallowed her toast, then reached across to lay a hand on Agatha’s thigh. Her expression was still simple, open, like the question hadn’t really hit its intended mark. “Of course I’m excited for you, Agatha,” she said. “It’s a momentous thing in your life.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha smiled tightly. She appreciated the support, but it wasn’t the answer she needed. “But how do <em> you </em>feel about it?” she probed, fighting the desire to hide her face in her mug as she asked. “Do you— do you ever think about what it means for us?”</p><p>Agatha braced herself for Rio to deflect. It wouldn’t be the first time, though she didn’t carry any ill will towards her for it. She reminded herself of it often—Rio was young, and while the baby had been part of the equation all along, neither of them had expected their relationship to grow the way it had. The way it still was, upwards and outwards like the branches of a tree.</p><p>If asked, she’d confidently tell anyone Rio was all in on <em> her</em>, at least for now. The way those amber eyes crinkled warmly when she saw her across the room, the ease with which she took care of her, like it was as natural as breathing. All the little things other people had noticed before she had—they all added up to something indisputable.</p><p>But until last night, until she’d felt Rio’s hand in hers, there’d been no concrete signs she was really thinking about their future. About what this meant weeks, months, <em> years </em> from now, when there was a tiny, time-consuming third person involved. They needed to hash it out before Rio found herself living in a fucking <em> Modern Family </em>episode against her will.</p><p>Agatha watched her expression become pensive, tongue poking out to wet her lips. “Mmm-hmm,” she nodded. “More than you might expect.”</p><p>“Please elaborate.”</p><p>“Are we doing more lesbian talking now?” Rio joked. Nope, Agatha wasn’t going to let her get off that easily—not this time.</p><p>“Yes,” she pressed. She turned her body inwards, balancing her coffee cup on the bed, and tapped a finger to Rio’s chest. “Talk.”</p><p>Rio sighed, then set her almost-clean plate down beside her. Agatha’s stomach tensed involuntarily, nervous butterflies scaling their way up her oesophagus as Rio flipped back around to face her, crossing her legs.</p><p>She spoke slowly, cautiously, like she was considering every word. “I really am excited for you, Agatha. Truly. I just—” she paused, eyes flicking away briefly. </p><p>“I think I got kinda caught up in not rushing you, in letting you be in control of the narrative that I didn’t think about what this meant in the long run,” she chuckled quietly.</p><p>“Before you kissed me, I wasn’t worried about how this would play out. I told myself it was just a crush, that it’d pass because you’d never be interested in me,” Rio continued. She dipped her head to hide the blush that was creeping across her cheeks. “And then you <em> did </em>kiss me, and now we’re here, and I—”</p><p>Rio tilted her face back up then, eyes immediately finding Agatha’s. They were warm as always, but softer now, betraying a vulnerability Agatha had yet to witness from her.</p><p>“I love kids. I’ve always wanted kids someday. And while I didn’t expect there to be a kid in my life so soon… I want to be here for it,” Rio admitted. “I’m just not sure what that looks like, yet.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, then left her body in a long, slow exhale. She began to turn the words over in her mind, desperately clinging to the first part of Rio’s sentence, but parsing through the second.</p><p>A pregnant pause fell between them, full and heavy—the way her belly had started to feel.</p><p>Okay, there was no need to catastrophise. This was positive. Rio was communicating her feelings, like she’d asked, and those feelings didn’t include revulsion or all-out fear. She just needed a little time, and Agatha couldn’t fault that. </p><p>God only knew if the roles were reversed, she’d be begging for the same kind of mercy ten times over.</p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha nodded, though every frantic movement of her head pulled something a little tighter in her chest. “We can go slow,” she reasoned. “It’s only been a few weeks.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio huffed out a laugh, the corners of her mouth turning up. “Feels like a lot longer, sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in agreement. Rio was right—she could barely remember what it was like without her here, invading her space, then her bed. Her life. And now, dangerously, her heart.</p><p>Throughout it all, Rio had been so insistent on letting her set the pace that Agatha had never really stopped to wonder whether it was solely for her benefit. Maybe it was just as much about Rio and what she needed as it was about her.</p><p>And fuck, Agatha owed it to her to not freak out; to simply ride the wave and see which shore they’d wash up on. While the idea of loosening the reins was scary, a careful sense of optimism had already started to creep in. As long as they were together—as long as they kept talking things through—surely they could make it work.</p><p>Agatha reached over and took Rio’s hand from where it had fallen into her lap. “I want you to know that you don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for,” she said, squeezing Rio’s hand. “I’m not asking you to, like… be a parent, or anything. I knew I’d be doing this alone from the start.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly as Agatha continued. “Nothing about this has to change, if you don’t want it to. Nothing about <em> us </em>has to change,” she repeated.</p><p>“And that’s what you want?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I—” No. Yes. Maybe—<em>fuck</em>. Agatha wanted… well, Agatha just wanted Rio here. That was as far as she’d actually gotten. It was curious, that amidst all the spiralling she’d become so accustomed to, she’d never stopped to chart their future course.</p><p>Sure, there had been moments where she’d let herself dream a little, her mind running wild with possibility. But Rio was right—they were all of two weeks into this thing. Agatha had fucking food in the fridge that was older than their relationship, but the intimacy of living together had created a pressure cooker, making it feel a lot further along than it actually was.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t even sure they were <em> in </em>a relationship. They hadn’t put a name to it, yet.</p><p>Taking it slowly, not rushing into a resolution that would be too hard to come back from—that was the sensible thing to do. Not just for the both of them, but for the baby, too.</p><p>“I want you to feel comfortable,” Agatha encouraged gently. “So let’s just take this day by day. See where it leads.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio exhaled softly through her nose, lips tightening into a small smile. She brushed her thumb over Agatha’s cheek, then bridged the distance between them with a kiss.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and surrendered to Rio’s mouth, gripping the back of her neck to hold her there just a little longer.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>Two weeks ebbed by, the last dregs of summer stretching out in front of them… and <em> slow</em>? Well, Agatha was beginning to realise that <em> slow </em>mightn’t be that bad, after all.</p><p>The first few days after their conversation had felt tinged by Rio’s admission, but not irreversibly coloured. They’d still gone about their lives as normal, and with every hour that passed, they’d fallen deeper into a new normal. Agatha felt the optimism bleeding back in as she reminded herself of the good—Rio’s tentative but genuine <em> I want to be here</em>.</p><p>She didn’t doubt there’d be plenty more conversations to come, the closer she got to her due date and the realer things became. But Rio’s soft reassurance had done wonders to quiet her mind. They’d taken a baby step—and that had to count for something.</p><p>The two of them were enjoying a lazy Saturday morning in bed, Agatha’s head resting against Rio’s stomach while her fingers carded through messy, sleep-mussed hair. </p><p>With September just a few weeks away, the weather had already started to turn. Agatha was eagerly awaiting fall, her favourite season by miles—the rust-coloured leaves, the light chill in the air, an excuse to break out coats and scarves—but first, she was going to enjoy these last days of summer.</p><p>“Do you want to go for a walk today?” she asked Rio, craning her head up to look at her. </p><p>Rio smiled. Damn, she adored that smile—the way her eyes crinkled, the little gap in her teeth. “Yeah, that sounds nice. Central Park?”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha agreed happily. Central Park, Prospect Park, she didn’t really care. Anything to walk around with a cold drink in one hand and Rio’s in the other. “Guess I better get ready, then,” she added, giving Rio’s thigh a quick squeeze.</p><p>“I’ll go make the coffee.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head from Rio’s stomach and rolled over carefully, straddling her waist to offer a quick, tender kiss. “Thanks, baby,” she grinned. “No sugar, please. It’s giving me heartburn.”</p><p>“Well, we can’t have that,” Rio mused. “You’re sweet enough, anyway.”</p><p>“And you’re a corny loser,” Agatha teased.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed pink, a chuckle bursting from her lips. “Maybe.”</p><p>“<em>Definitely</em>. But you’re my corny loser.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t meant to say it. It had just slipped out, greased by the beautiful, unerring simplicity of their morning together, the sunlight casting a golden glow on Rio’s face. But she’d be stupid to pretend she didn’t mean it—<em> mine.</em></p><p>Rio didn’t say anything in response, but she didn’t have to. Agatha knew she felt it too, just by the way her grin settled into a softer, more sincere smile. “Okay, go shower,” she said, running her hands along Agatha’s waist. “I’ll have your caffeine ready when you’re done.”</p><p>Agatha gently eased herself off Rio’s lap, a little too heavy to leap up effortlessly, and strolled into the en suite bathroom connected to Rio’s room. Though they’d started to alternate sleeping arrangements based on the day—and whoever’s sheets were clean—half her shit was in there, now.</p><p>She cast one last glance back at Rio, grinning slyly as she pulled her shirt over her head, then closed the door.</p><p>While the steam of the shower swirled around her, Agatha chuckled fondly at the sound of Rio’s cooking playlist wafting from her portable speaker, underscored by the clink of plates and cups. She wouldn’t be surprised if there was a gourmet breakfast waiting for her by the time she finished up.</p><p>The soft, lilting music continued as she scrubbed her body, then her hair, finally stepping out of the shower and drying herself off.</p><p>Just as she was pulling on a pair of linen pants, though, it stopped, replaced by a low, rapping noise—someone at the door. Maybe Rio had ordered groceries, or they’d gotten a package, though she couldn’t remember buying anything online. She threw on her t-shirt and wrapped a towel around her hair, wandering out of the bathroom to investigate.</p><p>Agatha was halfway down the hallway when she heard the rumbling of a man’s voice, long before he appeared in her view. Her pulse immediately ratcheted up as the familiar cadence sank in—oh, no. Not now. Not ever, ideally—but certainly not fucking <em> now</em>.</p><p>“Is Agatha here?” the voice came.</p><p>“Uh, yeah,” she heard Rio say, sounding confused and caught off guard. “Sorry, who are you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t give him the chance to reply, instead bursting into the kitchen, her eyes already wild with anger. She whipped her head around to look at Rio, who was frowning deeply, then back at the smug asshole lingering in the doorway.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“What the fuck, Ralph?” Agatha asked again, blinking rapidly at the man standing at the entrance to her apartment as if he might just be a figment of her imagination. Maybe if she closed her eyes, or tapped her heels together three times, he’d disappear.</p><p>Though she wouldn’t deign to try it, she knew she was shit out of luck. This wasn’t a Judy Garland movie, and Ralph was definitely real. He was leaning lazily against the doorframe, scratching his head and taking everything in.</p><p>He was also, if Agatha was to hazard a guess, wondering what he’d walked into, though it was resolutely none of his business.</p><p>She strode closer to the door, stopping two or three paces behind Rio, who was still holding it open. “What the hell are you doing here?” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Came to see the mother of my child,” Ralph shrugged, averting her fiery gaze. He looked straight at Rio with a curious expression, and it made Agatha bristle, the way he shamelessly examined her without actually addressing her. Meanwhile, Rio’s confused frown had turned into a cold look of recognition out of the corner of Agatha’s eye.</p><p>“Thought you’d be missing me by now,” he added.</p><p>“And why in god’s name would you think that?” Agatha retorted, folding her arms across her chest. The response came automatically, like she’d had it locked and loaded somewhere in the filing cabinet of her brain, ready to pull out when faced with this exact scenario. “I haven’t called or texted since you packed up and left me dry-heaving on the bathroom floor.”</p><p>The truth—it had taken approximately two weeks after finding out she was carrying his baby for Ralph to skip out the door without a fleeting glance behind him. Like her, he’d made no attempts at contact since. No asking for updates on the baby, no offer to coparent—nothing.</p><p>Still, Ralph had always been a self-righteous jerk, never the type to tuck his tail between his legs. It was deeply in character for him to pop up now, on his terms and not hers.</p><p>He looked at her, his beady eyes narrowing. “I know you, Agatha,” he taunted.</p><p>She did nothing to stifle her snort of disbelief. Yeah, she’d spent seven years of her life with the man—a colossal mistake, if there ever was one—but he didn’t know the first thing about her. Especially now, when her life had changed so much in such a short span of time.</p><p>“Or at least, I thought I did. Who’s this, anyway?” he asked.</p><p>Her eyes darted back to Rio, still standing in front of her, just inches away from Ralph. Though Agatha could tell she was trying to be stoic, her mouth set into a hardened line, the rapid rise and fall of her chest betrayed her. One hand held the door open, while the other was balled into a fist at her side.</p><p>Agatha watched her fingers flex like she was trying her very best not to deck him. And while she’d pay good money to see that, it probably wasn’t the best idea—unless she wanted to spend the rest of the day breaking Rio out of jail.</p><p>She sidled up next to her and wordlessly took her hand, prising her clenched fingers apart with a gentle touch. “This is Rio,” she said plainly, staring Ralph down as his eyes flickered with surprise. “My…”</p><p><em>Oh, fuck</em>.</p><p>The words died on her tongue, making it feel as heavy as lead. What to call it, how to define it—they hadn’t discussed any of it yet.</p><p>And while she wanted to so, so badly, this wasn’t the place. Calling Rio her girlfriend for the first time while her ex-boyfriend tried to break her carefully curated peace apart with his bare hands… well, they’d never be able to rewrite that moment.</p><p>“Actually, it’s none of your business,” she corrected, giving Rio’s hand a reassuring squeeze. She hoped it conveyed what she was thinking: <em>Not now, baby, but soon. He’s not worth the waste of breath.</em></p><p>Ralph just grunted at her non-answer, then pushed his way into the kitchen with a reckless confidence only straight, white, cis men had. He rounded the counter and sat down on one of the stools, looking back at them expectantly.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes found Rio right as her grip on the door fell, sending it closed behind them with a loud slam. The noise sent a stutter through Agatha’s chest, making her startle briefly before she regained control, letting the breath she didn’t know she’d been holding go with a long, slow exhale. </p><p>She took in Rio’s expression and tried to parse what was going through her head, now that Ralph had planted himself in their kitchen without a second thought. Concern, confusion, anger—they were all there, intermingling below the surface. There was something else there, too, but Agatha couldn’t quite place it.</p><p><em>Are you okay? </em>she mouthed at Rio, latching onto her intense brown gaze. Rio’s lip twisted, like she was biting the inside of her cheek, but she gave a quick, tiny nod. <em>Are you? </em>she mouthed back, her eyebrows raising in sympathy.</p><p>Agatha could feel Ralph’s eyes on them, so, no—she wasn’t okay. His scrutiny was bearing down on them both with the weight of an anvil, but she had to hold firm, to not let him see that his presence had the power to shake her.</p><p>She nodded, regained her grounding grip on Rio’s hand, and whipped back around to face him. “Why are you here, Ralph?”</p><p>He sat up taller on the barstool, puffing out his chest. Despite a glaringly obvious attempt to appear big and important, Agatha found a callous kind of pleasure in the way his feet dangled slightly above the floor. “I need to talk to you. About my child.”</p><p>She definitely didn’t hallucinate the way he looked Rio directly in the eye as he said <em>my child</em>. God, he was repulsive, repugnant, abhorrent, and every other synonym for <em>disgusting </em>she had in her vocabulary, as well as all the ones she didn’t. “Feels a little late for that, doesn’t it?” she mocked.</p><p>“I’m here now,” Ralph replied, undeterred. “And it’s important.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her bump and sighed, thinking only of the person in there. It was fierce, the maternal instinct everyone waxed lyrical about. While she didn’t want to give Ralph the time of day, she couldn’t help but feel like she had to. Giving this baby a good life meant keeping them out of harm’s way, and the only way she could do that when it came to Ralph was getting all the facts.</p><p>“Fine. Stay there,” she pointed her index finger, barking the order at him like she would a misbehaving dog. He looked at it and smirked, shoulders rising in an unbothered shrug.</p><p>Tugging Rio by the hand, Agatha hurried them into her bedroom and closed the door. As it shut, her whole body sagged. She sat down on the bed and closed her eyes, feeling the mattress dip as Rio settled beside her.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groaned, cupping her chin in one hand. “I can’t believe he just showed up like this.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly and pulled her knees into her chest, bare feet resting on the edge of the bed. “Why’s he here, do you think?”</p><p>To fuck with her. To be an ass, just because he could. To subject her to some kind of psychological warfare. All three answers were likely true, but that didn’t explain why he was here <em>now</em>. Why after months, he’d decided that <em>no</em>, he couldn’t just leave well enough alone.</p><p>“Your guess is as good as mine,” Agatha exhaled, leaning into Rio’s shoulder. She felt an arm settle firmly around her waist, tethering them together. “But I need to hear him out, whatever it’s about. I know Ralph better than I’d care to admit, and he’s not the type to just show up without an agenda.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders rose as she held in her sigh, then fell as she exhaled it through pursed lips, the arm slung around them both slackening in the process. “Okay,” she said softly. “Yeah, you should. Hear him out.”</p><p>Agatha could’ve guessed that Rio would default to acceptance. It was who she was—calm, easygoing, steady. Radiant in the sunshine, safe in a storm.</p><p>It would hurt, she realised, what she was about to ask next. But she hoped she’d understand.</p><p>“Rio, I…” Agatha turned to face her properly, voice already fraying at the edges. “I hate doing this, but… do you mind going out for a bit? While I talk to him?”</p><p>She caught the hesitance that flashed in Rio’s eyes, but pushed past it, certain that if she acknowledged it, it would only make things harder. It was better that Rio didn’t witness this—not just Ralph’s crap, but the ugliness that might spill out of her when confronted with it.</p><p>That hesitance gave way to resigned acceptance just a few seconds later.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio nodded. She stood up and brushed off invisible lint from her clothes, painting on a casual smile. “Sure. Just text me when you’re done.”</p><p>Agatha rose to her feet too, her hand finding Rio’s shoulder to give it one last reassuring squeeze. “Thank you,” she whispered, before leading them both back out the door. </p><p align="center">———</p><p>“Shut up while I make a coffee,” Agatha barked in Ralph’s direction, bustling her way back into the kitchen. He’d relocated to the living room after she and Rio had emerged from their tête-à-tête, thanks to a particularly icy, Harkness-signature glare and another jerky jab of her finger. It was nice to know that while Ralph was a stubborn ass, she could still get the jump on him, if only slightly.</p><p>She’d walked Rio to the apartment’s entrance, feeling her heart drop a little lower into her gut with every step, and pressed a grateful kiss to her temple as she left. Rio had let her, leaning into the peck with familiar ease, but that same look of careful resignation had never smoothed itself from her brow. She just offered Agatha a small smile—no more than a tight press of her lips—and an awkward wave as she stepped into the hall and waited for the elevator.</p><p>Now, mere minutes later, Agatha was standing in the kitchen with a bellyache and a throbbing head, trying to forget the expression on Rio’s face and remember how to use her Keurig again.</p><p>“Not going to offer me something to drink?” Ralph’s voice echoed from the living room.</p><p>“No,” she called sharply back.</p><p>With fumbling hands, Agatha went about the motions of fixing herself a drink, placing her mug underneath the coffeemaker and rustling through the fridge for some creamer.</p><p>The two bottles sat beside one another on the top shelf—Rio’s oat milk, then her own. Rio had taken to buying both when she did the groceries, even amidst Agatha’s reassurance that, while she was dubious about what actually went into <em>milking oats</em>, she didn’t mind the taste.</p><p>But Rio took a sweet, uncomplicated pleasure in giving her everything she wanted and needed. Even if it was just dairy-based coffee creamer in various sugar-ridden flavours she’d never be caught on record admitting she liked. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, giving her space while she bickered with her ex-boyfriend, seemingly without complaint, though her face suggested otherwise.</p><p>Agatha stared at the half-empty fridge, fingers strumming anxiously at her sides, then grabbed the oat milk creamer and added it to her coffee. She seized the steaming mug and let the burn seep into her skin, leaning into its sharp sear—anything to summon the courage to deal with the mounting problem that was currently manspreading no more than fifteen feet away.</p><p>With one last grounding breath, she adopted a mask of careful neutrality and strode into the room. She perched on the sofa across from Ralph, who’d folded into the armchair like he owned the place. (Which he certainly didn’t—she had made sure of that when she bought it, in a moment of foresight she’d thank her past self for until the end of motherfucking time.)</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, voice clipped. “Let’s talk.” Her body felt rigid against the backrest, muscles unable to relax as she preempted Ralph’s reply.</p><p>“Finally,” he grinned. Agatha scowled back, twirling her bare foot listlessly in the air. She made a <em>hurry up </em>gesture with her hands: <em>cut the shit and talk, asshole</em>. </p><p>“Look, Agatha,” Ralph began, sensing her impatience. “I shouldn’t have left when I did. I’ve been thinking that we should…” He stopped briefly, perhaps reconsidering his choice of words. “I want to get back together,” he tried again. “For the baby.”</p><p>The laugh bubbled out of her before she could swallow it, escaping wildly from her chest with the force of a stampede. Fucking pinch her, she had to be dreaming—because who did this asshole think he was? There wasn’t a universe where she’d even entertain the thought of giving Ralph a second chance. The last few months had taken good care of that, thank you very much.</p><p>“Yeah, no,” Agatha snorted, meeting her ex’s dark eyes with a glare. “That’s not happening.”</p><p>He raised an unimpressed brow, all the forced warmth he’d been putting on a second ago already evaporating into the living room air. “Cold, even for you.”</p><p>“You don’t deserve my kindness,” she replied callously, taking a sip of her coffee.</p><p>Ralph’s posture tightened. “We’re having a child together, Agatha,” he said, his voice taking on a calculated edge. “It makes sense for its parents to be together.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha scowled. “It’s not like we were ever the model of a perfect relationship. What makes you think we’d be any different now, just because there’s a kid involved?”</p><p>“We’d try harder, Agatha,” Ralph emphasised, frustration building. “You know, put our shit aside. For the greater good or whatever.”</p><p>Agatha suppressed the urge to groan so loudly, the people in the apartments five floors up would hear. “That’s a shitty reason to get back together,” she said matter-of-factly. “I’m not going to debase myself just because of your antiquated ideas about parenting. I know this might come as a shock,” she drawled, “but I don’t want to be with you. Ever again.”</p><p>Ralph’s eyes flashed with anger. “Do you really want our baby to grow up like you did?” he retorted. “Parents who don’t give a fuck? Who were too stubborn to put their differences aside?”</p><p>Agatha felt it viscerally, Ralph’s malice sliding under her ribcage and lodging itself there with a painful sharpness. Of course he’d needle at her by bringing up her parents—that was his thing. Poking and prodding until she hit back or retreated.</p><p>Towards the end of their relationship, she’d been more inclined to choose option B, preferring to sleep on the couch after an argument and ignore him the entire next day until he’d learned his lesson. It had happened more times than Agatha could count, each one a glaringly bright red flag, but she’d turned a blind eye for reasons she still couldn’t unpack.</p><p>But now? Well, now she didn’t owe him a fucking thing.</p><p>The rage burned deeply in her chest, igniting the self-preservation instincts that still lived there, even after all these years. “Don’t ever liken me to my parents,” Agatha spat out. “Ever. I’m fucking <em>nothing</em> like them,” she added, exhaling forcefully through her nose.</p><p>She wasn’t—like them, that is. Her own mother had all-but abandoned her the instant she left the womb, claiming she knew Agatha was a ‘devil child’ once she saw her scrunched-up, screaming face emerge from her body.</p><p>The disinterest and neglect in the years that followed pushed Agatha’s father away from her, too. He’d always been too insecure in his own opinions to do anything but pander to Evanora’s every wish. A coward of the first degree.</p><p>As she’d grown, they’d become more bitter and resentful. She’d gone nights without food, spent days in dirty clothes, and come home from school to an empty house for years. Just as she’d start to think they’d up and disappeared forever, her mother would return from whatever casino or bar they’d been holed up at, wielding her father’s belt to slash fresh welts into the backs of her tender, prepubescent thighs.</p><p>Even after her father had died and things between her and Evanora had changed, becoming less blatantly abusive and more driven by guilt and criticism, Agatha had assumed it was her fault. That she was evil, wicked, unloveable—all the words her mother had used against her as a child. </p><p>But the handful of years since her mother finally left the earth had created distance. Never fully enough for the wounds to heal, but enough to scab them over until she sometimes forgot they were there.</p><p>And then she’d gotten pregnant. And it had changed <em>everything</em>, right as she saw two thin lines appear on a shitty plastic test from the drugstore.</p><p>Suddenly she couldn’t rationalise it anymore, now that she had her own frame of reference. Agatha couldn’t fathom <em>ever</em> treating her child the way she’d been treated by her parents. Not in this lifetime, and not in any other.</p><p>She’d faltered here and there, letting the worries of impending motherhood seep in, but each milestone and sign of life brought her closer to the truth: she could be a good mother. Would be, even. Anything else would be a slap in the face to the tiny blessing she’d been bestowed.</p><p>Each day she renewed her promise to give her baby what she’d never had—a life full of love and joy and freedom. All the things Ralph assumed she was incapable of, when in actuality, it was him who was lacking, the fucking prick. </p><p>So, in summary—fuck him for <em>ever</em> comparing Agatha to her parents. </p><p>“If you’re going to sit there and insult me,” she hissed, still reeling, “then I suggest you take a hard look at yourself.”</p><p>Ralph held his hands up in surrender, but his eyes still glinted with something spiteful. “Sorry, forgot how touchy you can get. All I’m saying,” he said, moving along swiftly, “is that the best thing for this baby is for us to be together. To be a family.”</p><p>“Ralph, you forfeited all chances of having a family with me the second you walked out that door. And anyway, you don’t really want this,” she dismissed. “You’re just mad because I’m going on without you instead of waiting by the phone for your call. And <em>scared</em> that I’m building a better life for this baby, now that you’re not in it.”</p><p>She watched his expression morph into something even crueler, mouth turning down into an angry scowl. “Is this about her?” he bit out, jerking a finger towards the door Agatha had sent Rio through.</p><p>“Rio?” she asked. Of course he was trying to bring her into it. He needed a scapegoat, an external factor he could blame instead of, god forbid, looking inwards. </p><p>“No, it’s not about Rio,” she scoffed. Because it wasn’t—not this part, at least. This was all fucking Ralph. “It’s about you being a shitty person who abandoned me when I was 10 weeks pregnant and never looked back. A shitty person who thinks he can just compare me to my fucking <em>mother</em> and get away with it.”</p><p>“I’m here now, aren’t I?” Ralph groaned. His eyes flitted down to her stomach, visibly rounded underneath her tight t-shirt. “Look, Agatha, I’m trying,” he said, softening back up. His grip on the armchair rests eased as he continued, “I don’t want to be a deadbeat dad.”</p><p>“Well, you’re a little too late for that,” Agatha said firmly, the finality landing between them like a sinking stone. “I don’t want you here—not in my home, not in my life, and certainly not in my baby’s.”</p><p>She stood abruptly, folding her arms across her chest. Maybe that would shield the life in there from Ralph’s obtrusive gaze. Hopefully 20-week-old fetuses couldn’t hear their parents fighting.</p><p>“Agatha, we can work on this,” Ralph tried again, rising from the chair. He started walking towards her, each thudding step feeling like more of an invasion of space and privacy than the last. “I want to give our kid what it needs—what it deserves.”</p><p>Agatha recoiled as Ralph neared, praying he wouldn’t try to touch her, just in case she lost total control of her fists for a second and ended up on the receiving end of a restraining order. She held up a warning hand before he could close the gap between them.</p><p>“Don’t. I don’t need this shit,” she declared, already stomping her way back to the front door. One more minute of her ex’s pathetic pandering, and she’d surely end up doing something she regretted, which meant he needed to leave whether the conversation was truly done or not. “Fuck you, Ralph. Get out of my apartment.”</p><p>“Fine,” Ralph snarled as he followed behind, throwing his hands up in the air like she was a lost cause. “That’s fine. But don’t think for a second that I’m not getting lawyers involved once you’ve popped the kid out.”</p><p><em>Pfft</em>. He wouldn’t stand a chance if he tried—the odds were stacked firmly in her favour. She’d read up on it when he’d left, trying to get her ducks in a row for his inevitable return. </p><p>In the state of New York, Agatha wasn’t even required to put his name on the birth certificate unless he strongarmed her into signing a paternity declaration at the hospital. Which, if she somehow forgot to grace him with a phone call after the birth, he couldn’t.</p><p>“You know,” Ralph continued before she could retort, “I’m not sure the courts will take kindly to you shacking up with your little girlfriend weeks after we broke up.”</p><p>Her stomach dropped. Not because Ralph had clocked her and Rio—she didn’t give a shit if he knew they were involved, nor did she believe his baseless threats for a second. The man was too dumb to figure out how to petition for custody. He could barely file his taxes without her help.</p><p>No, the nausea curling in her gut had everything to do with the terminology he’d chosen. A word neither of them had even gotten to use yet, though she felt like the last few weeks had been building up to it. It was a harsh slap, the pure thing between her and Rio being lorded over her. Reduced to nothing more than ammo in a stupid fight with the smallest man alive.</p><p>She wanted to punch him in the face.</p><p>She wanted to kick him forcibly out onto the curb and into the next zip code.</p><p>And goddamn it, she wanted to be left to live her fucking life, the new one she’d cobbled together from the rubble of their irretrievably broken relationship, with someone who didn’t resent her for being too loud or too bossy or too much.</p><p>Someone who wanted her, cared for her… who might even love her one day, if she played her cards right. It galvanised her, that hopeful glimpse of a happy future. Just her, her baby, and Rio.</p><p>“Try me,” Agatha growled, before slamming the door in his face.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>It took Agatha longer than she’d care to admit to let Rio know the coast was clear. In her defense, she’d needed time to cool down—to quiet the tremors in her hands, relax the constriction in her jaw. So she’d poured herself a cup of ginger tea, mindful of Rio’s gentle yet frequent probing about her caffeine intake, and curled up on the couch to decompress.</p><p>As she sat there sipping the spicy liquid, Agatha revisited everything that had just unfolded. Entirely true to form, Ralph had shown up at the worst moment possible with the intention of throwing her off course.</p><p>Maybe he didn’t even want to get back together, underneath it all—it wouldn’t surprise her if it was just a symptom of his unrelenting machismo; a way to convince himself he was <em>doing the right thing</em> and <em>being a good man</em>.</p><p>Come to think of it, none of his feeble reasons for rekindling things had actually been about <em>her</em>—everything was centred around the baby. While she didn’t resent that he was finally thinking about his child, it sure as shit wasn’t a great way to make a woman feel wanted.</p><p>Although, the idea of him even wanting her anymore, especially after his earlier theatrics, brought her right back to the nauseous feeling of early pregnancy. Jesus<em>,</em> she needed a dramamine.</p><p>Swallowing thickly, Agatha fumbled over her phone’s keyboard and shot off a text to Rio, then nursed her tea and absently watched the Discovery Channel on mute. About twenty minutes later, mug empty, she heard the soft click of the front door.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha murmured. She took Rio in with a rueful smile.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio replied softly. Instead of strolling right into the living room and collapsing on the couch, she loitered in the front entrance, hands shoved into the pockets of her cargo pants. She looked at Agatha carefully. “Are you— how are you?”</p><p>“I’ve been better,” Agatha sighed, shaking her head. Without another word, she extended her arms to pull Rio into a hug, inhaling deep, grounding breaths of her perfume—cedarwood and bergamot, mixed with the fresh laundry detergent they both used. Their bodies melted together effortlessly, familiar comfort bleeding into every limb.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, sagged into one another’s hold with the apartment door hanging open, but she knew she needed it. She’d missed it, Rio’s touch, even in the short few hours they’d been apart.</p><p>“What happened with Ralph?” Rio murmured, unhooking her chin from Agatha’s shoulder. She pulled back to look at her and let her hands drop back to her sides.</p><p>“Let’s sit down,” Agatha replied, already heading towards the kitchen. She stopped in front of the sink, picking up her empty mug and depositing it in the dishwasher on autopilot. “Do you want a cup of tea? Or some water?” she called over to Rio, who’d pulled out a chair at the dining table.</p><p>Rio smiled tensely back. “No, I’m okay.”</p><p>Once Agatha had poured herself a water from the fridge, she settled at the table as well, bare elbows digging into the lacquered wood. The glass was sweating in the heat of the room—though cooler than it’d been in June or July, it was still summer, and the midday sun had its way of making the apartment feel extra stifling.</p><p>She felt the quiet spill torturously between her and Rio, not wanting to be the first to speak, but knowing she probably had to, considering she was the one with an update. The analog tick of the wall clock that’d hung in the kitchen ever since she’d moved in was the only audible sound in the room as she tried to find her words.</p><p>“Rio, I’m so sorry I asked you to leave,” Agatha finally said, pausing to let the weight of her apology land. She hoped Rio knew it wasn’t easy for her, leading with <em>I’m sorry</em>—not after decades of verbal combat, of using sarcasm and choice words as her shield.</p><p>“I just thought it would be better if I talked to him alone,” she continued. “He can be such an asshole. I didn’t want him to say something awful about you while you were there.”</p><p>“No, it’s okay. It was the right thing,” Rio acknowledged softly. Agatha reached across the table for her hand, and Rio let her. Her fingers twitched against Agatha’s; once, then twice. “What did he say?”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her belly absently with her other hand, still feeling the residue of Ralph’s ugliest barbs, and took a deep breath.</p><p>“He asked me to get back together,” she admitted. “Tried to make me feel like shit about not growing up in a stable home, like that’s in any way my fault. Gave me some sob story about how the baby would be better off if their mom and dad lived in the same house and pretended to love each other,” she finished with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>Agatha watched as something unfamiliar crossed Rio’s features. She couldn’t be sure, but it almost looked like <em>remorse</em>. That wouldn’t make any sense, though—Rio had nothing to regret. This was all Ralph’s doing, and maybe a little of Agatha’s, too, though she wouldn’t take more than ten percent of the blame. But Rio was just an innocent bystander, caught in the crossfires of their mess.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio nodded. “And?”</p><p>“And I told him to get lost,” Agatha said, the rage already thrumming in her veins again. “I don’t need his bullshit in my life,” she scoffed.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Honestly, the man’s a whackjob, I don’t know who the fuck he thinks he is,” Agatha went on, aware she’d begun to ramble but unable to stop. Anger was a powerful emotion, one she hadn’t let herself feel in quite some time, ever since she’d traded it in for softer, more delicate things.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried to cut in.</p><p>“He kept going on about family, like it was some sacred thing. Like he didn’t give that all up months ago. Seriously, Rio, he’s deluded if he thinks that I’ll just let him back in my life or the baby’s just because he finally darkened my doorstep. Without an apology, might I add, the motherfu—” </p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Her eyes flitted up, catching onto Rio’s instantly. “Yeah, babe?”</p><p>“What if he’s right?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha frowned. The gears in her head creaked to life as she processed Rio’s words, muscles stiffening protectively. Just as they’d done with Ralph, when he’d been gearing up to say something hurtful, exposing her tender, fleshy underbelly before he stuck the knife in and twisted it for good measure.</p><p>“Wait—” Agatha’s face crumpled into a frown as she reared back in her chair, pulling her hand abruptly from Rio’s. She glued it to her temple, like the pressure might hold her thoughts together.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped down to her own hands, now empty. She started to fidget, running her thumb along the inside of her ring finger with worrying speed.</p><p>“What are you saying, Rio?” Agatha questioned again. Her volume shot up unconsciously, someone else’s hand controlling the dial.</p><p>Rio’s voice was a harsh contrast to Agatha’s—quiet, resigned. “I mean, maybe you should give Ralph another shot. Be a family,” she said. “It makes more sense for the two of you to be together than… whatever this is we’re doing.”</p><p><em>Whatever this is we’re doing</em>. Fuck. “Is this because I didn’t introduce you as my girlfriend back there? Because I just wasn’t sure what we were calling it, and it felt like a weird time, and—”</p><p>“No, Agatha, it’s not that,” Rio interrupted, tilting her head back up to look at her. “It’s just, this, us—it’s so complicated. Your kid’s dad is telling you he wants to be there for you. For your baby.”</p><p>“And you don’t?” Agatha asked, eyes widening as she scrambled to fill in the blanks.</p><p>“Of course I do,” Rio urged. “I wasn’t lying when I said that. But if there’s a chance that you could be with someone who’s more stable, more capable of giving you what you need right now…” she paused. “Then don’t you think you should take it? Or at least think about it?”</p><p>“Rio, where is this coming from? Ralph’s a dick, I don’t want to be with him—or anyone else, for that matter. I want <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“I want you, too,” Rio replied softly. Sadly, like it hurt. “Maybe a little too much, if that’s even possible.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders slumped as the realisation hit her. When she spoke, her voice came out hollow. “This isn’t actually about Ralph, is it?”</p><p>“It’s about you having a family, Agatha. A real family, like you and your baby deserve.”</p><p><em>Family</em>. It hit hard in Rio’s tired voice, far more than it had with Ralph. Though Agatha hadn’t let herself say it yet—hell, she’d barely let herself think it—she knew, underneath all the trauma and fear, that it was what she wanted with the woman sitting in front of her. The one who’d taught her more about the meaning of family in a few short months than Ralph had in seven years.</p><p>Maybe it was a little crazy to long for it now, right at the start of their relationship. It was why she’d agreed taking things slow was the right approach, the best way to keep everyone safe. But if that wasn’t the endgame here—if Rio couldn’t see herself being a family with Agatha, somewhere down the line—then what were they doing?</p><p>“What about this isn’t <em>real</em> to you, Rio?” she questioned, feeling the elastic inside her brain snap. “Tell me. Because I’m extremely confused right now.”</p><p>Rio sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. “Maybe that’s the thing,” she started. She fixed her eyes on a spot behind Agatha’s head like looking directly at her was too difficult. “It all feels really fucking real, sometimes. Too real. Going to appointments with you, looking after you when you’re sick, meeting the people you care about…”</p><p>“But then in the same breath, you let your ex into our house. Entertain his bullshit. Tell me you’re perfectly fine doing this alone. It’s a lot of mixed messages, Agatha,” she continued, the hurt and frustration bleeding into her voice. It made Agatha’s lungs feel tight. “So forgive me for questioning where I’m supposed to fit in all of this.”</p><p>“I apologised for Ralph. And the other thing… I didn’t want to freak you out,” Agatha argued, activating the base instinct that had laid dormant around Rio until now—the one that told her to defend herself and fight. “It’s a lot, I <em>know </em>it’s a lot, but—”</p><p>Her voice cracked as she tapered off, a telltale waver itching in her throat. She swallowed it down with a big gulp of water.</p><p>“It’s not like I just sprung this on you, Rio,” Agatha finally continued. Her voice still shook a little, but it came out cold and detached, finely-tuned confrontation skills returning in an instant. “You knew what you were getting yourself into; pregnancy, asshole ex and all. You asked to take things slow, and I respected that. I’m still respecting that.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth tightened into a line, like she wanted to interject but was actively trying to stop herself. Agatha noticed the way her fingers dug into the flesh of her forearms, gripping them tightly at each folded elbow.</p><p>“But the fact of the matter is, I’m going to have a newborn in four months,” Agatha bit out. She sucked in a breath, feeling the tears prick at the corners of her eyes. Her mind went to the promise she’d made herself to take care of her baby, whatever the cost. </p><p>“And if you can’t be a little more ready by then, maybe there’s no point to any of this.”</p><p>She watched Rio’s eyes turn guarded as her words landed in the space between them. It was as if she’d slipped a protective film over them, blocking out their usual playful glint and replacing it with something cold and withdrawn. </p><p>“Agatha, I think—” Rio forced out, her voice hard-edged. “We should take a beat. Think about what we both want. What we’re willing to give,” she said. “And talk about this like adults once we’ve cooled down.”</p><p>She pushed away from the table with a loud scrape of her chair, then stood up. She didn’t make a move to leave, but Agatha could see the restless energy thrumming below the surface.</p><p>At that, desperation began to flood her senses. It shouldn’t have been a surprise, the way Rio was reacting—she’d led her here, after all. But god, did she have to be so unfailingly patient? So level-headed about it all?</p><p>For once, Agatha wished Rio would match her fight, even if she was fighting against her. She’d take screaming and yelling over this unsettling stoicism any day.</p><p>The panic began to roll around in her stomach, coursing through her veins, hammering a staccato beat in her ears. Everything was telling her to reach for the woman in front of her and pull her close, to give into the all-consuming gravitational pull that was making her limbs shake and her chest grow heavy.</p><p>She could apologise. Kiss it better, tell Rio it was all okay. Go back to <em>slow</em>, like nothing had changed between them. Reassure her that they’d figure it all out together, as time went by; that she didn’t have to do anything she wasn’t ready for yet.</p><p>But Agatha had never been one to cling to someone’s leg while they tried to kick her away. Not when she could sink her teeth in instead.</p><p>“You told me you didn’t spook easily,” she accused, recalling Rio’s words from the first day they’d met. At the time, they hadn’t meant much, other than offering some reassurance Rio wasn’t going to leave her high and dry with bills to pay once the baby was born. But now—well, that felt like exactly what she was doing, just with another, much thicker layer of hurt.</p><p>“Was that all a lie?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fell shut, just for a second, a frown crumpling her brow. When she opened them again, they were fierce, her nostrils flaring with frustration. “I <em>did</em> mean it, Agatha. I still do,” she urged. Disappointment deepened her voice. “But something tells me you’d do anything not to believe me right now.”</p><p>Agatha just pursed her lips in reply, the pressure turning them white.</p><p>Rio was right. She didn’t believe her. How could she, when she was doing exactly what everyone before her had done so easily? Chickening out when shit got hard. Proving to her that she <em>was </em>too much to handle. Running away, leaving her behind.</p><p>If the way Rio stood uncomfortably by the edge of the dining table wasn’t confirmation of that enough, her next words were. “Agatha, I—” she stumbled, pressing a thumb to the socket of her eye. It came away wet, but Agatha willed herself to ignore it. “I think I should go.”</p><p>“Sure,” she agreed flippantly, already resigned to the outcome. She pushed back in her own chair and dragged herself to her feet, her belly suddenly weighing a thousand tons more than usual. “Leave. Wouldn’t be a first for me.”</p><p>“Agatha, please don’t do that,” Rio sighed. She took a tentative step forward, hand reaching out, but it dropped limply back to her side before Agatha could blink.</p><p>“I’m not <em>leaving</em>, leaving. Or at least, I don’t want to. I just need some time to figure out my feelings. You could benefit from doing the same.”</p><p>The pulse in Agatha’s temples had turned into a heavy throb, pulling at the edges of her vision. Everything had begun to blur in front of her—the kitchen, Rio, their conversation. She needed out.</p><p>“I’m good,” she replied coldly. The words left her mouth with ease, like she’d rehearsed them over and over again in the mirror. “This has been enlightening enough.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>When the door swung shut for the final time that day, Agatha sank onto the floor behind it, her legs no longer capable of keeping her upright. The ticking of the wall clock reverberated around the empty kitchen, loud and pointed in the absence of any other noise.</p><p>Everything hurt. Her back, her head, her chest. The toll of not one but two emotional, trajectory-changing conversations in a single day had begun to seep into her bones.</p><p>Even with the unbearable weight of the unknown pressing down on her, though, she couldn’t let this wreck her. She still had something left to fight for. <em>Someone</em>. The reason she was in this position in the first place—the person that mattered way more than Ralph, and even more than Rio.</p><p>So she took a deep breath, placed a hand against her belly, and waited for a sign. A reminder that she wasn’t totally alone, even though it sure felt that way with Rio probably halfway to Lilia’s by now.</p><p>The minutes ticked by as she waited, jaw clenched and aching. The clock kept ticking, time moving around her nebulously. Agatha was just about to haul herself to her feet and plod to bed when it came—three little taps that made her hand and her heart stutter.</p><p>“Hey, baby,” Agatha whispered, the tears welling in her eyes as she stared down at her stomach. They dripped slowly, one by one, onto her t-shirt, staining the fabric dark. </p><p>“Mama’s here,” she choked out, skating her fingers across her bump reassuringly. “I’ve got you, love. And I promise I’m not going anywhere.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha cried herself to sleep that night. Big, gut-wrenching sobs that slipped out without permission until the well had run completely dry. She’d tried not to—lord only knew crying had been branded as a sign of weakness ever since she was small; since her mother would lock her in the fucking linen closet for it, only letting her escape once she could no longer hear her sniffles.</p><p>But lying awake as the hours ticked by, feeling the phantom press of Rio’s body against hers, Agatha was completely powerless against the tears.</p><p>So she did what any self-respecting adult who had sort of, maybe,<em> who-even-knew-anymore</em> been broken up with would do, and grabbed one of the oversized t-shirts Rio had left in her room. She slipped it on over her underwear and breathed in her scent, letting it slowly shift her brain chemistry until she was sedated enough to fall asleep, tears drying against her pillow.</p><p>The next day, it rained. An end-of-summer storm, and the first hint of wetness the city had seen since June. It felt like an omen, but Agatha tried her best to not let it sour her mood again.</p><p>It didn’t work.</p><p>Sorrow and anger vied for her attention, tugging her in one direction, then the other.</p><p>Anger, because she still couldn’t fathom how she and Rio had gone from playing happy families to crumbling underneath her fingers in the span of a twenty-minute argument. It was confusing—and not just because Rio had tried to push her into the arms of her lousy ex-boyfriend. </p><p>No, it was more to do with her dismissing everything Agatha had thought they’d been building and walking out the door without putting up a fight. The calmness, the stoicism—that was what really drew her ire. She knew how to scream and yell. She had no idea how to do <em>this</em>.</p><p>And sorrow because, well, she was sad. Deeply, bone-achingly sad, in a way she hadn’t been for a while.</p><p>Sad because Rio had left. Sad because she couldn’t figure out why. Sad, because for a split second she’d let herself believe she didn’t have to do this all alone.</p><p>The sharpness of her rage was cloaked in the dull, unexplainable throb of misery, and it made her want to claw her messy, bloody insides out.</p><p>After rolling out of bed past midday, Agatha walked around the apartment like a ghost cataloguing the remnants of her life on earth. Everything felt different without the sounds of Rio’s laugh breaking through the quiet like sunlight, or the smell of her cooking emanating from the kitchen.</p><p>She tried her hardest to put Rio out of her mind, snacking on random items from the pantry and drowning out the head noise with crappy podcasts as she watched the raindrops splatter against the windows. But she was still there.</p><p>Now, even more than before, Rio was fucking <em>everywhere</em>.</p><p>Boxers and thongs mixed amongst her own underwear in the bedroom drawer, creating a multicoloured mural of fabric that made her eyes water on sight.</p><p>Textbooks and random pieces of paper littered on the coffee table, left over from the last time Rio had studied, Agatha’s feet in her lap while she wrote her book. Rio had complained about how cold they were against the burning heat of her thighs, but when Agatha went to move them away, she’d held them there with a firm hand, drumming her fingers gently against icy toes.</p><p>Even her own reflection in the mirror reminded her of Rio. The shirt she’d stolen, the faint remnant of a hickey sucked into her inner thigh, the space between her ear and neck that Rio loved to kiss.</p><p>There was no denying it—she was in every single piece and part of Agatha, every goddamn crevice in her chest and hair on her head. In just a few months weeks, she’d filled in all the cracks left behind by her mother, by Ralph, and replaced the empty space there with something hopeful.</p><p>And then they’d gone and fucking broken it, and now, she was being forced to purge all the parts of Rio out and grieve them one by one. Whether this was a <em>break</em> or a <em>breakup</em> didn’t matter, because nothing would really change the truth—Rio didn’t want this.</p><p>She didn’t want <em>her</em>.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>The only thing that kept Agatha semi-functional those first few days was the reminder that <em>someone</em> wanted her. Or perhaps it was need, rather than want, but the notion helped all the same. Those three reassuring taps to her belly had turned into regular movements—some as soft as footsteps on carpet, but others more persistent, like a strong hand rapping on the door.</p><p>It was almost as if they knew, that tiny little person inside of her, that she needed the reassurance. Something to fortify the walls of her castle while the rest of the kingdom crumbled.</p><p>On Tuesday, the soft flutters of kicking roused her from sleep at 7am and accompanied her as she went about her morning, preparing for the doctor’s appointment jotted messily in her calendar. This one wasn’t nearly as scary as the amnio had been, but it <em>was </em>critical—her 20-week anatomy scan, only slightly overdue, where Dr Goldberg would check the baby was developing on schedule.</p><p>On the docket was an ultrasound (thankfully, not a pelvic one—those things fucking <em>sucked</em>) and, if her predictions were correct, at least half an hour of listening to her doctor yap about her advanced maternal age again.</p><p>Still, she’d get to see her baby. A pinprick of light in the seemingly unending darkness. And anything had to be better than brooding about Rio all day, wondering why she hadn’t called or texted even once—right?</p><p>Wrong. After Doctor Goldberg sailed into the room with a smarmy smile and a <em>hello, Agatha</em>, the next thing he asked was “where’s your partner today?” An unassuming question in his eyes, but a painful one in Agatha’s, all things considered.</p><p>“Left me,” she replied coldly, hiking up her shirt with a glare. Trust her doctor to press on the bruise without even realising he was doing it.</p><p>“Oh,” Goldberg fumbled, pretending to find the chart in his hands much more interesting than it actually was. He caught his breath, then looked back at her, sympathy in his gaze. “I’m very sorry to hear that.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t tell if his concern was real or fake, but she didn’t care. “Yeah, me too,” she gritted out. She patted her stomach briskly. “Now can we get on with it?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Thirty minutes passed treacherously slowly as the doctor moved the ultrasound wand over her swollen 21-week belly, pausing in different places to take photos and measurements. The room was silent, and though Agatha knew it was so he could do his job, it still unnerved her.</p><p>As Goldberg worked, her eyes flickered between the wriggling outline of a baby on the screen and his face, searching it for a hint that something might be wrong. Maybe it never went away, that protective instinct. The nosedive her stomach took at the first sign of danger, or the way her pulse would ratchet up, growing so loud it filled her ears.</p><p>Breath held, she sat and waited.</p><p>Eventually, the doctor pushed his glasses down his nose and smiled. “Well, everything’s looking good. You’ve got a very healthy little one in there, from what I can see.”</p><p>And if the fear never truly ebbed, Agatha was at least grateful that the relief had always been allowed to flow back in afterward. “Thank you,” she said, expelling her breath in a sigh. “That’s great news.”</p><p>He looked down at his chart. “Are you feeling some movement, now?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha allowed herself to smile at the memory, still bright in her mind from earlier that morning. “There’s been a few kicks.”</p><p>“Fantastic. Keep me updated if anything changes, okay?”</p><p>“Mm-hmm.”</p><p>Goldberg peered at the screen for a second, then turned back to Agatha. “Before you go, do you want to find out baby’s sex?”</p><p>“No, I told you last time—” she began, irritation flickering again under her composed surface. But before she could finish, something stopped her, like the words had been wrenched from her throat by an invisible fist.</p><p>She looked down at her belly, still smeared with cold ultrasound gel. Until now, she’d been resolute in her decision not to learn whether the baby was a boy or a girl. There were too few surprises in life, or so her justification went, and it didn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things, anyway.</p><p>But she was so fucking <em>done</em> with surprises. Perhaps if she knew a little more about who this baby would be, she’d be able to get out of her head—away from the echo of <em>Rio, Rio, Rio</em>—and back into her body.</p><p>She could prepare. Go shopping, buy some tiny, adorable clothes. Think about decorating the nursery in her apartment that she’d only recently written back into existence, though she probably wouldn’t be able to afford it once Rio inevitably turned off her rent autopayments.</p><p>Do all the things she’d been putting off for weeks, too wrapped up in a relationship that’d probably been doomed from the start.</p><p>“Actually, fine,” Agatha complied, adding a muttered “why the fuck not?” under her breath.</p><p>The doctor glanced at her with obvious surprise. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Serious as a heart attack,” she deadpanned, looking him straight in the eye. She could’ve sworn he flinched, but his back was to her before she could revel in the self-satisfaction of making a grown man squirm.</p><p>“Okay,” Goldberg nodded, already placing the ultrasound wand back on her stomach. “Just give me a second to make sure…”</p><p>Though she’d been looking at it for the last half an hour, Agatha glued her eyes to the screen and waited. Her breath hitched as the wand settled in one spot, then again as the doctor turned back around to her.</p><p>“There we go,” he announced, a smile on his face. “It’s a boy.”</p><p>Tears immediately flooded her eyes, obscuring the black and white image that constituted her entire world. “A boy?” she asked, blinking away the wetness so she could focus properly on the ultrasound. She took it all in again, chest swelling with renewed pride and awe—his head, his little nose, two miniature hands and two equally as miniature feet.</p><p>“Mm-hmm,” Goldberg said kindly. “You’re having a son. Congratulations, Agatha.”</p><p>“Shit,” she breathed, her voice unsteady with adrenaline. “Sorry, I mean— thank you.”</p><p>A fucking <em>boy</em>. This was good, Agatha realised, letting it sink in. She knew what to do with boys—she’d been around for Billy and Tommy’s entire lives, helping Wanda chase them on playgrounds in their younger days, listening to their gross jokes and ridiculous anecdotes as teens.</p><p>Maybe he’d be nothing like her godsons had been growing up, or maybe there’d be similarities so stark they’d make her smile every time she noticed them. Either outcome was good with her.</p><p>Because this was her boy. Her son. Her little victory.</p><p>Agatha managed to throw one last amazed glance at the ultrasound screen before Goldberg lifted the wand from her stomach, rendering it blank again. Even as the image faded, though, it didn’t matter—everything around her had taken on a dreamlike quality.</p><p>“Am I okay to go now?” she asked, her voice bobbing around her like it belonged to someone else.</p><p>“Of course,” the doctor replied. He shot her one last kind, reassuring smile. “I’ll see you next month. Take care, Agatha.”</p><p align="center">———</p><p>As she left the OB/GYN’s office, riding the high from seeing her son, Agatha’s mindset quickly turned determined. She’d spent the last few months wasting time—moping, then Rio, and now, more moping. But it all had to stop right here, at least for as long as she could put it off.</p><p>She caught the train back to Brooklyn from Manhattan, already plotting her next move. <em>This</em>—now this could feasibly be the solution to all her problems. Doubling down on the things she could control, and giving less credence to the things she couldn’t face just yet.</p><p>It was comforting, how a single moment could remind her that the sky wasn’t always bleak and grey, though the clouds still lingered in her peripheral vision.</p><p>Upon returning home that afternoon, Agatha bought a pregnancy pillow online, soft and squishy and moulded to the shape of another person’s body. Every article on the internet said it’d come in handy as her pregnancy progressed, when she became more uncomfortable in her body and started to find sleep difficult.</p><p>(None of them mentioned what to do when sleep already was difficult; when your mind was dead-set on keeping you up until 4am with <em>what-ifs </em>and <em>should-haves</em>. But that was beside the point. In the absence of another person’s warm body, she’d take the damn pillow.)</p><p>Over the next two days, Agatha made more of an effort to fill her life with the good stuff—the joyful stuff. She went to Barnes and Noble and picked up three books about birth and parenting, perhaps a little too afraid to interact with someone who might actually ask how she was doing, like if she went to Hart’s. She wasn’t sure what she’d say or do when presented with the illusion of care. </p><p>Then, on the first Friday since Rio had left, Agatha trained over to the massive IKEA in Red Hook and came home with a crib, dark wood and sturdy with an unpronounceable name. She carted the box back to Williamsburg in a cab, cursing her early-morning, barely-caffeinated self for deciding not to dust the cobwebs off her car and drive. It was stupid—she’d known she’d leave with at least one piece of baby furniture, yet she’d ignored her better instincts anyway.</p><p>That was shaping up to be a common occurrence. Whatever. Not relevant.</p><p>When she made it back to the apartment, twenty dollars poorer from bribing the taxi driver to help her lug the box into the elevator, she pushed it against a wall and laid down on the living room rug.</p><p>Turns out, burying your feelings under excessive amounts of productivity was exhausting. Especially when you were tasked with making a whole-ass human from scratch.</p><p>After a few long, grounding exhales, Agatha’s eyes flicked to the kitchen. They landed, inexplicably, on the flash of purple propped up against the windowsill.</p><p>It had become just another part of the scenery of her life with Rio, blending amongst the beauty of their everyday. Rio had always been the one to give it water, but now that she was gone, its thick, waxy leaves had begun to yellow. The flower, though—its heart, its centre—was still as vibrant as ever.</p><p>As she was peering at the blossoming flower of the succulent, like some giant cosmic insult, Agatha felt her phone vibrate in the pocket of her bag, dropped carelessly next to her on the floor.</p><p>Though she hadn’t heard a single peep from her in a week, her instincts told her it was Rio before she could check the caller ID. A quick glance at the screen confirmed it.</p><p>Agatha’s heart raced as the phone rang, and rang, and rang, buzzing wildly in her hand. Her thumb hovered over the button to answer it, but froze mid-air.</p><p>When the ringing finally petered out, a notification appeared. <em>Rio: 1 new voicemail.</em> She stared at it for a moment, wondering what to do. Maybe it was better to face the music now, and get it over and done with. At least it’d help her move on with her life, in one way or another.</p><p>But she couldn’t bring herself to—because what if this was it? What if Rio was just calling to say she didn’t want her anymore? The thought sent chills running through her from head to toe.</p><p>Agatha had gotten so used to living in the unknown that finality felt like the worst possible option. So, confused and exhausted, she put it off again, squeezing the side buttons of her phone until the screen turned black.</p><p>Just a little while longer.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>A knock at the front door startled Agatha out of her quiet Saturday afternoon haze, one she’d decided to spend tucked up with a pint of pistachio ice cream and a trashy reality show instead of writing or buying more baby stuff. She jolted upright as the noise came again, knocking the tub over onto the linen sheets, then cursing as a trickle of green liquid spilled out.</p><p>After hastily wiping it away with her hand, she hit pause on her laptop and covered her underwear with the floral silk robe slung over the armchair. Every hair on her body stood on end as she crept out into the hallway, hackles raised by the arrival of an uninvited visitor.</p><p>Could it be Ralph, back to rub salt in the wound again? No, surely he knew better than to cross her a second time.</p><p><em>Oh, fuck</em>—maybe it was Rio, come to relay the contents of her still-unopened voicemail in person. A pang of guilt flared in her chest, but she pushed it away faster than she’d shovelled the ice cream down her throat. She had nothing to feel guilty about. And if it <em>was</em> Rio, she only had to hear her out if she wanted to. She wasn’t past slamming the door in her face, as irritatingly gorgeous as it was.</p><p>“Who is it?” Agatha called warily, not sure of whose voice she might hear through the door. If it was a man’s, she was getting her fucking baseball bat from the hall closet.</p><p>“It’s me,” a woman’s warm trill came. <em>Wanda</em>. Her heart rate began to ease as her feet automatically carried her to the front of the apartment. She opened the door, and there was her best friend—red hair curled to perfection, a bag of groceries in either hand.</p><p>“Proof of life!” Wanda crowed, already muscling her way past Agatha and into the kitchen. “Seriously, I was starting to think you were dead. Why haven’t you been answering my messages?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her robe, then back up at Wanda, watching as concern flickered in green eyes. “I’ve been in a depressive hole in my bedroom with my phone turned off,” she replied, not bothering to couch the truth with something more palatable. This was Wanda, after all—she’d seen her at all her lowest lows. She could handle her latest version of rock bottom.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” Wanda’s tone changed in an instant, softening to a whisper. She set the bags down on the counter, then turned to place her hands on Agatha’s shoulders in a silent question.</p><p>Agatha leaned into the embrace, wrapping her arms around Wanda’s delicate frame. A tear threatened at the corner of her eye, and <em>goddamn it</em>, they were back. She’d cried more in the last week than the cumulative rest of her life, she was sure of it.</p><p>“Tell me what’s going on,” Wanda said, pulling back to rub a reassuring hand against Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“Wanda, I—” she started. Her voice broke before she could even work out where to begin.</p><p>“Okay, sit,” Wanda commanded gently, already in crisis mode. “Let me make you something to eat, and then we’ll talk.”</p><p>Agatha obediently plodded into the living room, too overwhelmed to do anything but take instructions right now. She curled herself into the familiar purple velvet of the couch, legs underneath her, and forced herself to breathe. A tear escaped like a runaway prisoner and tracked its way down her cheek until it was stopped by the sharp set of her jaw.</p><p>A few preternaturally short moments later, Wanda was thrusting a plate in her hands, laden with a grilled cheese, some carrot sticks, and a giant glob of hummus. Agatha dunked the bright orange end of a carrot into the dip, then nibbled at it, blatantly ignoring her best friend’s inquiring stare.</p><p>“Better?” Wanda questioned, sinking down onto the sofa beside her. Agatha nodded, mouth full of food. Although she’d just polished off half a tub of Häagen-Dazs, it had been days since she’d eaten a vegetable or anything resembling protein. Wanda’s unconscious mothering was, frankly, very welcome.</p><p>Her best friend let her swallow a few bites of the perfect, golden grilled cheese she’d made before resuming her line of questioning. “Agatha,” Wanda shifted closer, placing a hand on her knee. “What’s going on? You’re scaring me a little.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and dug a hand into the upholstery of the couch, suddenly feeling fidgety and a little too <em>looked at </em>for her liking. No matter how many times she’d gone over the series of events in her head, relaying it to someone aloud for the first time was always bound to be hard—even if it was in the safety of Wanda’s care.</p><p>She exhaled, casting her eyes down to the floor. The words tumbled out messily. “It’s done. Me and Rio.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Wanda’s voice was pained, like it hurt to hear just as much as it was hurting Agatha to live through it. “You broke up with her?”</p><p>“No, she broke up with me,” Agatha replied sullenly, too tired to hit back at Wanda’s assumption. It still smarted, though, because it was exactly the opposite of what she’d done in the moment. She’d stayed. She’d tried to fight. It was Rio who’d grasped for an easy out. “Well, she left. I don’t know if we actually broke up. Or if we were even officially together.”</p><p>A low whistle of surprise pierced the air.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha joked dryly around the lump in her throat. “You can say that again.”</p><p>Wanda let out a sad chuckle before her brow furrowed into an inquisitive frown. “Why’d she leave?”</p><p>The answer to that question was still murky in Agatha’s mind, hidden under layers of things unsaid.</p><p>“Ralph came barging in, back on his usual bullshit. Trying to get back together. I told him no, because I’m not <em>insane</em>. But Rio…” she gulped another breath. “The whole thing freaked her out. She said we should try to be a family. Me and,” she shuddered, “Ralph.”</p><p>“What the fuck,” Wanda muttered, blinking in confusion. “That’s… stupid. Misguided. Idiotic, really.”</p><p>“She’s an idiot,” Agatha agreed bluntly. “But, I don’t know,” she shook her head. “I don’t think she really meant it. It seemed like it was more about her than it was about him.”</p><p>It had become clearer the more she replayed their conversation, running over every choice of word and inflection in Rio’s voice. The stumbles, the hesitation. The way she’d reached for her, then thought better of it.</p><p>Maybe Rio hadn’t intentionally tried to hurt her—but by holding something back, by not trusting Agatha enough to handle the full story, she had anyway.</p><p>“I’m <em>so</em> <em>angry</em> at her,” she emphasised, her voice already growing thin and hoarse. “But it also feels wrong that she’s not here.” Her lip trembled. “Is it weird that I just want her here?”</p><p>“No, it’s not,” Wanda shushed, patting Agatha’s shoulder. She let herself melt into the touch again, wondering when she’d become so normal about physical affection.</p><p>“Honey, I don’t know what to say. If it was anyone else but Rio,” her best friend continued, running a hand through her hug-mussed hair, “I’d tell you to move the hell on and rebuild. Maybe text them one final <em>fuck you</em>. But I don’t think that’s the right answer, and it’s probably not the one you want to hear, either.”</p><p>Agatha took in Wanda’s expression—knowing, empathetic. She’d always been able to read her like a book. The only one who’d seen through her facades, ever since she was a kid pretending that <em>yes, Mrs Maximoff, my mother did</em> <em>feed me dinner before I left the house</em>. <em>I’m just extra-hungry tonight</em>. <em>Your meatloaf is </em>that<em> good</em>.</p><p>This time wasn’t any different, though they’d done a lot of growing up since then. Wanda wasn’t invalidating the anger that had bubbled up to the surface—but she could see the things still lurking underneath it clearer than anyone else.</p><p>“It’s not like I have much choice,” Agatha said, slumping back against the couch. She took another bite of her sandwich, the coagulating cheese sticking uncomfortably to the roof of her mouth.</p><p>“Have you talked to her? Texted?” Wanda stole a carrot stick off Agatha’s plate and swiped it through the hummus, crunching loudly while she waited for an answer.</p><p>“No,” Agatha mumbled. “She left me a voicemail yesterday, but I haven’t listened to it yet. I just,” she squeezed her eyes shut, preempting the sting of saying it out loud. “I can’t handle another rejection.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips turned down dubiously. “How do you know she’ll reject you?”</p><p>“She’s the one who left <em>me</em>, Wanda. The baby, being together… she made it pretty clear it’s too much for her right now.”</p><p>“She said that?”</p><p>“I think the exact phrasing she used was, <em>I need to figure out my feelings</em>.” Agatha couldn’t help but roll her eyes as she recounted Rio’s words and how they had gotten under her skin so easily.</p><p>“Well, that’s not particularly conclusive evidence,” Wanda reasoned. She grabbed Agatha’s plate and rested it on the coffee table in front of them without looking, eyes still fixed firmly on her as she continued. “Do you want supportive best friend Wanda right now, or voice of reason Dr Maximoff?”</p><p>“I don’t have my checkbook handy, if that’s what you’re asking,” Agatha scoffed, deflecting. Wanda just raised an eyebrow, waiting for her to respond with something other than a barb.</p><p>She looked down at her belly and away from Wanda’s prying eyes. It went against everything she’d told herself over the last week, but she couldn’t pretend anymore—the thread was still there, pulling tighter and tighter with every lonely hour that passed.</p><p>She missed Rio. She wanted Rio. She needed Rio. </p><p>Maybe Wanda’s advice would give her the push she needed to actually do something about it.</p><p>“Voice of reason,” she groaned quietly.</p><p>“Well, then,” Wanda said, “I think talking it out could be good. Give Rio a chance to apologise… to explain where she was coming from with the whole Ralph thing.”</p><p>“It’s not even about Ralph, anymore, Wanda,” Agatha replied wearily. “It’s about her being too shit-scared to be honest with me.”</p><p>“Being scared isn’t a bad thing,” Wanda said, her hand rubbing soothingly against Agatha’s knee. “I know she went about it wrong, I’m not going to dispute that. But this is the first time she’s messed up. She’s been eerily perfect up ‘til now. The other shoe had to drop sometime.”</p><p>“But I’m scared <em>too</em>,” Agatha protested, her voice pitching up into a whine. “I had hundreds of opportunities to run for the hills, but I didn’t.” </p><p>“I hear that, honey. And it’s gotta cut particularly deeply coming from Rio.”</p><p>Deep? No, the blade had sliced clean through her. She pressed the heel of her hand to one eye, frustration inciting tears again. “I’m just so fucking sick of people abandoning me, right when things get hard.”</p><p>“I know. You don’t deserve that.” Wanda paused and looked at her like she was about to say something Agatha would hate. After a moment, she spoke tentatively. “But how much have you actually discussed it? Like, what happens when the baby’s born?”</p><p>“Only a little, I suppose,” she acknowledged. “I didn’t want to push her. She said she needed some time, wanted to take things slowly.”</p><p>“Did you ever tell her what <em>you </em>wanted?”</p><p>“I guess—” Agatha hesitated. Had she? She racked her brain, combing over the few real conversations they’d had about the baby, about what happened when two turned into three. </p><p>She’d asked. Rio had deflected. She’d tried again, and Rio had asked to take things slow. And then Ralph had shown up and ruined it.</p><p>But amongst it all, maybe—just <em>maybe</em>—Agatha could’ve been a little more forthcoming with her own feelings. She bit her lip. “Not really, no.”</p><p>“Well, maybe that’s a good start, then,” Wanda encouraged kindly. “Talk to her. I don’t think I could sit back and watch this fall apart without you both laying everything on the table.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and let the words wash over her. Wanda was right—talking was the logical next move. But she hadn’t cleared enough space in her head for logic just yet.</p><p>She folded her arms and schooled her expression into something neutral, desperate for a little relief. “Okay, new topic. Tell me what’s going on with you,” she asked. “I need to take my mind off things.”</p><p>Wanda hummed and rolled her eyes. “Fine,” she eventually relented. Clearly she knew her best friend’s limits—perhaps even better than Agatha did herself. “I actually do have some news of my own. It’s not bad, entirely, but it’s big.”</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked, her brows drawing together instantly.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. The boys are fine, too. No need to worry,” she said lightly. “It’s me and Vision, we’re separating.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha gasped. She reached for her best friend’s hand and surveyed her face for signs of despondency, of remorse, of anger. She didn’t find any—Wanda just wore a small, wan smile. “I’m sorry,” she frowned. “That’s… extremely shitty.”</p><p>“Mmm, it is and it isn’t. It was a joint decision. We’ve been together so long, and we’re just not… happy.”</p><p>“How’d you come to that realisation?”</p><p>“There were a lot of little things that added up for me,” Wanda said. She cast her eyes down her hands and began to pick at one red-manicured fingernail. “I know you won’t like hearing this, but one of them was actually, uh, you and Rio.”</p><p>“Huh?” Agatha blinked. That couldn’t be right—her relationship with Rio had lasted all of six weeks. Wanda had barely seen them together, other than at her Fourth barbecue and the one time she’d dropped by on her way back from a meeting in the city. She’d stayed a grand total of thirty minutes, engaging in idle chatter with them over coffee before heading back home to Westview.</p><p>“I don’t know, it just got me thinking. I haven’t felt wanted in a really long time, not the way you guys seemed to want each other,” Wanda confessed. “Like, that intense, can’t keep your hands off each other kinda connection.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes dropped closed. They <em>had</em> had that, the connection. One they’d both tried to name or explain a million times, but never really could. If it wasn’t totally absurd, Agatha would wonder whether Wanda was manufacturing her own life trauma just to get through to her about Rio.</p><p>“Vis is a great dad, and a wonderful person. A wonderful husband, even,” Wanda continued. “But somewhere between having twins and moving back to the suburbs, our spark just… disappeared.”</p><p>She bit her lip and sighed. Though, for all intents and purposes, Wanda seemed fine, her voice was still fraying with exhaustion. “I thought about trying to patch it up, go to sex therapy or something, but my heart wasn’t really in it. The boys are grown, they’re headed off to college next year. So we just decided to call time on it.”</p><p>“That makes sense,” Agatha admitted. She’d never really been that convinced by the whole Wanda and Vision thing—sure, the guy was kind and solid, and it was clear he’d do anything for his wife and the boys. All good traits for a dad, traits that her kid’s father surely didn’t possess.</p><p>But if she looked back on it, they weren’t the picture of <em>romance</em>. Or passion. Agatha mightn’t have been able to fully grasp it before Rio, but now, it clicked too easily.</p><p>“I wish I’d known that you were feeling that way,” she murmured. She brushed her thumb over the back of Wanda’s knuckles, hands still loosely linked between them on the couch.</p><p>“We had to work through it ourselves, first,” Wanda reassured her. “And I knew you’d be there for me in a pinch when I needed it.”</p><p>“And that’s now?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda smiled gently. “That’s now.”</p><p>“Guess we can navigate whatever this is together.”</p><p>“We could,” she agreed, nodding. “And we will, if it comes to that.” Agatha braced herself for the <em>but</em>. “But forgive me for still holding out a little hope.”</p><p>Agatha sagged back against the couch, posture crippled by the heaviness of everything she’d worked through in the last few months—all there was left to still work through, if she took Wanda’s advice and heard Rio out. The more she thought about it, the more she wanted to, but that didn’t just erase the fear.</p><p>“Same,” she admitted sadly. Her voice came out husky again, like even mentioning Rio had the power to suck all the air from her lungs. “I don’t even know how to properly be mad at her. And trust me, I’ve tried.”</p><p>Wanda hummed. “You don’t have to text her right this minute. But think about it, okay?”</p><p>“Sure,” she dismissed, though the platitude weighed guiltily on her tongue. “So, you gonna give dating women a try again now that you’re a free bird?”</p><p>“Funny you should mention that,” Wanda replied sheepishly. “I, uh, might’ve already dipped my toe back in.”</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to be overcome with surprise. “What?” she practically screeched, shooting up from the couch with the energy of a much sprightlier, much less pregnant woman. “Wanda Jane Maximoff! You’ve been separated for like two seconds! When did you even find the time?”</p><p>“Sit down, you idiot,” Wanda chastised softly, her shoulders shaking with laughter. Agatha let herself be tugged onto the couch, but only because the sudden movement had sent the blood rushing to her head, making her dizzy. Once the earth was a little more stable on its axis, she looked pointedly at her best friend and folded her arms.</p><p>“It happened when I was in California,” Wanda said. “Vis and I were already crumbling, then, so we agreed to try dating other people. Test things out before we committed.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And I saw Nat, when I went to San Francisco.”</p><p>“Nat…” Agatha crinkled her nose, trying to place the name in the context of Wanda’s trip away. “Wait, you told me you were visiting a friend after the conference. Who the hell is Nat?”</p><p>A smile played on Wanda’s lips, threatening the corners of her mouth like she had no control over its arrival. “The girl I told you about,” she said. “From college.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s so fucking gay of you,” Agatha laughed, her expression animated again. “Rekindling a flame from twenty years ago?”</p><p>“Excuse me,” Wanda replied indignantly, her brows flying up. “You’ve been out for all of two seconds! You don’t get to accuse me of being a stereotype.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha promised, but there was still a grin plastered across her face. “It’s just very funny to me. I appreciate you conjuring some entertainment in my time of need.”</p><p>“Anyway,” Wanda looked at her with exasperation, trying to steer the conversation back on course. “It never really <em>flamed</em> the first go around. But this time…” her expression grew softer, “I think there’s something there.”</p><p>Agatha had to hold back an extremely out-of-character <em>aww</em>. It was nice, seeing her best friend light up about something—something that was entirely hers. Not about the kids, not about Vis, not about Agatha. “So, when are you gonna see her again?” she asked.</p><p>“She’s coming to New York in a few weeks, actually. Scouting out a couple of the hospitals there. She’s a doctor.”</p><p>“An upgrade from whatever boring job Vision does, I’ll give you that.” Agatha had never truly grasped the specifics of Wanda’s husband’s job—something to do with computers. Or, like, buildings… engineering? No, that wasn’t it. Definitely computers.</p><p>“Well, I expect updates,” she went on. “Morning after updates included.”</p><p>Wanda hummed thoughtfully. “I suppose fair is fair.”</p><p>“Vis isn’t gonna know what’s hit him,” Agatha mused, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, I already told him. We’re being very adult about it. I still love him, he still loves me. Just differently—as friends. As coparents.”</p><p>God, that’d be nice. Agatha wasn’t sure she’d ever get to as good a place with Ralph—whether she could ever bring herself to <em>want </em>to. “Wouldn’t expect anything less from the therapist of the year.”</p><p>Wanda huffed a laugh before easing up off the couch and to her feet. “Okay, I’ve gotta go. Tommy’s got football practice and his shitbox car broke down,” she said, pulling her bag onto her shoulder. “It’s gonna take me at least an hour to get back to Westview, and teenagers don’t take kindly to waiting around for their moms to pick them up.”</p><p>“Wait, before you leave,” Agatha stood and grabbed hold of Wanda’s wrist. “Put your hand out and close your eyes,” she said cryptically, then disappeared as quickly as she could into her bedroom. She found what she needed on the dresser and returned to the living room, placing the printout in her best friend’s outstretched hand.</p><p>“Open,” she said, nudging Wanda’s arm. Green eyes opened and latched curiously onto the ultrasound. “It’s a present for you. From your nephew, or whatever.”</p><p>Her best friend looked back at her, eyes already shining with unshed tears, and grinned. “Oh my god, a <em>boy</em>,” she said, before letting out a beleaguered groan. “Not another one,” she slapped a hand to her forehead. “God, you’re so in for it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha chuckled, a matching smile spreading across her face. “Okay, go get that kid of yours.”</p><p>Wanda slipped the picture into her pocket, then gave Agatha’s shoulder a squeeze. “Love you, honey,” she waved, already heading towards the door.</p><p>Agatha expected Wanda to have turned around by the time she reached the kitchen, armed with some wise parting words about Rio and what to do. But she didn’t, instead just letting the front door close behind her with a soft click.</p><p align="center">———</p><p>After a healthy serving of the lasagne she’d found hidden in her fridge—fuck, Wanda was a godsend—Agatha did what she seemed to be best at lately, and took herself to bed.</p><p>She lay there in another one of Rio’s t-shirts, pilfered from the dresser in her room this time, and tried the same tactics that had proven so useful over the past week. Breathe. Compartmentalize. Think about literally anything else.</p><p>The ceiling fan whirred. The New York traffic outside her window buzzed. The lamp on one bedside table flickered—yet another home improvement project she needed to tackle, and likely wouldn’t. </p><p>Yet Agatha couldn’t tear her focus from Rio.</p><p>She’d been so <em>good</em>, the last few days. Sure, Rio had entered her mind—every hour on the hour, if she was being honest—but she’d assumed the tight grip of her spiral had lessened.</p><p>Clearly the rats had been steadily chewing at the wires of her brain without her permission, and now one had snapped. Her fingers itched against the smooth case of her phone like nothing had changed.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, turned it back on, and pressed play on her most recent voicemail. And fuck if the sound of Rio’s voice didn’t immediately bring tears to her eyes.</p><p>“Hey, ba— Agatha. It’s me. I… miss you. I meant it when I said I just needed some time to think, but I’ve done that now, and I’d really like to talk, when you’re ready.”</p><p>Agatha heard Rio’s usually steady inflection crack with something foreign. She realised, too suddenly, that in all their weeks of living together, she’d never heard or seen Rio cry—nothing beyond the slight well of tears in her eyes the very last time they’d spoken. But now, the unbridled emotion bleeding into her tone was obvious.</p><p>“I think I’ve already said this,” a soft, sad chuckle came down the line, “but I miss you. Please call me. I have a lot I need to say, and I’d be really grateful if you heard me out. Okay, uh, bye.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, freeing her own tears so they trailed down her cheeks and onto the fabric of her shirt. After talking with Wanda, she hadn’t been sure what to expect from the voicemail—the fear of rejection had held strong, but a little hope had filtered back in, too. And now that hope had legs.</p><p>Rio’s words resounded in her ears: <em>I miss you</em>. <em>I’ve thought about it. I’d like to talk</em>. She shuffled down the bed to lay flat and closed her eyes, the wetness of her lashes fanning her cheeks.</p><p>Up until now, she’d been keeping the visions at arm’s length, too distraught to entertain them—too convinced they’d never come true with the way she and Rio had left things. But now, eyes squeezed shut, they escaped from the confines of her mind with startling force.</p><p>Rio rocking a newborn in her arms, a hospital tag still on one chubby ankle.</p><p>The two of them half-asleep on the couch, the baby tucked into her chest while she stroked an absentminded, gentle hand across his back.</p><p>An unruly toddler climbing into bed with them way too late in the night, mumbling about a nightmare as Rio sleepily took him into her arms and brushed the tears away from his eyes.</p><p>The first steps and the first day at school and when they took him to fucking <em>college</em>, 18 years from now when Agatha’s hair had long turned grey at the roots and Rio’s smile was framed by the lines of almost two decades well-spent.</p><p>It had taken a lot of unspoken feelings and Rio’s untimely departure for her to truly figure it out, but Agatha knew what she wanted.</p><p>There was still a possibility Rio didn’t want the same thing; that she’d stay resolute in her decision. But she had to take a chance—because beneath the sadness, beneath her shitty excuse for anger, something in her was screaming <em>it’s not over yet</em>.</p><p>No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t purge Rio out. Not, at least, without a conversation.</p><p>So she caved and sent the text.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b><em>Let’s talk. Tomorrow. Send me your address.</em></p>

<p><span>Of all the people Agatha had expected Lilia Calderu to be, the woman who opened the door—well, she ticked every single box. Rio had described her perfectly, from the curly grey tendrils escaping from her bun, held together by what looked to be a charcoal pencil, down to her swishy skirt and silver-bangle-laden arms.</span></p><p><span>Standing in the doorway, Agatha simply stared at her for a moment before tightly clasping her hands behind her back to stop herself from fidgeting. Her bag hung from one wrist, car keys clattering around inside. “Hello,” she said tightly.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha!” Lilia greeted, wasting no time in sweeping her into a hug that smelled strongly of incense, with undertones of freshly baked bread.</span></p><p><span>She stiffened under the foreign touch, but after a brief moment of being held, she found herself drooping—if ever-so-slightly—into the embrace. She deposited her bag on the floor with one hug-restricted hand and leaned in a little, an arm instinctively wrapping around Lilia’s shoulders.</span></p><p><span>If Agatha hadn’t been too preoccupied by her reason for being in Lilia’s apartment in the first place, the motherly warmth of her presence might’ve felt almost nice—yet it was overshadowed by the idea of Rio somewhere down the hall, mind full of thoughts and decisions</span> <span>she wasn’t privy to.</span></p><p><span>The morning, though brief, had been the ultimate test of Agatha’s newly acquired self-regulation techniques. She’d woken with the sun before 7am, now used to leaving her bedroom blinds cracked, and gone straight into action mode—showering, getting dressed, and force-feeding herself cereal and coffee before clambering into her car for a 45-minute drive to the Bronx.</span></p><p><span>As she hummed along to whatever annoyingly eclectic daylist Spotify had made for her, her mind had predictably raced—but at every stoplight and section of predictable New York gridlock, she’d found her reflection in the rear-view mirror and steeled herself.</span></p><p><span>She could do this. No, she </span><em><span>had</span></em><span> to do this. The only way out was through.</span></p><p><span>“It’s lovely to meet you. I just made tea,” Lilia said warmly, pulling back from the hug.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed, arranging her lips into a noncommittal twist that she knew was probably more pained grimace than tentative smile. A cup of tea at any other time would’ve been a welcome comfort, but she wasn’t sure sitting and waiting would do her jitters any good. She’d come for one thing, and one thing only—to hear Rio out.</span></p><p><span>“Is she here?” she asked. </span><em><span>Jesus</span></em><span>, where did that tremor in her voice come from? She’d barely made it across the fucking threshold, and she was already doing her best impression of a leaf shaking in the breeze.</span></p><p><span>“She is,” Lilia replied, then ushered Agatha into the kitchen with a wave of her hand. Dutifully, she collected her bag and followed, taking in her surroundings.</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s apartment was warm and lived-in, with mismatched throws and cushions on every soft surface and not a single regard for a set colour scheme. It was also, if she had to hazard a guess, rent-controlled. Agatha knew from what Rio had told her that Lilia was a native New Yorker and long retired, now content to live off the unreliable takings from her various hobbies—but this place was surely too big and nice for her to afford without a handy loyalty discount. The lucky bitch.</span></p><p><span>“Uh,” Agatha made an awkward noise, watching while Lilia fiddled over two cups and a pot of loose-leaf herbal tea.</span></p><p><span>“Rio’s in her room,” the older woman said, back still turned to Agatha. What was she, a fucking clairvoyant? “She’s been a little sick these past few days.”</span></p><p><em><span>Sick, huh</span></em><span>? That was one way to put it. “I see,” Agatha replied in a clipped voice. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, wondering what to do with herself.  “Can I…”</span></p><p><span>Lilia spun back around as Agatha trailed off, her dress billowing with the movement. “Come sit with me first,” she requested, nodding towards the living room and its two patchwork blanket-covered sofas. Steam rose from the teacups she clutched in either hand, evaporating into the apartment’s tepid air as she crossed the kitchen tiles.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stifled a groan. There didn’t seem to be a way out of this one—she was already realising Lilia’s questions served more as statements. “Sure,” she nodded curtly, trailing behind.</span></p><p><span>Once they were seated across from each other, Agatha nursed a cup of tea that tasted like it had come directly from a tree (but Lilia vehemently insisted was pregnancy-safe) and tried to relax her jumpy muscles. She took a long, slow sip and found inquisitive brown eyes watching her over the rim of matching china.</span></p><p><span>“I’m very happy to finally put a face to the name,” Lilia said. Her bare feet were tucked up onto the couch, and Agatha caught a flash of teal-painted toenails disappearing beneath flowy skirts.</span></p><p><span>She blinked, registering Lilia’s words a second too slowly. “She told you about me?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, of course, dear,” Lilia remarked, lifting an eyebrow. “I had to get my friends down at the precinct to run a background check on the woman I was sending her off to live with, now, didn’t I?”</span></p><p><span>Obviously Lilia was in with the feds. God, it was all so </span><em><span>New York</span></em><span>. On any other day, in any other timeline, Agatha would’ve whipped out a journal or her phone to start taking character notes for her next novel.</span></p><p><span>“Is that all?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Lilia said lightly. “Rio told me… well, everything, I think. Though I’m not naive. I know there are two sides to every story.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Agatha said, voice distant and echoing in the wide, open living room. She wondered what Rio had told her foster mom about the past week, and if she’d painted her in a tragic light, or saved that honour for herself.</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s eyes landed on Agatha’s stomach, protruding more than usual under the last few buttons of her linen shirt. Another one for the post-baby pile. “How many weeks are you now?” she asked, smiling fondly.</span></p><p><span>“Uh, 21.” She shifted in place, the heavy, lumpy cushions of the couch already doing a number on her back. “Just over halfway there.”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Lilia murmured wisely. “Must be feeling pretty real.”</span></p><p><span>“It is.” She held back the bitter aside that popped into her head—</span><em><span>more real now that I might be doing this totally alone</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s expression must’ve betrayed her discomfort, because before she could add anything else, Lilia was changing the topic. “Can I get you something to eat? I’ve never been pregnant myself, but I lived with my sister when she was expecting her first. I don’t think I stopped cooking for nine months,” she chuckled.</span></p><p><span>“No, I’m okay.” Agatha took another sip of tea, forcing a tight-lipped smile onto her face.</span></p><p><span>“Suit yourself.”</span></p><p><span>They sat in silence for a few minutes, the only audible sounds the clink of porcelain and the growing hum of traffic outside. Lilia’s apartment was just off Grand Concourse, close to Yankee Stadium, and it was a Sunday morning. Though Agatha had been up for hours, the city was only just stuttering into motion. She absentmindedly hoped the rest of New York was having a better start to the day than her.</span></p><p><span>As she drained the last dregs of her tea, a few leaves still clinging to the bottom of the cup, Agatha’s awareness drifted—as it almost always did, these days—to Rio. Here she was, sitting and drinking tea like everything was fucking normal when the person she wanted to see most in the world sat in another room, oblivious to her presence.</span></p><p><span>“I, uh, didn’t tell her what time I was coming over,” she said, setting her cup on the table. She started to haul herself to her feet, impatient to get whatever came next underway—because the sooner she spoke to Rio, the sooner she’d have answers. “So I should probably—”</span></p><p><span>“Wait,” Lilia interjected. The command was kind but firm. “Before you go in there, I wanted to ask you something.”</span></p><p><span>A few months ago, Agatha probably wouldn’t have heeded the request. Hell, she would’ve already stormed through the apartment banging on every goddamn door until she could find Rio and rip her a new one for leaving.</span></p><p><span>But maybe it was the softness in Lilia’s expression that made her obediently sit back down like a naughty child. She supposed it wouldn’t hurt to give the old kook an audience.</span></p><p><span>The older woman shuffled so her feet were on the floor, a hand resting against her knees like she was gearing up to deliver important news.</span></p><p><span>“I know you’re probably angry at Rio, and from what she’s said to me, you have every right to be. But—” Lilia stopped herself with a shake of her head. “Go easy on her, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed a breath out of her nose, already feeling indignant. She wasn’t sure what irked her more—Lilia’s plea, or the insinuation that she’d go in there and yell in Rio’s face. Maybe she would, but that was her fucking prerogative. She wasn’t the one who’d run away, who’d disappeared for a week with barely a word.</span></p><p><span>She folded her arms and stared coolly at Lilia. “Why?” she challenged, feeling the fight beginning to stir low in her gut.</span></p><p><span>Lilia didn’t seem fazed by the sudden shift in Agatha’s demeanour. “Rio’s more guarded than she lets on,” she explained, lips pressing together into a thin line. “She feels things deeply, but she doesn’t like to show it. I think she’s a little scared of having something good in her life in case it gets taken away from her.”</span></p><p><span>The choice of words prickled at Agatha’s chest. </span><em><span>Scared</span></em><span>. It wasn’t new information—she was smart enough (and paid enough attention to Wanda) to have already connected those glaringly obvious dots. But Lilia was hinting at a deeper reason, something more painfully entrenched than a spur-of-the-moment freakout.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s brow furrowed, curiosity flaring underneath irritation. “Why is that?”</span></p><p><span>A contemplative look crossed Lilia’s face. “Rio has… history. A </span><em><span>complicated</span></em> <em><span>backstory</span></em><span>, as a writer like yourself might say,” she said. Agatha had to bite back a dry snort at the ridiculous flourish she made with one hand, fingers curling with the theatrical flair of a bad high school drama teacher. “You know she was in foster care before she came to me?”</span></p><p><span>“I do,” Agatha nodded tersely.</span></p><p><span>“How much has she told you about before? About her mother?”</span></p><p><span>She thought back to the few mentions of Rio’s mom from the past few months. They’d always been brief—sincere but stilted, like she was keeping the painful parts in shadow so no one else could see. “Only a little,” she said with a detached shrug. “Just that she was all she had, and that she died when she was a teenager.”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Lilia considered. Something in her eyes told Agatha that she’d known this was the case—that she knew the full picture hadn’t yet come into view. “There’s a bit more to it than that.”</span></p><p><span>It didn’t alleviate the undercurrent of frustration thrumming in Agatha’s veins, but it slowed it a little, punctuating each spike with space to breathe. So, perhaps against all better judgment, she unfolded her arms and listened.</span></p><p><span>“Isabela was sick for a lot of Rio’s childhood,” Lilia began, setting her own tea cup on the table with a sigh. “It was always just the two of them, holed up in a tiny apartment in Queens. They didn’t have anyone else. Rio’s dad was never in the picture, and her abuela couldn’t leave Puerto Rico.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded along at the mention of Rio’s grandmother, recalling the way her features grew fond when she talked about her, though that was just as rare as any mention of family.</span></p><p><span>“By the time Rio was ten or eleven, she’d gotten pretty unwell. Isabela had a few friends, and from what the social worker could tell me, they did their best to support them both through it,” Lilia continued. “But most of them were immigrants, too. They had their own kids and jobs and busy lives to deal with.”</span></p><p><span>“So Rio, as young as she was, did the lion’s share. Cooking, cleaning the apartment, getting prescriptions from the pharmacy,” she listed, ticking each invisible item off against a ring-laden finger. Her voice turned melancholy. “She was practically her mother’s caretaker in those last few years.”</span></p><p><span>The image knocked the wind out of Agatha, cutting straight through all of her defenses—a young Rio, barely on the cusp of adolescence, carrying such a heavy load.</span></p><p><span>They had that in common, but it hurt far more to picture Rio’s burden than it did to recall her own.</span></p><p><span>Any love Agatha might’ve had for her parents had faded, faster and faster, as she grew up and they continued to disappoint her. Or betray her, more accurately. As an adult, she’d kept her mother in her life out of obligation—and fear, if she looked back on it now. When Evanora had died, the dominant emotion she’d felt was relief, not grief or sorrow.</span></p><p><span>But the love between Rio and her mother had been steady and strong, until it was pried from her grasp by life’s cruel hand. She thought back to their first date in the park, when Rio had said her mom was her favourite person.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had never had a favourite person before—until Rio had won the title without even trying. So why had she thrown it all away? If Rio knew the pain of being left by her mother—what possible reason could there be for doing the same thing to her and her child?</span></p><p><span>“Are you okay, Agatha?” Lilia’s voice echoed in her ears, and Agatha realised she’d screwed her eyes tightly shut.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” she husked out, focusing on the woman in front of her again. Lilia was looking at her with a mixture of curiosity and concern, brows loosely knitted together. “Keep going.”</span></p><p><span>“I was just saying, I don’t even want to think about how much school Rio would’ve missed back then. It’s a miracle CPS didn’t get involved until just before Isabela died,” Lilia supplied. The set of her mouth faltered. “Or maybe a tragedy, depending on how you look at it.”</span></p><p><span>“Why didn’t she get help?” Agatha asked faintly. She drew in a breath and squared her shoulders, trying to sharpen her reaction again, but it was no use. Her complex feelings towards Rio were bleeding through like ink onto paper.</span></p><p><span>“That I’m not sure of. Pride, maybe. Or fear,” Lilia pondered. “Obviously, I never met her, but from what I’ve managed to get out of Rio over the years, she was fiercely independent before she got sick. I don’t suspect that would be an easy thing to let go of.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded slowly, feeling her body sink further into the couch.</span></p><p><span>“When she came to me, Rio had been bounced around to over ten foster homes in two years. Some of them were assholes, plain and simple—just trying to make a buck,” Lilia sucked her teeth, clearly incensed by the memory. “Others didn’t really know what to do with her. All that trauma at such a young age.”</span></p><p><span>“There was a whole period where she just… didn’t talk, according to the social worker. Supposedly they tried a household where someone spoke Spanish, but even then she’d barely say a word. And then she landed on my doorstep,” the older woman said plainly.</span></p><p><span>“She was fifteen, combative, barely functioning. The only things she wanted to do were play basketball, listen to loud music, and probably drink in a back alley somewhere with her friends, if my suspicions at the time were correct.”</span></p><p><span>A quiet laugh left Agatha’s chest like a small reprieve. Lilia’s version of events was almost identical to the one Rio had given her the night she’d had Jen and Alice over for dinner. God, that felt like a lifetime ago.</span></p><p><span>“It took her so long to warm up to me,” Lilia added, reminiscing. “But we got there eventually.”</span></p><p><span>“How’d you get through to her?”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t give up,” Lilia shrugged. “Patience. Persistence. Forgiveness. Those qualities work wonders with someone whose entire life has been coloured by grief.”</span></p><p><span>“You make it sound so easy,” Agatha sighed. She raked a hand tiredly through her hair. “I’m not sure it is, though.”</span></p><p><span>“Look, Agatha,” Lilia said, fixing her with a grave look. “Rio can get all the therapy she wants, and say she’s healed, but at the end of the day, she’s still a scared kid trying to anticipate when her mom would leave her behind. Unfortunately, that doesn’t just go away.”</span></p><p><span>She picked up her teacup from the table and looked at it thoughtfully, rolling the pristine china around in her hand. “Rio’s a protector by nature. Call it a learned behaviour, from all those years of caring for her mom. I’m sure she wants nothing more than to protect you and that little one of yours.” She gestured to Agatha’s bump, and Agatha looked down, noticing how she’d unconsciously begun to cradle it in her hands.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to dispute Lilia’s suggestion, but the sentiment died in her throat.  Because it felt true. Or it had, until a week ago.</span></p><p><span>Rio had swooped in and collected all the pieces of a broken woman who’d thought her heart was near-barren, putting them back together with simple gestures and encouraging smiles. Against her better judgment, Agatha had let her, feeling the tight hold of being cared for wrap around them like a vine. Not just her, but her son, too. </span></p><p><span>That’s why it had hurt so much—why it still hurt so much—that after everything, after building up Agatha’s trust in painstaking increments, she’d just tapped out. Like all that work had never mattered in the first place.</span></p><p><span>“Then why did she leave?” she asked, voice coming out more feeble and pathetic than she’d ever heard it. She bit the inside of her cheek to distract herself from the harsh sting in her eyes. “It doesn’t make any sense.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia’s shoulders rose and fell imperceptibly. “I’m not going to answer for Rio,” she said carefully, “but if I had to guess? Maybe she assumed this was another way of protecting you. That it was the noble thing to remove herself from the equation before she messed anything up.”</span></p><p><span>“That still doesn’t explain why she tried to palm me off on my flaky ex,” Agatha grumbled, but her heart wasn’t in it anymore. Not when every ounce of blood in her body was working overtime to make sure it didn’t split down the middle. “She could’ve just told me she needed more time.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia just hummed, a pensive smile threatening her lips. “Sometimes it’s easier to pretend you don’t want something than admit exactly how much you do. Self preservation, perhaps.”</span></p><p><span>While it sounded like something straight out of a fortune cookie, it landed with sincerity, because Agatha knew the feeling all too well. She’d been there, a hundred times or more.</span></p><p><span>Amidst her parents’ neglect, she had learned to fend for herself in the world, survival instincts turning her hard and cold. She’d become reluctant to fully let anyone in, pre-empting the day it would all fall apart around her—just like it had when Rio walked away.</span></p><p><span>Rio, it seemed, lived in a similar kind of fear. Not side by side with Agatha’s, but certainly adjacent. Their upbringings had been different, but the product was almost equal—a messy, sticky relationship with abandonment, born from circumstances entirely out of their own control.</span></p><p><span>The last few weeks with Rio had relaxed Agatha’s defences, patience and kindness chipping away at her hard outer shell until, unknowingly, she’d exposed herself.</span></p><p><span>But if what Lilia was saying was right, that same collection of days had tightened Rio’s. She’d thrown her guard back up, not only to avoid getting hurt at someone else’s hand—but to stop herself from doing the hurting.</span></p><p><span>The reality of the situation came barrelling into her at full force, sending a shooting pain through her chest. Rio cared. Too much, maybe.</span></p><p><span>And while Agatha wouldn’t let her off easy after the way she’d chosen to show it, she owed her the opportunity to explain. To apologise, to unpack her reasons for running—to make things right, and to prove she’d stay.</span></p><p><span>She blinked slowly, already uncrossing her legs to stand. “Okay, I’m gonna—”</span></p><p><span>Lilia smiled kindly, leaning across the coffee table to give Agatha’s hand a quick pat. “Go,” she instructed. “Down the hall, second room on the right.”</span></p><p align="center"><span>———</span></p><p><span>Mere milliseconds later, Agatha stood outside a nondescript, cream-coloured door, psyching herself up to have the conversation that would change everything—again.</span></p><p><span>She wrung her hands, trying to expel some of her nervous energy, but it didn’t do much. The idea of finally talking to Rio, of getting all their shit out into the open, had propelled her through the morning. Now that she was actually here, though, that momentum had ground to a halt.</span></p><p><span>Doubt still flickered, small but unrelenting, in her mind—what if Rio had just asked her to talk so she could properly break up with her? The brief history she’d gotten from Lilia had shifted her perspective, but those words hadn’t been </span><em><span>Rio’s</span></em><span>. Everything was just hearsay until proven otherwise.</span></p><p><span>Still, she knew it was unavoidable. Amidst all the anger and confusion and gut-wrenching pain that swirled together, Agatha wanted Rio in her life. And any chance of getting what she wanted hinged on what came next.</span></p><p><span>Hesitantly she cracked the door, peeking inside for a glimpse of what she was walking into.</span></p><p><span>And there Rio was—lying on the bed face-up, staring at the ceiling like it might hold the answer to life’s most difficult questions. It wasn’t lost on Agatha, how she’d spent the last week in the exact same position, trying her fucking hardest to put all thoughts of Rio out of her mind.</span></p><p><span>She took a grounding breath and pushed the door the rest of the way open, wincing as it creaked on its hinges and startled Rio out of her stupor.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, shit,” Rio stammered, scrambling to sit against the headboard. Her voice sounded scratchy, like she’d only just woken up, but the red rims of her eyes told a different story.</span></p><p><span>“Hi,” she breathed. “I didn’t realise you’d be here so early.” She blinked a few times, then looked down at her smart watch. “It’s 9am.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged, trying to force down the soft flicker of emotion that rose at seeing Rio for the first time in a week. God, she looked exhausted. Dark circles rimmed her eyes, her hair was a mess, and there was a giant hole in the shoulder of her threadbare t-shirt, thrown on over a pair of boxers.</span></p><p><span>“I was up. Knew you would be too. Sorry, I uh, should’ve knocked.”</span></p><p><span>“Thank you for coming,” Rio said softly. She looked as if she wanted to stand up, palms already pressing into the mattress, but something got the better of her. “How are you?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gave Rio’s thanks a brief nod of acknowledgement, but didn’t respond to her question. While simple on the surface, </span><em><span>how are you </span></em><span>was deceptively loaded. Yes, she’d managed to confront her own emotions in Rio’s absence—but that didn’t mean she was ready to offload them just yet. </span></p><p><span>Especially when the real answer was </span><em><span>awful</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Never worse</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Lost without you</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Lilia told me you were sick,” she deflected, already looking around Rio’s bedroom for signs of the truth. Anything to avoid latching onto those forlorn brown eyes, if only for a moment.</span></p><p><span>Like the rest of the house, it was cozy, but it didn’t carry the same charm as Rio’s room back at home—back at her</span> <span>apartment, rather. She supposed she’d brought most of her stuff with her when she moved, which is why the space was mostly devoid of greenery, just a single plant with pearl-like leaves trailing off the corner of a shelf. The walls were the same muted cream as the door, and blackout curtains hung from the only window, obscuring the morning sunshine.</span></p><p><span>The uncharacteristic darkness was just one of a few signs that the last week had been almost as shitty for Rio as it had for Agatha. Clothes she’d never seen her wear before hung limply on the back of a desk chair, waiting to be tucked away behind the half-ajar closet door. There was a collection of cutlery and blue-and-white bowls stacked messily on the dresser, and next to it, a graveyard of empty water bottles and soda cans.</span></p><p><span>All signs pointed to sickness, but Agatha still wasn’t convinced. “Are you actually not feeling well?”</span></p><p><span>“Mm-hmm,” Rio sniffed, tracking Agatha’s line of sight to the wastepaper basket full of crumpled-up tissues in the corner. “Everything hurts,” she said, her voice small and uncannily childlike.</span></p><p><span>“And how long has everything hurt for?” Agatha asked with the clinical precision of a doctor surveying a patient on their morning rounds.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, you know,” Rio chuckled half-heartedly. “A week, give or take.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at her folded arms, trying to hide her pained expression. After a minute and another breath, her gaze flicked back up and finally, properly met Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>She hadn’t planned on showing her hand this early, but between Lilia’s explanation and how distraught Rio looked, she couldn’t help but fold a little. “Me too.”</span></p><p><span>“Really?” Rio asked, eyes widening. “I— I thought you’d never want to speak to me again.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t,” Agatha lied. She took a hesitant step away from the door, towards the bed, and let it swing gently shut behind her.</span></p><p><span>“So what changed?”</span></p><p><em><span>God</span></em><span>, she barely knew where to begin. Human emotion was fucked. That was the only way to put it.</span></p><p><span>She wanted to bite back, tell Rio </span><em><span>nothing</span></em><span> and make her grovel at her feet for forgiveness. But as her eyes bored into Rio’s, and Rio’s stared beseechingly into hers, it felt… different.</span></p><p><span>All the advice she’d been given, from the two people who knew her and Rio best, respectively, pressed hard against the edges of her mind. </span><em><span>Maybe she’s scared</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t get me wrong, I’m still fucking pissed at you for even suggesting I get back with Ralph,” she bit out. Regret crossed Rio’s face, like the reminder both pained and embarrassed her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighed, hoping her next admission wouldn’t undermine her upper hand. “But I also think you were right. We need to talk about things like adults.”</span></p><p><span>She strode over to the bed and perched on one corner, as far away from Rio as possible. Closing the distance right now would be counterintuitive, lest her hands started reaching for Rio at their own accord.</span></p><p><span>“So let’s talk. Starting with why you suggested what you did, when you know that Ralph’s an asshole of the highest order.”</span></p><p><span>Rio flinched, then swallowed. “I didn’t mean it, Agatha,” she started, her voice already pleading. “What I said about you getting back together with him was so messed up. I— I’d rather jump off a fucking bridge than see you with him,” she added bitterly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed. “Funny way of showing it.” </span></p><p><span>“I know, I know… but I needed to be certain that he wasn’t what you wanted,” Rio said. “And maybe in the moment it was the easier thing to do than, I don’t know,” she shook her head forcefully, a quiet punishment. “Asking for what I want, I guess?”</span></p><p><span>She paused, clearing her throat awkwardly. Agatha could feel her own throat constricting around all the words that were trapped there, but she couldn’t free yet, not until Rio had said her piece.</span></p><p><span>“You were right, when you guessed it wasn’t about him. He was just a shield,” Rio explained, drawing in a shaky breath. “I saw how he came in, all guns blazing, hell-bent on talking to you about </span><em><span>his child</span></em><span>. As in, not </span><em><span>my child</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“And I get that’s not what we’re doing here, and he’s your baby’s dad, but— hearing him say it so plainly made me spiral to the point where I completely threw myself off course.”</span></p><p><span>“So you, what? Fell on your sword?” Agatha questioned. Over the last week, she’d grasped at every straw to figure out where Rio was coming from, and it was the only answer that made sense, especially now she’d spoken to Lilia.</span></p><p><span>Sacrifice. Misguided sacrifice, driven by fear—but sacrifice nonetheless.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded glumly, sad brown eyes boring into Agatha’s. “Yeah, I guess I did.”</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t have to do that, Rio,” Agatha said sharply, irritation filtering in. She pressed a hand to her forehead, thumb weighing heavy against her temple. “It </span><em><span>hurt</span></em><span>,” she choked out, her eyes beginning to burn again. “That you thought I wasn’t capable of deciding for myself. That you thought I wouldn’t choose you.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” she admitted. “I didn’t mean to hurt you, Agatha, I promise. I didn’t even mean for it to come out that way, it just… did.”</span></p><p><span>Rio scrubbed a hand across her face, momentarily hiding her stricken expression—but when she lifted it away, it was still there.</span></p><p><span>She looked at Agatha with a beseeching gaze. “I’m so sorry,” she breathed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let go of a sigh of her own. Well, that was the first part done—the apology she’d been waiting for. </span><em><span>Sorries </span></em><span>didn’t come easily to Agatha, but the words slipped from Rio’s lips weightlessly, so honest it almost took her breath away. They settled neatly into a space in her chest that she hadn’t realised had been gaping since last week, filling it with hope.</span></p><p><span>Of course, she couldn’t own up to that. Not just yet.</span></p><p><span>Agatha plastered a stern look on her face. “If I had my way, Ralph would disappear from the fucking face of the earth. And while that’s unfortunately not going to happen, unless someone knows something I don’t,” she groused, “one thing I can guarantee you is that we’re not getting back together.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded as the words sunk in, picking absently at a loose thread on her comforter. “Okay,” she finally said, her voice a little stronger than before. “Good. That’s good.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed out a short breath, feeling ten percent of the tension that had built up in her body dissipate. But there was still more to talk through—they’d barely begun to address the root of the problem. The real reason they were here was planted far deeper in the earth.</span></p><p><span>“So if the Ralph thing was just a cover-up,” she said, raising an eyebrow, “what was this actually all about?”</span></p><p><span>Rio was quiet for a moment, looking down at her hands. “I— </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>,” she muttered, picking at a chip in her nail that seemed to personally offend her.</span></p><p><span>After a moment, she tilted her chin back up. She pressed her lips together nervously before asking, voice ragged, “did Lilia tell you about my mom?”</span></p><p><span>“A little,” Agatha replied.</span></p><p><span>“I knew she would. Can’t keep her trap shut, that one,” she said dryly, letting out a brittle laugh. “What exactly did she say?”</span></p><p><span>“Just that you grew up looking after her. That she was sick most of your childhood,” Agatha replied, sidestepping around the specifics. No, that was all on Rio to explain—just because Lilia had painted the perfect picture of her grief, didn’t mean it was an accurate one. She had to hear it straight from the source.</span></p><p><span>“Yep,” Rio nodded. “Cancer. From when I was really young. I– I don’t really remember a time when she wasn’t sick.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s awful,” Agatha acknowledged softly, feeling the mask slip a little. “No kid should have to go through that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gave her a noncommittal hum, like she couldn’t quite concede that it </span><em><span>was </span></em><span>awful. It itched at Agatha’s limbs, the way Rio could just dismiss her own pain like that. But as much as she wanted to reach out and reassure her, she felt rooted to her spot on the bed.</span></p><p><span>Maybe the slight jump in her thigh gave her away, because Rio cast a tentative glance at the space next to her. “Will you…” she mumbled, fingers already skimming the half-made bedsheets.</span></p><p><span>Agatha drew her lip into her mouth, teeth worrying indentations into flesh that had seen better days. Her limbs felt too heavy, her body unbalanced, as she gave in and lifted herself off the bed.</span></p><p><span>After stalling by opening the blackout curtains, she curled into the cushions next to Rio, still keeping a careful distance between them. Closer, but not all the way there.</span></p><p><span>Rio tilted her body towards Agatha’s, tucking her legs underneath her. From this position, Agatha could see it all—every micro-expression that flitted across Rio’s face, her tiny freckles, the kaleidoscope of colours in her eyes, illuminated by the sunlight now spilling into the room.</span></p><p><span>“My mom was Catholic,” she eventually said, voice hollow. “Like, really, really Catholic. Rosaries, church every Sunday, a fucking shrine to the Virgin Mary in our living room,” she barked a laugh. “Puerto Ricans love their religion.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha mustered a tiny, mirthless smile, nodding at Rio to go on.</span></p><p><span>“Every day, for the last few years of her life, she’d pray that when she died—because she </span><em><span>knew </span></em><span>she was going to die,” she noted sadly, “that I’d be adopted by a good Catholic family with a mom and a dad. Clearly, that never happened.”</span></p><p><span>“Obviously I know the whole mom and dad thing is bullshit,” Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m </span><em><span>gay</span></em><span>, for god’s sakes. But I guess it stuck with me a little more than I realised. The idea of a ‘whole’ family,” she made air quotes with her fingers, “being better than an imperfect one. Better than the one we had, me and her.”</span></p><p><span>Her breath snagged. “So when it all started catching up to me, when I realised that being with you would inevitably mean having to, like, confront the idea of family,” she sighed, her voice thready like a stuttering pulse, “I freaked out. I ran, and I shouldn’t have.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s face fell as she listened to Rio lay her insecurities bare. </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, this hurt. She hadn’t expected it to </span><em><span>hurt</span></em><span> so much—Rio’s betrayal was sharp like a knife, but the reasons behind it constituted a blunt blade driving into her over and over again.</span></p><p><span>Rio bit her lip, but not before Agatha saw it tremble. “I know I have good people around me. Lilia, Alice. But some days I’m still not sure what the word </span><em><span>family</span></em><span> means. Or how I fit into one.”</span></p><p><span>“And you think I do?” Agatha asked incredulously. “Rio, I was raised by two narcissistic, neglectful</span> <span>assholes. My idea of family is as warped as yours.”</span></p><p><span>She paused, quietly marvelling at how they’d gotten here. Two people with bucketloads of issues and no clue how to begin working through them.</span></p><p><span>Two people who’d found each other anyway, and without even realising, had kind of, almost, made the thing they didn’t think they were capable of.</span></p><p><span>Hesitantly, she placed an open palm on Rio’s knee. “All I know is that what we had felt pretty damn close.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes clamped shut at the word </span><em><span>had</span></em><span>, a crease forming between her brows. Agatha had to stop herself from reaching out and smoothing it away with her thumb.</span></p><p><span>Her voice was small and pained as she said, “I thought so too.”</span></p><p><span>When she opened her eyes again, they were glassy, the tiny flecks of green that lived amongst the brown more pronounced. “That’s what scared me the most. I didn’t know if I was allowed to want this,” she confessed. “To want</span><em><span> all of this</span></em><span>, without knowing it was something you wanted too.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s heart rose in her chest. “But you do, now that you’ve had time to think about it?” she asked cautiously, pulse racing. “Want this?”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>,” Rio urged softly, her voice breaking on impact. “But I just—” she paused, a tear slipping from one eye. “You deserve the world, Agatha. I don’t know how to give you that.”</span></p><p><span>While Rio said it plainly, like it was an undeniable fact, it struck Agatha hard. As her heart thrummed in her throat, she turned over the words—</span><em><span>you deserve the world</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>All this time, she’d wondered why Rio had wanted her in the first place. A middle-aged, often grumpy, soon-to-be first time mom who rarely felt like she had her shit together, especially when it came to the unnerving newness of dating a woman. Of dating someone she liked in general.</span></p><p><span>But here Rio was, doubting whether she was capable of offering Agatha everything </span><em><span>she</span></em><span> deserved. As if </span><em><span>Rio </span></em><span>was the lucky one.</span></p><p><span>Jesus Christ, they both needed so much therapy.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed her lips together, willing herself not to cry, and let out a long, loud exhale. “Well, then you’re a fucking idiot.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked at her in shock, freeing more tears. Before she could speak, Agatha was leaning in to brush them away, shaking her head as she did. Brown eyes tracked the movement, confused.</span></p><p><span>“You already have,” Agatha eventually said, half-grumble, half-indisputable statement.</span></p><p><span>“I already have, what?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Do I really have to say it?” she groaned quietly. As good at feelings</span> <span>as she’d become over the last few months, this one was a little harder to admit. But she wanted to, and she </span><em><span>had</span></em><span> to, though it was easily the corniest thing that’d ever left her lips.</span></p><p><span>“Given me the world,” she acquiesced, her face softening. “And if you can’t see that, well, you’re an idiot.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s bottom lip quivered, moulding into a self-conscious pout. “Really? How?” she asked, ignoring Agatha’s insults.</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god,” Agatha muttered, already scooting closer. She wrapped an arm around one of Rio’s shoulders, pulling her head onto her chest, and began to weave her fingers through her hair.</span></p><p><span>She’d missed this—the familiarity of Rio in her arms. She sat with it for a moment, revelling in the feeling of being close to her again, before beginning to list off her reasons.</span></p><p><span>“Well, you came to my amnio without even having to be asked. You keep me fed—I don’t know what my diet would’ve consisted of these last few months without you. You made sure I didn’t die of dehydration after projectile barfing like something out of a horror movie,” she added, absently combing a knot out of Rio’s dark strands. “Must I go on?”</span></p><p><span>Rio sniffled, tilting her head up to look at Agatha. A wet patch had gathered on the linen fabric of Agatha’s shirt, and the culprit was obvious—Rio’s tears had turned into a torrent now, dripping down her face. “Yes, please,” she whispered hoarsely.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, you care for me like it’s the most natural thing in the world,” Agatha said, expelling a slow breath. “No one has ever— no one’s ever done that for me. Not without wanting something in return.”</span></p><p><span>She looked down at her belly, Rio’s head nestled just above where her bump began, so close she could kiss it. With the hand that wasn’t threading through Rio’s hair, Agatha cupped it tenderly. “And by doing all those things, you’re caring for this baby, too. Helping me keep him safe. Don’t you get that?”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Rio hummed sadly. “I could’ve done more. Starting with staying when shit got hard.”</span></p><p><span>“Trust me, I’d erase the last week if I could. It got a little bleak,” Agatha barked a humourless laugh. “Although I’m still mad about how you left… it makes a little more sense now.”</span></p><p><span>“We’re never going to be perfect, Rio. No family is,” she added, thinking suddenly of Wanda and Vision. By Rio’s standards, they’d done everything right—stayed together, bought the house with the white picket fence, parented the twins to near adulthood. It hadn’t played out the way they’d intended it to.</span></p><p><span>And yet, that didn’t change anything—they were still a unit, and a damn solid one at that. She’d called Billy to see how he was doing on her drive over that morning, and his response had been oddly </span><em><span>fine</span></em><span>. Sure, there’d been a little drama about it overshadowing his senior year, but apart from that, the kid had been more interested in talking her ear off about Eddie than agonizing over his parents’ impending divorce. The teens of today were truly something.</span></p><p><span>“I’m going to fuck up, and you’re going to fuck up,” Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Just at a much lesser magnitude, I hope. And I guess the kid’ll fuck up eventually, too,” she chuckled. Rio let out a breathy laugh of her own.</span></p><p><span>“But I’ve spent the last few months trying to circumvent the mess,” she pondered, hand stilling against Rio’s temple. “To control it, like that was ever going to work. So maybe we just have to embrace it, instead.”</span></p><p><span>“What if I’m not good at it, though?” Rio questioned, her voice still tinged with concern. The tears had slowed, but even with Rio’s head tucked into her chest, she could see them collecting along her waterline like soldiers lining up to fight. “Being, like… a responsible person in a child’s life?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t hesitate this time. “You will be,” she said softly. “This kid is already so lucky to have you in his life, Rio. And I—,” she paused, pulling in a breath.</span></p><p><span>The words had been living in her brain for so long that they owed her a rent check, but now, it was time to slap a bright red eviction notice on them.</span></p><p><span>“If we’re going to do this, I want you in it. More than just adjacent. In it, like, really </span><em><span>in it</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Rio scrambled out of her embrace and back up to a sitting position, so quickly that it made Agatha’s brow furrow in amusement. “You mean that?” she asked breathily.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you dummy,” Agatha chided, though it was more of a gentle encouragement. “I realised while we were apart that I’d never said it in so many words… but I do. I think I have for a while now.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god,” Rio buried her head in her hands. She choked out a wet laugh, looking back up at Agatha a moment later. “You don’t know how great it feels to hear you say that.”</span></p><p><span>“I… </span><em><span>maybe </span></em><span>could’ve been more honest with you, too, about what I wanted. So, I guess we’re both kinda idiots,” Agatha said apologetically. She pointed a finger at Rio. “You more than me, though.”</span></p><p><span>The corner of Rio’s mouth ticked up briefly, then faded into something more serious.</span></p><p><span>“So what does this actually mean?” she asked carefully, worry beginning to cloud her eyes. “I want this, and you want this, but… the last week still happened.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, memories of crying alone in their apartment resurfacing. “Yeah, it did,” she said gravely. “You’re right.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m an asshole for leaving,” Rio managed, already sounding choked up again. “For not calling ‘til the other day. I don’t know if words can convey exactly how sorry I am.” Her fingers drummed against the mattress, like she wanted to grab Agatha’s hand but wasn’t sure if she was allowed to yet. “But I’m here now.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, letting her sight drop from Rio back down to her belly. Her eyes flitted from the fabric of her shirt, to the cool green of the bedsheets, to the voidlike darkness of her phone screen, resting on the edge of the bed.</span></p><p><span>As she filled her lungs with air, she felt Rio’s posture tighten beside her, but she didn’t dare look back up and take in her expression yet.</span></p><p><span>“Rio, I want to be with you,” she started, then fell victim to the tail end of her sigh. “But I don’t know what I’d do if you left again. I mean, I’d chase you down with a fucking axe first,” she muttered. “But after that.”</span></p><p><span>“This shit is going to get realer and realer by the day. Pregnancy is just the tip of the iceberg.” She caught her lower lip between her teeth and finally looked back up at Rio. “How do I know you’re not going to run when things get hard again?”</span></p><p><span>Rio made a small, sad noise. “I suppose that me saying I’d never put you through that again doesn’t mean a lot right now,” she acknowledged. “But I’ll do whatever it takes, Agatha. I’ll show up however you want me to.” She sucked in a steadying breath, rolling her shoulders back. “Anything you need, and not just until I’ve made it right.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded slowly, taking it in. She wanted to believe Rio, so badly she could feel it pulling at her physically. Her lungs ached from sighing. Her stomach churned uneasily. Her eyes hadn’t stopped stinging for the last godforsaken hour.</span></p><p><span>Despite all the signs begging her to just forgive, though, there was one thing holding her back.</span></p><p><em><span>Trust</span></em><span>. Another concept they both seemed to have a complicated relationship with. Their final hurdle, even after coming all this way.</span></p><p><span>“You better mean every word you’re saying right now, Rio. Because hurting me is one thing,” she warned, hand rubbing tight circles across her belly. “But this kid is another. There’s no turning back six months or a year or five years down the track. Once you’re in his life, I expect you to stay in it. Even if things between us don’t work out.”</span></p><p><span>“I understand. I’m all in,” Rio whispered the words like a vow. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew her trust wouldn’t just miraculously reappear after one conversation, or two, or maybe even ten—but maybe Rio’s words could serve as a foundation they’d build on together, as time passed. And Rio wouldn’t be able to earn it back without a little blind faith from Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she said carefully, feeling one of the many knots in her stomach loosen. “Good.” A tear pricked at the corner of her eye, but Rio had already stretched a thumb out to catch it by the time it fell.</span></p><p><span>“So what happens next?” Rio asked slowly. “Do you want me to stay here at Lilia’s a little while longer? I, uh, wouldn’t blame you if you needed some space.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard, pushing down a lump that had unceremoniously risen in her throat. Rationally, that sounded like a good idea—god only knew that living together had compounded their relationship and forced it to this uncomfortable breaking point.</span></p><p><span>But she’d already done enough missing, and wanting, and waiting. It was almost certainly crazy, but now that Rio had pledged to stick around, the only thing she could think of was waking up next to her every day. To a gap-toothed smile, and patient brown eyes, and strong arms clasped protectively around her waist.</span></p><p><span>“Is that what </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> want?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio replied without hesitation, shaking her head emphatically.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath left her chest in a flood. “Now feels like a pretty good time for honesty, then,” she chastised Rio. “Ask for what you want.”</span></p><p><span>Whether Agatha would fold and give her everything she asked for, well, that was another thing. Or at least, that’s what she’d tell herself. But she needed to hear it—she needed Rio to put her heart on the line. Completely.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve already proven I’m not great at that,” Rio huffed, but her expression turned tender again in an instant. She tugged at Agatha’s palm and covered it with her own, warm and grounding, while the other one came around to tentatively cup her cheek.</span></p><p><span>“I want…” Rio exhaled slowly, breath fanning across Agatha’s face, “to come home. And for it to be </span><em><span>our</span></em><span> home, not just the one we live in together because that’s the way the cookie crumbled.”</span></p><p><span>“I want you to be my girlfriend. I should’ve asked you that earlier,” she added, letting her thumb linger against Agatha’s cheekbone. She felt herself blush into Rio’s touch, the temperature of her skin hiking by at least a few degrees. </span><em><span>God</span></em><span>, this woman—she had the power to turn Agatha into a blazing inferno, in more ways than one.</span></p><p><span>“I guess I just thought you knew that’s what I wanted,” Rio admitted shyly. “but I’ll gladly say it. And ask you a million times until you say yes, if I have to.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept her mouth firmly closed, knowing that a </span><em><span>yes </span></em><span>might slip out without permission if she dared to open it.</span></p><p><span>“And I want to keep figuring this out, together. For as long as you’ll have me,” Rio finished. She tucked a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear, so naturally it was almost like nothing had changed between them. </span></p><p><span>It had. But Agatha was starting to think that it was for the better.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Agatha agreed softly. She looked into Rio’s eyes, finding them warm and waiting, and wondered how much longer she’d have to go without kissing her. “But I have a few more conditions.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes crinkled, a tiny laugh escaping her lips. “Anything,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled back, removing Rio’s hand from her cheek. She took it in her own and rested all four of them, intertwined, in the space between them. “Number one, you have to talk to me. </span><em><span>Honestly</span></em><span>, Rio,” she stressed. “No more disappearing for a week without an explanation ever again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio winced. “I suppose it wouldn’t help my case if I showed you all the half-written apologies saved in my Notes app?”</span></p><p><span>She blew a raspberry in reply. “Well, considering you never sent me any of them, no.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry, Agatha,” Rio apologised again. “I just— I spent the whole week choking on my words. None of them felt right. I didn’t know what I could possibly say to explain what I was feeling, or to make things better,” she said tiredly, untangling one hand to run it through her hair.</span></p><p><span>“That’s why I didn’t call or text until the other day. And I really have been sick,” she added. “Though I wouldn’t be surprised if I brought that on myself. Karma.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled, before straightening. “Look, I know I’m not always amazing at this stuff, either… though we have really been giving the therapists of the world a run for their money today,” she mused, realising </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> they’d done for the last hour or so was talk. </span><em><span>Fuck</span></em><span>, maybe she was getting kinda good at this.</span></p><p><span>“Anyway, we both have to try. I’ll probably get pissed off at you about something and not want to discuss it, and you’ll get in your head and do the same thing,” she rattled off. “But all this emotional maturity shit points to talking being the answer. As much as the idea pains me.”</span></p><p><span>“I can do that,” Rio replied easily, squeezing Agatha’s hand. “What’s the other condition?”</span></p><p><span>“You have to let me take care of you, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flickered with recognition, like she’d guessed that this was coming. Maybe she had—because if Agatha had to draw a pie chart of all the reasons they’d ended up here, Rio’s reluctance to share, to let herself be vulnerable, would occupy the biggest piece.</span></p><p><span>“I know it’s in your nature to be the protector,” Agatha explained gently. “And you do a damn good job at it, even in light of this little… slip-up. But if you bottle up all your feelings because you think mine trump them,” she sighed. “Then this is never going to work.”</span></p><p><span>Rio inhaled a shaky breath, her gaze dropping to their hands. Slowly, she nodded. “I think that can be arranged,” she said, and then she lifted her gaze to meet Agatha’s, and </span><em><span>oh</span></em><span>, there was the sun again. Even through the fresh tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” Agatha murmured, feeling the rays of Rio’s smile ease something in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“So, does that mean I can come home?” Rio asked tentatively.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you can come home,” she relented, as if she’d ever considered entertaining another answer.</span></p><p><span>Rio reached out to hook a hand around Agatha’s waist like an anchor. “And what about the other thing?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted, a smirk building on her lips. She tipped her head back against the pillows as she groaned, “you’re relentless, Vidal. Seriously, why are you so obsessed with me?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s okay,” Rio shrugged indifferently, scooting in closer. “You don’t have to answer right away. I’ll work my way up to girlfriend status.”</span></p><p><span>“Very presumptuous,” Agatha muttered.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, so you’ll happily let me commit to years of dirty diapers, but being my girlfriend is too much for you. Got it,” Rio said, tapping the side of her nose.</span></p><p><span>Well, she had her there. Slapping a label on it had never mattered much to Agatha before, but she’d been quietly yearning for </span><em><span>more</span></em><span> with Rio for an infuriatingly long time. And now, here Rio was, promising it to her.</span></p><p><span>“Fine, fine,” Agatha grumbled. “I’m your girlfriend, or whatever. I’m fucking 42,” she emphasised, rolling her eyes.</span></p><p><span>The grin that materialised on Rio’s face was nothing short of dopey. “Wow, you caved quick,” she mused. “Thought you’d make me hold out a little longer than that, if I’m being honest.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha just grunted, not wanting to give her any more satisfaction. Her girlfriend was a little shit, that was for sure.</span></p><p><span>“So now that we’ve made things official,” Rio bit her lip, “can I please kiss you?”</span></p><p><span>“Mmm,” Agatha considered, already wrapping her arms around Rio’s neck. She tilted her chin so her face was hovering close to Rio’s, just a breath apart, and looked into amber eyes. “If you must.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, I must,” Rio murmured, bridging the last sliver of distance between them. Agatha closed her eyes and let full, familiar lips find hers, melting them together into a slow, unhurried kiss.</span></p><p><span>Fucking </span><em><span>finally</span></em><span>.</span></p><p align="center"><span>———</span></p><p><span>The two of them stayed intertwined for an indeterminable amount of time; tired from all the talking, just happy to exist. The sounds of the world going by indicated the minutes were passing—but inside Rio’s teenage bedroom, it made no difference.</span></p><p><span>There was only them, and the new reality they’d forged in fire, and the real, steady promise of a future. One where all their cards were face-up on the table, and no words were left unspoken.</span></p><p><span>From their new position, Agatha’s head resting against Rio’s chest, she looked up at her. “What are you thinking about?” she probed, taking in Rio’s soft smile and pensive stare.</span></p><p><span>“Something you said, before,” Rio replied quietly, brushing a hand over Agatha’s hair. Her voice trembled slightly, emotion filtering into her tone. “Is the baby a boy?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a soft laugh. She hadn’t even realised she’d said it, but trust Rio to pick up a single pronoun slip and run with it. “Mm-hmm,” she confirmed, patting her bump. “I found out the other day, at my anatomy scan.”</span></p><p><span>“Congratulations, Agatha,” Rio whispered reverently, like she couldn’t believe it. “A boy.”</span></p><p><span>“A boy,” Agatha echoed.</span></p><p><span>A glimmer of mirth crossed Rio’s face, pulling at the corner of her lips. “Oh my god, there’s a tiny penis inside you </span><em><span>right now</span></em><span>,” she chuckled, eyes flashing playfully.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, perhaps the first real laugh she’d emitted in a week. She felt it settle around them both, sending the mood skywards. “Wouldn’t be the first time. Hopefully it’s the last.”</span></p><p><span>“You and me both,” Rio joked dryly.</span></p><p><span>And just like magic, Agatha felt it again—the persistent beat of a little foot or hand strumming against her belly from the inside. She’d never get sick of this kid’s uncanny ability to join in the conversation exactly when she needed it.</span></p><p><span>“Wait, I think he heard us talking about him,” she said, awe transforming her smile into a full-blown grin. She offered her palm to Rio. “Hand.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s with ease and let it be guided to the swell of her belly.</span></p><p><span>“Feel it this time?” Agatha asked. She didn’t need to, though—the way Rio’s eyes glowed was confirmation enough.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” she breathed, pressing her palm down a little firmer. Her thumb started to travel back and forth absently against the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, driven by instinct alone. “Fuck, that’s so wild.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked down at her stomach and the hand covering Rio’s. The movements continued, as rhythmic and strong as a kick-drum. “Pretty crazy, huh?”</span></p><p><span>Rio was quiet for a moment, but Agatha could hear the soft hitch of her breath. When she found Rio’s gaze again, a tear was already travelling down her cheek, glistening against her smooth, golden skin.</span></p><p><span>“He’s so </span><em><span>real</span></em><span>,” she said, voice watery but brimming with wonder. “How big is he today?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha sat up slowly, reaching across to grab her phone where it had been deposited carelessly on the edge of the bed hours earlier. She flicked it open to her pregnancy app, then nestled back into her place in Rio’s arms. Rio’s hand found her stomach again, resuming its tender strokes.</span></p><p><span>The pop-up glowed orange. “The size of a bunch of carrots,” she said dubiously, scrunching up her face. “That’s not as cute as the avocado.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed quietly, craning her neck to see the screen. “A papaya next week,” she mused. “That’s a little better.”</span></p><p><em><span>Next week</span></em><span>. As in, Rio would be here to see it—to walk alongside her as her son grew and grew, until he eventually made it to earth. After that, too. Forever, maybe.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t say anything to that effect to Rio, instead just happy to bask in the careful but solid resolution they’d found, but she felt it all the same.</span></p><p><span>She knew things might get hard again, and her trust in Rio wouldn’t just return to its old state overnight. They’d make more messes—Agatha didn’t doubt her ability to stumble, or to break her own rules. Maybe there’d be blips where Rio retreated into her head again, or where the perils of raising a child would threaten to upend them.</span></p><p><span>But they’d field them together. They had to. Because now, Agatha couldn’t imagine it any other way.</span></p>
