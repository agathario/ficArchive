<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Most days, Agatha Harkness moved through the world with an unshakable certainty in her own invincibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was untouchable and revered. Her life was meticulously constructed on a foundation of unyielding rules and hard won respect. No one dared to challenge her or chip away at the fortress she had built around herself through relentless hard work. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But today, the universe seemed determined to remind her that even the strongest walls could quake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the glossy hospital sign,</span>
<b> Mayo Clinic</b>
<span>, as sunlight glinted off its pristine lettering from the seat of her car. This was it. Her first day as Chief Neonatal Surgeon in a new city, far from the life she’d painstakingly constructed and subsequently watched crumble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the comfort of her car she couldn’t help but wonder how she had ended up here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s move had been less a choice and more a necessity, a bid for survival after the implosion of her carefully curated life. Her divorce had been a spectacular disaster, the kind that made even her closest friends recoil from the sheer wreckage of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It started unraveling, slow and subtle. Her husband, Daniel, had always been charming; a literature professor with a disarming smile and a knack for storytelling that had captivated her years ago. But over time, his charm gave way to resentment. She worked long hours as one of the top neonatal surgeons in NYU and her ambition seemed to needle him in ways neither of them could articulate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What began as arguments about late nights and missed dinners escalated into something darker. Daniel grew bitter, accusing her of valuing her career over their marriage, over him, over their kid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The final blow came when she discovered the affair. It wasn’t the affair itself, she had long suspected something, but the brazenness of it. He had brought the woman, a graduate student barely older than their marriage into their home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The divorce proceedings were venomous, with Daniel demanding a ludicrous settlement. claiming that her relentless dedication to her career had left him a lonely man raising their son Nicholas practically on his own. The custody battle was the worst of it. Agatha had always known she wasn’t the stereotypical mother, she couldn’t make school drop offs or bake cookies for fundraisers, but she loved her son fiercely. By the time the dust settled, Agatha had lost more than her marriage. She lost the brownstone they’d renovated together, the antique furniture she’d handpicked, and the city she had called home for over two decades. Staying in New York felt untenable; the reminders of her old life were everywhere, suffocating her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, she was granted joint custody, but the arrangement was fragile. Daniel made snide comments about her being too busy or distracted whenever he handed Nicholas over. Agatha felt like a guest in her own son’s life, her time with Nicky carved out of an already overburdened schedule.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The divorce had been finalized six months ago when the offer from Mayo Clinic came, it felt like a lifeline. Minnesota, with its sprawling landscapes and unfamiliar pace, was as far removed from Manhattan as she could imagine. It was a place to rebuild, to start over, not as the betrayed wife or the workaholic surgeon but as someone new. A new life for her and Nicky, a new beginning for them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The hospital loomed tall and sterile before her, a stark contrast to the historic urban hospital she had left behind. It reeked of new beginnings, with a tinge of antiseptic and unfamiliarity. Agatha adjusted her white coat, already tailored to perfection, and squared her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the halls buzzed with the typical morning rush. Residents darted between patients, and nurses exchanged hurried updates. Her shoes clicked against the tile as she strode toward the neonatal unit, eyes forward, posture impeccable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Dr. Harkness?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice startled her only slightly, and she turned to see a young woman in scrubs standing at attention. Her badge read Jennifer Kale R.N.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes?" Agatha’s voice was even, her professional mask firmly in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m the charge nurse for the NICU," Jennifer said, her tone bright but edged with nerves. "Dr. Calderu asked me to show you around before rounds”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And why isn’t she here to welcome me?” She said</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer stiffened at Agatha's sharp tone, the smile on her face faltering. "Dr. Calderu had an emergency to attend to," she explained, her voice faltering slightly under Agatha's scrutiny. "She asked me to show you around before rounds. She’ll see you after the rounds."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips thinned as she stared at Jennifer, the weight of her gaze making the nurse shift uncomfortably. "I was led to believe the chief of surgery would be here to greet me, not a charge nurse." Her words were clipped, a hint of disdain slipping through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I— I understand,” Jennifer stammered, trying to regain composure. “Dr. Calderu is very busy, but I’m happy to show you around in the meantime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, clearly dissatisfied with the situation. "Fine. But I expect this to be rectified immediately," she said, her voice cold, and turned her attention to the bustling NICU, her impatience palpable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer nodded quickly, trying to remain calm. "Of course, Dr. Harkness. Please, follow me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension lingered as Agatha followed, her expression still tight with annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Very well," Agatha replied. She followed her through the labyrinth of hallways, mentally cataloging every turn and department. The NICU was spacious, lined with incubators and soft beeping monitors. It smelled of clean linens and faintly of hope, a smell Agatha had always associated with her work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Jennifer rattled off statistics about the unit’s capacity and recent successes, Agatha’s gaze fell on a young couple huddled near an incubator, their hands pressed to the glass. Their infant, impossibly small, stretched its delicate fingers as if testing the air. Agatha’s chest tightened, not with sentimentality, but with purpose. This was why she was here. This was what she excelled at.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The charge nurse’s voice broke through her thoughts. "I hope you’ll like it here, Dr. Harkness. We’re all excited to work with you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t need them to like me," Agatha thought, her lips curving into a faint, polite smile. "I need them to keep up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thank you, Nurse Kale," she said aloud, her tone clipped but not unkind. "I’ll be ready for rounds in fifteen minutes"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer nodded and scurried off, leaving Agatha alone in the middle of her new kingdom. She adjusted her coat again, letting her fingers briefly brush the amulet hidden beneath it, a habit she hadn’t yet broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t the life she had envisioned years ago, but it was the life she had now. And for all its unknowns, there was one thing she could rely on: the work. The work had never betrayed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in the quiet of the hallway, her reflection flickering faintly on the polished glass of an observation window. The NICU buzzed softly behind her, the rhythmic hum of machines a steady backdrop to her thoughts. This wasn’t just a new chapter, it was an entirely new book, and she was determined to write it with precision, with control, with success as she always did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed in her pocket, jolting her from her reverie. She pulled it out to see a photo of Nicholas, his gap-toothed grin filling the screen. He was holding up a crayon drawing of what looked like a dragon, its body a swirl of colors, with stick figures on either side. One labeled Me wore a green cape, and the other labeled Mom had impossibly tall hair and a tiny stethoscope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at her lips. Nicholas was four, with a boundless imagination and an uncanny ability to make her feel both invincible and utterly vulnerable. The divorce had hit him in ways she hadn’t fully anticipated. He’d gone from being a bubbly, chatty toddler to a child who sometimes stared out windows longer than she thought any four-year-old should.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The move to Minnesota was supposed to be a balm for both of them, a way to step out of the shadows of what they’d lost. But Agatha worried about him constantly. Would he settle into the new preschool? Make friends? Did he feel like she’d uprooted his life just as much as Daniel had fractured hers?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The message attached to the photo was from his nanny, Claire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"First masterpiece in Minnesota! He said it’s you and him fighting a snow dragon. Drop-off went great this morning. He misses you already."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment before typing back:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tell him I miss him too. And that the snow dragon doesn’t stand a chance."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped the phone back into her pocket, her professional mask sliding effortlessly into place as she turned toward the door to the staff lounge. She couldn’t dwell. Nicholas needed her to succeed here, to prove this move wasn’t a mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fifteen minutes later, she was in the NICU, leading her first rounds. Nurses and residents flanked her, their expressions a mixture of awe and apprehension. Agatha’s reputation preceded her, and she could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on her like a heavy mantle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze swept over the team, noting the subtle shifts in posture, the way some of the younger residents avoided eye contact, while others tried to mimic her calm, commanding presence. She thrived on this, on the sharpness of their gazes, the undercurrent of fear mixed with respect. It wasn’t just respect. It was awe. They feared her, and Agatha had always known how to make that fear work in her favor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reveled in the power it gave her, that ability to command a room, to make people see her as an unyielding force. It had taken years to build that reputation, but now, it was hers to wield. And as she moved from incubator to incubator, her eyes calculating, her voice crisp with authority, she felt a surge of satisfaction. They were watching. They were listening. And she would make sure they knew that she was the one in charge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, glancing down at a small preemie in one of the incubators, her expression softening for just a moment. But it was only for a moment. She had a role to play, and that role was one of unwavering control. She straightened, turning to the resident closest to her. “Tell me about the baby’s progress,” she demanded, her voice cool and unwavering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The young doctor stammered, fumbling through notes, but Agatha didn’t give him a second to recover. “Speak clearly. I expect more than a summary. I want details—actual data,” she snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident quickly straightened, eyes wide. “Y-yes, Dr. Harkness. The baby’s heart rate is stable, but there’s concern about the oxygen levels—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha cut him off, her voice already moving on to the next patient. “But it’s not enough. You’ll adjust the ventilator settings and start an arterial blood gas. Get it right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved swiftly through the rounds, her team scrambling to keep up, each word from her a razor-sharp instruction. They might fear her, but Agatha knew she was molding them into the team she needed. Every second, every decision was an opportunity to prove her expertise. And no one would question her authority, not now, not ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved from incubator to incubator, assessing charts, asking sharp, pointed questions. Occasionally, she glanced at the infants, tiny, fragile beings whose survival depended on her expertise and the team she now commanded. She felt the familiar surge of focus, the calm that came with knowing she was in her element.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the rounds drew to a close, she could feel the shift in the room. The team had settled into a rhythm, their earlier nerves giving way to a kind of practiced obedience. Agatha’s presence was undeniable, her leadership absolute. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to the last resident of the day, her gaze piercing. “I expect a full report on each of these cases by the end of the day,” she said, her voice as cold as ever. “And don't think I won’t know if you’ve missed something.” She paused, making sure they understood the weight of her words. “Now go. And do it right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she turned on her heel, her back straight, her eyes scanning the rest of the NICU as she moved toward the exit. She was untouchable. They would learn quickly, Agatha Harkness didn’t make mistakes. And neither should they.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, as she sat in her new office, surrounded by stacks of unopened files and the faint glow of her computer screen, she looked at the photo of Nicholas again. The drawing of the snow dragon felt oddly prophetic. Life here would be a battle, a fight against uncertainty, against the lingering specter of her divorce, against her own self doubt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t back down from battles. Not in the operating room. Not in life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And certainly not for her son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened her desk, ensuring the papers and files were in precise order. Her first day had already been a whirlwind, and now she had her introductory meeting with the hospital's Surgical Chief, Dr. Lilia Calderu. She’d heard the name in passing during her career, an accomplished transplant surgeon, known for her bold techniques and her equal flair for hospital politics.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sharp knock on her office door came just as she adjusted a framed photo of Nicholas on the corner of her desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Come in," she called, her tone brisk but polite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened to reveal a short, broad shouldered woman with dark hair with silver at the temples. Her piercing hazel eyes took in the room as he stepped inside. She carried himself with the casual confidence of someone used to command, but there was a warmth in her expression that caught her off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Dr. Harkness," she said, extending a hand. "Lilia Calderu. Welcome to Mayo. I’m sorry I miss your arrival this morning, emergency surgery. You know how it is”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood and shook her hand, her grip firm. "Thank you, Dr. Calderu. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lilia," she corrected, her smile easy. "Titles can get exhausting around here, don’t you think?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to raise an eyebrow. She had spent years in the highly hierarchical world of New York medicine, where first names were reserved for close colleagues or the rare moments of camaraderie. But Minnesota seemed intent on presenting a different way of doing things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Lilia, then," she said, allowing herself a small, polite and controlled smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please, sit with me" she said, gesturing toward the sofa that was on the corner of the office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha left her desk and took the seat carefully, her posture still impeccable despite the casual invitation. She crossed her legs, placing her hands neatly on her lap, and scanned the office with a practiced eye. It was sleek, well organized, but had a certain warmth to it that felt somewhat foreign to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia Calderu took her seat across from her, folding her hands in front of her. “ Your reputation precedes you, and let me tell you, it’s not easy to impress the folks up in recruitment. I hope your first rounds went well,” she said with a smile, her tone warm but laced with curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t allow herself to soften at the tone. Instead, she met her gaze with a level stare, her voice crisp. “They went as expected. There’s always a bit of... adjustment when stepping into a new environment. The residents are all over the place and I hope I can mold them to be better”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s smile faltered for just a moment, but she quickly regained her composure and nodded thoughtfully. She studied Agatha, sensing the sharpness in her words, the drive that was both formidable and, perhaps, a little daunting. “I’m sure you will,” she said smoothly, her tone still warm but carrying a slight edge of caution. “The residents here are bright, but I understand the desire to shape them. Just remember, this environment thrives on collaboration, not command.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Agatha’s response was clipped, the slight tension still lingering in the room. She wasn’t here for small talk, and she certainly wasn’t here to discuss her personal adjustment. But Lilia seemed content to maintain the friendly tone, her smile never wavering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, how’s the team? They seem eager to have you on board,” Lilia remarked, leaning back in her chair slightly. “But I’m sure you’ve already noticed the culture shift here. Mayo has a reputation for being... collaborative.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze flickered for a brief moment, then she straightened herself, meeting Lilia’s eyes again. “Collaborative?” she repeated, her tone carefully neutral. She had heard whispers about Mayo’s culture, about the idea of working together, sharing decisions, offering input. It was a world apart from the highly competitive, cutthroat environment she was used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s smile softened slightly, as if she were aware of the challenge that this might present to Agatha. “Yes, collaborative. We believe in bringing together a diverse set of voices, pooling our expertise to ensure the best care for our patients. I’m sure it’s an adjustment, but I have no doubt you’ll thrive in this environment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers twitched, betraying a flicker of discomfort. She had always trusted her own instincts, her own decisions. The idea of relying on a collective group, of yielding to others in any way, made her uneasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m used to running a team," she said, her voice steady but firm. “But I’m adaptable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s smile widened just a little, sensing the undercurrent of tension. “Good. Because here, we value every opinion, whether it’s from a nurse, a resident, or a senior attending. No one is ever truly alone in their decisions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but she masked it quickly, nodding in acknowledgment. “Understood. I’ll do my part to integrate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sat up a little straighter, the conversation shifting as she took a breath. “I wanted to make sure we’re clear on expectations. I know you're here to make an immediate impact, and I want you to feel empowered to lead in your own way. But you should know that at Mayo, it's less about commanding and more about leading.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip twitched as she processed the words. Leading, not commanding. She wasn’t sure how to feel about that. She had led with precision and authority for so long, the idea of adapting to a more... nuanced style didn’t sit entirely well with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I appreciate the clarification, Lilia,” she said slowly. “And I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s eyes glinted with something like understanding, though her smile remained warm. “I’m confident you will. But I also want to remind you that we’re all here for the same goal. The patients. We take pride in our ability to work as a team, no matter how different our approaches might be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her gaze for a moment, considering her words. "I'll make sure to remember that," she said, her voice smooth and controlled. But in her mind, a quiet storm was already brewing. She was used to working alone, relying only on herself. The idea of balancing her control with the collective input of others was a challenge, but Agatha didn’t shy away from challenges. She’d find a way to make it work, on her terms. The she continue choosing her words carefully. "I appreciate the opportunity to lead the NICU team here. The work they’re doing is impressive, and I’m looking forward to helping elevate it even further."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia leaned back in his chair, studying her for a moment. "I like that. I’ve looked over your record, your success rates, your innovations in neonatal surgical procedures. It’s impressive, no question. But I also know you’re stepping into a team that’s been running a certain way for years. Change, even when it’s necessary, can be… complicated."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m not here to make unnecessary changes," Agatha said evenly. "But I do believe there’s always room for improvement, and I’ve never been afraid to make adjustments when they’re in the best interest of the patients."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good," Lilia said with a nod. "And fair warning: there are a few strong personalities on your team. Don’t be surprised if you meet some resistance. But from what I hear, you’re not one to back down from a challenge."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allowed herself a genuine smile this time. "Challenges tend to bring out the best in me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia chuckled, the sound deep and resonant. "I thought as much. And since we’re being candid, I’ll tell you this: I’m glad you’re here. We’ve needed someone with your drive and expertise in the NICU for a while. But if you ever feel like this place is… different from what you’re used to, don’t hesitate to let me know. Mayo has its quirks, but it grows on you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thank you," she said, her tone softening slightly. "I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know," she said, her tone lighter now, "it might be good for you to meet the rest of the surgical department sooner rather than later. We have a bit of a tradition around here, dinner with the surgeons and their teams every few months. A way to keep things collaborative and… human."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly. "A dinner?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smiled, a knowing glint in her eyes. "Yes, and before you ask, no, it’s not mandatory, and yes, it can sometimes feel like herding cats. But it’s valuable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a soft chuckle despite herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's expression remained unreadable, her mind running through the potential benefits, or drawbacks, of such a gathering. She wasn’t fond of unnecessary socializing, especially when it took time away from work or her kid. But she also knew how these things worked. It was a small price to pay to maintain her position and further ingratiate herself into the Mayo culture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A dinner," Agatha repeated, her tone flat but inquisitive, as though trying to gauge what Lilia was truly asking of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia's smile widened, as if she sensed Agatha's hesitation. "Yes. It’s informal, but it’s an opportunity to see your colleagues in a different light, outside the OR or the office. People get to relax, share ideas, talk about things that aren’t strictly related to the hospital. It’s about fostering a sense of unity."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze flickered with something akin to mild amusement. "Unity." She let the word linger in the air, as though testing its weight. “And this... tradition, is it meant to build trust, or just to ensure no one feels too isolated?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia leaned forward slightly, folding her hands together. "Both, in a way. Trust is built over time, and this is just one way to do it. I know it might seem trivial, but these moments have a way of making the team feel more cohesive. I’ve found it to be valuable, especially for those of us who tend to be… driven, like you." She paused, watching Agatha carefully. “You don’t have to attend if you’d rather not, but it could help you with the transition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze narrowed ever so slightly, but she kept her tone level. “I’m here to make an impact, not to participate in feel good rituals. I don’t see how dinner will change anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s eyes softened, but there was a quiet insistence in her voice. "I understand your focus, Agatha. Trust me, I do. But sometimes, how we build those impacts, how we work with others, can make all the difference in the long run. You’re not just leading the team; you’re becoming part of it. A dinner may be a small gesture, but it could go a long way in making sure you’re not seen as an outsider."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers twitched as she considered Lilia’s words. She had never been good at navigating the nuances of workplace culture, especially when it veered into the territory of forced camaraderie. But she also understood the politics at play. Building alliances, even subtly, could prove useful in the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed inwardly, not giving any outward sign of her reluctance. "I’ll think about it," she said, her tone measured but polite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia grinned. "I’ll take that as a tentative yes. I’ll send you the details."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia stood, smoothing her suit jacket as she extended her hand again. "I won’t keep you. I’m sure you’ve got a full schedule already. Just remember, my door’s always open."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her hand, noting the firm but friendly grip. As she turned to leave, she glanced back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And, Dr. Harkness? You’ll do great here. I’ve got a good feeling about it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door clicked shut behind her, Agatha sat back in her chair, exhaling slowly. The meeting had been a test, she knew, a way for Dr Calderu to gauge what kind of leader she would be. But if this was her first glimpse of how things worked in Minnesota, she was cautiously optimistic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a quick glance at the clock, Agatha stood up, smoothing down her lab coat. She had a few minutes before she had to leave to pick up Nicky from the daycare. The kid had been with a sitter for the last few hours, and she was itching to get home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stepped out of the hospital, the chill of the Minnesota air hit her, and she adjusted her coat against the breeze. The morning had been long, filled with meetings and patient rounds, but now she finally had a few minutes to herself. She was looking forward to a cup of coffee and a pastry for Nicky before heading to pick him up from daycare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The familiar scent of roasting beans greeted her as she approached the small coffee shop just down the street. When she reached the entrance of the coffee shop, she paused to pull out her phone and check the time again. She didn’t have much, but a quick coffee and a pastry for Nicky wouldn’t take long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she stepped back outside, coffee cup in hand, bam. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something, someone, collided with her. The impact sent her stumbling back, and before she could process what was happening, her coffee was splashed all over the front of her lab coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What the hell?" Agatha snapped, her body tensing as she surveyed the mess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she saw her: a woman standing there, wide-eyed and apologetic, her hand raised as if to steady her. But it wasn’t the woman who caught Agatha’s attention, it was the small, scruffy dog tugging on a leash, practically weaving in and out of the woman’s legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” the woman said, voice casual, too casual for Agatha’s taste.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her jaw clenched, her patience already running thin. She wasn’t in the mood for this. The coffee was ruined, her coat now a mess, and the last thing she needed was some random stranger acting like this was nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you fucking blind?” Agatha snapped, her voice cutting through the air, her eyes locking with the woman’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman blinked, clearly taken off guard by the venom in Agatha’s voice. “I— sorry, it’s just… he’s all over the place,” she said, glancing down at the dog, who was still yanking at the leash, oblivious to the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wiped at her coat with a sharp huff, her irritation bubbling over. “Yeah, well, maybe you should get him under control,” she bit back, eyeing the woman now, sizing her up. She didn’t even care how the woman looked, disheveled, with dark hair falling haphazardly over her face, or the way she casually stood there like nothing had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you seriously blaming the dog?” the woman asked, her lips curving into a half-amused, half-annoyed smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The audacity. Agatha’s patience was practically nonexistent now. “No,” she said, her voice low and cold, “I’m blaming the idiot who can’t manage their dog.” She stepped back, eyes narrowing. “It’s called being aware of your surroundings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s grin faltered for just a second, replaced by something else in her eyes, curiosity, maybe a little surprise. “Right. Sorry again,” she said, but there was a definite edge of condescension in her voice now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the silence stretch, feeling the tension hang between them like thick air. The woman’s calm indifference was infuriating, and Agatha was done tolerating it. “You know,” she said, voice sharp as a blade, “maybe next time you should actually look where you’re walking instead of just apologizing and moving on like nothing happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman looked her up and down, that same bored expression on her face, but now there was something else in her eyes, a flicker of recognition, or perhaps amusement at how far this confrontation had escalated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, aren't we charming?” the woman said with a smirk, stepping back slightly, her dog still pulling at the leash, oblivious to the tension in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze was icy, her fists clenched, fighting the urge to snap back. She wasn’t in the mood to entertain this woman’s casual disregard for basic decency. She had more important things to do than get into a pissing contest with a stranger over a spilled coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, something about the woman’s smugness was making Agatha’s blood boil. She was about to turn on her heel, walk away, and forget about it when the woman spoke again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” the woman said, her tone light, but there was a sharp edge creeping into her voice now, “maybe you should consider taking it down a notch. You’re the one who lost your coffee, not the end of the world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “I didn’t lose my coffee, you spilled it.” The words were clipped, the bite in her voice unmistakable. She was done with this. Done with the woman’s casual attitude, her infuriating smirk, and the way she acted as if this was some small, insignificant incident when it had completely ruined Agatha’s moment of peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s smile flickered, but she didn’t back down. Instead, she glanced down at her dog, still happily tugging at the leash, and then back at Agatha, her expression unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I guess I’m sorry for your ruined coat, then,” she said with a half-shrug, her voice dripping with an almost sarcastic sweetness. “I didn’t realize a little coffee was such a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her blood start to boil again, but she controlled it, forcing her features to remain calm. “It’s not just coffee,” she replied, her voice cold, “It’s about being respectful of the people around you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman tilted her head, still not apologizing in any real way. Instead, she took a step back, as if the confrontation had long since lost its heat for her, her dog still tugging at the leash.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” she said, the words drawn out as if to emphasize the point. “Well, next time, I’ll make sure to step aside just for you. Wouldn't want to mess up your precious coat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There it was again, her tone. The casual dismissiveness that made Agatha want to explode. But she didn’t. She fought it, standing firm, glaring at the woman for a moment longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got a real attitude problem,” Agatha muttered under her breath, turning on her heel and walking toward the entrance of the coffee shop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman called after her, voice still too calm for Agatha’s liking. “Yeah, well, you’ve got a temper problem. Might want to work on that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t bother responding. She didn’t need to waste another second on this woman. But as she stepped into the shop, her mind was racing, still tangled in the absurdity of the interaction. Something about that woman, her attitude, her unflappable calm, had dug under Agatha’s skin in a way that left her unsettled. But Agatha wasn’t the type to dwell on it. She had more important things to focus on. Or at least, she tried to convince herself of that as she moved to order another coffee, the memory of the woman and her irritating dog already beginning to fade, just slightly.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha’s hands were still shaking from the encounter outside the coffee shop, but she forced herself to focus. The last thing she needed was to bring any of her frustration home. She couldn’t let herself unravel just yet—not with Nicky waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drove to the daycare. The low hum of the car’s engine and the soft sound of the radio were the only things keeping her grounded. Her mind kept replaying the confrontation with the woman outside the shop—the woman with the dog, the woman who dared to act so indifferent. It was almost like a challenge, one that Agatha hadn’t signed up for. But she didn’t have time to dwell on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she walked through the door, she saw Nicky. His mop of curly hair and bright eyes stood out among the other children. He was sitting at a little table, scribbling away with crayons, completely engrossed in his task. Agatha’s heart softened. No matter how tough the day had been, seeing him like this always had a way of easing her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama!” Nicky exclaimed when he saw her, dropping his crayon as he rushed over. He flung his arms around her, and Agatha bent down to lift him into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How was your day, buddy?” she asked, smiling as she hugged him tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was awesome! I made a rocket ship!” Nicky said, his eyes wide with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, taking the drawing from him as he held it out proudly. “A rocket ship, huh? Let me see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The picture was full of bright colors and wild shapes—nothing like a real rocket, but to Nicky, it was perfect. “It’s great,” she said, kissing the top of his head. "Let’s get you home, rocket man."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked out of the daycare, the weight of the earlier confrontation melted away. Nicky’s chatter about his day filled the air as Agatha buckled him into his car seat. She focused on the drive home, the road ahead a welcome distraction. She would deal with the rest of her day later, but for now, she just wanted to be with her son, to enjoy the quiet moments before she had to go back to the hospital. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they arrived home, Agatha pulled into the driveway, the car crunching over the gravel as she parked in front of the house. She shifted the car into park, exhaling slowly. It had been a day filled with tension and difficult decisions, but now, with Nicky beside her, she could focus on something that mattered more than any hospital drama.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, rocket man,” Agatha said, unbuckling him from his car seat. “Time to get inside and show me that rocket ship of yours again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned, his excitement barely contained as he scrambled out of the car and ran toward the front door. Agatha followed, locking the car behind her and walking into the house, where the smell of the evening’s dinner—something simple she’d thrown together earlier—hung in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the door behind her, and Nicky dashed into the living room, plopping down on the couch and proudly holding out his drawing. Agatha leaned over, inspecting it again. The colors were wild and the lines all over the place, but it was exactly what she needed—something pure, something that had nothing to do with the pressures of her work or the conflicts she faced today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really think this is going to make it to the moon?” she asked, a teasing smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s already there!” Nicky said, nodding seriously, his face the picture of determination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly, sitting down beside him and pulling him into a hug. She could feel the weight of the day lifting as she focused on the moment, on the simple joys of being with her son. The world outside could wait. For now, this was her space—her home, with Nicky, where she could breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After dinner and some quiet time together, Nicky was ready for bed. He yawned widely as Agatha tucked him in, pulling his favorite blanket up to his chin. She kissed the top of his head, a soft smile on her face as she whispered, “Goodnight, buddy. Sweet dreams.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Night, Mama,” Nicky mumbled, already half asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood for a moment, watching him drift off before gently turning the light down and closing the door behind her. She moved back into the living room, her mind returning to the work she had to do. The quiet of the house was a stark contrast to the tension of the day, and she welcomed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting down at the kitchen table, Agatha opened her laptop and pulled up the profiles of the residents she would be working with. There was a stack of paperwork waiting for her attention, the usual administrative tasks that came with her position. She flipped through the profiles, quickly assessing each resident’s background, their strengths, and areas for improvement. She made mental notes, already formulating a plan to address any weaknesses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some were promising, eager to learn, and ready for the challenges she would bring. Others, Agatha noted with a sharp eye, had potential but needed a firm hand to guide them. It was a task she was used to: shaping the next generation of surgeons, honing their skills, pushing them to be better, to think faster, and to work with precision under pressure</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha worked through the residents' profiles, she couldn’t help but think about how she would approach them. She wasn’t one to hold back, and she didn’t believe in coddling. These residents—whoever they were—would be held to the highest standards. She had a reputation for a reason, and she intended to make sure they knew that. She would break them down if she had to, break down the walls of complacency, ego, and laziness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes narrowed as she skimmed through one particularly overconfident resident’s file. This one, she thought, would be a challenge. They were cocky, probably too much so for his own good. But she could already see the cracks—the little moments where they would fail if given the chance. That’s where she would come in. She would push them, make them realize how much they still had to learn, how far they had to go to reach the level of excellence she demanded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the others, the ones who had potential but weren’t quite there yet? They would need patience—just enough to let them see how capable they could be if they stopped second-guessing themselves. But the pressure would be constant. Every step they took, every decision they made, would be under a microscope. If they didn’t rise to the challenge, she would break them too—metaphorically speaking, of course. She wasn’t here to babysit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no room for weakness in her world. Agatha didn’t have the luxury of softness. She had climbed her way to the top through sheer force of will, and she would make sure these residents understood that nothing less than perfection was acceptable in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made notes, mentally preparing herself for the next day’s rounds, strategizing how to challenge each one. She didn’t do “nice.”. And by the time they left her care, they would be far better than when they started. Or they wouldn’t last. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t waste time on failures.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her laptop with a soft click. The house was quiet again, Nicky tucked safely in his bed, the weight of the day finally settling over her. She stretched, feeling the tension in her shoulders and neck, and then stood up to turn off the lights in the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to the bathroom to wash off the remnants of the day—stress, frustration, and the remnants of coffee still staining her coat. A quick shower, then she slipped into her pajamas, the fabric soft against her skin, a small comfort amidst the chaos of her professional world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha checked on Nicky once more before heading to her own bedroom. She stood for a moment by his door, listening to the soft sound of his breathing. She allowed herself a rare moment of peace before she slipped into her own bed, the cool sheets a welcome relief from the heat of the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in the silence of the night, Agatha finally allowed herself to drift off, the weight of the day lifting as she sank into rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning, Agatha woke early, the crisp morning air slipping through the curtains as daylight crept into the room. Her first on-call day at Mayo Clinic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood and quickly moved to the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face to shake off the remnants of sleep. The day ahead would be full of challenges, and she couldn’t afford to waste a single moment. She moved with purpose, her mind already running through the list of tasks awaiting her in the NICU and OR.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled on her purple scrubs, the fabric smooth and familiar against her skin. They were a uniform, yes, but more than that—a symbol of the expertise and authority she carried with her. The color was bold, and it made her feel ready to face whatever the day threw at her. Her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, and she took a moment to double-check her appearance in the mirror, ensuring everything was in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a quick breakfast, she grabbed her phone to check any messages or updates from the hospital. There was always something that needed her attention. As she scrolled through, a new message from Dr. Calderu appeared.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Good luck on your first on-call day, Agatha. If anything comes up, I’ll be around. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the clock. Time was slipping away, and she still needed to say goodbye to Nicky before she left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked down the hallway to his room, her steps quiet but purposeful. The door creaked slightly as she opened it, finding Nicky already awake, sitting up in his bed with his favorite stuffed animal clutched tightly in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hey, buddy," Agatha said softly, her voice betraying the tenderness she usually kept hidden behind her professional mask. Nicky looked up, his sleepy eyes brightening when he saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mommy!" he exclaimed, reaching out his arms to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled, walking over to his bed and sitting down beside him. She hugged him tightly, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. " I’ve got to go to work today. I won’t be home for a little while, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded solemnly, his small face filled with understanding. "You’ll be back soon?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart clenched at the innocent question. She swallowed, her voice steady but soft. "Yeah, I’ll be back tomorrow. You’ll be with your sitter, and I’ll be thinking about you the whole time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded again, his little face looking more serious than usual. "Okay, Mommy. Be careful."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will, Nicky. I promise." Agatha kissed him again, lingering for a moment as she closed her eyes. "I’ll miss you, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ll miss you too," he whispered back, a small smile tugging at his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood, taking one last look at her son before walking toward the door. She wasn’t sure if it was harder leaving him behind for a shift like this or the fact that she'd be away from him for a full 24 hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Love you, kiddo," she said, her voice tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Love you, Mama," Nicky called back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a deep breath, Agatha closed the door behind her and left the house, her thoughts heavy with the knowledge that she wouldn’t see him for another full day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car ride was quiet, her thoughts focused and calm, but her body was already keyed up for what lay ahead. She arrived at the hospital with time to spare, walking into the building with her usual controlled demeanor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Today, nothing would slip past her. She was ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way to the NICU first, where the team had already gathered, ready to follow her lead. As she approached, she could feel the eyes of the residents and nurses on her—an unspoken expectation, a mix of nerves and respect, as they awaited her direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat and began. "Let's get started. We have a lot to go through and I expect full attention. No distractions, no excuses." Her voice was firm, sharp, and to the point—exactly the way she had learned to command attention in her years of experience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer Kale, the charge nurse, stepped forward. "Dr. Harkness, the babies in isolation are stable for now. No significant changes. We also have a new admission—very premature, 24 weeks."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, already flipping through the patient files. The statistics, the clinical data—it was all in front of her, but the real work would come from the decisions she made. "We’ll start with the premature infant. I want full neonatal support, intubation on standby, and let’s prepare for the possibility of immediate surfactant administration."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer nodded, jotting down notes as the team moved into action. The residents exchanged quick, practiced looks, their faces impassive but focused. They had seen this kind of case before, but this time it was her call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Anyone have any concerns?" Agatha asked, her voice carrying across the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the residents spoke up. "Given the gestational age, we should be careful with aggressive interventions. The risks—"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Risks?" Agatha interrupted, her eyes narrowing as she looked directly at the young resident. "The risk is not acting fast enough. Do you want to be the one explaining why we didn’t give this baby every chance to survive?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Park swallowed, looking down. The tension in the room thickened, and Agatha could feel it, the weight of their expectations and her no-nonsense approach. It wasn’t about making friends here. It was about saving lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Prepare for the surfactant, and let's get moving," Agatha continued, her tone leaving no room for further debate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team scrambled into action, working seamlessly together. Agatha remained calm on the outside, but internally, her mind raced, calculating the next steps, ensuring she didn’t miss a single detail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes later, the infant was stabilized, intubated, and receiving the necessary treatment. Agatha stood back, watching the team work with precision. She allowed herself a brief moment of satisfaction—this was why she was here. The baby’s life was no longer in immediate jeopardy, but the night was far from over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved on to the other cases, making quick, efficient rounds. Despite the weight of the responsibility on her shoulders, Agatha felt a sense of clarity. The job wasn’t easy, but she had spent years training for this very moment. And as the night stretched on, she found herself thriving in the challenge, completely immersed in the work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Keep up the pace," she reminded the team. "We’ll get through this. And when the shift ends, we’ll do it all over again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning passed in a steady, predictable rhythm. Agatha moved through her rounds with practiced efficiency, her focus sharp as ever. The hospital was bustling as usual, but she didn’t get paged to the trauma yet, a rare and welcome break. She used the time to assess the resident profiles further, her mind always thinking several steps ahead. Every moment was another opportunity to refine her plans, but today there was a quiet sense of relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time noon rolled around, Agatha found herself alone in the hospital's staff cafeteria, seated at a small table near the window. The lunch crowd had already come and gone, and now there was only the hum of conversation and clinking silverware around her. She didn't mind the solitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her meal was simple—just a salad and a cup of coffee—but it was enough. She ate without distraction, her mind swirling with the conversations, cases, and decisions she had already made this morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pager buzzed, a sharp reminder of the reason she was here. The message was brief: </span>
<b>Trauma, urgent.</b>
</p><p>
<span>Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and sprinted toward the trauma center. The brisk pace of her walk reflected her focus—this was what she signed up for, what she thrived on. Emergencies, the unpredictable nature of it all, the constant need for swift decisions. The steady hum of the hospital around her seemed to fade as she entered the trauma bay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the usual chaos of trauma care was underway: nurses moving swiftly, equipment clattering, doctors barking orders. Agatha’s eyes scanned the room, immediately identifying the severity of the case. A young woman, in his early twenties, was wheeled in on a stretcher, covered in blood. She’d been involved in a severe car accident—multiple broken bones, a likely head injury, and internal bleeding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to the side, gathering her thoughts, when a voice from behind her caught her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Looks like you’ve got your hands full, huh?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to see a tall, confident woman in scrubs, her red hair pulled into a tight ponytail. There was something about her demeanor—focused, calm, but with an edge that suggested she had seen it all. She wore the jacket of a trauma surgeon with ease, like it had been tailor-made for her. Agatha could see the familiar weight of authority in the woman’s stance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Dr. Wanda Maximoff, neurosurgery" the woman said, extending her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took it, shaking firmly. “Dr. Agatha Harkness. Neonatal surgeon. I’m on call today"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded, sizing her up with a quick, calculating glance. "Yes, me too. Well, I hope you’re ready for this. We’ve got a mess on our hands." She motioned to the young man on the stretcher. "Possible intracranial hemorrhage, and his vitals are dropping fast. We need to move quickly if we’re going to save him."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the sharpness of her medical mind clicking into place as she assessed the situation. There wasn’t time for hesitation. She turned to the trauma team and barked out orders. "We need to intubate immediately. Start two large-bore IVs, and get the blood products ready. Let’s get a head CT in progress as soon as possible. This guy doesn’t have long."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team worked with practiced efficiency, but Agatha’s focus was on the patient—and on Dr. Maximoff. She noticed the way she moved, directing the team with ease, offering guidance without overstepping. She was a leader, a natural, in a way that Agatha recognized immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team worked to stabilize the young woman, Wanda stepped closer to Agatha, her voice low. "You seem to know your stuff. This patient’s critical, but I can tell you’re not fazed. You’ve handled trauma before."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond right away. Instead, she focused on the monitor, her eyes narrowed as she checked the vital signs. "I’ve been through worse," she finally said, her voice steady, betraying nothing of the storm that often raged inside her. "But this one’s tricky."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded, watching the monitors too. "I get that. It's always the ones you don’t expect that get you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension in the room was palpable. Every second counted. As the team rushed to keep the young woman stable, Agatha and Wanda moved in sync, each one stepping in when needed, their expertise guiding them through the chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the young woman’s vitals stabilized enough for a CT scan to be done. The results were critical: a large hematoma pressing against the brain, along with signs of hemorrhaging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We need to go to surgery," Wanda said, turning to Agatha. "We’ll do a craniotomy to relieve the pressure. Can you assist me? I know you see mostly premature babies and pregnant women but the rest of the on-call attendings are working on the other OR´s already and this is a complicated case. I dont want a resident assisting me”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her mind already switching gears. "Let’s do it” she said confidently as they started walking to the OR.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The surgery was intense, and the entire team worked in concert, with Dr Maximoff leading the charge. They had to move fast, but with precision. Every incision, every decision had to be perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they closed the patient up, the silence in the room spoke volumes. The young woman was still alive, her chances of survival increased thanks to their combined efforts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned to Agatha as the team finished their work. "Nice work," she said, her tone respectful, though it wasn’t overly effusive. "You’ve got the skill to handle these situations. I can see why Dr Calderu brought you in."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back at her, her expression cool but with a flicker of appreciation. "Same to you," she replied. "You handled that well."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, that was fun," Wanda said, her smirk returning. "You might just be my new favorite surgeon to work with." she said with a wink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small, almost imperceptible smile. "We’ll see how things go next time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Wanda walked off to check on the next patient, Agatha stayed for a moment longer, her mind still buzzing from the adrenaline of the trauma. She hadn’t expected to meet someone like Wanda tonight, but in this world, where egos often collided and tempers flared, it felt... refreshing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night dragged on, the relentless pace of the hospital leaving Agatha on the edge of exhaustion. Despite the adrenaline from the surgeries wearing off, the pressure didn’t relent. Two complex surgeries in one night had left her drained, but it wasn’t just the surgeries that were wearing her down. The residents, in their chaotic attempts to “help,” had only made everything harder. Their lack of experience and inability to follow instructions made her blood boil.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d had enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After her second surgery, she finally collapsed into the break room, trying to shut out the noise and chaos around her. Two hours of sleep had done little to recharge her, and the caffeine buzz had long worn off. She felt a simmering rage building up inside her. The residents’ incompetence had added unnecessary stress to an already overwhelming night. She wasn’t the type to let it slide, and it wasn’t going to happen now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slammed her coffee cup down on the counter, glaring at the clock on the wall. Her mind was racing, her temper barely contained. She needed this to stop, or she was going to break. The lack of respect, the disregard for protocol, it was all getting to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, fighting to keep her composure. She could already hear the voices outside the room—the murmurs of residents discussing cases, as if everything was business as usual. It made her want to tear the walls down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood up, smoothing her scrubs, the last remnants of exhaustion mixing with the overwhelming need to assert control. This was her shift, her domain, and if she had to make it everyone's problem, then so be it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked out of the break room, her eyes scanning the hallway until she spotted the group of residents huddled together near the nurses’ station, laughing about something. She didn’t care what they were laughing at. They hadn’t been doing their jobs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached, her voice cut through the air, icy and sharp. “If you all can’t get your shit together, I’ll make sure you regret it,” she said, the words calculated and lethal. “This is a trauma center, not a playground. Stop wasting my time, and start acting like you belong here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents froze, their laughter dying in an instant. Agatha could feel their nervous glances on her, but she wasn’t about to give them the satisfaction of seeing her flinch. She stood tall, unrelenting, her gaze unwavering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t care if she’d just made enemies. They needed to understand the gravity of the work they were doing. It wasn’t just about the procedures—it was about lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she turned on her heel and strode down the hallway, not bothering to look back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s feet carried her to the coffee station with a sense of purpose. She needed something strong to wake her up, something to erase the lingering frustration from the night. Her mind was still buzzing with the aftermath of the surgeries and the confrontation with the residents. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached the counter, she noticed Dr Maximoff standing near the window, talking to someone. Agatha's tired eyes barely registered the woman at first, but then Wanda spotted her and gave a quick wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha!" Wanda called, her voice cheerful. "Come over here"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, but she walked over, more out of courtesy than curiosity after she got her coffee. As she neared, she noticed the woman Wanda was talking to—a woman she hadn’t quite seen clearly before. She had her back turned to Agatha, but there was something oddly familiar about her posture. The woman was laughing, engaged in a conversation, completely at ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned to her, a smirk tugging at her lips. "Agatha, meet Dr Vidal, orthopedic surgeon”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman turned to face her, and the recognition hit Agatha like a punch to the gut. It was her. The same infuriating woman from the coffee shop—the one who had spilled coffee all over Agatha’s lab coat, the one who had barely apologized before brushing it off as if nothing had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed as the woman looked at her with the same casual demeanor, her lips twitching into a half-smile. "Oh," the woman said, a flicker of recognition passing through her expression as she looked Agatha up and down with a playful smirk forming on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth tightened, her annoyance bubbling up again, but Wanda was already smiling between the two of them, clearly oblivious to the tension she was walking into.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small nod but kept her distance, her fingers tightly gripping her coffee cup. She wasn’t sure what to say. She was still working to keep the nerves from flaring up again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you, Dr Harkness. I’m sure you’ve been quite busy,” she said, almost as if it was an inside joke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t miss the undercurrent of familiarity between the two of them, and the edges of her patience began to fray again. Still, she kept her cool. "Yeah, it’s been a hell of a shift," Agatha responded flatly. "Nice to meet you too."Agatha said stiffly, her tone flat. She didn’t make the effort to hide the sharpness that had come back into her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr Vidal raised an eyebrow but didn’t seem bothered, giving Agatha a cool look. “Yeah I can tell” she replied, her voice holding an edge of amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup, but she kept her posture neutral, her face a careful mask. The woman—Dr. Vidal—wasn't going to get under her skin, not here, not now. She had already dealt with far worse in the hospital than some casual confrontation, but there was something about Dr. Vidal’s presence that grated on her nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Right," Agatha said, her voice cool and measured. "Long shift, lots of cases." She let the words hang in the air, the subtle edge to them making it clear that she wasn’t thrilled to be standing in front of the woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal smiled—calm, unbothered.  "Don’t worry, we all have our days" she said, her tone teasing, as if she was making light of Agatha's irritation, or maybe enjoying it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze, her expression hardening. "Tell me about it," she replied dryly, before lifting her cup to her lips and taking a long, deliberate sip of her coffee. She refused to let her annoyance show any more than it already had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well," Wanda said, looking between the two women, her expression gleaming with curiosity, "I’ll leave you both to it. Got a few things to wrap up before heading home" She clapped her hands together and gave a playful wink to Agatha. "Catch you later, Agatha, Rio. You two can keep each other company. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was about to leave but the infuriating woman spoke first.  So you’re the new chief of the NICU that everyone has been talking about huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her and started walking, refusing to let Dr. Vidal’s words get under her skin. She could feel her pulse quicken, but she wasn’t going to let herself be baited. The nerve of this woman, acting as if she knew her, acting as if she had any right to make judgments. </span>
<em>
<span>Who the hell does she think she is?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She gripped her coffee cup tighter, keeping her eyes fixed ahead as she passed people on her way to the exit of the cafeteria. She didn’t need to dignify Dr. Vidal’s comment with a response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal reached her when she was about to exit the cafeteria . “You know,” she said, tilting her head slightly, “I’m sorry about the coffee. Seriously. But maybe you should take a breath next time before jumping down someone’s throat. Could be good for your blood pressure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. Her pulse quickened, her face hardening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you should mind your business,” Agatha shot back, stepping closer, her eyes narrowed with a newfound sharpness. “I didn’t ask for your opinion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr Vidal didn’t flinch, though her lips curled into a knowing smirk. “Okay, then. I guess I’ll just keep walking, try not to get in your way.” She started to move past Agatha, but before she could completely step around her, she paused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And for the record,” she added with a mischievous glint in her eye, “if you're having a terrible day, maybe don't make it everyone else’s problem. Just a thought.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, her footsteps light and confident, leaving Agatha standing there, fuming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, feeling the simmering heat of her frustration. The woman wasn’t the least bit rattled by Agatha’s confrontation—hell, it looked like she almost </span>
<em>
<span>enjoyed</span>
</em>
<span> it. With a last, lingering glance, she turned and walked away,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand still on the door, every muscle in her body screaming to turn around and lay it all out. Instead, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly, her anger simmering just beneath the surface. She was done with this exchange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without looking back, Agatha pushed open the door and stepped into the cool air outside. She wasn’t going to let someone like Dr. Vidal distract her, not now, not when there were more important things on her mind. If Dr. Vidal wanted to play games, fine. But Agatha wasn’t interested in wasting her time. Not today. Not anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With each step she took, she felt the tension ease, as if putting distance between herself and the woman allowed her to reclaim her focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that she had survived her first 24 hour shift at Mayo Clinic. </span>
</p><p>

<p>
<span>Agatha finally made it home, her body heavy with exhaustion but her mind buzzing with the events of her first 24-hour shift at Mayo Clinic. She tossed her bag onto the nearest chair and exhaled deeply, savoring the quiet sanctuary of her home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of Nicky arriving in the afternoon brought a wave of warmth, a reminder of the parts of her life that grounded her. Before that, though, she needed to shake off the tension still clinging to her muscles. She got out of her scrubs and changed into workout gear and went for a run. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rhythmic cadence of the run and the steady pulse of her workout playlist became a much-needed escape. With each step she took, the frustrations of the morning began to melt away, replaced by a sense of accomplishment—not just from surviving the shift but from finding her footing in this new chapter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she finished, her breathing was steady, her mind calmer. She grabbed a quick shower and settled in with a light snack, anticipation bubbling as she thought of Nicky’s arrival. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a quick lunch and a glance at the clock, Agatha grabbed her car keys and headed out to pick him up from daycare. The drive was peaceful, a welcome change from the chaos of the hospital and the whirlwind of her thoughts earlier in the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled into the daycare parking lot, the familiar sight of children playing in the yard brought a smile to her face. She stepped out of the car and walked toward the building, already eager to see Nicky's excited grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the daycare staff greeted her warmly. As always, the sound of laughter and chatter filled the air. Moments later, Nicky appeared, his little face lighting up when he saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mommy!" he exclaimed, running toward her with arms wide open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crouched down to scoop him up, her heart swelling at the sheer joy in his voice. "Hey, buddy! Did you have fun today?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded enthusiastically, already launching into a story about his day—complete with dramatic reenactments and a tangle of half-formed sentences only a parent could follow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, holding him close as they walked back to the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The afternoon was a cozy whirlwind of flour, sugar, and giggles as Agatha and Nicky set about making cookies together. Nicky insisted on using every cookie cutter they owned—stars, hearts, dinosaurs, and even a lopsided snowman that he said looked "like Olaf."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha guided his little hands as they pressed shapes into the dough, her laughter bubbling up every time he tried to sneak a piece of raw cookie dough into his mouth. By the time the cookies were in the oven, both of them were covered in a fine dusting of flour, their cheeks pink from the warmth of the kitchen and their shared laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the cookies cooled, they settled on the couch with a plate of their creations and a glass of milk for Nicky. He grabbed the remote and beamed up at her. "Can we watch Frozen, Mommy? Please?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, ruffling his hair. "Of course, buddy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky clambered onto her lap as the familiar opening notes of </span>
<em>
<span>Frozen</span>
</em>
<span> began to play. Together, they sang along to </span>
<em>
<span>Let It Go,</span>
</em>
<span> with Nicky dramatically waving his arms like Elsa casting her ice powers. Agatha couldn’t help but join in, laughing at his enthusiasm and her own slightly off-key performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the credits rolled, Nicky was curled up against her, his eyes drooping. Agatha kissed the top of his head, savoring the quiet moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back on the couch, her arm draped protectively around Nicky as he slept, his little chest rising and falling with each peaceful breath. She glanced at the remnants of their afternoon—a plate of half-eaten cookies, flour smudges still on the counter, and the faint echo of </span>
<em>
<span>Let It Go</span>
</em>
<span> lingering in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in a long while, she felt a quiet sense of accomplishment. Not as a doctor or a leader, but as a mother. The chaos of her life often made her question if she was doing enough for Nicky, if she was present enough, patient enough, </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span> enough. But moments like these, filled with his laughter and the warmth of his trust, reminded her that she was trying—and succeeding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stroked Nicky’s hair, her heart swelling with love and resolve. She was doing her best, and for him, that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After putting Nicky to bed and tidying up the living room, Agatha made her way to her bedroom. The day had been long but rewarding, and she was ready to unwind. As she reached for the laundry basket, her hand brushed against the fabric of her coat, now marked with a large, brown coffee stain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, staring at it. The sight of the stain brought the memory rushing back—the coffee shop, the collision, and Dr. Vidal’s maddening smirk. Agatha’s jaw tightened as her mind replayed the woman’s unapologetic demeanor and flippant remarks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” she muttered under her breath, yanking the coat off the chair and inspecting the stain. Her annoyance reignited as if no time had passed. Who did Dr. Vidal think she was, waltzing into Agatha’s life with that smug attitude and audacious comments?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tossed the coat into the laundry pile with a little more force than necessary. Shaking her head, she tried to dismiss the thoughts. </span>
<em>
<span>Not worth my time,</span>
</em>
<span> she reminded herself, heading to the closet to find her workout gear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she pulled her sneakers on the shelf, the memory of Dr. Vidal’s parting words lingered.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Not everyone’s having a terrible day. Just saying."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temple. There was something infuriatingly intriguing about the woman’s confidence, a challenge in her words that stuck with Agatha longer than it should.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went into her office and turned on her laptop before she could second guess herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for a moment, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. She could almost hear her own inner voice questioning her motives, but curiosity—or perhaps the need to understand her new adversary—won out.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Just to know what I’m dealing with,"</span>
</em>
<span> she told herself, her excuse flimsy even in her own mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a deliberate exhale, she typed into the search bar: </span>
<b>Dr. Rio Vidal.</b>
</p><p>
<span>The results popped up almost immediately. Articles, profiles, awards—it was all there. Rio Vidal, orthopaedic surgeon, renowned for her groundbreaking techniques in minimally invasive heart surgery. Agatha’s brows furrowed as she skimmed the headlines.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Johns Hopkins Surgeon Transforming Orthopedic Care.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Dr. Rio Vidal: Redefining Precision in Orthopedic Surgery.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Vidal’s Revolutionary Approach to Orthopedic Surgery Saves Lives Globally.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line. Of course. Dr. Vidal wasn’t just confident—she had the credentials to back it up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clicked on the Mayo Clinic website, scrolling through a picture of the woman standing confidently in scrubs, arms crossed, her smirk unmistakable even in a formal photograph.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even in her employee photo, that same damn smirk lingered—cocky, bold. The one that had irked Agatha earlier.  She looked incredibly young to have earned these credentials. That alone seemed unusual. How old was she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scanned the details, her brow furrowing as she read further. No Ivy League school for her undergrad; a</span>
<span> Bachelor of Science degree in Plant Biology at North Carolina State University, interesting</span>
<span>. But there was Johns Hopkins for med school straight out of undergrad, followed by a residency in orthopaedic surgery at the same hospital. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Figures,” Agatha muttered under her breath, feeling her irritation simmering again. But there was something more, something beneath the irritation—a grudging respect she wasn’t quite ready to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she read on, she found herself drawn in despite herself. Vidal’s career was impressive, no doubt about it. But it didn’t erase the fact that she was infuriatingly smug and unapologetic. The memory of her smirk at the coffee shop flashed through Agatha’s mind again, reigniting her frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed the laptop with a decisive snap. She wasn’t about to let this infuriating woman live rent-free in her mind any longer tonight. Pushing back from the desk, she resolved to get some sleep. But as she lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, she couldn’t quite shake the feeling that this wouldn’t be the last time Dr. Vidal got under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While she was laying in the comfort of her bed staring at the ceiling as the events of the day looped through her mind like an unrelenting movie reel. The shift had been grueling, the daycare pick-up a much-needed balm, and the afternoon with Nicky pure joy. But as satisfying as it was to be home and savoring the calm, her thoughts kept snagging on one infuriating thread: Dr. Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t pinpoint what made her angrier—the unapologetic smirk, the casual dismissal of her frustration, or the fact that someone like Vidal had managed to unsettle her at all. Agatha prided herself on her composure, her ability to stay one step ahead, to maintain control. That control had been hard-won through years of medical school, residency, her marriage and motherhood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet somehow, in the span of a single coffee-stained moment, Vidal had managed to throw her completely off balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a frustrated sigh, Agatha shifted under the covers. It wasn’t just the coffee spill or the maddeningly confident attitude. No, it was the way Vidal had seemed to see her—to call out her bad day with a flippant comment that stuck like a burr.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“maybe you should take a breath next time before jumping down someone’s throat. Could be good for your blood pressure.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Who says that to a stranger? To a colleague even? And who waltzes into a hospital with that level of swagger, acting as if the world owed them admiration? Agatha rolled onto her side, her jaw tightening. She hated people like that—people who thrive on chaos, who embraced uncertainty with open arms. It was the antithesis of everything Agatha had built her life around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Control was her armor. Her meticulously scheduled days, her color-coded calendar, even the way she folded Nicky’s clothes into neat little squares—it was all part of her system, her fortress against the unpredictable. And now here was Vidal, crashing through that carefully constructed fortress like a hurricane, leaving coffee stains and cocky smirks in her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind replayed the moment she’d looked up Vidal’s resume. That smirk in her employee photo—it was almost taunting. As if Vidal knew she was difficult to pin down, impossible to predict.She found herself trying to parse every detail in the photo. Was the smirk deliberate? Was it an act of defiance? Or was Vidal genuinely one of those people who found the world endlessly amusing, and Agatha had just happened to be the punchline that day?</span>
</p><p>
<span>How had she done it? How had she made it this far, this fast? Agatha couldn’t help but wonder what sacrifices Vidal had made along the way. Or did Vidal just have it all figured out—charm, brilliance, and the kind of confidence that made people want to follow her lead? It was maddening to think about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind circled back to Vidal’s career achievements. The articles written about her, the awards she had won, the glowing praise. It all added up to someone who was clearly exceptional, a rising star in her field. Agatha hated to admit it, but Vidal’s résumé was intimidating. She wasn’t just talented—she was innovative, a trailblazer. And young, too. Younger than Agatha had expected. </span>
<em>
<span>How old was she? </span>
</em>
<span>That part stung more than she cared to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How did someone like Vidal—</span>
<em>
<span>what, in her early thirties mid thirties at most</span>
</em>
<span>—already become chief of a department? Agatha felt a pang of frustration. It had taken her years of grueling work, sacrifices, and navigating a labyrinth of hospital politics to get where she was. Her first time leading a department hadn’t come until she was forty-one. Now, five years later, she was in her second leadership role, proud of the role she was taking but acutely aware of the cost it had taken to get there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every step had been hard-earned, every achievement fought for tooth and nail. There were no shortcuts, no strokes of luck—just relentless effort. The late nights spent agonizing over cases, the holidays she’d missed, the birthdays she’d forgotten, and the friendships she’d let fade. She had poured everything into her career, giving pieces of herself she could never reclaim.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had even cost her her marriage, for God’s sake. The thought twisted in her chest, a familiar ache she had learned to live with. Her ex-husband had once said she married her work, and maybe he wasn’t entirely wrong. Being a surgeon, a well recognized one —it wasn’t just a job. It was an identity, a calling, and she’d answered it, fully and without hesitation, the goal she knew she wanted to achieve since she was in high school. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood there, looking at the ceiling if it were somehow to blame for her spiraling thoughts. Vidal made it look effortless, as if she had simply walked into her success. That smirk, that maddeningly self-assured attitude—it all screamed privilege, or at least luck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands tightened into fists.</span>
<em>
<span> Was it luck? </span>
</em>
<span>Or had Vidal truly outworked everyone around her? The thought twisted in her gut. If it was the latter, it felt like a judgment, a reminder of the time Agatha might have wasted second-guessing herself, playing it safe, or trying to balance too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed heavily, running a hand through her hair. The truth was, Vidal’s success wasn’t her failure. Was it fair to compare? Probably not. But fairness didn’t stop the sting of knowing that someone nearly a decade younger had seemingly skipped the trenches she’d had to wade through; it didn’t stop the little voice in her head from whispering that Vidal had somehow lapped her in the race, and with a cocky smirk to boot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Whatever," Agatha muttered, standing up abruptly. She didn’t need to think about Vidal anymore tonight. She had her own accomplishments to be proud of—accomplishments she had worked damn hard for. Let Vidal have her smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as much as Agatha hated to admit it, there was something else beneath the frustration. A flicker of curiosity. An uncomfortable, grudging respect. Vidal was everything Agatha couldn’t stand—and yet, everything she couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That thought was the most unsettling of all. Agatha didn’t like people getting under her skin, didn’t like feeling out of control. And Vidal had managed to do both in record time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Turning onto her back, Agatha exhaled sharply. “I don’t have time for this,” she muttered aloud, as if saying the words could banish Vidal from her thoughts. She had enough on her plate without adding a maddening, overly confident surgeon to the mix.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But deep down, Agatha knew the truth. Vidal wasn’t the type to fade into the background. She was a challenge—and Agatha hated leaving a challenge unanswered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made her stomach tighten, a mix of irritation and anticipation curling in her chest. She would have to face Vidal again, and when that happened, she needed to be ready. No more letting the woman catch her off guard. Next time, Agatha would hold the upper hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Resolving to push the matter aside for now, she closed her eyes and focused on her breathing, willing herself to relax. But even as sleep crept in, Vidal’s smirk lingered in the corners of her mind, a sharp reminder that some storms can’t be contained—and some battles can’t be ignored.</span>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The next morning, Agatha woke up to the faint sound of Nicky stirring in his room. For a moment, she lingered in bed, savoring the stillness before the day began. But even as she mentally outlined her schedule—rounds, a patient consultation, an administration of the NICU meeting—the thought of Vidal intruded, as sharp and unwelcome as the coffee stain on her coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed, rolling out of bed and pulling on a sweatshirt. It was too early for this. Yet, as she padded into the kitchen to start breakfast, her mind picked up the thread from the night before. Vidal wasn’t just infuriating; she was a wildcard. And Agatha didn’t do well with wildcards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Nicky bounded into the kitchen, babbling about dinosaurs and asking for pancakes, Agatha had managed to push most of her irritation aside. She focused on flipping pancakes and helping him decide between syrup or fruit. These moments grounded her. They reminded her of why she worked so hard, why she pushed herself to be better every day. Nicky deserved stability, love, and a mother who was present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, as she dropped Nicky off at daycare and drove toward the hospital, the tightness in her chest returned. She didn’t want to admit it, but Vidal had sparked something in her—an unease, yes, but also a challenge. And if there was one thing Agatha couldn’t resist, it was the need to prove herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she entered the hospital, the familiar rhythm of her day began to take over. The sterile smell of antiseptic, the faint hum of monitors, and the steady stream of nurses and residents greeting her brought a sense of order. This was her domain, the place where she thrived. She didn’t have time for distractions here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But fate, it seemed, had other plans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the rounds had ended Agatha found herself adjusting a plan for one of her little patients of the NICU.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” nurse Kale called as Agatha reviewed a patient chart near the nurses’ station. “We’ve got a call. There’s someone asking for you in the consultation room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up, frowning. “Who is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t say. Just mentioned it was urgent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened. Urgent? That could mean anything—a sudden consult, a patient’s worried family member, or worse. She closed the chart and handed it off, her mind already cycling through possibilities as she headed down the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she pushed the door open, her stomach sank.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There she was. Dr. Vidal, leaning casually against the center table, arms crossed, and of course that same maddening smirk playing on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, Harkness,” Vidal said, her voice smooth and infuriatingly self-assured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her spine stiffen, her grip tightening on the doorframe. “Dr. Vidal,” she said, her tone sharp, “I don’t have time for this, so let’s get to the point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s smirk widened, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Good to see you too,” she replied, unbothered by Agatha’s curt greeting. Vidal shrugged, her expression almost playful. “I thought it was time we had a proper introduction. Considering how well our first encounter went.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “You spilled coffee on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically, you walked into me,” Vidal countered, her tone light. “But I’ll let you have this one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed the door behind her, crossing her arms. “If you have something to say, get to the point. I’m busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal chuckled, her gaze steady. “I’m sure you are. But being busy doesn’t mean we can’t coexist, does it? We’re colleagues now, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Colleagues. The word landed like a challenge. Agatha fought to keep her composure, refusing to rise to the bait. “Is that why you’re here? To discuss ‘coexisting’?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Partly,” Vidal admitted, her smirk softening into something more genuine—or maybe Agatha was imagining it. “I’ve heard about you, Dr Harkness. Everyone here talks about how sharp, driven, and focused you are. I wanted to see for myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, searching Vidal’s face for any hint of insincerity. But Vidal’s expression remained open, almost curious. It threw Agatha off balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And?” she asked, her voice cooler than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s smirk returned, sharper this time. “You’re exactly as intense as they said you’d be”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, unsure how to respond. She wasn’t used to compliments — especially not from people like Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t need your approval,” she said finally, her voice firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal straightened, nodding as if she’d expected that answer. “I’m sure you don’t. But I thought we should clear the air. We’re going to be working together, after all. Might as well figure out how to make it work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed back, crossing her arms tighter as if creating a physical barrier between them. “I don’t see the point of this conversation, Dr. Vidal,” she said curtly. “We’re professionals. We’ll work together when necessary and that’s that. No need for personal theatrics.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal tilted her head, an amused glint in her eye. “No theatrics, huh?” she echoed. “Well, I suppose that depends on how you define it. I just thought it might be helpful to establish some common ground.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Common ground?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, her voice dripping with skepticism. “I wasn’t aware we had any. You work on bones I see mostly babies and pregnant women”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal laughed softly, the sound as smooth and maddening as her smirk. “We’re both here to do our jobs as leaders of our departments, aren’t we? That seems like a good enough start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t buying it. Vidal’s nonchalance felt too calculated, her charm too deliberate. “If you think flattery or casual chit-chat is going to make me forget the way you waltzed in here as if you own the place, think again,” she said, her tone sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t flinch. Instead, her smirk softened into something closer to genuine amusement. “Noted,” she said simply. “But for the record, I don’t ‘waltz’—I stride. Confidently” she paused, a smirk forming in her lips “and if i recall correctly one of us is new here" she paused "and its not me” she said slowly, savoring the worlds</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her cheeks warm despite herself, irritation and something she couldn’t quite name twisting in her chest. “Is there anything else, or can I get back to work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal took a step back, hands raised in mock surrender. “I’ll leave you to it, Dr Harkness. For now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For now?” Agatha echoed, her eyes narrowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s smirk returned, full force. “We’re bound to cross paths again. Something tells me it’ll be… interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled, but before she could respond, Vidal was already halfway out the door, her laugh echoing behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the door clicked shut, Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Vidal was going to be a problem—a challenge she couldn’t avoid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, there was something about Vidal that stuck with her, like a splinter under the skin. It wasn’t just the smirk or the confidence. It was the way she carried herself, as if the world couldn’t touch her. As if she knew something Agatha didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, trying to refocus. She had a full day ahead—a patient recovering from surgery, an administrative report due by noon, and a meeting with the department heads in the afternoon. Vidal didn’t fit anywhere in her schedule.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, as much as Agatha tried to will her out of her mind, Vidal lingered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts churned as she pulled up the day’s patient list on her tablet. Driven. Intense. Focused. Vidal’s words echoed in her mind. Agatha didn’t know whether to feel flattered or patronized. Probably both. She wasn’t used to being analyzed like that, not outside of her performance reviews. And certainly not by someone she’d just met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why does she care what I’m like? Agatha thought. Why is she pushing my buttons?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The idea that Vidal might see her as some kind of challenge made Agatha’s stomach tighten. She hated being underestimated—or worse, being studied like she was some sort of puzzle to be solved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as her irritation grew, so did her curiosity. Who was Dr. Rio Vidal, really? The articles had painted her as a rising star, but they didn’t explain the person behind the accolades. What drove her? What was it like to operate with such confidence?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought gnawed at Agatha throughout the morning, resurfacing during rounds and even as she delivered a post-op update to a patient’s family. Her usually precise focus felt unsteady, her mind darting back to Vidal’s grin, her challenge, her maddening presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By lunchtime, Agatha had had enough. She grabbed her tray from the cafeteria line and found a quiet corner to sit, determined to regain control over her thoughts. Control was what she excelled at, after all. Control was what kept her sane in the chaos of her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she picked at her salad, her phone buzzed with a new email. She glanced down, expecting another reminder from administration, but froze when she saw the sender.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Dr. Rio Vidal.</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. She hesitated for a moment, debating whether to open it. But curiosity won out, as it always did.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Subject: Thought You Might Like This</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Message:</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Dr Harkness,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I noticed you’re on the committee for procedural innovation grants. I recently published a case study on minimally invasive fracture repairs in high-risk OBGYN patients that might interest you. Let me know if you’d like to discuss.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Best,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dr Vidal”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Attached was a PDF. Short, professional, and completely without the cocky tone Agatha had come to associate with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the email, her mind racing. Was this a genuine professional gesture? Or another way for Vidal to insert herself into Agatha’s life?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the attachment, scanning the document quickly. It was impressive, she had to admit—meticulously detailed and thoroughly researched. But that only made her more suspicious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was this Vidal’s way of asserting dominance? Of showing off her brilliance? Or was it something else entirely?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s appetite vanished as she reread the email. She didn’t know what Vidal’s game was, but she was determined to find out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fine, she thought, closing her laptop with a snap. Two can play this game.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day passed in a blur, Agatha’s thoughts half on her patients and half on her growing determination to understand Vidal. By the time her department meeting rolled around, she felt more composed, more in control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That is, until she walked into the conference room and saw Vidal sitting at the table, chatting casually with the other surgeons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal looked up as Agatha entered, her smirk returning as their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squared her shoulders and lifted her chin, refusing to let Vidal see even a flicker of the unease brewing beneath her composed exterior. She greeted the room with a curt nod, her voice steady as she said, “Good afternoon, everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding into her seat, she avoided Vidal’s gaze and began organizing her notes. The other surgeons exchanged pleasantries, but Agatha stayed focused on the papers in front of her. She wasn’t about to indulge Vidal with attention—or worse, let her see how rattled she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” Vidal’s voice cut through the low hum of conversation, smooth as ever. “Dr. Calderu  was just telling me about the recent developments in procedural integration. Your work on optimizing team efficiency at NYU has really set a standard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for half a second, her pen hovering above the page. Was that... a compliment? She looked up, her expression guarded. Vidal’s face was unreadable, though her eyes still carried that spark of mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha replied coolly, her tone professional. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Modest,” Vidal said, leaning back in her chair with an infuriatingly relaxed posture. “But effective. It’s no wonder your department ran so smoothly. Or thats what the streets are saying anyways”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the eyes of her colleagues shift between the two of them, the air in the room charged with an undercurrent of curiosity. Was this some kind of power play? A public acknowledgment meant to keep her off balance?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha said, forcing a small smile, “I strive for excellence here. I’m sure I’ll bring the same level of success to the NICU here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s lips twitched, her smirk softening into something that almost resembled genuine amusement. “That’s the goal,” she replied, her voice warm but edged with something Agatha couldn’t quite place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The meeting began, and for a while, Agatha managed to immerse herself in the agenda. Discussions of resource allocation, upcoming procedures, and departmental goals filled the room. But every so often, she felt Vidal’s gaze on her—a steady, measured presence that was impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the meeting ended, Agatha’s head was spinning. She gathered her things quickly, determined to leave before Vidal could corner her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she stepped into the hallway, a voice called out behind her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Harkness, wait up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze for half a beat before turning, her expression carefully blank. Rio Vidal was strolling toward her, the deliberate ease of her steps setting Agatha’s teeth on edge. That small, almost disarming smile was plastered across her face, but something sharper gleamed in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it, Dr. Vidal?” Agatha asked, her tone clipped and cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal stopped a few steps away, tilting her head as though appraising a puzzle she hadn’t quite solved. “Relax,” she said, her voice tinged with amusement. “I’m not here to start a fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha replied curtly, crossing her arms. “Because if you were, you wouldn’t win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned a low chuckle. Vidal’s smile deepened, but there was an edge to it. “God, you’re fun when you’re defensive.” She lingered, her gaze sweeping over Agatha in a way that felt just shy of insolent. “But no, really. I meant what I said earlier. Impressive work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “If you’re trying to butter me up, Vidal, don’t bother. Compliments are cheap, and I don’t need your approval.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s smile didn’t falter, but a flicker of something—annoyance or respect—flashed behind her eyes. She stepped closer, invading Agatha’s space just enough to make her bristle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Approval?” Vidal echoed, her tone sharp but controlled. “Don’t flatter yourself, Harkness. I’m just giving credit where it’s due. Doesn’t mean I’m lining up to be your cheerleader.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glare hardened. Compliments from Vidal always felt like a setup, a smooth path with an unseen drop-off. “And you’re telling me this because…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal shrugged, her casual tone undercut by a teasing glint in her eyes. “I don’t know. Maybe I thought it’d be nice to acknowledge we’re both damn good at what we do. Or maybe I just wanted to see how long you’d keep glaring at me like I stole your favorite pen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, shifting her weight but holding her ground. “You’re assuming I have a favorite pen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you definitely do,” Vidal said slowly, savoring each word, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Probably something expensive and unnecessarily intimidating. Just like you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her breath. The jab hit closer to home than she cared to admit, but she kept her expression carefully neutral. “Do you have a point, or are you just enjoying wasting my time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I enjoy lots of things,” Vidal said lightly, taking one last calculated step closer. “But no, I’m serious. That paper I sent you earlier—it’s good. Let me know if you ever want to discuss it. We both know collaboration isn’t exactly your strong suit, but it could be… entertaining to try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, suspicion and irritation warring with something else she refused to name. Vidal’s smile softened—just enough to feel dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you think?” Vidal added, her voice low, playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s tone was icy. “I think I’d rather staple my hand to my desk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal laughed, the sound genuine and annoyingly warm, sending a flutter of irritation—or something else—through Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible,” Vidal said, shaking her head as she turned to leave. “Goodnight Dr Harkness”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Vidal walk away, her shoulders set with the kind of confidence that made Agatha’s blood simmer. That laugh—light, infuriatingly genuine—echoed in her head like a song she couldn’t shake.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Smooth bastard. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Imposible. The word clung to her, both a dismissal and a challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned sharply on her heel, jaw clenched, fuming inside. Her steps echoed down the corridor as she headed toward her office, determined to put the interaction out of her mind. But Vidal’s words lingered like a thorn under her skin. </span>
<em>
<span>We both know collaboration isn’t your strong suit.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The nerve of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slamming her office door shut behind her, Agatha threw her coat over the back of her chair and leaned against the desk, exhaling sharply. Her fingers gripped the edge, knuckles whitening as she replayed the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t need to justify herself to Vidal, of all people. Yet the way Vidal had looked at her, all sharp edges wrapped in disarming charm, made her chest tighten with something she couldn’t quite name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Collaboration. Agatha almost laughed aloud at the thought. If Vidal thought she could waltz into her life with smirks and half-hearted compliments, she had another thing coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gathered her belongings with practiced efficiency and headed to her car, the weight of the day pressing heavily on her shoulders. Sliding into the driver’s seat, she exhaled sharply, gripping the steering wheel for a moment before reaching for the ignition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was about to start the engine, her phone buzzed. The screen lit up with a notification—</span>
<em>
<span>Message from Dr. Calderu.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Good afternoon Agatha. The dinner of the heads of the surgery departments is this Friday at 8:00. Ill send you the details. hope to see you there”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed as she read the message, her thumb hovering over the screen. A dinner with the heads of surgery departments? While she understood the importance of networking and maintaining collegial relationships, she wasn’t in the mood for socializing—especially after the day she’d had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, ignoring Dr. Calderu’s invitation wasn’t an option. These events carried weight, a chance to solidify her position and demonstrate her commitment to the team. Not to mention, skipping it might be seen as rude or uncooperative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could second guess herself her fingers moved to type a response.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Thank you for letting me know, Dr. Calderu. I’ll be there.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send, then leaned back against the headrest of her car, letting out a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dinner with department heads. Great. Just what she needed—a night of polite small talk, half-hearted laughs, and the underlying tension of professional politics.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind drifted to the inevitable interactions she’d face. Would Vidal be there? The thought immediately irritated her. Of course Vidal would be there. She seemed like the kind of person who thrived in those environments, effortlessly charming everyone while leaving Agatha feeling off-balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shaking her head, Agatha started the car and pulled out of the hospital parking lot. She told herself she’d deal with Friday when it came. Right now, she needed a long shower, a quiet evening, and a moment to clear her head from Vidal’s maddening presence.</span>

<p>
<span>As Agatha reached for the wheel, ready to go home to Nicky, the phone on her bag buzzed again—this time, an emergency alert. Her eyes flicked to the screen, and her pulse quickened slightly as she read the message.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Dr. Harkness, we have a trauma case involving a pregnant woman coming in; a car accident with an apparent partial amputation of one of her legs. They need you for immediate evaluation and surgery."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her first instinct was to curse under her breath. Nickys nanny would have to put him to bed. Technically she wasn't on call today but she had the knowledge and the skill needed on this case.  She had no choice but to answer the call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a tight, controlled exhale, Agatha grabbed her phone, shot a quick text to the sitter, and then moved swiftly into the hospital. Her heels clicked decisively against the polished floors as she made her way into the trauma bay, the weight of her responsibility settling onto her shoulders. Every second counted in neonatal surgery, and there was no room for hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pregnant woman, unconscious and pale, was being wheeled in, a team of ER nurses and doctors surrounding her. The crash had been severe, and Agatha could already see signs of the woman’s injuries. She was in critical condition—bruising on her abdomen, dangerously low blood pressure, and her right leg… Agatha’s breath hitched for a second as she took it in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The leg was a disaster. The bone of her femur had punched through the skin, jagged and gleaming white under the harsh fluorescent lights, surrounded by a halo of torn flesh and pooling blood. The exposed bone looked stark against the mottled bruising and shredded muscle, and bits of dirt and debris clung to the open wound, likely from the impact. Blood was dripping steadily onto the stretcher, pooling in uneven streaks across the sterile white sheet beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sight made Agatha’s stomach tighten—not from queasiness, but from the urgency of the situation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” the attending physician called as she entered the room. He was mid-setup for a central line insertion, his face taut with concern. “This is Mary Connors, 32 weeks pregnant. Severe blunt trauma from a car accident. The fetal heart rate is dropping, and we’re losing maternal vitals fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved quickly to the bedside, assessing the woman’s condition in an instant. Her vitals were low, and there was a palpable sense of urgency in the room. She placed her hand on the woman’s abdomen, gently pressing. There was a slight shift in the fetal heartbeat monitor—a slow, irregular beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She snapped into action.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get an ultrasound, stat. We need to confirm fetal positioning and any signs of placental abruption,” Agatha ordered, her voice calm but authoritative. “Start two large-bore IVs, and prepare for a possible emergency C-section depending on what we find.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team responded immediately, the nurses already in motion, and the ultrasound technician rushed in with the portable machine. Agatha’s eyes remained on the monitor as she observed the fetal heart rate pattern. The baby’s distress was evident, and it was clear they were running out of time. But the mother’s instability added another layer of complexity to the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ultrasound revealed a significant placental abruption, with signs of hemorrhaging that threatened both the woman’s life and the baby’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prepare for immediate surgery,” Agatha commanded. “We’re going to need an emergency C-section. Both of them are in jeopardy. Let’s move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team worked to get the mother prepped for surgery, Agatha’s mind was already in overdrive, calculating the risks. She needed to act fast, but with precision. There was no room for error when both lives were on the line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I understand the fetal distress, but we need to be careful here. This woman is in critical condition. Her BP is dropping rapidly. If we proceed with the C-section too quickly, we risk hemorrhaging her out before we even get to the baby. we need to stabilize the leg first” Agtatha stiffened. Of course they had called her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr Vidal approached the patient. She was already reviewing the medical chart in her hands, her brow furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. "We don’t have the luxury of time," she replied, her voice cool but firm. "This is a case of placental abruption, and the longer we wait, the more we risk both of them. The baby’s heart rate is already dropping. If we don’t act now, we could lose both mother and child."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal met Agatha’s gaze with a cool, measured look. There was no doubt in her eyes—she wasn’t backing down, but she wasn’t pushing further either. Agatha could feel the subtle challenge hanging between them. Vidal, the young rising star, already positioning herself as an equal in the room. But Agatha knew this was no time for professional posturing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The hemorrhaging from the leg injury is significant,” Vidal said, her voice low but steady. “If we don’t stabilize the leg first, she’ll bleed out before we get to the baby. You know that as well as I do, Dr. Harkness. We need to prioritize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a sharp breath, her mind working quickly. She wanted to trust her instincts—take the baby first, save the child before it was too late—but Vidal had a point. If they didn’t stem the blood loss from the leg, the mother might not survive long enough for the C-section.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers tightened into fists at her sides, but she didn’t hesitate. “You’re right. Stabilize the leg first, but we move fast. We don’t wait around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal nodded, a glint of something like respect—or maybe just a shared understanding—flashing across her face. "We’ll need a full blood transfusion set up as well. I'll call for it now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team shifted into action, Agatha kept a sharp eye on the monitors. There was no room for hesitation in a case like this, not with two lives at stake. While Dr  Vidal coordinated the stabilization of the woman’s leg, she kept one eye on the fetal heart rate. It was dangerously low, a rhythmic pattern that spoke of deep distress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes felt like hours. Vidal’s hands were steady, her expertise undeniable as she worked on the leg injury, but Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling of being caught in a race against time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prep the OR,” Agatha barked, her voice commanding. “We’re not wasting a second after this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team moved with precision, their movements synchronized under Agatha’s leadership. Vidal didn’t falter, though Agatha could sense the tension in the air. They were both calculating, both trying to find a way to save both mother and child. But Agatha’s mind stayed focused on the baby’s heart rate, dropping dangerously low by the second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re almost there,” Vidal said, her voice calm amidst the chaos. “Get the mother ready for transport, and we’ll move as soon as we have the leg stabilized.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a sharp nod, her gaze never leaving the monitor. “Get her to the OR. I’ll make the final call on the C-section.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The decision was made. In that moment, both of their expertise blended—Vidal’s precision with trauma and Agatha’s unwavering focus on neonatal care. They’d work together, for now, but Agatha knew that this was her room, her call. There was no room for compromise when lives were on the line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the patient was prepped and moved into the operating room, Agatha’s heart raced, but her hands were steady. This was what she did best—this was where she thrived. The trauma, the pressure, the stakes—it all came down to this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rushed into the changing room, tossing her clothes aside as she quickly donned the hospital scrubs. Then, she hurried to scrub into the OR. Dr. Vidal was already there, washing her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Agatha said sharply. “You already stabilized the leg on the trauma bay. I'll get someone to page you when i'm done with the c section”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal didn’t flinch. “I need to install the external fixators on her femur before you do that or she’ll bleed to death before you even get the chance to deliver the baby. Rushing into a C-section without stabilizing could cause more harm than good. We need to stabilize her first, get her blood pressure up, and manage the bleeding before making any decisions about the baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t take her eyes off her. “We’re beyond stabilization, Vidal. Every minute we delay, we lose precious time for that baby. I’m not about to sit here and wait for her to bleed out while we ‘stabilize.’ We do both, and we do it now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension between them was palpable, the room momentarily still as their differing opinions clashed. Agatha had seen what could happen when you hesitated in situations like this—she wasn’t going to let that happen today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed, her voice lowering but still sharp. “I’m not saying we wait forever. I’m saying we don’t throw caution to the wind and jeopardize the mother’s survival for the sake of a hasty decision. We need a controlled, careful approach.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step closer to her, her stance unwavering. “A controlled approach is a luxury we don’t have. The baby is already in distress. If we don’t deliver now, we’re playing a dangerous game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched, both surgeons unwilling to back down. For a brief moment, the team hovered, unsure whether to follow Agatha’s directive for immediate action or Rio’s cautious approach. But Agatha’s authority was undeniable, and she knew that if they didn’t follow her lead, they would all lose precious time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to the anesthesiologist, who had been waiting for directions. “Get the patient intubated, stat. We’re going in.” Her gaze flicked back to Dr. Vidal. “We’re doing this my way. I’ll take full responsibility for the outcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her for a long moment, her jaw clenched. Then, with a sharp nod, she stepped aside. “Fine,” she said, her tone still tense. “But you’re on the hook for this, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her eyes without hesitation. “I’m not stupid. I know the risks. But I’m not willing to lose a mother and child because we second-guess ourselves. I’ll deliver the baby, and then you’ll handle the leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With the final decision made, the tension in the room remained thick, but the team quickly rallied into action. Agatha didn’t have the time or the patience to question her choices now. She was focused—utterly committed to the task at hand. As the team prepared for surgery, she placed her hands on the woman’s abdomen, steadying herself for the high-stakes operation that would determine the lives of both mother and baby.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no room for error, no room for hesitation. And she was determined to make sure that, no matter the outcome, she wouldn’t back down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thoughts flickered briefly to Nicky. But there was no time to dwell on it. This was her job—her responsibility. She couldn’t afford distractions now. In the operating room, it would be all hands on deck, and Agatha had to ensure both the mother and child survived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go,” Agatha said, her voice sharp as she scrubbed in. The room went quiet except for the hum of machines and the soft shuffle of her team as they prepared for the delicate, high-stakes procedure. The pressure was immense, but Agatha was used to it. She thrived in these moments. And right now, every second counted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team moved quickly into action, each person seamlessly stepping into their role, the choreography of the OR honed by countless hours of training and instinct. The anesthesiologist focused on maintaining the patient’s fragile vitals, calling out updates while the surgical assistants worked efficiently to prepare for the emergency C-section. The atmosphere was thick with urgency, the hum of the monitors a constant reminder of how precarious the situation was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind was razor-sharp, her focus unyielding. She couldn’t afford a single misstep. Every second counted. The patient’s vitals were dropping—a precarious mix of tachycardia and plummeting blood pressure. Agatha’s gloved hands moved with practiced precision as she made the first incision, her scalpel cutting through layers of skin, subcutaneous fat, and fascia. The bleeding was heavier than expected, but she worked quickly, adjusting her technique to minimize further loss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Retractor,” Agatha barked, her voice steady despite the tension crackling in the air. The surgical assistant handed her the tool, and she positioned it with precision, exposing the uterine wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal stood just outside the sterile field, arms crossed, her eyes sharp and assessing. Agatha could feel the weight of her gaze but didn’t acknowledge it. This wasn’t the time for egos or friction. This was about the mother and the baby, and nothing else mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The baby’s heart rate flickered on the monitor—slow and erratic. Agatha felt her own heartbeat sync with the fragile rhythm. Her next incision was deliberate, cutting through the uterus and exposing the amniotic sac. A gush of fluid spilled out, and for a split second, time seemed to freeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Agatha muttered under her breath, her hands reaching into the uterus. She felt the baby’s small, fragile body—a startling contrast to the clinical intensity around her. She cradled the infant’s slippery form in her hands, lifting it out with practiced care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby’s out!” she called, her voice ringing with authority. The neonatal team was already at her side, and she handed the baby over, watching as they sprang into action. The room seemed to collectively hold its breath as the team worked to resuscitate the newborn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s focus snapped back to the mother. The uterine wall was bleeding profusely, and the patient’s blood pressure was dropping even further. “Suction,” she demanded, and the nurse responded immediately. She worked quickly to control the hemorrhage, applying pressure and suturing with relentless precision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal moved in as Agatha stabilized the uterus, ready to address the open fracture in the patient’s right leg. The bone was exposed, jagged and white against the bruised and swollen flesh. Vidal’s hands were steady as she prepared the external fixators. For the first time since their earlier clash, their movements aligned, their shared professionalism overriding any lingering tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vitals holding steady,” the anesthesiologist reported, her voice strained but steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha said, her eyes flicking over to Vidal, who was already applying the external fixators. The tension between them had simmered down to a cold professional respect, though neither one had forgotten the earlier standoff.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The neonatal team’s soft cheer broke through the tension. The baby had let out a faint, fragile cry—a sound that sent a ripple of relief through the room. Agatha didn’t let herself pause. There was still work to be done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s close her up,” she said firmly, her voice cutting through the quiet hum of the monitors. The surgical team moved in perfect harmony, each step calculated and efficient. Agatha worked quickly, suturing the final layers of tissue and ensuring no further bleeding threatened the patient’s stability.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team worked to finish the procedure, she took a moment to breathe, her muscles aching from the intensity of the surgery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the procedure was finally complete, Agatha stepped back, her hands trembling slightly as the adrenaline began to fade. The patient’s vitals were stabilizing, the baby was alive, and they had done everything they could. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled deeply, the tension slowly beginning to ease from her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team moved to prepare for the next steps, Agatha felt a strange mixture of exhaustion and satisfaction. The weight of the day was heavy, but in that moment, she knew she had done what was necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal looked up from her work, her expression unreadable but calm. “Good” she said, her tone devoid of its earlier edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded curtly, too exhausted to do more than acknowledge the sentiment. The tension between them hadn’t dissipated entirely, but for now, they had fought the same battle and won. As the team began to clean up and prepare for the transfer to the ICU, Agatha allowed herself one deep breath of relief. The hardest part was over—at least for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door to the OR swung open, and a nurse entered with an update. “The baby’s stable, Dr. Harkness. He’s in the NICU now, and the mother’s blood pressure is starting to stabilize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart gave a quiet leap. She didn’t allow herself to show it, but there was relief in her chest. The hardest part was over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha and Dr. Vidal exited the OR, the harsh fluorescent lights flickered above them, casting long shadows on the sterile hospital floor. The tension between them was suffocating, the air thick with unresolved anger. The surgery was over, but the battle for control had only just begun. Agatha could feel Vidal’s presence like a weight behind her, her every step a challenge. Agatha refused to turn around. She wasn’t in the mood to deal with this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smell of antiseptic still clung to Agatha’s senses as they walked down the corridor, the adrenaline of the OR slowly giving way to the weight of exhaustion. Her mind was already on the next steps in the case, but Vidal wasn’t going to let her focus shift just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell was that?” Vidal’s voice was a sharp, cutting whisper. Agatha stopped walking but didn’t turn to face her. She knew exactly what this was about. And she didn’t have the energy to entertain it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was what, Dr. Vidal?” Agatha’s voice came out flat, brittle from the pressure, but controlled. Just barely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal stood just behind her, arms crossed, her eyes seething with barely contained fury. “I understand your urgency in the OR, but we can’t just rush through these decisions. The mother’s still in critical condition, and you didn’t listen when I suggested stabilizing her leg first. If you’d waited—just for a few minutes—we could’ve avoided all that unnecessary risk. You don’t get to call the shots on your own here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spun on her heel, fury igniting in her chest. “You think I don’t know that?” she snapped, taking a step forward, her voice hardening like a blade. “Every second in that OR was a decision, and I chose the baby. I’m not going to let a child die while we sit around and waste time debating the best sequence of events. This was about life or death, not playing it safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s jaw clenched, her nostrils flaring as her anger bubbled to the surface. “You’re reckless. You acted out of desperation. That was a gamble, Dr Harkness—one you weren’t prepared for.” Her voice dropped, cold and cutting. “And I won’t let you pretend that your decision was some perfect, well-thought-out plan. You didn’t listen. You ignored my recommendation, and we both know it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hit Agatha like a slap, but she wasn’t about to let Vidal get the better of her. She took a step closer, her voice low and dangerous. “You weren’t the one who had to make that call. I didn’t ‘gamble,’ I made a choice—and I stand by it. If you want to throw stones, fine. But don’t mistake me for someone who second-guesses their decisions when lives are on the line.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, Vidal said nothing. The silence between them was tense, raw, and neither one seemed willing to back down. Agatha met Vidal’s glare, unflinching, her heart hammering but her resolve unwavering. Then, Vidal spoke again, her voice quieter, but still carrying an undeniable bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think you’re the only one who cares about saving lives? That you’re the only one who’s willing to do whatever it takes?” Vidal’s eyes darkened. “I didn’t sign up for this to be sidelined by someone too proud to listen to the people around them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened, and her chest tightened. She wasn’t going to let Vidal turn this into a personal attack. She bit back the urge to snap back and instead pressed her lips into a thin line. “This isn’t about pride, Vidal. This is about doing what needs to be done in the moment, not sitting on our hands because someone wants to play it safe. If you want to lecture me on caution, do it with someone who has time to entertain it. Today, there was no time. Not with that baby’s heart rate dropping. Not with that mother in the state she was in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t respond immediately. She inhaled deeply, a controlled breath, like she was steadying herself for something. The silence between them stretched taut, the weight of their words hanging in the air like smoke. Finally, Vidal spoke again, her voice quieter but no less hard-edged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said, her eyes flashing with something fierce. She stepped closer to Agatha, invading her personal space, and Agatha could feel the heat of Vidal’s body radiating toward her, unable to move. “You’ve got this one. But don’t get comfortable, Harkness. I won’t fall in line just because you gave yourself a higher rank today. I won’t let you dismiss me—or anyone else—just because you think you have all the answers. This is a team effort. And you’d better remember that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood her ground, every muscle in her body stiff with tension. She didn’t flinch. She wasn’t backing down. Not now. Not ever. “You think I don’t know what it means to be part of a team? I didn’t make that decision alone, Vidal. But I’m the one who called the shots. And I’ll continue to do what needs to be done—whether you like it or not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was cold, the air between them crackling with hostility, and for a split second, it seemed like they might go on fighting, endlessly, until someone gave in. But then, Agatha turned away, her shoulders tight, and started walking again, every step a silent refusal to engage further. The last thing she needed was to fight over every decision she made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked through the hospital, Agatha’s mind began shifting back to the case, back to the next steps. She had done what was necessary to save the mother and baby. Everything else—Vidal’s challenge, the power struggle—was irrelevant. The patient, the baby, her own decisions—that was all that mattered. Vidal could stew over her pride for all Agatha cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal was right about one thing: they would have to find a way to work together. But Agatha would always be the one making the tough calls. </span>
<em>
<span>Always.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>Agatha paced the dimly lit corridor outside the ICU, her footsteps echoing softly against the sterile tiles. The weight of the day pressed down on her, but it wasn’t the exhaustion in her muscles or the ache in her lower back that gnawed at her. It was the guilt—a creeping, insidious thing that clung to her chest and whispered doubts into her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did what needed to be done. That was what she told herself. That was what she </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to believe. But as the minutes went by, her confidence wavered. Had she truly made the right call? Would stabilizing the mother’s leg first have changed the outcome? Would it have spared the patient some of the trauma her body had endured?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped walking and leaned against the wall, pinching the bridge of her nose. She could still feel Vidal’s sharp words echoing in her ears, and could still see the accusation in her dark eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Reckless."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The word stung more than it should have. She had always prided herself on her composure, her ability to make the tough calls under pressure. But today, she had acted on instinct, and that instinct had saved a life. Two lives, she corrected herself. She had delivered the baby, stabilized the mother, and stopped the bleeding. That was what mattered. That </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to be enough.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But what if it wasn’t?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed herself off the wall and walked toward the nurses’ station. Her steps felt heavier now, each one weighed down by the what-ifs swirling in her mind. A tired nurse glanced up from the computer, her eyes sympathetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Dr. Harkness," the nurse said softly. "You should go home. It’s late, and we’ve got things under control here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. "I’m not leaving until we find someone from her family," she said, her voice hoarse from hours of use. "Any updates on that?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse sighed, glancing at the file. "Not yet. We’ve called the emergency contacts listed, but no one’s picked up. Social services is working on it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let me know the moment you hear anything," Agatha replied. She turned away before the nurse could protest further, heading for the small on-call room down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the room was dark and quiet, the faint hum of the overhead light a constant presence. Agatha sank onto the thin cot, her body folding forward as she rested her elbows on her knees. She stared at the floor, her mind replaying the surgery in relentless detail. Every incision, every suture, every decision she had made flashed through her mind like a film reel stuck on repeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The baby’s weak cry echoed in her memory, a sound that had momentarily pierced through her exhaustion and doubt. That cry had been a victory, a fragile reminder of why she had fought so hard. But the mother was still in critical condition, her body battered and fragile. The machines were doing most of the work to keep her alive, and Agatha knew the road ahead would be long and uncertain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed on the metal table beside the cot, pulling her from her thoughts. She picked it up and glanced at the screen: a message from the night-shift resident.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"No updates on the family yet. Patient stable for now. Neonatal team says the baby is improving."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, the tension in her chest loosening just a fraction. The baby was improving. That was something. She set the phone down and leaned back against the wall, closing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The guilt still lingered, heavy and persistent, but she pushed it aside. There was no room for it right now. She needed to be ready—for the mother, for the baby, for the inevitable questions that would come in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the clock, the numbers staring back at her like a cruel reminder of everything she was missing. It was 12:06 AM. She wasn’t even on call, but here she was anyways—still at the hospital, still tethered to this sterile world of beeping monitors and urgent decisions. Nicky was at home, likely asleep, and she wouldn’t see him until morning. Guilt wormed its way into her chest, a slow, insidious thing that tightened around her heart. Was Daniel right? Had she really let her work consume her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated this feeling—this gnawing sense of inadequacy. She was supposed to be a mother first, wasn’t she? But here she was, choosing to stay behind while her son slept alone, as if the world outside the OR could wait. But the truth was, it couldn’t. There was always another life to save, always another crisis, and she couldn’t be in two places at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she was too absorbed in the work, too focused on the lives that hung in the balance in these cold, clinical rooms. She was married to her job, and it felt like everything else—Nicky, her family, even herself—was a distant second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of going home felt impossible. She would do one last check—on the baby, on the mother—and then she’d leave. But even as she thought it, she knew it wasn’t that simple. Leaving meant leaving a part of herself behind, a part of the commitment that drove her to this profession in the first place. Her shift had ended hours ago, but duty didn’t let her off the hook so easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seven hours. That’s all she had before she had to be back at the hospital for rounds. Seven hours to sleep, to attempt some fleeting semblance of normalcy. But sleep felt like a distant luxury. The weight of the decisions made today, the lives hanging in the balance, would follow her home, haunting her even in the quiet moments of rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to leave. </span>
<em>
<span>She needed to leave</span>
</em>
<span>. But every fiber of her being, every instinct honed by years of hard-earned experience, told her that the work wasn’t done yet. With those thoughts on her mind she made her way into the NICU.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sterile smell of the neonatal unit hit Agatha the moment she walked in. The soft beeping of the monitors, the hum of the ventilator—everything in this room was designed to keep life alive, to hold it together when the world outside felt like it was falling apart. Agatha paused by the incubator where the tiny baby lay, a fragile, miraculous bundle of life surrounded by wires and tubes. The baby’s chest rose and fell with a steady rhythm, the heartbeat strong and sure now. Agatha reached out, her fingers brushing the glass, a silent gesture of connection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The neonate’s skin was still so thin, almost translucent in places, but the baby was breathing on its own now. It had made it through the worst, and for that, Agatha allowed herself a moment of relief. A small, weak cry from the infant sent a flutter through her chest—nothing like the gut-wrenching fear of its earlier distress, but a sign of life, of progress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pediatric team had done their job, and now all she could do was wait, just as they were. But for now, the baby was stable. And that was something to hold onto.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned and left the neonatal unit, her steps dragging as she made her way to the ICU. The mother was still critical, and Agatha’s mind could not let go of her—she had made the decision, fought for both lives, but now the weight of it all was heavier than ever. The mother’s chances were still uncertain. She wasn’t out of the woods, and there was no guarantee she’d make it through the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The ICU was quiet, except for the constant beep of monitors and the soft shuffle of nurses moving between beds. Agatha stood at the door to the woman's room for a long moment, taking in the sight of the pale, unconscious woman, the blood pressure cuff still inflated, the IV lines running into her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked to her side, pulling up the chair and sitting quietly next to the bed. She didn’t speak. There was nothing to say, really. Just the soft whoosh of the ventilator and the rhythmic beeping of the monitors filled the room, the air heavy with an unspoken tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes drifted to the woman’s pale face, the bruising on her abdomen and the signs of trauma visible even under the dim hospital lighting. Agatha had done what she could, but the feeling of powerlessness lingered. She reached out, lightly touching her hand, her fingers briefly closing around the limp fingers, as if holding on to some tiny shred of hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The exhaustion finally caught up with Agatha, her body heavy with the strain of the long hours. She leaned her head against the bed’s edge, her eyes closing just for a moment. But that moment stretched into something longer. The events of the day—of the surgery, of the choices made—blended together, the adrenaline fading into a dull ache in her bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even notice when sleep took over completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>----------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>The soft click of the door opening the next morning stirred her awake. Agatha blinked, disoriented for a moment as she straightened in her seat. Her neck ached, and she realized she must have dozed off sitting at the mother’s bedside. The hospital room was still quiet, but now there was another presence in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal stood in the doorway, her eyes flicking over to Agatha before moving to the woman in the bed. Vidal’s expression was unreadable, but there was something else there — something beyond professional concern. Agatha pushed herself up from the chair, feeling the weight of the night in her every movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, the remnants of sleep still clouding her vision. Her neck throbbed from the awkward position she had been in, but the dull ache was nothing compared to the heaviness in her chest. As the light from the hallway filtered into the room.</span>
<em>
<span> What time is it?</span>
</em>
<span> She had promised herself she’d leave before the next shift began, but here she was, still in the hospital, still tethered to this place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze flicked back to Vidal, who was standing in the doorway, looking as composed as ever. For a moment, Agatha felt exposed, as if Vidal could see all the cracks she was desperately trying to keep hidden beneath her professional exterior.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You stayed,” Vidal said, her voice low but surprisingly soft. It wasn’t an accusation. Just a statement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, the words she’d been rehearsing in her mind since the moment she’d sat down slipping away in the face of Vidal’s quiet question. She glanced back at the mother, still unconscious, but stable for now, before she answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed and stood, her legs unsteady beneath her. “What time is it?” she asked, her voice quieter now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Six-fifteen,” Vidal replied. “Have you been here all night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a pang of guilt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind reeled as the words sank in. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Six-fifteen AM.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The reality hit her like a ton of bricks. The hours had slipped away unnoticed, lost in the blur of the night’s chaos and the weight of decisions she hadn’t even fully processed. Six hours had passed since she decided to leave. And not once in that time had she thought of anything but the patient in the bed and the baby struggling to survive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Nicky…she hadn’t seen him. She hadn’t heard his voice, hadn’t put him to bed. The guilt settled deep in her stomach, a cold knot that wouldn’t loosen. </span>
<em>
<span>What kind of mother does that?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart clenched painfully as the realization sank deeper. Her son was probably waking up alone, only accompanied by his nanny. The thought of him in the morning light, confused and maybe even a little scared, gnawed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced herself to swallow the sharp taste of guilt, but it didn’t go away. She could feel the weight of Vidal’s gaze on her, though she tried her best to keep it together. </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t let her see you like this,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha thought desperately. </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t let her see how badly you’re failing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal was watching her with an unreadable expression, the same steady gaze she always wore. Yet Agatha could see the slightest flicker of understanding in her eyes. </span>
<em>
<span>She knows,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha thought, </span>
<em>
<span>she can see it in me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands trembled as she reached for the chair to steady herself. She had to leave. She had to get to Nicky. But the weight of the past hours—of everything she’d done, of everything she hadn’t done—was pressing down on her. And she felt like she was suffocating in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I... I need to go,” Agatha said, her voice strained. She turned away quickly, trying to hide the turmoil from Vidal, but she knew it was pointless. She wasn’t fooling anyone, least of all herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way toward the door, the exhaustion in her every step. But as she reached the threshold, she heard Vidal’s voice behind her, softer than before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll finish here,” Vidal said, her voice pulling Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head slightly to acknowledge Vidal, giving her a brief, silent thanks. She couldn’t bring herself to say it aloud, not when the weight of the night still pressed so heavily on her. But Vidal’s presence—steady, calm—had somehow made the situation a little easier to bear. Even if Agatha didn’t know how to forgive herself just yet, at least someone else believed she was doing her best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a final, deep breath, Agatha opened the door and stepped out into the hallway, the cool air of the early morning a stark contrast to the heat of the room she’d just left. Her footsteps were slow, each one heavy, but determined. Nicky needed her. And for the first time that night, Agatha allowed herself to believe she could still make it home to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—--------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s foot pressed harder on the accelerator as she sped down the quiet, empty streets. The rising sun had begun to paint the sky in shades of orange and pink, but she barely noticed. Her mind was fixed on one thing—getting home. She couldn’t afford to lose another precious moment with Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse quickened, but not from the adrenaline of driving recklessly. No, it was the thought of seeing her son’s face again, the reassurance she’d been missing all night. She couldn’t help the guilt that gnawed at her, but the thought of him still asleep, probably missing her warmth, gave her enough of a push to keep moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She parked her car in the driveway, barely giving herself a moment to breathe before slamming the door behind her and rushing inside. The familiar scent of the house—clean, slightly floral, and safe—did little to calm her nerves. The house was silent, but she knew he was here, somewhere. Her footsteps echoed as she moved quickly through the hall, passing his room where the door was slightly ajar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She peeked inside. There he was, still curled up under his covers, his soft breathing rising and falling in gentle rhythm. He was so small, so innocent, and the sight of him made the tight knot in her chest loosen, if only a little. She stood there for a moment, taking in the peaceful image, trying to let the moment of calm wash over her before reality set in again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned in and gently nudged him awake, her voice soft but insistent. “Nicky,” she whispered, brushing a lock of his hair from his face. “Time to wake up, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes fluttered open slowly, and a sleepy smile stretched across his face as he blinked up at her. “Mommy?” he mumbled, rubbing his eyes. “You’re home?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled, and for a moment, the weight of everything else disappeared. She reached down, smoothing his blankets and brushing his hair away from his forehead. “Yes, I’m home,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you went to sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“ I missed you." His arms stretched out toward her for a hug, and Agatha didn’t hesitate. He reached up for her, his small arms wrapping around her neck as she lifted him into her arms, holding him close. She kissed the top of his head, whispering sweet nothings, anything to make him feel like the most important thing in the world, because he was. In that moment, nothing else mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the clock was ticking. The time was slipping away, and she had already wasted too much of it. Agatha pulled herself together, setting Nicky back on his feet. “I have to take a quick shower, baby,” she said softly, smoothing his hair back once more. “You stay here and Karina will help you get dressed, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded, though he looked at her with his usual trusting, wide-eyed gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave him one last kiss on the forehead before hurrying to the bathroom to take a quick shower. Her mind raced as she stripped off her clothes, the warmth of the shower engulfing her for just a few moments. She had no time to relax, no time to let the hot water soak away the exhaustion of the night. It was quick and efficient—just enough to make her feel human again, just enough to refresh her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she stepped out, she glanced at the clock. Time was slipping by too fast. She had twenty minutes before she needed to be at the hospital for rounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rushed to get dressed, pulling on a pair of black slacks, a white blouse, and a purple  blazer. She didn’t have time to perfect her appearance, so she focused on the essentials: pulling her hair back in a ponytail, making sure her badge was clipped to her chest, and giving her face a quick swipe of makeup to mask the almost sleepless night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She found Nicky sitting on the couch, dressed in his favorite little outfit, his small shoes already on his feet, his face bright. He held up his stuffed bear and grinned. “Mommy, look! Teddy’s ready to go!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, a warm, genuine smile. “I see, Teddy’s ready to go. You’re ready to go, too, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded eagerly, standing up with a little bounce in his step. “I want to go to the park later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help the bittersweet smile that tugged at her lips. “I promise, baby. We’ll go to the park. But right now, Mommy has to go to work, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded solemnly but didn’t complain, and Agatha felt her heart squeeze in her chest. She wished she could stay with him longer, but the pull of duty was stronger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave him one last kiss on the cheek before grabbing her bag, throwing it over her shoulder, and heading for the door. “I’ll be back soon, I promise. You and Teddy take care of each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Mommy,” Nicky said with a grin, waving as she stepped out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused in the hallway, taking one last look at her little boy, standing there in the doorway, his tiny hand waving goodbye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that final thought, she turned and rushed out the door, already late for rounds, but her heart lightened knowing she’d seen her son before she stepped back into the chaos of the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s steps were brisk as she navigated the hospital hallways, her mind a mix of exhaustion and determination. She had only a few minutes to pull herself together before she had to face the residents and start rounds. She hated this part of the day—the endless back-and-forth of checking charts, correcting mistakes, and reviewing cases with doctors who were still learning the ropes. But it was part of the job, and she was good at it, too good sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she entered the round room, the residents immediately fell silent, as if they knew to brace for whatever was coming. Agatha’s eyes scanned the group, noting who was prepared and who was not. Dr. Larson, the third-year resident, was looking down at his shoes, clearly dreading her scrutiny. Dr. Patel was fiddling with a pen, avoiding eye contact. </span>
<em>
<span>Perfect.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha started, her voice low and controlled, though anyone who knew her could sense the tension simmering beneath the surface. “Let’s start with Mrs. Timmons, the trauma patient from last night. Who’s on her case?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Larson shifted uncomfortably, looking to Patel for some kind of rescue. Neither of them was quick to respond, but Agatha had already anticipated this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Larson?” she said, her tone sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He hesitated but finally spoke. “Uh, yes, Dr. Harkness. Mrs. Timmons is stable. We’ve managed the bleeding and fixed the fracture with external fixation. Her vitals have improved overnight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stable?” Agatha’s voice dropped a notch, as if the word itself left a sour taste in her mouth. “This is the woman who almost bled out on the table. Stable is not a word I use lightly. Did you adjust her fluids, increase the pressors? Did anyone check her for compartment syndrome after we stabilized her leg?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Larson's eyes widened, his face flushed as he started to stutter through the answer. “Uh, we... we made adjustments to her IV fluids, Dr. Harkness. But we didn’t check for compartment syndrome. Should we... should we do that now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, yes,” Agatha snapped, cutting him off. “She’s in critical condition, and you’re talking about </span>
<em>
<span>stable</span>
</em>
<span>? This isn’t a textbook case, Larson. She’s a living, breathing person, and she could deteriorate in an instant if you don’t stay ahead of the curve. Get your head in the game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other residents shifted uneasily, and Agatha could practically feel their collective anxiety. She didn’t care. They had to learn, and sometimes the lessons weren’t gentle. It wasn’t enough to just pass through medical school or residency. They had to think. They had to </span>
<em>
<span>anticipate</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to Dr. Patel next. “How are we doing with the baby? The newborn?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Patel cleared her throat and flipped through her notes. “The infant is stable, Dr. Harkness. The neonatologists managed to stabilize her respiratory function overnight. We’re monitoring for any complications, but as of now, she’s responding well to treatment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, but the weight of the baby’s fragile condition was never far from her mind. She had pulled the child out of the womb herself, and despite the team’s best efforts, the tiny form was always in a precarious state. She didn’t let her relief show, though. Not here. Not in front of the residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make sure the neonatologists keep a close eye on her,” Agatha continued, her voice lowering as she added a note of warning. “If there are any changes in the baby's status, I want to be informed immediately. This isn't over yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha’s eyes swept across the group, she saw a few more uncertain glances. The room felt too small, the air too thick. She hated the silence, and she could feel the tension seeping into her skin. They needed to learn how to be confident—how to think critically under pressure. That was what she had tried to instill in them since she’d started overseeing rounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, moving on,” Agatha said, her voice still carrying that sharp edge. “Who’s on Mrs. Timmons' pain management? Have we started her on a post-operative analgesia plan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Lee, the senior resident, spoke up. “We’ve started her on a PCA pump for now, Dr. Harkness. We’ve also set up a protocol for switching to oral pain management once she's more stable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, scanning Lee’s face. “Is that the most appropriate choice, given her blood pressure? I’d expect you to consider her comorbidities, the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and monitor accordingly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lee nodded quickly, taking notes. “Yes, Dr. Harkness. We’ll adjust the dose and monitor more closely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. And remember,” Agatha added, voice softening slightly, “it’s not about what’s easiest. It’s about what’s safest. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to the final case of the morning, running through the last few charts and providing a final assessment of each case. She was hard on the residents, but the truth was, she expected nothing less than perfection. She had no room for mistakes—especially not after the events of the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, the rounds ended, and Agatha stood by the door, her mind already racing to the day ahead of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stepped out of the ward, she was greeted by the familiar click of heels approaching her. Turning, she found Dr. Calderu, her sharp eyes and warm smile cutting through the haze of Agatha’s exhaustion. Calderu was impeccably dressed as always, her tailored blazer giving her an air of effortless authority.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Dr Calderu greeted, her tone friendly but with that ever-present undertone of expectation. “Just the person I wanted to see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha adjusted her grip on the clipboard, forcing herself to match Calderu’s smile. “Morning, Dr Calderu. Everything alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. And remember darling you can call me Lilia. Just wanted to check about tonight,” Calderu said, tilting her head slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight? Her mind started racing. What was happening tonight? </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then it hit her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dinner</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach sank. She had forgotten. Completely. Her schedule was already packed, and now she was supposed to attend a semi-formal dinner with her peers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hesitation must have shown on her face because Calderu’s smile shifted into something more knowing. “You forgot,” she said, not unkindly. “Don’t worry, it happens to all of us. It’s at eight, at Della Casa. You’ll be there, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded quickly, forcing a reassuring tone. “Of course I will be there. I already confirmed my attendance, remember? I Won't miss it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Calderu raised an eyebrow, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s face. “ We are looking forward to that. Everyone is really excited to get to know you” she paused for a second “ You look tired. You should grab some rest before then—or at least a strong coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a faint chuckle. “I’ll take that under advisement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Dr Calderu walked away, the weight of the evening ahead settled on Agatha’s shoulders. Another obligation, another role to play. She exhaled, mentally rearranging her day to fit it all in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she instinctively reached for it, hoping it wasn’t another emergency. Instead, it was a picture from Nicky’s nanny—a photo of him eating breakfast, his cheeks sticky with syrup and his bright eyes lighting up the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart twisted. She’d made it home to wake him up, but her time with him had been a blur. Now, as she stared at his face, she felt a pang of guilt that even the dinner with the department heads couldn’t match.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This afternoon, before dinner, she would make it up to him, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t optional. She had to—</span>
<em>
<span>she must.</span>
</em>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Before Agatha left the hospital, she took a detour back to the ICU to check on the mother and baby. She’d told herself she could trust the team to handle things, but her mind wouldn’t let it rest. The long corridors were quieter now, the buzz of the day winding down to a low hum.</p><p>She stepped into the mother’s room, her footsteps soft as though afraid to disturb the stillness. The woman lay as she had that morning—unconscious, pale, but stable. Machines beeped rhythmically, a reassuring sign that her body was holding on. Agatha scanned the monitors, her practiced eyes taking in the data in an instant. No major changes, no signs of deterioration.</p><p>Still no visitors, no family. The ache in Agatha’s chest deepened. How could someone endure so much alone? She stood there for a moment longer, her hand brushing the edge of the bed. The faint sound of the ventilator filled the silence, and Agatha silently promised herself she wouldn’t let this woman fade unnoticed. </p><p>She hesitated outside the NICU next. The baby—so tiny, so fragile—had been occupying a corner of her mind all day. The sight of those little fingers and translucent skin still haunted her, even in the flurry of rounds. Peering through the glass, she saw the incubator, surrounded by attentive nurses and the steady hum of monitors. She wanted to go in, to look closer, but she held herself back. The neonatologists were on it; she needed to trust them.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out and saw an email from Dr. Vidal.</p><p><b> <em>Subject:</em> </b> <em> Update on trauma patients </em> <em> <br/></em> <em> Both mother and baby are stable. No significant changes since morning. Neonatology will update if anything shifts. Get some rest, Dr Harkness. You’ve done enough today. </em></p><p>
<em> Dr Vidal </em>
</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her shoulders loosening slightly. Vidal’s brief message carried its usual calm precision, but Agatha sensed the unspoken care beneath it. She closed her phone and slipped it back into her pocket. She didn’t need to go looking for Vidal now. Her job was done—for today.</p><p>As she exited the hospital, her thoughts lingered on the ICU. The mother and baby were stable, but stability was fragile. Still, she’d done everything she could. For now, it would have to be enough.</p><p>By the time Agatha finally left the hospital, the winter sun hung low in the sky, painting the city in golden hues. Her steps quickened as she approached her car, her mind already shifting from the sterile, controlled chaos of the hospital to the warm, messy joy of home.</p><p>Nicky was already home waiting for her. She knew it from the picture the nanny had sent earlier: Nicky standing by the front window, his tiny hands pressed against the glass, watching for her. The thought brought a pang of guilt mixed with determination. She had promised herself she’d make time for him today, no matter what.</p><p>The drive home felt longer than usual, her fingers tapping against the steering wheel as she navigated through the slow crawl of evening traffic. When she finally pulled into the driveway, she saw Nicky’s small frame behind the curtains, the fabric shifting as he jumped up and down, waving excitedly.</p><p>The moment she stepped through the door, Nicky launched himself at her, his arms wrapping tightly around her legs. “Mommy!” he cried, his voice filled with delight.</p><p>Agatha dropped her bag and scooped him up, holding him close. “Hey, kiddo,” she said softly, pressing a kiss to his cheek. “Did you have a good day?”</p><p>“Uh-huh!” Nicky nodded enthusiastically. “Can we go to the park now? Please, Mommy? Please!”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock. Dinner with the department heads was looming, but there was still time—time for just the two of them. “Let’s do it,” she said, setting him down. “Go grab your shoes and coat. I’ll be ready in a second.”</p><p>Nicky darted off, and Agatha quickly swapped her heels for sneakers and grabbed a warmer jacket. Within minutes, they were out the door, Nicky skipping ahead as they made their way to the neighborhood park.</p><p>The park was alive with the sounds of children laughing, the rhythmic creak of swings, and the occasional bark of a dog. Nicky ran straight for the slide, his small legs pumping as he climbed to the top. Agatha settled onto a bench nearby, her eyes never leaving him as he waved at her from the platform.</p><p>“Watch me, Mommy!” he called before sliding down with a squeal of pure joy.</p><p>“I’m watching!” she called back, smiling despite the ache of exhaustion still lingering in her body. For the first time that day, the weight on her chest felt a little lighter.</p><p>As the minutes stretched into an hour, Agatha chased Nicky around the playground, helped him on the monkey bars, and laughed as he insisted on burying her shoes in the sandbox. She was fully present, her mind nowhere but here, with him.</p><p>By the time they headed home, the sky was streaked with the deep purples and oranges of dusk. Nicky’s hand was warm in hers, his steps slowing as the excitement of the day began to catch up with him.</p><p>“You’re the best, Mommy,” he said sleepily, leaning against her side.</p><p>Agatha squeezed his hand, her heart swelling. “And you’re my favorite little guy.”</p><p>The dinner still loomed ahead, but for now, this moment was hers and Nicky’s—simple, fleeting, and perfect.</p><p>Agatha returned home from the park with Nicky, her heart lighter from the sound of his laughter and the feel of his small hand in hers. He had insisted on showing her every flower, every leaf, and every bug he found, his excitement contagious. She had let herself be fully present in those moments, his joy washing away some of the day's heaviness.</p><p>Once inside, Nicky darted to the living room, babbling about his adventures to the nanny. Agatha smiled, but her mind had already shifted to the evening ahead. She kissed the top of Nicky's head, promising she’d read him a story before bed, and headed upstairs.</p><p>The bathroom filled with steam as Agatha stepped under the hot shower. She closed her eyes, letting the water cascade over her, washing away the sweat and strain of the day. The tension in her shoulders eased as she scrubbed away the remnants of the hospital—the smell of antiseptic, the fatigue clinging to her like a second skin.</p><p>After drying off, she stood before her closet, her hand brushing past casual blouses and trousers until she reached the dress she’d mentally reserved for evenings like this. It was a black dress, sleek and tailored, the fabric hugging her figure in all the right places without feeling overt. The neckline dipped just enough to hint at her collarbones, and the hemline ended modestly above the knee, balancing sophistication with allure. The subtle cinch at the waist highlighted her curves, but the design remained elegant, understated.</p><p>She slipped on the dress, smoothing the fabric over her hips, and glanced in the mirror. Her reflection looked polished, almost unrecognizable from the woman in scrubs from a few hours earlier.</p><p>From her jewelry box, she selected a pair of earrings—a stunning set of purple diamond drops that caught the light with every movement. As she fastened them, the cold metal brushing her skin, she felt a flicker of confidence return.</p><p>Agatha completed the look with her LV heels, the black leather sleek and glossy, their design minimal yet undeniably expensive. She stood a little taller as she stepped into them, the familiar click of the soles against the floor a reminder of the power she carried when she walked into a room.</p><p>A light spritz of perfume, subtle and warm, lingered in the air as she grabbed her clutch. Glancing one last time at her reflection, she allowed herself a small smile. The day had been long, but tonight she was ready to face the world again—polished, poised, and undeniably Agatha.</p><p>As Agatha descended the stairs, the click of her heels resonating softly against the hardwood, her thoughts churned. The prospect of this dinner sat uneasily in her stomach, an unwelcome obligation she couldn’t quite dodge. It wasn’t the event itself that bothered her—she’d attended countless formal dinners over the years. It was what this one symbolized.</p><p>The “family-style” dynamic Dr. Calderu had so enthusiastically described during her first day at Mayo Clinic made her skin crawl. The idea of a surgical team treating each other like siblings or cousins over shared plates and wine felt absurd to her. Surgery was discipline. It was precision. It was life and death. Not a casual dinner where people laughed too loudly and passed breadbaskets across the table.</p><p>Agatha knew she wasn’t built for that kind of camaraderie. She didn’t trust it. She didn’t like the blurred lines or the way it demanded a vulnerability she wasn’t willing to give. And she certainly didn’t want anyone pretending they knew her beyond her scalpel and her decisions in the OR.</p><p>She shifted her clutch to her other hand, her nails digging slightly into the leather as her irritation mounted. Maybe it was her fault for accepting Dr. Calderu’s invitation in the first place, but it had felt like there was no real option. It was her first time attending one of these dinners at her new position, and skipping it would send the wrong message. She didn’t want to be branded as standoffish—at least not more than she already was.</p><p>And yet, the whole thing left a bitter taste in her mouth.</p><p>Her mind darted to Dr. Vidal, the one person she dreaded and anticipated seeing tonight. Agatha hadn’t missed the glances Vidal had thrown her way earlier, nor the quiet tension that always seemed to linger between them. It was aggravating and oddly magnetic at the same time. Agatha didn’t know what irritated her more—the possibility that Vidal might pry into her life tonight under the guise of casual conversation, or that Vidal might pretend to care about this ridiculous “family dinner” as much as Calderu did.</p><p>Agatha's fingers tightened on the strap of her clutch as her thoughts drifted back to this morning, to the moment she had woken up in the hospital room and found Dr. Vidal standing in the doorway.</p><p>She hated being caught off guard, and Vidal had a way of doing just that—unearthing pieces of Agatha she preferred to keep buried. The memory of her steady gaze as she quietly took in the scene made Agatha’s skin prickle with discomfort. She’d spent the night slumped in a chair, vulnerable, exhausted, and painfully human. She hated that she had seen her like that, stripped of the armor she wore so carefully.</p><p>She hadn’t said much, but the weight of her presence had been enough. There had been no judgment in her voice when she said, <em> “You stayed.” </em> If anything, there had been something else—understanding? Respect? Agatha wasn’t sure, and that uncertainty gnawed at her. She didn’t want Vidal’s approval, and she certainly didn't need it. Yet the idea of what Vidal might think of her in that moment lingered, sharper than she cared to admit.</p><p>And then there was the fight in the OR.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched as she recalled the sharp words exchanged during the emergency surgery. Vidal had challenged her—publicly, decisively—and for a split second, Agatha had been furious. It wasn’t the challenge itself that had stung; she could handle pushback. It was the fact that Vidal had been right.</p><p>The baby’s case had been a precarious balancing act, and Agatha’s instincts had screamed at her to proceed cautiously. But Vidal had pushed, advocating for a bolder approach, one that teetered on the edge of recklessness but offered a better outcome if it worked. In the heat of the moment, Agatha had shut Vidal down, unwilling to take the risk.</p><p>Looking back, she could still feel the heat of Vidal’s glare through her surgical mask, and could hear the quiet steel in her voice as she argued her point. It had taken everything in Agatha not to snap, not to let the tension crack her focus.</p><p>And yet, as much as she hated to admit it, Vidal’s insistence had lingered in her mind long after the surgery ended. She couldn’t shake the nagging thought that maybe, just maybe, she had seen something Agatha hadn’t—or hadn’t wanted to see.</p><p>It infuriated her. Not because she thought Vidal was wrong, but because Vidal’s presence had a way of forcing Agatha to confront things she’d rather ignore: her exhaustion, her mistakes, her humanity.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, pushing the thoughts aside. She couldn’t afford to dwell on Vidal, not tonight. The last thing she needed was to waste energy speculating about Vidal’s intentions. </p><p>Agatha entered the living room, where Nicky was sitting on the couch, a bright smile spreading across his face when he saw her. He was playing with his toy cars, but his eyes immediately flicked up to meet hers. She paused for a moment, the tiredness still heavy on her shoulders, but the warmth of his gaze eased some of that weight.</p><p>“Mommy, you look so beautiful,” he said, his little voice filled with such genuine sweetness that it stopped Agatha in her tracks.</p><p>She blinked, taken aback by the simplicity of the compliment, her breath catching for a moment. She hadn’t expected it, not from a four-year-old with a toy car in his hand, his face still smeared with traces of lunch. Yet, in his innocent, untainted way, he had somehow cut through the tired facade she’d put on for the day.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corner of her lips, soft and sincere. She knelt down in front of him, brushing a few stray locks of hair out of his face.</p><p>“Thank you, baby,” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion. She knew he didn’t understand the depth of her exhaustion, or the layers of guilt and pressure that had been weighing on her. But in that moment, she didn’t need him to. The simple act of him noticing her—seeing her, even in her worn state—felt like a balm for all the parts of herself she had neglected.</p><p>Nicky beamed at her, his little hands reaching up to give her a quick hug. Agatha squeezed him tightly, the rush of love filling her chest like a quiet promise. This was the reminder she needed: this was why she did it all. For him.</p><p>She kissed the top of his head, pulling back to look at him with a tender smile, letting the moment linger, a rare, quiet treasure in the midst of the chaos of her life.</p><p>Agatha stood up slowly, feeling the familiar pang of guilt wash over her, even as Nicky's innocent smile lingered in her mind. She was about to leave again—duty called, and she had no choice but to answer. But there was a part of her that wished she could stay.</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked down at him. "Okay, sweetheart," she said, her voice soft but steady. "Mommy's gotta go back to work now. I’ll be back soon, I promise."</p><p>Nicky looked up at her with wide, trusting eyes, his small hands clutching his toy car tightly. “Be careful, Mommy,” he said, a little wrinkle of concern creasing his forehead.</p><p>Agatha's heart ached. She bent down to kiss him on the forehead again, her lips lingering a moment longer than usual. "I will, Nicky. I’ll be careful. And I’ll be home soon."</p><p>As she straightened up, she gave him one last smile, forcing herself to make it bright, despite the heaviness of her heart. She needed him to feel secure, even if she didn’t quite feel it herself.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered, a promise more than just words.</p><p>"I love you too, Mommy!" Nicky replied, his voice filled with the innocent certainty of a child who believed in the simplicity of love.</p><p>With one last lingering glance at her son, Agatha walked toward the door, each step heavier than the last. She grabbed her purse, adjusted her coat, and with a quick glance over her shoulder, she said, "I’ll see you in the morning, okay?"</p><p>Nicky waved enthusiastically from his spot on the couch. "Okay! Bye, Mommy!"</p><p>Agatha stepped out into the cold night, the door closing softly behind her. As the cool air hit her face, she drew a sharp breath. It was time to put on the mask again—time to leave her home life behind and return to the chaos of the hospital.</p><p>But somewhere in her heart, the warmth of Nicky’s love lingered, a small reminder of why she pushed herself so hard, even when everything else felt like too much.</p><p>Still, as she stepped into the foyer, she couldn’t suppress the tension building in her chest. It wasn’t just the dinner, she realized. It was what the dinner represented—a chipping away at the walls she had so carefully built. Walls she wasn’t ready to let down for anyone, least of all Dr Vidal.</p><p>Tonight, she’d go, make an appearance, and leave as soon as it was polite to do so. No bonding, no stories about herself. And if anyone tried to drag her into that nonsense, she’d have a polite excuse at the ready.</p><p>The Uber pulled up in front of the restaurant, its sleek exterior glinting under the soft golden glow of the ornate lanterns lining the entrance. Agatha stepped out carefully, the glossy patent leather of her Louis Vuitton heels hitting the cobblestone driveway with a sharp click. The air smelled faintly of jasmine and citrus, mingling with the scent of fresh rain on stone.</p><p>The restaurant was undoubtedly upscale, its grand double doors flanked by manicured hedges and a red velvet rope that seemed more ceremonial than functional. Inside, through the towering glass windows, Agatha could see dim lighting, chandeliers glistening like constellations, and waitstaff in crisp black-and-white uniforms moving with practiced elegance.</p><p>Agatha straightened her black dress, smoothing the fabric that hugged her curves just enough to highlight her form while remaining classically elegant. The weight of her diamond earrings grounded her momentarily as she adjusted the strap of her clutch and walked up the short flight of stairs, her confidence feigned but convincing.</p><p>As she stepped inside, the hum of conversation and the clinking of glassware hit her ears. A hostess greeted her with a warm smile and led her toward the private dining area. The room she was ushered into had an air of exclusivity—polished oak floors, a long table set with fine china, and plush chairs that suggested they’d been selected for hours of indulgent conversation.</p><p>Lilia Calderu was the first to greet her, rising from her seat near the head of the table. She was dressed in an emerald-green silk blouse that matched the confidence in her sharp smile. “Agatha! You made it,” Lilia said, her voice as smooth as the wine being poured into glasses around the table.</p><p>Agatha nodded politely, forcing a smile as her eyes scanned the room. Wanda was seated a few chairs down, her vivid red hair catching the candlelight. She raised a glass in a silent toast when their eyes met. But the rest of the faces were unfamiliar—a cluster of department heads and senior staff, each looking far too comfortable with one another, laughing and leaning into the warmth of shared camaraderie.</p><p>Agatha’s unease prickled under her skin. She had always hated gatherings like this. The casual intimacy felt forced, the laughter too loud, the sense of camaraderie so foreign it felt alien. Lilia had called it a “family-style” dinner, and now Agatha understood why. The entire scene was like an unsettling echo of a real family gathering—complete with inside jokes and stories that felt designed to highlight her as the outsider.</p><p>“Come, sit,” Lilia gestured to the chair beside her, pulling Agatha further into the group. Agatha obliged, sliding into the seat and crossing her legs in a way that she hoped read as poised rather than uncomfortable.</p><p>Someone—a broad-shouldered man whose name she didn’t catch—leaned over to ask her a question about a recent case, and the conversation turned to work. Agatha gave clipped, professional answers, offering nothing more than what was necessary. Her glass of wine sat untouched.</p><p>The group’s laughter rang out around her, warm and unrestrained. Agatha found herself tightening her grip on the arm of her chair. She hated this kind of vulnerability, this shared comfort that she had neither the time nor the inclination to cultivate. Her discomfort wasn’t from not knowing these people—it was from realizing she didn’t want to know them.</p><p>She thought of Nicky for a brief moment, his small voice saying she looked beautiful, and wished she was back home with him.</p><p>Wanda caught her eye from across the table, raising an eyebrow as if to say, <em> Surviving yet? </em> Agatha managed a faint smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. As much as she disliked this dynamic, she had no choice but to endure it. After all, in her line of work, perception mattered nearly as much as skill.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers traced the stem of her wineglass absently, her gaze drifting around the room. The noise of the group—a chorus of laughter and overlapping conversations—faded into the background as a strange realization settled in.</p><p>No signs of Vidal.</p><p>For the first time that evening, she felt a flicker of ease, like an invisible tension unwinding from her spine. Maybe Vidal wasn’t coming. That would mean one less judgmental gaze dissecting her every word, one less person who knew just how much she hated being here.</p><p>She exhaled softly and allowed herself to lean back slightly in her chair. The tightness in her chest loosened, and for a moment, she even thought she might be able to enjoy the evening—or at least endure it without gritting her teeth.</p><p>But then, as the seconds stretched on, her thoughts turned sharp again. <em> She should be here. </em> The absence that had initially calmed her now stirred something closer to anger. After all, hadn’t Vidal practically demanded perfection from everyone? Hadn’t she carved herself into Agatha’s life with a relentless, cutting precision? And yet, here she was missing in action, leaving Agatha to suffer through this performative dinner alone.</p><p>Her jaw tightened, the irritation bubbling just beneath her composed exterior. She sipped her wine, more forcefully than necessary, and tried to bury the simmering annoyance.</p><p>“Agatha,” Lilia’s voice broke through her thoughts, drawing her attention back to the table. Lilia had that smile on again—the one that felt just a little too knowing. “I’ve been meaning to ask… how are you settling in? New city, new hospital. That must be a big adjustment.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, her expression smoothing into polite neutrality. “It’s been... busy,” she said, her voice clipped but polite. “Plenty to keep me occupied.”</p><p>“Do you have family here? Or are you on your own?” Lilis intervened again</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders stiffened slightly, though she kept her expression neutral. “Just me and my son,” she replied smoothly, taking a measured sip of her wine. She hoped the brief answer would satisfy the question, but Lilia wasn’t done.</p><p>“Oh, you have a son!” Wanda chimed in, leaning forward with a warm smile. “How old is he?”</p><p>“Four,” Agatha replied, her tone polite but clipped. She didn’t want to delve into this, especially not here, in a room full of near-strangers.</p><p>“That’s such a sweet age,” Wanda continued, her tone almost too earnest. “It must be challenging, though, balancing work and raising a child. I know that. I have two of my own. Billy and Tommy, my set of twins. They are six and right now are a handful, not going to lie. My husband and I managed barely to be able to keep”</p><p>Agatha forced a tight smile. “It’s a challenge” she asked, hoping for a change of topic that didn't involve her sharing her personal life.</p><p>Lilia tilted her head, her eyes narrowing slightly as if searching for more. “What about his dad? Is he in the picture?”</p><p>The question hit like a sharp jab, and Agatha’s fingers tightened around the stem of her wine glass. She kept her voice steady, though a touch of frost crept in. “No. Just me.”</p><p>Lilia hesitated, as if gauging whether to press further, but Wanda jumped in before she could. “You must be so busy,” she said, her tone sympathetic. “A single mom and a surgeon—how do you do it? Do you ever have time for yourself?”</p><p>Agatha let out a low, humorless chuckle, shaking her head. “Time for myself? Not much of that these days.” She paused, then added dryly, “I suppose that’s why I ended up here tonight. It’s about as close to a break as I get.”</p><p>The table laughed lightly, and Agatha seized the opportunity to redirect the focus. “What about all of you? This whole ‘family dinner’ tradition of yours—it’s quite the dynamic. How long have you been doing this?”</p><p>Lilia and Wanda exchanged a glance, and the conversation shifted back to their camaraderie, leaving Agatha momentarily off the hook. But even as the spotlight moved, she could still feel the weight of their questions, lingering like an unwelcome shadow.</p><p>Agatha hated talking about herself—especially when it came to her personal life. Sharing even the smallest details about Nicky, about the life she had carved out for them, felt like giving up control. And control was something she had clung to desperately, especially after everything that had unraveled in her past.</p><p>When she answered questions about her son or her status as a single mother, it was like cracking open a door she kept firmly bolted. She didn’t want their sympathy, their curiosity, or their judgments. They didn’t need to know how she balanced midnight surgeries with kindergarten pickups, or how she’d rebuilt her life after Daniel’s betrayal. Those were her struggles, her victories—hers to carry alone.</p><p>Here, at this table, surrounded by a dynamic she couldn’t relate to, Agatha felt the weight of their attention pressing down on her. Every question chipped away at her carefully maintained façade, and she hated it. The vulnerability of exposing even a sliver of her private world made her skin crawl. It was as if she was losing control of the narrative, allowing others to fill in the blanks with their assumptions.</p><p>And yet, refusing to answer outright wasn’t an option either. It would make her stand out even more, make her seem cold or aloof—traits that already followed her like shadows. So she played along, giving just enough to satisfy their curiosity but not enough to truly reveal anything of substance.</p><p>Still, every word felt like a betrayal of the boundary she had drawn between herself and the rest of the world. Agatha wasn’t just protecting herself by keeping her life private; she was protecting Nicky, their routine, their fragile sanctuary. This wasn’t the kind of vulnerability she was willing to indulge—not here, not with these people.</p><p>And yet, as the conversation moved on, she felt the tension simmering beneath her polished exterior. Sharing these details, however small, felt like a loss. A crack in the armor. And Agatha hated feeling anything less than entirely in control.</p><p>The sharp clatter of a fork against a glass broke through Agatha’s spiraling thoughts, yanking her back to the present. The hum of conversation at the table faltered, and Agatha instinctively glanced toward the entrance. Her heart gave a small, involuntary jolt.</p><p>It wasn’t something that interrupted her thoughts. It was someone.</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal.</em>
</p><p>She strode into the room with effortless confidence, drawing every pair of eyes like a magnet. The restaurant’s golden lights seemed to catch every angle of her perfectly tailored green suit. The deep emerald fabric was rich, almost luminous, and it clung to her frame in a way that was both sharp and undeniably sensual. The jacket was cut just low enough to hint at the curves beneath, her collarbone a delicate line above the subtle dip of the neckline. Her trousers skimmed her long legs, the kind of fit that spoke of custom tailoring and impeccable taste.</p><p>Her dark hair was pulled back just enough to highlight her striking features—high cheekbones, a jawline that could cut glass, and that damned smile. It wasn’t even a full smile, just a faint curve at the corners of her mouth, but it was enough to unnerve Agatha.</p><p>The air seemed to shift as Rio entered, as though she brought her own gravity. Even Lilia, who had been holding court at the head of the table with her usual boisterous charm, faltered for a moment, raising a hand in a half-wave.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away. She hated herself for it, but there was no denying Rio’s presence. She was arresting. Like a storm rolling in— unpredictable, and impossible to ignore.</p><p>For a fleeting moment, Agatha thought she saw Rio’s gaze sweep the room and land on her. That faint curve of her mouth deepened just slightly.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened on her wine glass. Any sense of ease she’d felt moments ago was gone, replaced by a roiling mixture of emotions she couldn’t quite name.</p><p>
<em> Damn her. </em>

<p>
<span>Rio stepped into the room with the ease of someone who knew exactly how to make an impression, while the faintest smirk tugged at her lips as she surveyed the table. She exuded an effortless magnetism, the kind that could command attention without a single word. Agatha hated that it worked so well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apologies for being late,” Rio said, her voice smooth and unhurried as if she weren’t the last one to arrive. “Something came up last minute—” her voice was calm but carrying just enough weight to silence the murmurs. She smiled, her teeth white against the dark red of her lips. It wasn’t an excuse; it was a brush-off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu looked up from her seat at the head of the table, her brow furrowing slightly. “Everything alright, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, nothing dramatic,” Rio replied with a casual wave of her hand, sidestepping any real explanation. “Handled and forgotten.” she said dismissively, clearly uninterested in elaborating. “All good now. Let’s not waste time on me.” She offered a warm smile that somehow felt more like a shield than an invitation. The tension that her tardiness might have created dissolved quickly, her charm disarming everyone as effortlessly as she entered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>” Now, where should I sit?” Agatha’s heart sank as she scanned the table. Every seat was filled. She was just beginning to hope Rio might be shuffled to another table entirely by herself when Calderu spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, we seem to have run out of chairs,” Calderu said, almost amused. “Someone, grab another for Dr. Vidal. She can join us here.” She gestured to the space next to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The waitstaff moved quickly, bringing in a spare chair and sliding it into the narrow gap beside her. Agatha tensed, her posture stiff as Rio strolled over, her eyes gleaming with something far too close to mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move, her face carefully blank as Rio slid into the chair beside her, close enough that their shoulders almost brushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like I’ll be your neighbor for the evening,” Rio said as she lowered herself into the chair, the scent of her cologne—a mix of cedar and something citrusy—brushing over Agatha’s senses. She sat closer than necessary, the arm of her chair just grazing Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a tight smile, her fingers gripping the stem of her wineglass a little too tightly. “Lucky me,” she muttered under her breath, low enough that only Rio could hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t sound so thrilled,” Rio whispered back, her tone teasing. “We’re supposed to be fostering camaraderie, aren’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her gaze toward the table, gripping her wineglass like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. “I didn’t realize camaraderie involved invading personal space.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in slightly, her voice dipping conspiratorially. “You didn’t seem like the type to mind a little invasion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened, a reaction she couldn’t fully control. She took a slow sip of her wine, willing herself to remain calm. “You’re late,” she said flatly, her tone carrying a subtle edge. “Didn’t think punctuality was a skill surgeons were allowed to neglect. Or did you miss that memo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fashionably late,” Rio corrected with a smirk. “It’s an art. Besides, it’s not like I missed anything earth-shattering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just your chance to make a good impression,” Agatha shot back, her voice sharper now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her dark eyes scanning Agatha’s face. “I think I’ve already made one. Whether it’s good or bad, well... I’ll let you decide.” She chuckled softly, leaning just slightly closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. “I make up for it in other ways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heat prickled at the back of Agatha’s neck, and she couldn’t tell if it was anger or something more insidious that made her skin flush. She hated the way Rio spoke—as though every word was a double-edged sword, cutting just enough to leave a mark. She hated the ease with which Rio had inserted herself into the room, the way everyone seemed instantly charmed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look tense,” Rio continued, her gaze flicking to Agatha’s rigid posture. “Big night for you I guess?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop talking,” Agatha hissed, her tone sharp enough to cut. But instead of retreating, Rio smirked and leaned back in her chair, slowly lifting an eyebrow, thoroughly entertained by Agatha’s barely concealed annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation around the table carried on, oblivious to the undercurrent between them. Agatha kept her eyes forward, trying to focus on Calderu’s anecdotes about department milestones and upcoming surgeries. But every time she shifted in her chair, she was acutely aware of Rio beside her—the warmth of her presence, the occasional brush of their sleeves. It was maddening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice dress, by the way,” Rio said suddenly, her voice soft but deliberate. “Black suits you. Very... commanding. Executionary style, like a modern-day Darth Vader.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the hell?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes snapped to Rio, but her expression gave nothing away except the faintest trace of amusement. “Shouldn’t you be catching up on the department gossip instead of commenting on my wardrobe?” she retorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m multitasking,” Rio replied with a shrug, her smirk deepening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, her expression hard and unreadable. She didn’t respond, though her pulse betrayed her annoyance—or was it something else? She couldn’t quite decide, and the ambiguity of it all only made her more frustrated. She hated how easily Rio got under her skin, how the teasing somehow managed to feel personal and impersonal all at once. It was like a game Rio had mastered, and Agatha despised being the unwitting participant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tightened her grip on her glass, silently vowing to endure the rest of the evening with as much dignity as she could muster. But when Rio leaned in again, her voice low enough to feel intimate, Agatha knew it was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet you rehearsed that in the mirror before you left,” Rio teased, her voice dropping just enough to ensure only Agatha could hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grip tightened on her glass, her knuckles whitening as she forced herself to take a slow sip. “Do you always have to talk this much?” she muttered through clenched teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only when I’m entertained,” Rio shot back, her grin widening. “And right now? You’re the highlight of my night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, her jaw tense. She tightened her grip on her glass, silently vowing to endure the rest of the evening with as much dignity as she could muster. She directed her focus toward Calderu, who was recounting a particularly dramatic case, but the words barely registered. Every time Agatha adjusted her position, she was acutely aware of Rio beside her—the warmth of her presence, the occasional brush of fabric against her arm. It was maddening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when Rio leaned in again, her voice low enough to feel intimate, Agatha knew it was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re no fun when you’re wound this tight,” Rio murmured, her breath brushing lightly against Agatha’s ear. “Relax. The world isn’t watching.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, the kind that would have made anyone else retreat. But Rio’s lips twitched into another infuriating smile, and she didn’t push further. Instead, she simply raised her glass in an unspoken truce, leaving Agatha to stew in her complicated tangle of irritation, intrigue, and the smallest flicker of something she refused to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moments stretched on, and despite her best efforts, Agatha’s mind remained fixed on Rio. The teasing, the casual proximity, the way Rio seemed to draw everyone’s attention without even trying—it was maddening. She hated how easily Rio slipped under her skin, how every word felt like a challenge, every glance like an unanswered question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the evening wore on, Calderu called for a toast, pulling Agatha’s attention back to the group. She raised her glass mechanically, the sound of clinking crystal filling the air. But even then, she could feel Rio’s presence beside her, as constant and vexing as ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Rio leaned in one last time, her voice soft but insistent, it sent a ripple of frustration—and something else—through Agatha. “Relax,” Rio said, her tone unusually sincere. “You’re among colleagues, not enemies. No one’s going to bite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, her expression as cold as she could manage. “Pity. I could’ve used the distraction.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laugh was quiet, but it carried just enough weight to send Agatha’s pulse into overdrive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, lounging back in her chair with the ease of someone who had thoroughly enjoyed herself, turned to the group.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what’s everyone doing after this?” she asked, her voice casual but her eyes sharp, scanning the faces at the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Heading home,” Dr. Calderu said firmly, dabbing at her lips with her napkin. “It’s late, and I have an early morning tomorrow.” Several others murmured similar sentiments, the rigors of surgical life evident in their tired faces.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not me,” Wanda declared, a sly grin creeping onto her lips. “Mariah and I are hitting a bar downtown. Someplace with good music and even better whiskey.” She leaned forward slightly, her gaze landing on Agatha. “You should come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, caught off guard by the sudden attention. “I don’t think so,” she started, her voice hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on,” Wanda pressed, her grin widening. “You’re new here. You need to loosen up, get a feel for the city’s nightlife. Besides, I won’t take no for an answer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah Hill, sitting a few seats away, nodded in agreement. “It’ll be fun. And it’s not every night we get a break like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her grip tightening around her glass. The idea of spending more time with anyone tonight felt exhausting, but at the same time, there was something freeing about stepping into the unfamiliar. She had nothing to lose, really. Still, she wasn’t ready to commit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Agatha said cautiously. “I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should go,” Rio interjected, cutting her off with a teasing lilt in her voice. “You might actually enjoy yourself for once. It’s been a while since you’ve done something that’s not, oh, I don’t know—terribly important.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, but Rio’s smirk only deepened. She leaned in slightly, her voice low and playful, though loud enough for the others to hear. “Unless you’re worried you can’t keep up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? Can’t keep up?” Wanda cut in, her tone dripping with mock disbelief. “Impossible. She’s clearly got ‘party animal’ written all over her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laughter rippled through the table, and Agatha felt heat rise to her cheeks, though she managed to maintain her usual composed expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t need advice from you,” Agatha snapped under her breath, her voice a low warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m not advising,” Rio replied, leaning back with an infuriating air of nonchalance. “I’m just saying—life’s short. Might as well make a night of it. Besides, I’m curious how you’d handle something that’s, you know, actually fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda chuckled, clearly enjoying the exchange. “You’re right, Rio. Agatha, don’t tell me you’re all work and no play?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened, her mind bristling with irritation. Rio’s ability to needle her was almost an art form.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you coming with us then, Rio?” Wanda asked, her tone light but her curiosity evident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not tonight,” Rio said with a dismissive wave of her hand. “But you should absolutely drag Agatha along.” Her grin turned wicked as she added, “She could use a little fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah smirked, raising an eyebrow at Agatha. “No offense, but you don’t exactly strike me as a whiskey-and-music type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I can surprise you,” Agatha replied coolly, the sharpness in her tone earning a chuckle from Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s full of surprises,” Rio added, her teasing relentless. “Though I bet she orders something boring, like a vodka soda, and nurses it all night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes, her frustration bubbling just beneath the surface. But as she sat there, surrounded by the chatter and the warmth of the room, a part of her softened. Maybe Wanda was right. Maybe she did need to loosen up, to embrace the unknown instead of retreating into herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Agatha said finally, her voice firmer than she felt. She set her glass down with a decisive clink. “I’ll go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda beamed, and Mariah raised her glass in approval. “That’s the spirit,” Wanda said, leaning back with satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low whistle, her grin smug. “Guess I underestimated you. Maybe tonight’s the night you finally surprise me, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze with a cold stare, refusing to let her irritation show further. She avoided looking at Rio after that, but she could feel her eyes lingering—a weight that seemed to both irritate and intrigue her in equal measure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the group began to disperse, Agatha stood, smoothing her dress and steeling herself for whatever came next. She didn’t know if this was a mistake, but for tonight, she was willing to take the risk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While they gathered their belongings and began to drift toward the exit, Rio lingered near Agatha, her green suit sharp under the soft lighting of the restaurant. Agatha tried to keep her focus on her clutch, on her phone, on anything but the woman who had spent the evening alternately charming and infuriating her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enjoy your night,” Rio said casually, her voice like silk, as she adjusted her cufflink. Her smirk was just a touch too knowing, her tone just a shade too amused. “Try not to overthink it, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “Goodbye, Dr. Vidal,” she said curtly, her tone clipped. She didn’t look back, but she could feel Rio’s eyes on her as she followed Wanda and Mariah out to the street. What was she doing?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, a part of her couldn’t shake the lingering question: </span>
<em>
<span>Why wasn’t Rio coming with them?</span>
</em>
<span> The question surfaced unbidden, accompanied by an unexpected pang of disappointment. Rio’s playful teasing had been a thorn in her side all evening, but somehow, it had anchored her too. Her absence now felt oddly unmooring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated herself for caring. What did it matter why Rio wasn’t going? Agatha had made it perfectly clear she didn’t need—or want—Rio’s input on her choices. But the thought nagged at her, persistent as an itch she couldn’t scratch. Maybe it was the ambiguity of Rio’s reasons, the casual way she’d brushed off the invitation. Or maybe it was something deeper, something about Rio’s infuriating ability to rattle her composure and then retreat as if she were above it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed softly under her breath, trying to shake off the irritation. This was supposed to be her night, her choice. Yet, the thought of Rio’s absence lingered like a shadow, affecting her in ways she refused to examine too closely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the cool night air hit her skin, Agatha refocused on Wanda and Mariah, who were chatting easily beside her. She climbed into the backseat of the Uber, settling into the leather upholstery with a mix of apprehension and resolve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to understand why Rio wasn’t there or why it bothered her. She just had to move forward. For tonight, at least, she’d let herself step outside the confines of her carefully constructed world. Whatever came next, she’d face it head-on—without Rio Vidal’s infuriating smirk lingering in the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Uber pulled up to the curb, and Wanda immediately slid into the middle seat, waving Agatha to follow. “Come on, Agatha” Wanda teased, patting the seat next to her. “This is going to be fun. Or at least funny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and climbed in, settling into the seat as Mariah took the other side. The car was filled with a faint smell of leather and citrus air freshener. Wanda, ever the extrovert, immediately began chatting with the driver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, the cool leather pressing against her bare shoulders. She could feel the tension from the evening beginning to dissipate, but her mind still churned. What possessed her to agree to this? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda seemed to sense her unease. “Lighten up, Agatha,” she said, her tone conspiratorial. “We’re not going to make you sing karaoke or anything.” She paused, then grinned. “Unless you want to. In which case, Mariah’s buying the first round.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah groaned but smiled. “Don’t listen to her. She’s been trying to get me to do karaoke for years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the faint smile that tugged at her lips. Wanda’s energy was infectious, her jokes a welcome distraction from her own spiraling thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Uber hit a bump, and Wanda exaggeratedly clutched at Agatha’s arm. “See? Already an adventure,” she said with mock drama. “I can tell this night is going to be legendary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have an interesting definition of legendary,” Agatha said dryly, but her voice had softened, her tone less sharp. For the first time that evening, she felt the faintest flicker of anticipation. Maybe this wouldn’t be such a disaster after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the car turned down the glowing streets of downtown, Agatha glanced out the window, the city lights blurring past. She wasn’t sure what she was chasing tonight—escape, connection, or just a moment to forget. But for now, she let herself be carried along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Uber came to a smooth stop outside a sleek, dimly lit bar with large glass windows. The place exuded a perfect balance of elegance and casual chic, its polished wood and soft golden lighting inviting but not overwhelming. The crowd inside was a mix of well-dressed patrons, but the atmosphere was warm, not pretentious. A jazz band played softly in the corner, blending into the hum of conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here we are,” Wanda said, stepping out of the car first. She was already grinning, clearly in her element. “Time to relax.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed, trying to shake off the last remnants of tension from the dinner. She had been hyper-aware of every conversation, every glance, but now she was starting to feel like she could breathe again. The cool night air helped clear her head as they walked through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the bar was lively, but not overcrowded. The host greeted them with a smile, and after a quick word, they were escorted to a private booth in the back. It was an intimate space, with plush seating that curved around a small, elegant table, a candle flickering gently in the middle. A large window behind them provided a view of the city streets, and the ambient lighting was low but comforting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda slid into the booth first, making herself at home. Mariah followed, settling in beside her. Agatha hesitated for a moment before sitting, finally sinking into the softness of the seat. She could feel her shoulders drop just a little bit, her body beginning to relax now that the pressure of the evening had shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A waiter arrived almost immediately with a small tray of drinks and a menu, his presence smooth and efficient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to start with something simple to welcome Agatha,” Wanda declared with a grin, “A round of cocktails for the newbie.” She glanced at the waiter. “We’ll have three Negronis, please. Make it a double.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The waiter nodded, taking the order and leaving them to chat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms loosely on the table, feeling a little out of place but also surprisingly comfortable. It was strange—she’d spent so many years in hospitals and offices, in environments that demanded precision and control. But here, in this relaxed, almost luxurious setting, she found herself trying to navigate the lines between professionalism and something far more... casual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Agatha,” Wanda started, her eyes sparkling with curiosity, “tell us about yourself. Do you have a partner? A dog, maybe? What's your kid's name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned forward, her expression warm but equally inquisitive. “Yeah, we’re all dying to know more. You’ve been pretty quiet all night, and we need some answers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicked between the two women. She hadn’t expected this—didn’t know what to expect, really. But the questions felt invasive, like they were peeling back layers she wasn’t ready to expose. Her stomach clenched slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“His name is Nicholas, no husband,” Agatha said smoothly, keeping her tone even. “And as for pets...” She paused, eyes flicking to the side before she added, “Not at the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence that followed felt too thick. It wasn’t a bad silence, just... pregnant with unasked questions. Agatha shifted uncomfortably, feeling the weight of the scrutiny on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Really? No pets? You seem like a cat person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered a tight smile, deflecting. “I used to have a dog. He didn’t quite work out.” Her voice was casual, though the memory tugged at her in ways she couldn’t quite control. Her eyes darted to the window, watching the city bustle outside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah laughed softly, leaning back. “So, what </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> you do when you’re not being a surgeon?” she asked, her voice more relaxed now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered the question, eyes narrowing slightly. How much of herself did she really want to give them? This dinner, this conversation, was supposed to be a break—an escape from the weight of work, of responsibility. But it was hard to leave behind the parts of her that felt too exposed, too vulnerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was about to elude the question, the waiter returned with their drinks, setting them down on the table with a practiced flourish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here you go—Negronis for everyone,” he said with a polite smile, before retreating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda picked up her glass, toasting it gently in the air. “To Agatha,” she said, a twinkle in her eye. “Welcome to the team. May the rest of your evening be as eventful as our first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clinked her glass against theirs, the cold surface of the glass steadying her hands as she took a sip. The bitter-sweetness of the Negroni filled her senses, and for a moment, the weight of the conversation, of the questions, seemed to lift. The night was just beginning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a moment, swirling her Negroni thoughtfully, then decided to turn the tables. She needed something to focus on other than her own discomfort, and who better to interrogate than the two women who had been so relentlessly curious about her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Maria,” Agatha started, her voice smooth, “you’re the pediatric surgery chief, right? That’s impressive.” She leaned back slightly, trying to keep her tone casual. “How do you manage such a high-stress job? Must be hard to keep everything balanced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria chuckled, taking a sip of her drink. "Oh, it's not easy, that's for sure. You can’t really ‘balance’ anything. It’s a constant juggling act. But it’s rewarding, especially when you get to save kids.” She smiled softly, a proud glint in her eyes. “And yes, I’m single so that helps a lot. Got a cat though—his name is Alfred.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A cat?” Agatha asked, raising an eyebrow. “What’s that like? A little companionship?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria smirked. “He’s great. A bit of a diva, but he’s the only living thing in my apartment that doesn’t ask for anything from me. No constant demands, no needy behaviors—just the occasional cuddle when he wants to nap.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, who had been quiet for a moment, suddenly piped up with a teasing grin. “I think that’s the perfect relationship. No emotional baggage to carry around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, the banter easing the tension in her chest a little. She then turned her attention to Wanda, who was sipping her drink casually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you, Wanda?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned broadly, the question clearly one she enjoyed answering. “I've got my twins and I live with my partner. His name is Vision. He’s my fiancé.” She paused, her eyes glinting with humor. “He’s actually a stay-at-home dad right now. It’s an arrangement that works for us. Someone’s got to raise the little one while I’m out here saving lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise. “Wait, he’s a stay-at-home dad? That’s... interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t get me started,” Maria chimed in, her tone playful. “We like to mock Wanda for this dynamic. But hey, it works for them, so whatever.” She gave Wanda a pointed look. “Right, Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugged, clearly unbothered. “Yeah, it works. Vision is great with the kids. He’s got his hands full, but I’m killing it in the OR, so it’s all good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched into a smile. “Well, that’s a new take on things. When it's the big  day happening?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually I really don't know. We got engaged in my second year as an attending and a month after we found out that we were pregnant with the twins. We postponed it because of work and the kids so I'm not sure but it's definitely happening. It works for us right now. We've been together for 15 years so waiting a little more doesn't bother us” she paused</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you?” Wanda asked with a sly grin, taking another sip. “Why are you single? I mean, you’re successful, you have your life together. Most people would have settled down by now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, not expecting the question to come so directly. The tone in Wanda’s voice was casual, but it hit a nerve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I—" Agatha started, pausing to think. "I’ve just never felt like I had the time for that sort of thing. Between work and... everything else, it wasn’t really a priority for me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned in a bit, narrowing her eyes playfully. “You’re saying that like you've never had anyone in your life. You’re telling me a woman like you—smart, driven, with the whole world at her feet—has never had someone to settle down with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flickered to the side for a moment. She didn’t want to get into specifics, not here, not now. But the thought of the past—of Daniel—slipped into her mind, uninvited. She felt the weight of that old pain start to creep in, but she swallowed it down quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath, her fingers tightening around her glass as Wanda’s question hung in the air. She hadn’t been asked about her personal life in a while, and the thought of opening up, even just a little, felt strange. But she realized they weren’t going to let it go, and she didn’t really care to keep pretending anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was married,” she said, her voice even, but there was a slight hesitation before the words left her mouth. “But not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t elaborate, didn’t explain the details of the messy divorce, or the heartbreak, or Daniel. That part of her life was long behind her. But the weight of those words hung between them, a quiet, unspoken history.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria gave her a nod, sensing the unspoken depth behind the response, but Wanda’s expression softened with curiosity. “I’m sorry to hear that,” she said gently, though her eyes were still inquisitive. “Do you think you’ll ever... try again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, her face carefully neutral. “I don’t know. It’s not really something I’ve thought about much. Right now, I’m focused on my kid and on my work, on what I do best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria nodded, seeming to understand that there was more to the story, but Agatha’s calmness in the face of the question was enough to convince her not to press further. Wanda, on the other hand, wasn’t as easily deterred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” Wanda said, giving her a playful grin, clearly trying to lighten the mood. “No pressure. But hey, I can’t help but think you’d make someone very happy. You seem like the kind of woman who knows what she wants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, the words hitting their mark just right, but she didn’t let herself get drawn in. Instead, she took a sip of her drink, letting the conversation move in another direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria, sensing the shift, leaned back and smiled. “It’s interesting, though, how so many people think that success in one area of life should translate into success in every other area. Like... if you’re good at your job, you should automatically be good at everything else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small, tight smile. “It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? The expectation that we all have to fit into this perfect mold.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s gaze softened slightly, a knowing look in her eyes. “I get it. It’s not always as easy as people think it is.” She took a deep breath, then looked at Agatha seriously. “But hey, don’t let anyone rush you. You do you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at both women, feeling the warmth of their understanding. There was a certain comfort in knowing that they didn’t expect her to fit into their mold. She could relax a little, let her guard down just a fraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria looked up from her drink, glancing at Wanda with a raised brow. "Speaking of, why wasn't Rio here tonight? She’s usually around, especially for something like this."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, ever the conversationalist, leaned back in her chair, her lips curling into a smile. Agatha shifted slightly in her seat, intrigued despite herself. She hadn’t realized she was still so... aware of Rio’s absence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think Rio had some prior engagement," Wanda said casually, a playful glint in her eyes as she toyed with her drink. "Something about needing 'alone time,' which, you know what that means. Rio being Rio," Wanda replied with a wink, her voice carrying a hint of finality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah nodded, accepting the explanation without further question. Agatha, however, couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story. She felt a slight flush creep up her neck. She wasn’t sure why, but the thought of Rio deliberately avoiding this gathering struck a nerve. She hated how much it bothered her, but there it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to use this as an opportunity to know more about Rio, that </span>
<em>
<span>fucking infuriating person</span>
</em>
<span>. She had spent the better part of the evening being teased and goaded by her, only for Rio to vanish and leave her in this unfamiliar crowd. It was maddening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was it about Rio that made her so impossible to ignore? Agatha had been trying to dismiss her since the moment they met, but it was as though Rio left behind an invisible tether, one that yanked at her when she least expected it. And now, sitting here, listening to Wanda’s lighthearted dismissal, Agatha’s curiosity burned brighter than her irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She really keeps people guessing, doesn’t she?" Agatha said, her voice deliberately neutral, though she could feel the weight of her own interest betraying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned her gaze to Agatha, her expression mischievous. “Oh, absolutely. Rio’s like that stray cat you leave milk out for. She’ll come and go as she pleases, and just when you think she’s gone for good, there she is—stealing your seat and charming your guests.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The analogy hit uncomfortably close to home, and Agatha forced a tight smile. She could picture it all too vividly: Rio strolling into any room as though she owned it, leaving chaos in her wake and never staying long enough to answer for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, some of us prefer a little more consistency,” Agatha said dryly, lifting her glass to take a measured sip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah chuckled softly, but Wanda’s grin only deepened. “Consistency’s boring,” Wanda quipped. “And Rio’s never boring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, choosing instead to let the conversation move on. But as Mariah and Wanda began discussing their plans for the week, Agatha’s thoughts lingered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated how Rio had taken up so much space in her mind without even being there. She hated how much she wanted to unravel the mystery of her absence, as though knowing more about Rio would somehow settle the uneasy pull she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But most of all, she hated the nagging realization that she didn’t just want to understand Rio. She wanted Rio to understand her—and that was the most infuriating thought of all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the evening wore on, Agatha found herself glancing toward the door occasionally, half-expecting Rio to walk in. But she never did. She left a subtle void in the group, a space that Agatha couldn't help but feel drawn to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her glass. It wasn’t just about Rio’s absence—it was the unspoken things left unsaid. Why was Rio so unpredictable? Why did she pull away when Agatha least expected it? And why, despite her frustration, was Agatha so fixated on it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The evening wound down. As much as Agatha tried to deflect, there were still lingering questions she had skillfully avoided, and she’d managed to keep her personal life just vague enough to leave them unsatisfied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good night, Agatha," Mariah said, squeezing her shoulder gently before moving toward the door. "It was great to finally meet you. You should join us more often. We try to go out at least once every two weeks. It's mostly us and Rio. Other people tag along sometimes. You definitely should"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was already halfway out the door, waving back with a mischievous smile. "We’ll hold you to that, Agatha!</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the last of them left, Agatha lingered by the bar for a few more minutes, her thoughts unsettled. She waited for her Uber to arrive, the minutes stretching longer than they should have. Finally, the familiar ping of her ride app let her know it was outside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she stepped out into the cool night air, the question that had been sitting heavily in her chest all evening resurfaced with renewed intensity: </span>
<em>
<span>Why did Rio being Rio mean that?</span>
</em>
<span> What exactly was it about Rio’s unpredictable nature that kept her at the forefront of Agatha's mind? Agatha couldn’t put it into words, but it felt like there was a deeper layer to Rio’s behavior that Agatha couldn’t quite unravel. It was frustrating, maddening, and yet… still somehow magnetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Uber ride back to her apartment was quiet, the rhythmic hum of the tires on asphalt offering little solace. Agatha rested her head against the window, watching the city lights flicker by. She had tried not to let the evening get under her skin, to simply be a participant, not an observer of the dynamics between everyone else, but there it was, the unshakeable feeling that she was a piece in a puzzle she wasn’t sure she wanted to be a part of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally arrived home, the apartment felt strangely empty. Nicky’s toys were scattered across the living room, a familiar chaos that reminded her of the bright little whirlwind who’d return in the morning. She was grateful for the quiet, though. Tonight had been more draining than she’d expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kicking off her shoes, she made her way to the bathroom, craving the soothing embrace of a hot shower. Steam soon filled the small space, and she stepped under the scalding water, hoping it would wash away the remnants of the night’s lingering tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hadn’t been a terrible idea to go out with Wanda and Mariah, she admitted to herself. She’d actually enjoyed the easy camaraderie and the lively atmosphere of the bar. It had been refreshing, a small break from the isolating cocoon she often wrapped around herself. And, surprisingly, she’d managed to hold her own without giving away too much about her personal life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, it would have been better if she hadn’t revealed anything at all. Agatha grimaced, the thought needling at her as she rinsed off. She was usually so careful, so deliberate in keeping her walls up. Tonight, though, those walls had felt just a little thinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stepping out of the shower, she dried off quickly, her thoughts still swirling. She glanced at her phone, the screen lighting up to reveal a familiar blank slate. No new messages. Awesome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she flicked off the bathroom light and padded to her bedroom. The sheets were cool against her skin as she slid into bed, her mind racing even as exhaustion began to catch up with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had enjoyed herself—more than she expected. But that nagging unease refused to let go. The evening had felt like a tightrope walk, balancing between connection and guardedness, between feeling seen and staying hidden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her last thought before sleep took her was of Rio. Not her teasing smile or her green suit, but the maddening ambiguity of her absence—and the unshakable pull she still had on Agatha’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned off the lights and climbed into bed, her mind racing as the exhaustion from the day finally started to catch up with her. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha groaned as a persistent tug on her arm pulled her from the depths of sleep. The room was too bright, the air too cold, and her head throbbed like a drum being struck in rhythm. She squinted against the sunlight streaming through the window, the shape of her son gradually coming into focus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom! Wake up! Pancakes!!” Nicky’s voice was loud and insistent, his small hands shaking her shoulder with the determination only a child could muster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned again, this time in protest, her brain struggling to catch up. “Nicky, it’s... what time is it?” Her voice was hoarse, her throat dry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s pancake time!” he declared triumphantly, as if that was an actual time on the clock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pancake time,” she repeated, her voice flat. She pushed herself up on one elbow, immediately regretting it as the motion sent a wave of nausea through her. “Nicky, honey, can we—just this once—skip pancakes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes widened, horrified. “No!” he exclaimed, crossing his arms in defiance. “It’s Pancake Saturday. Dad always used to make pancakes for us, remember?.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced, partly from the pounding in her head and partly from the unintended guilt in his words. Pancake Saturday had always been their tradition—Daniel’s tradition, really. Agatha had never been the pancake expert, not even close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right, all right,” she muttered, rubbing her temples. “Pancakes. But I make no promises about the quality. You might end up eating a pancake-shaped brick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed, climbing off the bed with an excited bounce. “You can’t mess up pancakes, Mom. You just put them in the pan and flip them!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Spoken like someone who’s never cooked a day in his life,” she grumbled, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. The floor felt colder than she expected, and her joints protested as she stood. A glance in the mirror revealed a disheveled, tired woman with dark circles under her eyes and hair resembling an unkempt bird’s nest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give me five minutes,” she said, waving Nicky toward the door. “Go get your pancake-eating face ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran off, his laughter echoing down the hallway, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts and her pounding head. She sighed deeply, bracing herself on the dresser.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never again,” she muttered, her voice hoarse but firm. “Never drinking again... or at least not before fucking pancake day .”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled on a robe and shuffled toward the kitchen, where the daunting task of recreating a tradition she hadn’t mastered loomed. The smell of syrup and the sound of Nicky singing a pancake song he’d made up filled the air as she reached for the mixing bowl. It wasn’t going to be pretty, but she’d make it work—somehow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the pancake batter, her skepticism growing with every slow stir of the whisk. It was too lumpy. Or maybe it wasn’t lumpy enough? She couldn’t tell. Cooking wasn’t her thing. Cutting people open? Sure. Flipping pancakes? Not so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, perched on a stool beside her, watched with wide eyes and an air of barely contained impatience. “Mom, are you sure you know how to make pancakes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Define ‘know,’” Agatha muttered, eyeing the batter suspiciously. She flicked on the stove and poured a dollop into the pan, the batter spreading unevenly like a badly planned crime scene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky leaned closer, squinting at the sizzling mess. “It’s not supposed to look like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you a pancake expert now?” Agatha shot back, grabbing a spatula and poking at the blob. “Because if you are, feel free to take over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He giggled, but his giggles turned to gasps when she attempted to flip the pancake. Instead of a graceful arc, it flopped halfway, folding over itself like a deflated balloon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom! You made a taco!” Nicky exclaimed, laughing so hard he nearly fell off the stool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the sad excuse for a pancake and sighed. “It’s a... pancake innovation. A taco-cake. Trendy chefs would kill for this idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, Mom,” Nicky said between giggles. “Just make sure the next one isn’t so... um, floppy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted,” she said dryly, scooping the pancake-taco onto a plate and pouring another dollop of batter into the pan. This time, it spread more evenly, and she felt a tiny flicker of hope. Deciding to change the subject, she turned to him with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, future birthday boy. What do you want to do for your birthday this year?” It was still two weeks away, but she needed to start planning now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s laughter faded, and he sat up straighter, his little face suddenly serious. “I want Dad to come,” he said quietly, looking at her with those big, earnest eyes that always made her heart twist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, the spatula hovering mid-air. She forced a smile, though it felt like a tightrope act. “We’ll see, sweetheart,” she said gently, turning back to the pan. “Anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky seemed to think for a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then his face lit up. “I want Auntie Nat to come, too!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “Nat? Auntie Nat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky grinned. “She’s the coolest. She tells funny stories and knows all the cool moves.” He jumped off the stool and struck what she assumed was a karate pose, complete with exaggerated sound effects.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, even as a pang of nostalgia hit her. Nat, her best friend from college, hadn’t been around much since... well, since everything. But Nicky adored her, and the thought of Nat being there for his birthday didn’t feel as impossible as the other request.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll call Auntie Nat,” Agatha said, flipping the pancake—successfully this time—and sliding it onto a plate. “But I’m not making any promises about Dad, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Nicky said, accepting the plate and immediately drowning the pancake in syrup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she watched him dig in, her heart ached just a little. Nicky’s wishes were simple, but fulfilling them? That was another story entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Nicky as he happily drowned his pancake in an absurd amount of syrup. The sight was both endearing and mildly horrifying, but it gave her a moment to think—or at least try to think past the slight throb of her hangover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Daniel. It had been months since she’d spoken to him directly—without lawyers acting as intermediaries. The divorce had been a war zone of accusations, negotiations, and compromises neither of them truly wanted to make. Split custody was the only thing they agreed on, but even that was a logistical headache. Nicky will spend all his vacations with his dad and the rest of the year with Agatha in Minnesota. The thought of broaching the subject of a birthday gathering made her stomach twist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She absently flipped another pancake onto a plate, the golden-brown surface a rare victory in her culinary experiment. “Nicky, honey,” she said, her voice soft. “You know your dad is going to see you during your break from preschool in a few weeks. Are you sure you want him to come here for your birthday too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked up, his face a mix of syrup and sincerity. “Yeah, Mom. Birthdays are special, right? I want everyone to be here. You, Dad, and Auntie Nat. All my favorite people.” he said with a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, brushing a strand of damp hair from her face. “I know, sweetie. I’ll try, okay? But I really can’t make any promises about your dad. You know how grown-up things can be... tricky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded solemnly, his little face more understanding than she felt he should be at his age. “Okay, but Auntie Nat has to come!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small smile tugged at her lips. If there was one person who could distract Nicky from the complexities of grown-up life, it was Natasha Romanoff.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat was a force of nature—a neurosurgeon with the sharpest wit and a heart of gold buried under a layer of sarcasm. They had met on the first day of pre-med, bonding over a shared disdain for the professor’s outdated PowerPoint slides. From then on, they were inseparable, navigating med school, the many sleepless nights, and life’s endless curveballs together. By some stroke of luck, they’d even matched into the same hospital for residency, cementing their status as each other’s ride-or-die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite their demanding schedules and living in different cities—Nat still firmly rooted in New York while Agatha had fled to the quiet coast like a drama queen in exile—one thing had always been true: Nat was there for her. Through breakups, career meltdowns, bad haircuts, existential crises, and now, the chaotic aftermath of Agatha's divorce, Nat was her constant. And Agatha, well… had gone completely MIA since she quit her job at NYU two months ago, making her harder to pin down than a sock in the dryer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’ll come,” Agatha said confidently, despite the tiny flicker of guilt gnawing at the back of her mind. Nat was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> going to be pissed when she got the call—assuming Agatha didn’t chicken out and text instead. Honestly, texting felt safer. Nat’s rant over the phone would be epic. </span>
<em>
<span>"Are you kidding me, Agatha? Have you lost your damn mind? I swear to God—"</span>
</em>
<span> Yeah, better to just text. Maybe throw in a cute emoji for good measure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Auntie Nat wouldn’t miss your big day for the world,” Agatha reassured her son with a smile, trying to sound convincing while silently preparing herself for Nat’s inevitable wrath. There would be cursing. A lot of cursing. Nat was probably going to call her every name under the sun, maybe even invent a few new ones. And she’d deserve it. But hey, Nat always showed up in the end, even if it was with a dramatic sigh and a fresh set of insults. It was just part of her charm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned, clearly satisfied, and returned to his pancake massacre.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, meanwhile, leaned against the counter, her coffee now lukewarm but somehow more palatable than the thought of calling Daniel. How would that even go? Could they manage a civil conversation about their son’s birthday without dredging up all the baggage that still hung between them?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The idea of talking to him directly felt like navigating a minefield, but she couldn’t deny Nicky this small, hopeful request. She’d figure it out. She always did—somehow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom,” Nicky said around a mouthful of syrup-soaked pancake. “Can I have a blue cake this year? Like, really blue. Like the ocean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled despite herself, ruffling his messy hair. “A blue cake, huh? Consider it done. Just don’t ask me to bake it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky giggled, and for a moment, the weight of everything else faded into the background. Whatever hurdles lay ahead—whether they involved ex-husbands or brightly colored cakes—she’d face them. Because if there was one thing she knew how to do, it was survive. And this? This was just another challenge to overcome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day unfolded at a blessedly slow pace, a rarity in Agatha’s usually chaotic life. After breakfast, Nicky insisted on building an elaborate blanket fort in the living room. Agatha joined him, her hangover steadily easing as she laughed at his enthusiastic “engineering.” They spent hours stacking cushions and draping sheets, transforming the space into a fortress worthy of a fairytale. Once the masterpiece was complete, Nicky promptly declared it his “headquarters” and crawled inside with his favorite book and a flashlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took the opportunity to curl up on the couch with her laptop, making a half-hearted attempt at outlining her next research. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, but her mind wandered. The simplicity of the day was soothing, a balm to her frayed nerves. She let herself enjoy the quiet moments—the sound of Nicky’s muffled giggles, the golden afternoon light spilling through the windows, the faint hum of the coffee maker in the background.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had a late lunch of grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup, Nicky dunking his sandwich with unrestrained enthusiasm. Afterward, they played a board game that quickly devolved into chaos when Nicky decided the rules were “too boring” and made up his own. Agatha let him win, his triumphant cheer making it worth her feigned frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time evening rolled around, the blanket fort had become a cozy movie theater. Nicky picked Finding Nemo, and they huddled together under a pile of blankets, munching on popcorn as the characters danced across the screen. Agatha found herself dozing off halfway through, her body finally succumbing to the much-needed rest she hadn’t allowed herself in weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the credits rolled, Nicky yawned dramatically and declared it was bedtime. Agatha helped him brush his teeth and tucked him in, kissing his forehead as he mumbled about blue cakes and Auntie Nat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was settling into her own bed with a book, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen to see Wanda’s name flashing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha answered, leaning back against her pillows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey yourself,” Wanda’s voice came through, bright and cheerful despite the late hour. “sorry for the time but i wanted to ask you something</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead” she said calmly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Vision and I are taking the twins to Disney on Ice on Monday, and we thought you and Nicky might want to join us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, surprised. “Disney on Ice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s supposed to be amazing. The twins are obsessed, and I figured Nicky might enjoy it too. Besides, we could all use a little fun, right?” Wanda’s tone was inviting, but there was a knowing edge to it, as if she’d already guessed Agatha’s initial reluctance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Monday?” Agatha hedged, mentally running through her schedule. “I’ve got a shift on Sunday, and so do you. Won’t we both be dead on our feet by then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably,” Wanda admitted with a laugh. “But that’s what coffee is for. Come on, Agatha. It’ll be good for Nicky—and for you. Plus, you’ll get to see Vision trying to wrangle two sugar-high six-year-olds while singing along to </span>
<em>
<span>Let It Go.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the mental image. “I’ll think about it,” she said finally, her tone noncommittal but not dismissive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better,” Wanda teased. “Let me know so I can get the tickets”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “I’ll let you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They said their goodbyes, and Agatha set her phone down, staring at the ceiling. Disney on Ice wasn’t exactly her scene, but the thought of spending time with Nicky was tempting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes, letting the quiet of the night envelop her. Maybe, she thought, Monday wouldn’t be so bad after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sunday morning came too soon, the shrill beeping of Agatha’s alarm cutting through the stillness of her bedroom. She groaned, dragging herself out of bed and into the bathroom. As the hot water from the shower pounded against her skin, she allowed herself a few minutes to wake up fully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dressed in her signature purple scrubs, her ID badge clipped to the neckline, Agatha tied her hair back into a neat ponytail and grabbed a protein bar from the kitchen. She checked on Nicky, still peacefully asleep in his bed, before double-checking the note she’d left for his babysitter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She arrived at the hospital with time to spare, the quiet of the early morning a sharp contrast to the chaos she knew would soon erupt. The air outside was crisp, the city just starting to stir. As Agatha swiped her badge at the entrance, her phone buzzed in her pocket.</span>
</p><p><b>Wanda:</b> <em><span>Coffee before shift? Meet me at the café in ten?</span></em></p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her steps quickening. She found Wanda at a small table near the café window, already sipping a latte and scrolling through her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Agatha greeted, dropping into the seat across from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Wanda replied, her smile bright despite the early hour. She pushed a second cup across the table. “I figured you’d need this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you” Agatha said, taking the cup and inhaling the rich aroma.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They chatted briefly about their weekends, Wanda recounting a comical story about her twins’ attempt at “helping” Vision make homemade pasta. Agatha shared a sanitized version of her lazy Saturday with Nicky, omitting the more emotionally charged moments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well rockstar ” Wanda said, glancing at her watch. “Are you ready to deliver some babies?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Let’s hope it’s not too crazy today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But by mid-morning, it was clear that hope had been futile. The labor and delivery floor was a madhouse. One after another, expectant mothers arrived, their contractions timed perfectly—or so it seemed—to create a non-stop stream of activity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to catch her breath between cases. A first-time mom needed extra reassurance; a veteran with her fourth child delivered so quickly they nearly missed it; and a high-risk patient required careful monitoring and a sudden rush to the operating room for an emergency C-section.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crossed paths with Wanda several times in the bustling hallways, both of them too busy to do more than exchange quick nods or the occasional grimace of shared exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By early evening, Agatha was leaning against the nurse’s station, sipping a lukewarm cup of water when Wanda approached, her hair slightly disheveled but her expression triumphant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Five deliveries and counting” Wanda said, collapsing onto the chair beside her. “And it’s not even the full moon. I don't know how you managed ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, her shoulders slumping as the adrenaline of the day started to wear off. “I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve washed my hands today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I stopped counting after twenty,” Wanda replied, then glanced at her phone. “Still thinking about tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “I haven’t decided yet. Ask me again after I’ve slept for fourteen hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Wanda said with a laugh, standing to head back to her next patient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the shift wore on, Agatha found herself falling into the familiar rhythm of the chaos. It was exhausting, yes, but also oddly grounding. By the time the last baby of her shift was born—a healthy little girl with a surprisingly strong set of lungs—Agatha felt a sense of accomplishment that almost made the aching in her feet worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the clock finally signaled the end of her shift, Agatha peeled off her gloves and sighed, glancing at the nearby window where the sky had long since gone dark. It had been a long day. And as she headed toward the locker room to change, she couldn’t help but think that maybe tomorrow, a little bit of magic—Disney on Ice and all—wouldn’t be such a bad idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she dragged herself into the locker room at the end of the shift, she found Wanda already there, sitting on the bench and unlacing her shoes with a huff. Her usually composed expression was gone, replaced by an exhausted grimace that screamed </span>
<em>
<span>What a day.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha said, collapsing onto the bench across from her. She started pulling off her own sneakers, her feet throbbing in protest. “Rough one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda let out a sharp, bitter laugh, tossing her boots aside with more force than necessary. “Rough doesn’t begin to cover it,” she muttered, leaning forward to rest her elbows on her knees. “Two motorcycle accidents within an hour of each other. One DOA, the other coded twice in the OR. Oh, and a stabbing because some genius decided to argue about parking spaces. </span>
<em>
<span>Parking spaces</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha. People are insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, pausing mid-motion as she peeled off her socks. “Sounds like a delightful day in trauma land.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Delightful doesn’t even cover it,” Wanda deadpanned, rubbing her temples. “And you know what the cherry on top was? The guy who brought in his friend who got stabbed—he thought it was a good time to flirt with me. Flirt! While I was literally trying to clamp an artery right next to him”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help it—she laughed, the absurdity of it cutting through her exhaustion. “Well, at least someone appreciates your charm, Maximoff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda rolled her eyes but allowed herself a small, wry smile. “Yeah, great. Next time I’m elbow-deep in someone’s arm, I’ll remember that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in companionable silence for a moment, the buzz of the fluorescent lights above them the only sound. Agatha could feel the weight of the day pressing down on her shoulders, but it was oddly comforting to share the space with someone who understood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you still thinking about Disney on Ice tomorrow?” Wanda asked, breaking the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, her head hitting the cool metal of the lockers. “I don’t know. I mean, Nicky would love it, but I’ve got to figure out how to survive the thought of spending my day off surrounded by screaming kids.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted. “Please, you’re a seasoned mom. You can handle it. Besides, my twins are the loudest of the bunch, and they’re basically pros at this sort of thing. You won’t even have to do anything. Just sit there and pretend you’re having fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head to look at her. “You’re really selling it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just saying, it might be nice to do something </span>
<em>
<span>normal</span>
</em>
<span> for once,” Wanda said, her tone softening. “I know today was insane, but tomorrow doesn’t have to be. Plus, it’ll make Nicky happy, and that’s worth a few hours of icy theatrics, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, closing her eyes briefly. “Yeah, you’re probably right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m always right,” Wanda quipped, standing and stretching. “Now go home and get some sleep, Agatha. You look like you’ve been run over by a truck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Agatha said dryly, but she smiled as she finished changing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they left the locker room together, Wanda paused, nudging Agatha with her elbow. “By the way, next time you complain about delivering a dozen babies in a day, remember this: at least none of them tried to flirt with you while you were doing it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound echoing in the quiet corridor. “Fair point, Maximoff. Fair point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before going into the parking lot Agatha made her way down the quiet hallway to the NICU. She wasn’t technically on duty anymore, but the events from a few days ago still weighed on her mind. The baby—the one who had survived that horrific car accident—was occupying more space in her thoughts than she cared to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused outside the viewing window, glancing in at the rows of tiny, fragile lives tucked into incubators. When she spotted the baby in question, her heart gave a strange, involuntary tug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurses had done a stellar job keeping her updated. The baby was stable for now, but the road ahead was uncertain. Prematurity compounded by trauma wasn’t an easy hurdle to overcome. Still, Agatha found herself oddly hopeful. Maybe it was because the baby had already beaten impossible odds by surviving the crash, or maybe it was because she needed something to root for after everything else this week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She entered the NICU, sanitizing her hands and greeting the nurse stationed nearby. “How’s our little fighter doing?” she asked, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse smiled faintly. “Holding steady. We managed to reduce the ventilator settings a bit earlier today. Small steps, but good ones.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha approached the incubator, peering down at the tiny baby swaddled in blankets, tubes and wires surrounding its fragile body. The sight was heartbreaking, but she forced herself to focus on the positives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a stubborn one, aren’t you?” she murmured, her voice so low it was almost a whisper. “Keep fighting, little one. You’ve got a world waiting for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few minutes, she left the NICU and took the elevator up to the ICU. Her steps slowed as she approached the room where the baby’s mother lay. The woman was still in a coma, her vitals stable but unchanging. Agatha stood in the doorway for a moment, hesitating before stepping inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was eerily quiet, save for the steady beep of the monitors and the soft whoosh of the ventilator. Agatha’s hands found her pockets as she took a seat by the bedside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got a little fighter down in the NICU,” she said softly, her eyes on the woman’s still form. “They’re hanging in there. I thought you should know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no response, of course. The machines continued their rhythmic work, indifferent to Agatha’s words. She sat there for a few more moments, the weight of the day pressing down on her. Then she rose, her chair scraping softly against the floor as she pushed it back. Still, she felt compelled to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rest up,” she said quietly. “Your baby’s waiting for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked out of the room, she couldn’t shake the thought that this woman and her baby were somehow tied to her now, their stories tangled up with hers in a way she hadn’t anticipated. It wasn’t her case anymore—not officially—but she knew she wouldn’t stop checking in. Not until she had answers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slid into her car, the engine humming to life as she buckled in. Before heading home, she quickly typed out a text to Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Alright, count us in for Disney on Ice. Let’s do it.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send, a small smile tugging at her lips. It felt good to give in to something fun for Nicky</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s reply came quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yay! We’re gonna have so much fun. I’ll send you the details when i get home”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha read the message with a slight chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Alright, I’ll send the money to you later today!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>With a deep breath, she started the drive, the familiar route home ahead of her. It was going to be a long weekend, but at least there was something to look forward to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha drove through the quiet streets, her mind wandered to the days since her move to Minnesota. The chill in the air, the unfamiliar roads, and even the people felt like a new chapter she wasn’t entirely sure she was ready for. But as she thought about the night with Wanda and Mariah at the bar, the unexpected invitation to Disney on Ice for her and Nicky, and the simple act of settling into something unfamiliar, a small flicker of hope sparked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe, just maybe, moving here wasn’t such a bad idea. It wasn’t home yet, not completely, but it was a fresh start. And for the first time in a long while, Agatha felt a faint possibility that things could, perhaps, get better.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Monday morning was crisp as Agatha bundled up Nicky in his warm jacket before walking him out to the daycare garden. His small hand was tucked into hers as he eagerly chattered about his plans for the day. Agatha smiled softly, watching him run ahead toward his friends, already lost in the world of the playground. She gave him a quick wave, then turned to head back to the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet of the house felt oddly comforting. Agatha moved through the kitchen, making a quick cup of coffee before starting on the small chores she hadn’t gotten to earlier in the weekend. Though she had a housekeeper who cleaned and cooked for her, Agatha couldn’t quite shake the habit of doing little things around the house when she had the time—putting away dishes, wiping down counters, making sure the house was in order. It helped her feel grounded, even if it was just for a short time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With everything in place, she glanced at the clock and mentally prepared herself for the next task—picking up Nicky. She had a surprise planned for him, something she hadn't told him about yet. A small part of her enjoyed the secrecy, watching him squirm with curiosity when she mentioned it. It was a spontaneous plan, but after the chaos of the last few weeks, Agatha knew they both needed something fun, something light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few final touches, Agatha grabbed her keys and headed for the door, her mind already on the excitement of picking up Nicky. She couldn’t wait to see his reaction. She could already picture his face lighting up when she told him they were going to Disney on Ice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arrived at the daycare and parked just outside the building. She could see Nicky through the window, his face pressed against the glass as he spotted her car pulling up. A wide grin spread across his face, and he was already racing toward the door before it even fully opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mom!" he shouted, practically bouncing on his feet as he burst outside, his little arms stretched wide for a hug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled as she opened the door, crouching down to catch him. "Hey, buddy. How was your day?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Good! I painted a zebra today!" Nicky's excitement was contagious, and Agatha felt a surge of pride. He had such a bright spark in his eyes that it made everything feel worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m glad to hear that," Agatha replied, standing up and taking his hand. "Now, I’ve got something special for you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes widened, curiosity sparking immediately. "A surprise?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave him a mysterious smile. "Yep. But you have to be patient and not ask too many questions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>He huffed, dramatically crossing his arms. "Is it something cool? Like a toy or ice cream?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, trying to hide her smile. "You’ll see when we get there. It’s better than all of that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Better than ice cream?" Nicky’s voice went up a notch in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Way better," she teased, ruffling his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They climbed into the car, and Agatha started the engine, glancing back at him through the rearview mirror. "So, what do you think the surprise could be?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky stared out the window for a moment, thinking. "Hmm... a trip to the zoo?" He looked back at her, eyes sparkling with hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe," Agatha said with a playful wink, "but not today."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky let out a dramatic sigh and settled back in his seat, the mystery of the surprise hanging in the air like a tangible thing. As they drove, he kept throwing out guesses—nothing quite right, but each one more excited than the last. Agatha’s heart lightened with every passing moment, her earlier exhaustion from the workday slowly slipping away as she watched him get lost in the anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled up in front of the Disney on Ice venue, Nicky froze. His jaw dropped, eyes wide, his little hands clutching the armrest like he was bracing for takeoff.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are we, Mom?” he asked, his voice full of awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Disney on Ice,” Agatha said slowly, glancing at him with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Disney on Ice?” he whispered, turning to her with a look of pure disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha unbuckled her seatbelt, still smiling. “Yup. I thought you might like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky didn’t say another word. Instead, he launched himself at her, wrapping his arms around her neck in a tight hug. “Best. Surprise. Ever!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, her heart swelling. “I’m glad you like it, buddy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped out of the car and made their way toward the venue, Nicky’s eyes grew even wider, darting from the colorful signs to the buzzing families around them. The earlier disbelief on his face had morphed into pure, unfiltered excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then he tugged on her hand and asked, “Mom… What's Disney on Ice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, a little stunned. </span>
<em>
<span>Right.</span>
</em>
<span> She’d forgotten that Nicky probably had no clue what this was. Crouching down to his level as they neared the entrance, she tried her best to explain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Disney on Ice is like... well, it's like a giant ice skating show, but with all of your favorite Disney characters." She paused, watching his face for signs of recognition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Skating? Like Elsa?" Nicky asked, his voice full of hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Exactly!" Agatha laughed, nodding enthusiastically. "Elsa, Anna, and all their friends will be skating around on the ice, doing special tricks and dances. They even have cool scenes from the movies where they bring the magic to life right before your eyes"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes lit up as the thought sank in. "So, there’s going to be ice, and magic... and Elsa?!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yep. And more than that," Agatha added, grinning at his excitement. "There will be other characters too, like Mickey Mouse, and maybe even Moana. It's going to be a whole big adventure."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky's small hand shot up into the air, his voice full of wonder. "And there will be singing? And dancing? And ice?" His energy was practically vibrating through him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, all of that and more." Agatha laughed, taking his hand and guiding him through the crowd. "I think you're going to love it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>While they walked  through the parking lot Nicky kept glancing back at her, as if he still couldn’t quite believe it was real. His wide grin and excited chatter were contagious, filling Agatha with a warm sense of pride. She’d been a little uncertain about the whole idea, but seeing him so happy, so swept up in the magic, made every bit of effort worth it. This was the kind of moment she’d been searching for—a day where the world outside faded away, leaving just the joy they shared together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha and Nicky approached the entrance, a cheerful voice called out, cutting through the background noise of laughter and chatter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Over here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to see Wanda waving enthusiastically, a vibrant grin on her face. Beside her were two boys, identical in appearance but already exuding distinct personalities. One of them had a mischievous twinkle in his eye, while the other stood a little more reserved, clutching a stuffed animal in one hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Wanda,” Agatha said,</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boys stared up at Nicky with curiosity, and before Agatha could say anything, Wanda gestured toward them. “Agatha, meet my twins—Billy and Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of them, the more outgoing of the two, grinned. “Hi!” he said, his voice filled with confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” the other one added softly, giving a small wave but staying close to Wanda’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nudged Nicky forward gently. “This is my son, Nicky” she introduced, her voice carrying a hint of pride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice to finally meet you Nicky” Wanda said, ushering her kids forward with a bright smile, her energy effortlessly infectious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the boys practically bounced on his heels, his excitement bubbling over. “Hi! I’m Billy!” he exclaimed, waving enthusiastically. He had his mother’s red hair and a mischievous grin that made him instantly endearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tommy, on the other hand, was a bit more reserved, his bright brown eyes studying Nicky with curiosity. "Hey," he said softly, his expression friendly but cautious. He held out his hand shyly, and Nicky took it eagerly, shaking it with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, thrilled to meet new friends, took Tommy’s hand eagerly and shook it. “Hi, I’m Nicky!” he replied, his grin widening as he looked between the twins. “This is gonna be awesome!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda watched the exchange with a proud smile and leaned over to Agatha. “They’re good kids,” she said warmly. “Billy’s the adventurous one, always looking for the next big thing. Tommy’s a little quieter, but he’s just as sweet. I think they’re going to get along great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was about to say more, a tall man approached, his posture relaxed but his steps purposeful. He looked like he was about to greet Wanda, but his eyes flicked to Agatha with polite curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, babe,” he said casually, placing a hand on Wanda’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! Vision,” Wanda said brightly. “This is Agatha”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small nod, taking him in—calm demeanor, neatly dressed, and with a quiet charm that made sense next to Wanda’s vibrant energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this is Vision,” Wanda added, glancing at Agatha. “My partner”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision acknowledges Agatha with a smile extending a hand. “Nice to finally meet you Agatha. Wanda has spoken very highly of you”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Likewise,” Agatha replied, shaking his hand briefly before stepping back, feeling slightly out of place in the easy familial dynamic unfolding before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda clapped her hands lightly. “Well, looks like the kids are hitting it off already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at Nicky, who was now animatedly leading Billy and Tommy toward a nearby display. She sighed, a small but genuine smile forming. “Yeah, looks like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she spoke, Vision stepped forward, crouching down to Nicky’s level with a kind smile. “Hey, Nicky. I’m Vision. Are you ready to see some magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah! I’ve never seen anything like this before! Are you here for the show too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision chuckled, straightening up. “That’s the plan. But I’m mostly here to make sure everyone has a good time—and to keep an eye on these two,” he added with a teasing glance at Billy and Tommy. “Sometimes their excitement gets a little… </span>
<em>
<span>energetic</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy, overhearing, shot Vision a playful look. “We’re not wild, Dad. We’re just excited!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course you are,” Vision replied with mock seriousness, his eyes sparkling. “But let’s all agree to stay in our seats this time, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda winked at Agatha. “Vision’s the peacekeeper in the family. He keeps us all grounded.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Nicky was already deep in conversation with the twins. “Let’s sit together!” he suggested excitedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s eyes lit up. “Yes! Best idea ever”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the group made their way to their inside of the venue  Wanda leaned toward Agatha, her expression warm. “It’s so nice to see everyone getting along so well. I have a feeling this is going to be a great night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, taking a moment to soak it all in—the bright lights, the sound of happy chatter, and Nicky’s pure, unfiltered joy. “Yeah,” she agreed softly. “It really is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the group made their way through the venue, Wanda took the lead, expertly navigating the crowd with a casual confidence that suggested she’d done this plenty of times before. Agatha followed, keeping an eye on Nicky, who was practically vibrating with excitement as he chatted nonstop with Billy and Tommy about dinosaurs, superheroes, and all the wonders they expected to see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until they arrived at their destination—an arena with rows of seats encircling a large, open ice rink—that Agatha noticed where Wanda was leading them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” Agatha said, glancing around as Wanda confidently marched toward the front. “These are... front row seats?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda turned and gave Agatha a sly smile. “Of course. Why wouldn’t they be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, taken aback. “You mean you planned it like this? Like, actually went out of your way to make sure you’d get us first row seats?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugged, her grin widening as she herded Billy and Tommy into their spots. “What can I say? I know people. And besides, it’s worth it to see the kids light up.” She gestured toward the boys, who were already clamoring to get the best view of the stage, their eyes wide with anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at Nicky, who was now standing on his tiptoes, craning his neck to see over the barrier separating the rink from the audience. His face was a mix of awe and glee, and she could practically see the gears turning in his head as he imagined what was about to happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me you were planning to sit in the back,” Wanda teased, her voice dripping with mock incredulity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, maybe,” Agatha said with a smirk. “Some of us aren’t out here pulling strings to impress six and four year-olds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed, a warm, genuine sound that made even Agatha smile despite herself. “Oh, come on, Harkness. Live a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help glancing back at Nicky, whose excitement was almost tangible. His little hands gripped the edge of the barrier, his eyes darting around as he took in every detail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned closer, her tone teasing. “See? Totally worth it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, crossing her arms. “Fine. You win this one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she settled into her seat, watching the kids buzz with excitement and chatter, she had to admit. Front row wasn’t such a bad place to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, feeling a sense of unexpected calm settle over her. As the show began and the lights dimmed further, the laughter and chatter of the group filled the air, making everything feel just a little less chaotic. Maybe, just maybe, these spontaneous moments were the kind that made life feel a bit more... magical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lights flickered, and the music began to swell, filling the arena with a sense of anticipation. The crowd’s excitement grew, and Nicky’s face lit up with wide-eyed wonder as the first characters took the stage. The ice glowed beneath the dazzling lights, the crystal-clear surface reflecting the performers' movements with a kind of magic only found in such a place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first segment of the show was an extravagant display of Disney's most beloved princesses. Agatha watched as Cinderella, Snow White, and Belle twirled across the ice, their costumes sparkling like diamonds. The elegance of their movements, the fluidity of the choreography, and the grandiose set pieces made it feel as if the fairy tales themselves were coming to life right before their eyes. Nicky was practically bouncing in his seat, his eyes glued to the performers, a wide smile stretched across his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the show progressed, characters from </span>
<em>
<span>The Lion King</span>
</em>
<span> appeared, with Simba and Nala gliding gracefully across the ice. The transition from the fairy tale princesses to the wild savannah was seamless, with vibrant colors filling the arena. The giant lion costumes—especially one designed to look like Mufasa—were breathtaking, and the children let out gasps of awe at the sheer scale of the production. The dancers mimicked the powerful, yet graceful movements of the animals, while dramatic projections of the African landscape played on the backdrop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha found herself drawn into the spectacle, the magic of the show pulling her in, even as she tried to maintain her usual level of cool detachment. She glanced at Wanda, who was clearly enjoying the show as much as the kids. Wanda’s eyes were filled with joy as she watched her twins’ reactions, laughing along with them. It was hard not to be swept up in the energy of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The final act was the most thrilling—a high-energy performance featuring Elsa and Anna from </span>
<em>
<span>Frozen</span>
</em>
<span>. The ice rink was transformed into a wintry kingdom, complete with swirling snowflakes and shimmering blue lights. Elsa’s ice powers were brought to life in stunning special effects as she "created" ice sculptures that seemed to materialize in midair. The arena was filled with snowflakes falling from above, and the sound of </span>
<em>
<span>Let It Go</span>
</em>
<span> reverberated through the crowd, everyone singing along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was completely captivated by the sight. “Mom, look! It’s Elsa! She’s making snow!” he exclaimed, his voice full of awe. Agatha couldn’t help but smile at his enthusiasm, the little moments of wonder reminding her that there was so much magic to be found, even in the simplest things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout the performance, there were moments where the performers would skate close to the edge of the rink, and the kids in the front row would reach out their hands, almost as if they could touch the characters. The energy in the arena was electric, with everyone cheering, clapping, and laughing together. Even the adults couldn’t help but get caught up in the infectious joy of the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the show finally came to an end, the lights slowly came back up, and the performers took their final bows, waving to the crowd. Nicky, Billy, and Tommy stood up, clapping furiously and shouting their approval. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was amazing!” Nicky yelled, his voice filled with genuine excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, laughing, gave Agatha a playful look. “See? I told you it would be a good time. You’ve got a future ice-skater here,” she teased, nudging Agatha with her elbow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head with a grin. “I don’t know about that,” she replied, watching as Nicky bounced on his heels. "But he’s definitely got some enthusiasm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire group lingered for a moment, taking in the last bits of the performance as the arena slowly emptied out. The laughter, the chatter, the lingering joy—it was a perfect moment of shared happiness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they made their way out of the arena, Nicky clutched her hand tightly, his face flushed with excitement. “Mom, that was the best day ever!” he declared, his voice filled with a sense of wonder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at Wanda, feeling a sense of gratitude for the unexpected joy of the night. Maybe it hadn’t been such a bad idea, after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped out of the arena, Billy and Tommy were already buzzing with excitement. “Mom, can we go to the mall?” Tommy asked, practically bouncing on his toes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, please, Mom? There’s an arcade there! And they have this cool new racing game!” Billy chimed in, his enthusiasm infectious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised an eyebrow, glancing at Vision, who nodded indulgently. “Well, I suppose we could. It’s not too late,” Wanda said thoughtfully, then turned to Agatha. “What do you think? Would Nicky like to join them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. Nicky was practically vibrating with excitement at the mention of the arcade, his big eyes fixed on her pleadingly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, can I? Please? I’ll be super good!” he promised, tugging on her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, torn. “I don’t know…” She trailed off, glancing between Wanda and Vision. “It’s been a long day, and I don’t want him running wild when he’s already this wired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on,” Wanda said, waving a hand dismissively. “The kids will be fine. Vision can take them to the arcade while we hit a few stores. It’ll give us a chance to catch up, and they’ll burn off some of that energy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision smiled warmly, his tone reassuring. “I’d be happy to watch them, Agatha. I’ll keep a close eye on all three, and I promise they won’t get into any trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced down at Nicky, whose face was a mix of hope and excitement. It was hard to say no when he looked so eager. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she relented with a sigh, “but only if you promise to behave and stick with Vision the whole time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promise!” Nicky practically shouted, bouncing up and down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” Wanda said with a grin, linking her arm through Agatha’s. “Let’s go, then. Shopping and some adult conversation are exactly what you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile at Wanda’s enthusiasm, even as she mentally braced herself for what the next hour might hold. Together, they all headed for the mall, the kids already chattering excitedly about what games they would play at the arcade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrived, Vision took charge of the boys, guiding them toward the neon-lit entrance of the arcade, while Agatha and Wanda veered off toward the nearby shops. “Relax,” Wanda said, giving her a nudge. “They’ll be fine. Trust me, Vision’s practically a saint.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure he is,” Agatha muttered, watching as Nicky waved at her before disappearing into the arcade with Billy and Tommy. She couldn’t help but feel a little anxious, though she knew Nicky was in good hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, come on,” Wanda said, tugging her toward a chic boutique. “Let’s see if we can find you something that isn’t black or purple. You know, a little color wouldn’t kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but followed along, resigned to the fact that Wanda wasn’t going to let her leave without at least one new outfit. "You’re relentless, Maximoff," she muttered, but there was a hint of amusement in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mall buzzed with weekend energy—teenagers wandering in packs, families bustling from store to store, and holiday sales signs screaming for attention. Agatha followed Wanda through the crowd, occasionally glancing back toward the arcade, even though it was out of sight. She tried not to think about how the boys were faring under Vision’s supervision, but Wanda’s chatter kept her mostly distracted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They hit a few stores, starting with a boutique full of bohemian-style dresses that Wanda insisted were </span>
<em>
<span>"so in right now"</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried on exactly nothing, instead standing guard with their shopping bags while Wanda modeled a rust-colored wrap dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m telling you, you’d look amazing in something like this,” Wanda said as she adjusted the neckline in the mirror. “It’s flowy but flattering. You’re all sharp angles; this would soften you up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Agatha said dryly, but there was no real sting to her words. She was too used to Wanda’s relentless commentary.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their next stop was a home goods store where Wanda ogled quirky throw pillows while Agatha discreetly checked her phone for messages from Vision. Nothing yet, which she decided to take as a good sign.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they moved through the mall, Wanda suddenly came to an abrupt halt, her eyes lighting up like she’d struck gold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed her gaze and she spotted a lingerie store. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooooh perfect timing” Wanda said enthusiastically, grabbing Agatha’s arm. “We’re going in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha balked. “Oh hell no”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on!” Wanda said, practically dragging her toward the entrance. “I need to pick up a couple of things anyway. Vision’s been very...appreciative of these little trips lately, and I could use a refresh. And you…” she added, her grin turning mischievous, “should grab something too. Maybe spice things up a little”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I have to?” Agatha groaned, attempting to keep walking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Wanda said firmly, steering her toward the entrance. “I’m just saying, a little effort never hurts. Plus, you never know when you’ll need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned but allowed herself to be pulled inside, instantly feeling out of place amid the racks of lacy bras, silk robes, and barely-there underwear. The store smelled like vanilla and roses, and the lighting was uncomfortably flattering. There were racks of delicate items in every shade imaginable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda dove right in, flipping through racks with ease, confidence palpable, while Agatha lingered awkwardly near the entrance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you really going to just stand there?” Wanda asked, holding up a fiery red lace bodysuit. “You should pick something out too. You never know when it’ll come in handy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not seeing anyone,” Agatha said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So?” Wanda replied, barely looking up from the rack she was browsing. “It’s not always about someone else. Sometimes it’s about feeling good for </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood stiffly, her arms crossed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, Agatha, stop hovering like a suspicious mom at prom. Come pick something out,” Wanda called over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, thanks,” Agatha said tightly, while rolling her eyes but begrudgingly followed Wanda through the store. She wasn’t about to let the closest thing she had to a friend  in this new city go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, of course, was in her element, piling bras, panties, and slips into her arms. “This would be amazing on you,” she said, her tone matter-of-fact,  holding up a sheer black slip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face flushed. “Absolutely not,” she said, trying to wave her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Wanda pressed, her grin widening. “Live a little. It’s not like anyone has to see it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s exactly why I don’t need it,” Agatha retorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Wanda wasn’t letting up. She piled a few items into Agatha’s arms, ignoring her protests. “Here,” she said, thrusting a few things into Agatha’s hands. “Try these. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the pile of delicate garments, most of them far skimpier than anything she’d ever even considered wearing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“These are barely clothes.” she said, exasperated, holding up a bralette that looked more like a suggestion of clothing than an actual piece. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the point,” Wanda replied, her grin widening “Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuffled toward the dressing room, grumbling under her breath feeling both self-conscious and annoyed. She pushed the door closed behind her and eyed the pile of lingerie like it was a puzzle she didn’t particularly want to solve. Once inside, she stared at the pile of delicate fabrics with growing dread. Most of the pieces Wanda had chosen for her were daring: sheer bodysuits, bralettes with intricate lace patterns, and matching sets in bold, vibrant colors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated, her fingers brushing against the fabric. What was the point of lingerie anyway? She’d always considered herself pragmatic, bordering on prudish when it came to this sort of thing. If no one else was going to see it, why bother? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, some part of her—a deeply buried part—felt intrigued. It wasn’t about anyone else, was it? Maybe it was about feeling... something for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed and tried on one of the simpler pieces, a satin bralette and matching shorts in a deep navy blue. Looking at her reflection, she felt a flush of embarrassment creeping up her neck. The outfit was flattering, even elegant, but it was so far outside her comfort zone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried on a black lace set after that, studying her reflection with a mix of discomfort and curiosity. It wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>bad</span>
</em>
<span>, exactly—it was just... a lot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re such a prude,” she muttered to herself, rolling her eyes at her own reaction</span>
</p><p>
<span>She decided she was done with whatever this stupid game was. But as she was changing, something caught her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A purple lace set.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was bold, almost scandalous, with intricate floral patterns that barely concealed anything and delicate straps that criss crossed in the back. She hesitated, her hand hovering over it before she quickly grabbed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is ridiculous,” she muttered to herself, but she couldn’t look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The set felt both daring and alluring in a way she couldn’t explain. It wasn’t something she’d normally choose, if ever, but there was something captivating about it. Instead of trying it on, she folded it neatly and set it aside to buy, deciding it was too much for even her to confront in the store.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally emerged from the dressing room, Wanda was waiting, her arms full of her own finds. “Well?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood there, her mind racing as she considered her options. She could tell Wanda the truth—that out of all the pieces, she’d only found one thing she liked—and risk her friend’s inevitable curiosity leading to her seeing the scandalous purple set. Or, she could avoid the conversation entirely by buying everything Wanda had picked out for her, even the items she had no intention of ever wearing. The thought of admitting she’d liked something as revealing as the purple lace was mortifying; she didn’t want Wanda to know she’d been captivated by it. She couldn't believe it herself if she was honest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The decision felt ridiculous, but her pride won out. She gave a quick nod to herself, her cheeks flushed. Wanda would never know, and that was all that mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “Don’t make a thing out of it.” she said while refusing to meet Wanda's eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed, clearly enjoying herself. “Oh, I’m absolutely making a thing out of it. Look at you, branching out. I’m proud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just pay and go,” Agatha said, grabbing the shopping bag and striding toward the register, her face still warm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stood in line, shifting uncomfortably under the weight of the lacy bundle in her arms, a prickle of awareness ran down her spine. The sensation of being watched was unmistakable, and she froze momentarily, her heart skipping a beat. Subtly, she glanced to the side, catching the faintest hint of brown hair in her peripheral vision. Her breath hitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head sharply to confirm, her stomach twisting in a mix of dread and embarrassment. But when she scanned the store, she saw no familiar figure, just a cluster of shoppers bustling about, entirely indifferent to her and the stack of lingerie in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, heat creeping up her neck.</span>
<em>
<span> I’m imagining things. I have to be</span>
</em>
<b>.</b>
<span> The thought didn’t do much to calm her nerves, though. Her pulse thundered, the mortification settling in heavy and hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned against the counter as they shuffled forward in line, her sharp eyes narrowing as she studied Agatha’s pale face and darting gaze. “Okay, what is with you?” she asked, a smirk tugging at her lips. “You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, clutching the bundle of lingerie to her chest as though it might shield her from further scrutiny. “I didn’t see anything,” she said firmly, though the tremor in her voice betrayed her. “ I thought I saw someone I knew, but it was nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s grin widened, clearly not buying her nonchalance. “Uh-huh. You’re as white as a sheet, Agatha. Don’t think I didn’t notice that little jump you did back there. You practically dropped your... </span>
<em>
<span>delicates</span>
</em>
<span>.” She raised an eyebrow suggestively, glancing at the stack of lingerie in Agatha’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, her cheeks burning. “It’s nothing, Wanda. Drop it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Wanda wasn’t done. “Oh, no, this is </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> something. Did you see someone who shouldn’t know you’ve got a secret stash of lacey confidence boosters?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped toward Wanda, her mortification now fully on display. “Wanda!” she hissed. “Keep your voice down!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda barked a laugh, throwing her head back dramatically. “I knew it! You’re terrible at hiding things, Harkness. Come on, who was it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together in a tight line, refusing to give Wanda the satisfaction. “I didn’t see anyone,” she repeated. “Just... leave it, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda studied her for a moment longer, her amusement only growing. “Fine,” she said finally, though her tone was anything but sincere. “But if you start hyperventilating over there, don’t expect me to revive you. I’d hate for the paramedics to find you clutching your stash like your life depended on it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned again, wishing the line would move faster so she could escape. </span>
<b>I’m never going shopping with Wanda again.</b>
</p><p>
<span>As they left the store Agatha's cheeks burning as if everyone in the store could see through the bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was still grinning, and Agatha couldn’t help but shake her head at her friend’s persistence. But deep down, she had to admit—just barely—that maybe Wanda had a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda couldn’t resist one last comment. “You know,” she said, her tone light but knowing, “sometimes it’s the things we think are too much that end up being just right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Save the wisdom for your wedding vows,” Agatha shot back, though her tone lacked any real bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked but let it go, clearly satisfied she’d nudged Agatha out of her comfort zone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Deep down, she couldn’t stop thinking about the purple set. It felt like a tiny rebellion—a risk, just as Wanda had said. Maybe that wasn’t such a bad thing.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky arrived home late that evening, the day’s excitement still buzzing faintly in the air. Nicky ran inside, chattering about the arcade games and how much fun he had with Billy and Tommy. Agatha followed, carrying her only bag with a sense of relief to finally be home. After a quick dinner and bedtime routine, Nicky fell asleep, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts. She unpacked the shopping bag, her eyes lingering on the purple lace set for a moment before shoving it into a drawer, her cheeks warming at the memory of picking it out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next three days passed in a blur of routine. Agatha slipped back into her life as though the break at Disney on Ice had been a dream. Mornings were spent waking Nicky, getting him ready, and dropping him off at daycare before heading to the hospital. Her days were packed with surgeries, patient rounds, and the endless mountain of administrative work that came with her job. She terrorized the residents as usual, demanding precision and discipline in every aspect of their work. They scrambled under her sharp gaze, and she allowed herself a sliver of satisfaction at their growing competence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lunches and coffee breaks occasionally broke up the monotony. Wanda and Mariah became her frequent companions during these moments, their easy banter a welcome distraction. Wanda, in particular, had a way of making Agatha laugh when she needed it most, though she never let herself enjoy it too much outwardly. Mariah’s grounded, no-nonsense attitude balanced out Wanda’s playful teasing, creating a strange but comforting trio that Agatha found herself growing accustomed to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was there, of course. Agatha saw her in passing, their schedules overlapping just enough for their paths to cross. Rio didn’t approach her, but her presence was impossible to ignore. That infuriating smirk was a constant, as if Rio knew exactly how to get under her skin without saying a single word. Agatha hated how aware she was of her, her mind fixating on those fleeting encounters far more than she cared to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The days were busy, leaving little time to dwell on anything outside the hospital. Yet, the absence of updates on the woman and baby from the accident lingered at the back of her mind. Every time she checked their charts or consulted the ICU team, it was the same response: no significant changes. The mother remained in a coma, her prognosis uncertain, while the baby’s condition, though slightly improved, was still precarious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the third evening, Agatha sat in her quiet living room, sipping a glass of wine and staring at her phone. This life in Minnesota—this new routine—was beginning to feel familiar. Almost normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the hum of her evening routine settled around her, Agatha’s thoughts drifted to Nicky’s upcoming birthday. The realization hit her like a wave—she hadn’t done anything to prepare yet. There were decisions to be made: the theme, the guest list, and, of course, she needed to call her ex husband. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach twisted at the thought of calling him. They weren't exactly on speaking terms. The idea of hearing his voice, of navigating the delicate balance of civility for Nicky’s sake, filled her with dread. It wasn’t just the pain of their failed marriage that lingered; it was the anger, the resentment, and the lingering wounds she tried to keep buried. But she knew this call couldn’t be avoided. Daniel was still Nicky’s father, and their shared love for him meant Agatha had to set aside her pride, at least for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a long, frustrated sigh as she sank into the couch. The thought of Daniel’s presence at Nicky’s birthday, of him seeing her was almost unbearable. She had worked so hard to build a life outside of their fractured past, a life that felt like it was finally hers. Inviting him into that new world, even if it was for Nicky’s sake, felt like a betrayal to the version of herself she was trying so desperately to hold on to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want him to see the way her life had taken shape without him in it. It was one thing to share custody of Nicky, to remain civil when it came to their son. But this….this was different. This was an invitation to let him back in, if only for a day. It felt like opening a door she had worked so hard to lock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Nicky was relentless. He wanted his father there. He specifically asked her. Agatha couldn’t bring herself to deny him that, no matter how much the thought of it made her stomach churn. Her son deserved both of his parents to be there, even if it meant pretending for a few hours, even if it meant biting her tongue and swallowing the bitter taste of regret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she picked up her phone, her fingers hovered over the screen. The message she was about to send felt like a weight on her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span> "Hi, Daniel. We’re planning Nicky’s birthday . He’d really like for you to be there. Please let me know when i can call you so we can figure something out" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hated the simplicity of it, hated how it made her feel like a mother caught between two worlds. But there was no other way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hit send, the action too quick to stop, but she couldn’t bring herself to read the message again. Instead, she tossed the phone onto the couch beside her and buried her face in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why does it always come back to him?" she whispered, frustration bubbling in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew the answer: Nicky. Because, despite everything, he was their son. And this was the world they had to navigate for his sake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was Nat. She had been reaching out steadily over the past two months since she quit her job at NYU. Agatha had avoided every call, ignored every text. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to talk to Nat—it was that she couldn’t. Not yet. There was too much to say and too many feelings she didn’t know how to put into words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, the ache of their silence gnawed at her. Nat had been there through everything, thick and thin. She didn’t deserve the radio silence. Agatha set her jaw, grabbed her phone, and scrolled through her contacts until she found Nat’s name. The sight of it made her chest tighten. With a deep breath, she tapped the call button.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The line rang twice before a familiar voice, warm and tinged with surprise, answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Agatha?” Nat’s voice was bright, the kind of bright that made it clear she’d been waiting for this call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Nat,” Agatha said, her voice soft and hesitant. “It’s been a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>fucking bitch</span>
</em>
<span>!” Nat exploded, not missing a beat. “Are you shitting me right now? </span>
<em>
<span>Seriously</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha. You’ve been MIA for </span>
<em>
<span>months</span>
</em>
<span>, and all I get is a goddamn ‘Hey, Nat, it’s been a while’? What the actual </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> is wrong with you? I should fucking murder you right now. I swear to God, I hope you’re sitting down because I’m about to verbally eviscerate your sorry ass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, holding the phone slightly away from her ear as Nat’s words came rapid-fire, each one landing like a slap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I called you, what, like a thousand fucking times? Texted you more than that. I was fucking worried, Agatha. Do you have any idea how much that pisses me off? Any? Of course you don’t, because you’re a goddamn coward who thinks she can just fucking disappear and everyone will be fine with it. Well, newsflash to you asshole: we’re not fine. I’m not fine. You’re not allowed to ghost me, you absolute fucking piece of shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but Nat was on a roll.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And </span>
<em>
<span>Minnesota</span>
</em>
<span>? Really? Are you fucking kidding me? You move halfway across the fucking country, and I find out from your </span>
<em>
<span>Instagram</span>
</em>
<span>? Which, by the way, looks like it’s from the goddamn Stone Age because you haven’t updated that shit since 2009. What the fuck, Agatha? What the </span>
<em>
<span>actual</span>
</em>
<span> fuck? Do you have any idea how it feels to realize your best friend has dropped off the face of the Earth and didn’t think to clue you in?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced. “Nat, I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, don’t ‘Nat, I’ me,” she snapped. “I’m not done. So youre gonna have to shut your mouth and let me finish.  You’ve been my best friend for, what, more than two decades? And you think it’s okay to pull this silent-treatment crap? Like, what the hell am I supposed to do with that? I thought you and your pathetic ass were dead for a hot minute! But then I remembered—oh, right—Agatha is too much of a stubborn </span>
<em>
<span>bitch</span>
</em>
<span> to die without leaving some passive-aggressive bullshit behind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help it—she laughed, a small chuckle that grew into full-on laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, okay? You’re right. I’m an asshole. I should’ve called sooner,” she admitted, her voice tinged with guilt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn fucking </span>
<em>
<span>straight</span>
</em>
<span>, you should’ve,” Nat snapped, though her voice softened slightly. “You don’t get to ditch me just because life gets hard. That’s not how this works, you fucking disaster excuse of a human being.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now. “I just... I needed some space. Things have been messy, and I didn’t want to dump all of that on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat let out an exaggerated sigh, the kind Agatha knew well, the one Nat used when she was both frustrated and amused. “Honestly, you’re so dramatic. Agatha, I don’t care how messy things are. You don’t get to decide I can’t handle it. That’s not your call to make. I’m not fragile, Agatha and you’re not a burden and I’m not going anywhere. If you needed space, I get it. I’ve been through everything with you. You really think I can’t handle a little more chaos?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, the lump in her throat making it difficult to speak. “I’m sorry, Nat. I mean it. I just... I didn’t know how to talk about everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Start with the basics,” Nat said, her tone gentler now but still firm. “Are you okay? Is Nicky okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we’re okay,” Agatha said, a small smile tugging at her lips. “He’s doing great. He loves Minnesota. I think he likes the snowy weather more than you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat laughed. “Of course he does, I taught him well. So, what’s the deal? Are you finally ready to act like I exist again, or is this a one-time pity call?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then took a deep breath. “Actually, I was calling for a reason. Nicky’s birthday is coming up, and I was hoping you could make it. He misses you, and, well... so do I.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat was quiet for a moment before she said, “Of course I’ll come. Like hell I’d miss it. Just give me the date, and I’ll be there. But Agatha, if you ever ghost me again, I’m showing up at your house and making your life a living hell. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again, feeling the weight of the past few months start to lift. “Got it. No more ghosting. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a brief pause before Nat’s voice softened. “ Tell him I’ll be there. And don’t you dare make me come to that party without some good cake, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a sense of warmth spreading through her. “Deal. It wouldn’t be a party without cake. I’ll make sure it’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. Now, tell me everything,” Nat said, her voice lighter now. “And don’t you dare leave out the messy bits. You know those are my favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They talked for nearly an hour, the conversation a balm for Agatha’s weary soul. Nat caught her up on her life in New York—her chaotic schedule, a tricky surgery she’d performed, and a funny story about a clueless intern who mistook a scrub nurse for an attending. Agatha laughed, genuinely laughed, at Nat’s spot-on impression of the mortified intern trying to backpedal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was her turn, Agatha shared snippets of her new life: how much Nicky loved his new daycare, the charm of the small Minnesota town, and the slightly slower pace of the hospital compared to her previous job. She even mentioned Wanda and Mariah and how she terrorized the residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she avoided the more vulnerable parts. She didn’t mention how lonely the nights could feel or how she sometimes doubted her decision to leave New York. Most of all, she didn’t mention Rio. It was too raw, too complicated, and she wasn’t ready to unpack it—not even with Nat or herself even.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat seemed to sense Agatha’s guardedness, but she didn’t push. Instead, she filled the silences with light-hearted anecdotes, seamlessly steering the conversation whenever it veered too close to dangerous territory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the weather” Agatha said at one point, shaking her head even though Nat couldn’t see her. “Don’t get me started. Nicky loves it. Meanwhile, I’m slipping on ice every time I step outside. It’s like nature’s way of telling me I don’t belong here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat chuckled. “You? Slipping on ice? That’s a mental image I’m going to treasure. Did you get snow boots?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did,” Agatha admitted. “And they make me look like a Yeti.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better a stylish Yeti than a bruised one,” Nat quipped. “I’ll get you a matching parka.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation meandered, touching on everything and nothing. By the time they said their goodbyes, Agatha felt lighter, like she’d set down a weight she hadn’t realized she was carrying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Nat,” she said softly, just before they hung up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what?” Nat’s voice was warm, teasing but kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For being you,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, and then Nat replied, her tone playful again, “You’re damn right. And don’t you forget it. I'll see you in a few days”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha set her phone down, a small smile lingered on her lips feeling a small sense of relief. Reconnecting with Nat hadn’t solved everything, but it was a start. And even though she still had to face Daniel and the looming task of planning Nicky’s birthday, for now, she felt a little less alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fell asleep that night with an unfamiliar but welcome sense of ease. For once, her mind wasn’t buzzing with unfinished tasks or tangled thoughts. The warmth of her conversation with Nat lingered, and she let it carry her into a deep, dreamless sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When morning came, it wasn’t the shrill beeping of her alarms that woke her—it was the sunlight streaming through the window and the realization that something was off. Very off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She jolted awake, her heart racing as she glanced at the clock on her nightstand. </span>
<b>6:47 a.m.</b>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit!” Agatha bolted upright, panic flooding her system. Her shift started at 7:00.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How had she slept through all three alarms? How had she not heard a single one? She scrambled out of bed, her thoughts a blur as she yanked on the first pair of scrubs she could find, threw her hair into a messy ponytail, and splashed cold water on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed on the counter, and Agatha snatched it up, squinting at the screen. A text from Mariah lit up the display:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Are you on your way? Chaos here. The shift was shit. I need to hand it over to you today apparently. Dr. Mahomes called in sick. Call me.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand over her face. Chaos. Of course, it would be chaos today. And of course, the on-call OB GYN had decided not to show up. Typical. “Useless idiot,” she muttered, already imagining the mess waiting for her at the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There wasn’t time for breakfast or even coffee. She barely paused long enough to text Nicky’s nanny, explaining that she’d need to cover for her this morning. The guilt came in waves as she realized she hadn’t even said good morning to Nicky. She’d barely glanced at his door in her rush to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get it together,” she muttered to herself, slinging her bag over her shoulder and grabbing her coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive to the hospital felt like a blur of traffic lights and frustrated glances at the clock. </span>
<b>7:27 a.m.</b>
<span> She should’ve been there half an hour ago, at least. She prided herself on being the one who never faltered, who had everything under control. This? This was unacceptable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip on the steering wheel tightened as she whispered. This wasn’t like her. Agatha prided herself on punctuality, on being the one who had everything under control. She didn’t do late. She didn’t do oversleeping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She parked her car crookedly in the hospital lot, barely taking the time to lock it before racing through the sliding doors. Inside, the energy was palpable—residents were darting down hallways, nurses looked harried, and the air buzzed with the chaos of an overbooked and understaffed shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, Dr. Harkness!” nurse Kale called out as she passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold that thought,” Agatha snapped back. “Rounds will have to wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She headed straight for her office, not even sparing a glance at her reflection in the glass walls as she tossed her bag inside. Her ponytail was half-falling apart, her scrubs slightly wrinkled, but there wasn’t time to care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah intercepted her at the door, her face a mixture of relief and pure exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank god you’re finally here,” Mariah said, pushing a tablet into Agatha’s hands. “We’ve got three women in labor, one of them already fully dilated. There’s also a possible pre-eclampsia case in triage, and the residents are...” She trailed off, gesturing vaguely in a way that screamed </span>
<em>
<span>lost cause</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic,” Agatha deadpanned, scanning the list of patients. “Any other catastrophes I should know about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah rolled her eyes. “Just the usual. Oh, and Dr. Mahomes? He didn’t even call the nurses. I had to cover his post-op follow-ups before my shift ended.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha muttered a curse under her breath. “Coward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah smirked but quickly sobered. “Are you good to jump in? I mean, you look like you haven’t had coffee in days, and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never better,” Agatha interrupted, tying her hair back and heading toward triage with long, purposeful strides. “Hand it over, Mariah. You’re officially off OBGYN duty. Go back to peds”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she pushed through the doors to triage, a frazzled-looking resident practically skidded to a stop in front of her, holding out a chart like it was a shield. His face was pale, his expression uncertain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness, the pre-eclampsia patient is asking for her husband, but he’s stuck in traffic—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snatched the chart without breaking stride, barely sparing him a glance. “Then inform her that I’m not only the next best thing—I’m the </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> thing. And unless her husband has a medical degree and a scalpel in hand, I’m all she’s got right now. Now get the fuck out of my way”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident blinked, stunned, before scrambling out of her way. Agatha rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, “I swear, they get greener every year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first delivery was underway before she even had time to catch her breath. The laboring mother was panicked, clutching the side rails of the hospital bed with white-knuckled intensity. Agatha swept in, calm but commanding, barking instructions to the nurses while gently reassuring the patient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re doing great,” she said firmly, positioning herself. “Now, I need you to push like you’re evicting a bad tenant. No half measures. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman gave a shaky nod, and within minutes, the cries of a newborn filled the room. Agatha handed the baby off to the waiting nurse with a rare, fleeting smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pre-eclampsia patient was next. Agatha moved quickly, her mind already cataloging the potential complications. The patient was young, terrified, and trying to keep herself together while clutching her swollen belly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” she rasped, her voice shaky. “Am I going to be okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re in the best hands possible,” Agatha replied without hesitation, her tone brisk but reassuring. “I’ve got this, and so do you. Now, we’re going to get that blood pressure down and make sure your baby gets to meet their badass mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The procedure went smoothly, despite the initial tension. By the time Agatha stepped out of the room, her scrubs were damp with sweat, but her mind was clear. She’d done what needed to be done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s phone buzzed just as she finished scrubbing out. Pulling it from her pocket, she saw a message from Dr. Calderu.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha, I hope you’re doing great. Dr. Gulliver from St. Cloud hospital came in and is taking over your rounds now. She’ll handle the shift afterward so you can focus on your cases. Let me know if you need anything else!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. The chaos of the morning was finally starting to untangle itself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly typed a reply:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Thanks, Dr. Calderu.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shoving her phone back into her pocket, Agatha adjusted her coat and turned toward the staff lounge. She needed a moment to regroup before diving back into the whirlwind of her cases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was shaping up to be a long day, but at least she could now give her full attention to her patients without worrying about the rest of the ward falling apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha headed down the hallway, she nearly bumped into Mariah, who was walking briskly toward the lounge with a clipboard in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, finally caught you,” Mariah said, eyeing her with a mix of curiosity and amusement. “How’s the morning treating you? You looked ready to murder someone earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp exhale. “It’s been... something. But Dr. Calderu just texted. Apparently, Dr. Gulliver from another hospital is taking over rounds and the rest of the shift. So I can focus on the cases that are piling up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh, Alice Gulliver? She’s cool. We like her. She covers for OBGYN all the time when things go sideways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha curled an eyebrow ignoring that Mariah called Dr Gulliver cool. “We like her? Since when do you hand out seals of approval to other doctors?”</span>
</p><p><span>Mariah smirked, crossing her arms. “</span> <span>Relax. She’s chill. Doesn’t pull rank unnecessarily, knows her stuff, and doesn’t leave a mess for us to clean up. Plus, she comes out for drinks with us sometimes”</span></p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Well, as long as she’s good for your after-work happy hours, I suppose I can trust her with the department.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn right,” Mariah replied with a grin. “Maybe we should go out tonight. We’re overdue for a drink, and I’m pretty sure even Alice has seen more of our team socially than you have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m flattered,” Agatha said dryly. “But I think I’ll leave the bonding to you and your favorite backup OB-GYN for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah shook her head, laughing as she walked away. “Suit yourself. Don’t say I didn’t try!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allowed herself a small smile as she watched Mariah disappear down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made her way to the NICU, her mind already shifting to the cases she needed to check on. The familiar hum of machines and soft beeping sounds greeted her as she entered the ward. She scanned the room, her eyes landing on a group of residents and nurses gathered around a bassinet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A steady, confident voice was leading the rounds, explaining a patient’s progress with calm authority. The atmosphere was notably serene—no squirming residents, no flustered nurses. It was almost... unsettling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t see who was speaking, but the tone carried an air of command that piqued her curiosity. Agatha approached, her heels clicking softly against the floor. “Good morning,” she said, her voice cutting through the quiet like a blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air shifted instantly, the circle of medical staff parting to make way for her. And that’s when she saw it—a flash of vibrant orange hair.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes traveled downward, taking in the figure leading the group. Combat boots. Jeans. A black tank top, of all things, under a rumpled white lab coat. It wasn’t just the hair—black with streaks of bright orange —it was the whole aesthetic. She looked like she’d wandered off a music festival stage and straight into a hospital ward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The doctor turned, catching sight of Agatha, and smiled brightly, extending a hand. “You must be Dr. Harkness. I’m Dr. Gulliver. We’ve already finished rounds—just going over a few finer details with the team.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand reflexively met hers in a firm shake, but her mind was reeling. Dr. Alice Gulliver, apparently. The name clicked—Mariah had mentioned her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome,” Agatha said, her voice carefully neutral. Her eyes, however, flicked to the group, noting their unusually relaxed postures. Everyone seemed uncharacteristically calm, as if Gulliver had sprinkled some kind of rebellious fairy dust over the ward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Gulliver gestured toward the bassinet they’d been discussing. “This little one is holding steady. No major changes since the last report, which, in our world, is good news. We’re keeping an eye on oxygen saturation levels, but the trend is positive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded stiffly. “I see. Thank you for stepping in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Gulliver turned back to the residents, Agatha couldn’t stop her thoughts from spiraling. What kind of self-respecting doctor dressed like that? Combat boots. Tinted hair. A </span>
<em>
<span>tank top.</span>
</em>
<span> She wasn’t just unorthodox; she was outright defying every unspoken rule of professional appearance Agatha held dear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the Mayo Clinic allowed this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened as she folded her arms, leaning against the nearest counter. She watched Gulliver address the group with easy confidence, her tone warm but authoritative. The residents hung on every word, nodding attentively. It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Infuriating because it was clear they liked her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t decide what unsettled her more: Gulliver’s complete disregard for decorum or the undeniable fact that she seemed competent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Dr. Gulliver breezed into her shift, the NICU seemed to hum with an odd blend of calm efficiency and the faint ripple of chaos that came with change. Agatha took a moment to survey the residents still lingering after rounds. Their postures were too relaxed, their expressions bordering on smug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, her tone brisk. “Alright, people. You’re still on the clock. NICU isn’t a place for complacency. Let’s review protocols for neonatal resuscitation, and I want assessments of every patient in your care before the end of the hour. Move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents scrambled, tension snapping back into place under her firm command. She folded her arms, a small, satisfied smile tugging at her lips. Authority restored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After another sweep of the ward, Agatha decided to grab a late lunch. She was halfway to the cafeteria when she spotted Rio sitting at a table near the window. As usual, Rio exuded that effortlessly confident air, casually leaning back in her chair, munching on a sandwich while scrolling through her phone. Agatha hesitated for a moment, then quickly made her way into the line, hoping Rio hadn’t noticed her. They hadn’t spoken since that dinner, and Agatha was certain the last thing she needed today was to deal with that infuriating woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept her head down as she grabbed a tray, mentally preparing herself for the chaos of the shift ahead. The last thing she wanted was to get roped into another one of Rio’s games.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was midway through grabbing a coffee in the hospital cafeteria when she heard the sound of footsteps behind her. Her heart sank. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. Of course, she would show up just when Agatha was trying to have a moment to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” Rio’s voice rang out, loud and teasing enough to turn a few heads. “If it isn’t Dr. Harkness herself, descending from her tower to grace us mere mortals with her presence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, her grip tightening on her cup. She’d been hoping for a quiet break, but of course, Rio had to ruin it.  She turned slowly, taking in the sight of Rio leaning against the counter  with infuriating ease, one arm casually slung over it. Her smirk was there, as usual—lopsided, confident, and entirely too knowing. For the first time since they met she was wearing scrubs. Not the hospital baggy ones. She was wearing black ones. The fitted material clung to her form in a way that Agatha hadn’t expected, highlighting the toned muscles in her arms.  They fit a little too well, hugging her frame in a way that left very little to the imagination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you even drink coffee, or do you just come here to look busy?” Rio quipped, her eyes glinting with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was something about the way Rio moved now in those scrubs. Fluid, confident, like she belonged in them more than anyone else in the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, trying her best to stay composed. The way those scrubs fit her, the way her muscles moved effortlessly under the fabric—it should’ve been irrelevant, but Agatha couldn’t help the way her gaze lingered for a second too long before snapping back to her usual sharp, dismissive demeanor</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I come here for coffee, not to be interrogated by you," Agatha said, her voice flat but carrying the bite she always put in it around Rio. “And just so you know I drink coffee just fine, thank you for your concern,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her cup, pretending to focus on it, but the pressure of Rio’s presence, her teasing energy, was like a magnet pulling her attention back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course you do,” Rio said, stepping closer, her smirk deepening. “But let’s be real, coffee’s just a prop, isn’t it? You’re way too controlled for caffeine to actually do anything. This is all part of the act, right? The ice queen routine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned audibly, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Why is it physically impossible for you to take anything seriously? Do you even know how to have a normal conversation, or do you just go around annoying everyone you meet until they give up and leave?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, unbothered. “Annoying you is my favorite pastime, actually. And judging by how much you’re talking, I’d say I’m doing a damn good job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened, and she fought the urge to roll her eyes. "I’m not sure who you think you’re impressing with that smug attitude, but it’s definitely not me," she shot back, her tone sharper than usual. Agatha inhaled sharply and shot Rio a glare. “You don’t know a damn thing about me,” she said, her voice colder than the iced coffee in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I know plenty,” Rio replied, her voice dropping just slightly, like she was letting Agatha in on a secret. “I know you hate being interrupted, but here I am. I know you’d rather be anywhere else right now, and yet, here you are. And I know…” She paused, her eyes raking over Agatha in a way that made her skin heat, “…you can’t stand how much I’m getting under your skin right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “You’re not getting under my skin,” she hissed, though even to her own ears, it sounded unconvincing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, taking another step closer, close enough that Agatha could see the faint hint of freckles across her nose. “Sure I’m not. That’s why you’re gripping that cup like it owes you money. Want me to let you borrow a stress ball?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, her patience wearing dangerously thin. “Do you ever shut up?” she snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not when I’m having this much fun,” Rio replied smoothly. “And right now? I’m having a blast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand twitched like she wanted to throw the coffee at her, but instead, she forced herself to take a slow, deliberate sip. “You must be desperate for entertainment if this counts as fun for you,” she said, her voice cutting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not desperate,” Rio said, her smirk growing impossibly wider. “Just highly motivated. Watching you try not to lose your shit? Highlight of my day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glare could’ve melted steel. “I’m sure that says more about your pathetic existence than it does about me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, tilting her head as though considering. “Maybe. Or maybe it just means you’re the most interesting thing in this place. You should be flattered, really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flattered?” Agatha barked out a humorless laugh. “I’m irritated. There’s a difference, though I doubt you’d understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sure,” Rio said, nodding mock-seriously. “I mean, if I were in your shoes, I’d probably be irritated too. Having to fight this hard to pretend I’m not into someone? Exhausting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw and took a slow sip of her coffee, the bitterness matching her mood. “You might want to stop now before you embarrass yourself further,” she said coolly, though her hand gripped the cup just a little too tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low, amused hum, stepping closer still, now barely an arm’s length away. “Embarrass myself? Sweetheart, I thrive on embarrassment—other people’s, mostly. But if you think you can phase me, by all means, give it a shot”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Ah, so that’s it. You bother me because your life is boring. What a tragic little existence you must lead. I’ll light a candle for you later—if I remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw her head back and laughed, loud enough that several staff members glanced their way, though Rio clearly didn’t care. “Wow, a candle? That’s generous for you. Didn’t think you had a charitable bone in your body. Must be an early Christmas miracle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, her voice rising. “Excuse me?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t worry,” Rio said, her tone practically dripping with fake reassurance. “Your secret’s safe with me. I know admitting things isn’t exactly your strong suit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step forward, her voice low and venomous now. “You are the most insufferable person I have ever met.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you,” Rio said, leaning in just enough to invade her space, her smirk bordering on predatory now, “are the most fun person to mess with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned audibly, pinching the bridge of her nose. “You need a goddamn hobby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laugh was loud and genuine, drawing more attention from the staff around them. “This is my hobby, Harkness. And judging by how riled up you are, I’m really good at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you’ve spent too much time being the center of attention.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me? The center of attention?” Rio laughed, stepping closer again, her teasing nature unrelenting. “Look, Harkness, you’re the one who can’t seem to get enough of me. It’s fine. I don’t mind the attention.” She leaned in, her voice lowering just a little, her words almost a challenge. “But don’t lie to yourself. I know I’m on your mind. I’m </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> on your mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face flushed with frustration, and she couldn’t decide if she wanted to slap Rio or walk away. Instead, she clenched her jaw, trying to keep her cool.  "Nice try, but you’re still the same annoying pain in my ass." she said, but even as she spoke, she could hear the lie in her own voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened, and she crossed her arms, leaning lazily against the counter like she had all the time in the world. “That’s creative. Do you sit at home coming up with these, or do they just pop into your head when you see me? Be honest, I’m flattered either way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared, heat rising to her face. “Believe me, I don’t waste a single thought on you outside of these unfortunate encounters.” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Liar her subconscient said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile was smug, and she raised her eyebrows. “Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, Harkness. ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, Agatha turned and walked away, her pulse racing, her thoughts a tangled mess. She could feel Rio’s eyes on her back, the teasing, relentless energy following her like a shadow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bye, sweetheart!” Rio called after her, her voice laced with mock sweetness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t turn around, but her ears burned as she stormed off, her pulse racing and her thoughts a tangled mess. Behind her, Rio’s laughter echoed like a victory bell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She huffed while she marched out, her appetite evaporating. She retreated to her office, locking the door behind her. Lunch, such as it was, consisted of a granola bar and coffee while she reviewed charts in solitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that afternoon, Agatha headed to the weekly department head meeting. The conference room buzzed with chatter as chairs filled, and Agatha quickly spotted Wanda at a table near the back. She made her way over, grateful for a friendly face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mariah got lucky with a free evening,” Wanda remarked, sipping her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t remind me,” Agatha muttered, glancing around the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha settled into the seat beside Wanda. Her eyes landed on Rio, seated near the middle of the room who was still casually flipping through papers, completely unbothered by the presence of anyone around her. Agatha gritted her teeth, forcing herself to turn away. The last thing she needed was to let Rio's mere existence throw her off again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu finally entered the room, cutting through the chatter like a calm authority. She gave a small nod to the group, her glasses catching the light as she adjusted them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon, everyone,” Dr. Calderu greeted, her voice steady and composed, effortlessly quieting the room. “I trust everyone’s had a productive week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few murmurs of assent filled the air, but Agatha couldn’t help but glance at Rio again. Her posture was relaxed, one arm casually draped over the back of her chair as she gave the impression that nothing could phase her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get down to business,” Dr. Calderu continued, her eyes sweeping over the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the meeting began, Agatha forced her focus onto the agenda, though it was nearly impossible to ignore the occasional glance Rio threw her way, always paired with that infuriating smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t deny the way her body seemed to take notice, the way her eyes lingered on the defined muscles in Rio’s arms as she reached for a file from the nearby shelf. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a strange flutter in her chest, quickly suppressing it with a sharp breath. </span>
<em>
<span>Why do I care?</span>
</em>
<span> she asked herself, trying to dismiss the feeling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like it was anything new. She’d seen plenty of people in scrubs, plenty of doctors, and it wasn’t as if Rio’s presence here had any bearing on her day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head, quickly turning her focus to Dr Calderu, forcing herself to look away from Rio before she could let her thoughts linger too long. </span>
<em>
<span>It’s just the scrubs,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha told herself, but her pulse betrayed her, thrumming a little faster than it should’ve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have other important items on the agenda today. Let's  go over staffing updates. Rio would you be so kind to brief us on any changes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze immediately shifted to Rio as Dr. Calderu motioned toward her. Rio’s lips curled up into a smile, but it wasn’t her usual teasing grin—it was more calculated, like she knew exactly how everyone was watching. She lifted a hand slightly, acknowledging the request.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, Lilia” Rio replied smoothly, her tone confident and casual, as always. “We’re a bit short this week, but we’ve got things under control. I’ll make sure we don’t miss a beat, as usual.” She glanced briefly toward Agatha, the glint in her eye unmistakable. “I'll keep ortho running like a well-oiled machine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t respond. She knew Rio liked the attention, loved playing the role of the cool, collected one, and Agatha wasn’t about to give her the satisfaction of reacting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu cleared her throat, pulling the group’s attention back to him. “Thanks Rio. Now, let’s move on to the patient care reports. I’ll hand it over to Agatha”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tensed as she was called on. She straightened in her seat, gathering her thoughts quickly before she spoke, forcing her focus back to the task at hand. "We’ve had a busy week in the maternity ward, but everything’s under control. We’ve seen a spike in high-risk pregnancies, so we're closely monitoring those cases. I’ve been overseeing a few potential complications, but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice was sharp and direct, cutting through the tension in the room as she scanned her notes. She could feel Rio’s eyes on her again, but this time, Agatha didn’t let it distract her. Not now, not here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good work, Harkness,” Dr. Calderu nodded, giving her a small but genuine compliment. “Now, onto surgical outcomes. Dr. Hunt, if you can provide an update?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Dr. Calderu continued leading the meeting, Agatha’s attention began to wane, the rhythm of the discussions blending into a dull hum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed quietly in her pocket. Agatha glanced down, her heart skipping a beat when she saw the name on the screen—Daniel.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hello Agatha. Nice to hear. I'll be there. Call me tonight so we can arrange the details.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The words were simple, yet they hit her like a sudden, unexpected wave. Her chest tightened, a mix of longing and confusion swirling within her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Will do </span>
</em>
<span>she typed and pushed the phone back into her pocket, her fingers brushing the screen with a slight tremor. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh god.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed a drink. Going out with Mariah and the highlighter haired doctor started to look more appealing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice of Dr. Calderu snapped her back into the present. "Agatha?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked, looking up in confusion. Wanda's hand was lightly resting on her arm. Agatha’s mind scrambled to catch up with the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah” Agatha said quickly, trying to shake off the weight of the moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Calderu nodded, her expression neutral. "Alright, great to hear it's settled then." She said with a smile and then moved on, seamlessly shifting to the next topic in the meeting, and Agatha sat there, still trying to piece together what the hell had just happened. </span>
<em>
<span>What did I just agree to?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced over at Wanda, who was holding back a laugh, her lips twitching with amusement. Agatha narrowed her eyes, leaning in slightly. "What the hell did I just agree to?" she whispered, barely containing her frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s smile widened. "Trauma certification for the first-year residents," she said, her tone a mix of sympathy and amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her stomach drop. "Trauma certification? For the first-year residents?" she repeated, as if saying it aloud would somehow make it more logical. “Fuck”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel her pulse quicken, the heat of frustration creeping up her neck. Her brain was a jumbled mess, processing the words from earlier, trying to put the pieces together. And then, of course, the message from Daniel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth. She didn’t even realize she was clenching her jaw until it hurt. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh god,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought, fuming inside. She could feel the anger bubbling up—anger at herself, at the chaos of the meeting, and especially at Daniel for throwing her off course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was his fault. All of it. If he hadn't texted her, if she hadn’t been so damn distracted by the message, she wouldn’t have been caught off guard in the meeting, agreeing to whatever this trauma certification thing was. She didn’t need this right now. Not with everything else on her plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice broke through her seething thoughts. "You good, Agatha?" she asked, her tone teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a tight smile. "Yeah," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "Never been better" Her sarcasm was thick, but Wanda didn’t seem to mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned back in her chair, her expression almost too casual. "You’ll do great," she said with a sly grin. "And don’t worry. At least you won't have to do it alone. You and Rio will do well together."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. "Wait, what?" she sputtered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She volunteered before Lilia asked you” Wanda said oblivious to the turmoil that was growing inside of agatha. "You two will do fine. No need to worry about it. You’re both capable, and it’ll give you a chance to work closely together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a wave of dread wash over her. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, she was fucked.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind raced, the words feeling like they were being absorbed through a fog. </span>
<em>
<span>Rio volunteered?</span>
</em>
<span> The realization hit her like a punch to the gut, making her momentarily dizzy. How in the world had this become her reality? She could feel the heat rising in her chest, her frustration mounting as everything started to crash down on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Again. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The idea of being paired with her for something as intense as trauma certification sent a jolt of annoyance through Agatha, tightening her shoulders and making her fists clench under the table.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She volunteered. </span>
</em>
<span>Why would anyone willingly volunteer to teach those hopelessly incompetent first-year residents? Agatha’s mind churned with disbelief, the pieces not fitting into place. The chaos of the meeting, Daniel’s text, and now this—</span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>—this couldn’t be happening. She didn’t want to be anywhere near Rio, especially in such a professional capacity. And yet, now she was stuck with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened as she forced herself to focus on whatever Lilia was saying, but her brain was still screaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glared across the room and her heart skipped a beat as, for the first time since she’d agreed to this nonsense, Rio caught her eye. The instant their gazes locked, Agatha’s breath caught in her chest. Rio’s eyes sparkled with a hint of amusement, and that infuriatingly confident smirk stretched across her lips. The kind of smirk that was equal parts arrogant and playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them seemed to crackle with some invisible tension, and Agatha could feel her pulse quicken. Her stomach churned as the weight of it all sank in. This was going to be a nightmare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look away, not for a second, and Agatha felt the heat rush to her face. Her mind screamed at her to look away, to focus on the meeting, but she was paralyzed. All the anger she’d been trying to tamp down flared again, this time with an undercurrent of something else she refused to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes were still on her, the amusement clear in them. It was like she could sense the discomfort, the annoyance, and she was soaking it all in, savoring it. Agatha had half a mind to glare back, but the last thing she needed was to make this worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to look away, her irritation growing by the second. The universe was laughing at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She definitely needed a drink now. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Or ten.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha wasted no time leaving the meeting, her shoes clicking sharply against the sterile tile floor in a staccato rhythm that echoed her mounting frustration. The cold evening air hit her face as she stepped outside, sharp and biting, but it didn’t do much to calm the storm brewing inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached her car, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She froze for a moment, the vibration against her hip pulling her attention from her swirling thoughts. Fishing it out with one hand, she glanced at the screen, and her stomach churned.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Daniel.</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>His name alone was enough to sour her mood further. She hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. A part of her wanted to let it ring out, to pretend she hadn’t seen it, but another part knew better. Ignoring him would only give him an excuse to weasel his way back into her day later. With a resigned breath, she swiped to answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daniel,” she said, her tone clipped and cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” came his reply, smooth as ever, laced with that infuriating combination of charm and smug entitlement that used to catch her off guard—but not anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to confirm,” he continued, his words slow, deliberate. “I’ll be there for Nicky’s birthday next Saturday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened. Her knuckles turned white as she fought to keep her voice level. “Fine,” she said curtly, her words measured, controlled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t done. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staying in a hotel,” she added, her voice dropping an octave into a sharper, more dangerous tone. “And Daniel...” She let the pause stretch just long enough for him to feel the weight of what she was about to say. “You’re not bringing her. I won’t have Vanessa here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence on the other end was deafening. She could practically hear him grinding his teeth, his fragile ego bristling at her defiance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, that’s” he started, his voice tinged with indignation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Her voice cut through his like a blade, sharp and unyielding. “This is about Nicky. It’s not about me, its not you, and it’s definitely not about your fucking little mistress.” She spat the last word like venom, her chest tightening as the anger bubbled to the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause. This one was longer, heavier, filled with the weight of things left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he said finally, his voice tight and clipped. The charm was gone now, replaced with a sharp edge that hinted at his own frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she snapped, not giving him the satisfaction of softening her tone. Without waiting for a response, she ended the call and shoved the phone back into her pocket with a force that made her hand sting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaning against the car, she closed her eyes and exhaled sharply, her breath forming a visible cloud in the cold air. Her fingers were trembling, not from the chill but from the residual adrenaline coursing through her veins. She pressed her palm to her forehead, trying to massage away the pounding headache that was beginning to form.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her anger swirled, sharp and raw, but beneath it was a familiar ache—a gnawing resentment and a weariness that came from years of dealing with Daniel’s selfishness. How dare he? How dare he try to talk to her as if everything was fine, as if he hadn’t shattered their family and walked away without looking back? And Vanessa. Just the thought of her name sent a fresh wave of bitterness coursing through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vanessa had been the final blow, the wrecking ball to their already faltering marriage who turned into ash. And yet, Daniel still had the audacity to think he could parade her around like some prize, that she’d tolerate having that woman near her son’s birthday. Not a chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands curled into fists at her sides, the sharp bite of her nails digging into her palms grounding her slightly. She needed to calm down, to focus, but her emotions felt like a runaway train—wild, uncontrollable. Her chest rose and fell in uneven breaths as she tried to shake off the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it wasn’t just anger. Beneath the fury was something she didn’t want to admit—hurt. Hurt that Daniel’s betrayal had left a scar she couldn’t seem to cover, no matter how much time passed. Hurt that she still had to deal with him at all, tethered together by the one good thing that had come from their marriage: Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes and stared out at the dark parking lot, the cold air prickling her skin. She needed to get home. Nicky would be waiting for her, and she couldn’t afford to let Daniel’s nonsense seep into her time with him. He deserved better than that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed again, jolting her out of her thoughts. She fished it out and glanced at the screen: an incoming call from the person she wanted to see the least right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach flipped, but she quickly hit the button to silence the notification. Whatever Rio wanted, it could wait. She knew they needed to talk to plan out the trauma certification but she wasn’t in the mood to deal with her enigmatic colleague or whatever drama she might be carrying along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding into the driver’s seat, Agatha gripped the wheel tightly, her knuckles still white. She let out another sharp breath and started the car. The engine roared to life, filling the silence with a low hum. She wasn’t just driving away from the parking lot; she was leaving behind the lingering weight of that phone call and the infuriating meeting, determined not to let it ruin the rest of her night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally got home, the familiar creak of the front door greeted her like an old companion. The warmth of the house wrapped around her, softening the edges of her frayed nerves—though only slightly. She shrugged off her coat, letting it fall onto the nearest chair, and kicked off her shoes with a small sigh of relief. The tension from the meeting, the call with Daniel, and the lingering frustration from the day still sat heavy in her chest, but the cozy glow of the living room offered some reprieve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was there, sitting cross-legged on the floor with his building blocks scattered in a chaotic sprawl around him. His brow was furrowed in concentration as he carefully balanced a bright red block on top of his growing tower. Agatha stopped in the doorway, watching him for a moment, her heart softening at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, buddy,” she said, stepping into the room and ruffling his messy hair as she passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Mama,” he chirped back, his voice light and carefree, though his eyes never left his masterpiece. The sound of his happiness loosened something tight inside her. No matter how turbulent her day had been, Nicky’s simple presence always reminded her of what truly mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crouched down beside him, studying his construction. “What’s this? A castle?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky shook his head, a small, proud smile tugging at his lips. “No, it’s a space station.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A space station, huh? Looks pretty advanced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is,” he said with the kind of certainty only a child could have. “It’s for the astronauts and aliens to live together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I think the aliens are lucky to have you as their architect,” she said, kissing the top of his head. His giggle followed her as she straightened up and headed upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once in her bedroom, the weight of the day came crashing back down. She pulled her phone out of her pocket, intending to set it aside and disconnect for a while, but the screen lit up with a series of missed call notifications. Her stomach twisted when she saw the name staring back at her again: </span>
<b>Rio.</b>
</p><p>
<span>The sight of it made her pause. Four missed calls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, seeing them, her pulse quickened with an unwelcome mix of emotions she couldn’t—or wouldn’t—name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not tonight. She didn’t have the energy to untangle whatever fresh complication Rio was offering. Whatever she wanted would have to wait until monday.  Swiping the notifications away with a flick of her thumb, Agatha tossed her phone onto the bed with more force than necessary. It landed with a soft thud against the comforter, and she pressed her hands to her temples, willing the day to stop spinning in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What she needed the most right now was a drink. A strong one. Something to quiet the incessant buzz of frustration and uncertainty in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without giving herself time to second-guess, she snatched up her phone again and scrolled through her contacts. When she found Mariah’s name, she hit the call button and pressed the phone to her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah answered on the first ring, her voice bright and teasing. “Agatha! To what do I owe the pleasure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mentioned a bar?” Agatha said, her voice still sharp around the edges. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah laughed softly. “You’re in, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need a drink,” Agatha said bluntly, skipping any preamble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah laughed, the sound warm and familiar. “Oh, honey, you must be psychic because I was just about to call you. A few of us are hitting that new bar downtown tonight. Perfect timing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m in,” Agatha confirmed, exhaling heavily. “Just tell me where and when.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah hesitated for a second. “Don’t worry—I’m not dragging you to some dive. We’ll have fun”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, her instincts kicking in. Mariah’s tone carried a familiar mischievous edge. She knew her friend well enough to catch it. “Who’s coming?” she asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll see when you get there,” Mariah replied, her voice lilting with amusement. “Don’t worry about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach tightened at the lack of specifics, her thoughts immediately jumping to Rio,  but she shoved them aside. She almost pressed further, but she stopped herself, unwilling to give Mariah any ammunition to tease her with. The last thing she needed was for Mariah to pick up on how much she was overthinking this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Agatha said finally, her voice even. “I’m in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good girl,” Mariah said, and Agatha could practically hear the grin in her voice. “Nine o’clock. I'll text you the details. Don’t be late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha muttered before hanging up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the phone down and exhaled slowly, staring at the ceiling. The idea of going out didn’t exactly fill her with excitement, but staying in with her swirling thoughts felt unbearable. She needed a distraction—anything to pull her out of the rut she’d been stuck in all day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Downstairs, Nicky was still engrossed in his space station, his blocks now forming a sprawling, colorful base. Agatha watched him for a moment before calling over, “Time to get ready for bed, buddy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aww,” Nicky groaned but didn’t argue. He began carefully dismantling his creation, mumbling about how he’d rebuild it even bigger tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After tucking him into bed and reading a chapter from his favorite book, she kissed his forehead and lingered in the doorway, watching as his eyes fluttered shut. Her heart squeezed, a familiar ache blooming in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Quietly closing his door, Agatha pulled out her phone again and calledone of Nicky’s babysitters, quickly arranging for someone to come over for the evening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight wasn’t about overthinking or reliving the mess Daniel had left behind. Tonight, it was about escape—even if just for a little while. Whatever tonight had in store, she wasn’t sure she was ready for it. But she’d face it anyway—with a stiff drink in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in front of her closet, arms crossed, her lips pressed into a thin line. Rows of neatly hung clothes stared back at her, mostly neutral tones and practical cuts—her usual uniform for blending in rather than standing out. Normally, she would reach for her go-to black turtleneck and jeans, a look that said, “I’m here, but I’m not making an effort.” But tonight, something stopped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it was Mariah’s teasing tone on the phone, or the residual frustration still simmering in her chest from the day, but Agatha felt an urge to step out of her comfort zone. Just a little. Nothing drastic, she told herself, scanning the hangers with a more discerning eye. Her fingers hovered over a soft, tight-fitting black long-sleeve she hadn’t worn in ages. The fabric clung to her curves in a way that always made her feel simultaneously powerful and exposed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled it out and held it against her body in the mirror, tilting her head as she considered it. “Why not?” she muttered, tossing it onto the bed. Next came the question of what to pair it with. After a moment’s hesitation, she grabbed a sleek leather skirt—knee-length but fitted, with a subtle slit up the side. It wasn’t something she wore often, but tonight it felt right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slipped into the outfit, smoothing the fabric over her hips as she turned to examine herself in the mirror. The woman staring back at her looked...different. A little bolder, a little sharper. She wasn’t sure if she liked it, but she didn’t hate it either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now for the finishing touches. High heels. The thought made her wince, and she almost reached for the black stilettos on the front of her closet. But then she remembered the boots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat had gifted them to her for her 40th birthday, insisting they were “sexy as fuck” Agatha had laughed at the time, but the boots had remained unworn, tucked away in their pristine box, waiting for the right occasion. Tonight felt like the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked faintly and reached for the black leather ankle boots with sharp, sleek heels. The polished leather gleamed under the dim light as she slipped them on, the fit snug and perfect. She stood carefully, wobbling for just a second before straightening up, the extra height making her feel bold and commanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her reflection gained a few inches of confidence, the boots adding a sultry edge to her look. They were bold, attention-grabbing—and exactly what she needed tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For her makeup, she kept things simple but deliberate—a touch of eyeliner, a sweep of mascara, and then, for the final flourish, she reached for a bold red lipstick. The tube felt foreign in her hand, almost like a weapon. She hesitated before leaning closer to the mirror and applying it with slow precision. The color transformed her face, making her blue eyes stand out and her lips impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she let her hair down, the dark waves cascading over her shoulders. She ran her fingers through it, fluffing it out just enough to give it some volume. When she stepped back to take in the full effect, she barely recognized herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Agatha in the mirror looked like someone who had her shit together, someone who didn’t take nonsense from anyone. But more than that, she looked sexy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That realization made her pause. Sexy wasn’t something she often felt—commanding, yes, powerful, always—but sexy? That was a rarer sensation, one she hadn’t fully embraced more than a handful of times in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she stood there, staring at her reflection as if trying to reconcile this version of herself with the one she was used to. A slow, wry smile curved her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe I should channel her for the night,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she arrived at the bar, the night was in full swing. Music pulsed through the air, a low, steady beat that thrummed in her chest as she stepped inside. The place was dimly lit, with a sleek, modern aesthetic—exposed brick walls, warm golden lights, and a long, polished bar lined with stools. Groups of people clustered around high tables, their laughter and conversation blending into the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spotted Mariah near the back, waving enthusiastically. Her friend was surrounded by a small group of people, some familiar faces, others not. Agatha’s heart gave a nervous flutter as she scanned the group, but there was no immediate sign of Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look at you!” Mariah exclaimed as Agatha approached. Her eyes swept over Agatha’s outfit with open admiration. “Hot damn, Harkness. You clean up well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though a small smile tugged at her lips. “Don’t make it a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it’s already a thing,” Mariah said with a grin, sliding a drink across the table. “Here. You’re going to need this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took the glass, the coolness grounding her as she glanced around the room. The tension in her shoulders began to ease. For now, the night felt manageable. She sipped her drink, letting the warmth spread through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was time to let go—at least a little—and see where the night would take her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had barely finished her drink when she spotted her first red flag of the evening: Nurse Kale. The bright-eyed, overly chipper nurse was perched at the end of the group, her laughter rising above the din of the bar like an obnoxious birdcall. Agatha froze mid-sip, her lips hovering over the rim of her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck is she doing here?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Nurse Kale noticed her at the same moment and beamed. “Dr. Harkness! Fancy seeing you here!” she chirped, waving like they were old friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach sank. </span>
<em>
<span>Of all the gin joints in all the world…</span>
</em>
<span> She forced a tight smile and gave a half-hearted wave, but there was no escape. Mariah was already pulling her toward the group, oblivious to the silent prayers Agatha was sending to every deity to intervene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t expect to see you out of scrubs,” Nurse Kale said brightly, her gaze sweeping over Agatha’s outfit. “And that outfit is to die for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, thanks,” Agatha replied, her tone as flat as her drink suddenly felt. A nurse calling her outfit “to die for” felt like some kind of cosmic joke. She shot Mariah a glare that said, </span>
<em>
<span>Explain. Now.</span>
</em>
<span> But Mariah only smirked, sipping her cocktail with infuriating calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, do you remember Alice?” Mariah said, nudging the woman seated next to Nurse Kale. Alice, with her shock of neon-orange hair and ripped leather jacket, turned and gave Agatha a cheeky grin. “She’s Jen’s girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Girlfriend.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, the pieces clicking into place like a too-loud puzzle. Her gaze darted from Kale—Jen, apparently—who was positively glowing, to Alice, who looked like she’d stepped out of a punk rock music video. Kale... and Alice?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bit the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing. Of course. The bubbly pink ray of sunshine and the walking highlighter. </span>
<em>
<span>Opposites attract, right?</span>
</em>
<span> She glanced at Mariah, who was suddenly very interested in her drink, and thought, </span>
<em>
<span>You planned this, didn’t you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“So... you’re dating Nurse Kale,” Agatha said, tilting her head toward Alice. Her voice dripped with disbelief as she motioned vaguely toward Jen. “This Kale?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice chuckled, clearly unfazed by Agatha’s tone, her grin as sharp as her eyeliner. “It’s just Jen outside the hospital,” she corrected, slinging an arm around Kale’s shoulders like she was claiming a prize. “And yup. She’s mine.” Her eyes sparkled mischievously. “Why? Are you jealous, Doctor Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, taken aback. Jealous? Of Kale? Seriously? She almost choked on her drink but managed to keep her expression neutral. Barely. “Hardly,” she said flatly. “Just... surprised.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s smirk widened, and Agatha couldn’t decide what irritated her more—the smugness radiating off the happy couple or the fact that she was stuck here witnessing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kale—or Jen—leaned into Alice, her eyes shining with that annoying, sickeningly sweet adoration that made Agatha want to roll her eyes hard enough to see her brain. “She’s the best, isn’t she?” Jen said, her voice dripping with pure affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her drink hovering near her lips. “Sure,” she said slowly, the words dragged out like they physically pained her. “Let’s... go with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice burst out laughing, and Jen giggled like they were sharing an inside joke Agatha wanted no part of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifted her weight, the heels she’d dared to wear suddenly feeling like a terrible idea. Her patience was wearing thin. The bar was too loud, the lights too dim, and the last thing she wanted was to be stuck in this sitcom-worthy meet-cute scenario. </span>
<em>
<span>I came for drinks and distraction, not this.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, clearing her throat and setting her glass down harder than she intended. “How long have you two been together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, just a couple of months,” Alice said, her grin growing impossibly wider. “Met Jen when I covered a shift at Mayo. Instant connection.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha side-eyed Jen, whose cheeks flushed as she nodded eagerly. “It was kind of romantic,” Jen added, twirling a strand of her hair between her fingers. “You don’t always meet people who get you, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to groan. “Mmhmm,” she murmured, draining her glass in one long sip. Her mind screamed for an escape route, but none presented itself. She glanced at Mariah, hoping for rescue, but Mariah’s smirk made it clear she was enjoying every second of Agatha’s discomfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, the conversation shifted to work soon enough, and Agatha found herself reluctantly pulled in. Jen started recounting the last chaotic shift in the ER, her eyes lighting up as she talked about the series of mishaps—a misplaced bedpan, a patient who insisted on wearing his Crocs through surgery, and a near disaster involving a confused intern and a broken IV pump. Alice chimed in occasionally, clearly enjoying the behind-the-scenes gossip and laughing at all the ridiculousness of their day-to-day life in the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By the way,” Agatha said, setting her glass down after an absurd story involving a bedpan and a very unfortunate janitor. She wiped her mouth and raised an eyebrow, her curiosity finally getting the better of her. “Where’s Wanda? I figured she’d be here, dragging me into tequila shots or something equally catastrophic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen exchanged a glance with Alice before smirking.  "Oh, Wanda?" she said, raising an eyebrow. "She’s not coming tonight. She and Vision are having a date night."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s ears perked up. “A date night?” she repeated, leaning in slightly. “Without the kids? That’s... I mean, good for her,” she added, though the words tasted faintly bitter. There was a sharp twinge of envy that crept in, something Agatha wasn’t proud of.  A night with no kids and a partner who wasn’t a walking disaster? That sounded practically mythical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Alice said, her grin widening. “They even booked a sitter. Vision’s cooking her dinner tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vision? Cooking?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “What’s on the menu? A candlelit bowl of microchips?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah snorted into her drink, and Alice chuckled, but Jen crossed her arms with a mock-serious expression. “Don’t underestimate Vision,” she said, smirking. “He’s got serious skills in the kitchen. His quinoa salad is life-changing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, the corner of her lips curling into a half-smile. "Quinoa salad?" she repeated, feigning horror. “What’s next—romantic readings from </span>
<em>
<span>Better Homes and Gardens</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice elbowed Jen, laughing. “You see? This is why Wanda needs to be here. She’d be throwing back shots to drown out all this quinoa talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She would,” Agatha muttered under her breath, though she couldn't help but chuckle at the thought.   “And she’d have the entire bar doing them too.” For a moment, the memory of Wanda’s chaotic energy tugged at her, and she couldn’t help but smile. Wanda always did know how to make everything a little more... lively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned in, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “You should be happy for Wanda,” she said, her voice laced with amusement.  “She’s got it all figured out—date night without the kids. Hell, she’s probably getting laid right now. Something we can all aspire to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice exchanged looks, and for a moment, Agatha felt a twinge of discomfort. It wasn’t that she wasn’t happy for Wanda—hell, part of her genuinely was—but she’d never been great at being self-aware when it came to her own life. The idea of a peaceful, uncomplicated night felt like an alien concept, and that pang of envy only seemed to grow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, trying to push it down. “Yeah, good for her,” she said, a little too dryly. "The rest of us are over here, getting our life advice from a woman who thinks quinoa salads are a good time."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice laughed, the sound a bit too loud for Agatha’s liking, but it wasn’t unkind. "You’re just mad you don’t have a date night to look forward to," she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flickered over to Mariah, who was smiling knowingly.  “Oh, I’ve got plenty to look forward to,” she said, her tone airy but sharp. “Like figuring out what drink I’m on and wondering if my boots will kill me before the night is over.” She wasn’t about to reveal too much. Not tonight. Or ever if it was up to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen, sensing the shift, chimed in with a grin. “At least the tequila shots will come later. Whether we’re celebrating or drowning our sorrows, they’ll do the job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her tension easing just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If Wanda were here, we'd have the whole bar's worth of tequila in front of us by now," Mariah said, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, her tension easing slightly. "This night’s not terrible, but I’m starting to wonder if I need to plan my own escape," she added, glancing at her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kale grinned. “It’s not that bad, is it? You just need a few more drinks. And maybe your own date night. What are you, forty-something? Prime time, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened slightly at the jab, but she quickly regained her composure, her lips twitching. “And you’re what? Thirty-something? Prime time for bad decisions and realizing you can’t metabolize tequila like you used to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group burst into laughter, and even Agatha couldn’t help but crack a genuine smile. For now, the tension dissolved, leaving her with the faintest flicker of hope that the night wouldn’t be a total disaster. Then again, it was still early.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she knew better than to expect things to stay calm for long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation carried on, the drinks flowing freely as the night stretched on. Agatha found herself loosening up, despite the strange tension between her and her colleagues. Jen was loudly recounting a particularly ridiculous incident involving a forgotten patient chart, while Alice and Kale laughed along. Mariah was just tipsy enough to start making her usual playful comments, and Agatha couldn't help but appreciate the diversion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then, just like clockwork, Rio appeared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She strutted into the bar, late as always, her entrance somehow commanding without even trying. Agatha’s eyes locked onto her immediately, drawn in as if by some magnetic force she couldn’t shake. Rio was wearing her usual uniform of careless rebellion—well-worn Doc Martens, a black Metallica shirt so faded it looked vintage, and impossibly tight black jeans that highlighted every lean curve. Her wavy hair framed her face in an artful mess, and her smoky eye makeup had just the right amount of smudge to suggest she didn’t care, even though it was obvious she did. Everything about her screamed defiance. She was effortlessly cool, the kind of person who didn’t even need to try.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach tightened, a mix of irritation and something she didn’t care to name bubbling up inside her. How did Rio always manage to look so effortlessly... </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span>? She was defiance personified, a walking declaration of “screw the world”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched as Rio scanned the room with that practiced air of disinterest. For a split second, Agatha braced herself, convinced Rio’s eyes would land on hers, that there would be some acknowledgment—a nod, a smirk, something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s gaze flickered right past her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her breath catching in her throat. It was as if she didn’t exist. Her jaw tightened instinctively, the rejection landing harder than she expected. She felt a strange, sharp pang in her chest, something uncomfortably close to hurt. The heat of it crept up her neck, threatening to color her cheeks, and she hated how visible her emotions always seemed to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t believe Rio was ignoring her so blatantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, what was that?” Mariah whispered, nudging Agatha sharply in the ribs. Her voice was dripping with intrigue, her eyes practically sparkling as she followed Agatha’s line of sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha muttered, her tone clipped and dismissive. She tore her eyes away from Rio, glaring at the rim of her glass instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That didn’t look like nothing,” Mariah pressed, leaning in closer. Her grin was insufferable, and it made Agatha want to throw her drink at her—though, realistically, she’d just order another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care,” Agatha said, more forcefully this time, though even to her own ears, it sounded laughably unconvincing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah snickered, clearly delighted by the reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen, ever the observant one, glanced between the two of them, her brow arching slightly. “Didn’t know Rio was such a sore subject,” she remarked dryly, taking a sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth opened to snap back, but she caught herself, unwilling to give anyone the satisfaction. She clenched her jaw instead, swallowing the retort along with the lump forming in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes betrayed her, darting back to Rio against her will. Rio was now leaning casually against the bar, her posture the perfect blend of laziness and poise. She was talking to someone—Agatha couldn’t remember their name, didn’t care to, really—but the easy way Rio tilted her head and let out a low chuckle made her stomach churn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, Rio didn’t even glance her way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tightened her grip on her glass, the condensation slipping against her fingers. A small, ridiculous part of her wanted to storm over there and demand acknowledgment, to disrupt Rio’s infuriating indifference and remind her she existed. But she didn’t. She knew better. Any attempt to confront Rio would only backfire spectacularly. She’d end up looking desperate—</span>
<em>
<span>weak</span>
</em>
<span>—and she refused to give Rio the satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she swallowed hard and turned back to Mariah and Jen, forcing her expression into something resembling indifference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re awfully quiet,” Mariah said, her voice light but probing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just... observing,” Agatha replied, lifting her drink and taking a longer sip than necessary. The alcohol burned its way down her throat, grounding her momentarily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In truth, she felt like she was unraveling. There was an ache beneath her skin, an irritation she couldn’t quite place. She told herself it wasn’t Rio. It couldn’t be. Sure, Rio had ignored her, but why should that matter? She wasn’t the type to care about such things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except, apparently, she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laughter carried across the room, low and warm, and Agatha’s ears burned with the sound. She didn’t realize she was glaring until Jen raised an eyebrow at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, Agatha, what’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” she snapped, too quickly. Her voice had an edge now, sharper than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned back, clearly enjoying herself. “Oh, it’s definitely something. Did Rio do something to you? Say something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, setting her drink down with a soft </span>
<em>
<span>thud</span>
</em>
<span>. “Not everything has to be about her” she said flatly, though her tone lacked its usual conviction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen smirked knowingly, and Mariah shook her head with a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her, reaching for her drink again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if on cue, a bartender appeared with a drink in hand, placing it in front of Agatha. She blinked, momentarily startled, and glanced up. The bartender, a wiry young man with a cheeky grin, nodded toward the other side of the bar, where a man was leaning casually against the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He sent this over,” the bartender said with a wink, his tone conspiratorial. “Said he’d like to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the drink—a deep amber cocktail garnished with a twist of lime. It looked expensive, deliberate, and completely out of place in the chaotic clutter of the bar. Her eyes flicked toward the man, who was grinning at her like he’d just pulled off some grand romantic gesture. He was tall, dressed in business-casual attire, and radiated a kind of forced confidence that immediately set her on edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah, of course, was the first to break the silence. “Oh, this is golden,” she crowed, leaning in with a wide grin. “Agatha Harkness, you’ve still got it! Look at him—sending drinks your way like you’re a movie star or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s eyes sparkled with mischief as she set her own drink down with a decisive clink. “Oh, this is happening. You’re going to talk to him, right?” she said, practically bouncing in her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, groaning. “Not happening,” she muttered, her tone dry. “I’m not interested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not interested?” Jen pressed, feigning shock. “Why not? He’s good-looking, clearly interested, and gasp—a man! That’s your type, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her jaw tightening as she shot Jen a glare. “What’s that supposed to mean?” she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah, sensing the sudden shift in tone, looked between them with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. “Oh, now this is getting interesting,” she said, grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen smirked, clearly enjoying herself. “I’m just saying,” she teased, raising her hands in mock innocence. “You’re hot, and single and you’re not exactly swooning over Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome over there. So, maybe you’ve got a different preference? You know, maybe you’re into girls?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed with heat, and her hand tightened around the glass. “Oh, for God’s sake” she snapped. “I’m straight. Always have been, always will be. Just because I don’t want to fawn over some random guy doesn’t mean—ugh, just drop it, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raised an eyebrow, clearly unfazed by Agatha’s defensive tone. “Alright, alright,” she said, holding up her hands again. “No need to bite my head off. But seriously, Agatha, if you’re not interested in him, what’s the deal? Too busy being mysterious and brooding for a little harmless flirting?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah chimed in with a grin. “Or is it because you’re secretly holding out for someone else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her. “Don’t start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah smirked, unbothered. “Just saying. You’ve been in a mood all night, and now you’ve got a perfectly good drink and a guy who’s clearly into you. What’s stopping you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to retort but found her eyes drifting, almost involuntarily, toward Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there she was, standing across the room, mid-conversation with someone Agatha didn’t recognize. But her attention wasn’t on the conversation. It was on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze was smoldering, sharp and unrelenting. It pinned Agatha in place, made her heart race in a way that infuriated her. The look wasn’t friendly. It was possessive, territorial—like Rio was daring her to do something about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes were locked onto her with an intensity that made Agatha feel like she was being pierced with a thousand daggers. The smoldering look was sharp, uncomfortable. Rio was clearly pissed off, and it only made Agatha’s annoyance grow. Agatha’s lips pressed into a tight line, her irritation flaring. She couldn’t believe she was letting Rio get under her skin like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll tell you what’s stopping me,” she said suddenly, her voice light but laced with a dangerous edge. She grabbed the drink the man had sent over, feeling the chill of the glass seep into her hand. “Absolutely nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen gasped dramatically, clapping her hands. “Oh, here we go!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned forward, her grin widening. “This is a historic moment. Someone alert the media.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored them, standing abruptly. The heels of her boots clicked against the floor as she turned toward the man. The noise felt louder than it should have, punctuating the shift in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, she could feel Rio’s eyes burning into the back of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her. She didn’t have to. She could feel the weight of that gaze, the heat of it spurring her on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t about the man, not really. It was about proving a point—to Rio, to Jen, to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She approached the man slowly, deliberately, her steps measured. Each click of her heels felt like a declaration, each step an answer to the unspoken challenge hanging in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she reached the man, his smile widened, a little too eager, a little too polished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey there,”  he said, his voice warm but entirely forgettable. “I wasn’t sure if you’d come over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, leaning casually against the bar. She raised the glass he’d sent her, swirling the amber liquid inside. “Well,” she said, her tone cool and cutting, “you’ve got my attention—for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, she could feel Rio’s gaze intensify, a storm brewing in silence. The satisfaction was fleeting but sharp, like the edge of a blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm Stephen by the way,” he added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a long sip of her drink, eyeing him carefully. “Thanks, Stephen” she said, her tone a little colder than she intended. “But I’m not really interested in... whatever this is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He raised an eyebrow but smiled anyway, the rejection seemingly rolling off him with ease. “Fair enough. Just thought I’d give it a shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave him a polite smile, but the weight of Rio’s glare was becoming unbearable. It prickled at the back of her neck like static electricity, and her cheeks flushed with the sheer intensity of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension in the air was thick, almost stifling, but the longer she thought about it, the more the idea of pushing Rio’s buttons appealed to her. If Rio wanted to glare daggers, Agatha was happy to hand her the blade. Her pulse quickened, a mix of annoyance and exhilaration thrumming through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually,” Agatha said, a sly smile curling at the corners of her mouth, “maybe I’ll take you up on another drink after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen’s eyes lit up with pleasant surprise, and a broad grin stretched across his face. “I’m glad to hear that.” He leaned in slightly, and Agatha caught a hint of his cologne—woodsy and warm, with an edge of spice. It was a far cry from the chaos of the bar, and she found it oddly grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He gestured toward the bartender, signaling for another round. As the second drink was placed in front of her, he asked, “So, what’s a woman like you doing in a place like this? Something tells me you’re not here for the karaoke.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, surprising even herself. “Oh, you’d be surprised,” she said, her tone light, teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He laughed, his head tipping back slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, leaning in just a fraction, “what brings you here tonight? Looking to score points with a lonely drinker, or is this just your usual routine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen grinned, his eyes bright with amusement. “Honestly? I came out with some coworkers, but they’re all married and boring. Saw you across the room and figured, why not? Life’s too short not to take a chance, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow, swirling the new drink in her hand. “A bold move. Most people would’ve settled for a smile from across the room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” he said, leaning closer, his voice dropping slightly, “a smile wouldn’t have done you justice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed, a genuine sound that startled her for a moment. “Careful, Stephen. Lay it on too thick, and I might start thinking you’re a serial flirt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only on special occasions,” he replied smoothly, a playful twinkle in his eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha let herself relax. Stephen was easy to talk to—handsome, confident but not overly cocky, and quick with a joke. It felt... nice. The kind of nice that didn’t demand anything from her, didn’t weigh her down with complications or unresolved tensions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” he said, leaning his elbow on the bar as if settling in for a longer conversation, “what’s your story? You’ve got that look—you know, like there’s a novel’s worth of secrets hidden behind those eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “A novelist? That’s a new one. Usually, people just go with ‘mysterious.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen laughed again, shaking his head. “Guilty as charged. But seriously, what’s your name? Or do I have to guess?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated for a split second, then offered a small smile. “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” he repeated, as if testing the weight of her name. “I like it. Unique, strong... suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this where you start guessing my star sign?” she quipped, her smirk returning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if it’s a dealbreaker,” he shot back with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she spoke to him, her focus shifted away from Rio and the tension she had been feeling, and for the first time in hours, Agatha found herself genuinely enjoying the conversation. They talked about everything and nothing at all—work, life and random things that came to mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She even laughed—a real, unguarded laugh that felt foreign but welcome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time all day, she felt her shoulders relax, the weight of everything—Rio’s glare, her own frustrations—fading into the background. He wasn’t perfect, but he was... uncomplicated. Easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Stephen leaned closer, his voice almost playful. “Have you ever played pool?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Never. I’m not much for games.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen grinned, his teeth white against his tan. “I think you’d be great at it. Let me show you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could protest, he was already standing, his hand gently brushing hers as he led her toward the pool table. The contact sent a shiver up her spine, and she found herself following him, a strange thrill bubbling up. She wasn’t used to this—someone being so... forward with her. The touch of his hand on hers was electric, an unfamiliar warmth that made her feel almost flustered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He handed her the cue stick and stood behind her, adjusting her grip on it. His fingers brushed her arm as he showed her the proper stance. “Like this,” he said, his voice quiet but warm. His hand lingered on hers for a moment too long, and Agatha could feel the heat radiating off of him, his closeness making her heart beat a little faster. She hadn’t realized how much she missed being touched by someone who wasn’t tangled in layers of complication, someone whose touch didn’t come with baggage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Like this?" Agatha asked, glancing up at him through her lashes, now acutely aware of his breath on her neck. She shifted slightly, feeling a mix of curiosity and discomfort—she wasn’t used to this kind of attention. It felt nice, but at the same time, it was so unexpected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Stephen said, a slight smirk on his lips. He moved even closer, his body pressed against hers as he guided her through the motions, his hand still on her arm. The closeness felt... good. She hadn’t realized how much she’d missed being close to someone in a way that didn’t feel strained or artificial.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Stephen moved to take his shot, Agatha glanced up, half expecting to see Rio’s seething glare still fixed on her from across the room. The weight of it had been like a constant, gnawing presence at her back, but when she scanned the crowd, she realized—Rio was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension, the sharp, biting awareness that had been gnawing at her for the past hour, evaporated. Rio was no longer watching. Agatha was free to breathe again, to let herself enjoy the moment without that oppressive awareness dragging at her every movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned her attention back to Stephen, letting herself laugh and tease him as he lined up for his shot. For the first time tonight, Agatha felt... relaxed. The game, his attention, even the easy way he made her feel as if she belonged in the moment—it all combined to make her feel something she hadn’t in a while: at ease. She didn’t need to keep her guard up anymore. For the first time that night, the world felt less sharp, more forgiving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha played for a while with Stephen, her concentration split between the game and the subtle touches that lingered just a second too long each time he helped her adjust her stance. His fingers brushed hers with an ease that felt almost calculated, like he knew exactly how to make her feel a little off balance. Every time he leaned in close to show her how to line up a shot, she could feel the heat of his presence behind her, his hand resting on her waist for a second too long, his body brushing against hers when he reached past her. She couldn’t deny that she was enjoying the attention, even though it made her feel like she was venturing into unfamiliar territory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She found herself laughing more than she expected, teasing him about his pool skills, something light, something fun. For a moment, it seemed like nothing could spoil the night. Rio’s absence, her earlier tension, the weight of everything that had been eating at her—it all seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the easy rhythm of the conversation and the simple game before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she let herself enjoy the moment, a small part of her wondered just how far she’d let this go. The attention, the closeness—it felt good, but was it something she could trust? Or was she just too tired to question it, just too tired to keep wondering whether she was being played, whether this was all just another distraction from what really mattered? For now, though, Agatha was content to simply let herself be in the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But eventually, she excused herself, needing a moment away from the pulsing energy of the bar. The weight of the night had started to creep in, and she needed a break, even if just for a few minutes. She slipped away from the pool table and headed toward the bathroom, her heels clicking rhythmically against the floor. The steady cadence of her steps seemed to match the erratic thrum of her pulse as she walked, and when the door shut behind her, the buzz of conversation outside faded into an almost welcome silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned against the cool tile for a second, breathing in the quiet, letting the stillness wrap around her. But before she could even collect herself, she heard it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heavy breathing. A soft whimper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brows furrowed in confusion. What the hell? She froze, her hand hovering just inches from the lock, her mind struggling to process the sounds. They were unmistakable, but completely out of place in a bar bathroom. Agatha’s first instinct was to call out, to demand to know what was happening, but then, the voice came.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes, right there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words were low, almost a growl—raw, needy. It sent a chill down Agatha’s spine. Her body went rigid, paralyzed in shock, her breath hitching in her chest. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak, couldn’t make sense of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her blood ran cold, the realization hitting her like a truck.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She knew that voice.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>She forced herself to move, her feet carrying her out of the bathroom and back into the bar. She didn’t stop to say goodbye to Mariah or Alice or anyone else. The need to escape, to get out of that suffocating space, overwhelmed everything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her legs felt shaky as she stepped outside, the cool night air hitting her like a slap. She gulped it down, trying to calm the storm raging inside her, but her thoughts were relentless. Rio, with some random man, in the bar they had just been drinking in. The audacity, the carelessness of it—it made her want to scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Stephen followed her out of the bar, his presence felt like a grounding force, but it didn’t quite settle her. Not when she couldn’t get the sound of her moaning out of her head. He stood beside her, quiet, understanding, as if he knew she needed space. He didn’t try to kiss her or make any moves, just waited in silence as she scrolled through her phone, barely noticing when she ordered an Uber.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen’s voice startled her out of her spiraling thoughts. “Agatha?” he said gently, his concern evident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at him, her vision blurring slightly from the alcohol and the sheer force of her emotions. “I’m fine,” she muttered, the words bitter on her tongue. “Just tired. I had too much to drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stephen didn’t push, his gaze steady and understanding. He stayed beside her as she fumbled with her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you're okay?” Stephen asked quietly, his voice low, cautious. Agatha looked at him, not sure how to respond, not sure if she was </span>
<em>
<span>okay</span>
</em>
<span> or if she even knew what that meant anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha managed a weak smile, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “I’ll live,” she said, the words more for herself than for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the Uber pulled up, Stephen waited until she climbed in before stepping back. She didn’t look at him as the car drove away, her thoughts too loud and chaotic to focus on anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she reached her house, the lights of the city were a dizzying blur, matching the swirling mess of emotions inside her. She thanked the driver distractedly, barely registering his response as she stumbled up the steps to her door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once inside, the silence felt deafening. She leaned against the door, her forehead pressed to the cool wood, her breathing uneven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The anger still burned hot, but beneath it was something far worse—a dull, aching emptiness she couldn’t shake. She clenched her fists, willing herself to let it go, but she felt the weight of it all crash down on her. All she felt was the dull, aching realization that she was alone again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alone, and haunted by the sound of Rio’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—---------</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the warmth first, like sunlight filtering through a canopy of trees, caressing her skin in slow, deliberate waves. It wasn’t just a sensation; it was a presence, heavy and comforting yet charged with an undercurrent of tension. The air around her seemed thicker, humming faintly with an invisible energy, drawing her in, holding her captive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then came the touch. Soft, deliberate, like silk brushing against her bare shoulders, but with an intensity that made her shudder. It moved with purpose, tracing patterns that ignited sparks wherever it landed, as if each stroke of unseen fingers was an invocation of something primal. Her breath hitched, her body alive in a way that felt raw and untamed, every nerve lit with a tantalizing awareness. She couldn’t see anything, but the sensation was too vivid, too immediate to question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood there, weightless, her senses heightened and every sound muted except for the rhythmic pulse of her own heartbeat. A faint warmth prickled at her skin, growing hotter, almost unbearable, as if the darkness itself was alive and reaching for her. It moved over her like a tide, sweeping through her, leaving her trembling and breathless. She wasn’t afraid, not exactly, but a strange, electric anticipation coiled in her chest, drawing her deeper into the void without resistance. It was as if the shadows whispered her name, pulling her closer to something unseen, something that made her skin hum with awareness and longing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was surrounded by shadow, her body tingling with a heat she couldn’t escape. Gentle hands moved over her skin, their touch maddeningly light at first, teasing the barest edges of sensation before pressing with firmer intent, tracing lines that sent shivers through her, the touch both delicate and insistent, like a painter sculpting her out of smoke and fire. They explored her, tracing the curve of her shoulders, the line of her spine, and the dip of her waist. Each motion felt deliberate, as though she were being mapped, memorized. The hands lingered, tracing the lines of her collarbone, then down the curve of her arms, sparking shivers that cascaded down to her fingertips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath came in shallow gasps as the hands slid lower, their touch featherlight but unrelenting, tracing the curve of her hip, the tender flesh of her thighs, before moving back up in slow, deliberate strokes. Every nerve in her body was alight, raw and exposed, begging for more even as she felt herself unraveling. Her body arched instinctively toward the touch, a silent plea she couldn’t contain, as though her very essence was being unraveled, thread by thread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The touch continued, teasingly slow, unraveling her layer by layer. She needed this. She needed more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fingers brushed against the sensitive hollow of her neck, then slid over her chest with an excruciatingly deliberate pressure, making her pulse race. Her breath hitched again as those phantom hands caressed the curve of her ribs, the flat of her stomach, and lower still, each motion measured and exact, designed to push her further into the haze of sensation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She whimpered softly, the sound foreign and obscene to her own ears. It escaped her lips unbidden, raw and unrestrained, a reflection of the turmoil building inside her. The hands on her body, so light and teasing moments before, suddenly grasped her tight and held her still. A warm body pressed against her back, firm and solid, anchoring her to the darkness as her mind spiraled into chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath hitched as fingers slid over her heat, sending waves of pleasure through her body. She was so close, her need nearly overwhelming her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she was still missing something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to speak, to demand an answer, but no words came. Her lips parted, but all she could manage was a strangled gasp. Instead, a voice whispered from the darkness, low and commanding, each word striking like a match in the thick blackness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>That’s it, Agatha,</span>
</em>
<span>” it said, smooth and intoxicating, wrapping around her like a velvet chain. </span>
<em>
<span>“Let go for me.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse quickened, the voice curling through her like smoke, intoxicating and relentless, leaving her trembling and confused. The timbre of it brushed against a memory she couldn’t quite grasp, familiar yet elusive, achingly so. The sensation of closeness, of being held, consumed her completely, and yet she felt an ache, a hollowness, as though something vital was missing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted, desperate to call out, to ask, to beg—but the voice dissolved into silence, and the hands that held her vanished into the void. The warmth faded, replaced by an aching coldness that left her breathless and yearning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could make sense of the longing and fear tangled in her chest, her eyes snapped open. She bolted upright in bed, her heart pounding so violently it felt as though it might shatter. Her room was bathed in pale moonlight, serene and indifferent, a stark contrast to the lingering heat and shadow that still clung to her skin like a phantom. Her head throbbed, and she realized she was still in her clothes from last night, the tight black sleeves clinging to her skin, her feet bare now, though she didn’t remember taking off her boots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The memories of the bar hit her in scattered bursts. Stephen’s warm hands guiding hers as they lined up a shot, the soft clink of pool balls breaking apart, the dim glow of neon lights casting shadows across his face. And then Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Always Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her intense gaze had cut through the haze of alcohol like a blade, sharp and unrelenting. Agatha remembered the way Rio had watched her, how her eyes seemed to see right through her. And then the sound. The unmistakable sound of Rio’s voice in the bathroom, smooth and low, echoing faintly through her mind. Her stomach twisted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, her breathing uneven as she tried to shake off the weight pressing down on her chest. The dream… was it just her mind playing cruel tricks? Or was it something more?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She told herself it was nothing. A dream, a vivid one, yes, but nothing more. Yet her body betrayed her. She felt it—deep in her chest, a warmth that began to spread outward, seeping into her limbs and pooling low in her stomach. It wasn’t the alcohol. It wasn’t the creeping tendrils of a hangover. It was something else, something unnameable, something that left her weak and unsteady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers gripped the edge of the bed as the heat grew stronger, making her feel feverish, dizzy, as though the room itself were tilting under her. Her heart raced, every beat reverberating through her body like a drum. What the hell was happening? She closed her eyes, desperate to steady herself, but the sensation only deepened. It was as if the dream hadn’t ended, as if the voice and the touch had followed her into waking life, leaving her raw and exposed, her nerves alight with sensations she couldn’t explain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get a grip,” she muttered to herself, her voice barely audible, but even as she spoke, it wavered, betraying the confusion and unease roiling within her. She hated this feeling—this vulnerability, this sense that she wasn’t in control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swung her legs over the side of the bed, trying to ground herself, but even the coolness of the floor against her bare feet couldn’t shake the lingering heat coiling inside her. She pressed her palms against her face, desperate for clarity, for something tangible to hold onto. But her thoughts were as slippery as water, her emotions a chaotic tangle of fear, frustration, and something darker, something she wasn’t ready to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question loomed, heavy and unavoidable: was this about Stephen? The way his hand had lingered on hers, the way he’d smiled at her, the easy warmth in his touch? Or was it something deeper, something she didn’t want to confront?</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a frustrated sigh, Agatha stripped off her clothes, tossing them carelessly onto the floor. The sleek black outfit she’d worn to the bar—the one that had made her feel bold, confident, untouchable—now felt like a prison. The fabric clung to her damp skin like a second skin, suffocating her. She needed to shed it, to get it off, as if doing so could strip away the confusion that clung to her. She grabbed an old pair of pajamas from the back of her drawer, soft and familiar, the kind that sagged in all the right places. It wasn’t much, but it was a small comfort, a fragile shield against the storm raging inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She climbed back into bed, pulling the covers tightly around herself like armor. She willed herself to forget—to erase the dream, the heat, the way her body still thrummed with a pulse she couldn’t seem to control. But no matter how tightly she shut her eyes, she couldn’t escape the nagging sensation between her legs, the unmistakable dampness that refused to be ignored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cheeks burned with shame as she buried her face in her hands, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip to stifle the noise that threatened to escape. She clenched her fists, angry at herself, angry at her body for betraying her like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was ridiculous. It had to be the alcohol. That sharp whiskey buzz, the haze of too many cocktails, the way everything at the bar had felt heightened and surreal—it had to be that. And maybe… maybe Stephen’s lingering touches had stirred something in her. The way his fingers had lingered on hers, the casual intimacy of his hand brushing her lower back—it wasn’t much, but it was enough to remind her of a time when touch had been familiar, comforting, even thrilling. It had been over a year since she’d had sex, after all, and more than that since she’d felt truly desired by someone. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That had to be it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She was just touch-deprived, that’s all. A body starved of physical contact would respond to anything, wouldn’t it?. It was biological, she told herself. A purely physical response to human contact. She was overthinking it, letting her mind spiral. Touch was primal, instinctive. Her body didn’t care about context or reason; it was just reacting. It was natural to feel this way, wasn’t it? Even if it left her feeling raw and vulnerable, exposed in a way she hated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she clung to that explanation, trying to calm the racing of her heart, a small, stubborn voice in the back of her mind whispered that this wasn’t about Stephen, at least not entirely. Stephen’s touch had been warm, yes, but it hadn’t lit her up from the inside. It hadn’t left her trembling, her skin still humming hours later, or made her wake up drenched in heat and desire. Whatever had caused this feeling went beyond a simple lack of contact. It was something darker, something that refused to be rationalized away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was about the dream. The voice. The hands that had touched her so intimately, so expertly, like they knew her body better than she did. The way her name had rolled off lips she couldn’t see but could still feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath hitched, her chest tightening as the memory of it flooded back in vivid detail. It wasn’t just a dream. It couldn’t be. But if it wasn’t… What was it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up abruptly, rubbing her temples as if she could scrub the intrusive thoughts from her mind. Her skin felt clammy, a faint sheen of sweat clinging to her despite the early morning chill creeping through the room. She needed to cool down. To clear her head. To make herself stop feeling like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a frustrated groan, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and padded to the bathroom, her bare feet silent against the hardwood. The light above the mirror buzzed faintly as it flickered on, its harsh brightness stinging her eyes, but she didn’t care. Her movements were automatic as she turned the shower knobs, setting the water to as cold as it would go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The spray hit the porcelain tiles with a sharp hiss, already fogging up the mirror. Without hesitation, Agatha stepped under the icy deluge. The shock was instant. She gasped, her body jolting as the freezing water hit her skin like tiny needles. Her breath came in sharp bursts, and for a moment, all she could do was stand there, bracing herself against the chill. It was unbearable—and exactly what she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the cold water poured over her, it stripped away the lingering haze of sleep and heat, forcing her to focus on the present. Her fingers curled against the tile wall for balance, the slick surface cool beneath her touch. The shock of the water should have numbed her, dulled everything, but instead, it brought the ache into sharper relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t been touched—really touched—in over a year. She’d told herself it didn’t matter, that she didn’t care. But the truth hit her now, stark and undeniable, as the ache of loneliness pressed against her chest like a weight she couldn’t lift. Her body, traitorous and desperate, remembered things she’d tried to forget.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her forehead fell against the cold tiles, her wet hair plastered to her cheeks. It wasn’t like she missed Daniel. God, no. He was a mistake she’d spent years unraveling, a wound she’d sewn shut and refused to reopen. But tonight’s fleeting brushes of contact, the alcohol, the dream—they’d messed with her head, stirred something she hadn’t even realized was dormant. She was vulnerable, touch-deprived, and her subconscious had latched onto something, anything. It wasn’t real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It couldn’t be real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The idea of the dream being something deeper sent a jolt of fear through her. No. She wouldn’t let herself spiral. Couldn’t. Whatever had happened in that dream was a fluke, nothing more than a symptom of exhaustion and isolation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, as she stood under the relentless cascade of icy water, the denial she clung to felt fragile, like a sheet of glass cracking under the weight of something far too heavy to hold. The cold couldn’t extinguish the heat coiling deep within her, or the unsettling sensation that the dream had been more than just her mind playing tricks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—---------</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke with a start, her head pounding viciously, the kind of pain that felt as though her skull might split in two. Her mouth was dry as sandpaper, her stomach churning with nausea that threatened to send her running to the bathroom. She groaned, attempting to shift, but even the simple motion of lifting her head sent waves of dizziness rolling through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama!” Nicky’s excited voice pierced through the haze, his small hands shaking her shoulder insistently. “It’s Pancake Saturday!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely opened her eyes, squinting against the bright light filtering through the curtains. It was too much—everything was too much. Agatha buried her face into the pillow, groaning. “Nicky,” she rasped, her voice dry and gravelly, “Mama’s not feeling well today. How about… pancakes tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it’s Saturday,” he insisted, his tone teetering on the edge of a whine. “Pancake Saturday, Mama!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced herself to sit up, her movements slow and stiff. The pounding in her head only intensified as she squinted at her son’s hopeful face. Guilt twisted her gut, but she could barely keep herself upright, let alone think about flipping pancakes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, buddy,” she managed weakly, pressing a hand to her temple. “But Mama’s really sick today. How about cereal instead? You love cereal, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pouted, crossing his arms over his chest. “But you promised,” he muttered before stomping out of the room in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flopped back onto the bed, groaning again. She wanted to disappear into the mattress, to let it swallow her whole. Every part of her ached, and the nausea wasn’t easing. After a few moments, she forced herself up, her feet dragging as she shuffled toward the bathroom. Splashing cold water on her face, she took a deep breath, willing the sickness to subside. It didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Where was her phone?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought jolted her slightly more awake. She reached for the nightstand, but it was empty. Frowning, she checked her pockets—still nothing. Panic began to creep in. What if she’d lost it at the bar? What if someone else had it? A million embarrassing possibilities raced through her foggy mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stumbled back into the bedroom, her bleary eyes scanning every corner, but the phone was nowhere to be found. Her brain felt like a muddled mess, struggling to reconstruct the events of the night before. She remembered playing pool with Stephen, laughing at his jokes, his warm hand guiding hers as she lined up shots. The bathroom incident lingered. But after that? Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembered the dream, the shower later, the water scalding her skin as she tried to scrub away thoughts she didn’t want to admit were lingering. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach growled angrily, reminding her of Nicky downstairs, likely sulking by now. Guilt tugged at her, and despite her shaky legs, she dragged herself toward the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she walked in, she froze. There, sitting on the counter by the coffee machine, was her phone. Relief flooded her for a moment—until she picked it up and unlocked the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>15 New Messages</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach sank as she scrolled through them. Most were from Mariah.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Girl, you left with the hottie?!”</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>“I saw you two playing pool, you’re welcome, by the way ”</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>“Hope you had fun... in more ways than one ;)”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned aloud, her face heating with embarrassment. “Oh, God, no,” she muttered to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah’s teasing continued relentlessly as she scrolled.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You better tell me everything. Don’t leave me hanging!”</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>“You owe me details. ALL the details.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Then the final message, sent early that morning: </span>
<em>
<span>“Hope you got lucky, babe. You deserve it.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to throw her phone across the room. Her mind raced, trying to piece together what had happened after she left the bar. Did she even say goodbye to her friends? She vaguely remembered Stephen walking her out, his hand on her back, steadying her tipsy steps. But after that? Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made her stomach flip, not from nausea this time, but from sheer mortification. She had no idea what Mariah thought she knew—or worse, what Stephen might have said to them before they left. God has he even talked to them? All memories were blurry in her mind. And then there was the dream. The heat. The touch. It lingered, unsettling and too vivid, like an unwelcome shadow following her into waking life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, her head pounding and her stomach twisting in protest at the thought of standing in the kitchen. The idea of making pancakes felt impossible. She could barely manage to get herself out of bed, let alone stand over a hot stove. The smell of food made her stomach churn, and the thought of flipping pancakes—especially with Nicky's eager little face watching her—seemed too much to handle in her current state.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a heavy sigh, she made a decision. “Alright, Nicky,” she called out, wiping a hand over her face. “How about we go out for pancakes today? I think Mama needs a break.” The moment the words left her mouth, she instantly regretted them. But Nicky’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his excitement palpable. It was worth it, she told herself. One more day of powering through. After all, she was his mom, and she had to get up, even when she felt like death warmed over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pancakes at a café! Yay!” Nicky shouted, already rushing to get his shoes on. Agatha sighed again, feeling guilty that she didn’t have the energy to make this Saturday special in the way she'd promised, but at least a café would give them both a change of pace. Plus, if she sat still long enough, maybe the warmth of the place would ease the throbbing in her skull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely managed to drag herself through the motions of getting ready. Her head pounded relentlessly, and every step felt like wading through molasses. Food was the last thing on her mind, but Nicky’s persistence was relentless. After a lukewarm shower that did little to ease her lingering nausea, she threw on a pair of sunglasses to shield her bloodshot eyes and pulled her hair into a haphazard bun. Nicky, bundled up in his favorite jacket and scarf, tugged at her hand impatiently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The café they ended up at was quaint, its interior filled with the soft hum of morning conversations and the comforting scent of fresh coffee and pancakes. Large bay windows framed a picturesque view of the ice-skating rink outside, where a handful of skaters twirled and glided under the crisp winter sunlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes lit up the moment they stepped inside. “Mama, look!” he exclaimed, pointing toward the rink. His face was pressed against the glass before they even made it to their table, leaving a foggy smudge on the pristine surface. Agatha sighed, her stomach sinking with regret. Of course, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was where she decided to bring him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the warmth of the café was a welcome relief from the biting cold outside. Nicky immediately dove into the menu, his excitement growing by the second. He ordered chocolate chip pancakes with extra whipped cream, practically bouncing in his seat as he waited. Agatha, on the other hand, stuck to coffee, cradling the warm mug between her hands like it was the only thing tethering her to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Nicky chattered away about school, superheroes, and everything in between, his gaze kept drifting back to the rink. Between bites of pancake, he suddenly stopped mid-sentence and pressed his face to the glass again, watching as a young woman executed a graceful spin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama,” he said, turning back to her with wide, hopeful eyes, “can we do that for my birthday? Please? I want to skate!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair. “Nicky, you can’t just hop on the ice like that. It’s not something you learn overnight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I want lessons!” he insisted, bouncing in his seat again. “Like Disney on Ice! Wanda said it was cool”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, shooting a glare into her coffee. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course Wanda said that.</span>
</em>
<span> “I’m going to kill Wanda,” she muttered under her breath. “This is her fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once breakfast was over, Nicky could hardly contain his excitement. As they stepped outside, he bolted toward the ice rink, his little legs carrying him faster than Agatha could manage, especially with her throbbing headache.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “Nicky!” Agatha called, panic flaring as she hurried after him, her voice strained and raspy from the pounding in her skull. The cold air didn’t help, and every step felt like a small victory against the dizzying wave of discomfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A young rink attendant, likely in his early twenties, stepped forward to intercept the boy before he could get too close to the ice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa there, buddy,” he said with a soft laugh. “You can’t just jump on the ice without skates or a grown-up. You’ve gotta be careful, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, already bouncing on his heels, pouted but didn’t give up. “I wanna skate like Disney on Ice!” he declared, eyes wide with hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The worker chuckled, glancing up at Agatha, who was just catching up to them, breathing a little heavier than she would’ve liked. “He’s got big dreams,” the worker said, his grin widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, still holding onto Nicky’s hand as she knelt down beside him, sighed in a dry, tired tone. “You have no idea,” she said, trying to catch her breath. “Come on, kiddo. Let’s leave the rink to the professionals today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But, Mama—” Nicky began, but she cut him off gently, giving his hand a reassuring squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Another time,” she said firmly, leading him away from the rink. Her head was pounding more intensely now, and all she wanted was to get back to the warmth of the car and disappear into the silence of their home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she guided Nicky back toward the exit, the young worker stood up, brushing a light layer of frost from his gloves. “Actually,” he called after them, “we run skating lessons here every weekend. I teach the beginners myself. If your little guy’s interested, you should check it out sometime. He’d love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused for a moment, forcing a polite smile as she steered Nicky closer. “Thanks,” she said, her voice tight, “I’ll think about it.” She didn’t have the energy to commit to anything right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Nicky wasn’t ready to give up. “Mama! Please? I wanna skate like them!” He pointed at a pair of skaters effortlessly gliding across the ice in perfect harmony.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile was tight. “We’ll see,” she said, her tone final, signaling that the conversation was over for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The worker smiled warmly at Nicky’s enthusiasm and gave him a friendly wave. “I’m here every Saturday morning if you change your mind. Have a good day, buddy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky waved back eagerly, still buzzing with excitement, as Agatha, feeling the weight of the moment, steered him away. The entire walk back to the car was filled with his relentless pleading, making Agatha regret ever stepping foot near the rink in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they got home, Agatha practically collapsed onto the couch, her body heavy with exhaustion. Her head throbbed relentlessly, the aftermath of the hangover clinging to her like a fog. Nicky, oblivious to her misery, busied himself with his toys, while Agatha dragged herself to her laptop, hoping to get a few things done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Opening her email, her eyes landed on the subject line: </span>
<em>
<span>Trauma Certification: Required Follow-Ups – Dr. Calderu</span>
</em>
<span>. Her stomach twisted in an instant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, for fuck’s sake," she muttered under her breath, clicking it open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The email contained a detailed outline of additional readings, research, and a joint assignment she was supposed to complete with Rio in order to plan the trauma certification. Attached were case studies they were required to review together with the first year residents. Agatha stared at the screen, her stomach sinking. Of all the things she wanted to deal with today, this was right at the bottom of the list. She groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky ran up to her holding a drawing, but Agatha barely registered it. Her mind was already spiraling. Not only would she have to face Rio again soon, but now they’d be working closely together—again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, Agatha closed her laptop, rubbing her temples in a futile attempt to ease the headache. “This day just keeps getting better,” she said to no one in particular, feeling the weight of everything pressing down on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day blurred into a haze of forced productivity. Desperate to distract herself, Agatha threw herself into preparing for Nicky’s upcoming birthday party. She gathered construction paper, markers, and stickers, crafting simple but cheerful invitations for Nicky’s daycare friends. Every moment she spent on the invites felt like a small victory, a break from the chaos in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She carefully wrote each name in bold letters, pausing occasionally to sip the coffee she’d made, the bitterness cutting through the fog in her mind. She didn’t know how other parents made this look so effortless. Every part of it felt like a struggle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Midway through, Nicky wandered into the room, curious. “Mama, what are you doing?” he asked, peering over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly slid the half-finished invitations out of sight, her smile forced but warm. “It’s a surprise,” she said, ruffling his hair. “Birthday stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes lit up. “For me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who else?” she teased, tapping him on the nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He grinned, his enthusiasm a brief balm for her frazzled nerves. Then, after a beat, his face grew thoughtful. “Are Tommy and Billy coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a second, the question hanging in the air. She plastered on another smile. “I’m working on that, bud.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach sank as she realized she’d have to call Wanda. The memory of Mariah’s teasing at the bar the night before was bad enough, and now she’d have to face Wanda’s inevitable questions. The idea made her want to crawl under the table and never come out. But an invitation was an invitation, and Nicky clearly wanted his friends there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a resigned sigh, she steeled herself. “Why don’t you go play? I’ll handle it,” she told Nicky, ushering him out of the room before retreating to her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, staring at her phone like it might bite her. Her thumb hovered over Wanda’s number for a moment before she finally dialed, letting out a deep breath as the line rang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda picked up on the second ring, her voice lilting with amusement. “Agatha,” she said, drawing out the name in a way that already made Agatha regret this decision. “I was wondering when I’d hear from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, grimacing. “Wanda, hi. I, uh, wanted to talk to you about something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sure,” Wanda replied, her tone far too innocent. “But first… how’s the hangover?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, flopping back onto the bed. “I’m going to kill Mariah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed, the kind of laugh that made it clear she was enjoying this far too much. “Oh, you’ll have to get in line. She called me first thing this morning and gave me </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> the juicy details. Said you were the life of the party last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was not,” Agatha grumbled, already dreading what Mariah might have shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, but you were,” Wanda insisted, her voice positively gleeful. “Mariah said you were holding court at the bar like some kind of queen, tossing back whiskey like it was water. And then, of course, there was the mysterious man…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There was no-” Agatha started, but Wanda steamrolled over her, clearly enjoying herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I heard,” Wanda continued, her voice rich with mock scandal, “that you practically had the bartender begging for mercy. Something about </span>
<em>
<span>‘I know your game, sweetie,’</span>
</em>
<span> and then leaving with this so-called </span>
<em>
<span>‘mystery man.’</span>
</em>
<span> Care to elaborate on </span>
<em>
<span>that?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, pressing the heels of her hands to her eyes. “There was no ‘mystery man.’ Mariah is a pathological exaggerator.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sure, Agatha,” Wanda teased. “That’s why she said you were sneaking out, stumbling out like a teenager sneaking home after curfews with this mysterious man,.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up, glaring at the ceiling as if Wanda could feel the weight of her annoyance through the phone. “I didn’t sneak out. I left like a responsible adult.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With a random guy in tow?” Wanda quipped, and Agatha could hear the grin in her voice. “Who was it? A dashing stranger? A rugged sailor? Some poor soul who didn’t know what he was getting into?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t leave with anyone!” Agatha snapped, though there was no real heat in her voice. “Mariah is just trying to make me miserable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hummed, clearly unconvinced. “Uh-huh. Well, if you change your story, let me know. I’ve got popcorn at the ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, wishing the earth would swallow her whole. “I’m never drinking again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sure,” Wanda teased, laughing. “I’ve heard that one before. Honestly, Agatha, I don’t know why you don’t go out more often if you’re going to give us this much material every time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we focus?” Agatha snapped, though her tone was more exasperated than angry. She could hear Wanda’s stifled laughter on the other end, and she took a deep breath to steady herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Wanda said, though her voice was still tinged with amusement. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, trying to compose herself. “Nicky’s birthday is next Saturday. I’m throwing him a party, and he specifically asked if Tommy and Billy could come. I thought I’d extend the invitation to you and Vision, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, followed by an excited gasp from Wanda. “That’s so sweet! Of course we’ll come! The boys will be thrilled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a small sigh of relief, though Wanda’s enthusiasm was almost overwhelming. “Great. I’ll send you the details.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything I can bring?” Wanda asked, her voice practically bubbling with energy. “Snacks? Drinks? Oh, I can make one of those Pinterest cakes—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, it’s fine,” Agatha interrupted, smiling despite herself. “Just bring yourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Wanda agreed, and Agatha could almost hear the grin in her voice. “And Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you got lucky yesterday. You deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sputtered, her face instantly heating. “I didn’t—Wanda, for the love of—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Wanda interrupted, clearly savoring Agatha’s discomfort. “I’m just saying, if anyone needs a little fun in their life, it’s you. Whether it’s a man or even just yourself…” She trailed off with a mischievous chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodbye, Wanda,” Agatha said sharply, her tone a mix of mortification and amusement as she hung up the phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she just sat there, staring at the device in her hand, a bemused smile tugging at her lips despite herself. Wanda always had a way of getting under her skin, but maybe that was why Agatha couldn’t bring herself to stay mad at her for long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she set the phone down, the faint smile lingered. One thing down, a thousand more to go. At least the party was one step closer to being organized. Now, she just had to survive the rest of the week—and maybe figure out how to ignore the way Wanda’s teasing made her stomach twist, just a little, in ways she didn’t want to dwell on too deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sank onto the couch, her head falling back against the cushions as she tried to focus on her breathing. The room felt too still, too quiet, yet her mind wouldn’t stop spinning. Rio’s voice from the bathroom still echoed faintly in her ears, stirring emotions she didn’t want to name. And then there was Stephen—his steady presence, his kindness—a maddening contrast to the chaos Rio always left in her wake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It all felt tangled, like a knot she couldn’t unravel, no matter how hard she tried. Agatha pressed her palms to her eyes, desperate for clarity, but the more she tried to make sense of it all, the less grounded she felt. Everything blurred together—Stephen’s calm gaze, Rio’s infuriating smirk, the sharp ache of loss and the overwhelming fatigue of trying to hold it all together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly, hoping for some quiet, but her thoughts filled the silence, relentless and loud, leaving her more exhausted than before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Memories hovered at the edges of her mind, threatening to drag her back to the humiliating reality of what she’d done and how…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She refused to let herself go there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not tonight. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not ever.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>Agatha’s dreams were vivid again, too real, too close. She could feel phantom hands trailing over her body, their touch insistent and warm. Her breath hitched as the sensation grew more defined—lips brushing against her shoulder, a smirk pressed to her back, lingering kisses that ignited a heat beneath her skin. She couldn’t see the person, but their presence was overwhelming, inescapable. A familiar feeling, a longing buried deep within her, rose to the surface, and she felt herself leaning into it, unable to pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, with a jolt, she was awake, gasping for air. Her heart thudded violently in her chest, drowning out all other sounds. The room was dark and eerily silent, but the weight of the dream clung to her, thick and suffocating, as if the phantom touch still lingered in the air. She sat up slowly, disoriented, blinking at the darkness around her. It took a few moments to steady her breathing, to convince herself that it was just a dream. But the residue of it—the heat, the sensation, the phantom presence—refused to fade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was happening to her? This was the second night in a row she’d had a dream like that, and it was starting to unnerve her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks burned, not just from the residual heat of the dream, but from the overwhelming flood of guilt that followed. Her mind spiraled as she tried to make sense of it.</span>
</p><p><em><span>Why now?</span></em> <em><span>Why this?</span></em><span> </span></p><p>
<span>It had been years since she’d felt anything like that, and her body was betraying her, reacting to something she couldn’t even name. She felt a twinge of panic—what was she becoming? She clenched her fists, frustration bubbling up to the surface, threatening to overflow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she felt it. A dampness between her thighs, unmistakable, undeniable. She squeezed her eyes shut in mortification, wishing she could erase the sensation from her body, from her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>For fuck’s sake</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought. The surge of arousal—of need—made her skin burn with shame. She wasn’t supposed to feel this way. She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to scream into the quiet of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her frustration boiled over, a whirlwind of emotions she couldn’t quite pin down—anger, confusion, shame—and before she could stop herself, her hand slid beneath the waistband of her pajama pants. But the moment her fingers brushed against the undeniable evidence of her arousal, she froze. A sick, twisting feeling churned in her stomach, and she yanked her hand away as if she’d been burned. Her breath came in shallow, frantic bursts, her chest tight with a mix of guilt and disgust.</span>
<em>
<span>No. I’m not doing this,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought, pressing her palms flat against the mattress to anchor herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat there for a moment, her heart racing and her thoughts spiraling out of control. The idea of giving in to whatever this was felt... wrong. She hadn’t done this in years—not since she was much younger, experimenting out of a vague curiosity or trying to soothe the ache of loneliness. But even then, it had never felt like a release. Masturbating had always been more of an empty gesture, one that left her feeling hollow rather than satisfied. It wasn’t something she enjoyed or even thought about often.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The shame settled deep in her bones now, made worse by how out of control she felt. Was this what she had been reduced to? Letting her body betray her over things she couldn’t understand or explain? She shook her head fiercely, trying to banish the thoughts clawing at the edges of her mind. She swung her legs over the side of the bed, her resolve hardening. There was no way she could stay there, trapped in the suffocating aftermath of her emotions. She needed to move, to do something—anything—to pull herself out of this spiral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cold shower. </span>
<em>
<span>Now.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She could still feel the heat rising in her body, the tension coiling in her gut, but the guilt came crashing down harder, suffocating every ounce of desire. Her chest tightened as she stood, stomping toward the bathroom, the cold tile a harsh contrast to the warmth of her skin. The urge to just let go, to give in, was powerful, but she refused. She couldn’t—she wouldn't—let herself fall into this trap again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the shower on, the cold water pouring down in a rush, forcing her body to react. The chill was a sharp contrast to the heat that still simmered beneath her skin, but it was the only way to break the spell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the water cascaded over her, Agatha stood there for a long moment, letting the coldness numb her, trying to wash away the remnants of the dream, the guilt, the shame. It was just a dream. It didn’t mean anything. She had control over her body. She had control over this. But deep down, something lingered, a quiet ache that she couldn’t quiet, a reminder that some desires, some feelings, couldn't be so easily ignored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The icy spray was a shock to her system, but she welcomed it. Anything to drown out the lingering sensations from the dream and the confusing mess of emotions swirling in her chest. Anger at herself for losing control. Confusion about why she was having these dreams in the first place. Guilt for the rush of pleasure she’d felt in the moment, even though she’d had no idea who—or what—her mind had conjured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the cold water dripped down her back, the memory of Friday night hovered at the edges of her mind, threatening to drag her back to the humiliating reality of what she’d done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clenched her fists, shaking her head sharply.  But even as she tried to avoid it her thoughts betrayed her, circling back again and again to the hushed, intimate sounds she couldn’t unhear. Each time, she shoved them aside, burying them deeper, but they lingered, a persistent echo in the quiet of her house.Her mind betrayed her, taking her to the sounds that had rooted her to the spot, about the man with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And how she had stayed there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For far longer than she should have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just the thought of it made her stomach churn, the shame of her own actions twisting alongside the anger still simmering in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha froze, the reality of the situation slamming into her like a freight train. Her heart thudded painfully in her chest as she strained to hear more, her breath shallow and uneven. The sounds filtering through the thin wall of the bathroom weren’t just unmistakable—they were intimate, raw, and unapologetic.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She could feel every word like a dagger aimed right at her chest. The last thing she had expected was to find herself here, eavesdropping on something that felt far too personal. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio was still here, in the bar, and from the sound of it, she wasn’t alone.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Fuck," Rio’s voice murmured, low and breathless, each word laced with something that made Agatha’s stomach churn.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She stood paralyzed for a moment, torn between walking out and pretending she hadn’t heard anything, and confronting the situation head-on. The last thing she expected tonight was to hear that. The anger in her stomach twisted as she fought against the temptation to turn around and leave, to retreat into the darkness of the bar where she didn’t have to confront this. But it was too late. She had already heard enough.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>As she took a breath to steady herself, Rio moaned again, the sound unmistakable. It was louder now.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The fucking nerve. Her nails dug into her palm as her thoughts spiraled. She didn’t know what she’d expected—Rio’s audacity knew no bounds—but this? The way her chest burned with anger and something she didn’t want to name made her want to punch something.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s hand trembled on the doorknob, but she couldn’t bring herself to open it. She was caught in the surreal pull of the moment, the shocking realization that Rio, of all people, was fucking in a bars bathroom.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The urge to escape the bathroom—to leave the situation behind and walk away—was strong. But instead, she took another step back, deciding to listen longer. She couldn’t stop herself from feeling... something.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She knew the sound of Rio’s voice,it had haunted her for the past two weeks, and tried to escape it every single time. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And yet, here she was, eavesdropping like some kind of voyeur, unable to tear herself away.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She stayed frozen, waiting, listening.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Right there,” Rio’s voice whispered, softer this time, though it still managed to sting, like a taunt meant just for her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The seconds after the realization blurred into a haze, the sound of Rio’s voice still echoing in her head. Agatha’s thoughts were fragmented, broken up by flashes of frustration and disbelief. The anger bubbled up, but it was wrapped in confusion, and she could barely process what had just happened. What had she just heard? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The images, the sounds, felt like they were searing into her mind, but all she could do was stand frozen, her body a mixture of shock and guilt. Why was it so hard to breathe?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She didn’t know how long she stood there, but at some point, her feet began to move, and without thinking, she slipped out of the bathroom, the conversation still echoing in her mind, clouding everything. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, her anger and frustration coiling tighter and tighter until she felt like she might explode. She clenched her teeth so hard it made her jaw ache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bit the inside of her cheek, her fists trembling. It wasn’t just the betrayal she felt—because there was no real betrayal, was there? It wasn’t as though Rio owed her anything. No, what made her blood boil was the fact that she felt anything at all. And that the guilt she felt kept taking her to this memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced herself to focus on something else, anything else. She thought about Nicky. His bright, eager smile. His excitement at the idea of ice skating. Maybe she’d been too quick to dismiss it earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally stepped out of the shower, her hair dripping and her skin chilled, she felt marginally calmer. Sleep was clearly out of the question, so she grabbed her laptop and settled onto the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She typed </span>
<em>
<span>“figure skating lessons near me” </span>
</em>
<span>into the search bar, her fingers hesitant at first. The results popped up quickly, and she scrolled through the options, scanning the descriptions and reviews. Most of the rinks were far, but one caught her eye: a rink just a few blocks from Nicky’s daycare. It offered lessons for kids as young as three and promised a patient and encouraging environment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bookmarked the page, feeling a flicker of something close to relief. It wasn’t a bad idea. Maybe it would be fun for him—and for her, a distraction. She made a mental note to check it out with him tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, she closed her laptop and leaned back, staring at the ceiling. Her body was tired, but her mind refused to quiet down. Whatever was happening to her, she needed to get a handle on it. And fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Morning came too soon, as it always did. Agatha groaned, her body stiff and her head still foggy from yet another restless night. Dragging herself out of bed, she padded to Nicky’s room and coaxed him awake with the promise of a fun outing. After much negotiation—bribery in the form of pancakes—they quickly got ready and headed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The skating rink buzzed with activity, the crisp morning air blending with the faint smell of coffee from a nearby concession stand. Nicky pressed his hands and face against the glass barrier surrounding the rink, his eyes sparkling with curiosity as he watched the skaters glide effortlessly across the ice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, Mama!” he exclaimed, his voice filled with awe. “They’re skating so fast!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled despite herself, tucking her hands into her coat pockets. “Yeah, buddy. They’re pretty good, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A young woman with a bright smile and a clipboard approached them, her upbeat energy making Agatha feel sluggish by comparison. “Hi there! Welcome to Starlight Rink. First time here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Yeah. Me and my son, Nicky, wanted to check it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you picked a great day! We offer lessons every day with instructors for all age groups. There’s actually a beginner’s class starting in about twenty minutes if you’re interested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky gasped, turning to Agatha with wide, pleading eyes. “Mama! Can I? Please, please, please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll see,” Agatha said cautiously, glancing back at the young woman. “Can we just watch for now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course! But let me introduce you to the instructor for the next class,” the woman said, gesturing for them to follow. “He’s fantastic with kids.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed her reluctantly, keeping a hand on Nicky as his excitement made him bounce with every step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman led them to the edge of the rink, where a young man with dark hair and a kind smile was lacing up his skates. He looked up as they approached, and his eyes widened with recognition. They've already met. He was at the rink outside the coffee yesterday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“William! This is Nicky and his mom—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doctor Agatha Harkness,” he finished, standing up and extending a hand to her. “I know who you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. The pieces clicked into place, and she groaned inwardly. “Oh. Right. William, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“William Kaplan,” he confirmed with a laugh, extending his hand again. “Small world, huh? Sorry if I seemed over-eager. I’m a pre-med student, and I teach skating here to help cover tuition. But, honestly, meeting you is kind of surreal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, narrowing her eyes slightly. “Surreal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” William admitted, rubbing the back of his neck, suddenly looking a little shy. “You’re practically a legend in neonatal surgery. I’ve read your research papers. They’re, uh, pretty intense.” His smile widened. “In a good way. They’re part of why I’m pursuing medicine. It’s kind of incredible to meet you in person. I actually recognized you yesterday but... well, I didn’t want to intrude.” He hesitated, his smile sheepish. “You looked busy, and I figured it wasn’t the best time to, you know, gush about how much I admire your work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly, suspicion mixing with discomfort. She wasn’t used to being recognized outside of a hospital setting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His gaze shifted to Nicky, and his smile softened. “Well, if it isn’t the little buddy that wanted to skate on disney on ice,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky flushed shyly and ducked behind Agatha’s leg, peeking out at William with a tiny smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William crouched to Nicky’s level, keeping his tone warm and friendly. “So, what do you think? Want to try skating today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky hesitated, chewing his lip. “I dunno...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms, stepping in to save him from any pressure. “He’s a little nervous,” she explained. “It’s his first time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Totally normal,” William said, nodding. “A lot of kids feel that way at first. But I promise, once you’re out there, it’s so much fun you won’t want to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked up at Agatha, his big eyes pleading. “Mama, can I? Please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her protective instincts flaring. “I don’t know...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>William chimed in, his voice reassuring. “You can stay right by the edge and watch the whole time. I’ll make sure he’s safe, and he doesn’t even have to stay the whole lesson if he doesn’t want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long pause, Agatha relented. “Alright,” she said reluctantly. “But only for a little while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Nicky cheered, practically bouncing on his toes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William stood, grinning. “Great! Let’s get you some skates, Nicky. Come on, I’ll help you pick the right size.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as Nicky trotted off with William, his earlier shyness replaced by excitement. Her initial nervousness eased slightly. Maybe this wasn’t such a bad idea after all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she leaned against the glass, sipping a hot coffee she’d grabbed from the concession stand, she couldn’t help but smile as Nicky listened attentively to William’s instructions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a brief moment, the chaos of the past few days faded into the background, replaced by the sight of her son taking his first tentative steps onto the ice. It wasn’t perfect—he wobbled, arms flailing—but William was there, steady and patient, encouraging him every step of the way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile despite the nagging weight in her chest. This was the first time in a while she’d seen him so engaged in something, so determined. He looked so small on the ice, but there was something undeniably sweet about how he fought to stay upright.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William skated beside him, offering gentle words of encouragement, and it made Agatha’s heart swell with a strange mix of pride and gratitude. Nicky was so brave, and William seemed to have a natural way of connecting with him. The instructor’s presence was reassuring, even though Agatha still couldn’t shake the nervous tension that lingered in her body. There was always a part of her that hovered on high alert, especially with Nicky’s safety. But the way William had handled him so far eased her concerns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Nicky practiced a small glide, his eyes glistening with excitement, Agatha’s mind wandered. She found herself thinking about how much this new activity could be the perfect opportunity for both of them. For Nicky, it was an adventure—a new skill to learn, a way to focus his energy. But for Agatha, it was something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alone time.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers tightened around her arms, as if trying to hold herself together. Between work, Nicky’s needs, and the weight of her own complicated emotions, there had been precious little time for herself. Between the meetings with her colleagues, the constant juggling of Nicky’s care, and the endless pile of responsibilities, she’d been drowning. This could be the key to finding a sliver of peace. If Nicky could have a structured, regular activity, and if she could manage it around her schedule, maybe—just maybe—she could carve out an hour a day where she didn’t have to be mom or Dr Harkness</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought seemed so simple, yet so impossible. But then again, this skating thing was a perfect fit. It was an hour of physical activity that could give Nicky a break from his usual routine while also giving Agatha time to breathe. His nanny could drop him off, pick him up afterward, and—most importantly—she wouldn’t have to worry about making sure everything at home was in perfect order. It was an option she hadn’t considered before, but now it seemed like exactly what she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked back over to the skating counter, where the woman from earlier was talking to some parents. She walked over and took a deep breath, bracing herself for the conversation she was about to have. She didn’t know why, but she felt a sudden rush of nerves, as though making this choice might come with some unforeseen consequences. Maybe it was because she hadn’t allowed herself this kind of luxury in so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman at the counter greeted her with a bright, practiced smile, the kind of enthusiasm Agatha could tell came naturally to someone who worked around children all day. Agatha cleared her throat, shuffling Nicky’s jacket from one arm to the other before speaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, I was wondering if you could tell me more about your lesson packages”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman’s smile brightened even further. “Of course! We offer a variety of programs depending on your child’s skill level and goals. Since it sounds like you’re looking for something more structured, I’d recommend our after-school intensive program. It’s perfect for kids who want to develop their skating skills quickly. The program focuses on technical skills, balance, and even some basic choreography as they progress.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, pretending to be entirely unfazed by the mention of “choreography.” She could already picture Nicky demanding to reenact scenes from </span>
<em>
<span>Disney on Ice</span>
</em>
<span>, and she felt a pang of dread at the thought. But at least he’d be happy—and busy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the cost for something like that?” Agatha asked, trying to sound casual while mentally bracing herself for the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” the woman said, pulling out a laminated chart from behind the counter, “our standard six-day-a-week program is $1200 per month. That includes group lessons, skate rentals, and practice ice time. If you’d like to add a private lesson once a week, the cost goes up to $120 per lesson. The private lessons can really help kids improve quickly since the instructor tailors everything specifically to their needs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at the numbers, doing a quick calculation in her head. It wasn’t bad at al. Her salary allowed her to afford things like this without much of a second thought. And considering how chaotic her life had been lately, giving Nicky a consistent activity—and giving herself an hour or two of quiet—was worth every penny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds reasonable,” she said, keeping her voice steady. “Are there any other fees I should be aware of?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We do require a one-time registration fee of $250, which covers insurance and administrative costs. Other than that, if you don’t already have skates, we do recommend purchasing a pair for him eventually. Rental skates are included in the program, but having his own pair will help with consistency as he progresses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “Okay. And what about gear? Anything specific he’ll need?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman smiled again and gestured to a rack of small helmets and padded gloves nearby. “For beginners, we recommend a helmet and gloves, both of which are optional but encouraged. You can buy them here or bring your own. As he advances, he might need specialty skating apparel, but for now, comfortable clothes that allow for movement are fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said.  “I think I’ll go ahead and sign him up for the six-day program with private lessons. He seems really excited about this, and I want to make sure he has the best chance to succeed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a fantastic choice,” the woman said, beaming. “I’ll get the paperwork started for you. Would you like to begin this week or start fresh next Monday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This week,” Agatha said firmly. “I’ll make it work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman handed her a neatly stapled packet of forms. “Perfect! Just fill these out and bring them back whenever you’re ready. Once we have your payment and registration fee, we’ll email you a confirmation with all the lesson details and his assigned instructor. He’ll be in great hands—our coaches are some of the best in the region.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Agatha replied, her lips curving into a small smile despite herself. As overwhelming as it all felt, she couldn’t deny the sense of relief washing over her. For the first time in weeks, maybe months, she felt like she was making a choice that would help both of them. Nicky would have something solid to focus on, and she would get a much-needed breather to focus on everything else spiraling out of control in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she turned back to the rink, she saw Nicky holding William’s hand, gliding smoothly across the ice with the kind of joy that only children seem to have. His face was lit up with a wide grin, and Agatha felt a surge of pride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the right decision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the lesson wrapped up, Nicky’s excitement was palpable. He was practically bouncing on his heels, his cheeks flushed from the cold and the exertion. William had given him one final round of applause for his efforts, and Nicky looked up at him with wide eyes, beaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did great today, buddy,” he said with a grin. “You’re a natural out there. Just keep practicing, and you’ll be skating like the pros in no time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Nicky asked, his voice filled with awe. “Like Disney on Ice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>William chuckled, nodding. “Exactly like that, Nicky. Just remember, it’s all about balance, practice, and—oh—having fun. Don’t forget to have fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled with pride as she watched the interaction. Nicky was so happy, so focused. For the first time in a long time, he seemed truly content, his mind completely absorbed by the ice beneath his feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, William !” Nicky shouted, waving as the instructor skated off to help another child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bent down to his level, brushing a lock of hair out of his face. “You did amazing, kiddo. I’m so proud of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “Mama, I want to get my own skates and everything!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, feeling her heart soften at his enthusiasm. “Of course, Nicky. Let’s get you everything you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They made their way off the rink, Nicky clutching her hand tightly, practically pulling her toward the skating shop. Agatha’s mind, however, was already calculating the costs. She had signed Nicky up for the six-day program, which was already a significant commitment, but now she was about to dive into purchasing all the necessary equipment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The shop was small but packed with everything a figure skater could need: boots, blades, padding, gloves, and helmets. The walls were lined with racks of colorful skates, the air filled with the smell of fresh leather and the faint scent of cold air. Agatha followed Nicky through the aisles, her thoughts swirling. It wasn’t going to be cheap. But she couldn’t help but think that, for once, this was something for Nicky—a real passion, an activity that could give him a sense of accomplishment and joy. It was worth every penny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The saleswoman approached them with a smile, a friendly, helpful look on her face. “Can I help you find anything today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said, glancing down at Nicky. “He’ll need everything. Skates, pads, the whole setup. He’s going to be doing the full six-day program, so I’d like to get him everything he’ll need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman nodded and led them toward the back of the store, where the higher-end skates were displayed. “These are our most popular options for kids starting figure skating. For his level, I recommend something supportive and durable, since he’ll be on the ice a lot. We also have skate sharpening available, so don’t worry about that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, trying to focus on the details as the woman guided her through the choices. Nicky, meanwhile, was in his element, trying on pairs of skates, his eyes lighting up every time he found one that felt “just right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a bit of back-and-forth between sizes and colors, Agatha finally made her choices: custom-fit skates, protective gear, socks, and a practice outfit. She didn’t blink an eye as the total climbed higher and higher. It was a lot, but it didn’t matter. It wasn’t every day that Nicky found something that made him this happy, something he could really invest his energy into. She would make it work. It wasn’t as though her doctor salary didn’t afford her the ability to treat her son to the best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were led to the counter, where the final tally made Agatha’s stomach tighten. The number came to well over $1600. She swallowed hard, but the feeling was fleeting. She wasn’t worried about the money. She would be fine. After everything with the divorce and the stress of balancing work and motherhood, this was one area where she felt like she could give Nicky the best. The investment in his happiness was worth every cent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, oblivious to the cost, grinned widely as the woman carefully packed everything up. “Thanks, Mama!” he said as she handed him the new skate bag, his joy spilling out in every word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything for you, kiddo,” Agatha said, squeezing his hand as they walked out of the store, the weight of the bag heavy but the feeling in her chest light. It wasn’t just the price tag that made it worth it. It was the look on Nicky’s face, his utter joy and excitement for this new adventure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They made their way back to the car, Nicky talking nonstop about how he couldn’t wait to go back to the rink and show off his new gear. Agatha listened, smiling, but in the back of her mind, the thoughts about the cost, the time commitment, and the other things that seemed to be piling up were always there, lurking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, though, she let herself enjoy the moment. Nicky was happy, and that was all that mattered. She would figure out the rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha got back to the house, the familiar sense of chaos and order collided in her mind. Nicky was already talking about something else—his new skates, his excitement for the next lesson, how he wanted to get better than the other kids. Agatha tried to focus on him, but a nagging thought kept poking at the back of her mind, slowly pulling her attention away from her son’s jubilant chatter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t checked her emails in a while, but she knew there was something waiting for her. The trauma certification. The one she had to prepare for—</span>
<em>
<span>with Rio.</span>
</em>
<span> The thought of it made her stomach churn, and the dread pooled in her chest like a stone. It was from Wednesday through Friday according to Lilia’s email she received yesterday. Just three days. But the time, the preparation, the possibility of working alongside Rio again—it all felt like a weight, one that threatened to suffocate her as she stood in the kitchen, half-listening to Nicky’s excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could already feel the tension from the bar creeping back into her mind, like a low hum. The night she’d spent there, the odd encounter with Stephen, the strange flirtation that had spiraled out of control. Rio’s presence in the background, her stony silence, her seething glances. The way Agatha had felt caught between two worlds, one where she was just trying to move on, and the other where Rio had found a way to worm her way back into Agatha’s head, even when she wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was the bathroom. That moment after the bar when Agatha had felt the heated rush of confusion, guilt, and something far more dangerous stirring inside her. She could still feel the echo of that heat, how it had left her weak, how the dream had felt too real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had spent most of the afternoon convincing herself not to call Rio, the weight of guilt pressing heavy on her chest. She hadn’t meant to stay and listen in the bathroom that night—at least, that’s what she told herself. But the truth was, once she’d realized Rio wasn’t alone, she’d been rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to stop herself from hearing every muffled laugh and intimate word exchanged through the thin walls. It was invasive, shameful, and it made her stomach churn every time she thought about it. The guilt burned brighter because she knew she’d lingered longer than she should have, caught in some twisted mix of anger and self-loathing. The memory of it made her skin crawl, and the idea of speaking to Rio, knowing what she’d overheard, felt unbearable. Every interaction would be tainted now, the unspoken knowledge wedged between them like a splinter she couldn’t pull out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sharp exhale, Agatha forced herself to step away from the kitchen and into the quiet of the hallway. She could hear Nicky babbling in the background, lost in his excitement, but Agatha knew she needed to confront this. She couldn’t ignore it any longer. The certification. Rio. The looming work they had to do together. She had no choice but to face it head-on, no matter how much it made her want to shrink away and hide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her phone, unlocking it with a trembling hand. The glow of the screen illuminated the room as she stared at the name glaring back at her: </span>
<b>Dr. Vidal.</b>
<span> The bold letters seemed heavier than they should have, as if the very presence of her name on the screen carried a weight Agatha wasn’t ready to bear. Every time she saw it, a strange shiver ran down her spine, something caught between unease and intrigue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why did everything seem more complicated when she was involved? Why couldn’t she just move past this gnawing, unresolved tension? Focus on her work, on Nicky, on anything that wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>. But no. She couldn’t. Not when it felt like an invisible thread was still pulling her toward Rio, tightening whenever she tried to move away. It was maddening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb hovered over the screen, and for a long moment, she debated with herself. Yet here she was, her finger trembling over the call button, fighting the sick knot of guilt and the stubborn refusal to admit just how deeply it had unsettled her. Against her better judgment, she tapped the call button. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone rang once. Twice. Agatha’s breath hitched, her thumb hovering over the “end call” button, but before she could retreat, Rio’s voice came through, sharp and clipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her tone curt, devoid of warmth. “What do you need?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her carefully rehearsed words dissolving under the weight of Rio’s voice. She cleared her throat, determined to sound composed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—" she began, but her voice faltered. She clenched her fist, grounding herself. “We need to talk about the trauma certification. It’s this week, and we’re running out of time to get everything sorted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A brief silence followed, heavy and expectant. Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened as the seconds stretched. She could almost feel Rio’s pointed scrutiny through the line, and it sent her stomach twisting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio’s voice returned, quieter but still firm. “Wednesday to Friday. I’ve seen Lilia’s memo. Research, protocols, case studies—we’ll need to finalize everything. Do you have the materials ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha replied, her tone a touch defensive. “I’ve gone through them. It’s just... I don’t know. It’s been a lot lately.” She hated how raw her words sounded, like she was peeling back layers she didn’t want Rio to see. “I just need some time to get into the right headspace for this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause. Agatha’s heart pounded in the stillness, her mind racing. Was Rio annoyed? Was she about to make some cutting remark? Or worse—dismiss her completely?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re avoiding this,” Rio said, her voice cool but with an undertone of exasperation. “We need to get it done. The residents are counting on us, and so is the program.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not avoiding it,” Agatha snapped, her frustration bubbling to the surface. She hated how defensive she sounded. “I’m just trying to figure things out. We both know this isn’t exactly... straightforward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio agreed, her tone softening slightly, though it still carried that frustratingly calm authority. “It’s not. But dragging your feet is only making it harder—for both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath, the tension in her chest easing just enough to speak without snapping. “I’ll be ready,” she said, her voice firm but quiet. “But we need to keep this professional. Focus on the certification, nothing else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s response was immediate, but her tone had shifted slightly, laced with something that sounded almost amused. “Professional? When have we not been, Dr. Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line at the faint teasing edge in Rio’s voice, but she didn’t bite. “I’m serious,” she said firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Understood,” Rio replied smoothly, though the tension between them lingered. “I’ll be in touch to finalize the schedule. See you Wednesday, Dr. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The line went dead, and Agatha was left staring at her phone, her mind racing. She tossed the device onto the couch and pressed her palms against her face, groaning softly into them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why did it always have to be like this? Every interaction with Rio felt like walking a tightrope, every word carefully measured yet always falling short of the balance she sought. The cold, detached nature of their conversation did nothing to ease the storm of emotions raging inside her. The dread, the guilt, the anger at herself for even feeling this way—about Rio, about the situation, about everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she tried to convince herself, that familiar shiver returned, lingering like an echo she couldn’t quite shake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rubbed her forehead, trying to calm her breathing. The day ahead—preparing for Nicky’s birthday, working through the certification—seemed like an endless list of things to do. But the worst part was how </span>
<em>
<span>alive</span>
</em>
<span> Rio’s presence still felt, even through the phone. Agatha had hoped she’d gotten some distance, but it was clear that, with each interaction, that thread pulling her toward Rio only tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she hated it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back on the couch, staring blankly at the phone screen. She could still feel the tension from her call with Rio, the coldness and distance that she couldn’t shake. Her heart was racing in her chest, her mind tangled in confusion and regret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone buzzed again in her hand, startling her. It was a message from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Looking forward to our professional rendezvous on Wednesday, Dr. Harkness. Let’s try to keep it that way, yeah?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, feeling a mix of irritation and something else she couldn’t quite place. It was less teasing than usual, but it still carried that sharp edge, the one that made Agatha’s pulse quicken. She typed out a quick reply, trying to suppress the conflicting emotions roiling inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sure,” </span>
</em>
<span>she typed, hitting send before she could second-guess herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seconds later, Rio’s reply came through:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Good. I’d hate for you to unravel at the last minute.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. There it was again—the teasing, but with just enough distance to make it sting. She wanted to call her out, snap back with something witty, but instead, she just stared at the screen, fighting the urge to let her emotions bubble over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly shoved her phone into her pocket, feeling a strange mix of frustration and... something else. Her mind raced, her chest tightening as the familiar guilt crept in. She knew she was overthinking everything. Rio’s words didn’t mean anything beyond what they were, just another layer of the complicated professional relationship they shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But still, there was something about her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. She needed to focus. She couldn’t let this mess with her head anymore. There was too much to do—Nicky’s birthday, the certification, everything else. She was a professional. She’d handle it. She’d keep it together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But a part of her—despite everything—was already dreading the week ahead, especially Wednesday.</span>

<p>
<span>Monday and Thursday blurred together in a chaotic whirlwind of surgeries, deliveries, and a constant stream of patients that never seemed to end. The 24-hour shift on Monday had been particularly draining. Agatha had barely had a chance to sit down, let alone catch her breath. She’d been running from one emergency to another, her mind constantly racing to keep up with the demands of the hospital. There was no time to think, no time to process anything. Everything was a blur of sterile rooms, beeping monitors, and the constant pressure of saving lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was supposed to be an exhausting but routine shift felt like an endless marathon. Her body ached, her mind was foggy from lack of sleep, and yet, somehow, she pushed through. There was no room for weakness when people were relying on you to make split-second decisions that could change their lives. In those moments, everything outside of the hospital—everything personal—faded into the background. She didn’t have time to think about the nagging feelings that had been bubbling up inside her, or the dream she couldn’t shake. No, her focus was entirely on the task at hand. She had no choice but to keep moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of Wanda teasing her about Friday night had crossed her mind in the midst of all the madness. Agatha had expected Wanda to make some kind of comment, to joke or ask about what had happened, but it never came. Instead, they barely saw each other, their worlds revolving around the chaos of their shifts and the patients that needed them. And when they crossed paths, it was brief. A quick exchange of pleasantries, the passing acknowledgment of another busy day ahead. It was a relief, honestly. As much as she hated being caught in that awkward space, the busy nature of her job gave her the distance she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thursday rolled around with its own challenges. Surgery after surgery, delivery after delivery. Agatha barely had time to eat. The hospital was a constant whirlwind, the sounds of the emergency room, the low hum of conversations between colleagues, the scurry of nurses moving from one room to another. She moved in a blur, performing her duties with the precision and care that had earned her respect in her field. But inside, she was numb, her mind constantly jumping from one thing to the next, unable to focus on anything beyond the immediate task.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The exhaustion was getting to her. Every night, she crawled into bed feeling like she had just run a marathon,  her body heavy and her mind foggy. Sleep came quickly, but it was never the peaceful kind. She would wake hours later, feeling like she had barely slept at all, her heart pounding, the taste of her restless dreams lingering like smoke in the air. It was a cycle that left her feeling frayed, but at least it served its purpose. It kept her mind distracted. And it kept her from thinking too much about Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t seen Rio since Friday night, and honestly, Agatha was starting to wonder if that was a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand, it was a relief. She didn’t have to deal with that gnawing feeling in the pit of her stomach every time they crossed paths. She didn’t have to face the quiet tension that seemed to hang between them. On the other hand, it made her realize just how much she missed their interactions, the way Rio challenged her, the way she pushed her buttons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, pushing those thoughts away. There was no time for that. She had work to do. And right now, all she could focus on was the certification she and Rio were working on for the first-year residents. The endless stream of emails and messages between them about the details was all they’d really shared. No personal exchanges, no teasing, no quiet glances across the room. Just the work. Just the professional tasks that needed to be completed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In some ways, it was easier this way. The distance between them, the strictly professional interaction—it made things simpler. Or at least, that’s what Agatha told herself every time she found her thoughts drifting toward Rio. But the truth was, it didn’t make her feel any better. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed between them, even if she wasn’t quite sure what it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The days passed in a blur, each one more exhausting than the last. But in the back of her mind, she knew what was coming. Wednesday. The certification. The looming tension that would undoubtedly hang between her and Rio, no matter how professional they tried to keep things. She couldn’t escape it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, though, all she could do was keep her head down, focus on the work, and hope that whatever was brewing inside her—whatever was making her feel this way—would just fade away. She couldn’t afford to get distracted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But deep down, she knew it wasn’t that simple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amidst the whirlwind of her own life, she barely had time to see Nicky. The long hours at the hospital left her with little energy for anything else, and her guilt gnawed at her every time she thought about it. She had made arrangements for his care, of course, with his nanny, but it didn’t feel the same. There were moments when she would catch herself scrolling through pictures on her phone, sent by the nanny, and each one hit her with a bittersweet pang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a picture from yesterday—Nicky in his little helmet, grinning ear to ear on the ice, clearly loving the lessons. His nanny had written in the message, </span>
<em>
<span>"He’s getting so good at it!"</span>
</em>
<span> The image of his wide smile made Agatha’s heart ache. She wished she could be there, watching him, cheering him on, but it felt like the universe was conspiring against her ability to be present in his life. Even though Nicky was thriving, enjoying his activities, it didn’t stop the sting of regret that she wasn’t the one to witness it firsthand. It was as if the world kept moving forward, and she was constantly running behind, just trying to keep up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then just like that Wednesday arrived. Agatha was dreading it, but she’d pushed her fears to the back of her mind, focusing on the task ahead. It had been a long morning already, filled with prep work and last-minute adjustments. She had opted for a purposefully sharp outfit : purple pants that hugged her legs perfectly, paired with a light blue blouse that accentuated her frame. The heels added just the right amount of confidence she needed, though she could feel the nerves beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha walked into the conference room that morning, her pulse quickened the moment she spotted Rio standing near the podium, her posture effortless, her presence commanding. It was the first time they’d been in the same room since that night at the bar, and the bathroom incident that Agatha couldn’t seem to scrub from her mind no matter how hard she tried. The memory was vivid. Agatha’s stomach twisted, guilt gnawing at her for staying to listen, for invading a moment she hadn’t been meant to witness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked through the conference room her heels clicked sharply against the polished floor, the sound almost too loud in the silence that surrounded her. She noticed that Rio was dressed impeccably in a deep blue suit, tailored so perfectly it looked as though it had been made just for her. The soft fabric hinted at polish and power, and the slightly undone white shirt underneath gave off an air of effortless elegance. The blue brought out a calm sharpness in her demeanor, but the faint glint in her eyes as she met Agatha’s gaze spoke of something more—challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, as Rio turned and their eyes briefly met, Agatha felt a rush of unease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice of you to finally show up,” Rio drawled, her tone smooth and edged with a teasing lilt that only she could master. “I was starting to think you’d chickened out”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, crossing her arms as she leaned slightly against the edge of the podium. Her voice was dry as she shot back, “Please, I’m not the one who thrives on theatrics, Vidal. And speaking of nerves, you might be overdressed for the occasion. Should I be worried you’re compensating for something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, clearly unbothered. Her response came quickly, the teasing edge still intact. “Oh, no. I just figured someone had to bring a little flair to this dry lecture. You’re the one who insists on delivering the tough love speech anyways. Very old school, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened, brushing off the comment with a flick of her hand. “Old school works. Unlike fluff, it actually gets results. But don’t worry, I’ll make sure these residents are too busy sweating to notice your fashion parade.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could retort, the room began to fill with first-year residents. They were eager and wide-eyed, their nervous energy almost palpable. Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly as she surveyed them, mentally sorting through their postures, their faces, their tells. Half of them wouldn’t make it through the year. The other half had no idea what they were in for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped aside, gesturing grandly toward the podium with a faint smirk. “All yours, Dr. Harkness. Break a leg. Though, knowing you, you’d probably just reset it and keep going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring her, Agatha ascended the podium with deliberate, steady clicks of her heels against the polished floor. The room hushed completely, and she let the silence linger, her gaze sweeping across the room with the kind of authority that made even the most confident of them shift uncomfortably in their seats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” she began, her tone brisk and no-nonsense. She let the greeting hang for a moment before continuing, her voice sharper now, slicing through the air like a scalpel. “For those of you who haven’t already Googled me, and I know you have, I’m Dr. Agatha Harkness. And no, I’m not as intimidating as you’ve heard.” she paused “Im worst”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few nervous chuckles rippled through the group, but Agatha’s raised eyebrow silenced them instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me make one thing clear,” she said, her voice steady and commanding. “As you've already noticed in the two months that you've been here this isn’t medical school anymore. There are no do-overs, no extra credit, and no professors to hold your hand. You’re here to learn how to save lives, and that means dealing with the messy, brutal reality of trauma. It’s not glamorous. It’s not neat. And it sure as hell isn’t forgiving. People bleed. People cry. And sometimes, people die. If you’re here looking for a comforting pat on the back, you’re in the wrong profession.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, her gaze locking on one resident who looked particularly pale. “Trauma doesn’t care if you’re tired, if you’re scared, or if you’re having a bad day. The only thing that matters is whether you can pull yourself together and do your damn job. Can you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding. The room was silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she said, her lips curling into a faint, predatory smile. “Because if you can’t, I’ll find out. And I’ll make sure you don’t get the chance to waste anyone else’s time or life  on your mistakes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any questions?” Agatha challenged, her gaze sweeping the room like a hawk surveying its prey. Not a single hand went up. She allowed a satisfied smirk to tug at the corners of her mouth before turning toward Rio. “Your turn, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin was slow and deliberate as she stepped forward, but before she could take the podium, Agatha leaned in close, her voice low and laced with challenge. “Let’s see if you can keep their attention without scaring them to death.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched a brow, her grin widening. “Scaring them? Oh, you’ve got that covered, Harkness. Don’t worry, I’ll soften the blow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted quietly, stepping back to lean against the wall, her arms crossed as she watched Rio with a sharp, assessing gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to the residents, her tone light and disarming, a stark contrast to Agatha’s cutting precision. “Good morning, everyone. I’m Dr. Vidal. Think of me as the good cop in this partnership.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned casually against the podium, her demeanor an almost alarming contrast to Agatha’s sharp-edged authority. She flashed a charming smile, one that immediately eased some of the tension in the room. “Good cop might be a bit generous,” she said. “But let’s just say I’m here to make sure Dr. Harkness doesn’t chew you up and spit you out on day one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A ripple of relieved chuckles spread through the room, and Rio let it hang for a moment before continuing, her voice taking on a steadier tone. “Now, just because I’m a little easier on the ears than Dr. Harkness doesn’t mean I’m any less serious about what we’re doing here. Trauma is chaos. It’s fast, unforgiving, and it demands nothing short of your absolute best every single time. If you can’t give that, it’s not just your pride on the line—it’s lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t interrupt, content to let Rio have her moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” Rio continued, her voice smooth and steady, “you’ve just been handed a reality check, and trust me, you needed it. Trauma is exactly as brutal as she says. But here’s the thing: it’s also where you’ll learn the most. Not just about medicine, but about yourselves. Who you are under pressure. What you’re capable of when it feels like the world is falling apart around you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze swept the room, lingering just long enough on a few residents to make them squirm. “And make no mistake, the world will feel like it’s falling apart. But you’re not alone in this. You’ve got us, and you’ve got each other. You’ll make mistakes. You’ll feel like giving up. But the ones who stick it out? They come out of this better, stronger, and ready to handle anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped back slightly, gesturing to Agatha with a small, knowing smile. “Now, Dr. Harkness and I might have different teaching styles—hers is a bit more… trial by fire. But we’re here for the same reason: to make sure you leave this certification as the best damn doctors you can be. And trust me, if you can survive her, you can survive anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked faintly, pushing off the wall where she’d been leaning. She stepped forward, reclaiming the space beside Rio. “And just to be clear,” she said, her tone clipped but with a subtle edge of humor, “when Dr. Vidal says ‘survive,’ she means it literally. Because if you can’t handle this, someone else will pay the price. And I’m not in the habit of tolerating people who crack under pressure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room seemed to collectively hold its breath as Agatha’s words hung in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” she continued, her tone softening just slightly, “we’re not here to terrify you…well, not entirely. But we are here to push you. Hard. Because this is the job. It’s messy, it’s exhausting, and sometimes it feels impossible. But it’s also the most important thing you’ll ever do. So, if you’re ready to work, to learn, to fight through every doubt and every failure, then congratulations—you’ve come to the right place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught Agatha’s eye briefly, her grin turning almost conspiratorial as she addressed the room again. “You’re lucky, really. You’re getting the best of both worlds, someone to scare you straight and someone to remind you why you’re here in the first place. But don’t think for a second that I’ll go easy on you just because I’m not yelling. You’ve got a lot to prove, and we’ll be watching.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let Rio’s words settle for a moment before straightening, her gaze sharp as ever. “The certifications start now. Break into your groups. I expect to see preliminary trauma assessments from all of you by the end of the day. If you’re not sure where to start—” She glanced at Rio, her smirk widening slightly. “Ask Dr. Vidal. She’s the nice one, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, muttering under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t bother hiding her satisfaction as the residents began to scramble into their assigned groups. The air buzzed with nervous energy, but also with purpose. And as she turned to head toward her workstation, she felt Rio’s gaze lingering on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio stepped back, she turned to Agatha with a wry smile. “Think that softened the blow enough?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, her tone dry. “We’ll see if they survive the day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning trudged on with back-to-back seminars, some led by them, others featuring invited specialists sharing their expertise. The sessions were intense and demanding, yet the real tension simmered beneath the surface. Agatha was acutely aware of Rio’s presence at every turn, like a magnetic pull she couldn’t seem to escape, even when they weren’t speaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By lunch, Agatha had reached her limit. She could feel her mind beginning to crack under  the weight of the day pressed down on her shoulders. She stood, brushing nonexistent crumbs off her blazer, and addressed the group with her usual calm, practiced detachment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned on her heel, heading toward the door when Rio’s voice called after her, laced with teasing amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leaving already? No lunch with the team? ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused but didn’t turn around, her back stiffening at the deliberate jab. “I prefer to eat in peace,” she replied coolly, her voice steady as steel. “Some of us don’t need a running commentary with every meal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room tensed, some of the residents exchanging awkward glances, but Rio simply laughed, the sound light but with an edge of challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Suit yourself, Harkness. But don’t complain later if you’re left out of the fun. I hear the catering’s pretty decent,” Rio quipped, leaning back in her chair with a knowing smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond. She stepped out of the conference room and let the door click shut behind her, the sound muffling the murmur of voices inside.She walked briskly down the hallway, her heels clicking loudly with each step, the tension in her chest tightening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that she didn’t want to spend time with Rio—it was more that she couldn’t handle it today. Not after everything that had happened between them, the mess that was still lingering under the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went straight to the nearest exit, ignoring the pang of guilt that followed her every step. She needed space. Just space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The afternoon dragged on, each seminar blending into the next like a series of monotonous slides on a PowerPoint presentation, but Agatha couldn't escape the feeling that Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>everywhere</span>
</em>
<span>. Every opportunity was a chance for Rio to mock, tease, or simply poke at Agatha’s carefully constructed veneer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they moved from one session to the next, Rio would occasionally sidle up next to Agatha, her voice just low enough for only her to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Dr Harkness” Rio said during a particularly dry lecture on trauma resuscitation, leaning in with a fake whisper. “What’s the trick to giving the perfect speech? I mean, you had them on the edge of their seats. I’m sure they’ll all be just as thrilled for the next round of trauma nightmares.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look, though she kept her cool. “I’m just trying to teach them what you can’t. How to scare the hell out of people without them running for the exit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, clearly amused. “Touché. But let’s be honest—your speech could’ve used more... showmanship. Maybe throw in some blood spattering, or a fake trauma dummy or two. You know, just to keep it interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sigh, resisting the urge to roll her eyes but failing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, when the group broke for a quick coffee break, Agatha found herself in line at the vending machine, trying to collect herself. Of course, Rio found her again, somehow managing to slip in just beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr Harkness, you’re looking a little tense. Too much ‘trauma’ talk for you?” Rio asked, her voice dripping with sweet venom. She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice to a mockingly sympathetic tone. “I mean, no one could be as cool as you under pressure. Right? You're the queen of ‘cool under fire.’"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. "I’m fine. But I’m sure you’re thriving in all this attention, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, nudging her playfully. “Thriving? Oh, sweetie, I live for this stuff. ” She gestured vaguely at the room, where the first-years were all looking at them with wide eyes. “These kids, they want to be like us. So calm. So collected. So... dispassionate. They’ll never survive in this field without a good dose of attitude. Just a heads-up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure they’ll get by just fine with less attitude,” Agatha retorted, her patience waning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the end of the day, the conference room emptied as the session officially wrapped up at seven. For most, it meant the end of a long day, but not for Agatha. The hands-on portion of the trauma certification loomed over her—tomorrow would bring grueling practical exercises. Tonight, though, there was still work to do. Staying behind meant prepping materials, arranging surgical tools, and setting up the simulation dummies. And, of course, it meant doing all of that with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was already heading back toward the conference room, her stride confident, her smirk firmly in place. She looked as though she was gearing up to turn the evening’s task into a personal challenge to test Agatha’s patience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t think you can escape just yet,” Rio called, her voice cutting through the quiet hall. She stopped and turned, catching Agatha mid-step as she inched toward the exit. “We’ve got work to do”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped in her tracks, her hand stilling on the strap of her bag. She turned, fixing Rio with a cool glare. “I wasn’t planning on running away,” she said evenly, though her voice carried just enough of an edge to warn Rio not to push her further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow, her grin widening. “Good. I’d hate to think you couldn’t handle a little prep work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, brushing past Rio and into the room without another word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stood outside the prep area a few minutes later, her nerves felt like taut wires ready to snap. The thought of being alone with Rio for the next few hours unsettled her. Guilt coiled tightly beneath her composed exterior, the kind that gnawed at her no matter how much she tried to push it aside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just guilt. Rio had a way of getting under her skin, of prying at vulnerabilities until they were laid bare. Agatha could already imagine the barbs Rio would throw, particularly about her and Stephen. The rumors swirling that they’d hooked up had followed Agatha everywhere. She hadn’t, of course, but no one cared to believe that. And Rio wasn’t the type to let such a ripe opportunity pass by unnoticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The cruel irony of it all wasn’t lost on her. Rio hadn’t even been around when Agatha left the bar that night. She was otherwise... occupied. In a way that still made Agatha’s skin flush uncomfortably.  The memory of that night burned in her mind, sharper than she wanted to admit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, the idea of being alone with Rio felt like stepping into a minefield. Every glance, every word, carried the potential to unravel her carefully maintained control, and she wasn’t sure if she was ready to face the fallout. She inhaled deeply, steadying herself before finally pushing open the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was already in the room, casually arranging the tools on a tray. Her posture was relaxed, but her eyes were sharp, flicking up to meet Agatha’s the moment she walked in. “You’re late,” Rio quipped, her voice carrying that trademark blend of amusement and challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set her bag down with deliberate precision, meeting Rio’s gaze head-on. “I wasn’t planning on running away,” she said evenly, slipping off her blazer and draping it over the back of a chair. “It’s just… nice to imagine one moment of peace. You know, before the chaos resumes.” Her tone was cool, but her movements were taut, betraying the tension she carried. “Some of us take this seriously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked and stepped closer, casually picking up a pair of surgical scissors and twirling them between her fingers like a baton. “Oh, I take this very seriously, Harkness. But let’s be honest, you’d rather be anywhere else right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t rise to the bait, focusing instead on organizing a stack of manuals. She slid a binder into place with a little too much force, the loud snap of the ring echoing in the quiet room. “Let’s just get this done,” she said sharply, pulling on her gloves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the table, watching her with an unhurried ease. “Fine by me,” she said lightly, though the gleam in her eyes told a different story.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched as they each turned to their tasks, though it wasn’t long before Rio broke it. She glanced toward the surgical dummies laid out in neat rows, the scalpels and tools gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. “Okay,” Rio mused, running her fingers lightly over a pair of surgical scissors. “I think I’ll take the head this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tone was casual, but her next words came with a teasing grin as she turned to Agatha. “What about you? You’re more of the… torso type, I assume?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a moment, the comment hitting her with an unexpected force. A flush crept up her neck, and she quickly turned her attention to a tray of tools, willing her hands to stay steady. “Let’s just focus on the prep,” she said curtly, refusing to meet Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened at Agatha’s reaction, but she didn’t press further—at least not yet. “Suit yourself,” she said breezily, but her gaze lingered, as though filing away the moment for later use.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them worked in relative silence for the next few hours, the calm of their shared task punctuated only by the occasional banter. Despite the tension lingering between them, Agatha couldn’t help but grudgingly admit that Rio was damn good at what she did. Even if her ego was insufferable, her hands moved with practiced precision, her instructions sharp and efficient.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they finished setting everything up, the room was nearly ready. The tools were in place, the dummies arranged, and the checklists completed. Agatha’s body ached from the day’s grind, her shoulders stiff as she straightened and glanced at the clock. It was almost ten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha said, stripping off her gloves and tossing them into the wastebasket with a sigh. “I’m going to try to get out of here before midnight. You know, some of us value our beauty sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her smirk softening into something almost genuine. “Well, if you need beauty sleep, that explains a lot. All this time, I thought you were just naturally like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, grabbing her blazer from the back of the chair. She slung it over her arm with deliberate ease, taking a moment to meet Rio’s gaze. “It’s cute how you think I need it,” she shot back, her tone laced with dry amusement. “But don’t worry, Vidal—if you stick around long enough, maybe I’ll share some tips. Heaven knows you could use a little polish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, leaning against the edge of the table. “Careful, Harkness. I might actually take you up on that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a pointed look, a ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. “Good night” she said, turning toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stepped into the cool night air, the tension in her chest began to ease, though only slightly. The quiet street offered a welcome reprieve, but her mind was anything but quiet. Rio’s teasing, her sharp eyes, and that maddening smirk lingered like the faintest echo of a song she couldn’t stop hearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all too much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, somehow, not enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next day, Agatha barely had time to collect herself after the chaos of yesterday. Her nerves buzzed with exhaustion and the usual sense of dread she felt when teaching something as intense as the surgical skills portion of the trauma certification. This wasn’t just a lecture; this was hands-on. This was the moment to see if the residents could cut it, and Agatha had no problem making sure they felt the weight of her expectations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood at the front of the room, her heels clicking against the sterile floor as she paced. Dressed in a fitted black pencil skirt and a crisp white blouse tucked neatly at the waist, she exuded an air of sharp authority. Her hair, loose for once, framed her face in soft waves that contrasted starkly with the icy determination in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents stood in a line, their eyes wide and nerves palpable, like electricity in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the silence hang thick before speaking, her voice cutting through the tension like a scalpel. “Today is the day you either step up or step out,” she said, her tone commanding and uncompromising. “This isn’t a classroom. This is where you learn what you’re made of. If you can’t handle the pressure—if you can’t put everything else out of your mind and focus solely on the patient—then maybe you should consider a different line of work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, scanning their faces. She could see the weight of her words sinking in, the nervous shuffling of feet as they braced themselves. Good. Nervousness made them sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if I see anyone freezing up today, if I see anyone hesitate even for a second, I will personally make sure you’re off this certification. Are we clear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was silent, save for the soft rustling of papers and a muffled cough. Agatha liked it that way. Silence meant they were listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she continued. “Because the only thing standing between you and an angry trauma surgeon on the other side of the operating table is your ability to act fast and without hesitation. Get ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned toward the row of surgical dummies set up along the side of the room. Her voice remained sharp as she barked instructions. “This isn’t just theory. These are real scenarios. You’re going to be tested, not just on textbook answers but on your ability to think on your feet, to feel the patient, and, most importantly, to get your hands dirty when the situation demands it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing off to the side, Rio watched, her arms loosely crossed, an amused smirk playing on her lips. She was dressed impeccably, as usual today in a tailored black suit paired with a white shirt left just undone enough to look effortlessly polished and white sneakers. The sharp lines of the suit made her look like she belonged in a high-fashion magazine instead of a trauma skills seminar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel Rio’s eyes on her as she finished her speech, and sure enough, Rio chimed in as the residents shuffled off to prepare. “You’re really giving them the full tough-love routine today, huh?” she teased, her voice light but her grin mischievous. “I don’t think you need to terrify them quite so much. I mean, they’re already scared of you as it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slowly, her eyes narrowing, though a flicker of a smirk tugged at her lips. “You’re one to talk, Vidal. You’d probably prefer to put them through a series of pop quizzes and call it ‘character building.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her gaze sparkling with humor. “I don’t know. I think they’d survive the quizzes. It’s the pressure that gets them.  You’re good at making them sweat, though. Definitely your strong suit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, brushing past Rio as she adjusted one of the dummies. “Some of us don’t believe in holding their hands,” she quipped, her tone dry. “But feel free to jump in with your charm offensive anytime. They’ll need it to recover after this.” She didn’t do soft encouragement, after all. Her philosophy was simple: if they couldn’t handle the heat, they didn’t belong in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned casually against a nearby table, her grin widening. “Oh, don’t worry. I wouldn’t dream of stealing the show from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned away with a faint shake of her head, but a small, exasperated smile crept across her face despite herself. Rio might drive her insane, but she had to admit—her banter was annoyingly effective at cutting through the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Refocusing, Agatha moved forward with the session. She stepped to the front of the room and began demonstrating a procedure. Her movements were sharp and efficient, the kind that came with years of experience and discipline. She didn’t bother explaining every minute detail; this was about showing, not coddling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio, predictably, couldn’t resist taking the opportunity to step in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, everyone, watch closely,” Rio said, sliding in front of Agatha with dramatic flair, a glint of mischief in her eyes. “Let’s see how Dr. Harkness manages the elbow reduction. It’s one of the more delicate procedures, and as charming as she is, she’s certainly no stranger to handling delicate things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a fraction of a second, willing herself to keep her composure as a faint blush threatened to rise. She forced herself to focus on the task at hand, but Rio’s words had landed squarely under her skin, as they always seemed to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stepping back, Agatha crossed her arms and watched, trying to ignore the heat creeping up her neck, as Rio demonstrated the reduction again. Rio placed her hands on the dummy’s elbow with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what they were doing, her voice calm and steady as she explained the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You see, the trick is to apply gentle pressure, enough to realign the joint, but not so much that you cause further damage,” Rio said, her hands moving with precision. “Don’t rush, but don’t hesitate either. If you panic, it only gets worse. Confidence is key. Feel the joint. Listen to how it moves. If you don’t, well...” She paused, flashing a quick grin at the wide-eyed residents. “Let’s just say, your patient won’t be thanking you later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents nodded solemnly, their eyes glued to Rio’s movements. Agatha, meanwhile, stood off to the side, the heat in her cheeks finally subsiding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything to add, Dr. Harkness?” Rio asked, glancing over her shoulder with an infuriatingly casual smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, stepping forward again. “No, I think you’ve thoroughly dazzled them with your theatrics. Now let’s see if they can actually do it themselves. Shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, stepping aside as Agatha moved to address the residents. Her tone was as sharp as ever, but Rio’s teasing had done something unexpected: it had broken the tension, and the group seemed a little more at ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if Agatha wouldn’t admit it, Rio’s knack for knowing just when to push her buttons and when to back off was annoyingly effective.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning was already crawling toward noon, and the day’s seminars were becoming more intense. Agatha’s mind buzzed with the usual flood of medical knowledge, but Rio Vidal’s presence was impossible to ignore. Agatha was no stranger to Rio’s teasing and constant banter, but today, there was a different energy between them, an undercurrent of tension that made her nerves hum. She tried to focus, tried to bury herself in the task at hand, but Rio seemed determined to make that impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it was time for Rio to demonstrate the reduction of a fracture, a procedure Agatha had done countless times. Still, when Rio stepped forward, something shifted in the air, and inside Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged off her tailored suit jacket with practiced ease, leaving her in a crisp white long-sleeve shirt. The fabric clung just right, outlining her toned frame and the subtle definition of her muscles. It wasn’t just the shirt, though, it was the way Rio moved, so effortlessly confident. Agatha’s breath hitched, but she forced her gaze back to the dummy, determined not to give Rio or her own racing thoughts the satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, everyone,” Rio began, her voice rich with that casual confidence that always set Agatha on edge. “Let’s go over how to reduce a fracture. Precision is key. You need to apply pressure in the right places, stay controlled, and above all, don’t rush..”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to Rio despite herself, drawn to the easy grace with which she set up the mannequin. Her hands moved with an assurance that made the procedure seem deceptively simple, her fingers finding the break on the dummy’s leg with precision. Everything about Rio felt like a performance unintentional, perhaps, but utterly captivating nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught her watching and smiled, a knowing curve of her lips that sent an unwelcome jolt through Agatha. “Pay close attention to this,” Rio said, her voice dropping just enough to feel intimate. “It’s a technique you’ll need in the field. Hands-on opportunities can be... unpredictable.” Her eyes locked with Agatha’s, and she winked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her stomach tighten, heat rising to her face. She clenched her jaw and straightened her posture, refusing to let Rio rattle her further. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer to the table, her movements smooth and deliberate. She took hold of the dummy’s leg, positioning it with practiced ease. “Now, the key is controlled pressure,” she explained, her tone shifting to something more professional. Her hands moved expertly along the mannequin’s limb, fingers pressing firmly yet gently into the break. “You need to feel for the alignment. Too much force, and you’ll cause more damage. Too little, and nothing happens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as Rio adjusted the dummy’s leg, her movements precise and fluid. But she couldn’t help but notice the subtle flex of Rio’s muscles beneath her shirt, the way the fabric stretched as she worked. It was maddening—this mix of professionalism and an almost unconscious magnetism that Rio seemed to exude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See?” Rio said, her voice breaking through Agatha’s scattered thoughts. She pressed down on the joint with just the right amount of pressure, aligning the fracture perfectly. “Controlled, deliberate, and confident. That’s the difference between a successful reduction and a nightmare for your patient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents murmured their agreement, clearly impressed. Agatha, on the other hand, forced herself to take a calming breath. Rio was good at what she did, she couldn’t deny that, but her flair for turning a routine demonstration into an unwitting spectacle was another matter entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day passed in a blur of mockery, teasing, and surgical precision. Agatha managed to have lunch on her own again, though she couldn’t shake the sense that Rio was always just one step behind, watching her, waiting for her to slip up, and enjoying every minute of it. Agatha told herself she didn’t care, that she was used to Rio’s games, but deep down, she knew the truth. The games weren’t just continuing; they were escalating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it came time for Rio to demonstrate the shoulder reduction, Agatha prepared herself to observe with the same clinical detachment she always maintained. She stood at the back of the room, arms crossed, her sharp gaze fixed on the residents as they gathered around the demonstration table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Alright, first-years," Rio’s voice broke through the low murmur of conversation as she stepped forward. Her tailored light blue suit moved fluidly with every step, commanding attention with an ease that made Agatha’s teeth clench. "Let me show you how to handle this. The shoulder dislocation is one of the most delicate injuries you’ll encounter. It’s about precision, confidence, and most importantly connection with your patient."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted, maintaining her place near the edge of the group, her eyes fixed on Rio. But when Rio’s smirk started to form, her amusement unmistakable, Agatha’s shoulders tensed. Whatever was going on in this infuriating woman's head couldn't be good for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, her dark eyes glimmering with mischief. "I think this is better to demonstrate with a real person and not just a dummy. Dr. Harkness, would you mind helping me out with this one?" Her smile was too knowing and entirely infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, her mind racing. Demonstrating meant Rio would have to touch her, guide her arm, and... She didn’t know how to feel about that. She felt a shiver down her spine for sure, though she’d die before admitting it. She hesitated for a moment, but the quiet in the room made it impossible to decline without drawing even more attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine," Agatha snapped, striding forward with a practiced air of indifference that masked the storm of emotions brewing inside her. "Let’s get on with it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached Rio’s side, standing tall, though she avoided eye contact. It wasn’t until she noticed Rio’s arched eyebrow and the suppressed laughter in her gaze that Agatha realized she was still wearing her blazer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you planning to let me work through the jacket?" Rio teased, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flushed, her cheeks burning as she fumbled to remove the blazer. "Right," she muttered, her tone clipped. "Happy now?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ecstatic," Rio said smoothly, her grin widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was silent, all eyes on the two of them, but Agatha’s mind was far from the other residents. Rio stepped closer, too close, her presence suddenly all-encompassing. When Rio gently took hold of Agatha’s arm to guide it into position, a jolt of warmth shot through her. Agatha’s breath hitched, her pulse quickening as she tried to keep her composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Now," Rio began, her voice soft but firm as her hand slid up Agatha’s shoulder, “the key to a successful reduction is pressure, just the right amount. You have to feel where the joint is, let it lead you. If you’re too rough, you’ll cause damage. If you’re too soft…” She let her words trail off, her fingers lingering on Agatha’s shoulder for just a moment too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, her body betraying her in ways she found infuriating. The warmth of Rio’s touch was electric, each point of contact sending a sharp wave of awareness through her. She forced herself to focus on the procedure, but the flutter in her chest refused to subside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand moved with controlled precision, her fingers brushing Agatha’s skin as she adjusted her arm. Every shift was deliberate, yet it felt intimate, like Rio was fully aware of how her touch lingered. When Rio finally applied the pressure, guiding Agatha’s shoulder “back” into place with a practiced twist, the closeness between them became overwhelming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You feel that?" Rio asked, her voice low and deliberate, her breath just barely brushing Agatha’s ear. "That’s the right amount of pressure. Just enough to get the joint back into place, no more, no less."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, nodding quickly. "I feel it," she replied, her voice more curt than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers remained steady, her gaze lifting to meet Agatha’s. Her eyes held an intensity that made Agatha’s stomach twist, equal parts exhilaration and dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Every patient is different," Rio continued, her tone softer now, almost intimate. "You have to listen to their body, feel what it’s telling you. If you can’t do that…" Her fingers pressed gently once more, sending a spark through Agatha. "...you’re in trouble."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The memory of Rio’s touch clung to Agatha long after Rio stepped back to address the residents. The ghost of her fingers curled around her like smoke, leaving Agatha acutely aware of how unsteady her breathing had become. She crossed her arms over her chest, desperate to regain control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Any questions?" Rio asked the group, her voice smooth, as though nothing unusual had transpired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room murmured in awe, but Agatha remained silent, unwilling to meet Rio’s gaze again. She knew Rio’s smirk would be there, infuriating and knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to ignore the way her body was reacting to Rio’s touch, the lingering heat that had no place in this room. It wasn’t just Rio’s proximity—it was the fact that everything she did was so... deliberate. Every glance, every shift of her body, felt calculated, and it was all so damn effective to infuriate her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Alright," Rio said, finally stepping back. "You get the gist. Now, who wants to give it a try first?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands were shaking slightly as she straightened up, trying to regain control of herself. She hated that she couldn’t stay unaffected, no matter how hard she tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the other residents started to step forward, Agatha felt a mix of relief and frustration. She couldn’t keep letting Rio get to her like this. She couldn’t keep letting Rio’s teasing and her touch, however innocent, disrupt her focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But deep down, Agatha knew that was easier said than done. Because Rio Vidal, with her easy confidence and effortless charm, was impossible to ignore. And right now, Agatha was finding that more frustrating than ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The afternoon stretched on, a blur of demonstrations and discussions, but for Agatha, the tension from earlier lingered like an annoying echo. She kept herself at the edge of the room, observing rather than participating, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. Rio, of course, was in her element. Charming, composed, and entirely unfazed by the undercurrent of tension between them. Was there even tension between them or was it just Agatha's imagination playing tricks? She wasn't completely sure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha busied herself with taking mental notes on the residents’ techniques, but her mind betrayed her, replaying the sensation of Rio’s touch, the way her voice had dipped into something almost too intimate. It had been professional and appropriate of course, and yet, it was all Agatha could think about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the day’s final session came to a close, Agatha didn’t bother sticking around to chat with the residents or exchange pleasantries with Rio. As soon as the last demonstration ended, she gathered her belongings and bolted from the room, her heels clicking sharply against the floor as she stormed down the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fluorescent lights overhead hummed softly as she made her way to the exit, desperate for fresh air, for space to think. Just as she reached the quieter stretch of the corridor, her phone buzzed in her pocket. Agatha yanked it out, her irritation simmering just beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes?" she snapped into the phone, not bothering to check who it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, hello to you too," came Nat’s familiar, amused voice. "Hi, Nat. How are you, Nat? Good to hear from you, Nat." There was a pause, and Agatha could practically hear the grin in Nat’s voice. "Rough day, or is that just your usual bedside manner?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pressing her fingers to her temple. "What do you want, Nat? I’m not in the mood for whatever this is."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Clearly," Nat replied, her voice light but laced with teasing. "I was calling to confirm I’m coming down for Nicky’s birthday on Saturday. I already booked my flight."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s frustration softened just slightly at the mention of her son, but her tone remained sharp. "Fine. I’ll see you then. But don’t expect me to roll out the red carpet."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat chuckled. "I wouldn’t dream of it. Though, judging by your tone, I’d say someone’s already gotten under your skin today. Care to share, or should I guess?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There’s nothing to share," Agatha snapped, walking briskly toward the exit. "Just a long day with incompetent first-years and... distractions."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Distractions, huh?" Nat’s voice was thick with mock curiosity. Then, in a sudden outburst, she began shrieking like a madwoman, "Wait- are you seeing someone?? And you haven't told me?? You little bitch!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze mid-step, the image of Rio flashing unbidden in her mind. "Don’t start, Nat. I’m not."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, I’m starting," Nat replied with a laugh. "Come on, Aggie. You've got that tone. You’re flustered. It's almost cute."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t call me that disgusting name. I’m hanging up now," Agatha said, her voice tight as she resumed her brisk pace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Okay, okay, You’re out of the hook… for now anyways" Nat relented, still laughing softly. "I’ll see you Saturday. Try not to bite anyone’s head off before then, yeah?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ended the call without another word, stuffing her phone back into her pocket. She reached the hospital’s main doors and stepped outside, letting the crisp evening air wash over her. It didn’t do much to cool the heat simmering just below the surface, but at least it was quiet out here—no teasing voices, no infuriating smirks. Just her, the night, and a desperate need to sort through the chaos in her head.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have any dreams that night. Not because her imagination was lacking, but because she didn’t sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>At all. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was one of those nights where her brain seemed hell-bent on torturing her. Every time she closed her eyes, Rio’s stupid, smug face appeared. That infuriating smirk. Those hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned and flipped onto her stomach, burying her face into her pillow like she could smother the memory out of existence. No luck. The ghost of Rio’s touch lingered on her arm, her shoulder, and, damn it all, even her wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was ridiculous. </span>
<em>
<span>Infuriating.</span>
</em>
<span> She wasn’t some lovesick teenager. She was a grown woman. A professional. A surgeon, for God’s sake! And yet, there she was, lying in bed, her heart racing over nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifted positions for the hundredth time, punching her pillow into submission before flopping onto her back again, glaring at the ceiling as if it held the answers. Why did Rio get under her skin like this? She was just so full of herself. </span>
<em>
<span>That was it</span>
</em>
<span>. She had to be. No one needed to smirk that much or invade someone’s personal space with such… warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Warmth?</span>
</em>
<span> Ugh. What was wrong with her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even like Rio. That much was clear. It wasn’t like she was sitting there thinking about how her eyes sparkled when she teased her or the way her voice dropped into that smooth, velvety tone. Nope. Not at all. Definitely not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up abruptly, her hair sticking out in every direction, looking as frazzled as she felt. "I’m losing it,” she muttered. “I need therapy. Or a lobotomy. Something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried reasoning with herself. She was irritated, that’s all. Rio was annoying. Her smirk was annoying. Her touch was… </span>
<em>
<span>ugh</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha buried her face in her hands, as if she could scrub the memory out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brain tried to whisper something at the edge of her consciousness, but she shoved it aside with the force of a hurricane. Nope. No. Absolutely not. Whatever her subconscious was trying to say, whatever weird feelings were creeping up they could stay buried. She wasn’t about to sit there analyzing why Rio made her feel… anything. Because she didn’t. She felt nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse quickened at the thought of Rio’s hands on her again, and she flopped back onto the mattress with a loud groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” she told herself firmly. “I feel nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Morning arrived far too quickly for Agatha, though “morning” was a generous term considering she’d spent the entire night wide awake, wrestling with her thoughts and losing spectacularly. The sun creeping through her curtains only served as a rude reminder that she had a full day ahead of her—a day that promised more time with </span>
<em>
<span>her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned, shoving herself out of bed with all the enthusiasm of someone heading to their own execution. Today, she’d need scrubs, which she pulled on begrudgingly. The soft blue fabric felt like a cruel joke. She hated scrubs. They were baggy, unflattering, and far too comfortable for someone in her current mood. What she needed was armor, something sharp and stiff to match her attitude. Instead, she looked like the poster child for “Exhausted Resident Chic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her reflection in the mirror wasn’t doing her any favors, either. Her eyes were shadowed with sleeplessness, her hair a tangled mess that she half-heartedly tamed into a bun. “Perfect,” she muttered to herself. “I look like I crawled out of a medical textbook on burnout.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Breakfast was a granola bar she barely tasted, washed down with a bitter coffee that didn’t come close to improving her mood. The thought of the day ahead soured her stomach further. It was the last day of the trauma certification, which should’ve been a relief. But the fact that it was also the last day she’d be forced to work so closely with Rio Vidal? That left her with a strange, unsettled feeling she refused to analyze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The certification finale promised to be grueling, a full-scale trauma simulation, complete with chaos, pressure, and the looming threat of public failure. It was the kind of thing Agatha usually thrived on, but today, she felt a simmering resentment bubbling beneath her skin. She was tired. She was irritated. And she was sick of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman had been a thorn in her side from day one, with her teasing, her smirks, her frustrating ability to make everything look so effortless. Agatha didn’t even know why Rio bothered her so much, only that she did. And after last night, after the memory of Rio’s touch refused to leave her alone, Agatha was in no mood to play nice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stalked out the door, her bag slung over one shoulder, her coffee cup clutched like a weapon. “One more day,” she muttered to herself, jaw clenched. “I just have to survive one more day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she thought it hard enough, maybe she’d start to believe it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She strode into the hospital with her usual briskness, though today her pace was more out of sheer determination not to collapse from exhaustion than any sense of purpose. The familiar hum of the hospital filled the air, but it only grated on her nerves. Her coffee cup, now empty, had done little to salvage her mood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned a corner and nearly bumped into Wanda and Mariah, both looking infuriatingly well-rested and cheerful. Wanda was mid-laugh at something Mariah had said, but her smile shifted into concern the moment she saw Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Agatha,” Wanda said, her brows knitting together. “Are you okay? You look...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like hell,” Mariah finished with a grin, unapologetic as she gave Agatha a once-over. “Did you sleep in a dumpster, or is this just a new look you’re trying out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot Mariah a withering glare, though she didn’t have the energy for a proper retort. “I’m fine,” she muttered, brushing past them toward the elevator.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah, of course, wasn’t done. She fell into step beside Agatha, her grin widening. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, the whole ‘disheveled genius’ vibe could work for you. But the bags under your eyes? Those are doing a little too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, refusing to rise to the bait. “Some of us have real work to do, Mariah. Not all of us can waltz in looking like we stepped out of a skincare commercial.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah gasped theatrically, clutching her chest. “Ouch. Someone didn’t get their beauty sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough,” Wanda cut in gently, though there was a hint of amusement in her tone. She turned to Agatha as the three of them waited for the elevator. “I wanted to ask about Nicky’s birthday tomorrow. Do you need help with anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off by the shift in topic. “Uh, yes. I mean, no. I’ve got it handled,” she said, a little more sharply than intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled patiently, unbothered by Agatha’s tone. “Okay. Let me know if you change your mind. I can bring something if you need extra snacks or decorations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Thanks, Wanda, but it’s fine”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it's the guy from the bar coming?” Mariah said, her eyebrows lifting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a warning look as the elevator doors slid open. “Don’t start,” she snapped, stepping inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah smirked, stepping in after her. “Who, me? I wouldn’t dream of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just shook her head with a small smile, following them into the elevator. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then. And try to get some rest tonight, Agatha. You’ll need your energy with all those kids running around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha mumbled something noncommittal, leaning back against the elevator wall as it began to ascend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed open the door to the conference room, her exhaustion already fraying her patience. She expected to find the usual chaos of first-years milling about, but instead, the room was quiet, save for the infuriating presence of Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood at the far end of the room, casually leaning against the table, clipboard in hand. She was dressed in red scrubs that, Agatha noted with immediate annoyance, fit her too well. The color popped against her dark complexion, her posture exuded confidence, and her hair was tied back just enough to reveal sharp cheekbones that should have been illegal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated it. She hated that Rio looked that good in scrubs. She hated that she even noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And most of all, she hated the stupid smirk Rio wore as she looked up and caught Agatha glaring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice carrying that maddeningly smooth lilt. “Sleep well?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened, and she set her bag down with more force than necessary. “Like a baby,” she deadpanned. “What’s on the agenda today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you’re going to love it,” Rio replied, setting the clipboard down and straightening up. She walked toward Agatha with the kind of ease that only made her presence more grating. “We’re taking this certification outside. Field simulation. Realistic conditions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, trying not to look directly at Rio and her annoyingly good-looking scrubs. “Outside? It’s freezing. And it’s about to rain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Rio said with a grin, clearly enjoying Agatha’s growing irritation. “Trauma doesn’t wait for sunny days, Harkness. Time to see how everyone handles a little adversity.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, glaring. “This is a teaching hospital, not SEAL training.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, completely unfazed. “Think of it as a chance to test your limits. Or theirs,” she added, gesturing vaguely toward the door where the residents were beginning to gather.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could fire back, Rio leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to something almost conspiratorial. “Besides, I’m curious to see how you handle it. You’re not one to back down from a challenge, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks burned, though she told herself it was from irritation. “I’ll handle it just fine, thank you,” she snapped, brushing past Rio toward the group of residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, she heard Rio chuckle softly, the sound low and infuriatingly pleasant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the group began to shuffle out of the conference room and toward the hospital’s outdoor training area, Agatha caught sight of the darkening sky. The clouds were heavy and gray, and the sharp smell of impending rain hung in the air. It was going to be a miserable day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was only making it worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group filed outside into the chilly, overcast air, their breath visible in the cold. Agatha hugged her arms close, wishing she’d brought a thicker coat. Rio, on the other hand, seemed impervious to the elements, standing at the head of the group clipboard in hand, looking far too energized for the circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen up!” Rio’s voice cut through the chatter, immediately silencing the residents. Her tone was sharp and commanding, leaving no room for argument. “A charter plane was forced into an emergency landing and collided with a passenger bus. Mass-casualty situation. Thirty victims. Critical injuries. Your job? Stabilize them, prioritize their transport, and get them on the evac helicopter. Do I need to say it again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group collectively blinked, some of the younger residents shifting nervously. Agatha crossed her arms, her irritation boiling just beneath the surface. She didn’t like the way Rio’s voice seemed to hold everyone’s attention, herself included.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “No? Good. Let’s move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She led them toward the training area, her red scrubs vivid against the gray of the impending storm. Agatha followed, muttering under her breath as Rio opened the back of an ambulance loaded with supplies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached the designated area, the group came to a halt. Scattered across the muddy field were thirty mannequins, each grotesquely detailed to simulate trauma injuries, gaping wounds, fake blood, broken limbs twisted at impossible angles. The sight drew a collective groan from the residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, clearly enjoying herself. “Welcome to the final test of your trauma certification.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” Agatha muttered, glaring at the macabre scene. “This is exactly how I wanted to spend my day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored her, addressing the group. “You’ll work in teams of six. Each team is responsible for nine casualties. You may treat your patients using only what you can carry in your two hands from this ambulance. The evac helicopter is on its way. If your patients aren’t stable enough for transport, they don’t make it. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents shuffled uneasily, their nerves visible. Agatha, however, was already bristling, her lack of sleep and Rio’s insufferable energy combining into a potent mix of frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Teams are color-coded,” Rio continued, pointing to a nearby assistant who was handing out colored tape to divide the group. “The clock starts now. Get your supplies, get to work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The residents hesitated for a beat too long, and Rio clapped her hands. “Move! People are dying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group sprang into action, scrambling to the ambulance for supplies. Agatha reluctantly grabbed her own gear, scowling at the mud that clung to her shoes. Just as she was about to join her assigned team, Rio appeared at her side, her expression irritatingly calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excited to show off those skills, Dr. Harkness?” Rio asked, her tone teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare. “Thrilled,” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit back the dozen scathing retorts on the tip of her tongue storming toward one of the teams to supervise. Behind her, she could hear Rio’s chuckle, low and maddeningly self-assured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rain started as a light drizzle, the cold drops soaking into their scrubs as the residents began to triage the dummies. Agatha focused on her assigned residents. This day was going to be miserable, and Rio was somehow both the cause and the aggravating highlight of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rain was coming down harder now, turning the training field into a muddy, chaotic mess. Residents scrambled to keep their “patients” dry, but the relentless downpour wasn’t making it easy. Agatha, standing off to the side with Rio, scowled under the hood of her raincoat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, on the other hand, looked entirely too pleased with herself. She clapped her hands once, drawing the attention of the beleaguered residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time check, people!” Rio’s voice carried over the rain. “It’s been three hours. Where’s your evac helicopter? Oh, that’s right. It’s not here yet. What’s your plan, hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the younger residents, clearly panicking, stammered, “We were keeping them stable—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stable?” Rio cut in, her tone mockingly incredulous. “Is that what you call hypothermic mannequins lying in the mud? Because from where I’m standing, they look dead. And if they’re dead, guess what? No certification for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, glaring at the chaos. “Do you have to enjoy terrorizing them so much?” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to her with a grin. “Funny coming from you Dr. Harkness. It’s education with flair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the field, one resident, Smith, had improvised rain gear using a trash bag meant to keep the mannequins dry. Bishop, ever the rule-follower, looked horrified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice raincoat, Smith,” Agatha called out, striding over. “But shouldn’t you be more concerned about keeping your patient dry?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smith, unfazed, shrugged. “Well, they’re dummies, and I’m a person, so…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She raised an eyebrow, clearly enjoying this. “Interesting logic. But here’s a fun fact: a dry patient is less likely to die of hypothermia or shock. Something to think about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bishop immediately ripped the trash bag off Smith and used it to cover her mannequin. “There you go, little guy. No hypothermia for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smith threw up his hands. “Are you crazy? I’m soaked now!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the point, Smith,” Rio said, smiling devilishly. “Adapt. Improvise. You think trauma doesn’t involve getting a little wet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nearby, another resident groaned loudly. “We’ve lost two patients! This rain is impossible!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, her grin widening. “Oh, look. Green team’s casualties are stacking up. Only Blue team and Red team left in the running. Let’s see who survives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose as she watched Rio revel in the residents’ misery. The tables had turned completely—Rio was the one having fun, and Agatha was the one stewing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re enjoying this way too much,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk was unrepentant. “Come on, Harkness. Admit it. Watching them flounder is a little satisfying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, but her scowl deepened. Watching Rio lead the chaos with such flair was infuriating—and somehow distracting in ways she refused to examine too closely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright!” Rio called out, clapping her hands again. “Blue team, you’re about to lose another patient if you don’t stop bickering. Red team, let’s see if you can keep your last two alive. Clock’s ticking, people”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at the stormy sky and sighed. It was going to be a long, wet day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ripped off her gloves and tossed them into the nearest bin, her patience threadbare. The rain was relentless, soaking through every layer of clothing, and the entire ordeal had stretched far beyond what she deemed reasonable. She spotted Rio barking orders to a flustered resident and made her way over, her shoes squelching in the mud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m done,” Agatha said flatly, her tone brooking no argument. “I’m heading back to the hospital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely glanced at her, a smirk playing on her lips. “Oh, come on, Harkness. The day’s not over yet. You don’t want to miss the grand finale.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tightened her jaw, gripping the edges of her rain-soaked jacket. “I’ve had enough of your ‘grand finale,’ Vidal. I’m leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel, her shoes squelching in the mud as she marched toward the trauma bay doors in the distance. The rain lashed against her face, her hair clinging uncomfortably to her forehead, and her scrubs were a second skin, soaked and clinging with every step. The storm outside felt mild compared to the tempest of irritation roiling inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Rio’s voice rang out behind her, muffled slightly by the rain. “Harkness, wait up!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t slow her pace, her irritation mounting. The last thing she wanted was Rio trailing after her. But, of course, the woman was relentless. Agatha heard the rapid footsteps splashing through the mud and resisted the urge to roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you really running away because you’re wet?” Rio said as she caught up, her red scrubs somehow still managed to look infuriatingly good even drenched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go back, Vidal,” Agatha snapped, tugging her jacket tighter around her. “I don’t need an escort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were almost to the trauma bay doors when it happened. Agatha’s foot hit a particularly slick patch of mud, her boot skidding out from under her. Her arms flailed, her balance gone in an instant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, for—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could hit the ground, Rio lunged forward, reaching out to catch her.  But the mud betrayed them both. Rio’s grip faltered, and with a startled yelp, she fell forward, landing squarely on top of Agatha with an audible thud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment the world seemed to freeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rain poured down around them, but neither of them moved. Agatha lay on her back, her breath caught somewhere in her chest, utterly paralyzed by the proximity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s weight pressed into her, warm and solid, anchoring her to the mud-soaked earth. Agatha’s pulse thundered in her ears, and she was acutely aware of every point of contact—the curve of Rio’s knee brushing her thigh, the press of Rio’s hand firm on her waist. Her own hands were trapped awkwardly between them, her palms against Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was Rio’s face, close enough that Agatha could count the raindrops clinging to her dark lashes, could see the faint hitch in her breath. The rain had plastered Rio’s hair to her forehead, stray strands dripping water onto Agatha’s cheek. Her scent—something clean and sharp, mixed with rain—filled the small space between them, intensifying the strange, dizzying heat building in Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you—” Rio started, her voice quieter than usual, almost uncertain. The confidence that typically saturated her words was missing. She swallowed, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brain short-circuited, caught somewhere between mortification and an inexplicable awareness of how Rio’s hand had landed on her waist, her cheeks burning despite the chill of the rain. “I—yes,” she stammered, her voice a little too loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, her expression a mixture of amusement and something else—something that made Agatha’s pulse race against her will. “You’re welcome, by the way. For trying to save you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t save me,” Agatha snapped, pushing at Rio’s shoulders. “You fell on me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laugh was low, warm, and infuriatingly genuine. She shifted, her hand sliding slightly as she braced herself to stand. “Technically,” she said, her tone maddeningly playful, “I cushioned your fall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could shove Rio off her, a familiar voice sliced through the downpour like a blade, dripping with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, isn’t this interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her stomach dropping faster than her footing had earlier. Her head snapped toward the source, and there she was. Natasha standing a few feet away, a wicked grin plastered across her face and her phone held up, screen glowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, God no,” Agatha groaned, every ounce of blood in her body rushing to her face, her voice thick with mortification as she shoved at Rio, trying to dislodge her.“Put that fucking phone away now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it was too late. Natasha’s thumb clicked, and the unmistakable sound of a picture being taken pierced the rain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still sprawled on top of Agatha, tilted her head to look at the intruder, her smirk returning as though it had never left. “Friend of yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s response was immediate. “Get off me!” With a surprising burst of strength, she shoved Rio sideways, sending the other woman rolling into the mud with an indignant laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scrambled to her feet, her dignity hanging by a thread. “What are you even doing here?” she snapped, brushing futilely at her scrubs. “You’re supposed to arrive tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, unbothered by the rain and the glare being sent her way, pocketed her phone with the satisfied air of someone who had just struck gold. “I was going to wait until tomorrow to make my grand entrance, but I thought, hey, why not surprise my dear Aggie?, get a sneak peek at the new glamorous life of Dr. Harkness you know” She grinned, ignoring Agatha’s groan of protest at the nickname. “Imagine my delight when I get to the hospital, and they tell me you’re out here in the mud. And then I find this,” she added, gesturing to the now-seated and mud-streaked Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to Rio, still lounging in the mud as though it were a chaise lounge. “Oh, relax, Aggie.” Nat clapped a hand on her shoulder, ignoring her flinch. “I came for Nicky’s birthday, remember? But if I’d known there’d be mud wrestling involved, I would’ve brought popcorn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fumed as she stomped toward the hospital, muttering curses under her breath, her soaked scrubs clinging uncomfortably to her. The humiliation of the fall still burned her cheeks, and she couldn’t shake the sensation of Rio’s weight pressing her into the mud. Her skin tingled where Rio’s hand had accidentally (or so she hoped) landed on her waist. It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, Rio climbed to her feet, shaking mud off her hands and smirking at Natasha, who was grinning like a cat that had just cornered a mouse. “I’m Rio by the way,” she said, extending a mud-streaked hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha took the hand without hesitation, her grin widening. “Natasha Romanoff. Nice to meet you, Rio”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Likewise,” Rio replied, glancing slyly at Agatha, who shot them both a death glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gestured toward the muddy field behind them. “So, what exactly is going on here? Did you drag Aggie into some kind of outdoor wrestling match?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s trauma certification,” Rio explained with a chuckle. “Simulated mass-casualty training. Lots of mud, fake blood, and dramatic yelling. Pretty standard stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s eyes lit up with mischief. “Sounds like fun. I’m always up for a challenge. Mind if I join?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spun around, her jaw practically hitting the floor. “You’re not joining, Nat. You’re going back to my office with me. Better yet, we’re going home. ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, come on, Aggie. You’re just mad because you fell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not mad because I fell,” Agatha hissed, though her tone betrayed her lie. “I’m mad because you’re here causing chaos when you’re supposed to be arriving tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha ignored her, turning back to Rio. “By the way, I’m a surgeon too. So, this is kind of my thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an impressed eyebrow. “A surgeon? Interesting. What’s your specialty?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neurosurgery,” Natasha replied smoothly, clearly enjoying Agatha’s growing irritation. “This sounds like a walk in the park compared to some of the real-life mass casualties I’ve dealt with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her hands up in frustration. “You can’t just insert yourself into a certification, Natasha! That’s not how this works.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha placed a hand dramatically over her heart, feigning hurt. “You’re an awful person you know. Here I am, offering to help out your colleagues and contribute my expertise, and you just want to drag me away like a tyrant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, clearly enjoying the spectacle. “I think she’s got a point, Harkness. We could use an extra pair of hands, especially one with her credentials.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, we couldn’t,” Agatha snapped, crossing her arms. “Nat, you are not staying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Natasha had already turned toward Rio, her grin practically sparkling. “Lead the way, doctor. Let’s see what you’ve got for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked at Agatha one last time before gesturing toward the makeshift field hospital. “You’ll need scrubs for this,” she said, her tone lightly teasing as she gestured to her own mud-streaked outfit. “Follow me. Let’s get you geared up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, left fuming in the middle of the trauma bay  muttered under her breath, “Unbelievable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose as the two women walked off together, chatting like old friends. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was her personal hell. And it was still raining. Perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rain hammered down relentlessly, plastering everyone’s hair and scrubs to their bodies. Agatha stood a few feet away from the chaos, arms crossed, her scowl deepening with every passing second. She didn’t know what annoyed her more: the rain soaking through her clothes, or the sight of Natasha and Rio leading the trauma drill like a well-oiled machine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, the red team’s patients have all died,” Rio called out, her voice slicing cleanly through the storm. She turned toward the blue team, her soaked red scrubs somehow still managing to make her look composed. “Only the blue team remains. Keep an eye on Smith. That’s what resourcefulness looks like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha chimed in, her tone dripping with faux sympathy. “Oh, don’t worry. Resourcefulness isn’t contagious. You’re safe.” She smirked, brushing a stray piece of wet hair off her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, clearly amused. Agatha, watching from the sidelines, felt her stomach churn. </span>
<em>
<span>They’re supposed to hate each other. </span>
</em>
<span> Natasha was her best friend. Rio was her... </span>
<em>
<span>nemesis? Torturer? What even was Rio?</span>
</em>
<span> Whatever the label, the woman had no business bonding with her best friend like this. And yet, here they were, completely in sync, their shared laughter adding salt to Agatha’s wounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crouched by one of the blue team’s dummies, examining the incisions. “Good effort, Avery,” she said, her tone calm but firm. “But this incision is too wide. You lacerated the superior thyroid arteries.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jackson groaned, his frustration evident. “Well, I just—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Move on,” Rio interrupted, standing and wiping rain from her face with an air of finality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn it!” Jackson muttered under his breath as he begrudgingly complied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hear it,” Bishop suddenly piped up, her eyes scanning the stormy sky. “I hear the helicopter!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jackson whipped around, incredulous. “You what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—I—I hear it! I hear it!” Bishop insisted, almost jumping in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, wake up!” Smith shot back from across the mud. “You don’t hear the helicopter because, ‘a,’ it’s imaginary, and ‘b,’ the imaginary helicopter is never coming!” He threw his arms up in exasperation. “They’re trying to break us! Teach us some B.S. lesson about how trauma isn’t fair or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not done until they say these dummies are dead. The end!” Bishop retorted, her desperation bordering on manic. She was relentless, Agatha had to give her that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not true!” Smith snapped. “It’s over! You’re just too stubborn to admit it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could hardly believe the chaos unfolding in front of her. She wanted to storm over and tell Natasha and Rio to wrap it up already. But no, Natasha was too busy reveling in her new role as co-leader. And Rio? She seemed to be thriving, her smirk firmly in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind whispered the truth she didn’t want to face: </span>
<em>
<span>This is your fault.</span>
</em>
<span> Natasha didn’t even know about Rio. She hadn’t told her. She had thought it unnecessary, even petty. Now she could see how wrong she had been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her spiraling thoughts were interrupted by Jackson, who threw his hands up in frustration. “Screw this. I’m done,” he declared, abandoning his dummy and stomping toward the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s sharp gaze locked on him. “Avery, where are you going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m done!” he shouted over his shoulder, not bothering to turn back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Rio challenged, raising a brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, </span>
<em>
<span>ma’am!</span>
</em>
<span>” Jackson shot back sarcastically before disappearing into the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gave an approving nod, completely unfazed by the outburst. “That was bold. Completely stupid, but bold.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s frustration bubbled over. She gritted her teeth, the rain masking the heat of her fury. She didn’t know how much more of this she could take.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands balled into fists at her sides. She hated this. Hated how seamlessly Natasha and Rio worked together, how they communicated without hesitation, without any of the usual tension Agatha felt whenever she was near Rio. It felt like a betrayal, though Agatha couldn’t quite explain why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched, her eyes narrowing, as Natasha and Rio moved around the patients, so in sync, so </span>
<em>
<span>together</span>
</em>
<span>—as if they’d been working as a team for years. Agatha wanted to tear her eyes away, but she couldn’t. It was like some sick punishment her mind had created. It felt like they were united against her, and the worst part was—she couldn’t do a damn thing about it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This is ridiculous,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought. </span>
<em>
<span>I can’t even be mad at them.</span>
</em>
<span> And yet, she was. She was furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rain continued to pour, unrelenting, as the chaos reached its peak. Natasha stood at the edge of the scene, arms crossed, soaked to the bone but completely unfazed. Rio, equally drenched but just as composed, kept pace with Natasha’s energy, barking orders at the remaining trainees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mam! You said the helicopter was gonna be here hours ago,” Bishop shouted, still performing CPR on her dummy. “And it’s not here, and I’m not complaining, but where is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Natasha, who shrugged theatrically. “Rain’s still bad,” Rio said, her voice steady despite the storm. “Probably got caught in a hailstorm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” Bishop muttered. She suddenly shot a look at Natasha fumbling with a card. “No! No! I know what that card is gonna say!” she exclaimed. “It’s gonna say he has cardiac tamponade with associated hypotension and bradycardia, but he can’t, 'cause I already did a pericardiocentesis and bolused him with I.V. fluids.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat, holding the card mid-air. “She’s right. What do I do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grab his feet!” Bishop barked, spinning to Smith, who sighed but complied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood off to the side, her irritation mounting. She wanted to laugh at how ridiculous the scene had become, but the way Rio and Natasha managed to maintain their authority and composure grated on her nerves. They weren’t just good at this—they were </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> good. It made her feel like an outsider in her own disaster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bishop and Smith picked up their dummies and started hauling them toward the ambulance, splashing mud everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Natasha called out, stepping forward to cut them off. “What do you think you’re doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bishop was undeterred. “This ambulance is in play!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Oh, it is, is it? I must’ve missed that memo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is now,” Bishop snapped, climbing into the driver’s seat. “Seven of my patients may have died today, but these two won’t!” She gripped the wheel dramatically. “And I’m gonna take them to that hospital right there!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trainees froze, uncertain whether she was bluffing. Rio sighed and stepped back, shaking her head. “Fine. Let’s see where this goes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exchanged a glance with Natasha, who was clearly struggling not to burst out laughing. “This ambulance was in the accident,” Rio said, trying to maintain some semblance of order. “It doesn’t run.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bishop turned the key in the ignition, and the engine roared to life with a defiant growl. “Guess AAA can get here faster than your imaginary helicopter. Now move, or I’ll run you down!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trainees froze, their faces a mix of shock and confusion, unsure whether Bishop was bluffing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, stepping back with an exasperated shake of her head. “Fine. Let’s see where this goes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a split second, Agatha found herself wishing Bishop would go through with it and just nudge Rio out of her way. Nothing major, of course, just enough to take her down a peg. It was a fleeting, petty thought, but damn, it was satisfying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident slammed on the gas, splashing through the mud as the ambulance sped toward the ER entrance. She leaned out of the window. “John Doe, multiple chest and extremity traumas! Still hypotensive despite two large-bore I.V.s started in the field!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Natasha jogged behind, their exasperation barely concealed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bishop, that’s enough,” Agatha finally called out, stepping forward as the trainees cheered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The young resident was unfazed. “Call the OR and make sure there’s a room available!” she shouted, still in full character.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smith turned to Rio. “Will you just tell her she won already? She’s never gonna stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed dramatically. “Fine. Blue team wins. Happy? Your patient lives for 40 years, has 15 grandkids, and a beach house in Malibu. Can we call it a day now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” April jumped out of the ambulance, hugging Smith. “Yes, yes, yes!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched the scene unfold, finally allowing herself a small sigh of relief. Her personal hell was over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha walked over, her grin wide. “Well, that was fun. Who’s up for round two?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “You have got to be kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, brushing rain-soaked hair out of her face. “Oh, come on, Harkness. You've got to admit it was fun”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, her wet scrubs clinging to her as she trudged toward the hospital. She didn’t wait for them. She stormed ahead, her boots squelching against the rain-soaked ground as she made her way to the hospital’s changing rooms. The storm outside was nothing compared to the storm brewing inside her. Her personal hell was over—for now—but the fact that Natasha and Rio had somehow turned it into a bonding experience left her fuming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She yanked open her locker, peeling off her soaked scrubs with a force that nearly tore the fabric. Mud and rain had soaked through to her skin, and the cold clung to her like a second layer. Agatha wasted no time, stepping into the shower and letting the hot water rinse away the grime.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio and Natasha finally sauntered in, Agatha was already changed into a clean pair of hospital scrubs and her expression set in a grim scowl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, look who decided to ditch us,” Natasha said, her voice dripping with faux hurt as she tossed her drenched jacket onto a nearby bench.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, her damp hair falling into her eyes as she unbuttoned her soaked red scrubs. “She’s a runner, Nat. Gotta get used to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat??</span>
<em>
<span> how dare she.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at both of them, crossing her arms tightly across her chest. “Oh, don’t even start with me. You two were having the time of your lives back there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you weren’t?” Rio teased, tossing her scrub top onto the bench. “You looked like you were having fun, Harkness. In a ‘storming off dramatically’ kind of way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fun?!” Agatha snapped, her voice rising. “You call that fun? Mud, rain, and two hours of watching the two of you get along like you’re best friends? No, thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha chuckled, unzipping her jacket. “Don’t be so dramatic, Aggie. We’re not best friends.” She paused, glancing at Rio. “Yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Give it time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out an exasperated groan, grabbing her bag. “I’m waiting for you in my office. We’re going home as soon as you’re done.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha raised an eyebrow. “And where exactly is your office?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darted to Rio, who was in the middle of stripping off her muddy scrub pants. She sighed, her patience hanging by a thread. “She can show you,” she said curtly, slinging her bag over her shoulder and making her way to the door. “Try not to get lost.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the bench, watching Agatha’s retreating back with a sly grin. “She’s fun when she’s mad, isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha chuckled as she unzipped her own boots. “Oh, you have no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, hearing their laughter echo behind her, muttered a curse under her breath and quickened her pace. </span>
<em>
<span>Why couldn’t they just hate each other like normal people?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly made it to her office before Mariah intercepted her in the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Mariah said, stopping short. She looked Agatha up and down, her expression hovering somewhere between concern and amusement. “You look like you got run over by a truck. Twice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Thanks, Mariah. Always a pleasure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah grinned unapologetically. “Truce?” she offered, holding up her hands in mock surrender. “How about I make it up to you with a coffee? You look like you need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, realizing her usual sharp retort wouldn’t get her far. “Fine. Coffee sounds good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, the two of them were sitting in Agatha’s office, steaming cups in hand. Mariah was chatting about some hospital gossip, and Agatha was just starting to relax when the door swung open with a flourish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your coffee smells like dishwater,” Natasha announced as she entered, her voice dripping with mock disdain. She looked infuriatingly effortless despite the chaos of the day, her damp red hair cascading over her shoulders, and her hospital scrubs fitting far too well for Agatha’s liking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finally. Took you long enough,” Agatha said, her tone sharp as her eyes flicked to Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha ignored her entirely, her gaze locking on Mariah. Her lips curled into a smirk. “And who’s this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah blinked, caught off guard by Natasha’s sudden attention. “Uh, Mariah,” she said, glancing at Agatha as though for guidance. “Mariah Hill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha stepped forward, the smirk evolving into a warm, undeniably charming smile. “Mariah Hill. Strong name. I like it,” she said, extending her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah hesitated but eventually shook Natasha’s hand. “Nice to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned inwardly, already bracing for disaster. “Nat, this is Mariah. Mariah, this is Nat. There. Introductions done,” she cut in briskly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Natasha turned to Agatha with mock indignation. “You could at least try to make me sound interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Agatha said through gritted teeth. “Mariah, this is Natasha. She’s an irritating, overly dramatic surgeon who’s currently a pain in my ass”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha ignored the jab, turning back to Mariah with a conspiratorial grin. “She’s always like this when she’s stressed,” she said, her tone dropping ever so slightly, smooth as silk. “But I’m sure you’ve already figured that out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah stifled a laugh, her cheeks pinking slightly. “Oh I've gathered that”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, feeling her annoyance bubble dangerously close to the surface. “Okay, we’re done here,” she snapped, standing abruptly. “Nat, let’s go. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shot Mariah a lingering glance as she followed Agatha to the door. “It was lovely meeting you, Mariah,” she said with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked down the hallway, Agatha's annoyance radiated off her in waves. “You couldn’t help yourself, could you?” she snapped, her eyes narrowing at Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Natasha asked, her tone a mix of amusement and innocence that made Agatha want to scream. “I was just being friendly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Friendly,” Agatha echoed, her voice dripping with disbelief. “You were flirting. And on top of that you don’t even know if Mariah is into women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha stopped walking, a grin spreading across her face as if Agatha had just delivered the punchline to a great joke. “Oh please” she said, shaking her head in mock pity. “Sweetheart, Mariah is about as straight as a rainbow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “What? How would you even know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha tilted her head, giving Agatha an incredulous look. “Oh, seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood there, Eyebrow raised, arms crossed, waiting for an explanation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha sighed theatrically, as if explaining the obvious to a child. “Did you see the way she looked at me? It was practically a neon sign. Honestly it’s adorable how clueless you can be sometimes. You’ve been my best friend for how long? You should know how to read these things by now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, rubbing her temples as if that might somehow make Natasha disappear. “You’re impossible. And why do you always have to flirt with everyone? It’s infuriating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s smirk widened, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Because it makes life more fun, obviously. Besides,” she added with a wink, “you’re cute when you’re mad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped dead in her tracks, her glare icy enough to freeze lava. “I’m serious, Nat! One day, your endless flirting is going to get you into trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha just laughed, throwing an arm over Agatha’s shoulder as they resumed walking. “Trouble’s what keeps life interesting, Aggie. You should try it sometime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they made their way through the hospital corridors, Natasha fell into step beside Agatha, her trademark smirk firmly in place. “So, about that trauma certification…” she began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t,” Agatha warned, her tone sharp but not without humor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t what?” Natasha asked, her voice dripping with mock innocence. “Congratulate you on your stellar performance? Or tease you about how you managed to look like a drowned cat by the end?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, glaring at her. “Both. Especially the second one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha chuckled, her eyes twinkling. “Fine, fine. But let’s not forget. you owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her annoyance flaring. “Owe you? For what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked, her expression far too pleased with itself. “For coming all the way here to rescue you from your post divorce hermit lifestyle. And, of course, for not abandoning you after you decided to go completely MIA.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled, ready to fire back, but something about the way Natasha said it, half teasing, half serious made her pause. She sighed, her shoulders dropping. “I already said I was sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apology accepted!” Natasha announced brightly, spreading her arms wide. “Now, where’s my hug?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes so hard it was a wonder they didn’t get stuck. “You’re unbelievable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“True,” Natasha agreed with a smug grin. “But I’m also right here, arms open. Come on, Aggie. You owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite herself, Agatha felt the corners of her mouth twitch upward. “Fine. But if anyone sees this, I’ll kill you. Slowly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha beamed, triumphant. “Deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without giving herself time to overthink, Agatha stepped forward and let Natasha wrap her arms around her. The embrace was warm and firm, grounding her in a way she hadn’t realized she needed. For a moment, the chaos of the day faded into the background. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In Natasha’s arms, Agatha felt her turmoil slow, her walls cracking just enough to let in the comfort of familiarity. She allowed herself to lean into it, into her best friend, into a feeling of home she hadn’t felt in forever. Nat held her tightly, and for the first time in what felt like ages, she felt herself exhale fully, as if she’d been holding her breath for months.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If anyone sees this,” Agatha muttered against Natasha’s shoulder, “my reputation is ruined.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha laughed softly, the sound vibrating against her. “Oh, please. Let them talk. You’re hugging the hottest person in the hospital. It’ll only make you look good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, unable to help herself. “You’re delusional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Natasha said, leaning back just enough to grin down at her. “But I’m also your best friend. And you’re stuck with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time all day, Agatha felt herself relax completely. “Lucky me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Natasha said, giving her a final squeeze before letting go. “Now, let’s go home before you start crying and ruin your reputation even more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nat!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Natasha was already walking off, laughing to herself, her victory cemented.</span>

<p>
<span>As they made their way to the car, Natasha, still grinning from her victorious hug, shot Agatha a sideways glance. “So, how’s the kiddo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled open the passenger door and slid inside, sighing as the warmth of the car’s interior started to thaw her rain-soaked skin. “Spending the night with his dad, he's picking him up from his figure skating lessons right now,” she muttered, shoving her wet hair back from her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha had just buckled her seatbelt when she froze, her grin vanishing. “Wait—Daniel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, bracing herself. “Yes, Natasha. Daniel. His other parent. Remember him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s fingers tightened around the steering wheel, her usual playful energy darkening into something sharper. “Yeah, I remember him. I also remember what a shit-show he put you through.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, tilting her head back against the seat. “Not this again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, this again,” Natasha snapped, turning to face her fully. “You let him take him overnight? Are you serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, already regretting saying anything. “I didn’t let him. We have a custody agreement, and he’s his father. He has every right to spend time with him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha scoffed, shaking her head as she turned the key in the ignition. “Sure, sure. But where was that fatherly devotion when he was too busy wrecking your life to be a decent parent?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Nat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just saying—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car was filled with tense silence as Natasha pulled onto the road, her grip on the wheel still too tight. The rhythmic sound of the windshield wipers and the patter of rain against the glass did little to ease the weight pressing down on them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha's irritation didn’t seem to dissipate as she drove, her eyes fixed ahead, her lips pressed in a thin line. The longer the silence stretched, the more Agatha felt the suffocating weight of it. She couldn’t escape it, not now. Her mind was already racing with a thousand thoughts—Daniel’s return, Nicky’s excitement, and Natasha’s mounting frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, Natasha exhaled through her nose, her voice quieter but no less frustrated. “I just don’t trust him, Ags.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms over her chest, staring out at the rain-blurred city lights. “Yeah, well. Neither do I. But Nicky loves him, and it was his birthday wish. You’ll see him tomorrow and we’ll spend all weekend together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That admission seemed to take the fight out of Natasha—at least for now. She glanced over, eyes softer, but Agatha didn’t meet them. Instead, she stared out the window, watching the streets rush by, feeling the dull ache in her chest settle in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet between them thickened, filled only by the hum of the engine and the steady drum of the rain. Agatha's thoughts were scattered, consumed by the unsettling weight of her past with Daniel and the uneasy future that loomed ahead. The tension in the car mirrored the knot in her stomach—tight, unyielding. Natasha's palpable anger hung in the air, unspoken but clear. The storm outside seemed to match the storm inside, with no signs of easing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha drove, her fingers still white-knuckled around the wheel, the silence between them stretched, thick and heavy. The rain continued its relentless assault against the windshield, the wipers swiping furiously as if trying to erase the tension in the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel Natasha staring at her, could sense the anger radiating off her in waves. It was only a matter of time before she exploded. She knew that look all too well—the one that preceded Natasha’s impatience giving way to something sharper, something more vocal. Agatha braced herself, knowing that Natasha wouldn’t be able to hold her tongue for much longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel Natasha staring at her, could sense the anger radiating off her in waves. It was only a matter of time before she exploded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, predictably—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t tell me that asshole was coming,” Natasha said, her voice razor-sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, already exhausted. “I didn’t think I had to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha let out a sharp, humorless laugh. “Oh, you didn’t think you had to?” she repeated mockingly. “You let him—that asshole—come all the way from New York for Nicky’s birthday and didn’t think to give me a heads-up?” Her grip tightened on the steering wheel as she leaned forward slightly. “Are you kidding me, Agatha? After everything he’s put you through, you’re still playing nice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched, but she kept her gaze fixed on the road, willing herself to stay calm. “It’s not that big a deal, Nat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a big deal?” Natasha’s voice rose, incredulous. “Daniel is a lying, self-absorbed piece of shit who treated you like an afterthought the entire time you were together, and now you’re just letting him waltz back in? He’s playing the perfect dad for a weekend, and you’re okay with that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath, her hand gripping the steering wheel tighter. “He’s his father, Nat. He has a right to see him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right?” Natasha spat. “Right? That’s rich, Agatha. Where the hell was that fatherly devotion when you were practically raising Nicky on your own? When you were busting your ass at work, barely holding it together, while he was off screwing his student and telling you he was ‘finding himself’?” Natasha’s voice dripped with disgust. “Finding himself? More like finding someone to screw while you’re left to pick up the pieces.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flinched, the old wounds reopening. Natasha had always despised Daniel, but now her fury was sharper, more personal. She could feel the anger in Natasha’s words like a physical blow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He wants to be in Nicky’s life,” Agatha said, trying to keep the emotion out of her voice. “And Nicky wants him there. It was his birthday wish, Nat. What was I supposed to do? Tell my son no?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s laugh was bitter and incredulous. “Tell him no? Damn right, you should’ve. Because he’s not some dad-of-the-year material. He’s a fucking joke. He doesn’t get to just come in and play the hero because it’s convenient for him. He never earned that right.” Natasha’s voice dropped lower, tinged with pure venom. “God, I hate him. I hate how he waltzed in like nothing happened, acting like you owe him something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her own anger flaring. “You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t hate that I had to watch Nicky’s face light up every time he sees him, knowing damn well Daniel hasn’t earned a damn thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha scoffed, shaking her head in disbelief. “And now he’s picking him up from figure skating?” she said, her tone almost mocking. “What’s next, huh? He’s moving to Minnesota? Suddenly he’s the perfect co-parent? Don’t make me laugh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curled into a bitter smile. “Oh, don’t worry. He’s not moving here. I made that very clear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course you did,” Natasha muttered, her voice laced with sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence in the car thickened once again, settling heavily between them. The rhythmic sound of the rain hitting the windshield only served to amplify the tension, and Agatha could feel the familiar weight in her chest, the ache of unresolved anger and frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long moment, Natasha exhaled sharply, her voice quieter but still holding an edge. “I just don’t want you or Nicky to get hurt again,” she said, her concern cutting through the anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, her throat tight. “We won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha didn’t look convinced. “I mean it, Ags. The second he fucks up—again—the second he makes Nicky cry, I swear to God I’ll make him regret ever thinking he could play the part of the dad again. I will fucking kill him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled weakly, trying to deflect the emotion rising in her chest. “Noted, Nat. I get it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha glanced over at her, still furious but softening a little. “You better, because if that asshole pulls any shit, I won’t let him off easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twisted into a tired smile. “I know. I know you won’t.” She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to ignore the ache in her chest, the constant tug of old emotions, both anger and pain, that Daniel had left behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Next time,” Natasha muttered, her grip on the steering wheel tight again, “you tell me when that bastard’s coming into town. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” Natasha’s voice was dark, but there was a flicker of something softer beneath it. “Because if he even thinks about hurting you or Nicky again, I will tear him apart. And I don’t care if I have to go to prison for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a chuckle, closing her eyes for a moment. “Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Natasha muttered, gripping the wheel tighter. “Because if he pulls any shit, I will kill him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a tired chuckle, closing her eyes for a moment. “Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a tired laugh, the sound carrying both weariness and a sense of resignation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as they pulled into Agatha’s driveway, Natasha was already unbuckling her seatbelt before the car had fully stopped. The rain had finally started to let up, but the wind was still howling through the trees, rattling the windows of the house as they stepped onto the porch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second Agatha unlocked the door, Natasha strolled in like she owned the place. “Ah, home sweet home,” she announced dramatically, kicking off her shoes and flopping onto the couch like a cat that had just discovered a new sunspot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow, watching her with a mixture of amusement and annoyance. “You do realize you don’t live here, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha stretched out, her arms behind her head, looking up at the ceiling like she’d never noticed it before. “You say that, but I don’t believe you.” She patted the cushion beside her. “Come on, Harkness. Join me in the land of comfort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head as she peeled off her damp jacket and tossed it over a chair. Natasha was so comfortable it was actually annoying—like a cat that had just waltzed into a new house and immediately claimed it as her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“First time seeing the place, Nat?” Agatha asked dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha hummed, pretending to take in the room with exaggerated admiration. “I’m really seeing it for the first time,” she said, her voice full of faux wonder. She paused dramatically, then turned to Agatha, dead serious. “When did you get that?” She pointed at a framed painting on the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You got that for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I?” Natasha gasped, placing a hand over her heart like she was shocked to remember. “Wow. Incredible taste. No wonder you’re so insufferable with your high standards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. “God, you are so exhausting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha grinned, unbothered, as she sprawled even further across the couch, now taking up an entire section. “You love me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a vague, noncommittal noise as she headed toward the kitchen. She’d grown used to Natasha's chaotic brand of comfort—because, somehow, it made her feel at home too. But at this moment, she was just trying to ignore the fact that her friend had already claimed her space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha followed closely behind, moving with the enthusiasm of someone who had never met a boundary they didn't want to cross. “So,” Natasha said, hopping onto the counter like a teenager who had no concept of personal space. “What are we doing tonight? We have a kid-free night, and as much as I love Nicky, I refuse to waste it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the fridge, rummaging around for something to drink, pretending she didn’t hear the not-so-subtle hint. She grabbed a bottle of water and twisted the cap off. “I don’t know, Nat. I was thinking of just—” She hesitated for a fraction of a second before continuing, “—crashing early. I barely got any sleep last night. My shift ran long at the hospital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a lie. A bold-faced, shameless lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t slept last night, but not because of work. No, she’d spent the night thinking—about other things. Thoughts she didn’t want to acknowledge. Memories she definitely didn’t want to linger on. But there was no way in hell she was telling Natasha that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s eyes immediately narrowed, her gaze sharp and calculating. “Bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced but didn’t dare look at her, knowing Natasha would see right through the half-hearted attempt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bullshit” Natasha repeated, crossing her arms. “You might be able to lie to other people, but not to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, turning away to grab a water bottle. “Believe what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I </span>
<em>
<span>will</span>
</em>
<span>.” she said slowly  “And I believe you’re </span>
<em>
<span>hiding something</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swatted her hand away. “I’m just tired Nat”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on,” Natasha said, hopping off the counter and getting into Agatha’s personal space, a look of suspicion painted on her face. “You think I didn’t notice the haunted look in your eyes when we were driving here? You’ve got that ‘I’m-not-talking-about-it’ vibe, Harkness. Spill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at the ceiling, as though the very paint might have a solution for her. “Really, Nat, it’s nothing. Just… stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stuff?” Natasha raised an eyebrow, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You’re not a damn robot, Agatha. ‘Stuff’ doesn’t keep you up all night unless it’s something big. What, did you remember you accidentally killed your pet hamster in sixth grade? Did you break the only mirror that’s ever agreed with you and now you can’t live with yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her an incredulous look. “That’s… incredibly specific. And no, I didn’t kill any hamsters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, well, just tell me the real story then,” Natasha said, crossing her arms. “Because, honestly, if you say ‘stuff’ one more time, I might just have to pull up a chair and interrogate you in the most dramatic way possible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the corners of her lips quirked. “You are so ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love it.” Natasha winked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, leaning against the counter, her posture exhausted but amused. “Fine, I’ll tell you. But only if you promise not to stage some dramatic intervention.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I make no promises.” Natasha grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze shifted downward, unable to fully meet Natasha’s. “I’ve just been thinking… about a lot of things. Things I can’t really talk about right now. But that’s why I’m crashing early. I don’t want to think anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha softened a little, noticing the change in Agatha’s demeanor. “You sure you don’t need something a little stronger than water for that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, managing a weak smile. “Yeah. But I’m good. I’ll figure it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha stared at her for a moment, then nodded as if she accepted the answer, even if it didn’t fully satisfy her. “Alright, alright. But next time, don’t lie to me, Harkness. I’m getting good at spotting that bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled lightly. “Noted, detective.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gave her a long, scrutinizing look, then sighed dramatically. “Fine. You win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Wait, what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You heard me,” Natasha said, throwing her hands up. “I’m allowing you to win this round. But only because you look like you’re about ten seconds away from face-planting onto the floor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Gee, thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha pointed toward the hallway. “Go. Sleep. Doctor’s orders.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “You're incredible”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm a doctor,” Natasha countered. “and I know things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “and I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha grinned. “I know. Now go sleep before I carry you to bed myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, but Natasha just raised an eyebrow, daring her to push her luck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Fine. But if you steal my blankets, I will smother you in your sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked. “Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha finally trudged toward her bedroom, she heard Natasha calling after her—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sweet dreams, Aggie!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha muttered a string of curses under her breath, but even as she flopped onto her bed, she couldn’t help but feel the ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned as she stirred, her body heavy with sleep. She blinked blearily at the ceiling, disoriented. What time was it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached for her phone on the nightstand. Nothing. Frowning, she patted around the sheets, coming up empty. Great. Probably lost it in the mess of blankets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With another groan, she sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. That’s when she noticed it—her closet light was on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She frowned. Had she left that on? She didn’t remember. But she was still in her ugly, damp hospital scrubs, which meant she had passed out the second she hit the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dragging herself up, she shuffled toward the closet, grumbling under her breath. “If this is another one of Natasha’s pranks, I swear to—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped inside—and immediately wished she hadn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha was standing there, casually rummaging through her things. But that wasn’t the problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The problem was that Natasha was basically naked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was wearing a transparent red dress—if it could even be called that. The sheer fabric clung to her, exposing everything, and Agatha’s brain short-circuited as she took in the fact that Natasha’s only attempt at modesty consisted of a thong and the transparent red fabric of what couldn't be called a dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gawked. “Natasha. What the fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha turned around at the sound of her voice, completely unbothered. And, unfortunately, the front wasn’t any better. The dress was completely transparent as the back and she was wearing tiny star-shaped nipple covers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus Christ, put something on!” Agatha yelped, throwing a hand over her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha rolled her eyes, clearly amused by Agatha’s reaction. “Relax, prude. It’s just a dress.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is not a dress,” Agatha spluttered, her voice rising in disbelief. “That is a war crime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked, striking a pose with exaggerated flair, completely oblivious to Agatha's shock. “You like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! I mean—” Agatha made a strangled noise, turning around so she wasn’t facing her directly. She planted a hand on her forehead as if that would somehow shield her from the sight. “Why are you even wearing that in my closet?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha sighed, her voice casual as if this was an everyday occurrence. “I’m going out. Didn’t want to wake you up, but I was looking for those boots I got you for your birthday a few years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth dropped open as she processed the statement. “You’re kidding. You’re seriously wearing that—” she gestured to Natasha’s barely-there outfit, “—to go out in public?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Natasha tossed her hair over her shoulder as she rummaged through the boots with a nonchalant air, completely ignoring the fact that Agatha was standing there, a mix of horrified and confused. “You know me, I like to make an entrance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An entrance?” Agatha echoed, unable to contain a disbelieving laugh. “This is a crime scene, Nat. I don’t even know where to start with you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shrugged, still rifling through the closet, as if this entire exchange was no more exciting than picking out a pair of shoes. “Hey, it’s called fashion. You wouldn’t understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes nearly rolled back into her head. “Fashion? You’ve lost your mind. You’re wearing... that,” she gestured again, “and calling it fashion?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha met her eyes with an exaggerated pout. “You’re just jealous because I’m pulling it off better than you ever could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “No one’s pulling anything off in that outfit, Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sure. Keep telling yourself that.” Natasha winked, clearly having fun with Agatha’s discomfort. “By the way, can I borrow those boots or what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After that? You’re lucky I’m letting you breathe in my house right now.” Agatha was starting to feel like she needed a drink—or a nap—just to process this whole situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take that as a yes,” Natasha grinned, throwing her hands up in mock surrender. “I’m just going to borrow them for a couple of hours, don’t worry. They’ll be back in your closet before you even notice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear to god, you’re insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha just gave her a lazy smile. “Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard that before.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, the absurdity of the situation still sinking in. “Wait. Which boots? You've gifted me a lot of those. The ones I never wore?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha paused mid-rummage and shot her a pointed look, her lips curling into a knowing smile. “Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned just enough to see Natasha pointing an accusatory finger at her. “I spent good money on those boots, Harkness. And now I know for a fact that you’ve never worn them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because they’re impractical as hell!” Agatha defended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha scoffed. “They’re Prada.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re obnoxious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They have spikes, Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what makes them hot!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, rubbing her temples. “So you broke into my closet, half-naked, just to steal them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Borrow,” Natasha corrected. “It’s not stealing if you never use them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “You know what? Fine. Whatever. Take the damn boots. Just—” she waved vaguely at Natasha’s sheer excuse for a dress, “—for the love of </span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>, put on a jacket or something before you give the entire city a free show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha grinned. “Aww. Are you </span>
<em>
<span>concerned</span>
</em>
<span> about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m concerned about public decency laws.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha chuckled, grabbing the boots and slinging them over her shoulder. “You’re cute when you’re flustered, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally found the boots and sat down on the floor to put them on, still fully unbothered by her scandalously sheer outfit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t stop shaking her head, feeling completely out of her depth. “You’re lucky we’re friends, Nat. That’s all I’m saying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love me.” Natasha shot her a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed dramatically, already used to Natasha’s ridiculous antics, though that didn’t make them any less shocking. “Not after this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liar.” Natasha shot back, adjusting her boots and standing up, ready to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a moment, a mix of exasperation and disbelief on her face. “I really need to start locking my door at night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s the fun in that?” Natasha grinned, slipping out of the closet with the same nonchalance she entered with. “Besides, you know you love the chaos I bring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was too tired to argue. Instead, she turned back to the bed and flopped down with a dramatic groan. “Whatever. Just don’t come back here crying when your ‘fashion statement’ gets you arrested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, please. It’s not a crime, it’s an art form,” Natasha called out from the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha winked before sauntering past her, completely at ease. “Sweet dreams, Aggie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shut her eyes, inhaling deeply before muttering, “I need a fucking drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Natasha strutted toward the bedroom door, boots slung over her shoulder like some sort of victorious thief, Agatha suddenly frowned. Wait a damn minute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold on,” she said, narrowing her eyes. “It’s your first day in this city. You don’t know anyone. Who the fuck are you going out with?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha hesitated for exactly one second before smirking. “Oh, you know. Just… people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, not buying it for a second. “What people?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s smirk widened. “Fun people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that’s when it clicked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eye twitched. “Oh, fuck no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s grin was downright wicked. “Oh, fuck yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going out with Vidal,” Agatha stated flatly, her soul leaving her body as she processed the awful, terrible truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha didn’t even try to deny it. “And Mariah, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, running a hand down her face. “I hate everything about this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't start” Natasha said cheerfully, seemingly undeterred by Agatha’s misery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pointed an accusing finger at her. “She’s bad news.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha snorted, clearly amused by the outburst. “Says the woman who fell on top of her in the mud. You looked really comfortable with her on top of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was gravity’s fault! And I wasn’t—” Agatha sputtered, but Natasha wasn’t having it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shrugged, unfazed, clearly enjoying the discomfort she was causing. “Look, Rio invited me out, and I wasn’t about to say no to free drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s buying?” Agatha asked, though she already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” Natasha said with a wicked smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dragged her hands through her hair, suddenly feeling ten times more exhausted. “I can’t believe you’re actually doing this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Natasha raised an eyebrow, genuinely curious. “She looks fun, Aggie. You just need to let go a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let go?” Agatha shot back. “You know she’s got some crazy agenda, right? She doesn’t do anything without wanting something in return.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, please. What’s she gonna do? Start a cult?” Natasha laughed, not a hint of worry in her voice. “Honestly, I’m just in it for the free booze and the people-watching. I’m not looking for anything deep here, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Agatha sighed, sinking back onto the bed in resignation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha tossed her hair over her shoulder and flashed her a cheeky grin. “ I can handle myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, so can she,” Agatha muttered under her breath, watching Natasha as she adjusted her outfit for the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, stop worrying. Nothing’s going to happen. It’s just a night out. We’ll have fun, and I’ll be back before you know it.” Natasha winked and turned toward the door, her voice drifting back to Agatha as she reached for the handle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even try to respond. The idea of being anywhere near Rio and Mariah tonight was the last thing she wanted to think about. “Just don’t do anything stupid,” she finally said, already half asleep again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated that Rio had that effect on people. Even Natasha, with all her stubborn confidence, was already being swept up into whatever charm Rio and Mariah exuded. And Agatha could see it coming—a night full of half-truths, flirtations, and games. She just hoped Natasha could keep her head straight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But knowing Natasha… Agatha sighed again and closed her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cursed under her breath. That woman was infuriating. And now she was infuriating Natasha's problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, sensing her internal struggle, grinned and patted Agatha’s cheek. “Aw, don’t be jealous, Aggie. There’s room for you, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swatted her hand away. “Jealous of you? Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Natasha said easily. “Then come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Nat, I’m exhausted. I just—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha threw up a hand. “Bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked. “You told me you were exhausted because of a hospital shift, but I know you, Harkness. If that were true, you’d have showered the second you got home. Instead, you passed out in your gross scrubs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed. Shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha’s grin was predatory. “Which means whatever kept you up last night had nothing to do with work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared. “You’re annoying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re deflecting,” Natasha sing-songed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “Fine. Whatever. You’re still going out with a menace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shrugged. “Eh. I like ‘em dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gagged. “You have terrible taste in people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shot her a pointed look. “I’m literally best friends with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled. “Touché.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha clapped her hands together. “Great! Now that you’ve agreed to come—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t agree—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—go shower before you smell up the bar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her hands in the air. “Oh my god!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha ignored her. “I’ll pick out something hot for you to wear. Don’t worry, I know you have no taste.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, dragging herself toward the bathroom. “I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I regret waking up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t,” Natasha called as Agatha shut the bathroom door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From inside, Agatha let her head fall against the cool tile wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This night was going to be a disaster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a long, hot shower, hoping the steam would cleanse not only the grime of the day but also the lingering, unwanted memories of Rio's body pressed so close to hers. She scrubbed harder than necessary, desperate to rid herself of the uncomfortable thoughts swirling in her mind. As the water rinsed off the last of the soap, she closed her eyes, trying to push everything else out of her head—everything except the comforting rhythm of the water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally stepped out of the shower, the steam curling around her like a fog, she grabbed a towel and wrapped it around her body, still feeling slightly disoriented. She didn't even bother drying her hair, knowing she'd be too lazy to style it properly. She put it in a high ponytail and hoped for the best. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then, as she was finishing up, she heard a sound—something between a groan and a dramatic sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, almost expecting it. Sure enough, when she opened the bathroom door, there was Natasha, sprawled across her bed as though she lived there, twirling a lock of her hair and giving her a lazy smile. The dramatic sigh she let out the second she laid eyes on Agatha wasn’t lost on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Took you long enough,” Natasha said, not even looking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, stepping into the room. “I was showering, not summoning demons,” she quipped, clearly not in the mood for one of Natasha’s theatrical rants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha tilted her head, suddenly looking too perceptive for Agatha’s liking. “Debatable. You looked like you were fighting some serious thoughts in there,” she said, voice laced with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for just a moment. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she muttered, refusing to engage in a conversation about Rio. Not today. Not now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved toward her vanity, grabbed her makeup bag, and started dabbing on the foundation. The contour was quick, and the mascara even quicker. She barely had time to appreciate her efforts when Natasha suddenly appeared next to her, grinning like a mischievous cat who had just found a mouse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,  I didn't find anything fun in your closet so you're using some of my clothes. Behold!” Natasha announced, throwing her arms wide like she was about to unveil the Mona Lisa.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward her, already bracing for whatever wild idea Natasha had come up with this time. What she wasn’t prepared for was what Natasha had in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There, in front of her, was a true crime against fashion—an outfit so ludicrous Agatha’s first instinct was to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha beamed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha stepped aside with a dramatic flair, presenting the first piece of her “outfit” like it was a prized possession. “White leather shorts,” she announced proudly, holding them up to Agatha’s face. “Short, but classy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ll barely cover my ass,” Agatha deadpanned, staring at the tiny shorts in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha ignored her completely, picking up the next item from the pile. “A deep blue bralette—sexy, but not trying too hard.” She held it up, as though this was the most reasonable clothing option in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms. “I refuse to be out in public with that little fabric covering my dignity.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, but wait! There’s more!” Natasha declared with a flourish, as though she were about to reveal the grand finale. She pulled out a sheer, long-sleeve t-shirt in the same shade of blue. “A sheer, long-sleeve t-shirt, in the same shade. Because I know you, and if I didn’t give you sleeves, you’d spontaneously combust.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to stay calm. “Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is no universe in which I wear this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha tilted her head, her eyes narrowing with mock contemplation. “Oh, really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really,” Agatha said firmly, refusing to give in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha tapped her chin, pretending to think hard about the situation before grinning wickedly. “Hmm. Well, that’s unfortunate because the club has a dress code.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eye twitched. “A what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A dress code,” Natasha repeated sweetly, enjoying this far too much. “Mariah told me. If you want to get in, you have to look the part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “What kind of place are you dragging me to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha simply grinned. “A fun one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran a hand down her face in sheer frustration. “Then why the hell aren’t you wearing this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gestured to her own outfit—one that looked like it belonged on a stripper. “I already have my outfit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, staring at her incredulously. “You are literally wearing stars on your nipples.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet, somehow, I am the one making better life choices tonight,” Natasha replied with a smug grin that made Agatha want to hit something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was about to argue again when Natasha turned around and grabbed something from the floor, lifting it in both hands like it was the Holy Grail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also, these,” Natasha said, practically glowing with mischief, her eyes gleaming with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squinted, then immediately regretted it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>White. Thigh-high. Leather. Boots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…You’ve got to be kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “I’m not! And you should be honored because these are one of my favorite ones I’ve gifted you. And oh surprise—you’ve never worn them either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For good reason,” Agatha muttered, already feeling a headache coming on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha sighed dramatically, placing a hand over her heart as if deeply wounded. “Do you know how insulting it is to give someone a gift and have them hide it in the back of their closet like a dirty secret?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought they were a joke,” Agatha said flatly, crossing her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gasped like Agatha had just slapped her mother. “Excuse me? These are designer, Harkness. DESIGNER.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are also ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are sexy as hell, and I cannot believe you’ve been sitting on these like some kind of style-deprived gremlin,” Natasha said with a mock pout, clearly disappointed in Agatha’s refusal to appreciate the sheer genius of her gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just stared at the boots for a moment longer, then gave Natasha a long, heavy sigh. “I can’t. I can’t do it. I’d rather face the wrath of a thousand awkward social interactions than wear that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha rolled her eyes, dropping the boots onto the bed with a flourish. “Fine. Be boring. But don’t come crying to me when you see all the fun you’re missing out on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, already exhausted. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Natasha grinned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave up, pulling her towel tighter around her shoulders. “I’m too tired for this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Natasha said casually, flopping back onto the bed with the kind of ease that only Natasha could manage. “But it’s still happening, and you’re coming with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. There was no escaping Natasha once she had an idea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, rubbed her temples, and reevaluated all of her life choices. “You’re enjoying this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, immensely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’re wasting your time because I am not going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shrugged. “Alright, fine. You can stay home. Alone. While I go out drinking with your friends”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s entire body stiffened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhh,” she crooned, “so you do care.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha batted her lashes. “I invited you, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha hummed, tapping her chin dramatically, then finally dropped the act. “Fine”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled so hard she saw stars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, you can either stay here and stew about whatever’s got you in a mood, or you can come out, have a drink, and show everyone in this city that you are a whole damn catch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lowered her hands. “I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Also, you’re not letting me go alone with your friends. Be serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eye twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked, knowing she had her. “Shower’s already done. Makeup’s already on. Put. On. The. Shorts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her. Then at the outfit. Then at the boots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…If I wear the boots, do I get to pick a different top?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha clapped her hands in victory. “You’re gonna look so hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am going to haunt you when I die.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat on the edge of her bed, staring at the sheer atrocity of an outfit laid out before her like it was a contract with the devil.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could still say no. She could still throw on some sweats, order takeout, and call it a night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the thought of Natasha—her Natasha—spending the evening alone with Rio Vidal?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach twisted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What were they, anyway? Agatha and Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Coworkers? Hardly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Enemies? Not exactly </span>
</p><p>
<span>A problem?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if there was one thing Agatha hated, it was being out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could spiral too deep, she yanked open her nightstand drawer and pulled out a flask of tequila she kept there for emergencies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And this? This was a goddamn emergency.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She unscrewed the cap and took a long, burning sip, feeling the warmth spread through her veins, loosening the edges of her nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright” she muttered to herself. “Just get it over with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could talk herself out of it, she stripped off her towel and got dressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The white leather shorts were so tiny they might as well have been made for someone half her size. They sat high on her waist, hugging her hips like they were painted on, and when she turned to the side, she saw entire portions of her ass that had never seen the light of day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The deep blue bralette was scandalous in a way that made her want to commit crimes. It dipped low between her breasts, offering zero coverage, and the sheer, long-sleeve t-shirt over it did absolutely nothing to hide the fact that she was one wrong move away from indecent exposure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the boots?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The goddamn boots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>White, thigh-high, skin-tight leather, the heels so high they should be illegal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood in front of the full-length mirror, stunned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely recognized herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her high ponytail gave her an air of sharpness, her makeup—simple but sculpted—made her look dangerous, and the outfit?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It screamed confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It screamed trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It screamed not a single man alive could handle me, so don’t even try.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly, gripping the edge of the dresser to ground herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When had she become this person? This reckless, impulsive woman who wore indecent outfits, drank straight from a flask, and made life choices based on petty jealousy?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t have time to think about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the door swung open, and Natasha strode in like she owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took one look at Agatha and whistled low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled. “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Natasha stepped closer, grinning like a wolf. “Are you kidding me? You look hot as fuck”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms over her chest. “This is the worst thing I’ve ever worn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha smirked, tilting her head. “That’s funny, because it looks like you were born to wear it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her, but before she could snap back, Natasha gently spun her around to face the mirror again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously,” Natasha murmured, standing just behind her. “Look at yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time in forever, she saw something she hadn’t in a long time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman who wasn’t drowning in her past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman who wasn’t just a mother, or a doctor barely trying to keep it together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman who hadn’t been left behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked dangerous. She looked desirable. She looked like she could ruin someone’s life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…Still think you’re not going?” Natasha teased, eyes gleaming in the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed dramatically. “Let’s just get this over with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha beamed. “Atta girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Uber pulled up to the curb, and as soon as Agatha stepped out, she was hit by a wave of humid Minnesota night air. It clung to her skin, thick with the scent of rain-soaked pavement, the sharp sting of cigarette smoke, and a faint hint of perfume that seemed to linger in the mist. She tugged at the hem of her shorts, already feeling the sting of regret starting to settle in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The street was alive with energy. Neon lights flickered above, buzzing and casting a sultry red glow that seemed to pulse with a rhythm all its own. The Clermont Lounge. The name gleamed in bold, seductive letters, promising a night of bad decisions and worse regrets. Agatha could already feel the weight of the night pressing down on her—an impending sense of dread that came from being so far outside her comfort zone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sidewalk was a chaotic mishmash of people—some dressed like they belonged on the pages of a high-fashion magazine, others looking like they'd stumbled straight out of the aftermath of a dive bar brawl. The energy was wild, erratic, buzzing like a live wire just waiting for someone to touch it and get burned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there they were, standing under the harsh neon lights like they owned the night itself: Mariah and Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach tightened, her pulse quickening. Her first instinct was to turn around and bolt back to the car, but she forced herself to take in the scene, to face the night head-on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah was impossible to miss. The woman was a walking spectacle, and tonight, she had outdone herself. She wore a completely transparent black mesh bodysuit, so high-cut and skin-tight it might as well have been painted on. Her lingerie, barely there, clung to her like a second skin, and her stilettos were so high they might as well have been weapons. They screamed power and confidence, the kind of shoes that only someone who had perfected the art of walking into a room and </span>

<span>owning</span>

<span> it could pull off. Her makeup was sharp enough to cut, smoky eyes framed by brows so arched they looked like they could pierce the sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it wasn’t just her look—it was the way she held herself, standing tall and confident, as though daring anyone in the crowd to even think about crossing her. She had the kind of presence that drew eyes, and Agatha couldn’t look away. Her expression—cool, measured, and exuding an air of challenge—seemed to say I dare you to say something about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God. Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The first thing Agatha noticed were the boots—black leather, knee-high, with a dangerously sharp heel that made her legs look impossibly long, sculpted in that effortless way that suggested she had never once tripped in her life. They hugged her calves like they had been made for her, accentuating every shift of her stride, every flex of muscle as she leaned her weight onto one hip, exuding the kind of lazy, predatory confidence that made it impossible to look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then there was the skirt. If it could even be called that. Black, short, and scandalous, clinging to the sharp angles of her hips, revealing just enough to make Agatha’s stomach twist. The slits on either side ran dangerously high, exposing smooth, golden skin all the way up her thighs, held together only by thin silver chains that caught the neon light every time she moved. It was obscene. It was unfair. It was the kind of thing that demanded attention, made you want to reach out and see if the chains would snap apart with just a tug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it was the jacket that sealed the deal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Black leather, cropped, oversized in that way that looked both impossibly casual and painstakingly deliberate, as if she had just shrugged it on without a second thought. The sleeves hung just past her wrists, swallowing her hands slightly, giving her a deceptively relaxed appearance. But the problem—the real fucking problem—was that it was barely even closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Single.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Button.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And underneath?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Just bare, golden skin, the smooth expanse of her stomach catching the city lights, the shadowed contours of her abs peeking through whenever she shifted, whenever she breathed. The way the jacket parted, teasing at the curve of her ribs, the delicate lines of her collarbones—it was maddening. The kind of maddening that made Agatha’s fingers twitch with the sudden, intrusive urge to test the warmth of that skin for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The neon glow from the club sign bathed her in deep reds and soft pinks, turning the exposed planes of her body into something almost unreal. Like she belonged there, under the flashing lights, in the humid night air, in the electric hum of the city. Like she had been made for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the fuck was that outfit? Who let her out of the house dressed like a goddamn sin? Why did it look like something ripped straight out of a high-fashion porno? </span>
</p><p>
<span>And why, </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span>, did she make it look so damn good?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had the audacity, the absolute infuriating confidence, to smirk when she caught sight of them, as if she could hear every catastrophic thought running through Agatha’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment Rio’s gaze landed on Agatha, it felt like a physical thing—an unspoken pull that made her skin prickle and her pulse stutter in a way she absolutely refused to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio’s dark eyes lifted and locked onto hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt the floor tilt beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio wasn’t just looking.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She was devouring.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze trailed over Agatha’s frame like a slow burn, deliberately, unashamedly, drinking in every inch of her. From the sheer fabric stretched over Agatha’s torso to the scandalous cut of her shorts, then back up, lingering—just a second too long—on the high ponytail, the exposed column of her throat, the subtle curve of her jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time their eyes met again, Agatha felt like she had been peeled open, laid bare under the weight of that gaze. Agatha was burning. And not just from the heat of the neon lights. It was the unmistakable weight of Rio’s gaze, lingering a second longer than necessary, like she was claiming Agatha in some private way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, as if she hadn’t just completely set Agatha on fire, Rio’s lips curved into a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lazy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Knowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat went dry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corner of Rio’s mouth tugged upward, and if Agatha didn’t know any better, she could’ve sworn she saw her breath hitch ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, there are our girls,” Mariah purred, her voice dripping with mischief as her eyes flicked over Natasha, before landing on Agatha with a look that could only be described as a predatory, appreciative scan. “And look at you, Harkness.” She let her gaze drag over Agatha’s outfit slowly, as if enjoying the sight of her discomfort. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, unwilling to acknowledge the flutter in her stomach as Rio’s gaze still settled on her, like a weight she couldn't quite shrug off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just go inside,” Agatha muttered, trying to move past the tension that had built up around her. But the tequila from earlier was barely doing its job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had a feeling she was going to need more. A lot more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, of course, Rio had to go and open her mouth again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” Rio’s voice was low and teasing, smooth like velvet, and edged with something she knew Agatha would find infuriating. “Didn’t expect you to clean up so nicely, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow twitched. “Didn’t expect you to show up looking like the cover model for ‘Slutty Mercenaries Monthly,’ but here we are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, unbothered and impossibly charming, like nothing could faze her. “You like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The outfit,” Rio said, her gaze still burning through Agatha. She tilted her head, studying her with that smug, irritatingly confident smirk still firmly in place. “You like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms even though she was suddenly very aware of how the sheer fabric of her shirt barely concealed the shift of her chest, and Rio noticed. Of course, she noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t flatter yourself,” Agatha muttered, but it sounded hollow even to her own ears. “I’ve seen less scandalous outfits in crime scenes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Rio grin. “So you’re saying I look criminal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More like indecent exposure waiting to happen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could continue with her endless teasing, Natasha—thankfully—threw an arm around Agatha’s shoulders and steered her toward the entrance with a casualness that Agatha could only envy. “Alright, children, let’s save the foreplay for inside, shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha choked on her own spit. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah just cackled, already striding ahead in her impossibly high heels, her laughter floating behind her like a teasing whisper. “Come on, ladies. We’ve got a night to ruin.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second they stepped inside, Agatha was hit with the heavy scent of whiskey, cheap perfume, and something faintly metallic. The air was thick, charged with something almost electric—anticipation, indulgence, the weight of too many secrets being exchanged in the dim glow of neon lights. The walls were exposed brick, the edges softened by the warm, flickering glow of scattered candles. A long, polished bar stretched along one side, backlit shelves displaying an expensive lineup of liquor, their glass bottles gleaming like forbidden fruit. The far end of the room was dominated by a stage, velvet curtains drawn just enough to tease at the possibility of what lay behind them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music was a low, pulsing rhythm, more of a slow seduction than a song, the bass thrumming like a heartbeat beneath the hum of conversation. The crowd was a mix of polished professionals and creatures of the night—women draped in silk and lace, men in tailored suits with their ties loosened, their gazes dark with intent. It was a place designed for indulgence, where the rules of the outside world ceased to exist the moment you walked through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only when they reached the reception area that Agatha noticed something odd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman in a tight black dress stood behind a velvet rope, a clipboard in one hand and an expression that was all business. Two security guards flanked a sleek, minimalist podium, their presence imposing enough to make it clear that trouble wouldn’t last long in a place like this. But it was the other woman, the one stationed beside them, was collecting phones, purses, jackets—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach tightened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Why was she collecting phones?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she watched people in line willingly hand over their belongings—phones, purses, jackets—like it was just another part of the routine. No hesitation. No argument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is this?” Agatha asked, her voice a sharp whisper, barely audible over the music. Her stomach coiled as she watched Natasha unclipping her purse strap, already moving to toss it into the bin like this was normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s standard here,” Mariah said smoothly, flashing a grin as she handed over her own phone. “No photos, no distractions, no evidence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “Evidence?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah turned toward her, eyes twinkling with amusement. “What? Didn’t you read the messages?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Obviously not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “It’s a strip club, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brain short-circuited.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked, completely thrown, her mind scrambling to catch up to the words that had just left Mariah’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha sighed dramatically, giving Agatha a deeply unimpressed look. “Oh, come on, Agatha. Did you really think I’d go out for a quiet little cocktail night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know!” Agatha hissed, waving her hands wildly. “I thought maybe we were going to a bar! A rooftop lounge! A goddamn speakeasy, not—” She gestured toward the room, as if that explained everything. “Not </span>
<em>
<span>this!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah just laughed, completely unfazed. She tossed her phone into the collection bin without a second thought. “Relax, babe. It’s not just </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> strip club.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Clermont,” Rio added, her voice warm, smooth, and entirely too entertained. “The most iconic one in the city.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dragged a hand down her face, exhaling sharply. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, fuck me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah smirked, eyes gleaming as she leaned in close enough that Agatha could smell the faint trace of vanilla and champagne on her skin. “Give it an hour, sweetheart,” she murmured. “You might just change your mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had two options. She could leave now, call an Uber, and spend the night drinking alone while Natasha charmed her way even deeper into her new friendships.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could watch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could </span>
<em>
<span>win</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m in,” Agatha said, shoving her phone into the bin before she could overthink it.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha let out a deep breath as she followed the others inside, resigned to her fate. It wasn’t that bad. She could handle this. Barely. But she could fake it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>How hard could it be right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the place actually didn’t look like a strip club at all—at least not the kind she’d seen in movies. There was no cheap plastic furniture, and, most importantly, no immediate sight of half naked men. Instead, the lighting was low and atmospheric, casting everything in a sultry, intimate glow. The décor was sleek, almost chic—dark leather booths lining the walls, a polished bar with tall stools, and large mirrors reflecting the dim shimmer of gold chandeliers overhead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music was thumping, a slow, sensual bass-heavy beat that she could feel in her bones, but there wasn’t the expected chaos of people hooting and throwing dollar bills. People were laughing, chatting, and dancing in the large open space near the bar. It was more refined than she’d expected—elegant, even.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This isn’t so bad.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe, just </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span>, this was a normal night out. Maybe she’d overreacted. There was nothing scandalous happening, no sign of half-naked performers—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts were interrupted by a low, almost purring voice from behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re in the private suites,” Rio murmured, almost as if reading her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course Vidal knew exactly what she was thinking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck her. </span>
<em>
<span>How did she do that? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Was she a witch? Some kind of supernatural seductress capable of slipping into Agatha’s mind at will? Or was Agatha just that obvious?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was sure it was the first one. Agatha wasn't an obvious person. Never had been, never will be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth. Private suites? Fantastic. She wasn’t exactly eager to get a lap dance from some high-priced performer. But it was fine. Totally fine. She could just avoid the suites. All she had to do was keep her distance, stay faraway from whatever hidden debauchery was happening behind those doors.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Easy.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah and Natasha had already weaved through the crowd, making a beeline for the bar. Agatha hesitated, scanning the sea of people, before following them. As uncomfortable as she was, she really didn’t want to be left alone in the middle of all this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bartender was a woman with a sleek bob and an amused smirk, clearly familiar with Mariah. The moment she spotted them, she was already reaching for the top-shelf tequila.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, ever the troublemaker, wasted no time. “</span>
<em>
<span>Shots,</span>
</em>
<span>” she announced, grinning wickedly as she placed her order, her voice echoing over the heavy bass of the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t argue. At this point, tequila was her best defense mechanism.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bartender poured four glasses with practiced ease, sliding them across the bar. Natasha grabbed hers immediately, raising it high. “To bad decisions and worse company,” she declared, eyes twinkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah snorted. “Oh, you wound me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To Agatha’s </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> excuse of a husband,” Natasha added, “well ex husband” voice dripping with venom as she threw her shot back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Oh my God, </span>
<em>
<span>Nat.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>will</span>
</em>
<span> keep toasting to that asshole until you admit you deserve better,” Natasha replied, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. “That man is a war crime in human form.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah let out a soft laugh, swirling the liquor in her glass before downing it in one smooth motion. “So we </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> here to celebrate, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, absolutely,” Natasha said. “I’ve been </span>
<em>
<span>waiting</span>
</em>
<span> for the day Agatha finally starts acting like a divorcée instead of a grieving widow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled, throwing back her shot before she could say something regrettable. The burn slid down her throat, warm and sharp, but she barely flinched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah nudged her with a teasing smirk. “That’s the spirit, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, running a hand through her ponytail. </span>
<em>
<span>Okay.</span>
</em>
<span> Maybe the tequila was kicking in, or maybe she’d just accepted her fate, but for the first time since stepping foot in this place, she felt herself relax. A little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could do this. It was just a club, after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to process the warmth in her throat from the tequila before Rio leaned in just slightly to grab another drink from the bar, close enough that Agatha could smell her perfume—something dark and musky, with just a hint of something sweeter underneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look tense, </span>
<em>
<span>Harkness</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said leaning back into her seat, her voice smooth, teasing, with just enough mock concern to make Agatha’s eye twitch. “What’s wrong? This isn’t your kind of scene?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, rolling her shoulders back in an attempt to appear </span>
<em>
<span>unbothered</span>
</em>
<span>. “You think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, drumming her fingers against the polished bar. “Shame. You </span>
<em>
<span>look</span>
</em>
<span> like you belong here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to glare at her, fully expecting to see amusement dancing in her dark eyes—but it wasn’t just amusement. It was something else. Something slow and deliberate, the way Rio’s gaze dragged over her like she had </span>
<em>
<span>all the time in the world</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha refused to acknowledge the way her pulse stuttered under that scrutiny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she raised an unimpressed brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could respond, Natasha turned toward her with an almost predatory grin as she set her empty shot glass down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, now that we’re here,” Natasha said, her voice teasing, her eyes gleaming with excitement. “Let’s go have some fun!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely gave Agatha a second to react before grabbing Mariah’s hand and pulling her toward the dance floor, leaving Agatha standing there—alone. With </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fantastic.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still seated on one of the high stools, stretched her legs out in that effortless, arrogant way she always did—like she owned the room, like she had every right to take up space and draw every wandering eye toward her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up at Agatha, slow and appraising, that smirk still playing at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess that leaves just the two of us,” Rio mused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath. “Great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, her fingers tightening around the edge of the bar. The music vibrated through the floor beneath her feet, heavy and pulsing, setting the atmosphere thick with something heady and charged. She could feel the heat rise in her cheeks as she glanced at Rio, the woman’s figure now all too close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just the two of them at the bar, the bass-heavy music vibrating through the floor beneath their feet. Rio was sitting next to her on one of the high stools, her legs stretched out in front of her in that effortless, arrogant manner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And of course, Agatha couldn’t help herself—her eyes drifted down to Rio’s long, toned legs, the dark leather boots hugging her calves, ending in a dangerous, almost provocative heel. She was impossibly sleek—every inch of her radiated confidence, and Agatha, despite herself, found her gaze lingering on the curve of her legs, the way they moved under the flashing lights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staring,” Rio said, her voice low, dripping with amusement as she noticed Agatha’s eyes linger. She leaned in slightly, her lips curling into a smirk, making her look even more trouble than usual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snapped her gaze back up to Rio’s face, already feeling the flush spreading across her cheeks. “I wasn’t staring,” she muttered, trying to recover some semblance of composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk only deepened. “Sure you weren’t. But then again,” she teased, her voice smooth as silk, “I didn’t think you had it in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, the irritation bubbling up again. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Vidal,” she said, trying to regain some control over the conversation, though her heart was hammering a little too loudly in her chest. “I’m just trying to survive the night without making a fool of myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, studying her with a lazily amused expression. Her hand grazed the edge of her drink, twirling it between her fingers. “Is that really your biggest concern? Or are you worried about making a fool of yourself around me?” she teased, her voice like velvet, each word dripping with playful menace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her pulse quicken, and she cursed herself for getting drawn into this. “I’m not worried about you. You give yourself too much credit Vidal” she shot back, though it was a bit too quick, too defensive. She could feel her nerves starting to fray.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, resting an elbow on the bar. “You always this fun at parties?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> planning on drinking in peace,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, considering. “Well, if that’s all you wanted, you should’ve just stayed home with a bottle of wine and the latest crime novel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “How do you know what I do at home?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, slow and knowing. “Oh, sweetheart. You’re </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> easy to read.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to argue, wanted to tell Rio to </span>
<em>
<span>fuck off</span>
</em>
<span>, but before she could get a word out, the bartender slid another drink in front of her—a deep amber liquid in a glass tumbler.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “I didn’t order this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow. “You did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I—” Agatha paused, eyeing Rio suspiciously. “</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> ordered it, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio merely took a sip of her own drink, all false innocence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, torn between suspicion and reluctant amusement. “And what </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something strong.” Rio swirled the liquid in her glass. “Something to help you </span>
<em>
<span>relax</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, picking up the glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, trying to keep her tone casual, but it came out a little sharper than intended. “Thanks, Vidal. I’m sure you’ll make sure of that, won’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry,” Rio said, her grin widening into something that made Agatha feel like she was walking into a trap. “I’ll keep an eye on you. Wouldn’t want you to get into any </span>
<em>
<span>trouble</span>
</em>
<span> without me.” She gave Agatha a once-over that seemed to assess every inch of her, making Agatha feel like she was being slowly dissected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heat in Agatha’s chest was starting to burn. What was wrong with her? Why was she letting Rio get under her skin like this? She needed to snap out of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you ever stop talking?” Agatha asked, trying to mask the unease creeping up on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, clearly enjoying herself far too much. “Only when I have to,” she said lightly. Her smirk deepened as she traced the rim of her empty shot glass with one finger. She tilted her head slightly, watching Agatha with lazy curiosity. “I think deep down, you </span>
<em>
<span>like</span>
</em>
<span> the attention.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t blame you,” Rio continued, clearly enjoying herself. “You pull off depraved and dangerous well. Wouldn’t be surprised if someone thought you were part of the club.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach did an infuriating little flip before she could stop it. She hated that Rio had this effect on her. That she could say literally anything and make it sound suggestive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take that as an insult,” she muttered, grabbing the nearest shot and throwing it back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.” Rio hummed, tapping her fingers idly against the counter. “It’s not”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of her stare was suffocating. Or maybe it was the tequila.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Either way, Agatha refused to let her win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re one to talk,” she shot back. “You showed up looking like a highly trained assassin with a side hustle in seduction.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, tilting her head. “So you have been looking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. She could only stare at her for a moment, unsure of how to respond. Rio’s presence felt too overwhelming, her proximity a constant reminder that Agatha was in way over her head. The world around her felt a little too small, the music a little too loud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could say anything, Rio raised her glass to her lips and took a slow sip, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “Let’s see what kind of trouble you can really get into tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hung in the air like a challenge, and Agatha was frozen, unsure if she wanted to step into that fire or run from it entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slowly stood up, her movement deliberate and almost predatory, as if every step was calculated to make Agatha’s heart race faster. She took a slow step toward Agatha, her eyes never leaving hers, the heat in her gaze palpable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Come on," Rio said, her voice a soft, teasing invitation. "Let’s go dance. You’ve got the look like you could use a little bit of fun tonight."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the familiar weight of her nervousness settle in her chest. She couldn’t deny that Rio was magnetic, and the idea of dancing so close to her, in this chaotic and seductive atmosphere, was enough to make her stomach twist in both anticipation and dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t going to fall for it. Not tonight. Not with everything swirling around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, thanks," Agatha said, her voice coming out firmer than she felt. She took a step back, trying to distance herself from Rio’s allure, but her words weren’t enough to shake the tension that had formed between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by the rejection, a half-smile curling at the corners of her lips. “Okay then,” she said lightly, her voice dripping with mock sweetness. “Guess I'll just have to have all the fun without you.” She turned on her heel, striding away with that confident swagger, heading toward the dance floor, leaving Agatha behind, her heart still racing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath, feeling a small sense of relief wash over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could settle into the moment, the bartender—a woman with dark, striking features, and a confident, sultry presence—leaned over the bar, casting a glance at Rio’s retreating figure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She's hot, you're a lucky lady" the bartender said, her tone a mix of admiration and curiosity as she wiped down the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly choked on the sip of her drink she was taking. “She’s not my date,” Agatha said, her voice flat, hoping to shut it down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bartender gave her an amused look, her lips curling into a sly smile. “Oh I'm sorry” She winked before walking off to attend to other customers, clearly not buying Agatha’s attempt at a denial.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed at the bar, her drink slowly becoming the anchor she clung to. The initial discomfort of being in this strange, high-energy environment was wearing off, replaced by the soothing buzz of the alcohol seeping into her system. Her fingers traced the rim of her glass absentmindedly, her thoughts fuzzy and disjointed. The music pulsed in the background, the rhythm syncing with the beat of her own heart, but she was too focused on the feeling of being slightly tipsy to care about anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, the noise and flashing lights seemed distant, and she was content with her own space, even as the others—Mariah, Rio, and Natasha—drifted in and out of her consciousness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, a familiar voice broke through the fog of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Alright loser, let's go," Natasha said, her voice carrying a playful edge. She was grinning wide as she approached Agatha, Mariah and Rio following her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The suit is ready," Natasha added, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "I reserved one for us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, trying to focus on what was going on. The room seemed to spin for a moment as she registered Natasha's words.Her stomach churned slightly at the thought of what that implied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, clearly oblivious to her inner turmoil, was already pulling her by the hand, not giving Agatha a moment to think about it. Mariah and Rio followed them, Nat´s energy infectious as she laughed and gestured for them to follow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for a moment, feeling the weight of the alcohol pulling her into a haze of indecision. She should probably be more cautious, but something about Natasha’s infectious enthusiasm made her want to tag along. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides, she wasn’t about to spend the rest of the night alone at the bar, looking like a wallflower. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a resigned sigh, Agatha let herself get dragged toward the suit. She could feel Rio’s eyes on her as she walked, but she didn’t dare look back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached the booth, Agatha slid into the plush seat, trying to make herself comfortable amidst the bright lights and throbbing music. She sank into the cushion, feeling the thrum of the bass in her bones, and glanced at the others. Mariah was already pulling her phone out to check something, Natasha was practically bouncing with excitement, and Rio was lounging casually in her seat, as if she owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath, trying to keep her focus, trying to make the night feel like it was something fun and exciting, instead of the rollercoaster ride of anxiety and confusion it had become.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her body betraying her anxiety as she squirmed on the plush cushion. She wasn’t used to this. Hell, she had never been in a strip club before, and she definitely hadn’t imagined ever doing it, let alone at her age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah leaned forward, her eyes wide with anticipation, while Natasha was practically glowing, her fingers drumming on the couch as she waited for the show to begin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that she didn’t belong here. She wasn’t cut out for this kind of atmosphere. She barely knew what to do with herself, feeling out of place in the skimpy outfit Natasha had dressed her in. And the last thing she wanted was to be one of the focus points of a stripper’s performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the suit, her gaze darting nervously toward the door, as if she could somehow will the night to go differently. She hoped—no, she prayed—that the stripper wouldn’t choose her. She couldn’t handle that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, the lights suddenly dimmed, plunging the room into darkness. The pulse of the music shifted, deep bass thumping through the floor like the beat of a heart. For a moment, it felt like everything was suspended in time, the anticipation almost too much to bear. She leaned forward instinctively, the shadows around her heightening the tension. What the hell had she gotten herself into?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, suddenly, a spotlight snapped on, its intense white light slicing through the darkened booth like a blade. Agatha blinked, her eyes adjusting to the glare, and she caught her breath at the sight of a figure stepping into the spotlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a guy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman who appeared before them was... not what Agatha expected at all. She was covered head to toe in sparkling silver and black sequins, her outfit hugging every curve as she stepped confidently into the spotlight. Her skin was glowing under the lights, and she moved like she owned the room, a slow, deliberate sway to her hips as she surveyed the  small room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind reeled for a moment. A female stripper? Her pulse quickened, a wave of confusion crashing over her. Wasn’t this supposed to be a male revue? She glanced at Natasha, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, the realization hit her like a ton of bricks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, her discomfort escalating. She hadn’t expected this. Not at all. She was not prepared for this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, she was sitting here, in this booth, watching a woman dressed in next to nothing getting ready to do who-knows-what to entertain them. It felt like a bad dream—one she couldn’t wake up from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The stripper began to dance, her movements fluid and confident, but all Agatha could think about was how much she just wanted to leave. The heat of embarrassment crept up her neck. She glanced at Mariah, who was practically salivating at the sight, and Natasha, who was looking at the performance with that same mischievous glint in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was not Agatha’s world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The stripper continued to sway, her body moving in time with the music. The beat of the sound pulsed in the air, heavy and insistent, and the glittering woman’s body seemed to shimmer with every movement, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. Her eyes locked with Agatha’s for a brief moment, and Agatha quickly looked away, her fingers digging into the plush booth as if it could somehow anchor her to something solid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mariah was practically on the edge of her seat, her eyes wide, a grin plastered on her face as she watched, clearly enjoying the show. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could barely focus on the performance. Every part of her was screaming to leave, to do anything to escape the tension coiling in her stomach. But then, the stripper did something that made Agatha freeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman stepped off the little center stage, her eyes never leaving Agatha, and began to walk toward her. Agatha's breath caught in her throat, and she felt a sudden, intense urge to shrink into herself. The woman’s steps were calculated, confident, and the rhythmic sway of her hips drew every eye in the room toward her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached, Agatha’s palms began to sweat. She didn’t want this. She knew, though, that she couldn’t avoid it. The woman moved closer, and Agatha instinctively straightened up, shifting uncomfortably on her seat. She didn’t even know what to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the stripper reached them, she stopped just a few feet away, the air around her thick with the scent of perfume and sweat. The woman looked at her with a knowing smile, as if she could sense Agatha’s unease. But before Agatha could form a single word, Rio, ever the instigator, leaned in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, darling,” Rio said with that smirk Agatha had come to dread. “She’s not going to bite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The stripper gave a slight chuckle and turned back to Agatha, her hands moving to adjust her outfit, each touch seeming to heighten the tension in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, without a word, the stripper began to dance. Her movements were slow, sensual, and deliberate as she lowered herself in front of Agatha, one hand resting on her knee, the other gliding up her leg. The air seemed to thicken around them as the woman’s body shifted, the soft, seductive music filling the space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest, and she swallowed hard, feeling the heat of the woman’s body so close to hers. But it wasn’t the woman herself that had Agatha’s blood running cold. No, it was the way Rio’s gaze moved from the stripper to Agatha, that damned smirk still playing on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sensing Agatha's doubt the girl moved to Rio who was sitting next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out, her hands moving to the stripper’s hips, guiding her as if they were already familiar with each other. The two of them moved as one, Rio’s hands gliding expertly over the woman’s body, guiding her with precision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel a tightness in her chest. The way Rio’s hands slid over the woman’s skin, the way their bodies meshed together on that small suit, made her insides twist in a way she didn’t understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed her thoughts down, forcing herself to focus on the show instead. She didn’t want to look, didn’t want to see how much Rio was enjoying herself. But, despite every rational thought in her mind, she couldn’t tear her gaze away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and the stripper moved together, the rhythm between them effortless and fluid. Agatha’s pulse raced as she watched, her breath catching at the intimacy of the moment. It was too much, too overwhelming, and before she could stop herself, she looked at Rio. Just for a second. Her heart thudded as she caught Rio’s eyes, that smirk still in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly turned away, her face flushed with something she refused to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The show continued for what felt like an eternity, every movement from the stripper and Rio adding to the weight in Agatha's chest. She tried to keep her focus elsewhere—on the drinks in front of her, on the glistening lights of the club, on the chaos swirling around her—but all she could see were Rio’s hands on the stripper, guiding her through the dance with a familiarity that made Agatha feel like she was suffocating. Her pulse was erratic, her mind a jumbled mess, and every second of the performance made her more aware of how utterly out of place she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, the music started to fade, the stripper’s performance coming to a close. The woman got off of Nats lap. When did that happen? Agatha hadn't realized that. The woman gave one last slow, seductive spin, winking at her as she made her way off the small room. The lights flickered back to their usual dim ambiance, and her friends erupted into applause. Agatha’s chest was still tight, her breath shallow, and she knew she couldn’t stay there a moment longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to use the bathroom,” she muttered to no one in particular, bolting from her seat before anyone could stop her. Her legs felt unsteady as she slipped out of the booth, weaving through the crowded club. She pushed past bodies that barely acknowledged her presence, the thrum of music pressing against her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she stepped into the relative quiet of the bathroom, she stopped. Exhaling sharply, she braced herself against the sink, trying to steady the storm churning inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her reflection in the mirror caught her eye as she walked past the bathroom door, and for a split second, she didn’t even recognize the person staring back at her. The tight leather, the makeup—it was all too much. She felt like an imposter, someone who had walked into a world that wasn’t hers, only to find herself tangled in emotions she couldn’t untangle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head and turned away, her thoughts racing. “Get it together,” she muttered to herself. “It’s just a night out. Nothing more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it didn’t feel like just another night out. Not anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking one more breath, she stepped out of the hallway and back into the main room. The club’s noise seemed louder now, more overwhelming. She needed to find Nat. She needed to get out of here.</span>
<em>
<span> And fast.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As she looked around, she spotted Rio again, this time on the dance floor, talking to a guy. Her stomach dropped.She could feel that gnawing sensation from before creeping back,  irritation at herself for getting caught up in this whole damn mess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking, Agatha started walking toward her, her heels clicking against the floor in a steady rhythm that didn’t match the storm inside her head. She reached the edge of the dance floor and stopped just short of Rio, who hadn’t noticed her yet—her focus was on the man standing in front of her, leaning in slightly, drink in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vidal,” Agatha called out, her voice sharper than intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned at the sound, a slow smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Harkness,” she drawled, her amusement unmistakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze flicked to the man still standing beside Rio, clearly waiting for her attention. “I’m sorry to interrupt… whatever </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> is,” she added, voice laced with disdain. Then, without hesitation, she turned to him. “You can go now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The man scoffed, his expression shifting from mild surprise to irritation. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a quiet chuckle, swirling the drink in her hand. “Yeah, sweetheart,” she murmured, her eyes glinting with mischief. “She </span>
<em>
<span>excused</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The man muttered something under his breath, shaking his head before stalking off. Agatha ignored him, already focused on Rio, who was now watching her with a look that made her feel entirely too seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you need something?” Rio asked, her voice smooth and effortless, as if she already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart thudded against her ribs, but she shoved it down. “Where are Natasha and Mariah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laughter cut through the music, low and rich, curling around Agatha in a way that made her skin prickle. “Probably fucking somewhere,” she said with a shrug, taking a sip from her drink before flicking her gaze back to where the man had been standing a moment ago, as if vaguely disappointed that he’d left so easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, her brain tripping over itself. “Wait, what?” she blurted. “You mean, Mariah is—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, looking at Agatha with that same knowing smirk. “Is she gay? You’re seriously asking me that?” she replied, her voice dripping with amusement. She gave a slow, exaggerated once-over of Agatha’s face, as though processing the question fully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. “…I mean, I just didn’t—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched her brow, looking at her like she’d just asked if water was wet as she exhaled sharply, shaking her head in exaggerated disbelief. “Oh, wait. You’re actually serious.” She gave Agatha a slow, deliberate once-over, as if she needed to assess just </span>
<em>
<span>how</span>
</em>
<span> clueless she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heat prickled at Agatha’s skin. “I—uh, yeah,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the railing, clearly savoring Agatha’s discomfort. “Incredible,” she huffed, before taking another sip of her drink. “But yeah, Mariah is into women. Painfully obvious if you’ve been paying attention.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay, I </span>
<em>
<span>get</span>
</em>
<span> it.” Agatha was absolutely mortified but trying to recover. “I still need to find Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly, eyes glimmering with something unreadable. “Why don’t you just enjoy the night, Agatha?” She smirked. “You’re doing fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Frustration sparked in Agatha’s chest. She wasn’t about to let Rio be smug and vague, especially when she was already so damn confused about everything else. “I’m not here to enjoy anything,” she snapped. “I just want to find her so we can go home. Please, help me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio simply watched her, unreadable as ever. Agatha braced herself for another smirk, another dismissive quip—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Rio sighed, shifting closer, her voice dipping just enough to make Agatha’s pulse stutter. “Fine, fine,” she relented, though amusement still curled at the edges of her words. “You’ve got that look in your eyes like you’re about to throw a tantrum, and trust me, no one needs to see that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, but relief outweighed her irritation. “Thank you,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah. Let’s get you back to the troublemakers, shall we?” Rio winked before turning on her heel, slipping effortlessly through the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha trailed behind, trying to ignore the thrumming beat of the music that made her head feel like it was spinning, and trying to push away the increasingly complicated thoughts swirling in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they weaved their way through the people on the dance floor, Agatha couldn’t help but wonder what was really going on with her. Why did Vidal affect her like this? Why did she feel like she was always on edge around her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have time to think about it now, though. All that mattered was getting Nat and getting the hell out of this crazy club before she did something she'd regret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bass vibrated through the floor as they climbed the stairs to the second level. Up here, the flashing lights made everything feel even more surreal, casting the crowd in alternating hues of electric blue and crimson that only added to the disorienting atmosphere. Laughter and conversation blurred into the music, creating a dizzying, intoxicating hum. Rio, as always, moved like she belonged—confident, unbothered. Agatha, on the other hand, felt like an intruder, still reeling from the performance earlier, from everything that had unraveled since.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just needed to focus. Find Natasha. Get out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then it happened—too fast for her to react.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shift in the crowd. A misstep. A stray heel beneath her foot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The world around her seemed to blur for a moment, and as she moved, her foot caught on something, a stray heel or a slight misstep. The next thing she knew,  balance wavered, her stomach lurching as she stumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could hit the floor, a firm hand caught her at the small of her back—steady, deliberate. </span>
<em>
<span>Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The touch sent a shock through Agatha, sharp and electric, </span>
<em>
<span>paralyzing</span>
</em>
<span>. Her body tensed, her pulse hammering in her throat. She could feel the heat of Rio’s palm through the basically non existent fabric of her skirt, grounding her, </span>
<em>
<span>burning her</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The contact was electric, a sharp jolt that sent heat through Agatha’s spine, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe. The weight of Rio’s touch sent an involuntary shiver through her, and Agatha froze</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instinct took over before logic could intervene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's hand shot out, wrapping around Rio’s wrist, yanking it away as if she’d been scorched. The movement was instinctual, almost too fast, driven by an impulse she couldn’t quite control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t stop there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In one sharp motion, she pushed forward, slamming Rio against the nearest wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A muted </span>
<em>
<span>thud</span>
</em>
<span>. A sharp inhale.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The impact was shocking, and before Agatha could steady herself, she found herself pressing Rio into the wall, her chest flushing against the other woman's. A sharp breath caught in her throat, her pulse racing. Agatha could feel the heat radiating off Rio's body, the way their bodies seemed to melt together in that split second. The music throbbed around them, but all Agatha could hear was the quick, uneven rhythm of their breaths mingling in the heavy air.  The hot air of the club felt like it was pressing in on her, and yet, in that instant, she could hear the rush of her own pulse in her ears, louder than everything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely registered the fact that she had just pinned Rio—her own breath coming faster, her chest heaving from the sheer force of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment stretched, taut and suffocating, as Agatha’s mind tried to catch up with her body’s betrayal. She could feel the softness of Rio’s skin under her hands, the curve of her hips against Agatha’s own, and the unmistakable warmth that seemed to intensify with every passing second. It was too much, too overwhelming, and Agatha wanted to push away, to break free from this bizarre, charged moment, but something kept her rooted in place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind screamed at her to move. To step back. To </span>
<em>
<span>breathe</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse thrummed painfully in her throat, her breath hitching as she tried to clear her thoughts, but Rio wasn’t helping. Her body was flush against the wall, but her expression didn’t falter. If anything, she looked amused. Surprised, yes, but entertained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, she tilted her head back, dark eyes gleaming as they locked onto Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world around them dissolved—just pounding bass, dim lights, and the unbearable heat between them. Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>too close</span>
</em>
<span>, close enough to feel the warmth of her breath fanning against her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was enough to bring her back to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She hadn’t meant to do that—</span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> of that. She hadn’t meant to react like this, hadn’t meant to </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> the way she was feeling. Her stomach twisted into a knot as she let go of Rio’s wrist and took a step back, hands suddenly clammy, as if the touch had </span>
<em>
<span>burned</span>
</em>
<span> her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Careful there, Harkness," Rio murmured, her voice low, almost teasing. "You might break something."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I—I didn’t mean to—" Agatha started, but her voice faltered. She realized how ridiculous she must look. </span>
<em>
<span>She</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t lose control like this—not over something so stupid. But the way Rio was looking at her, the way she was still leaning against the wall, made Agatha feel like she was about to lose her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move, didn’t break eye contact. "Didn’t mean to what?" she asked, her voice thick with amusement. "Hurt me? Or are you just upset you didn’t get the reaction you wanted?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening. She wasn’t sure how to respond. She wasn’t sure she even </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> to respond. The tension between them was suffocating, pressing in like the walls of the club itself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The teasing, the way Rio seemed to know exactly how to provoke her—it was </span>
<em>
<span>too much</span>
</em>
<span>, and Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated how she felt. She hated how Rio </span>
<em>
<span>made</span>
</em>
<span> her feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she couldn’t look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, they stood frozen in the dim, pulsing light, the bass vibrating through the floor, matching the erratic thud of Agatha’s heart. She opened her mouth to say something—</span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span>—but before she could, Rio pushed off the wall, stepping forward with a devilish smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You really should work on your anger management, Harkness," Rio teased, her voice dripping with that same, maddening confidence. She moved toward Agatha, slow and deliberate, eyes locked onto hers in a silent challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands clenched together at her sides, as if grounding herself could steady the storm inside her. She took a deep breath, willing herself to step back, to </span>
<em>
<span>move</span>
</em>
<span>—but the discomfort surged through her like a wave, and it wasn’t enough to shake her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop it," Agatha muttered, her voice a breathless rasp. She </span>
<em>
<span>should</span>
</em>
<span> walk away. She </span>
<em>
<span>should</span>
</em>
<span> turn around and leave. But her body refused to listen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly, the smirk on her lips only deepening. "Stop what?" she asked, feigning innocence. Her gaze flickered lower, lingering—just for a fraction of a second—on Agatha’s lips before meeting her eyes again, as if daring her to admit what was really happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled shakily and pulled back just enough to break the intensity. "</span>

<span>Stop</span>
</em>
<span>," she repeated, though this time, it sounded more like a command than a plea. She stepped back quickly, but her breath was still uneven, her chest rising and falling too fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk never faltered, but something shifted in her eyes—something that made Agatha’s pulse </span>
<em>
<span>stutter</span>
</em>
<span> even as she tried to ignore it. When Rio spoke again, her voice was slow, deliberately teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What exactly do you want to stop?" she asked, her tone rich with mock curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her words came out sharper than she intended, laced with frustration and something dangerously close to confusion. "The annoying, the vexing—I don’t know what you’re doing, but it’s driving me insane." Her hands curled into fists at her sides, but she was still too close, still too aware of Rio’s presence. "I just... I don’t get it. Why do you hate me so much?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, clearly taken aback by the question. Her eyebrows furrowed slightly, and for a second, the smirk faltered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You think I hate you?" she asked, her voice tinged with disbelief. “Are you seriously asking me that right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, but Rio was already stepping closer, her voice dropping again, taking on a heavier, more deliberate tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t hate you, Agatha. I’m not that simple," Rio said, her words almost a confession. "But if you’re asking why I flirt with you, why I enjoy watching you squirm..." She shrugged, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "It’s because I can’t help it." A pause, a wicked little smile. "You’re fun to toy with. You’re a challenge, something to crack open." She tilted her head slightly, her voice turning silkier. "And believe me, I love the hunt."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind stalled for a split second, as if her brain had short-circuited, struggling to process what Rio had just said. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Flirting?</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>The word rang in her ears, foreign, impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her legs felt unsteady beneath her, and she hated it—hated the way her body betrayed her, how the room suddenly felt too warm, how her pulse stuttered against her will.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her reaction unfold, a slow realization dawning across Agatha’s face, and then—she laughed. A short, incredulous chuckle, like she couldn't believe what she was seeing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god,” Rio exhaled, shaking her head in disbelief. “You didn’t know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, her throat dry. “I—” She had no idea what to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression shifted, half amused, half annoyed. She crossed her arms, one brow arching in exasperation. “Yes, Agatha, I’ve been flirting with you. Wasn’t it obvious?” Her voice dripped with something between mockery and frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach lurched. The weight of the conversation, the implication behind it, crashed into her like a wave, and she recoiled. Her hands clenched into fists, her spine stiffening as she scrambled for footing in the moment spinning wildly out of her control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she snapped, a heat rising in her chest—too sharp, too defensive. “I—I don’t </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> that.” Her voice was firm, but the slight tremble in it betrayed her. She took a step back, putting space between them as if that would somehow make this whole thing go away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her smirk still present but something sharper flickering beneath it. “No?” she echoed, her tone deliberately casual, but there was something else there too—something unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha repeated, her voice stronger now, her anger cutting through the lingering haze of confusion. “I’m straight” The words tumbled out, fast and certain, like a shield thrown up just in time. “So whatever this is—whatever you're doing—it needs to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, Rio’s smirk faltered, but it wasn’t quite disappointing. It was something closer to </span>
<em>
<span>understanding</span>
</em>
<span>, like she had just solved a puzzle she had been working on for a while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that, more than anything, made Agatha’s pulse hammer even harder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind whirled, her thoughts scattering as Rio’s words hit her like a ton of bricks. The overwhelming mix of emotions—confusion, frustration—left her dizzy. She couldn’t make sense of any of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was she angry? Or was she... intrigued? The thought of Rio, this unpredictable, enigmatic woman, </span>
<em>
<span>hunting</span>
</em>
<span> her like a game sent a strange kind of thrill through Agatha’s veins that she had no idea how to deal with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied her for a long moment, her gaze sharp, her lips curling into something almost sadistic. “Sure, Agatha,” she said, her voice playful but laced with something more serious beneath it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her heart pounding in her ears. She didn’t know what was worse—the way Rio seemed to know exactly how to get under her skin, or the fact that a part of her... liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk lingered, but there was something different now—something sharper in her eyes. She took a deliberate step closer to Agatha, not quite touching her but still close enough that Agatha could feel the heat radiating from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t get what you’re doing” Agatha murmured, her voice wavering slightly. She ran a hand through her hair in frustration, eyes dropping to the floor before meeting Rio’s gaze again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile softened, but it still had that edge to it. “I wasn't trying to confuse you on purpose”. She tilted her head slightly, studying Agatha as if debating something in her mind. Then, after a long pause, she exhaled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said, her voice lighter now, almost casual. “I’ll stop.” She held up her hands in mock surrender, though the glint in her eyes suggested she wasn’t entirely done playing. “Wouldn’t want to make you </span>
<em>
<span>uncomfortable</span>
</em>
<span>, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t sure why, but the way Rio said it—so smooth, so nonchalant—made something in her chest twist. She should’ve felt relieved. She wanted to feel relieved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, her skin prickled with unease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step back, creating distance between them, but not before leaning in just enough for her breath to ghost against Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You're not fooling anyone, Harkness," Rio murmured under her breath, loud enough for Agatha to hear, but not so loud that anyone else could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the weight of those words settle on her chest. She opened her mouth, but no words came out. She had never felt so exposed, so seen. This wasn’t just about her being confused over what Rio was doing—this was about her confusion over herself, about what she was feeling. She had always been straight. That was just who she was. But Rio... Rio made her feel things—things that felt dangerous, things she couldn’t deny, even though part of her wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in that moment she realized something </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe, just maybe, she was fooling herself.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know what was happening, didn’t know how it was happening , but the attraction was undeniable. Maybe it was the alcohol messing with her brain, maybe it wasn't, but in this moment she knew she couldn’t run from this anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse slammed against her ribs as she jerked her head up to meet Rio’s gaze, but Rio was already turning away to disappear into the crowd as if nothing had happened at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could stop herself, before the rational part of her brain could kick in, Agatha grabbed Rio by the shoulders, her fingers digging into the hard leather of Rio’s jacket. She pressed her body against Vidal´s, and for the briefest moment, Rio didn’t move, didn’t resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she could feel Rio’s breath catch, and without thinking, Agatha pulled her in, closing the gap between them. Their lips collided in a kiss and Agatha felt  the plushness of Rio's full mouth against her own lips for the first time. It felt like everything and nothing all at once. It was urgent, reckless—nothing like anything Agatha had ever experienced before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if Rio sensed her doubts , she grabbed her chin, holding her still, tilting her head to align their lips perfectly. Agatha’s breath hitched, as if she’d been holding it in this whole time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded as she felt Rio’s hands on her waist, pulling her closer, their bodies aligning as if they were made for this moment. Agatha’s mind spun, but she didn’t care anymore. All that mattered was the feeling of Rio’s mouth on hers, the heat, the electricity, the undeniable pull that seemed to draw them together against all reason.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t think. She didn’t need to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss deepened, and Agatha’s body responded before her mind could even register what was happening. </span>
<span>Rio’s tongue swiped over her top bottom lip, asking for permission to enter. She didn't resist. The sound that escaped her mouth was obscene, foreign to her own ears. She's sure she’s never made that sound before, not even in the deepest of pleasure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let Rio’s tongue explore like she’d been starved for it, as if every barrier had just crumbled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe it had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They finally broke apart, the soft, wet sound of their lips parting lingering between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt breathless and dizzy, unable to bring herself to look at Rio. Her heart was still racing, her mind still reeling, still trying to make sense of how she’d ended up here—kissing Rio Vidal, the woman who had driven her to the brink of madness and back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry. I shouldn’t have done that,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible, though she wasn’t sure if she was talking to Rio, to herself, or to the whole damn universe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, her expression unreadable, though her eyes gleamed with that same infuriating mischief, her eyes darkening. “I’m glad you did,” she said, her voice thick with satisfaction and something else Agatha couldn’t quite place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a breath as if about to say something, her lips parting, and Agatha knew—</span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span>—whatever came next would be insufferable. A teasing remark, a smug quip, something that would make her want to strangle Rio just as much as she wanted to—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could get a word out, Agatha grabbed her by the neck, yanking her close with a desperate, almost feral urgency.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For once, please just shut the fuck up,” she growled, her voice rough with frustration, pulling her close before crushing their lips together again.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>This time Agatha's kiss was demanding, a release of everything she had been holding back. Her desire burned like wildfire, consuming and unstoppable as she took control, letting go of all inhibitions. The world around them faded into a blur of heat and sensation as she pressed Rio against the nearest wall, their bodies colliding with a fierce, primal hunger. Agatha's fingers gripped Rio's neck with possessive fervor, pulling her closer, feeling the curve of her jaw and the softness of her skin beneath her fingertips. Every inch of Agatha radiated heat, her body pinning the younger woman firmly in place.</p><p>The moment was a tangled mess of heat and desire, their two bodies colliding with a fierce and primal hunger, each one trying to devour the other. Agatha's kiss was fierce, leaving no room for doubt or hesitation. Rio, with her tousled hair and flushed skin, surrendered completely, her own hunger matching Agatha's in intensity.  She could feel the rapid rise and fall of Rio's chest against her own, the younger woman's breath hitching as Agatha deepened the kiss, her lips claiming Rio's with a fierce, almost desperate hunger.</p><p>Her fingers slid up to cradle Rio's jaw, tilting her head to deepen the kiss further. The taste of Rio was intoxicating, a mix of sweetness and something darker, something primal that made Agatha's head spin. She pressed Rio harder against the wall, the cool surface a stark contrast to the heat radiating between them.</p><p>Rio's hands were everywhere, frantically roaming over Agatha's body, leaving trails of warmth and electricity wherever they touched. When her fingers tangled in Agatha's ponytail, she tugged gently, undoing the tie and letting her hair fall loose around her shoulders. The sensation sent a shiver down Agatha's spine, and she groaned softly against Rio's lips. Rio's hand slid into Agatha's hair, her fingers threading through the strands as she traced the line of Agatha's jaw with her thumb. The touch was tender, almost reverent, and it made Agatha's heart ache. Her other hand skimmed down her sides. Rio tugged at Agatha's shirt, desperate for more contact, more of her. </p><p>Agatha wasn't idle either. With precision, she undid the button on Rio's jacket, her fingers brushing against the flushed skin beneath. Rio's breath hitched again, and she broke the kiss to trail hot, open mouthed kisses along Agatha's neck. The sensation was overwhelming, sending jolts of electricity coursing through Agatha's body. She tilted her head back, giving Rio better access, her hands gripping Rio's hips to steady herself. It was overwhelming, too much and yet not enough. </p><p>The intensity of it all threatened to consume her, it  was almost too much. Agatha felt as though she were standing on the edge of a precipice, teetering dangerously close to the point of no return. She could feel the heat of Rio's skin beneath her fingertips, the way Rio's body arched into hers, seeking more. The sound of their ragged breathing filled the air, mingling with the soft, desperate noises that escaped Rio's lips as Agatha's hands explored further.</p><p>And then, like a cold wave crashing over her, the realization hit.</p><p>With a gasp, Agatha wrenched herself away, putting distance between them. Her chest heaved as she stared at Rio, her eyes wide with disbelief. The weight of what had just happened settled heavily on her shoulders.</p><p>Rio stood there, pinned against the wall, utterly wrecked. Her jacket hung open, revealing glimpses of her toned stomach and black nipple covers peeking out from beneath. Her usually perfect styled hair was now a tangled mess, wild strands framing her face. Her lips were swollen and red, a testament to the ferocity of Agatha's kisses, and her chest rose and fell rapidly as she tried to catch her breath. Her eyes, dark with desire, locked onto Agatha's with an intensity that made her stomach twist as she struggled to catch her breath.</p><p>Agatha's mind raced, her heart pounding in her chest. She looked at Rio, torn between the heat of the moment and the cold clarity of reality. What had they done? </p><p>What had <em> she </em> done?</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The air between them was thick with tension, the silence heavy with unspoken words. Agatha's mind raced, her heart pounding in her chest as she struggled to make sense of what had just happened. She had crossed a line, one she hadn't even realized was there until it was too late. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut, and she took another step back, putting even more distance between them.</p><p>Her fingers tingled, still burning from where they'd gripped Rio’s skin, from where they'd pulled her in.</p><p>She took another step back, and then another, as if physical distance could undo the kiss, could erase the heat still lingering on her lips. But nothing could, and that terrified her more than anything.</p><p>"I—I can’t," she muttered, more to herself than to Rio, shaking her head as if trying to shake off the moment entirely. "I shouldn’t have—fuck."</p><p>Rio, for once, didn’t say anything. She just watched her, lips still slightly parted, eyes sharp and unreadable. That same smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth, but this time, it wasn’t quite as smug, it was knowing. <em> Like she had expected this. Like she had been waiting for it. </em></p><p>And that only made it worse.</p><p>Agatha turned sharply on her heel, barely trusting her legs to carry her. Her heart pounded in her chest, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She needed to leave. She needed air, space. Anything that wasn’t Rio Vidal standing there, looking at her like <em> that </em>. Like she had seen straight through her, past every wall, every defense, straight to the core of her</p><p>"Agatha" Rio’s voice cut through the noise, trembling and uncertain.</p><p>"No," Agatha snapped, her voice harsher than she intended. She didn’t look back. She couldn’t. If she did, she wasn’t sure she’d be able to keep walking.</p><p>And then she was gone, pushing through the crowd, ignoring the curious glances, the pulse of the music, the burn in her chest. If Rio followed she didn't know, she was only looking forwards, trying to get to the exit of the club. </p><p>She needed to leave. She needed to get her phone, call a ride, go home, go anywhere but here. Her hands were shaking by the time she reached the coat check. The attendant gave her an odd look as she fumbled for the ticket in her jacket pocket, barely managing to hand it over. Seconds stretched into eternity before her phone and bag were back in her hands. She clutched them tightly, as if they were the only solid things keeping her from falling apart.</p><p>She pressed the power button on her phone, her heart hammering as the screen lit up. Her fingers trembled as she typed out a message to Nat:</p><p>
<em> I’m going home. There's a key under the mat on the front door. </em>
</p><p>She didn’t stop moving. Not when she reached the door. Not when she stepped out into the cool night air. Not even when she realized she had no idea where she was going, only that she needed to get away.</p><p>Agatha barely registered the cool night air as she stumbled away from the bar, her head spinning for reasons that had nothing to do with alcohol.</p><p>She pulled up the Uber app with unsteady fingers, forcing herself to focus. The words on the screen blurred slightly as she typed in her address. Five minutes. That was all she had to wait.</p><p>But five minutes was an eternity when her mind wouldn’t shut the hell up.</p><p>Her lips still tingled. She wiped at them furiously, as if that would erase the memory, erase the feeling. She had kissed a girl. Not just any girl. <em> She had kissed Rio. </em> And it wasn’t just some fleeting, accidental brush. It was desperate and messy and so, so real. Her stomach twisted violently.</p><p>It had to be the alcohol.</p><p>That was the only explanation. The shots, the drinks, something had messed with her head, blurred the lines, made her do something she never would have done otherwise.</p><p>Because <em> she wasn’t like that. </em></p><p>She wasn’t.</p><p>Her breathing turned shallow, panic clawing up her throat. She had dated men. She had been with men. She liked men, only men. So what the hell was this?</p><p>Her mind kept looping back to the way Rio had looked at her afterward…</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, pressing the heels of her palms against them. <em> No. No, this wasn’t real. It didn’t mean anything. It was just a stupid mistake. A lapse in judgment. A moment of— </em></p><p>Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of it.</p><p>
<em> Your driver is here. </em>
</p><p>Without another thought, Agatha shoved her phone in her pocket, walked to the car, and slid into the back seat.</p><p>She didn’t look back.</p><p>The ride home was a blur. Agatha stared out the window, her reflection staring back at her in the darkened glass. She looked pale, her lips still slightly swollen, her hair disheveled. She couldn’t bring herself to fix it. She couldn’t bring herself to do anything but sit there, her hands clenched tightly in her lap, her mind racing.</p><p>--------</p><p>When the car finally pulled up to her house, Agatha practically threw herself out of the back seat, muttering a quick “thanks” to the driver before slamming the door shut. She didn’t wait for a response. She didn’t care. All she cared about was getting inside, locking the door, and shutting out the world.</p><p>Her hands shook as she fumbled with her keys, dropping them twice before finally managing to unlock the door. She stepped inside, slamming it shut behind her and leaning against it for a moment, her chest heaving. The silence of the house was deafening, a stark contrast to the chaos in her mind.</p><p>She tossed her bag onto the floor and pulled out her phone, her fingers trembling as she powered it off without looking at the notifications. She didn’t want to see any messages. She didn’t want to hear from anyone. Especially not Rio. The thought of that name made her stomach churn, and she shoved the phone into her couch as if that would make it disappear.</p><p>Agatha moved through the house on autopilot, her body numb but her mind screaming. She needed to wash it all away, every touch, every kiss, every lingering trace of Rio. She needed to scrub her skin raw if that’s what it took to feel clean again.</p><p>She stumbled into the bathroom, turning on the shower with a sharp twist of the knob. The water roared to life, steam quickly filling the small space. Agatha didn’t wait for it to heat up. She stripped off her clothes, tossing them into a heap on the floor, and stepped under the spray.</p><p>The water was scalding, almost painfully hot, but she didn’t care. She welcomed the burn, the way it seared her skin, as if it could erase the memory of Rio’s hands on her, Rio’s lips against hers. She grabbed the soap and scrubbed at her arms, her shoulders, her neck…anywhere Rio had touched her, kissed her. </p><p>Her movements were frantic, desperate, her skin turning red under the harsh pressure.  But no matter how hard she scrubbed, she couldn’t get rid of the feeling. It was like Rio was still there, her touch imprinted on Agatha’s skin, her presence lingering in the air. Agatha’s breath hitched, and she pressed her forehead against the cool tile, her body trembling under the relentless spray of the water.</p><p>“Why did I do that?” she whispered, her voice breaking. </p><p>The question echoed in her mind, taunting her. </p><p>Agatha hated herself for it. Hated the way her body had responded, the way her heart had raced, the way she had felt so alive in Rio’s arms. It was wrong. It had to be wrong. She wasn’t supposed to feel that way. She wasn’t supposed to want that.</p><p>Agatha’s knees gave out, and she sank to the floor of the shower, the water pounding down on her back. She wrapped her arms around herself, her nails digging into her skin as she tried to hold herself together. But it was no use. The tears came then, hot and relentless, mixing with the water streaming down her face.</p><p>She hated the way she couldn’t stop thinking about Rio, the way her body still ached for her touch. Hated the way she couldn’t even look at herself in the mirror without feeling disgusted.</p><p>“I’m not like that,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of the water. “I’m not.”</p><p>But the words felt hollow, empty. Because deep down, she knew the truth. She had kissed Rio. She had wanted to. And no amount of scrubbing, no amount of self-loathing, could change that.</p><p>Agatha stayed there for what felt like hours, the water running cold long before she finally turned it off. She stepped out of the shower, her body numb, her mind still reeling. She wrapped herself in a towel and avoided the mirror, unable to face her own reflection.</p><p>When she finally got back into her room her eyes flicked to the clock on the wall. 4:07 AM. The numbers glowed faintly in the dim light of the moon coming in from her window, a cruel reminder of how little time she had left to pull herself together. Daniel was supposed to drop Nicky off at 2 PM for his birthday party, and she still had a mountain of things to do. The decorations, the cake, the snacks, none of it was ready. She had promised Nicky it would be the best birthday ever, and now she was on the verge of ruining it. </p><p>She dragged a hand over her face, her skin still raw from the shower. Her body felt heavy, her mind sluggish, but sleep was the last thing she wanted. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Rio. Felt Rio. The memory of their kiss was like a brand, seared into her mind, and she couldn’t escape it.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself off the couch and walked down the hallway, her footsteps echoing in the quiet apartment. She peeked into Nicky’s room, half expecting to see him curled up in bed, but of course, he wasn’t there. He was still with his dad. She lingered in the doorway for a moment, staring at the empty bed, the neatly arranged toys, the colorful posters on the walls. Nicky’s room was a sanctuary, a reminder of the life she had built, the life she was supposed to be living. But now it felt like a lie.</p><p>She checked Nat’s room next, though she already knew probably wasn’t home yet. The bed was neatly made, the room untouched. Nat was still out as expected, probably still at the strip club or at an after-party, she probably haven't even read her message yet. Agatha sighed, running a hand through her damp hair. She didn’t have the energy to worry about Nat right now. She didn’t have the energy to worry about anything except getting through the next few hours.</p><p>Sleep. She needed sleep. If she could just close her eyes for a few hours, maybe she could wake up feeling like herself again. Maybe she could pretend last night never happened.</p><p>Agatha rummaged through the bathroom cabinet, her fingers closing around a small bottle of sleeping pills. She shook two into her palm and stared at them for a moment, hesitating. She hated relying on medication, hated the way it made her feel groggy and disconnected. But right now, groggy and disconnected sounded like a blessing.</p><p>She swallowed the pills dry, wincing at the bitter taste, and stumbled back to her room. She collapsed onto the bed, not bothering to change out of her towel. The room spun slightly as she closed her eyes, the pills already starting to take effect. She clung to the hope that sleep would bring her some kind of peace, even if it was only temporary.</p><p>When Agatha woke up, the sunlight streaming through the blinds felt like an assault. She groaned, squinting at the clock. 8:32 AM. She had slept for a few hours, but it didn’t feel like enough. Her head was foggy, her body still heavy with exhaustion. She dragged herself out of bed, the towel slipping off as she reached for a pair of sweatpants and an old t-shirt. She didn’t bother looking in the mirror. She didn’t want to see the mess she knew was staring back at her.</p><p>The house was still quiet, the only sound was the faint hum of the refrigerator. Agatha shuffled into the kitchen, her stomach growling despite the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. She needed to eat something, even if the thought of food made her nauseous.</p><p>She padded down the hall toward Nat’s room, cracking the door open just enough to peek inside. The bed was still perfectly made, the room untouched. Nat hadn’t come home. Agatha exhaled slowly, not sure if she felt relieved or irritated. Either way, she didn’t have the energy to deal with it. She didn’t have the energy for much of anything. Her phone sat face down on the couch where she’d left it, still powered off. She couldn’t bring herself to turn it back on, not yet.</p><p>She made her way into the kitchen. Her mind, however, was far from the kitchen. It kept circling back to Rio, to the kiss, to the way she had run out like a coward. And now, a new fear was clawing its way into her thoughts.</p><p>
<em> What if Rio told Mariah, or Wanda? Jesus even Nat </em>
</p><p>The thought hit her like a punch to the gut, and she dropped her fork with a clatter. Her chest tightened, her breathing turning shallow as panic surged through her. Rio was close with Wanda and Mariah. They were all part of the same tight-knit group, always laughing and sharing secrets. If Rio had told them, if they knew—</p><p>Agatha’s hands gripped the edge of the counter, her knuckles turning white. She couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t think. The walls of the kitchen seemed to close in around her, the air thick and suffocating. What would they think of her? What would they say? Mariah had always been so open, so unapologetically herself, but Agatha wasn’t like that. She couldn’t be. And Nat… Nat would never let her live it down. She’d make jokes, tease her mercilessly, and Agatha wouldn’t be able to handle it. She wouldn’t be able to handle any of it.</p><p>“No, no, no,” she whispered to herself, her voice trembling. “She wouldn’t tell them. She wouldn’t.”</p><p>But the doubt was already there, gnawing at her. Rio had looked so wrecked when Agatha left, so hurt. What if she had gone straight to Nat and Mariah for comfort? What if they were all talking about her right now, laughing at her, judging her?</p><p>Agatha’s legs gave out, and she slid to the floor, her back pressed against the cabinets. She buried her face in her hands, trying to steady her breathing, but it was no use. The panic was too much, too overwhelming. She felt like she was drowning, like the weight of her own fear was crushing her.</p><p>But she couldn’t stay here. She couldn’t fall apart. Not now. Not with Nicky’s party just hours away. She had promised him it would be perfect, and she wasn’t about to let him down because of her own mess.</p><p>Agatha took a deep, shuddering breath, forcing herself to focus. She counted to five, then exhaled slowly, repeating the process until her breathing evened out. Her hands still trembled, but she clenched them into fists, pressing her nails into her palms to ground herself.</p><p>She pushed herself to her feet, her legs shaky but holding.</p><p>She opened the fridge and stared blankly at its contents. There wasn’t much. A half-empty carton of eggs, a few slices of bread, some wilted lettuce. She grabbed the eggs and bread, deciding toast and scrambled eggs would have to do. </p><p>Agatha picked at her eggs, her stomach twisting with every bite. The food tasted like ash in her mouth, but she forced herself to eat, knowing she needed the energy for the day ahead.</p><p>Agatha was halfway through forcing down a piece of dry toast when she heard the front door open. The handle rattled, followed by a long pause, then a muffled curse. A thud. More cursing. Finally, the door swung open, and someone stumbled inside, the sound of boots clumsily hitting the floor filling the quiet house.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even need to look.</p><p>Nat.</p><p>She took her time chewing, listening as Nat shuffled down the hall, bumping into at least two things along the way before finally making it to the kitchen. When Nat appeared in the doorway, Agatha let her gaze drag over her, unimpressed.</p><p>Her hair was a complete disaster, tangled in a way that suggested both bad decisions and a lack of access to a hairbrush. Her dress was wrinkled beyond saving, one strap hanging dangerously off her shoulder. And draped over her shoulders like a trophy Mariah’s leather jacket.</p><p>Agatha recognized the jacket instantly. Her stomach twisted.</p><p>Nat yawned, stretching like a cat that had spent the night rolling around in bad ideas. “Oh, hey. You’re alive.”</p><p>Agatha just took another bite of toast. “Unfortunately.”</p><p>Nat groaned dramatically, dropping into the chair across from her with all the grace of a corpse flopping into an open grave. She smashed her forehead against the table. “God, my head is killing me.”</p><p>“Shocking,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>Nat ignored her, pushing her tangled hair back, mascara smudged halfway to her temples. “Last night was insane.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the dry lump of toast in her mouth, throat suddenly tight. "Yeah?"</p><p>Nat lifted her head just enough to squint at her. "Uh, yeah? You tell me. One second, you’re there, the next…poof.Vanished into thin air."</p><p>Agatha just sipped her coffee.</p><p>Nat narrowed her eyes. “You didn’t even answer my texts.”</p><p>“I did text you.”</p><p>“Yeah—‘I left.’” Nat held up air quotes, her voice dripping with mockery. “Very informative.”</p><p>She leaned back, stretching lazily. “At least you didn’t spend the night alone, right?”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her coffee. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Nat gave her a look. “You vanished. No explanation, no nothing. It was a classic horror movie move… poof… and the main character is just gone.” She rubbed her forehead, groaning. “Mariah thought maybe you met someone and finally decided it was time to get laid for once, but I guess she was wrong. I kinda thought you did too, hell, I hoped you did.”</p><p>She yawned, then added casually, “I know Rio would’ve thought the same. You know… if she was with us.”</p><p>Agatha froze. “…She wasn’t with you?”</p><p>“Nope.” Nat sighed. “She disappeared, too, so…”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on her mug tightened slightly.</p><p>“Oh?” she said, carefully neutral.</p><p>“Yeah. No idea where she went. One second she was there, the next she wasn't. Kind of like you.”</p><p>Nat lifted her head now, watching Agatha with a look that was just a little too knowing.</p><p>Agatha forced a shrug. “Maybe she went home.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Nat tilted her head, squinting at her like a detective in a bad cop drama.</p><p>A beat passed. Then she sighed and stretched, draping herself over the chair like a woman who had barely survived a war. “Anyway, I was too drunk to care at the time, and, well…” She smirked, tugging at the edges of the leather jacket. “One thing led to another.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “So you’re hooking up with one of my only friends here. Excellent job.”</p><p>“Correction,” Nat said, holding up a finger. “I hooked up with Mariah. Past tense. It’s already happened. No take-backs.”</p><p>Agatha peeked at her through her fingers. “Please tell me you’re joking.”</p><p>“Do I look like I’m joking?” Nat gestured to her disheveled state. “Because I feel like the evidence speaks for itself.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand down her face. “This is a nightmare.”</p><p>“No, this is progress,” Nat corrected. “The flirting worked. You should be proud of me.”</p><p>“Proud?” Agatha repeated, incredulous. “Nat, she’s my colleague. I have to see her at work. Do you have any idea how awkward that’s going to be?”</p><p>Nat shrugged, completely unbothered. “Not my problem.”</p><p>“It is your problem!” Agatha snapped. “You’re the one who—” She stopped herself, inhaling sharply. “Never mind. I don’t even want to know.”</p><p>Nat smirked. “Oh, come on. Don’t be such a prude. It’s not like I’m going to show up at the hospital and start making out with her in the break room.”</p><p>Agatha glared. “You better not.”</p><p>“No promises,” Nat said with a wink. She grinned, clearly pleased with herself. “Mariah’s a menace, by the way. I mean, I knew that, obviously, but my God. She’s got, like, bossy energy, you know? The kind that makes you reconsider your entire life. I think she might have hypnotized me.”</p><p>Agatha stared. “Yeah, that sounds horrifying.”</p><p>Nat waggled her eyebrows. “Oh, it was.”</p><p>Agatha just picked up her coffee and took a slow, deliberate sip. But her mind was stuck on one thing.</p><p>
<em> Rio disappeared, too. </em>
</p><p>Had Rio left because of her? Had she said anything? Told them anything? Had she found somebody else to take home?</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, forcing her focus back. “So, what happened after I left? Please leave out the nasty details, I don’t want to hear them.”</p><p>Nat’s face lit up. “Oh, it was wild, and you’re boring. Anyway, I got into a drinking contest with some guy, which I obviously won. Mariah started a conga line, and I may or may not have stolen a bottle of tequila from the bar.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You’re kidding.”</p><p>“Nope,” Nat said, popping the ‘p.’ “It’s in my purse if you want a shot.”</p><p>“I’m good,” Agatha said dryly. “But thanks.”</p><p>Nat grinned. “Your loss.”</p><p>She drummed her fingers on the table, watching Agatha a little too closely. “So…what about you? You seemed… tense last night.”</p><p>Agatha shot up from her chair. “I need to clean.”</p><p>Nat frowned. “Uh, okay?”</p><p>“Nicky’s birthday is today,” Agatha reminded her sharply. “Remember Nicky? My son? The whole reason you’re here right now?”</p><p>Nat groaned. “I made it in time, didn’t I?”</p><p>“Barely.” Agatha wrinkled her nose. “And for the love of God, go take a shower. And use some makeup to cover those hickeys.”</p><p>Nat snorted. “These are my trophies. I’m not covering shit.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, unable to suppress a small smile despite herself. “You’re impossible, you know that?”</p><p>“And yet, you keep me around,” Nat said, stretching. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to take a shower and wash off last night’s good decisions.”</p><p>“Good luck with that,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Nat winked. “Thanks. I’ll need it.”</p><p>As she disappeared down the hall, Agatha let out a long sigh, rubbing her temple.</p><p>She still didn’t know if Rio had said anything.</p><p>But at least, for now, Nat seemed clueless.</p><p>She just had to get through the day without spiraling.</p><p>The kitchen was a mess. Dirty dishes piled in the sink, crumbs scattered across the counter, the trash overflowing with the eggs she had just thrown away. It was as good a place to start as any.</p><p>Agatha grabbed a sponge and turned on the faucet, the sound of running water filling the silence. She scrubbed at the dishes with a ferocity that surprised even herself, her movements sharp and deliberate. The physical act of cleaning helped, giving her something to focus on, something to channel her restless energy into. </p><p>By the time the kitchen was spotless, her hands were raw and red, but she felt a little more in control.  She moved on to the living room, straightening pillows, vacuuming the carpet, and wiping down surfaces. The repetitive motions were soothing, almost meditative, and for a while, she managed to push her worries to the back of her mind. </p><p>Nat wandered into the living room, freshly showered, her damp hair piled messily on top of her head. She had traded last night’s wrinkled dress for a pair of sweatpants and one of Agatha’s hoodies, the one she had explicitly told her <em> not </em> to steal.</p><p>She flopped onto the couch with a dramatic sigh. “Okay, I’m clean. I’m alive. And I’m officially awake enough to pretend I’m useful. What do you need me to do?”</p><p>Agatha, still wiping down the coffee table with more force than necessary, barely looked up. “You can start by receiving the deliveries. Decorations should be here any minute, and the food and cake won’t be far behind.”</p><p>Nat groaned. “Ugh, manual labor?”</p><p>“Yes, because opening a door and taking boxes is <em> so </em> physically demanding.”</p><p>Nat stretched her legs across the couch, making herself comfortable. “You know, I <em> could </em> just say I have a hangover and be completely useless all day. But because I love you, I’m willing to suffer through the <em> immense hardship </em> of standing up and grabbing packages.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smirked despite herself. “Truly, your sacrifice is admirable.”</p><p>Nat pointed at her. “Damn right it is.”</p><p>She glanced at the clock. “So, we’ve got… what? Three hours ‘til Nicky gets here, and five before the rest of the guests start showing up?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Nat exhaled, tilting her head back. “Okay. I can handle this. I can be responsible. I can—” She cut herself off, suddenly perking up. “Wait. Is there a bouncy house? Because I feel like, as the fun aunt, I should get first dibs.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No bouncy house.”</p><p>Nat gasped, clutching her chest. “What kind of <em> monster </em> deprives a child of a bouncy house on their birthday?”</p><p>“One with limited space and a realistic budget,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>Nat clicked her tongue. “Tragic. Truly tragic. Nicky deserves better.”</p><p>Agatha threw a pillow at her. “Shut up and go wait for the packages.”</p><p>Nat caught it with a grin, then reluctantly pulled herself off the couch. “Fine, fine. But I’m stealing a cupcake as payment for my labor.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh as Nat wandered toward the door, already pulling out her phone. For the first time since last night, the weight on her chest felt just a little lighter.</p><p>By some miracle—or sheer force of will—everything was ready in time.</p><p>The living room had transformed from its usual cozy but chaotic state into something almost Pinterest-worthy. Blue and green streamers hung from the ceiling, twisting together like vines, and a big <b>Happy Birthday, Nicky!</b> banner stretched across the wall. Cartoon dinosaur cutouts, because Nicky was in his dinosaur phase, were taped to every surface, giving the place an oddly prehistoric feel. A giant T-Rex balloon loomed in the corner, looking vaguely threatening, and a smaller herd of balloon dinosaurs was scattered around the room like a migration had just passed through.</p><p>The food was set up on the dining table, with neatly arranged trays of snacks, sandwiches, and, because Agatha knew her son, the emergency backup nuggets. The birthday cake, a carefully decorated masterpiece featuring a very enthusiastic-looking stegosaurus, sat proudly in the center.</p><p>Nat surveyed the finished setup, nodding in approval. “I gotta say, Aggie, I was expecting way more of a trainwreck.”</p><p>Agatha, standing in the middle of it all, arms crossed, sighed. “Thanks for the faith.”</p><p>“I mean it! This looks, like, competent.” Nat gestured around. “Kid’s gonna lose his little mind.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, letting herself relax for the first time all morning. “Let’s hope.”</p><p>Then Nat squinted at her. “Okay, so you do realize you still look like a haunted Victorian ghost, right?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You’ve been running around like a lunatic all morning, and now you look like one.” Nat waved a hand at her. “Hair? Mess. Clothes? Somehow wrinkled despite being clean. Face? That’s just your face, but it could use a little help.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I don’t have time to—”</p><p>“You do have time,” Nat cut in. “Nicky’s not here yet, and I refuse to let you greet your ex-husband looking like you just crawled out of a crypt.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened at the mention of Daniel. “Right. He’s coming.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I need to be mentally prepared for that,” Nat said, cracking her knuckles. “Might be a good time to revisit my murder alibi collection.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smirked. “I’m going to go change before you actually get yourself arrested.”</p><p>“Good call,” Nat said, already pulling up something on her phone. “But just so you know, if he so much as <em> breathes wrong, </em> I <em> will </em> be launching him into the sun.</p><p>—----</p><p>Agatha, now in her room, quickly swapped out her sweatpants for a simple but flattering dress, a deep blue that brought out her eyes. She brushed through her hair, letting it fall naturally around her shoulders, and even dabbed on a bit of makeup. Nothing too much, just enough to make it look like she <em> hadn’t </em> been stress cleaning and overthinking for hours.</p><p>When she returned to the living room, Nat let out a low whistle. “Damn, okay, Miss Effort.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “I’m trying to look like a functional adult, not impress anyone.”</p><p>Nat smirked. “Sure. And I totally didn’t see you checking yourself out in the hallway mirror just now.”</p><p>Agatha ignored that. “What time is it?”</p><p>Nat checked her phone. “Daniel should be here soon.” She cracked her neck. “Do I need to be on my best behavior, or can I call him a bastard to his face?”</p><p>“Nat.” Agatha warned, giving her a sharp look.</p><p>“What?” Nat spread her hands innocently. “I’m just asking. I mean, the guy is the worst.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I know, but this isn’t about him. It’s about Nicky. I don’t want today turning into a thing.”</p><p>Nat groaned. “Fine. I’ll behave. <em> Mostly. </em>”</p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Nat huffed. “No violence. No dramatic insults. I won’t even bring up the fact that his entire existence is a crime against humanity.”</p><p>“Nat.”</p><p>“I said I’ll behave!” Nat raised her hands in mock surrender.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, but she was laughing. “This is going to be a long afternoon.”</p><p>“Yep,” Nat said, stretching her arms behind her head with a wicked grin. “But at least it’ll be <em> entertaining </em>.”</p><p>Just then, the sound of the doorbell broke through their banter. Both women froze, and for a moment, it felt like the calm before a storm.</p><p>“That’s him,” Agatha said, heart racing a little.</p><p>“Showtime,” Nat said, getting up from the couch with a dramatic flair, as if stepping into a role on stage.</p><p>Agatha made her way to the door, her breath catching in her chest. She opened it, and there he was. Daniel.</p><p>The first thing Agatha noticed was how <em> normal </em> he looked. His hair was neatly styled, and he was dressed in a perfectly ironed shirt and a pair of expensive jeans, the kind that screamed “I’m too busy for basic decency but I still want to look like I <em> could </em> care.” The casualness of his presence always grated on Agatha’s nerves.</p><p>“Hey,” Daniel said, flashing a smile that felt a little too rehearsed.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said, stepping aside so he could come in. “Where's my son?"</p><p>Before Daniel could respond, a small voice rang out from behind him.</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky’s voice cut through the air, and moments later, he appeared, eyes lighting up as soon as he saw Nat standing behind Agatha.</p><p>“NAT!” Nicky squealed, excitement bubbling out of him. Without a second thought, he ran straight toward her, arms flung wide.</p><p>Nat didn’t miss a beat. She grinned wickedly and scooped him up into the air with all the enthusiasm of someone who hadn't seen their favorite little person in ages. "My favorite little human!" she declared, tossing him into the air just enough for him to giggle like a maniac.</p><p>“Again! Again!” Nicky laughed, and Nat obeyed, throwing him up a second time, making him squeal even louder.</p><p>Agatha, watching the scene, couldn’t help but smile despite herself. Nicky was absolutely thrilled, and it was clear that Nat was very good at keeping him entertained. </p><p>Meanwhile, Daniel, who had stepped back to give them space, looked not pleased. The stiffness in his posture was evident, but he kept it to himself. He didn’t even try to hide the annoyance that flickered across his face as he watched Nicky and Nat bond so effortlessly.</p><p>“Oh, so now you’re the fun aunt, huh?” he said, trying to sound casual, but his tone held a certain edge that Agatha knew all too well. He had always hated how easy Nat could connect with Nicky.</p><p>Nat, still holding Nicky, gave Daniel a long, pointed look before grinning widely. “What can I say? I’m the cool one,” she said, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm as she bounced Nicky up and down.</p><p>Daniel’s lips tightened, clearly irked, but he said nothing. Instead, he adjusted his posture and turned his attention back to Agatha. “Everything’s set for the lunch later?” he asked, as if this whole situation was entirely normal.</p><p>Agatha nodded, trying her best to act like everything was just fine. “Yeah, everything’s good. The cake and food should be here soon, and the decorations are all set up.”</p><p>“Good,” Daniel replied curtly, his gaze lingering on Nicky and Nat, who were still engaged in their little back-and-forth of laughter and playful antics. “I don’t want things to get out of hand. Last time—”</p><p>“Oh, please,” Nat cut in with a grin, still holding Nicky like he was the most precious thing in the world. “If anyone’s going to ‘get out of hand,’ it’s probably you. I’m just here for the cake.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at the absurdity of it all. It was always the same with Daniel, so self-important, so insistent on the idea that he had everything figured out. And Nat? Well, Nat was here to make sure it all stayed interesting.</p><p>“Maybe you should take some notes,” Nat added to Daniel with a sly smirk. </p><p>Daniel's face turned a shade of red that was too close to anger for Agatha’s liking, but she decided it was time to steer things in a more peaceful direction.</p><p>“Okay, guys. Let’s just… not make this a thing today, alright? We’ve got a whole afternoon ahead of us,” she said, trying to force some calm into the situation.</p><p>Nat, clearly relishing the tension, winked at Daniel. “Don’t worry, Daniel. I’ll make sure you get some attention too. Maybe you’ll even have a moment to show off how much you care,” she teased, making Agatha bite back a smile.</p><p>Daniel’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t say anything. He just shot one last look at Agatha before turning his attention back to Nicky and Nat, who had managed to break free from their playful exchange and now stood at the doorway of the living room, ready to begin the day.</p><p>Agatha smiled down at Nicky, who was still buzzing with excitement, his small hands tugging at the edge of Nat's leather jacket as if trying to climb back into her arms.</p><p>"Alright, buddy," she said, crouching down to his level. "You can’t run around in your pajamas all day, can you?"</p><p>Nicky’s face scrunched up in confusion. "But I like my pajamas..."</p><p>"I know, buddy, but today’s a special day," Nat said with an exaggerated wink. "You gotta look sharp for your big party. Now, go get dressed and make sure you pick something cool, alright? The coolest clothes you've got."</p><p>Nicky’s eyes lit up at the idea. "Okay!" he said, already darting off toward his room without another word.</p><p>Nat, standing behind Agatha, eyed Daniel with an unreadable expression. Then she smiled sweetly. “So, Daniel. How’s the whole living in your perfect little world with no consequences thing going?”</p><p>Daniel blinked, caught off guard. Agatha winced. Of course, Nat wouldn’t hold back.</p><p>“I… uh, good, I guess?” Daniel said, clearly not knowing what to make of Nat’s bluntness.</p><p>“Good to hear,” Nat said, a little too cheerfully. “Glad to see the moral bankruptcy isn’t taking too much of a toll on you.”</p><p>Daniel exhaled slowly, as if he were <em> really </em> trying to be the bigger person. "You know, Natasha, it’s always a pleasure."</p><p>"Aw, Danny, I bet you say that to all the women who can’t stand you," Nat cooed, tilting her head.</p><p>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. "Alright, children, play nice."</p><p>Nat raised her hands in mock innocence. "I <em> am </em> playing nice. I haven’t even mentioned the part where he—"</p><p>"Nat," Agatha cut in sharply, giving her a pointed look.</p><p>Nat huffed but crossed her arms, clearly restraining herself. Daniel shifted uncomfortably, his jaw tight.</p><p>“I’m just here for Nicky,” he said finally, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. "Oh, trust me, we know. Otherwise, I doubt you’d ever set foot in this house again."</p><p>Daniel flinched, just barely, but it was enough to satisfy her.</p><p>"Alright," he said, exhaling as if <em> he </em> were the victim here. "I get it. I’m the bad guy. Always have been, always will be."</p><p>Nat smiled. "Wow, look at that, Agatha. He’s finally developing some self awareness. Maybe there is hope for him after all."</p><p>"Baby steps," Agatha murmured.</p><p>Daniel’s eyes darted between them, clearly debating whether it was worth engaging. He sighed. "Are we done? Or do you two want to get a few more punches in before lunch?"</p><p>Nat smirked. "I mean, I could go on, but Nicky might come back, and I wouldn’t want to damage his perception of his very responsible father."</p><p>Daniel shot her a flat look.</p><p>Agatha exhaled dramatically. "Fine. Truce. For now."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Nat said, waving a hand. "But if you do start acting like a condescending prick at lunch, I reserve the right to stab you with a butter knife."</p><p>Daniel sighed again, as if resigning himself to his fate. "I’ll be on my best behavior."</p><p>"You better," Agatha said, setting her coffee down. "Because I will take Nicky’s side in any argument, and we both know that kid can hold a grudge like no other."</p><p>Daniel looked genuinely nervous at that. "Noted."</p><p>Nat grinned, satisfied. "Good. Now, let’s go pretend we’re normal, functional adults until cake time."</p><p>—-- </p><p>Lunch was a tense but relatively civil affair, mostly because Nicky was too excited about his birthday to notice the subtle barbs being exchanged over the table. Daniel, to his credit, kept his mouth shut and focused on Nicky, while Nat made a point of cutting her steak just a little too aggressively every time he spoke. Agatha, exhausted from both keeping the peace and making sure Nat didn’t actually stab anyone with a butter knife, focused on finishing her food in record time. The second they were done, she all but leapt from her seat under the pretense of checking on the decorations, relieved that the real event was about to start.</p><p>Just as she set out the last of the party favors, the doorbell rang.</p><p>"Showtime," Nat muttered, stretching her arms like she was preparing for battle.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and went to open the door, only to be immediately bombarded by a chorus of greetings as the first wave of guests arrived, arms full of presents and energy levels far too high for her current state of mind.</p><p>The doorbell kept ringing through the next few minutes. </p><p>The door swung open to reveal Wanda, effortlessly put together despite wrangling two very excitable twins, and Vision, carrying a comically oversized gift bag.</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda greeted warmly, shifting slightly as Billy and Tommy shot past her like twin rockets.</p><p>"Nicky!" Billy shouted.</p><p>"Where is he?!" Tommy added.</p><p>Before Agatha could even answer, Nicky came barreling in from the living room. The moment he spotted his friends, he let out an excited yell, and the three of them collided in a chaotic tangle of limbs and laughter, nearly knocking each other over.</p><p>Agatha smirked. "Well, I guess we know who the real stars of the party are."</p><p>“They’ve been talking about this all week,” Wanda sighed, watching the kids immediately start scheming whatever disaster they were about to unleash. “I hope you don’t mind if they destroy your house.”</p><p>“It was a risk I accepted the moment I invited them,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>As Vision set the massive gift bag down by the table, Agatha gestured toward Nat, who had been watching the chaos unfold with an amused smirk.</p><p>“Wanda, Vision, this is Natasha,” Agatha said, waving lazily between them. “She’s, unfortunately, a permanent fixture in my life.”</p><p>“Rude,” Nat muttered before grinning and shaking Wanda’s hand. “Nice to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>“Oh?” Wanda arched a brow. “All good things, I hope.”</p><p>Nat shot Agatha a look. “Hmm… define ‘good.’”</p><p>Vision, ever polite, extended his hand. “It’s a pleasure, Natasha.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Nat said, shaking his hand. She eyed the oversized gift bag. “Did you guys bring an entire toy store?”</p><p>“Almost,” Wanda said, sighing. “The boys couldn’t agree on just one thing, so…”</p><p>Nat smirked. “Sounds about right.” Then, turning to Agatha, she added, “You actually have normal friends. I’m shocked.”</p><p>The party was in full swing, and Nicky was having the time of his life. Between running around with all of his friends, eating way too much cake, and unwrapping presents like a child possessed, he was practically glowing with excitement. Every gift was met with an over the top reaction, gasps, squeals, and a dramatic “THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!” that had Wanda hiding a laugh behind her hand.</p><p>Vision, ever the patient observer, helped keep the gift pile organized while the twins egged Nicky on to tear through them faster. By the time he got to Wanda and Vision’s oversized gift bag, there was already a mountain of discarded wrapping paper on the floor.</p><p>When he finally pulled out the contents, a high-tech LEGO set, a superhero costume, and a book about space, his face lit up like a Christmas tree. “THIS IS SO COOL!” he yelled, immediately throwing himself at Wanda and Vision in a grateful hug.</p><p>“We figured you’d like it,” Wanda said, ruffling his hair.</p><p>“I LOVE IT.”</p><p>Nat, watching the whole thing with an amused smirk, nudged Agatha. “Kid’s got a good racket going here. Think I could get people to buy me stuff if I started screaming about how it’s the best day ever?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “You’d be lucky to get a sympathy drink.”</p><p>“Rude,” Nat muttered, stealing a bite of cake from Agatha’s plate anyway.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha was doing an excellent job of pretending Daniel didn’t exist. She barely acknowledged him, only making the absolute necessary polite small talk when Nicky was around. Other than that, she kept herself busy, refilling drinks, keeping an eye on the kids, making sure Nat didn’t get too drunk on birthday punch (because, somehow, she absolutely would).</p><p>Wanda, however, noticed. She slid up beside Agatha while Daniel was awkwardly standing alone near the snack table. “So, avoiding your ex like the plague, huh?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even pretend to deny it. “Obviously.”</p><p>“I mean, fair,” Nat chimed in, appearing at Agatha’s other side like a devil on her shoulder. “Look at him. Just existing over there. Ugh.” She shuddered dramatically.</p><p>Wanda smirked. “God, I can’t stand men like him.”</p><p>Nat gasped. “Wanda. Are we about to bond over hating the same man?”</p><p>“I think we are,” Wanda said, pretending to wipe away a tear.</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “I regret this already.”</p><p>“Too late,” Nat said cheerfully, slinging an arm around Wanda. “Welcome to the ‘Daniel Sucks’ fan club. Meetings are every Wednesday. We bring wine.”</p><p>“I’ll bring the snacks,” Wanda said, nodding solemnly.</p><p>“Oh, I like her,” Nat declared.</p><p>Agatha just groaned, staring longingly at the cake like it could save her.</p><p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, the party slowly wound down. The kids, fueled by sugar and excitement, were starting to crash, and the adults had reached that polite, lingering phase where they pretended they weren’t ready to leave but were very much thinking about their couches.</p><p>Daniel, thankfully, had taken the hint early and left, though not before reminding Agatha, twice, that he’d be in town for the next two days to spend time with Nicky. She had nodded stiffly, keeping her answers short, and had all but shoved him out the door before he could say anything else.</p><p>Now, with the house finally quiet and most of the mess cleaned up, Nicky was curled up on the couch, rubbing his eyes. Agatha crouched down beside him. “Alright, kiddo, bedtime.”</p><p>Instead of reaching for her, Nicky turned to Nat. “Can you put me to bed?” he mumbled sleepily.</p><p>Nat’s eyes widened slightly before she grinned. “Me? Wow. Big honor.” She scooped him up effortlessly, carrying him toward his room. “Alright, let’s get you tucked in, birthday boy.”</p><p>Agatha watched them disappear down the hall, feeling an odd warmth settle in her chest. Nat had always been good with Nicky, but there was something about seeing her in full “cool aunt” mode that made Agatha… soft. Not that she’d ever admit it.</p><p>With the house finally empty, Agatha sighed and slumped onto the couch. Her eyes flickered toward her phone facedown on the coffee table. She had been avoiding it all day, dreading whatever awaited her.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she reached for it, hesitating for just a second before flipping it over. With a flick of her thumb, she pressed the power button. </p><p>The screen stayed dark for a second, just long enough to make her think maybe, just maybe, she could still back out of this. Then, with an ominous little buzz, the phone came to life.</p><p>The notifications flooded in all at once. Messages. Missed calls. A string of texts stacking on top of each other, the preview screen flashing names she wasn’t ready to see.</p><p>Agatha stared at the flood of notifications, her thumb hovering over the screen. Nope. Absolutely not. She wasn’t dealing with this right now.</p><p>Without even glancing at the messages, Agatha swiped them away and tapped on Wanda’s contact instead. The phone rang twice before Wanda picked up.</p><p>“Well, well,” Wanda teased, her voice dripping with amusement. “She lives.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, sinking further into the couch. “Barely. Just calling to say thanks again for today. Nicky had the best time.”</p><p>“Oh, please. We had just as much fun,” Wanda said. “The boys are already asking when they can come back.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “As long as they promise not to turn my living room into a wrestling ring again, they’re welcome anytime.”</p><p>“No promises,” Wanda said with a laugh.</p><p>They fell into easy conversation, trading complaints about the sugar-fueled chaos of the afternoon. For a moment, Agatha almost forgot about the mess of last night. Almost.</p><p>Then, casually, <em> too </em> casually, Wanda added, “By the way, I’m really happy for you.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Uh… thanks?”</p><p>“I mean, you’ve been so tense lately. It’s good to see you finally letting loose a little.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened. “Wanda…”</p><p>“And honestly, you were overdue,” Wanda continued, her tone far too smug. “So really, congrats.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted. There was something in Wanda’s voice, too knowing, too pleased.</p><p>She shifted on the couch, suddenly feeling like she’d walked into a trap. “Uh-huh,” she said slowly. “And… what exactly am I being congratulated for?”</p><p>Wanda let out a soft hum, like she was savoring the moment. “Oh, you know,” she said lightly. “Finally getting some.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her brain stalled, her breath catching in her throat. “I—what?”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “Oh, don’t be shy. It’s about time, really. I was starting to think you’d taken a vow of celibacy.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it.</p><p>Her mind raced. What did Wanda know? Was she guessing? Was she messing with her?</p><p>Agatha swallowed, pulse pounding in her ears. “Wanda,” she said carefully, “where exactly did you hear that?”</p><p>Wanda’s laughter was warm, teasing.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, “I have my sources.”</p><p><br/>

<p>
<span>Agatha’s heart started hammering in her chest. Her grip on the phone tightened as panic crept in, sharp and sudden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind raced, replaying every second of the night before. Had Rio said something? Had someone seen them? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up straighter on the couch, fingers gripping the phone so tightly her knuckles went white. She forced out a laugh, strained and brittle. “I… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda made a low, amused sound on the other end. “Mmhm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t—” Agatha’s voice caught, panic bubbling under the surface. “I mean, I wouldn’t—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You so would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart slammed against her ribs. “Wanda, I did not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Wanda cut in, clearly enjoying herself. “I’m not interrogating you, Agatha. I just noticed a little something during Nickys party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, mind spinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What... what little something?” she asked, her voice pitching a little too high.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda made a thoughtful noise, like she was savoring dragging this out. “Well, it could’ve been the way you were avoiding eye contact all afternoon… or how you practically sprinted away whenever someone mentioned last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse thudded in her ears. Another pause. Then Wanda’s voice came through sweet and sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But,” Wanda drawled, “if I had to guess… I’d say it was the hickey on your neck that gave it away, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach plummeted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her free hand shot to her neck on instinct, fingers brushing against the soft skin just beneath her collarbone, the exact spot Rio’s mouth had lingered.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, but nothing came out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s soft laugh filled the silence. “I knew it,” she sing songed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's mind short-circuited between full on panic and the urge to throw her phone out the nearest window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Goddamn it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed outright at her silence. “So? Are you gonna tell me who the lucky one is, or do I have to bribe Nat for the gossip?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's mind short circuited between full on panic and the urge to throw her phone out the nearest window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” she hissed, trying to salvage some dignity. “It’s—it's not what you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” Wanda teased. Right. Because you accidentally got bitten on the neck? Happens all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, heat prickling at the back of her neck, cursing herself for not checking the mirror more closely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice softened, teasing but warm. “I’m happy for you, Agatha. Really. It’s about time someone knocked that chip off your shoulder, at least for one night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If only Wanda knew who was responsible for the maroon mark she </span>
<span>saw near her collarbone… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely heard whatever Wanda was saying next. Her mind was too busy rewinding, rewinding to every damn interaction she’d had today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Wanda saw it, probably everyone had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then it hit her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat saw it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat had to have seen it. And she had let her walk all day with the damn mark on her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That fucking bitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eye twitched, her grip on the phone tightening. </span>
<b>Oh, she was going to kill her.</b>
<span> Slowly. Painfully. Maybe she’d start by poisoning her coffee, nothing lethal, just enough to make her suffer. Then she’d move on to more creative punishments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The audacity. The absolute gall of that woman. Marking her like she was some possession. As if Agatha wouldn't notice. As if she wouldn’t wake up, see the evidence, and lose her entire goddamn mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was going to kill both of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But first—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ve had enough of your shit,” Agatha cut Wanda off, voice dry as sandpaper. “Enjoy your little fantasy, Maximoff, but I am hanging up now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was still laughing when Agatha stabbed at the red icon on her screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a slow, deep inhale, she let her phone drop onto the couch beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she started brainstorming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Snarky responses. She needed a shield, something to throw at Wanda next time she opened her mouth with that smug tone. Something witty, something cutting—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could settle on a solid comeback, rage overtook logic when she came back to Nat. She knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That sneaky, smug, traitorous little—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot up from the couch, hands clenched into fists. Then, in a voice loud enough to shake the walls, she roared:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“NATASHA ROMANOFF, GET YOUR ASS IN HERE!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat strolled in with the casual confidence of someone who knew they were in trouble but had absolutely no intention of apologizing for it. She leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, lips curled into the smuggest smirk Agatha had ever seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s up, sunshine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, still fuming, narrowed her eyes. “You know exactly what’s up, you absolute menace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat blinked, all wide eyed innocence. “I really don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pointed an accusatory finger at her neck. “Oh, really? Then explain why Wanda just congratulated me for getting laid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat gasped dramatically, pressing a hand to her chest. “Wanda knows? Wow. Word travels fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t you start.” Agatha marched up to her, stabbing her finger into Nat’s shoulder. “You knew. You saw it, and you didn’t say a damn thing. You let me walk around all day with—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With receipts?” Nat finished for her, grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a strangled noise that was somewhere between a growl and a scream. “I swear to God—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat cut her off by poking her cheek. “Look at you, getting all worked up over a little love bite. It’s adorable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swatted her hand away. “Do you have a death wish?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat grinned. “Not particularly, but if I did, I’d want you to be the one to take me out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, dragging her hands down her face. “I should kill you. I should—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—Be thanking me?” Nat suggested. “Because I totally covered for you, by the way. Wanda asked if I knew anything, and I played dumb.” She paused “well technically I don't know anything because you refuse to tell me who it was but the evidence speak for it self”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are dumb.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow. Hurtful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, arms crossed tightly. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat shrugged, grinning. “Listen, I’m just happy you’re out there.” Her voice softened, just a little. “you deserved a moment to finally let loose. After everything…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, caught between irritation and something heavier, something she wasn’t ready to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat, as always, was too perceptive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nudged Agatha’s arm lightly. “So? You gonna tell me who it was?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat sighed dramatically. “Fine. Be mysterious. But if you start getting cryptic poetry texts from you at three in the morning, I will know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and shoved Nat toward the door. “Out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat laughed as she went, tossing one last grin over her shoulder. “Hey, just a little advice, next time check a mirror before facing the public.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up a throw pillow and launched it at her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With Nat finally gone, Agatha exhaled and collapsed onto the couch. Her phone sat on the table, still waiting, still taunting her. She had been putting it off long enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alright. Just rip the band-aid off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed it, unlocking the screen with a swipe of her thumb. The notifications blinked back at her, texts from Wanda, a few from some other acquaintances, an email about some book event she definitely wasn’t attending.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But nothing from her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip on the phone tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the screen, waiting, as if something might magically appear just because she willed it hard enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her jaw clenched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The realization settled like a stone in her gut. She scrolled, refreshed her messages, even checked her missed calls, as if maybe, somehow, she’d just overlooked it. Maybe there was a single text hidden between all the others, half-hearted, so that happened waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a damn thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her jaw clenched.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. Oh, so that’s how we’re playing this?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure what she had expected. She had spent the entire day dreading the moment she’d turn on her phone, bracing herself for whatever fresh chaos Rio would throw at her. A smug, knowing text. A cryptic message. A simple, Did you dream about me?, the kind of thing that would’ve sent her spiraling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, now that it wasn’t there… she felt something almost worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that it wasn’t here, she was mad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was the one who ran. The one who left without a word, without so much as a glance back. She had been the one to decide there was nothing left to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why did it piss her off that Rio was acting like she agreed?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t even about the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>…Except that was a lie, wasn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because that was the moment burned into her skull. The way Rio had kissed her, the way she had looked at her afterward, with something dark and knowing in her eyes, something that told Agatha that Rio had seen everything. Every hesitation, every shaky inhale, every damn thing she didn’t want her to see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha had run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t thought, hadn’t processed, just bolted before Rio could say anything, before she could smirk and make some biting little comment about how Agatha had wanted it. Because she had, and that was the worst part.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted Rio to have texted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not because she wanted to talk. Not because she had anything to say. But because, what? Rio got to decide they weren’t speaking? Rio got to just move on like nothing happened?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath, tossing the phone onto the couch beside her like it had personally offended her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was stupid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had gotten exactly what she wanted all along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t texting her. She was leaving her alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No sly messages, no teasing, no dragging her into some exhausting push and pull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was what Agatha had wanted. What she had told herself she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why did it feel like losing?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand down her face, exhaling sharply. This was pathetic. She should be relieved. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She was relieved. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>This was the best possible outcome. It meant she could pretend last night never happened, could file it away under reckless, stupid mistakes and move on like she always did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, that gnawing irritation wouldn’t leave her alone. Because, no matter how much she wanted to deny it, a small, irrational part of her wanted Rio to have texted. To have acknowledged it, something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because now it felt like Rio had decided it didn’t matter. Like she was the one brushing it off, moving on without a second thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that, somehow, was even worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—---------------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sunday was a blur of movement and noise; exactly what Agatha needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She, Nat, and Nicky spent the afternoon at the ice rink, where Nicky wobbled around on skates with a mix of excitement and frustration while Nat, ever the show-off, glided effortlessly across the ice. Agatha stuck to the sidelines, coaching Nicky through his attempts while Nat took every opportunity to spin and skate backward just to be annoying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After that, they grabbed hot chocolate to warm up before heading to the cinema. Nicky insisted on getting the biggest popcorn available, which resulted in half of it ending up on the floor before the previews even finished. Nat kept up a running sarcastic commentary on the movie, whispering dramatic gasps at predictable plot twists while Nicky giggled beside her. Agatha let herself get lost in it, the warmth, the noise, the simplicity of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a whole day, she didn’t think about Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Monday was coming. And with it, the inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat was staying with Nicky all week, which meant Agatha had no excuse. She had to go back to work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she had to see </span>
<em>
<span>her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>—-----------</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Monday arrived far too soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the ceiling of her bedroom, the early morning light filtering through her blinds, and seriously considered calling in sick. Her throat wasn’t sore, her head didn’t hurt, and she wasn’t even remotely ill, but surely, there had to be some kind of medical exception for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could call in sick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just roll over, grab her phone, and fire off a quick email. It would be easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except she didn’t call in sick. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ever</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was happening to her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was Agatha Harkness, for God’s sake. One of the top OB-GYNs in the country, maybe the world, depending on who you asked. She had trained under the best, delivered hundreds of babies, and performed some of the most complicated surgeries imaginable. She had been in life-or-death situations more times than she could count.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, here she was, lying in bed like a coward because she had kissed one of her colleagues.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stupid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t some flustered teen sneaking glances at a crush across the high school floor. She was a grown woman, a damn good doctor, and she had worked too hard for too long to let something as ridiculous as this shake her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why did it feel like she was standing at the edge of a cliff?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, pressing the heels of her hands into her eyes. She was mad. Furious, even. At Rio. At herself. At the entire ridiculous situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to march into work, track Rio down, and…..what? Demand an explanation? Pretend it never happened? Kiss her again just to make a point? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled sharply and sat up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No. She was being ridiculous. She needed to get a grip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had a job to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she sure as hell wasn’t going to let Rio Vidal (or herself) get in the way of that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She should be able to walk into that hospital like nothing had happened. Like it was just another Monday. But instead, there was this… gnawing, twisting thing in her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sharp exhale, she shoved the blankets off and forced herself out of bed. She had a job to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if she had to see Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, she would just have to act like she didn’t care. Cuz it was true. She didn't. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved on autopilot through her morning routine, determined not to let anything, not even the mess in her head, ruin her day. She kissed Nicky on the forehead, ruffled his hair, and ignored the way he grumbled about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Be good for Nat, alright?" she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m always good," Nicky declared, already focused on his cereal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat snorted. "Debatable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. "See you later, troublemaker."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have fun at work!" Nat called after her with an exaggerated wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped her off on her way out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive to the hospital was uneventful, but her grip on the steering wheel was tight the whole way. She was fine. She was completely, absolutely fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, just as she pulled into the parking lot, her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the screen. </span>
<em>
<span>Dr. Calderu.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha; How are you?? I need to see you at my office before rounds”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's stomach twisted. Lilia wasn’t the kind of person to waste time with unnecessary meetings. Whatever this was, it was important. And important in a hospital usually meant bad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she grabbed her coat and strode inside the hospital, heading straight for Lilia’s office. When she arrived, the door was ajar, and to her shock, there was already someone sitting in the office. For a moment she stopped breathing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because sitting there, legs crossed, poised like she belonged in the pages of a high-fashion magazine,,was Rio, wearing a dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A deep green one that hugged her in ways that should have been illegal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was sitting in one of the chairs, legs crossed in a way that made it look like she belonged in a high end magazine. The dress was blue, hugging her body in ways Agatha was too mad to appreciate, and was borderline criminal in the best possible way. And, of course, there were the heels. High, sharp heels. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up as Agatha entered, her gaze cool and indifferent, but there was a slight twitch at the corner of her mouth, as if she were just waiting for Agatha to react.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced up at her, her expression unreadable before one perfectly arched brow lifted ever so slightly. "Ah. You"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw red; her stomach twisted. She took a breath and let it out slowly, but it didn’t help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What the hell is this?" Agatha demanded, her voice sharper than she intended. "Is this some kind of intervention? Am I being audited?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow, clearly amused by Agatha’s frustration. "Relax, Harkness I know the same as you know I presume," her smirk not meeting her eyes .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart pounded, her frustration building. "Relax? You’re sitting here—" She gestured vaguely at Rio, who was practically lounging in her chair. "dressed like you’re about to do anything but show up at a runway show, and you’re telling me to relax?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked slowly, as though she didn’t have a care in the world. "I like looking good."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was about to lose it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are you here?" she snapped. "What is going on? I got a text from Lilia, and now I walk into this ridiculousness?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Someone's in a mood" Rio said slowly without looking at her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, Agatha wanted to kill her.</span>

</p><p>
<span>Just then, the door to Lilia’s office creaked open, and she walked in, glancing between the two of them. Her eyes lingered on Agatha for a second, but she didn’t comment on the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha," Lilia greeted her coolly. "Glad you could join us."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth. This was it. She was about to explode. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia, for her part, looked perfectly at ease, but she was clearly ready to get to the point. "We need to talk," she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>About what, Agatha wanted to scream, but she was too busy wondering why she was feeling so completely out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw and turned to Lilia. "What is happening?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia leaned back in her chair. "Well, if you’d stop bickering for five seconds, I could tell you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms. "Fine. Enlighten me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed under her breath, glancing at her nails. "Yes, please, enlighten us, Dr. Calderu. Some of us have rounds to get to."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snapped her gaze back to Rio. "Oh, I’m sorry, am I inconveniencing you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitched. "A little, yes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, that was it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands twitched at her sides, resisting the urge to throw something. She wasn’t sure what was more infuriating, Rio’s complete indifference to their situation or the fact that she somehow managed to look effortlessly flawless while doing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia didn’t even blink. "Enough you two. We need to talk about the trauma certification"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. "Uh… what? That’s it?" She half expected Lilia to hand her a gold star and a congratulatory handshake. She’d been working her ass off on this certification, and she was pretty sure she’d nailed it. “ So tell us chief… Did we pass the trauma certification with flying colors? Because I’m expecting a nice little thank you for keeping the residents from imploding on each other, you know. I think we did an amazing job and- “</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No," Lilia interrupted, holding her hand up. "You and Dr. Vidal didn’t pass it with flying colors. You didn't do an amazing job. You failed half of them. Half of the other ones didn’t even finish the certification because the little stunt you two pulled in the rain"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sighed heavily. "You terrorized them. And now I’ve got complaints stacked up. You need to apologize. And not just some email or half-hearted note; face them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's eyes widened. "Wait. So, we’re not getting congratulated for our rigorous standards?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia looked like she wanted to strangle both of them. "You’re getting nothing but an apology and a reminder that we’re in a hospital, not a survivalist boot camp. You’re lucky you’re not getting suspended."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Suspended?" Agatha scoffed, throwing her hands up. "For teaching them the real pressures of being a surgeon? Please. They should be thanking us for showing them what it takes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed her arms with a smug look.  "Exactly. What’s the problem? A little rain never hurt anyone. If they can’t handle a little water and mud, maybe they should be looking for another line of work."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No," Lilia interrupted, holding up a hand. "You were not right. Two of them ended up with pneumonia."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened in disbelief. "Pneumonia?! How did they catch pneumonia from standing in the rain? What are they, delicate flowers? "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I told you it was a terrible idea," Agatha muttered, throwing a pointed glare at Rio. "But no, you had to make it dramatic—‘Let’s do trauma certification in a thunderstorm, Agatha. It’s for their character.’"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just shrugged with her signature smugness. "They were fine."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine?!" Lilia exploded. "This is not fine! We could get a lawsuit!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a single eyebrow. "The rest of them finished, right? They’re tougher than the rest of the whiners."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia shot them both an incredulous look. "Enough the two of you. Not only did you fail them but some of them have even complained about the way you terrorized them during the entire process. There’s talk about filing formal complaints."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Complaints?!" Agatha almost choked on her own frustration. "Complaints because we made them push through tough training? How is that a complaint?! When I was in residency i was put though worst"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. "They should have been able to handle a little rain. Honestly, if they can’t deal with a wet jacket and a little hypothermia, maybe they shouldn’t be in the OR."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia narrowed her eyes. "I’m serious, both of you. These residents are scared to even look at the two of you"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her hands up in the air. "What do you mean, ‘what am I going to do about it’? You want me to wrap them in cotton balls and give them a bottle of chamomile tea? Maybe a spa day to help them recover from the trauma of getting a little wet?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio folded her arms, looking amused. "Honestly, I’m starting to think they should just be grateful we didn’t make them carry the dummies uphill. You know, real trauma training. Some of them—" she paused, glancing at Agatha with a half-smile, "—just need to toughen up."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, exactly," Agatha agreed, practically waving her arms around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia blinked twice, clearly not on the same page. "If you two keep talking like this, I will personally—"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We’re just saying," Agatha interrupted with an exaggerated shrug. "If they want to be surgeons, they need to learn how to handle a little discomfort. It’s part of the job!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded sagely. "Honestly, I don’t know how anyone survives in this field without a couple of minor injuries and mental breakdowns. It builds character."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, sighing heavily. "Right. And if they can’t handle a little water and a few pushes from their attendings, they might want to rethink their career paths.."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia looked between the two of them, still unimpressed. "Both of you are ridiculous, but there’s no getting around it. You need to work on your approach, because this—" she waved her hand vaguely, "—this isn’t going to fly again. Got it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio exchanged a look. "Understood," Agatha said in a completely sarcastic tone. "We’ll be sure to ease up on the rain and trauma drills in the future. Maybe a group hug and a meditation session instead."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia didn’t laugh, but Rio did, a little too loud for Agatha’s liking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sighed deeply, rubbing her temples. "You’re both impossible. But you will apologize, or I swear I’ll make the next few months for you so brutal you’ll be begging for the rain."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp sigh. "This is ridiculous."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. "We’re sorry, Lilia. So sorry. Happy?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia shot them both a venomous look. "Not until I hear it from your lips. Apologize to the residents in person. And make it believable."</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a groan, Agatha and Rio walked out of the office. As soon as the door closed behind them, Agatha whirled on Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is your fault. You pushed for that stupid rain test. You’re the reason I’m apologizing to a bunch of crybabies who can’t even handle a little cold air."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her hands innocently. "Me? I was just trying to help them build character. Tough love as you say."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah? Well, they’ve got character. Pneumonia, too." Agatha shot her a death glare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned mischievously. "You know, I’m actually starting to enjoy this. Watching you go all ‘Oh no, my pride’ is actually a lot of fun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, exasperated. "I am not this person. I’m one of the top OB-GYNs in the county, if not the world, and now I’m here, apologizing to a bunch of whiners because of you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. "Well, if you don’t like it, maybe we can have another ‘special certification’ to help you unwind." Her voice dripped with sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop it!" Agatha snapped, turning to storm down the hall, but Rio easily matched her pace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know, Agatha, if you’re really mad about this, you could always write it in a nice, passive-aggressive email. Just start every sentence with ‘I was forced to apologize to you by my boss…’," Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I swear to God, one more word out of your mouth and I’ll strangle you with my stethoscope," Agatha muttered</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled darkly. "It’s hilarious, Agatha. I don't like this but I’m fine with it, you on the other hand, might explode with all your righteous indignation."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare. "I am not going to apologize for teaching them how to survive under pressure. It’s a skill. But here I am, caving in to this ridiculous demand from Lilia, who clearly thinks we’re running a daycare."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, you did kind of turn it into one," Rio said with a grin that could only be described as infuriating. "I mean, what’s her plan anyways? Hand them a juice box and tell them they did a great job for trying?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her teeth, trying not to snap. "Don’t even start with me. You’re the one who insisted on making them stand out in the rain like it was some kind of movie scene." Agatha growled. "I am not apologizing for your idiotic idea. You could have at least backed me up when I said this was a bad idea."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, come on," Rio said, clearly enjoying this, "it wasn’t that bad. Sure, they got pneumonia, but that’s basically a badge of honor in some circles, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop it!" Agatha hissed, but the grin on Rio’s face only made her angrier. "You know what? Fine. I’ll apologize. I’ll say ‘sorry’ to a bunch of whiny little residents who can’t take a little rain. How’s that for you, huh?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, her voice low and teasing. "I can just imagine you standing in front of them, saying, ‘Sorry for traumatizing you with the rain and having you work through it like professionals.’ It’s a masterpiece really."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look that could have melted steel. "I am doing this because Lilia said so and I actually appreciate my job and don’t think for a second I won’t make sure everyone knows this was all you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sure, sure, blame it all on me," Rio said, clearly not even phased. "That’s what you do best, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Stop it," Agatha almost shouted, but she quickly lowered her voice, glancing around to make sure no one had overheard. "This isn’t a joke."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held up her hands in mock surrender, but something was different this time. Agatha noticed it immediately. The usual infuriating smirk was absent. Rio’s expression was calm, almost neutral, and her tone lacked the playful edge Agatha had come to expect. It was unsettling, like the absence of a familiar sound in a room you’ve known your whole life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, Rio was gone, disappearing down the hallway, leaving Agatha standing there, staring after her in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind raced as she replayed the interaction. Rio hadn’t teased her. Not really. There had been no sly remarks, no lingering glances, no smug satisfaction. It was as if the </span>
<em>
<span>incident</span>
</em>
<span>  had never happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in the hallway, her chest rising and falling with the effort of keeping her composure. The absence of Rio’s usual smirk, the lack of her biting sarcasm—it was jarring. Agatha had expected a fight, a snarky comment, </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>. But instead, Rio had just… walked away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought burned hotter than any argument ever could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—----</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day passed in a blur of appointments, surgeries, and paperwork. Agatha threw herself into her work, using it as a distraction from the storm brewing in her mind. But no matter how hard she tried to focus, her thoughts kept circling back to Rio. To the way she had looked at her in the hallway. To the way she had just… walked away. She needed to do something about it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stormed down the hallway, her heels clicking against the tile with the force of her irritation. This was karma, she was sure of it. Some cruel, cosmic joke at her expense. She’d spent the last eight hours seething over Rio, wanting to see her stumble, wanting to watch her squirm—and instead, here she was, being forced to eat her words in front of a room full of whiny, pneumonia-prone residents. It was humiliating. Infuriating. She had survived worse, but this? This was a new form of torture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she wasn’t about to let Rio enjoy it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she had to apologize, she was going to do it on her terms, without Rio’s smug face hovering in the background. Let Rio miss it and look like the unprofessional one. That would be her revenge. Small, petty, but satisfying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned the corner sharply, and slammed right into Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, Harkness,” Wanda huffed, steadying herself before Agatha could knock her flat. “Where’s the fire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back, barely acknowledging her. “I have to go apologize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Wanda pause. Her brows lifted, her lips twitching. “I’m sorry, what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed through her teeth, already regretting saying anything. “You heard me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I did,” Wanda said, her grin stretching wider. “I just never thought I’d live to see the day. Agatha Harkness, apologizing?” She shook her head, her amusement practically radiating off of her. “This, I have to see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Wanda was already falling into step beside her, far too entertained to be deterred. “Oh, come on, don’t be like that. You can’t drop something this good and expect me to just walk away. Who’s the lucky soul on the receiving end of this historic event?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth. “A room full of crybabies who think rain is a trauma.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, this keeps getting better.” Wanda was practically beaming. “I would pay to witness this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic,” Agatha deadpanned. “Get your checkbook ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked, unbothered by Agatha’s hostility. “Oh, don’t worry, I don’t mind taking a front-row seat for free.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, but Wanda only grinned wider, happily tagging along as they made their way to the conference room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes later Agatha stood at the front of the conference room, arms crossed, her expression resting somewhere between unimpressed and homicidal. The group of residents before her looked like a bunch of scolded children.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha began, her tone as warm and inviting as a slab of ice. “I’ve been strongly encouraged, and by that, I mean blackmailed, into apologizing for the trauma I apparently inflicted upon you during the certification exercise.” She paused, letting her gaze sweep over them, her lips pressing into a thin, deeply unamused line. “So. Here it is. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. A few residents exchanged nervous glances. One actually gulped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled dramatically, as if this was the single most exhausting task she had undertaken in her entire career. “I’m sorry,” she continued, tone dripping with exaggerated patience, “that some of you have yet to experience water in your lives.  I’m sorry that standing in wet clothes for a few hours was apparently too much for you to bear. I’m sorry that, instead of rising to the challenge, some of you decided to… what was it? Oh, right. Catch pneumonia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tentative hand went up. “Uh, Dr. Harkness, are you saying you’re not actually—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, I am deeply sorry,” Agatha interrupted, placing a hand over her chest in mock sincerity. “I am devastated that your fragile constitutions couldn’t handle moisture. You poor, delicate creatures. How will you ever survive the horrors of, I don’t know, washing your hands?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone stifled a laugh. Others looked like they wanted to crawl under the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “Careful, Harkness,” Wanda whispered. “You wouldn’t want to emotionally damage them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her with the slow precision of someone considering murder. “Oh, you mean the way nature emotionally damaged them by daring to rain?” She looked back at the residents and sighed dramatically. “Fine. Let me be clear. I’m also sorry that I assumed you were all capable of enduring mild discomfort without falling apart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the residents, a young woman who looked like she had been through worse, spoke up. “So… what exactly are we supposed to take away from this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Take away that you might want to grow a spine before you’re alone in an OR at 3 a.m. with a patient coding and no one to hold your hand”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda finally pushed off the wall, stepping forward with the air of someone about to smooth things over. “What Dr. Harkness means…in her own… distinctive way is that we believe in you. We pushed you because we know you can handle it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few residents nodded, some looking chastened, others relieved. Agatha huffed. “Any questions?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” She turned on her heel. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have actual work to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she strode out, Wanda caught up with her in the hallway, smirking. “Well,” she said, voice full of amusement, “that was… inspiring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look. “Do not start.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda held up her hands in mock innocence. “Hey, I’m just saying, that was the most Agatha Harkness apology I’ve ever heard. Lilia is going to love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but somewhere deep, deep down, beneath all the irritation, there was a flicker of satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t backed down. She hadn’t caved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if the residents learned something? Well, that was their problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had barely made it down the hall when she heard quick footsteps behind her. She gritted her teeth, already </span>
<em>
<span>done with</span>
</em>
<span> this conversation before it even began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled through her nose. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned sharply, expecting some fragile little thing on the verge of tears, but instead, she found herself staring at </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The brunette from the trauma certification.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate… </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike the rest of her whining classmates, she hadn’t completely embarrassed herself that day. Agatha vaguely remembered her keeping up, at least better than the others. Which, granted, wasn’t a </span>
<em>
<span>high</span>
</em>
<span> bar, but it was enough to keep Agatha from immediately dismissing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate shifted under her gaze, clearly bracing herself for whatever </span>
<em>
<span>brutality</span>
</em>
<span> was about to come out of Agatha’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well?” Agatha crossed her arms. “Do you actually need something, or are you just here to waste my time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate swallowed, then straightened her shoulders like she was committing to this moment. “I want you to mentor me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “You what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mentor me,” Kate repeated, less hesitant now. “I want to be an OBGYN, and you’re the best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, unimpressed. “Flattery won’t get you anywhere with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate nodded. “I figured.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, and Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate nodded again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, considering her. She was young, obviously. Too green to fully understand what she was asking. But there was something there, a stubbornness, maybe even a little recklessness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha wasn’t exactly in the business of hand-holding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed, already regretting entertaining this conversation at all. “First of all, what’s your name?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate blinked. “Kate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…Bishop,” Kate added quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed. “Right. Bishop.” She let the name roll around in her head for a moment, then shrugged. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate frowned. “No?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha repeated. “Mentorship requires patience, which I don’t have. You want someone to hold your hand while you stumble through this program? Find someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate opened her mouth, but Agatha was already turning on her heel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not looking for someone to hold my hand,” Kate called after her. “I just need someone who’ll make me better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost kept walking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was over this conversation, over this day, over these sniveling little residents and their ridiculous requests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she said again, sharper this time, not even turning back. “You don’t get to waltz up to me, ask for my time, and expect me to care.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate didn’t move, didn’t flinch. “I don’t expect you to care. I expect you to teach.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That made Agatha pause. Just for a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled through her nose, eyes flicking up toward the ceiling as if it held the patience she clearly lacked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should say no.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She should tell this overconfident intern to get lost and go find someone with more compassion and less contempt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she thought about Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>About Lilia watching them both. Judging them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And what better way to get ahead than to do something Rio wouldn’t?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had no interest in mentorship, but she did have an interest in proving she was more than just a brilliant surgeon, she was an asset. And if taking on an eager little intern put her one step ahead of Rio in Lilia’s eyes?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well…. She could suffer through it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, fixing Kate with a stare. “Fine. You want me to mentor you? Congratulations, Bishop. You’re on my rotation starting now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate’s brows shot up, clearly surprised it had actually worked. “Wait seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t make me regret it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate straightened. “I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Because if you screw up, I will not be gentle about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate smirked. “I figured.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, already regretting this decision, and turned on her heel. “Hope you like hell, Bishop. Because you just signed up for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate didn’t argue, and that, at least, earned her a few points in Agatha’s book.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Kate stood there, looking all smug like she’d just won the lottery, Agatha’s gaze finally dropped to her scrubs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Purple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bright, obnoxious purple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately grimaced. Just like that, whatever microscopic sliver of respect she might have almost gained for this kid vanished into thin air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never mind,” she said flatly, waving a dismissive hand. “I take it back. You’re off my rotation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate blinked. “Wait—what? Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gestured vaguely at her like it should be </span>
<em>
<span>obvious</span>
</em>
<span>. “</span>
<em>
<span>That.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate glanced down at herself, frowning. “My scrubs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. Your hideous purple scrubs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate looked back up, thoroughly confused. “What’s wrong with purple?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Purple is my color.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate actually had the audacity to laugh. “Are you serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deadly.” Agatha crossed her arms. “You want to learn from me? First rule, burn those scrubs and never wear them again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate snorted. “So, just to be clear, my entire future as an OBGYN depends on not wearing purple?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “Now you’re getting it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate grinned. “Wow. I was expecting you to be tough, but this is a whole new level of insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, finally turning away. “You have no idea, Bishop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—--------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next few days went by as they always did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Daniel left for New York. Good riddance. Agatha didn’t have to think about her ex-husband again until Nicky’s next birthday, and that was a beautiful thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Nat left. </span>
<em>
<span>Less beautiful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t about to admit, to anyone, that it affected her. But it did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat had lingered in the doorway before leaving, squinting at Agatha like she knew something was off. “Promise me you’re not gonna go radio silent again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I work, Natasha. That’s not ‘radio silent.’ “</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat gave her an unimpressed look. “Yeah, well, I know you. You’ve pulled the ‘I’m too busy’ card before, and next thing I know, you’ve fallen off the face of the earth. So promise me you won’t be a complete hermit this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s called ‘being an adult with a job.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know what I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, she did. Nat had seen her disappear into herself before, weeks of dodging calls, texts, the whole hermit act. Agatha huffed, exasperated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Agatha sighed, pretending to be put out. “I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nat raised an eyebrow, still skeptical. “You better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Nat was gone, and Agatha was left to pretend like she didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had managed to keep herself occupied all week. Between torturing Kate in her work hours and spending time with Nat and Nicky in her off work hours, she hadn’t let herself think too much. There was no time to dwell. No time to let her mind wander to places it shouldn’t.But now, Saturday morning, Nat was gone as of a few hours ago, and Nicky was at Wanda’s house to spend some time with the twins for the entire weekend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And the thoughts Agatha had shoved into a dark corner of her mind all week? </span>
<em>
<span>They were back</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She refused to sit in them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed with an email. A last-minute request for a surgeon to pick up a 24-hour shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. Yes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Almost immediately after, she shot off a message to Kate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>If I’m doing a 24 hour shift on a weekend, you’re doing it with me. If you want to be taught, you have to suffer”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Kate’s response was almost instant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>This feels illegal, but okay”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt like the luckiest woman on the planet. She had successfully managed to avoid the thoughts that had been </span>
<span>threatening to</span>
<span> make her way back into her mind all week. And now she had gotten herself 24 hours free of her own thoughts, and to top it off, she was getting paid for the privilege. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha: 1, Universe: 0.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, as if the universe had been watching her with a wicked sense of humor, it decided to even the score.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze in the doorway of the trauma pit, her brain short-circuiting for a moment. </span>
<em>
<span>No. No, no, no, no, no.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>There, in the middle of the room, wearing scrubs that were way too tight to be legal, was the exact person Agatha had taken this shift to avoid in the first place. She had signed up for this shift in the hopes of burying her thoughts under a mountain of medical cases, only to have the universe deliver Rio Vidal in all her smug, scrubs wearing glory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes twitched. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course it’s her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The universe had just handed her a migraine on a silver platter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The universe was a cunt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed loudly, rubbing her temples. </span>
<em>
<span>“Agatha: 1, Universe: 1,” </span>
</em>
<span>she muttered to herself.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha had been so close to winning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had secured herself 24 hours of distraction; a whole shift of grueling surgeries, and mind numbing paperwork. She could almost taste the sweet relief of keeping herself busy, of avoiding everything. </span>
<em>
<span>She had been winning.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And then the universe, in its never ending spite, decided to humble her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was like some cosmic joke. Every single time Agatha thought she had the upper hand since moving to Minnesota, the universe would take one look at her efforts and say, “absolutely not, bitch”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should have known. She should have checked before signing up for this shift. But no, she had been so desperate for a distraction, so eager to shove her thoughts into the abyss, that she had walked right into the exact situation she was trying to avoid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was proof. Proof that God hated her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her palms began to sweat as she glanced around, her eyes landing on the one thing she was trying to escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t noticed her yet, which meant Agatha still had time to turn around and walk in the opposite direction. Maybe she could fake an emergency. Maybe she could—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, inhaling slowly through her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course. Of course she couldn’t.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She had no time for this. She had no time to deal with her emotions right now. Not with this shift, not with Rio, not with anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, her expression as unbothered as ever. “Morning, Harkness”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned just as Kate jogged up, holding out a cup of coffee like she was presenting some grand peace offering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brought you coffee,” Kate said proudly, clearly not understanding the severity of the situation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snatched it without comment, too busy mentally cursing the entire universe, and Kate. She could already feel the headache forming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had one plan. One. And now, not only was Rio here, but she was stuck with the intern too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God was testing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, as if this situation wasn’t already catastrophic, a voice drawled—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow and turned slowly to Rio, trying to maintain her composure. She wasn’t about to let Rio Vidal see how unhinged she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m on call. Same as you,” Agatha replied, her voice flat, like she was giving an explanation to a small child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I figured,” Rio answered. “Not you, Harkness; her.” She pointed at Kate, an amused glint in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate blinked, looking between them like she’d just walked into an alternate reality. “Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, the other eager little intern who’s about to get her soul crushed.” Rio’s lips twitched. “You’re not on call, Romel is”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate grinned. “I am now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, looking like she was trying to decide whether she was more impressed or amused. “You dragged an intern into a 24 hour shift with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, maintaining the last shred of composure she had left. “Call it a bonding exercise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate snorted, clearly relieved to have some humor in this otherwise chaotic situation. “Yeah, by ‘bonding exercise,’ she means ‘mild workplace hazing.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, unbothered. “Tomato, to-mah-to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. “Wait. Is she even getting paid for this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate blinked, processing the sudden revelation. “Wait. Am I getting paid for this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. She should have known she’d have to handle all the questions. “Do you want to be a great surgeon or not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate hesitated, clearly calculating the situation. “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then congratulations, you’re volunteering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate frowned. “That doesn’t sound legally sound.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha patted her shoulder like she was trying to soothe her, but it only added to the chaos. “Nothing about medicine is legally sound.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate scowled, arms crossed like a petulant child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even slow her stride. “Bishop, this is delegation. You’re learning an important skill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah? And what skill is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Knowing when to shut up and do as you’re told.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed. “Wow. Inspiring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, shoving the door open. “Glad to be a role model.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate stared at her with a look that bordered on desperation. Agatha gritted her teeth, downing the rest of her coffee in one long, furious gulp before tossing the empty cup into the nearest bin. “Come on, Bishop. I don’t have time for whatever nonsense this is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate quickly followed her down the hallway, but not before throwing Rio one last glance. It was the kind of look that said everything without saying a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha couldn’t help but feel a flicker of jealousy. Because it wasn’t just Kate who was stuck here, looking completely out of her element. It was her, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind was still reeling from the last few minutes. She was on the edge of losing it, and the last thing she wanted was Rio's teasing presence making it all worse. But there she was. As if fate wasn’t trying hard enough to test her. She should have known better than to think she could outrun her feelings, especially not when she was stuck here, right in the middle of the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate groaned behind her, but Agatha didn’t bother looking back. She had bigger things to focus on, things that didn’t involve babysitting an intern with shaky hands and a questionable sense of confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second she stepped into the hallway, the chaos of the hospital swallowed her whole. Nurses rushed past, monitors beeped in the distance, and the scent of antiseptic clung to the air. It was a familiar kind of madness, the kind that kept her moving, kept her from thinking too hard about anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked it that way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—----------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first few hours of her shift, Agatha successfully avoided any interaction with Rio. She didn’t look at her, didn’t acknowledge her, didn’t even breathe in her direction. As far as she was concerned, Rio Vidal did not exist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, her presence did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t matter which part of the hospital Agatha found herself in; she always knew when Rio was nearby. A shift in the air, the faintest sound of footsteps, and just like that, Rio’s energy would slam into her like an unavoidable force. It was annoying, like a song stuck in her head, except instead of music, it was just awareness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was not in the mood for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was exactly why she had trapped herself in an empty room with Kate, teaching her how to suture. Because if there was anything more miserable than being in Rio’s presence, it was teaching a baby doctor how to stitch a tear without making it look like Frankenstein’s monster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate, to her credit, was taking this very seriously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, to her credit, was not yet homicidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a win for both of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Bishop,” Agatha sighed, crossing her arms as she watched Kate fumble with the needle. “Let’s pretend for a second that I don’t hate you. How are you going to impress me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate furrowed her brow in concentration, clearly trying to focus despite the stress. “By doing a perfect subcuticular suture?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her an unimpressed look. “If you were going to do it perfectly, you wouldn’t still be standing there looking like an anxious intern about to fuck it up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate scowled but said nothing. Probably because she was, indeed, an anxious intern about to fuck it up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go on,” Agatha gestured toward the practice pad, “show me your perfect suture.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate took a slow breath, clearly hyping herself up. Then, with the utmost focus, she began, her hands trembling ever so slightly as she worked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched silently for all of three seconds before sighing deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bishop,” she said flatly, “what the fuck are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate frowned. “Suturing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not suturing, that’s embroidery.” Agatha leaned in, examining Kate’s work like it personally offended her. “Christ. If I wanted decorative stitching, I’d ask Martha Stewart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate groaned. “It’s not that bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look so sharp it could slice through steel. “It’s worse than bad. It’s an atrocity. An insult to anyone who’s ever had to wear a suture.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, fine,” Kate muttered. “It’s bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snatched the needle from her hand, barely able to hide her frustration. “Here, watch and actually learn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate watched as Agatha threaded the needle with ease, her hands moving with practiced fluidity, too fast for Kate’s sleep-deprived brain to follow. There was something almost hypnotic about the way Agatha worked. Efficient, precise, controlled. It was a stark contrast to the chaos of her own thoughts, something Kate envied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This,” Agatha muttered as she worked, “is how you don’t make a mess out of someone’s vagina.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate choked, her face flushing crimson. “Please, please never say that sentence again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Why? Feeling squeamish, Bishop?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” Kate scowled. “Just… weirdly personal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finished her stitch with a flourish, stepping back to admire her work. It was almost perfect, far better than what Kate had managed, and that was all that mattered right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, if you don’t want to personally destroy someone’s perineum, maybe you should practice until you don’t suck at this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate grumbled something under her breath but grabbed the needle back, her determination now clear. She was serious about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, watching her carefully. It was easier to focus on this. On the work. On teaching. On anything other than the fact that no matter how hard she tried, she still felt Rio’s presence in every damn corner of this hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every time the door creaked open, every time footsteps echoed down the hallway, Agatha's attention would shift for just a moment, her brain tuning into Rio like a radio searching for a signal. She couldn’t avoid it. Even when she didn’t want to think about it, especially when she didn’t want to think about it, there she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head buzzed, her frustration growing as her thoughts tangled. She had come here to get away. To </span>
<em>
<span>escape</span>
</em>
<span>. But it felt like no matter how hard she tried, the gravitational pull of Rio Vidal was always just a little bit too strong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The minutes went by, and there were no signs of Rio. She had just started to consider that maybe, </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span>, this shift wouldn’t be a complete disaster when her pager went off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes snapped to it, grateful for the distraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ripped the pager from her belt, her heart rate speeding up as she scanned the message.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Emergency delivery. Ten minutes out. OR 3</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, already tossing her gloves into the bin. “Alright, Bishop, you’re done playing with the practice pad. I’ve got a real patient coming in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate perked up. “Great, I’ll—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you’ll go do my paperwork.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate’s face fell as she stared at her in disbelief. “Wait, what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was already halfway to the door, her movements sharp and efficient. “You heard me. I need the charts from the last three patients logged. And if you do it correctly, I might let you scrub in next time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate groaned dramatically but didn’t argue. Agatha wasn’t in the mood for her whining, especially not when a real emergency was looming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned the corner into the trauma bay just as the doors burst open. The team of paramedics wheeled in a woman mid-contraction, breathless, her face twisted in pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thirty two years old, thirty six weeks, severe preeclampsia,” one of them called. “BP’s through the roof, seizures in the ambulance, she needs an emergency section.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded sharply. “Get her to OB now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind clicked into place, every second moving like clockwork. “Get her to OB now,” she barked. The team moved with practiced precision, and just as Agatha was about to follow, she caught a glimpse of something, or rather, someone, out of the corner of her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And her stomach flipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because standing across from her, already gloving up, was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair was tucked under a scrub cap, the mask dangling loosely around her neck, eyes sharp and focused as she prepared for the surgery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her jaw clench. Of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She braced herself for some kind of smug comment, a teasing remark, a knowing smirk, anything that would set her on edge, the kind of games Rio always liked to play. But instead, Rio just met her gaze with an even, composed look and nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll assist you. Romel is stitching up some idiots who fell off their bikes,” Rio said, her tone calm, polite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No smirk. No teasing. No games.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just calm, polite professionalism.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know what to do with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brow furrowed as she processed that. She couldn’t quite figure out what to make of it, and the fact that she </span>
<em>
<span>couldn’t</span>
</em>
<span> figure it out unsettled her. She stared at Rio for a beat too long before blinking and turning sharply on her heel. “Fine,” she muttered, willing her heart rate to steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved quickly. The patient was prepped for surgery, the anesthesiologist worked with precision, and soon enough, Agatha was making the first incision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, it didn’t even occur to her that Rio was standing next to her. They had scrubbed in together before, of course, but it had always been a chaotic rush, each of them maneuvering around the other, quick, effective, occasionally brushing against each other. But this time? This time, Rio wasn’t flirting. She wasn’t watching Agatha like she was some puzzle to be solved. She wasn’t even throwing her usual teasing remarks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was just… there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Assisting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Efficient. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Methodical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Professional. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It shouldn’t have felt wrong, but it did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t shake the disorientation it caused. Every now and then, her gaze flickered up from the patient, expecting some sort of look, some small acknowledgment from Rio, something, anything. But every time, she found nothing but quiet concentration in Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands moved with practiced grace, never wavering, and Agatha, well, Agatha wasn’t used to this. She wasn’t used to feeling like she didn’t have Rio’s full attention. Her chest tightened, her mind spiraling in confusion as she focused on closing up, the skillful suturing of the incision almost mechanical in its simplicity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she was closing up, she was scowling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The baby was fine. The mother was stable. The procedure had gone as smoothly as an emergency C-section could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything was fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why did she feel so off?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head buzzed with an uncomfortable tension. She finished the suturing, stripped off her gloves, and turned, fully expecting Rio to say something. A compliment. A sarcastic remark. Anything. But no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just gave a short nod. “Good work, Dr. Harkness,” she said in that calm, neutral voice, her eyes briefly meeting Agatha’s before she turned and left the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No smirk. No taunt. No lingering gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just… left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared after her for a moment, blinking in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she missed something?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded in her chest, and a strange mix of anger and frustration surged up. It was almost like Rio didn’t even care anymore. And that pissed her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stormed out of the OR, her mind racing, frustration churning in her gut. The sharp, echoing clack of her shoes against the sterile hospital floors only heightened the feeling of betrayal, as though the very ground was betraying her. The whole situation felt like an affront.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d been so close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d been managing to ignore it all, the tension, the mess they’d made of their relationship, the way Rio seemed to shift from flirtation to indifference in the span of a single day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, after everything, she had to watch as Rio Vidal, the woman who had driven her crazy for weeks, had walked out of that room without so much as a sideways glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should have been able to keep it together. She should have been able to stay focused on her work and nothing else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But of course, not everything went her way. Because no matter how hard she tried to ignore Rio Vidal, the damn woman always seemed to find a way to worm her way back into Agatha’s thoughts, making it impossible to just move on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why the hell is she doing this to me?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest constricted. Her blood boiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stormed down the hall, trying desperately to put as much distance between herself and the OR as possible. The feeling of helplessness clawed at her chest like a beast that wouldn’t let go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she walked through the sterile, empty corridors of the hospital, all she could hear was the echo of her own frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had spent the last few weeks of her life learning exactly how to brace herself for Rio Vidal. Agatha had spent countless hours observing her, watching the way Rio operated with that easy charm, how she pushed boundaries, teased, and smiled like she knew things she had no business knowing. Agatha had grown used to that, the way Rio made her feel like she was being drawn into something she didn’t understand, something dangerous, something thrilling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now? This past week, Rio had switched gears completely. Polite nods, professional distance. The kind of behavior that made Agatha feel like she was standing in the middle of a well rehearsed performance, and she had no idea what the script was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With an irritated yank, Agatha pulled off her mask as she walked through the hospital’s sterile hallways, barely noticing where she was going. Her mind was still reeling from the encounter in the OR, from Rio’s complete lack of </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached the nurses’ station, still scowling, hands shoved deep into her pockets like they could anchor her to reality. Kate was hunched over a pile of paperwork, looking every bit like she had been forced to transcribe the entire hospital’s medical history by hand. The sight would have been comical if Agatha wasn’t so pissed off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate looked up at her approach, expression immediately wary. “Uh-oh. Who pissed you off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored the question entirely, dropping into the chair across from her with an exaggerated huff, slumping as though the weight of the entire hospital rested on her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate raised an eyebrow, a slight smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Bad surgery?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha snapped, her voice tight. She let out a frustrated sigh, then muttered, “It was fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate frowned. “Then why do you look like someone ran over your cat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her, fighting the urge to bite back a snarky response. “I don’t have a cat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate shrugged. “Okay, well, if you did, you look like someone ran it over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of her nose. She wasn’t about to sit here and dissect whatever the hell had just happened with Rio. Especially not with Kate Bishop of all people, who had a habit of poking at things she shouldn’t, asking questions Agatha didn’t have answers to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate, who was still staring at her like she could read her mind, and Agatha wasn’t sure if she found that more irritating or terrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rolling her eyes, Agatha finally snapped. “Shouldn’t you be working? You know, doing the paperwork I told you to do? You’re supposed to be making my life easier, Bishop, and so far, you’re doing an awful job of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was working,” Kate said defensively, motioning to the half filled charts in front of her. “Then you showed up looking like you just lost a fight with God.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t dignify that with a response. Instead, she reached for her coffee only to find it empty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She frowned. “Where’s my refill?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate blinked, clearly confused. “I—what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My coffee, Bishop.” Agatha waved dramatically the empty cup, giving Kate a pointed look. “Do I look caffeinated to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate stared at her, then shook her head in disbelief. “You made me work this shift for free, and now you expect me to fetch your coffee?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate opened her mouth. Closed it. Pinched the bridge of her nose exactly like Agatha had just done moments ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she let out a long, slow sigh and stood. “You know what? Fine. But only because I want coffee too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Whatever helps you sleep at night, Bishop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate muttered something under her breath as she walked away, and Agatha leaned back in her chair with a deep, tired breath. She was fine. Everything was fine. She didn’t need to worry about the fact that Rio had been so normal today, so detached, like their entire past was just something she could easily sweep under the rug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, she wasn’t going to think about it. She couldn’t. She had work to do. She was fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So fine that she had been sitting at the nurses' station for a full five minutes, staring blankly at a patient chart, without reading a single word. She was so damn tired of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because her mind, the traitorous, idiotic thing that it was, wasn’t on the chart. Or the shift. Or the poor, overworked intern she was exploiting for free labor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind? Her mind was on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio had been normal. Too normal. And it was making Agatha feel like she had accidentally stepped into some alternate dimension where everything made sense, and she hated it. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything had changed after the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss she had initiated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, she had run away from it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Rio was acting like none of it had happened. Like Agatha hadn’t grabbed her by the collar and kissed her like she was trying to solve every problem in her life with one reckless, desperate move. Like Rio hadn’t kissed her back, and Agatha hadn’t felt something when their lips had met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t want things to go back to normal. No. That was a lie. She didn’t want this new normal. This weird, distant, unbothered Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know what she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was exactly the problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sharp breath, Agatha shook her head, trying to push it all aside. Focus. Work. She had work to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—because the universe was a vindictive bitch—Rio walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened before she could stop herself, her heart kicking into overdrive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t seem to notice. Or if she did, she didn’t show it. She just walked up to the counter, grabbed a patient file, and flipped it open as if she weren’t currently ruining Agatha’s entire existence with her presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even look at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was about to ignore her completely, pretend she wasn’t there, pretend she didn’t care, when Rio, without looking up from the file, spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been sitting there for five minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned a page, her voice casual. “Five minutes. Staring at that chart. Haven’t flipped it once.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled, irritation rising again. “Maybe I was thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, the sound almost too casual. “Sure. Let’s go with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled. “I was thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio looked up at her, and for the first time since their last encounter, really looked at her. Not in that teasing, amused way she was used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It made Agatha feel like her skin didn’t fit right. Her heart stuttered in her chest, and her hands twitched with the urge to do something, anything, to break the tension that was suddenly unbearable between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was about to snap, about to say something, anything, when Kate reappeared, dropping a fresh coffee cup in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here,” Kate announced, before plopping down in her chair. “Not that you deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed the cup without hesitation, taking a long sip, as though the hot liquid might burn away the unease crawling under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her, her eyes flicking between Agatha and Kate, then asked, “You really have her running errands for you?” Her tone was amused, but it didn’t mask the curiosity lurking beneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate scoffed. “Right? That’s what I said.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, unfazed, leaned back in her chair with a smirk. “She’s learning valuable skills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kate snorted. “Yeah, like how to be exploited.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head with a small, almost rueful smirk, then turned back to her file.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha should’ve felt victorious. But instead, everything just felt… </span>
<em>
<span>off</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And with a muttered curse that was definitely not hospital-appropriate, Agatha slouched deeper into her chair, wishing she could escape whatever mess her emotions had gotten tangled up in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—-----------</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next few hours were hell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kind of hell that made Agatha question all her life choices that led her here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every surgical procedure bled into the next, an unending cycle of high-stakes decisions, steady hands, and relentless pressure. There were no breaks, no time to breathe, no pause to process. Every second felt like it was biting into her bones, and the exhaustion was suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, of course, Rio was there for all of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like they spoke much.There was barely time to. But she </span>
<em>
<span>felt</span>
</em>
<span> her. Everywhere. They moved like two parts of the same machine, cutting, suturing, making life or death decisions without hesitation. Together, they flowed through the surgeries, two professionals working in perfect sync, no hesitation, no second guessing. A beautiful, maddening choreography.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It should have been good. It should have been the ideal working relationship. The kind of bond that every surgeon dreamed of. But it wasn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, it was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because no matter how hard she tried to focus, no matter how much she told herself she did not care, Agatha couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling crawling up her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way her mind kept circling back to Rio, like an itch she couldn’t scratch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like a problem she couldn’t solve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the chaos finally settled, it was well past 2 a.m. and Agatha felt like she had been wrung out. Every muscle in her body ached with exhaustion, her scrubs stiff and sticky with god knows what from the countless surgeries she had performed. Her mind was a haze of fatigue, and her patience, what little she had left, was nonexistent. The caffeine had long worn off, and now she was left with nothing but the sickly remnants of a crash that made her feel like she was teetering on the edge of collapse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio. God, Rio’s presence was still gnawing at her. The quiet professionalism was grating. It was so calm, so controlled, and yet Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Something had changed. It was like she was still stuck in the aftermath of the kiss, of what had been, what could have been. And now Rio had retreated, back into the safe distance of a coworker, a colleague. She was polite, efficient, and utterly unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t sure if she wanted to throttle Rio or throw herself into the ocean and hope to drown in the sound of the waves. Everything felt so... confusing. It made her angry that she couldn’t get a grip on any of it. Between the exhaustion, the caffeine crash, and Rio’s infuriating presence, she was pretty sure this was how she was going to die. Collapsed in a heap on the pit floor, with Rio standing over her, probably smirking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, with a sharp exhale, she did what any sane person would do at this hour: she escaped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way to the on-call room, dragging her exhausted body like a corpse that was still somehow walking. Every step was a struggle. She got to her room and the realization hit. She hadn't stopped anywhere  to grab something, anything to eat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that’s when she saw it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting neatly on the table, as though placed there by some divine hand, was a Greek salad and an iced tea. </span>
<em>
<span>Her favorite.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, standing frozen in the doorway, the exhaustion momentarily forgotten. She stared at the food for a beat too long, skeptical. Who would have known that she liked this? She hadn’t even told Kate that she ate it on every shift, or everyday she was at the hospital. The thought made her stomach flip uncomfortably, and she couldn’t shake the suspicion that something wasn’t right. The feeling deepened when she grabbed her phone and shot a quick text to Kate.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Thanks for the food.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A beat passed before Kate responded, and Agatha waited with bated breath.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Didn’t realize you were observant enough to notice that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Kate had won herself some points with the food. Agatha had always eaten the same thing when she worked at the hospital, a Greek salad, iced tea, no exceptions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A minute passed. Then—</span>
</p><p><b>Kate:</b> <em><span>What food?</span></em></p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, a wave of confusion sweeping over her. She glanced down at the screen again, rereading Kate’s message, feeling something stirring in the pit of her stomach.</span>
</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <em><span>The Greek salad. And the iced tea.</span></em></p><p><b>Kate:</b> <em><span>Dr. Harkness, I have no idea what you’re talking about.</span></em></p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her screen, eyes narrowing. What the hell? She quickly scrolled back through their messages. No mention of food. No hint that Kate had done anything, let alone brought her dinner. Agatha sat there for a moment, the quiet hum of the hospital around her, trying to process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, like a punch to the gut, it hit her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart dropped into her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t Kate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It couldn’t have been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes snapped up, scanning the empty room around her with frantic urgency. The silence felt oppressive now. Every corner of the room, every shadow felt charged. She turned slowly, as if the food might suddenly vanish, or the world might stop making sense altogether.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had already known, hadn’t she? The moment her gaze had flicked to the table, she had already known. She had felt it, a strange sensation, like someone had been watching, waiting for her to realize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was on her feet before she even realized what she was doing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Greek salad, the betrayal salad, sat abandoned on the table as she stormed out of her room, her blood boiling hotter with every step.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was bullshit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was textbook Rio Vidal bullshit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was not going to stand for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her footsteps echoed furiously through the halls as she made her way straight to Rio’s room. She didn’t hesitate. Didn’t second guess herself. She just knocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, pounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like a maniac.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knocked again, harder this time. Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, hell no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another thought, she shoved the door open, ready to unleash hell- </span>
</p><p>
<span>Only to find the room empty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bed was undone, the sheets a tangled mess, but Rio was nowhere to be seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s irritation flared into something even </span>
<em>
<span>uglier</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had stormed over here, on a mission, only for Rio to be—what? Gone? Missing? Evaporated into thin air like the smug, infuriating bitch she was?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unacceptable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spun on her heel, marching straight to the pit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made her way to the ORs, her exhaustion now replaced with sheer, unfiltered rage.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Still no Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped in the middle of the hallway, taking a </span>
<em>
<span>deep</span>
</em>
<span> breath through her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>If murder were legal…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She yanked out her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Where the hell are you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It took all of </span>
<em>
<span>five seconds</span>
</em>
<span> before a response came in.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Is there an emergency coming up? Romel and Kate are covering the pit. They are supposed to page us if anything comes in. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw red.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> No emergency</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Answer the fucking question.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> 18th floor.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The 18th floor?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the fuck was on the 18th floor?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip tightened on her phone. She didn’t know what the hell Rio was playing at. But she was going to find out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if she had to kill her in the process?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was just a bonus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped onto the 18th floor, her irritation spiking the second the elevator doors slid open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was deserted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The halls were eerily empty, the lights dimmed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled sharply, running a hand down her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of fucking course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should’ve known Rio was messing with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yanking out her phone, she fired off a text.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> I swear to God, Vidal, if this is another one of your games…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone vibrated almost instantly.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Did you get to the 18th floor?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Yes.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio:</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Good. Now find the emergency stairs and go up.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the screen, jaw tightening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the fuck was this? Some mystical scavenger hunt?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She inhaled sharply, debating whether to ignore her completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But against her better judgment, and because she needed to yell at Rio in person, she set off down the hall, searching for the stairwell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She found it tucked away in the farthest corner of the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fucking inconvenient, just like everything about Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she pushed through the door and started climbing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One flight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two flights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hit a locked door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at it, chest rising and falling with irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You have got to be kidding me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers curled into fists as she reached for her phone again.</span>
</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> <em><span>The door is locked.</span></em></p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clenched her jaw. Her patience was all but gone. She had been baited this far, there was no turning back now. If Rio thought she was going to back off, she was about to be very disappointed. She didn’t give a damn about the locked door. She’d find a way in, even if it meant breaking it down herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched on for what felt like an eternity, and just as Agatha’s fury reached its peak, the lock clicked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door swung open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her dark hair was down, whipping wildly in the wind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's breath caught in her throat, and for a second, she forgot how to be angry. Rio stood before her, framed by the dim light of the rooftop behind her, the wind tugging at her dark hair, making it swirl around her face. She was the picture of casual grace, perfectly poised, as though she hadn’t just sent Agatha on some absurd scavenger hunt across the damn hospital. Her eyes glinted with something unreadable, her lips curled into that infuriating half smirk that made Agatha want to scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here I am,” Rio said, her voice as calm as ever, as if Agatha hadn’t just climbed three flights of stairs in a fit of rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She stepped forward, pushing the door open wider with a shove, her gaze never leaving Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What the hell is this, Vidal?" Agatha snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. "A game? A riddle? Because I’m getting sick of your stupid mind games." Her chest heaved with frustration, but she couldn’t quite shake the feeling that this wasn’t just a game. Not anymore. "What the hell do you want from me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer immediately. She simply stepped back, holding the door open for Agatha to enter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the doorframe, one brow quirked. “Are you coming out, or are you just gonna stand there looking pissed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squinted at her, then at the rooftop beyond. “That depends. Are you planning to murder me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Not tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, well, that’s reassuring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, stepping back to give her space. “Harkness, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn’t go through the effort of luring you to the roof. I’d just sabotage your caffeine supply and let nature take its course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled. “That’s sick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s efficient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, still suspicious, but curiosity won out. She stepped forward, crossing the threshold onto the rooftop. The wind hit her immediately, cool and crisp against her skin, whipping at her coat. She pulled it tighter around herself. “So?” she demanded. “What the hell are you doing up here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer right away. She just turned on her heel, starting across the roof like she expected Agatha to follow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the worst part?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She blamed exhaustion. And also rage. Because she still hadn’t yelled at Rio about the whole food situation, and she wasn’t about to let that slide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she stomped after her, boots clicking against the concrete. “Vidal, if this is some elaborate ploy to shove me off the building, I will haunt you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just chuckled, leading her to a quiet spot near the edge of the rooftop where a single bench sat. It was a perfect vantage point, overlooking the whole damn city.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped in her tracks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the view was—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It was breathtaking.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Mayo Clinic loomed in the foreground, a testament to all the chaos inside. But beyond that? The city of Rochester stretched out beneath them, scattered with streetlights and glowing windows, everything twinkling under the dark Minnesota sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was quiet. Still. Almost peaceful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha hated that it stunned her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That she actually had to take a second to breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally turned, squinting at Rio like she was seeing her for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this?” she asked, voice still edged with suspicion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the railing, glancing out at the city. “Second helicopter arrival zone,” she said simply. “But it’s never used.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked at her confusion. “Found it my first year here,” she continued, gesturing around them. “Technically, it’s a backup landing site, but no one ever comes up here. Too much wind, not enough traffic to justify it. So, it just… sits here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms. “And what, you just claimed it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I needed somewhere to escape. When things get too stressful, I come up here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha eyed her, suddenly seeing her in a different light. This was where she went when things got overwhelming? This was how she handled it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her own anger, hot and consuming just minutes ago, fizzled into something more complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked away, back at the city, her arms still crossed like a shield.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The salad,” Agatha said abruptly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head slightly, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t pretend not to know what she meant. She just exhaled through her nose, tilting her head back to look at the sky. “You looked stressed,” she said simply. “Figured you needed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just watched her, that unreadable expression still plastered on her face. Her eyes glinted in the moonlight, and Agatha couldn’t tell whether she was amused or waiting for Agatha to have some kind of breakdown. Either way, she felt herself growing more frustrated by the second. She couldn’t even get a solid read on Rio anymore. One moment, she was playing mind games, making Agatha climb three flights of stairs and nearly lose her damn mind, and the next, she was pulling some tender, thoughtful gesture out of nowhere with that damn Greek salad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>No teasing, no ulterior motive?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just… a quiet acknowledgment? A small act of care?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach twisted uncomfortably.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t like not knowing how to respond to Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “You figured I needed it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her, clearly not expecting that reaction. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t know whether to strangle you or thank you," Agatha muttered, narrowing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don’t have to thank me," Rio said, her voice softer than usual. It was almost as if Rio was trying to be serious for once, and it unsettled Agatha. "You looked like you were going to snap. Honestly, I was just trying to make sure you didn’t." Rio's words were calm, measured, almost too calm for a conversation that had started with a lot of sarcasm and irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that Agatha didn’t believe her. No, that was the problem, she did. She believed it in a way that made her stomach twist, in a way that made her pulse stutter against her ribs. Because it was so simple. So casual. Like it hadn’t meant anything at all. Like it hadn’t thrown her completely off her axis.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath, her arms still crossed tightly over her chest, her fingers gripping the sleeves of her coat as if anchoring herself. Her thoughts churned, chaotic and restless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a dry, humorless laugh, running a hand through her hair. “Right. Sure. Because you’re so thoughtful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “What is your problem?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My problem—” Agatha snapped, turning to face her fully now, hands on her hips, “—is that you don’t get to play this fucking game with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, visibly confused. “What game?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, looking away for a moment like she needed to physically collect herself before she lost her mind. “You,” she said, voice sharp. “You’ve been acting weird ever since last Friday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows furrowed. “What the hell are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a bitter laugh. “Oh, don’t play dumb.” She pointed at Rio accusingly. “You barely talked to me all shift, didn’t look at me, nothing. And now, suddenly, you’re nice?” She threw her arms out. “Buying me food? Dragging me up to your secret rooftop getaway?” She scoffed. “What, am I supposed to just pretend that’s normal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face twisted with genuine confusion. “I am being normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gaped at her. “No, you’re not!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I am!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you’re not!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a frustrated breath. “I don’t know what you want from me, Harkness. I’m being polite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look of utter disbelief. “Polite?” she repeated, voice sharp with incredulity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck off,” Agatha snapped. “You’re never polite. That’s not you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “So, let me get this straight. You’re mad at me because I’m being too nice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio made a baffled sound. “What the fuck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her hands up. “You changed!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose, suddenly feeling too warm, too on edge. “You changed after last Friday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something flickered across Rio’s face, but she schooled it quickly. “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw. “You know exactly what it means.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “No, I really don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at her. “The kiss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression didn’t shift. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And—” Agatha gestured wildly. “You’ve been acting weird ever since!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply, rubbing her temple like she was trying to fend off a headache. “I have no idea what you want from me, Agatha. I’m just being normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “This isn’t normal for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed her arms, tilting her head. “What exactly is normal for me, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw locked. She knew the answer. Knew exactly what she had come to expect from Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But this?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This wasn’t it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sharp breath, shaking her head. “This is unbelievable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms tightly over her chest. “Oh, I’m unbelievable?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Rio threw up her hands. “You kissed me, Agatha! You. And then you ran away like your life fucking depended on it. What the hell was I supposed to do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, but she scowled. “You could’ve called!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “Oh, sure. That would’ve gone great. ‘Hey, Agatha, just checking in after you sprinted out of the club like you were being chased by the fucking FBI. You good?’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw. “Don’t mock me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Rio said, voice firm. “I just— You ran. That wasn’t some accident. That was you deciding you didn’t want to deal with whatever the hell that kiss meant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse was pounding in her ears. “That’s not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s exactly what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat felt tight. She turned away, suddenly unable to hold Rio’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the worst part?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The worst part was that Rio was right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had kissed Rio, had let herself fall into it, had felt the heat, the pull, the electricity, and then, the second it was over, the weight of it had crashed down on her like a tsunami.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just a kiss. It was a decision. A crack in the wall she had spent her entire life building.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she panicked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because this wasn’t just about Rio. This was about everything. About what it meant. About what it said about her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had spent her entire life pushing these thoughts down, burying them, pretending they didn’t exist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tried to be normal. Tried to do things the way she was supposed to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had married Daniel. Had built a whole life around the idea of what she should want, of who she should be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then it had all crumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now here she was, standing on a rooftop at 3 a.m., fighting with Rio Vidal about a kiss she didn’t even know how to define.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, forcing herself to look back at Rio. “You should’ve followed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes darkened at Agatha's words, her posture tightening. She took a step forward, the air between them crackling with unspoken tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You think I should've just run after you, Agatha? After you bolted like that?" Rio's voice was low, edged with a mix of frustration and hurt that Agatha hadn't expected. "After you kissed me and disappeared? You think that’s what I should’ve done?  So you could push me away?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flashed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because, deep down, she knew the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s exactly what she would have done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “You want to be mad at me? Fine. But don’t act like I’m the one playing games here. I’ve been flirting with you since the day we met, and you know it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched. She did know it. Rio told her that, before Agatha kissed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You act like I’ve changed,” Rio continued, voice lower now. “Like I’m doing something different. But the only thing that’s different is you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach churned. “That’s not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, it is.” Rio took a step closer. “So tell me, Agatha. What do you actually want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth went dry. She couldn’t answer. Couldn’t force the words out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she didn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or maybe she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she had always known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But saying it out loud? That was something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands curled into fists at her sides. “You know what, Vidal? Maybe you’re right. I did run” She let out a humorless laugh. “But that doesn’t mean you had to go and—and—” She gestured wildly at Rio, her words tangling with frustration. “Fucking pretend like nothing happened after you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice cut off sharply, her throat tightening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just stared at her, expression unreadable. “After I what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw so hard it ached. “After you fucking marked me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something flickered across Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, her rage barely contained. “You left a hickey on me. And then what? You just—what? Decided it didn’t mean anything? You went completely silent, didn’t text, didn’t say shit—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows pulled together. “You ran.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flinched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was calm, but there was something razor-sharp under it. “You kissed me. You bit me.” A humorless smirk tugged at her lips. “And then you bolted like your life depended on it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “So yeah, I didn’t text you. Because I figured that’s what you wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a scoff, but it was weak. “That’s bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step closer, her voice steady. “Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated the way she swallowed hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hated the way her pulse jumped in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the truth was, she had run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe, maybe a part of her had wanted Rio to chase her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To prove her wrong. To prove that whatever was happening between them wasn’t just something fleeting, something Agatha had imagined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio hadn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that meant—</span>
</p><p>
<span>No.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath. “Jesus, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t Jesus, Agatha me!” Her voice was rising now, the heat of it finally reaching a breaking point. “You want to act like you’ve been all innocent in this? Like you’re some victim of my supposed mixed signals? Bullshit. You’ve been fucking with me since the moment we met.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tightened. “I was flirting with you, yeah. But after last Friday? I figured that was your answer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, her anger crashing against something raw and uncomfortable. “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means,” Rio said, voice quieter now, “that I stopped.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, her chest tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “I wasn’t playing some game, Agatha. I wasn’t trying to punish you or make some stupid point.” She exhaled. “I thought you weren’t interested. So I backed off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth. Then closed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, low, exasperated. “ I gave you space. I backed off. And now you’re mad at me for it?” She shook her head, something bitter in her tone. “I don’t know what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath came sharp and uneven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the truth was, she didn’t fucking know either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her feelings were a mess, a tangled, chaotic, impossible mess.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she had wanted Rio to follow her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she had also wanted to run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had wanted Rio to tease her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she had also wanted to ignore it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had wanted—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even know what she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe that was the whole problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed, gripping the edge of her coat. “You didn’t have to—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Didn’t have to what? Respect your very obvious rejection?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach churned. “That’s not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it then?” Rio cut in, shaking her head. “Because from where I’m standing, this whole thing only seems to be a problem when I stop pushing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest went tight. But before she could find the words, before she could fix whatever this was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rios phone sounded, notifications coming in. She let out a slow breath, her gaze heavy. “I need to sleep. We have an ambulance arriving in an hour. I suggest you do the same” she paused “goodnight Agatha”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaving Agatha standing there, alone, with nothing but the wind howling around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood frozen, her body locked in place as Rio's retreating figure grew smaller and smaller with each step. Her chest felt like it had collapsed in on itself, every breath coming harder than the last. She wanted to shout. Wanted to call after her. But the words wouldn’t come. The weight of them pressed down, crushing her.</span>
</p><p>

<span>Damn it.</span>

<p>Her hands clenched at her sides, nails digging into her palms as the cold wind bit at her skin. She didn’t know what to do. Didn’t know what to feel. Her anger, her frustration, felt like it was bubbling over, but underneath it, something else stirred. Something deeper. And just as terrifying.</p><p>Rio had left.</p><p>And now, all that remained was this deafening silence.</p><p>She should have said something. <em> Anything. </em> She should have—</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>She should have known better. Should have kept her distance. Should have never let herself get so tangled up in whatever the hell was happening between them.</p><p>But in that moment, when Rio had leaned in, when she kissed her, Agatha had felt it. That desperate, aching need for something real. Something that wasn’t just another part of her carefully constructed façade.</p><p>She was so fucking tired of pretending.</p><p>The kiss had left her shaken, raw. She didn’t know how to explain it, couldn’t even begin to articulate the mess of emotions swirling inside her. But then she had run. </p><p>She turned and walked to the edge of the rooftop, her boots clattering on the concrete as she gazed out at the city below. The lights from the buildings seemed to blur together, a sea of colors swirling in the darkness. It looked so peaceful from up here. So distant. Almost like it wasn’t even real.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand over her face. She needed to think. Needed to get her head on straight.</p><p>But the more she thought about it, the more she realized she didn’t have the answers. She didn’t know what she wanted. Didn’t know what she was even supposed to do.</p><p>She just knew she couldn’t keep running. Couldn’t keep pushing people away, pretending that she could do everything on her own.</p><p>The wind picked up again, the cool air whipping around her, and for a moment, Agatha let herself close her eyes, trying to center herself.</p><p>But it didn’t help.</p><p>Nothing helped.</p><p>Agatha trudged back inside, her mind still racing with the weight of Rio’s words.</p><p>
<em> "This whole thing only seems to be a problem when I stop pushing." </em>
</p><p>She exhaled sharply, pushing a hand through her hair. She needed to sleep. Or at least <em> try </em> to.</p><p>The on-call room was empty when she slipped inside, the air stale and heavy with exhaustion. She shrugged off her jacket, dropping onto the thin mattress with a groan. The room was quiet, too quiet. Her body ached, her limbs screamed for rest, but her mind? <em> Fucking relentless. </em></p><p>She lay on her back, staring at the ceiling, every word Rio had said replaying in her head like a broken record.</p><p>
<em> "I thought you weren’t interested. So I backed off." </em>
</p><p>She clenched her jaw, flipping onto her side. Then her stomach. Then her back again.</p><p>Minutes passed. Then an hour.</p><p>Sleep didn’t come.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself to just <em> shut the fuck up and rest, </em> but her body refused. Her skin felt too tight, her thoughts too loud. </p><p>By the time her pager went off, she felt like she’d aged <em> ten years. </em> A sharp <em> beep-beep-beep, </em> pulling her back to reality like a slap to the face.</p><p>She groaned, rubbing her hands down her face before grabbing the device.</p><p>
<b> <em>Incoming Trauma. ETA 5 minutes. Multiple victims.</em> </b>
</p><p>That woke her up real fast.</p><p>She was up and moving before she even processed it, shoving her shoes back on and shrugging into her coat as she made her way to the ER.</p><p>The ambulance was already pulling in when she arrived.</p><p>Chaos. That was the only way to describe it.</p><p>The paramedics were rushing to unload the victims, shouting vitals and injuries as the trauma team scrambled to keep up.</p><p>“What do we have?” Agatha called out, slipping on a pair of gloves.</p><p>“Car accident,” one of the nurses responded. “Two victims, one critical. Drunk driver ran a red light and T-boned them.”</p><p>Her stomach twisted.</p><p>The first victim was already being wheeled past her, a man in his mid-thirties, bleeding from a deep head wound, his arm bent at an unnatural angle. Bad, but stable.</p><p>It was the second victim that set off alarms in her brain.</p><p>Young male. Maybe twenty. Barely conscious, his skin too pale, his breathing ragged.</p><p>“BP’s dropping fast”</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha muttered. “Get him to Trauma 1, now.”</p><p>They rushed him inside, and Agatha was right behind them.</p><p>The next thirty minutes were a fight.</p><p>The kid, Luke, according to his ID, was in bad shape. Internal bleeding. Possible ruptured spleen. Fractured ribs.</p><p>And a collapsed lung, because of course.</p><p>Agatha worked fast, barking orders as the team scrambled to keep up.</p><p>“Romel, get a chest tube in now”</p><p>“I’ve got it.”</p><p>Rio’s voice cut through the chaos, steady as ever.</p><p>She was already moving into position, her gloved hands precise as she worked. The tension in the room was thick, but she was focused, controlled. It was almost annoying how effortless she made it look.</p><p>Kate hovered nearby, wide eyed but determined, ready to assist.</p><p>“We need to get him up to the OR,” Agatha said, her voice sharp.</p><p>“Agreed,” Rio chimed in. “Let’s move.”</p><p>They barely had time to breathe before the elevator doors slammed shut behind them.</p><p>The OR was already a storm of movement by the time she arrived. Nurses moving in rapid succession, equipment being prepped, the beep-beep-beep of the monitors filling the air.</p><p>The surgery was long.</p><p>Luke’s spleen was beyond saving. The internal bleeding had been worse than expected, and for a moment, just a moment, Agatha wondered if they were losing him.</p><p>But somehow, they pulled him through.</p><p>By the time they were done, exhaustion had fully settled into her bones, her brain foggy from too many hours without sleep.</p><p>She peeled off her gloves, exhaling.</p><p>Rio, standing across from her, did the same. Their eyes met.</p><p>Something passed between them.</p><p>A moment of shared exhaustion. Of relief.</p><p>And then their pagers went off at the same time. </p><p>
<em> More bullshit. </em>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a glance before rushing out, still in their surgical gowns. In the waiting area, a fight was breaking out.</p><p>The fight in the waiting area was the last fucking straw.</p><p>One of Luke’s friends, mid-twenties, built like a linebacker, was trying to corner the guy who had been driving the other car.</p><p>The only reason he hadn’t succeeded was Romel physically holding him back.</p><p>“What the hell is going on?” Agatha snapped.</p><p>Kate, looking absolutely done with the day, crossed her arms. “This idiot found out the other driver was drunk and decided to throw hands.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>The guy wasn’t drunk, not legally, anyway. Just barely over the limit. Enough to be reckless. Not enough for an arrest.</p><p>But the damage was already done.</p><p>“Alright, enough!” Rio barked, her patience long gone. She stepped between them, glaring. “This is a hospital, not a goddamn boxing ring. If you want to beat the shit out of each other, do it outside.”</p><p>“I don’t care what you think,” Rio said, stepping between them. “This is a hospital. You start another fight, I will personally make sure you never see your friend again.”</p><p>The guy with bloody knuckles scowled. “I was defending him—”</p><p>“Not. My. Problem.” Rio cut him off, voice sharp as a scalpel. “If you start another fight, I will personally throw you out.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, unimpressed. “And if you so much as look at each other the wrong way, I’ll make sure security gets involved.”</p><p>The threat worked.</p><p>That shut him up real quick.</p><p>Grumbling, he backed off.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>She needed a drink. Or a nap.</p><p>Or maybe a lobotomy.</p><p>—--------------</p><p>By the time their shift ended, it was well past dawn.</p><p>Agatha just wanted to go home. She wanted to collapse onto her bed, bury herself under the covers, and forget the hellscape of the last twenty four hours. She wanted silence, sleep, and maybe, if she was feeling indulgent, an entire bottle of wine.</p><p>But fate, as always, had other plans.</p><p>She spotted Rio in the parking lot first, standing unnaturally still, her hands on her hips as she glared at her car like it had personally insulted her. Even from a distance, Agatha could see the tension in her shoulders, the unmistakable sharpness in her stance. Something was wrong.</p><p>Agatha frowned, picking up her pace. “What now?”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything at first. She just gave a pointed nod toward her car.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze followed, and her brows shot up.</p><p>All four of Rio’s tires? Slashed.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Agatha whistled low, stepping closer to inspect the damage. The deep gashes in the rubber were deliberate, angry. Someone had really put in the effort.</p><p>She exhaled sharply. “You piss someone off that bad?”</p><p>Rio shot her a dry look, and Agatha snorted. Fair.</p><p>They stood there in silence for a moment, both of them staring at the destroyed tires like they might magically fix themselves if they waited long enough.</p><p>Rio finally pulled out her phone. “I’ll just—”</p><p>“You should call the police,” Agatha interrupted.</p><p>Rio hesitated, glancing up at her.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “It was probably the friends of that guy from the accident. The ones who were causing a scene earlier.”</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, rubbing the bridge of it like she was warding off a headache. “Yeah. Probably.”</p><p>Agatha studied her, waiting. “So? You gonna call?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, shaking her head. “And say what? ‘Hi, officer, someone slashed my tires in a hospital parking lot, and I have absolutely no proof of who did it’? You think they’re gonna drop everything to investigate a misdemeanor?”</p><p>Agatha considered that. “They might look at the security cameras.”</p><p>Rio hummed noncommittally. “Mmh. I’ll talk to security later. Right now, I just want to go home.”</p><p>She tapped her phone screen, probably about to call an Uber.</p><p>And Agatha, stupidly, opened her mouth.</p><p>“I’ll drive you.”</p><p>The words left her before she could stop them, before she could think them through. And the second they were out, she regretted them.</p><p>Because Rio could just call an Uber. They both knew it. It would be easy, fast, impersonal. Logical.</p><p>She should’ve let her.</p><p>She should’ve just walked away, gotten into her own car, and driven home like a sane person.</p><p>But instead, she’d made the offer.</p><p>She’d invited Rio into her space, into her car, into her morning.</p><p>Why?</p><p>She didn’t know.</p><p>She told herself it was just the exhaustion talking, just the lingering guilt from their fight, just the stupid sense of responsibility that had been drilled into her since medical school, take care of your people, don’t leave them stranded.</p><p>Except Rio wasn’t her people.</p><p>Rio was… Rio.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t responsible for her.</p><p>But she’d still offered.</p><p>And now Rio was looking at her. Really looking at her. Like she was trying to figure something out.</p><p>“You don’t have to,” she said finally.</p><p>Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “I know I don’t have to. Just get in the damn car.”</p><p>For a second, Rio said nothing. Then—</p><p>That smirk.</p><p>The slow, knowing one. The one that made Agatha’s stomach turn on itself.</p><p>“Fair,” Rio murmured.</p><p>And just like that, she climbed into Agatha’s passenger seat.</p><p>—---------</p><p>
<span>The drive to Rio’s place was quiet.</span>
</p><p>Not awkward quiet, just… something quiet.</p><p>Agatha kept her focus on the road, hands steady on the wheel, while Rio sat in the passenger seat, head resting against the window. She looked exhausted, like the night had finally caught up to her, but she wasn’t sleeping.</p><p>She was just watching.</p><p>Not at her, obviously. Just watching the city lights blur past.</p><p>It was early on a sunday, the streets half-empty, the neon glow of storefronts flickering against the wet pavement. The rhythmic hum of the engine was the only sound between them, and for once, Agatha didn’t mind the silence. It was a relief after the chaos of their shift. After the fight. After the fucking car accident.</p><p>She had spent the entire night trying not to think about Rio. </p><p>But now, in the quiet of the car, with the city stretched out around them, it was harder to ignore.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s presence even now, warm in the seat beside her. Could sense the way she exhaled, deep and slow, like she was finally letting the weight of the night settle over her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know why she had offered to drive her. It was stupid. Irrational. </p><p>She just wanted to drop Rio off and go home.</p><p>By the time Agatha pulled up to Rio’s building, the other woman straightened, rubbing her eyes before unbuckling her seatbelt.</p><p>It was a nice place. Too nice.</p><p>Tall glass windows, sleek modern architecture, expensive. Exclusive. The kind of place where the doormen probably recognized every resident by name, where the lobby smelled like citrus and money.</p><p>It suited Rio.</p><p>Which, for some reason, annoyed the hell out of Agatha.</p><p>She had no reason to care. None. But there was something about the effortless way Rio fit here, like she belonged in places most people could only look at from the outside, that set her teeth on edge.</p><p>
<em> Not your problem, Harkness. Drop her off. Go home. </em>
</p><p>Rio opened the door, stepping out, the faint creak of leather breaking the silence. A beat passed before she leaned down, one arm resting against the car as she met Agatha’s gaze through the open window.</p><p>The streetlights cast a soft glow on her face, turning her eyes darker, sharper.</p><p>“Drive safe, doctora.”</p><p>Her voice was quieter now, almost lazy, and Agatha hated the way the word settled under her skin, warm and unwanted.</p><p>And then, just like that, she was gone.</p><p>Agatha didn’t watch her walk inside. She didn’t.</p><p>She just exhaled, fingers flexing against the wheel before putting the car in drive.</p><p>She needed sleep. Badly.</p><p>She drove home on autopilot, her brain fogged with exhaustion, her body heavy from the weight of the shift. Every bone in her body ached, her muscles screaming for rest.</p><p>By the time she pulled into her driveway, she barely had the energy to move.</p><p>She shut off the engine, grabbed her keys, and pushed open the door, the cold air hitting her like a slap.</p><p>Halfway to her front door, she saw it.</p><p>Something small, something dark, lying on the floor of the passenger seat.</p><p>Rio’s phone.</p><p>Agatha stopped short, staring at it.</p><p>For a long time.</p><p>She should leave it.</p><p>She could drop it off tomorrow. Rio probably wouldn’t even notice it was missing until she woke up. It wasn’t her problem.</p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Her fingers twitched.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair, exhaling sharply.</p><p>
<em> Just leave it. Just go inside. Go to sleep. This is not your problem. </em>
</p><p>But—</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, she turned right the hell back around.</p><p>------------------</p><p>
<span>By the time she reached Rio’s place again, it was 11.</span>
</p><p>The lobby was quiet, the kind of quiet that only happened at this hour on a sunday, where even the air felt heavy.. The overhead lighting was dimmed, the usual background hum of city life muffled into something softer, more distant. Even the scent of the place, clean linen, polished floors, money, felt subdued.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair as she approached the reception desk. Her patience was already paper-thin.</p><p>The receptionist, a guy who looked like he was in his late twenties, dark curls slightly disheveled, posture slouched with the kind of exhaustion that came from pulling too many late shifts, barely glanced up from his computer screen.</p><p>“Help you?” he mumbled, clearly uninterested.</p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers against the counter. “I need to find an apartment.”</p><p>That got his attention. He straightened slightly, eyeing her with mild suspicion. “Uh… residents only.”</p><p>She forced a tight smile. “Yeah, I figured. I just dropped Rio Vidal off earlier. She left her phone in my car.”</p><p>At the mention of Rio’s name, the guy’s entire demeanor shifted. His brows lifted slightly, lips parting as if he wasn’t quite sure how to process that information.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Yes. Rio. Vidal.”</p><p>“Are you on the list?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, already regretting every decision that had led her to this moment.</p><p>“No,” she said, voice flat. “But she just got home. I’m not some fucking stranger, and I don’t particularly feel like making a second trip here tomorrow, so—” she placed the phone onto the counter with a click, fingers drumming once against the surface. “Either call her, or tell me where she lives so I can knock on her damn door.”</p><p>The guy blinked.</p><p>Then, after a moment of consideration, he let out a slow breath and muttered, “Jesus,” under his breath before reaching for the desk phone. “What's your name?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness”</p><p>Agatha tapped her foot impatiently as he dialed.</p><p>A few seconds passed.</p><p>“Morning ms vidal. I've got Agatha harkness here”</p><p>“She’s here?”</p><p>Rio’s voice, muffled but unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha tried not to react to the way something in her chest tightened at the sound of it.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“…Send her up.”</p><p>The receptionist lowered the phone, still looking vaguely concerned about the whole thing, like he wasn’t entirely sure whether he should be letting her go up or calling security.</p><p>“She’s in 14C,” he said eventually.</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother responding.</p><p>She was already on her way.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t sure what she expected when the door finally swung open.</p><p>Rio half asleep, maybe. Hair messy, wrapped in a hoodie, muttering something half-coherent as she snatched the phone from her hands. That would’ve made sense. That would’ve been easy.</p><p>What she got was something else entirely.</p><p>Rio stood there, leaning against the doorway, freshly showered.</p><p>Dark hair still damp, curling slightly at the ends, droplets of water trailing down the slope of her neck. Her skin was bare, free of any makeup, the soft glow of the hallway lights casting golden shadows across the high angles of her cheekbones, the sharp curve of her jaw.</p><p>And—</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Oh, fuck. </em>
</p><p>She was wearing a sports bra, a bright pink one. And shorts. Tiny, black, sinful shorts.</p><p>Agatha’s brain stuttered.</p><p>Because of course Rio had abs. Of course she did.</p><p>Defined, lean muscle stretched over golden skin, every sharp angle and smooth curve honed to near perfection. She looked like she was carved from something ancient and dangerous, like she belonged on the cover of a magazine or standing under the glow of a spotlight, not just existing in some dimly lit apartment hallway at three in the morning.</p><p>Agatha felt her mouth go dry.</p><p>Rio, for her part, just looked at her. Then, very slowly, arched a brow.</p><p>“Something wrong?”</p><p>Agatha tore her gaze away, clearing her throat. “No.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look convinced.</p><p>Her lips twitched, just slightly, just enough to hint at the ghost of a smirk, and she crossed her arms over her chest, which did absolutely nothing to help Agatha’s situation.</p><p>“Did you drive all the way back here just to stare at me?”</p><p>I hate you.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said flatly, forcing herself to move, to focus, to not let her gaze drop lower. She held up the phone. “You left this in my car.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to the device in her hand. Then, after a beat, she sighed. “Of course I did.”</p><p>She reached out, fingers brushing against Agatha’s as she took the phone.</p><p>It was brief. Barely anything.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>Agatha ignored the way her stomach clenched, the heat that curled low in her spine.</p><p>Rio tapped the screen, checking something, before slipping the phone onto a nearby table. Then she looked back at Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you. You didn't have to”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“You wanna come in?”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>She should say no.</p><p>
<em> She should say no. </em>
</p><p>She should turn around, walk back to the elevator, and leave.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>“…Yeah,” she said. “Yeah, okay.”</p><p>And just like that, she stepped inside, and the first thing she noticed was that it didn’t smell like she expected.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what she had expected, something sharp, maybe, like the expensive perfume Rio always seemed to wear. Or something impersonal, sterile, like those luxury apartments that looked like a furniture catalog and nothing else.</p><p>But instead, the air was warm. Lived-in. A mix of fresh coffee, paint, and the faintest trace of something floral, jasmine, maybe?, lingering in a way that felt almost personal.</p><p>And the apartment itself…</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even realized she’d stopped moving until Rio let out a quiet, amused sound.</p><p>“Something wrong?”</p><p>Agatha ignored her, taking it all in.</p><p>The space was open and spacious but not cold. Unlike what she’d imagined, sleek, empty, detached, Rio’s home felt like a home.</p><p>There were bookshelves, actual bookshelves, filled with books that looked worn and well read. Some had spines that were cracked, others had dog eared pages sticking out at odd angles. There were art books stacked haphazardly next to crime novels, medical textbooks wedged between poetry collections.</p><p>But what caught Agatha’s attention were the plants.</p><p>
<em> Everywhere. </em>
</p><p>By the windows, on shelves, even hanging from the ceiling in delicate macrame holders. Different sizes, different shapes. Some leafy and wild, stretching toward the light, some small and delicate, thriving in ceramic pots.</p><p>“Didn’t peg you for a plant person,” Agatha muttered, stepping further inside.</p><p>Rio smirked, shutting the door behind them. “They’re hard to kill. Seemed like a safe investment.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, but her gaze was already moving, taking in the rest.</p><p>A piano stood against the far wall, sleek and black, looking well-loved but not dusty. A guitar rested beside it, propped against a chair. And in the corner, half-hidden by the couch, were painting supplies, canvases, brushes, tubes of acrylics. Some of the canvases were turned away, unfinished. Others had paint smudges on the edges, as if Rio had touched them with bare fingers.</p><p>Agatha felt something tight coil in her chest.</p><p>This wasn’t the apartment of someone who just existed.</p><p>
<em> This was the apartment of someone who felt. </em>
</p><p>She hadn’t expected that.</p><p>Rio was watching her again, arms still crossed, but there was something softer in her expression now.</p><p>“You look surprised.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, then back at the piano. “Didn’t think you’d have time for all this.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, like it was nothing. “I don’t. Not really. But…” she gestured vaguely to the instruments, the paints. “Some things make time for themselves.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to do with that.</p><p>So instead, she said nothing.</p><p>For a moment, the silence stretched. Not uncomfortable, exactly. Just… full.</p><p>Then Rio shifted, stretching her arms over her head, the movement making her abs flex in a way Agatha absolutely did not need to notice.</p><p>“I was about to hit the gym,” Rio said, voice casual.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “At this hour?”</p><p>“I like morning workouts.” Rio smirked. “Keeps me from killing anyone before noon.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, but Rio just tilted her head, considering.</p><p>“…Or,” she mused, “we could get brunch instead.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She should go home. She should shower, sleep, reset.</p><p>But…</p><p>The apartment was warm. Rio was looking at her like she already knew Agatha was considering it. Wanda was dropping Nicky off at six. She still had some time.</p><p>Agatha sighed, scrubbing a hand down her face. “…Fine,” she muttered. “But if you take me somewhere with overpriced avocado toast, I swear to God—”</p><p>Rio grinned, already moving toward the kitchen. “Relax, Harkness. I’ll cook.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted. “You cook?”</p><p>Rio cast a smirk over her shoulder. “What, you think I survive on protein shakes and spite?”</p><p>Agatha did think that, actually.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, grabbing a pan from the rack. “Sit down. You might even enjoy yourself.”</p><p>She had no idea why she was still here.</p><p>But she wasn’t leaving.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, running a hand through her hair before finally dropping onto the couch. </p><p>It was green. A deep, rich shade, the kind that looked soft before you even touched it. And when Agatha did sit, she had to admit, it was soft. The kind of soft that pulled at you, coaxing your body to relax even when your mind refused to.</p><p>She sighed, sinking into it, stretching her legs out slightly. She hadn’t realized how tired she was until now, until she let herself stop moving.</p><p>From the kitchen, Rio moved with the kind of easy familiarity Agatha could never quite manage in her own home. She reached for things without looking, opening cabinets, pulling out ingredients, setting the pan on the stove with practiced motions. Like she’d done this a thousand times before. Like this wasn’t something she had to think about.</p><p>Agatha didn’t cook much. She was never home much. Her house was a place to sleep, to shower, to store her things. A space where she existed, nothing more.</p><p>But this, this was something else.</p><p>This was a home.</p><p>She let her head fall back against the couch, exhaling.</p><p>"You want coffee?" Rio called over her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet huff. "I always want coffee."</p><p>Rio smirked, grabbing another mug.</p><p>The silence between them wasn’t uncomfortable. It was… different. Lighter than it had been last night.</p><p>Still, Agatha could feel the weight of it.</p><p>The unspoken thing.</p><p>She exhaled, dragging a hand through her hair before speaking.</p><p>"About last night."</p><p>Rio glanced at her, one brow raised. "What about it?"</p><p>Agatha shifted, tapping her fingers against her knee. "I was an asshole."</p><p>Rio let out a low hum. "Well, yeah."</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. "I meant—" She sighed, leaning forward, resting her elbows on her knees. "I was stressed. The shift was a fucking disaster, and I took it out on you."</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. "I shouldn’t have done that."</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then, very softly "No," Rio murmured. "You shouldn’t have."</p><p>The words weren’t sharp, but they weren’t gentle either. They just were. And that, somehow, was worse.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shifting slightly in her seat. “So. Truce?”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment, head tilting slightly.</p><p>Then, slowly, she smiled.</p><p>“Truce.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest loosened.</p><p>The space between them was too small.</p><p>Not enough to be dangerous. Not enough to be obvious.</p><p>Just enough to feel.</p><p>Agatha could see the way Rio’s skin was still damp from her shower, the way her hair curled slightly at the ends, dripping onto her shoulders. The way she smelled, something clean, sharp, undeniably her.</p><p>She swallowed, forcing her gaze upward, locking onto Rio’s eyes instead.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Because Rio was watching her.</p><p>Not teasing. Not smirking.</p><p>Just watching.</p><p>Like she was waiting for something.</p><p>Like she could see straight through Agatha’s skin, straight through the walls she kept so carefully in place.</p><p>It made her nervous.</p><p>And Agatha Harkness didn’t get nervous.</p><p>So she did the only thing she could do. She talked.</p><p>“You really stopped.” Her voice came out quieter than she intended, rough at the edges.</p><p>Rio didn’t move. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha wet her lips, her fingers digging into the couch. “Last night. You said you thought I wasn’t interested.”</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, tilting her head slightly. “Didn’t seem like you were.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, the words tangling in her throat. “I just—”</p><p>She clenched her jaw, looking away, staring at the piano in the corner like it could give her the right answer.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for it to feel like that,” she muttered finally.</p><p>Rio’s voice was even. “What did you mean for it to feel like?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, rubbing a hand over her face. “I don’t know.”</p><p>It wasn’t a lie.</p><p>She didn’t know.</p><p>She didn’t know why she had wanted Rio to push, even as she pulled away. Didn’t know why the distance had felt like relief and disappointment all at once. Didn’t know why, when Rio had finally listened and stopped, it had made something in her chest ache.</p><p>Rio watched her, silent for a long moment. Then—</p><p>“You really are a pain in the ass.”</p><p>Agatha let out a startled laugh.</p><p>It wasn’t mocking. It wasn’t cruel.</p><p>It was… fond. <em> Too fond. </em></p><p>Agatha shifted, the warmth of it making her restless. “Yeah, well. You’re not exactly a picnic either.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You say that, but here you are. Sitting on my couch. Eating my food.”</p><p>“I haven’t eaten anything yet.”</p><p>“Yet.”</p><p>The weight in the air didn’t ease.</p><p>If anything, it pressed closer.</p><p>Agatha could feel it, could feel the way Rio was leaning in without actually moving, the way their knees almost almost brushed.</p><p>Her pulse jumped.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” Rio murmured, voice low. “I backed off because I thought that’s what you wanted.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>She should nod. She should say <em> yes, that’s what I wanted. </em></p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, her mouth parted slightly, but no sound came out.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped, just for a second, before flicking back up.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped.</p><p>It was nothing.</p><p>
<em> Nothing. </em>
</p><p>A glance. A shift. A breath.</p><p>But suddenly, it didn’t feel like nothing.</p><p><em> Suddenly, Agatha was too aware of everything. </em>The way Rio’s skin gleamed in the soft light, the way the loose fit of her sports bra left her collarbones exposed, the way her shorts rode up just enough to show off the perfect definition of her legs.</p><p>Agatha tore her gaze away, cursing herself, but Rio caught it.</p><p>Of course she caught it.</p><p>And she grinned.</p><p>Not a full smirk. Not cocky.</p><p>Just pleased.</p><p>“You’re looking.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry. “You’re in a bra and tiny-ass shorts.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha scowled, hating how warm her face felt. “And you can’t blame me for looking.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened, slow and satisfied.</p><p>“Didn’t say I was blaming you.”</p><p>The air stretched tight again, humming between them like a wire about to snap.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, low and slow. “This is a bad idea.”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>Neither of them moved. Neither of them looked away.</p><p>Agatha should leave. She should get up, walk out, go home.</p><p>But her hands stayed locked against the couch, her body frozen in place, her eyes trapped in the deep, steady pull of Rio’s.</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, close enough that Agatha could feel the shift of air, the heat of her skin—</p><p>A fraction of an inch.</p><p>A breath.</p><p>A heartbeat.</p><p>It wouldn’t take much.</p><p>It wouldn’t take <em> anything. </em></p><p>Just—</p><p>One.</p><p>Small.</p><p>Move.</p><p>But before she could say anything else, Rio moved, just slightly, just enough that the distance between them shrank.</p><p>Not much. Barely anything.</p><p>But it felt like everything.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>She wasn’t sure who leaned in first.</p><p>All she knew was that suddenly, she could feel Rio’s warmth, could see the fine droplets of water still clinging to her collarbone, could hear the way her breath hitched, just slightly, as they got closer.</p><p>It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t careful.</p><p>It was just—</p><p>
<em> Inevitable. </em>
</p><p>The moment stretched, taut and electric, and for a second, just a second, Agatha thought she was about to drown in it.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered, dropping briefly to her lips, before lifting again. Her pupils were blown, her breathing slow, controlled, too controlled. Like she was holding herself back.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled against her knee.</p><p>She could feel her pulse at the base of her throat, fast and uneven.</p><p>It would be so easy.</p><p>Just a few inches. Just a breath.</p><p>And then—</p><p>Rio shifted, her knee pressing lightly against Agatha’s. Barely there. Just enough to set fire to the already burning air between them.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>"Tell me to stop," Rio murmured, voice low, careful. A thread of something dangerous wove through it.</p><p>Agatha parted her lips.</p><p>She should.</p><p>
<em> She should. </em>
</p><p>Instead, she tilted her chin up, ever so slightly.</p><p>And Rio… Rio took it as permission.</p><p>She leaned in, slow but deliberate, like she was giving Agatha time to pull away.</p><p>Agatha didn’t.</p><p>Her breath caught as Rio’s lips brushed against hers, just a ghost of a touch, light as air. Testing. Waiting.</p><p>And then Agatha closed the distance.</p><p>A sharp inhale, a shift of weight, and then Rio was kissing her, warm and firm and completely unhurried.</p><p>It wasn’t soft. It wasn’t hesitant.</p><p>It was slow.</p><p>Intentional.</p><p>Like Rio had decided to kiss her and was going to make damn sure Agatha felt it.</p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p>Every inch of it.</p><p>The way Rio’s lips moved against hers, the way her hand lifted, slowly, carefully, to brush against Agatha’s jaw. The heat of her palm, the way her fingers curled slightly when Agatha sucked in a breath.</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart was pounding.</p><p>She didn’t do this. She didn’t let herself—</p><p>But Rio…Rio kissed her like she had all the time in the world.</p><p>Like she was memorizing her.</p><p>And Agatha…Agatha let her.</p><p>It was slow at first. Tentative. Just the soft press of lips.</p><p>But then it wasn’t.</p><p>Agatha's hands moved, unbidden, reaching for Rio, threading through the damp strands of her hair, pulling her closer, deeper into the kiss. And Rio responded, meeting her, straddling her on the couch. The kiss turned hungry, urgent, like it had been building for far longer than either of them cared to admit.</p><p>Their mouths moved together, the tension between them unspooling in waves of heat. Agatha could feel the soft curve of Rio’s lips, the delicate press of her body against hers. Rio tasted like salt and something wild, something that made Agatha lose control of the steady rhythm her mind always tried to maintain.</p><p>Rio’s hands found her waist, her fingers warm and firm as they slid around her, pressing her closer until there was no more space. Until they were tangled together, a mess of lips and hands and breath.</p><p>The kiss was frantic, desperate almost, but still full of that sweet, slow burn, like they were both too afraid to break it, to step away, to stop for fear of losing whatever this was.</p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, just an inch, just enough to breathe, her chest was heaving. Her lips tingled. Her mind spun, dizzy and caught in the aftershocks of what had just happened.</p><p>“God,” she breathed, her voice raw, unsteady.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were dark, lips swollen, chest rising and falling with the same frantic energy.</p><p>“You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for that,” Rio murmured, her voice low, almost a whisper.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse hammered in her ears. She opened her mouth to speak but couldn’t form the words.</p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p>Because Rio leaned in again, this time faster, fiercer. And Agatha met her halfway, kissing her again, this time with all the frustration, all the tension that had built up between them. It was reckless now. Neither of them bothered with gentleness, just the raw, undeniable need that had been bubbling under the surface for what felt like forever.</p><p>It was everything. It was a kiss that could burn down cities. </p><p>And Agatha didn’t want to stop.</p><p>The air between them was thick, charged with an electricity neither of them had been prepared for. Each touch was like a spark that set off another, building something more dangerous, more intense. Rio’s hands were everywhere, on Agatha’s hips, her back, her shoulders, pulling her closer, pushing her against the back of the couch. Agatha could feel the heat of Rio’s body against hers, the soft press of her curves, and it made her breath catch.</p><p>It was all so new. <em> So undeniably new. </em>The way Rio kissed, the way she touched, was different, far more intimate than anything Agatha had ever experienced. She didn’t know how to react, but she knew she didn’t want it to stop.</p><p>But then Rio pulled back, just enough to breathe, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, her eyes dark and intense.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was still pounding, but now she felt something else too. A deep seated uncertainty, something she couldn’t shake. The heat of the moment was still there, swirling in the air, but Rio had paused, giving Agatha just enough space to become aware of the tension in her own chest.</p><p>Rio’s voice was soft, but the question hung in the air like a challenge.</p><p>Rio’s breath was warm against her lips, her forehead still resting lightly against Agatha’s, their bodies pressed close, every nerve on high alert.</p><p>Then, softly, carefully, Rio asked, “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p>Agatha barely let her finish the question before she scoffed, breathless. “Do I look like I want you to stop?”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, her fingers tightening just slightly where they rested against Agatha’s hips. “I don’t know. You’re kind of hard to read.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, arching a brow. “Yeah? What about me grabbing your face and kissing you back was hard to read?”</p><p>Rio grinned, a slow, lazy thing, her lips still just barely brushing against Agatha’s. “We've been here before Harkness”</p><p>Rio just stares at her, her face way too close. Agatha realizes the proximity of it is threatening, a statement of its own to stand near enough to breathe on her skin, to almost brush the tips of their noses, but to Agatha it simultaneously feels like more, and she hates that, too.</p><p>Agatha grits her teeth and straightens in place as she tries not to think about it, about how close they are and the warmth of Rio’s skin. She tries not to think about it because she knows her imagination is the root of all her problems. But her mind wanders and imagines; Rio’s lips on her own again, the sharp scrape of her teeth. Her mouth dries up at the thought of it. How appalling.</p><p>Agatha’s mind was a whirlwind, her thoughts spinning too fast to catch, but one thing was clear: she didn’t want this to stop. Not now. Not ever.</p><p>Rio’s lips brushed against hers again, light and teasing, before she pulled back just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze. Her eyes were dark, intense, searching. “Tell me what you like,” she said, her voice soft but firm. “What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha froze, her heart pounding in her chest. The question hung in the air between them, heavy and loaded. She opened her mouth to respond, but the words caught in her throat. Because the truth was, she didn’t know. She’d never been with a woman before, Jesus she didn't even enjoy her sex life with her ex husband that much. She’d never even let herself think about it, not really. Not like this</p><p>Rio must have seen the hesitation in her eyes because she leaned in, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear as she whispered, “It’s okay. We can figure it out together.”</p><p>“I'd like that” Agatha murmured. </p><p>Rio pauses briefly, her tongue poking out to wet her pink, full lips. Her eyes deepen into something gray and sinister. The next thing she knows is that Rio’s got a hand around the back of her neck, pulling her into a rough kiss.</p><p>It hurts when Rio’s lips meet her own again . It’s violent. Her teeth press against her own lips, and Agatha makes a sound of pain that Rio matches with one of frustration. Rio tastes bitter, like remnants of her morning coffee and the color of rage and anger.</p><p>The right thing to do would be to pull away, but it’s hard to form any coherent thought when Rio steps into her and slams her up against the back of the couch with enough force to bruise, Agatha whines from the back of her throat, glaring daggers at Rio, but the other woman just laces her fingers into Agatha’s hair and tugs a little too hard to be an accident.</p><p>“Tug my hair one more time,” Agatha warns. “And I swear—”</p><p>Rio does just that, and the sound Agatha makes is supposed to be annoyed, it is, only it isn’t. It isn’t at all. “What? Seems like you like it,” Rio grunts against her mouth.</p><p>That damn—</p><p>Agatha can’t even finish her thought when Rio’s fingers twist into the roots of her hair and redden her scalp, making her brain feel raw with the force of her tugs. Her heart thumps violently in her chest; her neck and ears are burning. Suddenly she feels as if her body has too much blood circulating in it, and it is going in all the wrong places. It was too much and not enough at the same time. She needed more. </p><p>With all the courage she managed to gather one of her hands left Rio's hair and made its way down. She gently caressed her neck, and then her exposed clavicles. She rested it on the middle of her breast, on top of the sports bra. As if sensing she was holding back, without breaking the kiss she reached down, taking Agatha's hand and placing it on top of her breast. Both of their breaths hitched at the contact. </p><p>It felt like something broke open between them, like a dam unleashing its fury, a heat wave sweeping through their bodies. Agatha pushed back, this time with everything she had, her fingers curling tighter around Rio’s breast as if daring her to be the one to stop now.</p><p>Rio was not backing down. She growled against Agatha’s lips, wild and ferocious, shifting to press her thigh between Agatha's legs. Agatha's entire body jolted, sensation ricocheting everywhere at once, letting out a filthy moan. She's sure she's never let out a sound like that before, not even close to that. It was enough to make her dizzy; it was enough to make her gasp against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“You’re being so—” Rio said, breaking just long enough for Agatha to hear the breathless awe in her voice.</p><p>“Don’t say it,” Agatha warned. Her cheeks flamed, and she didn’t know if it was from embarrassment or the sheer intensity of what she was feeling. </p><p>“Good,” Rio finished, her breath hot and ragged.</p><p>Agatha’s mind was an incoherent jumble. Her blood roared in her ears, and there was a warmth spreading through her that made her feel weak and alive all at once. She tightened her grip on Rio, pulling her closer, needing to feel more of her, all of her.</p><p>Rio’s hands were everywhere again, urgent and demanding. Her lips moved from Agatha’s mouth to her jaw to her neck, leaving a trail of heat in their wake. Agatha shivered, the sensation electrifying, every nerve ending on fire.</p><p>Rio’s hand left Agatha’s hair, trailing down her side until her fingers found the hem of Agatha’s scrub shirt. She stopped kissing her, pulling back just enough to look straight into Agatha’s eyes. Her pupils were blown, dark and hungry, and the intensity of her gaze made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky gasp, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Seeing Rio like this, so undone, so desperate, sent a shiver down her spine. Knowing that Rio wanted this as much as she did, that she was just as affected, just as consumed, made her feel dizzy with want.</p><p>“Can I?” Rio asked softly, her fingers still gripping the bottom of Agatha’s shirt, her voice rough with need but laced with a tenderness that made Agatha’s heart ache.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her mind racing even as her body screamed for more. She nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. Her hands slid under the fabric, her touch warm and firm against Agatha’s skin. Rio slowly started to lift Agatha's shirt, and she helped her by lifting her arms, leaving her in a black dress and purple scrub pants. She felt exposed. Rios eyes wandered through the new exposed skin.  Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers traced the curve of her waist, sending sparks of electricity shooting through her. The sensation was overwhelming, and Agatha’s hands flew to Rio’s shoulders, gripping tightly as if to anchor herself.</p><p>Rio’s lips found hers again, this time softer, slower, as if she was savoring every second. Her hands continued their exploration, moving up Agatha’s back, pulling her closer. Agatha could feel the heat of Rio’s body against hers, skin to skin, Rio’s abs tightening against her own,</p><p>When Rio’s fingers brushed against the clasp of her bra, she paused, pulling back just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze again. “Still okay?” she asked, her voice low and rough, but with gentleness that made Agatha’s chest tighten.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her breath coming in short, uneven gasps. “Yes,” she said again, her voice trembling but firm. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile, and then she was kissing her again, deeper this time, more insistent. Her hands moved to the front after deftly undoing the clasp and sliding the fabric away. Agatha’s breath shuddered as Rio’s hands found her bare skin, her touch sending waves of heat through her.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio murmured against her lips, her voice filled with awe.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, but she didn’t look away. She couldn’t. Not when Rio was looking at her like that. Her hands slid up Rio’s neck, tangling in her hair as she kissed her back with more confidence as the heat between them grew.</p><p>Rio’s lips moved from Agatha’s mouth to her jaw to her neck, leaving a trail of heat in their wake. Agatha shivered, the sensation electrifying, every nerve ending on fire. When Rio’s lips found the sensitive spot just below her ear, Agatha let out a soft moan, her fingers tightening in Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Jesus,” she breathed, her voice trembling.</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to meet her gaze, her eyes dark with desire. “ God you sound so good like this” she paused and brought her lips back to Agatha's neck “Tell me what you want,” she said, her voice low and rough. “Tell me, and I’ll give it to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind was spinning, her body on fire. She didn’t know what she wanted. She didn’t know what she was doing. But she knew one thing: she didn’t want this to stop. Not now. Not ever.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted, her voice trembling. “But I want… I want you to show me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips lingered for a moment longer against Agatha’s neck, her breath warm and uneven, before she suddenly pulled back. Agatha’s eyes flew open, her chest heaving as she stared at Rio, confusion and insecurity flooding her. Why was she stopping? Had she done something wrong? Was this it? Her mind raced, her heart pounding as she tried to make sense of what was happening.</p><p>Rio stood up, her movements slow and deliberate, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s. For a moment, Agatha felt exposed, vulnerable, like she’d been stripped bare in more ways than one. She opened her mouth to say something, to ask, to protest, to beg, but no words came out. She just sat there, frozen, her hands trembling at her sides.</p><p>Then Rio extended a hand, her expression softening as she looked down at Agatha. “Come on,” she said, her voice low and steady, but with a warmth that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her mind still reeling. “What?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a small, reassuring smile. “You said you wanted me to show you,” she said, her tone gentle but firm. “So let me show you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her heart racing as she stared at Rio’s outstretched hand. This was it. This was the point of no return. If she took Rio’s hand, if she followed her, there was no going back. No pretending this hadn’t happened. No pretending she didn’t want this, want her with every fiber of her being.</p><p>For a moment, she hesitated. Her mind screamed at her to stop, to think, to pull back before it was too late. But her body, her traitorous, reckless body, had other ideas. </p><p>Slowly, tentatively, she reached out and took Rio’s hand. Rio’s fingers closed around hers, warm and firm, and she pulled Agatha to her feet. Agatha’s legs felt unsteady, her body still buzzing with the aftershocks of what had just happened, but Rio’s grip was steady, grounding her.</p><p>“Trust me,” Rio said softly, her eyes searching Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight. She didn’t trust easily. She didn’t let people in. But Rio… Rio was different. Rio had always been different. And as much as it terrified her, she knew she couldn’t walk away now. Not when Rio was looking at her like that. Not when she felt like this.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling but firm.</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, just slightly, and then she was leading Agatha through the apartment, their fingers still intertwined. Agatha’s heart pounded with every step, her mind a whirlwind of fear and anticipation. She didn’t know where they were going, what Rio had planned, but she knew one thing: there was no turning back now.</p><p>As they reached the doorway to Rio’s bedroom, Rio paused, turning to look at Agatha one last time. Her eyes were dark, intense, but there was a softness there too, a tenderness that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>“You sure?” Rio asked, her voice low and rough, but with a vulnerability that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her breath catching in her throat. “I’m sure.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile, and then she was pulling Agatha into the room, closing the door behind them. The air between them was thick, charged with an electricity that made Agatha’s skin tingle. She could feel the heat of Rio’s body, the way her heart was pounding just as fast as her own.</p><p>And as Rio’s lips found hers again, soft and insistent, Agatha knew she was lost. </p><p>
<em> Completely, utterly lost.  </em>
</p><p>And for the first time in her life, she didn’t care.</p><p><br/>

<p>
<span>Rio's hands found Agatha's waist as she guided her backward toward the bed, their lips never parting. The backs of Agatha's knees bumped against the edge of the mattress, and she gasped as Rio gave her a gentle push, easing her down until she felt the cool dark green sheets against her back. Rio followed without hesitation, climbing on top to straddle her hips, a slow, deliberate movement that made Agatha's breath catch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of Rio's body pressing into hers sent a jolt of electricity through her veins. It was grounding and disorienting all at once, as if her body couldn't decide whether to cling to the moment or shatter under its intensity. She could feel every inch of Rio, the press of her thighs, the subtle shift of her hips, the steady rhythm of her breath ghosting over her cheek, and it made her head spin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands slid up instinctively, palms grazing warm skin until her fingers found the dip of Rio’s waist, just above the waistband of her shorts. Her touch lingered there, fingertips digging slightly into the soft flesh, not to anchor Rio but to remind herself that this was really happening, that this heat between them wasn’t something conjured from her imagination in one of her dreams. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips trailed along her collarbone, teeth grazing lightly, and Agatha arched into the sensation, her fingers threading through Rio’s thick wet hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The strands were still damp from her shower, cool and heavy between her fingers, a stark contrast to the warmth of Rio’s mouth. The air prickled against Agatha’s bare chest, the absence of her bra making every breath feel raw, unshielded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed a path down to the hollow of her throat, and Agatha’s breath hitched. The press of skin on skin wasn’t new, they’d kissed before, touched before. But not like this. </span>
<em>
<span>Definitely not like this.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Not with her stripped down to nerve and bone, not with this terrifying heat pooling in her stomach. She could feel the tremor in her own body, a low, pulsing thrum that started deep in her spine and worked its way outward. Her breath came shallow, her muscles tense even as she clung to Rio’s warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio felt it too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stilled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not completely, not all at once, but enough. Enough to make Agatha freeze too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re shaking,” Rio murmured, voice soft and muffled against Agatha’s skin. Her hands pressed gently against Agatha’s ribs, grounding her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t pull away, didn’t break the contact, but she shifted, lifting herself just enough to see Agatha’s face. Her palms slid to Agatha’s sides, steady and warm against her ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit up a little,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She guided her gently, helping Agatha shift upright against the headboard. Rio stayed close, never losing contact, knees bracketing Agatha’s hips, still straddling her. The intimacy of the position was inescapable, so was the heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Agatha whispered, throat dry, voice brittle. Her pulse was a drumbeat, frantic under the surface, not just from Rio’s touch, but from the overwhelming reality of this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Exposed.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands lingered, thumbs brushing against bare skin, subtle and deliberate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a terrible liar,”  she said, her tone teasing but tender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, somewhere between a huff and a sigh. “I’m not lying,” she snapped, then paused, dragging her fingers through her hair like she could smooth out the chaos in her brain. “I’m… adjusting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio quirked a brow, and her lips curved in that maddening way that made Agatha want to punch something, or kiss her. </span>
<em>
<span>Or both. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah. So you’re overwhelmed by my charm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I’m overwhelmed by the urge to smother you with a pillow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, “Is that a kink reveal?” she asked innocently. “Because we can work with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands. “Oh my god, you are insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet,” Rio said, stepping in, her grin slow and delicious, “here you are. Half naked. In my arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made her go still. She crossed her arms over her chest, shoulders drawn tight like she could brace against the heat between them. Rio’s eyes didn’t drop, didn’t ogle or leer. She just looked at her. Saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated it. Hated how seen she felt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped in, close enough that her breath warmed Agatha’s cheek. “Second thoughts?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yes. Absolutely. </span>
<em>
<span>Always.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not used to not knowing what I’m doing,” she blurted before she could stop herself. The words were raw, scraping out of her like a confession.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t mock her. Didn’t smirk. She just nodded, gentle and maddeningly patient. “You’re not supposed to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “That’s not comforting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence fell, thick and heavy. Then Rio tilted her head, a teasing glint sparking in her eyes. “Well,” she murmured, “lucky for you, I'm pretty good with my mouth"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, well that makes it </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much better,” Agatha muttered, sarcasm cutting through the vulnerability like armor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile turned soft again, which only made Agatha more defensive. She tightened her arms over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said gently, stepping forward, hands hovering like she wanted to reach out but wouldn’t without permission. “You’re allowed to be nervous. And we can stop this if you don't want to keep going”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I’m not nervous.” she snapped “and were not stopping”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. “Just deeply uncomfortable and vibrating like a scared Chihuahua?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s more like it,” Rio said, grinning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha peeked at her through her fingers, deadpan. “Don’t flatter yourself. This proximity is pure biology… survival instinct.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers brushed lightly over her hips. “Survival instinct brought you into my bedroom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, ready to fire back something cutting, something smart, but then Rio leaned in and pressed her lips just beneath her ear, and the rest of the sentence completely abandoned her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thought so,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s skin prickled. She hated how good that felt. How easy Rio made it to unravel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She inhaled slowly, trying to collect herself, but her brain was all static. Warm, buzzing static. And the worst part? Rio knew. She could feel her smirking against her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really get off on being smug, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back and locked her eyes onto hers. “Only when I’m right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a look. “You’re never right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow. “Is that why you kissed me first?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flushed instantly. “That’s, technically-” She spluttered. “That doesn’t count.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it counts,” Rio said, grinning now. “It counts a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, dragging both hands down her face. “Why are you like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Chronic charm disorder. Terminal, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a strangled, exasperated noise. “Just shut up,” she muttered, eyes flashing. “And kiss me before I come to my senses”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the distance slowly, giving Agatha that final sliver of space to back away if she wanted, she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their mouths met again, this time slower, deeper, less urgent, more intentional. Agatha’s hands trembled where they hovered between them, not sure where to land. She kept her chest half covered, the heat of Rio’s body making her feel suddenly, achingly aware of every inch of bare skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back just enough to look at her, eyes kind, voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said gently, reaching up to touch Agatha’s cheek. “It’s okay. You don’t have to cover yourself”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her breath shaky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded toward her own chest, voice almost shy beneath the teasing edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can take it off, if you want,” she murmured, fingers hooking briefly under the hem of her sports bra. “Or not. I don’t mind. You can touch me too, Agatha. If you want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That permission, that simple, open if, unlocked something in Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her a moment longer, chest rising and falling with uneven breath. Then, slowly, she reached forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're insane,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm,” Rio whispered</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t answer with words. Instead, slowly, tentatively, she reached out, her fingers brushing the fabric at the edge of Rio’s bra, then hesitating again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a breath and nodded, more to herself than to Rio, and let her fingers slip under the edge of the fabric. Rio made a soft sound of surprise, hands moving to Agatha’s waist. She hesitated when her thumbs brushed bare skin, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sports bra clung slightly to Rio’s skin, damp with sweat and heat, and Agatha moved carefully, reverently. She slid the fabric upward, her knuckles grazing against the underside of Rio’s breasts, and felt the slight hitch in Rio’s breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the bra came off, Rio dropped it wordlessly to the floor, letting it land with a soft, wet thud. She didn’t speak, didn’t rush, just stood there in the low light, bare to Agatha in a way that felt like more than physical. Her posture was relaxed, unguarded, offering herself without demand or pressure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's hands hovered in midair for a moment, unsure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for one of them gently, threading their fingers together, and guided Agatha’s palm to her chest. “You can touch me,” she said again, quieter now, not because she was uncertain but because the moment didn’t need volume. “It’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand trembled as she settled it over Rio’s heart. Her skin was warm, her heartbeat strong and steady beneath her palm. She let her thumb graze upward, tracing the curve of Rio’s breast, her breath catching at the intimacy of it, at how alive it all felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned into the touch, her lips brushing the edge of Agatha’s jaw, a kiss feather light but sure. “You’re doing fine,” she murmured, mouth moving softly against her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's breath caught at the sight,  the smooth expanse of Rio's skin glowing in the dim light, the way her dark hair cascaded over one shoulder. She was breathtaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Like what you see?" Rio murmured, her voice husky as she traced a finger along Agatha's collarbone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her mouth suddenly dry. "Shut up," she muttered, but there was no bite to it. She reached up, letting her fingers tangle in Rio's hair as she pulled her back down for another searing kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into the kiss, her hands exploring Rio's body with a boldness that surprised even her. She could feel every inch of her, every curve, every line of muscle beneath soft skin, and she wanted more. She wanted everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body moved on instinct now, no longer shackled by thought or hesitation. Not with Rio’s hands tracing fire across her ribs. Not with every nerve ending sparking to life under her touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back slightly, her eyes dark with something tender and dangerous all at once. She pressed a hand gently to Agatha’s shoulder, guiding her backward until she was lying flat against the sheets. The fabric was cool beneath her, but the contrast only made Rio’s warmth more intense, more anchoring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at her, breath shallow, eyes wide. She didn’t speak, didn’t need to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio settled over her with practiced ease, her thighs straddling Agatha’s hips, her palms braced on either side of her shoulders. She dipped low again, lips trailing across Agatha’s neck in a slow, deliberate line. Her teeth grazed lightly over the hollow of her throat, right where her pulse fluttered wild and frantic, and Agatha gasped, a sound that turned into a quiet moan when Rio’s mouth lingered there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked against her skin, the curve of it maddening. Agatha was aware of her nipples hardening and her chest rising and falling more erratically now that she have garnered the full attention of the woman sitting on top off her. She moved lower, kisses trailing down like falling stars until her lips brushed the top of Agatha’s breast, slow, reverent,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's heart rate skyrocketed, her skin burning wherever Rio's lips touched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio continued her exploration, Agatha’s breath hitched when Rio’s tongue traced a slow, lazy circle around her nipple, not quite touching where she craved it most. A tremor ran through her legs, sharp and sudden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her entire body was trembling now. She gripped at the sheets beneath her, trying to anchor herself to something, anything, but the only thing that felt real was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's legs felt weak, her entire body trembling with desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn't know how much more of this she could take.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fuck," she gasped, her voice hoarse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I plan on it," Rio murmured, her lips ghosting over the curve of Agatha's breast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's hands gripped Agatha's hips, pulling her closer as her mouth moved lower, kissing a heated trail down her abdomen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's breath hitched, her hands tangling tightly in Rio’s hair as she struggled to stay upright under the weight of sensation. Her entire body felt like it was buzzing, each breath sharp, every nerve set alight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced up, pausing just enough to ground them both. “You okay?” she asked softly, voice still low, but laced with concern beneath the heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard. Her throat was dry, her pulse pounding in her ears, her whole body flushed and trembling. “Yeah,” she breathed. Then, with a flicker of her usual sharpness, “If you stop now, I’ll bite you for real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin spread slowly, dark and amused. “Don’t threaten me with a good time,” she murmured, voice rough like smoke, her breath skimming over Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When her fingers slipped down to the waistband of Agatha’s scrub pants, she paused again, pulling back just far enough to meet her gaze. The room fell silent, save for the sound of their uneven breathing. The question was there, unspoken, but crystal clear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. “Yes,” she whispered, the word nearly caught in her throat. Then, to punctuate it, she lifted her hips slightly, a wordless gesture of surrender. Of want.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile turned razor sharp. She hooked her fingers into the waistband and slid the fabric down with a slow, practiced motion, leaving a trail of goosebumps in her wake. Agatha gasped as the air hit her bare skin, the contrast making her skin prickle, her breath catch in her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pants were tossed aside carelessly, forgotten. Rio’s hands returned immediately, palms gliding up Agatha’s thighs with infuriating slowness, thumbs tracing circles as she moved. Each touch was deliberate, as though she were reading something written on Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head tipped back, a low sound escaping her. It was too much. And yet, not enough. The press of fingers on sensitive skin, the weight of Rio’s gaze, the heat that coiled tighter and tighter inside her with every passing second, it was overwhelming in the most dizzying, delicious way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never felt like this before. The sensation of being touched like this was new and raw and almost too much to hold in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was unraveling. And she didn’t want it to stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands, still tangled in Rio’s hair, tightened their grip, not to push away, but to pull her closer, as though anchoring herself to the only solid thing in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Agatha began, then faltered, chest heaving. She blinked up at Rio, overwhelmed by the intensity in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a kiss to the inside of her thigh, slow and sure, then looked up through her lashes with eyes that burned and soothed all at once. “Breathe,” she whispered again, voice like silk pulled taut. “I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her fingers curling tightly into the sheets. Her skin burned everywhere Rio touched, even in the places she hadn’t yet. She was trembling, unable to still the electric thrum that coursed through her with every teasing brush of skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio’s thumb pressed lightly against her through the fabric of her underwear, gentle, deliberate, devastating. A jolt of pleasure shot through her like lightning, sharp and fast. Her knees buckled, and she might have collapsed entirely if Rio hadn’t already been holding her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s arm wrapped more firmly around her hip, anchoring her. Her other hand didn’t stop, didn’t falter, as she drew slow, coaxing circles on top of the damped fabric, her movements maddeningly controlled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god,” Agatha breathed, barely recognizing her own voice. It was hoarse, fractured, stretched thin by need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t even sure what she was asking for when she whispered, “Please.” Her voice cracked on the word, so fragile it barely reached the air. She didn’t know what she needed, just that it was everything. Her body was humming, every nerve drawn tight, the pressure inside her unbearable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” she repeated, as if saying it again would make sense of this wild, unstoppable feeling building inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her smile softening around the edges. “You’re so responsive,” she said, almost to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s stomach, slow and reverent. “I love it,” she murmured against her skin, her voice vibrating in a way that made Agatha shiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to speak, tried to say something clever or biting or even coherent, but nothing came. Only breath and heat and a quiet, broken sound in the back of her throat. Her mind was blank, wiped clean by sensation, by the sight of Rio between her thighs, by the way her lips left burning trails wherever they landed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, finally, Rio’s fingers dipped beneath the edge of her underwear. Just the brush of fingertips against her bare skin made Agatha gasp, her back arching off the bed like a bow pulled tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck—” she choked, voice rough, nearly desperate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” Rio soothed, her tone gentle but sure. She pressed a kiss to Agatha’s hipbone, soft and steady, as if trying to ground her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body trembled beneath her, strung so tight she felt like she might shatter. Every part of her was focused on where Rio touched her, on the building pressure, on the impossibility of holding it all in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers slipped beneath the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, and she paused just long enough to press another kiss low on her abdomen. Then, with practiced ease and gentle hands, she began to slide the fabric down. Inch by inch, baring her, revealing her completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught again, less from the sensation and more from the exposure, the sheer intimacy of it. She was bare now, all of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed the underwear aside and settled back, her hands tracing idle patterns along the inside of Agatha’s thighs, slow and soothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio looked up, her voice soft, coaxing. “Show me what you like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body, flushed and aching only a second ago, went rigid. Her eyes widened. “What?” she said, though she’d heard her perfectly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver. “I want to know what feels good for you. What you like. Show me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped, stuttered. Her mouth opened, then closed. Her hands clenched in the sheets beside her hips. “I— I don’t...” Her voice trailed off, and color rushed to her face</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cheeks were burning now, mortified by the admission. Her throat tightened, shame curling in her stomach like a fist. She couldn’t meet Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stilled, immediately sensing the shift in her. The tension, the uncertainty, the quiet panic that had replaced all that desperate want.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said gently, brushing a thumb along Agatha’s hipbone. “It’s okay. Look at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then finally let her gaze drift back to Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, still flushed. “It’s just, I don’t know what I like. Not really. It always felt... weird. Or like I was doing it wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened completely. “You’re not doing anything wrong,” she said firmly, then leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the space just below Agatha’s navel. “We’ll figure it out </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up again, her eyes steady. “Just tell me what feels good. That’s all. You don’t have to know everything right now. “</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands unclenched from the sheets slowly, her chest still tight but her breath coming easier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, and it wasn’t wicked this time. It was kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a bold grab. Not a rush. Just the backs of Rio’s fingers, slow and barely there, grazing along the most sensitive part of her with maddening restraint. Feather, light. Measured. Intentional.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The contact was almost nothing, just the whisper of skin against skin, but it unraveled Agatha like a pulled thread. Her breath hitched sharply, her back arching instinctively. That delicate stroke sent a ripple of sensation through her body, a shiver starting low in her spine and radiating outward, leaving her trembling in its wake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t press. Didn’t tease. Just kept tracing those languid, reverent paths, like she was mapping the most sacred part of her with the same patience she used to paint, slow layers, gentle pressure, deliberate motion. Agatha could feel each pass as if it were being etched into her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t think too about it,” Rio murmured, her voice thick and low, the words sliding over Agatha’s skin like a second touch. “You let yourself feel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, sharp and involuntary, her hands fisting in the sheets. The pleasure wasn’t explosive, not yet, but it was deep, coiling, spreading. Tight and low and urgent. A flame lit behind her belly, heat curling with every breath, every pass of those maddening fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God,” Agatha whispered, the word catching like static in her throat. Her legs trembled with how close she suddenly felt, without being rushed, without even knowing how she got there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was unbearable.  And Rio hadn’t even really started.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cried out, whole body lifting into Rio’s touch, rocking to pull Rio’s fingers down through her folds, the wet sound of her fingers sliding between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck Agatha,” Rio whispered. “You’re so wet…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nearly burst into flames, the hot flush spreading from her aching clit through her whole body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped against Rio’s shoulder, her breath catching as she moved desperately against the fingers sliding into her, slow, warm, coaxing touches that shifted between teasing and intent. The slick heat made everything feel blurred, overwhelming, but when Rio’s thumb found her clit and circled with firm pressure, it sent a fresh wave of pleasure crashing through her. The sound that left her mouth shattered through the room, hot and loud. Her hips lifted instinctively, chasing more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath came hot and uneven, ghosting over Agatha’s cheek as her fingers shifted, circling with soft, deliberate strokes. Agatha turned her head slightly, her gaze lifting, and met Rio’s face, flushed and focused, eyes dark, pupils blown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drank in every sound Rio made, greedy for it, her breath syncing with each breathless moan as Rio’s fingers continued their relentless circles over her clit. The heat inside her was winding tighter, spiraling in molten coils that gathered low in her belly, demanding all of Rio’s attention, all of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clung to Rio’s back, nails pressing into firm muscle, the soft press of Rio’s breasts against hers making her dizzy. Another moan slipped from Rio’s lips, raw and low, echoing off the walls like it belonged to both of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio shifted, pulling Agatha closer still, her weight pressing down in a way that pinned her, anchored her, made her feel owned and held and wanted all at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God…” Rio breathed, lips sticking. “You feel so good…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tipped her head back with a sharp cry, her breath coming in ragged bursts against Rio’s skin. Her fingertips dug into the shifting muscles of Rio’s back, feeling them flex and roll beneath her palms as Rio moved, kissing her way down, slow and purposeful, leaving a trail of heat in her wake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, her mouth closed over Agatha’s nipple. Wet. Hot. Sucking deep and slow, tongue flicking, teasing, relentless. Agatha gasped, hips twitching, the sensation sharp and all consuming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wouldn’t take much more, not with the tight, frantic coil winding inside her, not with the sharp burn of pleasure radiating from her clit under Rio’s relentless thumb. The sensation sparked straight through her, all the way to the tug of Rio’s mouth around her nipple, sucking, insistent, devastating. Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes fluttering back, mouth falling open as helpless sounds spilled out of her. Every part of her tightened, clenched, like her body was bracing for something it couldn’t hold back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's fingers traced agonizingly slow circles just where Agatha needed her most, drawing out a choked gasp. "God, you're- " Agatha's words dissolved into a moan as Rio's thumb pressed down harder, her other hand pinning Agatha's hip to the mattress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Say it ," Rio murmured against the damp skin of Agatha's throat, her breath scalding. "I want to hear you scream my name when you're falling apart."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, no. Not happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha might’ve been half feral with need, strung out and shaking, but she wasn’t giving Rio that kind of satisfaction</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's nails scored down Rio's bare back. "Bastard," she panted, even as her hips lifted desperately into Rio's touch. The contradiction made Rio laugh, low, breathless, maddening. It vibrated against Agatha’s throat like a second pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you’re so close,” Rio whispered, voice dark and dripping with smug satisfaction. Her fingers didn’t stop, not for a second. “And still trying to win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growled something unintelligible, half a curse, half a gasp, but her body betrayed her, hips lifting, muscles tensing, already giving in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, the sound sinfully pleased. “Still holding out on me? Even now?” She dipped lower, her mouth brushing the edge of Agatha’s jaw, teeth grazing skin. “You’re shaking, panting, soaking my fingers, and you still won’t say it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her thumb down again, just right, just enough, and Agatha nearly cried out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could keep you right here forever,” Rio murmured, her voice a molten thread in Agatha’s ear. “Right on the edge. Begging. Cursing me while you fall apart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her free hand slipped up to cup Agatha’s breast, fingers toying lazily with her nipple, her voice dropping lower. “But I’d rather hear you lose control. I want to feel you break when you say my name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tilted her head, lips brushing the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Look at you," Rio growled, her voice thick with hunger and something darker. She watched the way Agatha’s body arched beneath her, taut and trembling, strung like a drawn bowstring. “All that control, gone. Just for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her teeth grazed Agatha’s collarbone, a fleeting bite just shy of bruising, as her rhythm turned brutal, precise and merciless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words should have pissed Agatha off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, they sent white hot electricity down her spine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>White hot electricity shot down her spine, her whole body tightening around the sheer gravity of Rio’s voice, her touch, her claims. Every sharp edged compliment, every possessive murmur it didn’t cage her. It ignited her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never felt this aware of herself. Of every beat of her heart thudding behind her knees, every tremble in her thighs, every sharp intake of breath that couldn’t seem to make it all the way to her lungs. Her body wasn’t her own anymore, it belonged to sensation, to Rio, to the fire licking through her with every maddening stroke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every twitch of overstimulated nerves felt like kindling, spark after spark feeding the blaze Rio had been building in her chest from the moment she first laid a hand on her. And now it was roaring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Knew you’d be like this,” Rio rasped, her mouth dragging lower, her voice frayed and hungry. “Knew you’d burn so pretty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned, half in protest, half in surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips brushed her ear as her fingers moved with devastating precision. “So go on,” she whispered, the words curling like smoke through Agatha’s brain. “Ruin yourself for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That did it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Those words, low, reverent, wicked, were the final push.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The release crashed into her, sharp and sudden, tearing through her like a live wire. Agatha’s body tensed, her spine arching off the bed, mouth open in a cry that was half-voiced, half-silent, high, helpless, and </span>
<em>
<span>hers</span>
</em>
<span>. Her fingers dug into Rio’s shoulders, scrabbling for something, anything, to hold onto as the wave hit. It was violent in its intensity, raw heat snapping through her like lightning, pleasure so consuming it left her breathless, broken open. She couldn’t hold it in. She didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to. She just let go, and shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke apart, gloriously, in Rio’s hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed the sound of Agatha’s unraveling in a kiss. Her lips were soft, but her hands stayed firm, holding Agatha through the shaking aftershocks, like she’d planned to catch her from the beginning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped against her mouth, one hand sliding into Rio’s hair, not to take control, but to hold on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she wasn’t sure what would happen if she let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was still catching her breath, chest rising and falling in uneven waves, her body limp and trembling beneath the remnants of pleasure that rippled through her like aftershocks. Her eyes fluttered open, hazy and unfocused, locking on Rio’s face above her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked wrecked, in the best way. Her lips were kiss swollen, her hair a mess from Agatha’s fists, her skin flushed with effort and heat. But her expression? That was what undid Agatha all over again. There was no gloating in her eyes, no smugness. Just awe. Something soft, something terrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, brushing her nose along Agatha’s cheek, letting their skin touch again, bare, gentle, grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did so good for me,” she murmured, her voice a low hum of praise that curled into Agatha’s stomach. “So fucking good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shivered, the words wrapping around her like silk and steel all at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio’s lips curved into that slow, hungry smile, the one that always meant trouble. She shifted just enough to press a kiss to the center of Agatha’s chest, right above her hammering heart, and then lower, lingering just beneath the curve of a breast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not done with you,” she said softly, almost conversationally, like it was a simple truth. “Not even close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to process before Rio’s mouth ghosted lower again, her hands sliding down Agatha’s sides, grounding and possessive all at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to taste you,” Rio whispered, the words so quiet they barely touched the air, but Agatha felt them like a jolt, low and deep and dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tensed beneath her, not in fear, but in sheer, visceral anticipation. Her breath hitched again, her fingers instinctively clutching at Rio’s biceps, holding on like she was afraid the ground might drop out from under her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her mouth, maybe to say something, she didn’t know what. A protest, a deflection, anything to break the tension curling tight in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she looked at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the way her mouth was slightly parted, her eyes dark and heavy lidded but clear. At the way she wasn’t pushing, wasn’t demanding, just waiting, patient, steady, hers for now. Her hair wild, her breath still ragged, her body wrapped around Agatha like worship.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the doubt disintegrated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course she wanted this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse thundered in her ears, and something inside her gave in, let go, opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled, slow and shaky, but her voice was steady when she finally spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she whispered, her gaze flicking from Rio’s eyes to her lips and back again. “Fuck it. Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, slow, wicked, and impossibly fond all at once. “Good,” she murmured, already lowering herself again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned, loud and unrestrained, as her tongue dragged a hot, messy line down Agatha’s ribs and across the plane of her stomach. The trail of wet heat turned cool in its wake, raising goosebumps along Agatha’s skin. She shivered, hips jolting when Rio dipped her head lower, hovering at the curve of her belly, and let a long, deliberate strand of spit fall into the dip just above her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, eyes wide, watching as Rio dragged her fingertips through the slick mess, slow and unbothered, pushing it upward, smearing it in slow, swirling strokes over Agatha’s breasts, circling her nipples with both hands. Her palms moved like she was sculpting something precious, coaxing another tremor from Agatha as she shimmed lower still, mouth following the path she’d made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her, barely able to breathe, the sight alone enough to make her dizzy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Settled between her thighs, Rio looked up, lips hovering just above where Agatha needed her most. Her breath caught in her throat. That look in Rio’s eyes, dark, reverent, hungry, unraveled her completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to speak, to say something, but only a fractured, breathy sound escaped as Rio finally lowered her mouth, warm and sure, tongue dragging a slow, deliberate lick up her center.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, heat. A deep, languid suck that stole the air from Agatha’s lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulsed hard, a fresh wave of need surging through her, her hands fisting in the sheets. The wet sound of Rio pulling off, low, obscene, followed by the sharp kiss of suction, made her jerk, a moan breaking free as her hips trembled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, lips brushing against slick skin. “So needy,” she murmured, low and smug, like she already knew exactly how far Agatha would fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lost vision, eyes rolling up as Rio kissed her swollen, sensitive skin.  Soft, puckering, pressed so warm there. Kissed again. And again. And again,</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hot breath ghosted over her, a whisper of heat that made Agatha twitch. Then, her tongue pressed between swollen folds, dragging upward in a slow, molten sweep that made Agatha’s thighs quiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio’s mouth sealed over her, deep, all consuming. Her nose pressed into Agatha’s skin, her breath ragged and warm as her tongue circled, licked, and stroked around her clit with devastating focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heat of her tongue, the pressure of those rhythmic, sucking kisses, it shot through Agatha’s body in a fierce, tight wave, pleasure pulsing hard and insistent, building behind her ribs, low in her belly, pushing back against every wet motion of Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned, breath snagging in her throat. “F-fuck…” she gasped, barely able to hold on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s tongue circled her clit again, slow, wide, deliberate, and Agatha's unraveling deepened, her body jolting in response. Her hips bucked, legs tensing like a wire pulled too tight, ready to snap. Her breath came in ragged, open, mouthed gasps, each one sharper than the last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it wasn’t just the sharp, electric pulses radiating from where Rio touched her anymore, it had sunk deeper. A low, twisting ache had bloomed inside her, throbbing with such intensity she could barely stand it. It built with every breath, every flick of Rio’s tongue, so overwhelming she thought, she might cry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sealed her mouth over her, drawing Agatha’s folds into a deep, molten suck that lingered, slow, consuming. When she finally pulled back, the release came with a soft, wet pop that sent Agatha’s clit twitching in the open air. Rio licked her lips with obscene satisfaction, her eyes dark and heavy lidded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cried out, the sound raw and broken, blending with the wet, unrelenting rhythm of Rio’s mouth. And then, Rio moaned. Low, guttural, wrecked, before devouring her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound hit Agatha like a punch to the chest, thick, warm, and spreading fast, heat unfurling in waves through her limbs. Her body clenched instinctively, slick spilling from her in response, her hips rolling helplessly toward the sound, the feeling, her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down, breath stuttering at the sight of Rio, cheeks flushed, eyes closed in concentration, half hanging off the bed like she couldn’t care about anything but this. But her. Rio’s moans were low and strained, thick with heat almost undone herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she looked up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eyes glittering, dark and hungry, mouth still full, lips slick and shining, and watching her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sight alone unraveled Agatha again. Her clit throbbed beneath the relentless attention of Rio’s tongue, the pressure searing, exquisite. It ripped through her in a single, blinding wave, limbs trembling, hips jerking off the bed, her back arching high as her second orgasm snapped through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She might have screamed, she wasn’t sure. Everything blurred, her senses white hot as her clit throbbed in sharp, relentless pulses. The bed trembled beneath her, her body seized in the grip of release so deep it felt like something inside her had broken open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pleasure flooded through her, hot and overwhelming. She gushed, soaking Rio’s mouth, her chin, even the sheets beneath them. Her thighs trembled violently as she clenched around nothing, desperate and unmoored, riding the crashing waves as they tore through her, wave after wave, shuddering and unstoppable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thighs clamped tight around Rio’s head, trembling uncontrollably as her body convulsed. She was shaking so hard her vision blurred, the edges darkening with the sheer force of it. She couldn’t stop, could barely breathe, each gasp ragged and desperate as she reached for Rio, fingers tangling in her dark, sweat damp hair, holding on like it was the only thing keeping her grounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned again, low and reverent, kissing the oversensitive, heat flushed skin with slow, worshipful slurps. Her mouth was soft, wet, insatiable, still tasting, still wanting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every kiss made Agatha twitch, made her throb, the echoes of pleasure still pulsing deep inside her. The aftershocks rolled through her in waves, too intense, too much, and yet not enough. She couldn’t stop crying, didn’t even realize she was until tears slipped down her cheeks, mingling with sweat, with gasping breaths and quiet, broken sounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gulped at the air, whining, keening, her voice hoarse and wrecked. “I – fuck –”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know if she was breathing or crying or just falling apart, her chest heaved, her limbs refused to stop shaking, and Rio’s breath was still warm against her skin. </span>
</p><p>
