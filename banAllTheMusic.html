<div class="userstuff">
<p>At the request, Rio Vidal finds herself genuinely considering it. She hadn't had anything like this before, her work usually being limited to doing a one time cook for a party or some sort of celebration. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had never felt the appeal for going to someone's house, cooking meals for them on the regular, and actually <em>getting to know them.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But, despite that, when she recieves an email from Agatha Harkness, she does find herself genuinely considering it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The email was layed out politely, professionally. Rio could have sworn she's heard the name somewhere, so before doing anything, she gives her a quick google.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As it turns out, she's been in the news a few times following some incredible work at her company, which she's the CEO. And as Rio had expected, she's fucking rich. Also kinda hot, but Rio wouldn't admit that as part of the reason for the consideration.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Like, she'd be able to afford Rio cooking for her for every meal of every day for a whole ten years if she so desired, type of rich. And Rio isn't cheap. She's really fucking good at her job, getting paid to do what she loves. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The highest viewed news article is what gets Rio's attention. It had been posted around two months ago, with a photo at the top of Agatha and another woman together. She scrolls through it, discovering that said woman is Agatha's now <em>ex-wife</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's gay. How the fuck could this get any worse for Rio?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She thinks about it for a good few hours, taking the time to weigh up the options. As uncomfortable as it could be working for a recently divorced lesbian, that recently divorced lesbian is <em>rich and fucking attractive.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, before doing anything that could be stupid, she calls Alice, her longest friend, and an exceptional chef she met in her first kitchen. It rings three times before there's an answer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Help." Is the first thing Rio says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Hello to you too, Rio. I'm doing so good, thanks for asking, Rio."</em> Alice jokes. <em>"What?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, hypothetically, if you had decided years ago that you never wanted to do any long-term work for anyone, but then some hot rich MILF emails you asking you to cook for her, what would you do?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Hold on. Let me get this straight—"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Alice help." Rio groans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"—you're seriously considering turning down a hot rich MILF?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know!" Rio leans back into the sofa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Who's the hot rich MILF?</em>" Alice asks, and Rio can absolutely hear the smirk on her face over the phone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha Harkness."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Agatha Harkness?! She wants you to— okay, here's my advice: do it."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Should I?" Rio sighs, biting at her lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Yes! She's rich. And insanely attractive. Plus, it might be nice to get to know some more people."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you calling me lonely?" Rio fakes offence, gasping overdramatically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Yes. Now go accept that fucking offer."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head with a laugh, "Okay. Fine." And hangs up the phone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio absolutely emails <em>Agatha Harkness</em> back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>From:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e3c6038272a2f220e213b3a22212125602d2123" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>To:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="365e57445d18575157425e57765e575a425218594451" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Job Offer?</p><p> </p><p>Hi Miss Harkness,</p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your email, I am very interested in taking you up on your offer.</p><p> </p><p>How about we meet in person to discuss the details further?</p><p> </p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Rio Vidal</p><p> </p><p>

<em>1:28pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>There</em>, Rio thinks. Professional, to the point. She definitely didn't suggest meeting in person to see Agatha up close. Definitely not.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Besides, Agatha's just gotten out of a twelve year marriage, she's probably fucking devastated, and she probably isn't—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's phone buzzes in her hand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Okay, no—</em> there's no way Agatha's responded already. <em>Right?</em> She's probably working or something.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nevermind. Clearly Agatha Harkness has nothing better to do than reply to Rio's email less than five minutes later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>From:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="afc7ceddc481cec8cedbc7ceefc7cec3dbcb81c0ddc8" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>To:</strong> <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0a78247c636e6b664a657f7e6665656124696567" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Job Offer?</p><p> </p><p>Afternoon, Miss Vidal,</p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much for your consideration, I really appreciate it.</p><p> </p><p>I'd love to discuss further - what do you say we meet at Greenroot's tomorrow at midday?</p><p> </p><p>Best,</p><p>Agatha</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 6, 2025</em>
</p><p>
<em>1:32pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods to herself, then just puts her phone down instead of replying right away. She absolutely is going to say yes to meeting Agatha, and she's probably going to end up accepting the job.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Alice is right— maybe she <em>should</em> have more friends. Even if that friend is a hot rich MILF that she would definitely consider fucking if it weren't for the fact she's just left her ex-wife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>At least she's gay,</em> Rio shrugs. Maybe she'd have some sort of chance after Agatha's gotten over her failed marriage.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio picks up her phone again. <em>Not</em> to reply to Agatha, no. To google her a <em>little</em> more, which, arguably is a little worse than seeming desperate to get the job, but it kind of makes sense in Rio's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finds a few articles online, and takes the time to learn a little more about her potential client. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio learns that Agatha's fourty-five, works in finance, but specifically, she does charity work. She organises events, a couple of which Rio's actually catered for herself. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reads that Agatha had gotten to the top all on her own, zero help from her parents. It becomes clear that there's actually <em>nothing</em> about her parents, and when Agatha's been spoken to in interviews, she refuses to talk about them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio even finds a couple of her interviews and watches them. Agatha has a kid, Nicky, who is eight years old. She loves to talk about him, her face just lighting up when she's asked about him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There's always tension when Agatha's asked about her now ex-wife, and she flat out refuses to talk about anything to do with her parents.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hold on. What the fuck is Rio doing? Agatha's clearly beautiful, Rio can absolutely see why anyone would want to marry her. But she's literally meeting her tomorrow, why is she scrolling through YouTube?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sighs and throws her phone back onto the sofa after setting herself a rule: Do <em>not</em> fuck Agatha Harkness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not yet, at least.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stands up from her sofa and wanders over to the kitchen, grabbing a watering can before heading outside to her greenhouse.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She grows the majority of her own produce, mainly vegetables, and anything else she buys on the day she cooks. But most of all, she likes plants, and she likes growing things.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's exactly what got Rio into cooking in the first place. Back in Puerto Rico, she lived with her abuela, who had her own greenhouse, just like Rio's now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio was younger, she would obsess over the plants, and her abuela let her grow her own things in the corner of her greenhouse. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, Rio's abuela would show her recipes, her own signature dishes that absolutely enamoured Rio. As she grew older, she learned to cook herself, create her own dishes and eventually got herself a job in a kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The greenhouse relaxes Rio. So she decides that's a good time to reply to Agatha's email and agree to meeting up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Alice does not shut up about it. She texts Rio that morning, practically begging her to tell her everything that happens. Rio isn't quite sure why Alice is so invested in this.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio gets to Greenroot's a few minutes before midday, she sees Agatha already inside. She takes a deep breath before going inside and walking over to her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's on her phone, chewing at her lip with what Rio could only assume is nervousness. Rio pauses infront of her and says, "Miss Harkness?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha jolts her head up, putting her phone face down on the table, and offering Rio a smile, "You must be Rio." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Rio nods, then gestures to the seat opposite Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please," She smiles, "go ahead."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's lovely to meet you, Miss Harkness." Rio says. She leans back against the chair comfortably, but she can't stop her leg from shaking underneath the table. Fuck, Agatha is so much more stunning in person.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you." Agatha says, before sighing and glancing at the table, then looking up at Rio again. "Do you mind if we just get straight into it? I'm not brilliant with small talk."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh— no, of course. I—I do have a few questions for you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha's eyebrows raise a little out of their own accord as she sits up slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure you know I won't be able to work every single night, but I can cook however much you'll need. Do you..have an idea of when you'd want me?" God, Rio phrased it awfully, but thankfully Agatha gets her point.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was hoping maybe two days a week? I know you're probably very busy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Two days a week would work." Rio says quickly. "Uh..I—I don't want to sound too blunt but do you have an idea of the pay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever you want— <em>need."</em> Agatha quickly corrects herself. "I can do hundred and fifty an hour?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's mouth falls open, blinking a few times before stammering, "I—..that's a lot."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The offer still stands." Agatha shrugs. "Did you want anything to eat or drink, by the way?" She quickly adds, already standing up to get something for herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"S—sure." Rio blurts out, "Yeah."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Holy shit, what the hell was Rio getting herself into?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What'd you like?" Agatha asks, taking a couple steps back to get a headstart at the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio catches herself biting her lip, before stopping herself and saying, "Coffee and a croissant, if it's not too much trouble?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course." Agatha nods and continues her journey over to the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio simply watches, watches the <em>gorgeous</em> woman who just offered to pay her <em>five times</em> her usual pay. She watches the way Agatha moves, her gestures when she says a brief few words to the cashier, and the way she takes slower, gentler steps when walking back to the table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." Rio says sincerely, taking the croissant and coffee from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, it's nothing." Agatha shakes her head, waving her hand dismissively.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Listen, about the money, Miss Harkness.." Rio trails off, awkwardly looking over at Agatha as she sits down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, if you <em>want</em> me to pay you less, I will." She says, "I just—.." Rio catches the way Agatha's jaw tightens. "I need this. The..the help."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods along, ripping a few bite-sized pieces off of her croissant and placing them in her mouth. She decides she must be making shit up when she thinks she saw Agatha's gaze follow Rio's hands up to her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And I know you're good. Or— from what I've heard." She huffs a laugh. "Right now, cooking is just..a lot. Anything is, really, but.." She cuts her sentence short with a shrug. And when she looks back up at Rio it's like a mask slips on. "And, please, call me Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Agatha." Rio says, nodding. "Hundred and fifty."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sounds good." Agatha smiles, then asks hopefully, "Is this you agreeing to the job?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods her head, "I'd say so, yeah. When..when do you want me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhales sharply, catching her bottom lip between her teeth before running a hand through her hair and saying, "When works best for you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whenever, just not Thursday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tuesday and Friday?" Agatha suggests. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Want me to start this Friday?" Rio asks, taking another bite of her croissant.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If you don't mind." Agatha says, picking up her phone, then pushing it across the table with her contacts open. "Here, give me your number."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just stares at her wide-eyed, but still reaches over to tap her number into Agatha's phone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not like <em>that</em>, idiot," She clears her throat before adding under her breath, "not that I'd be opposed."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fuck, is Agatha seriously <em>flirting with her?</em> Rio exhales sharply, simply pretending she hadn't heard anything. She had just gotten divorced for fuck's sake.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio passes Agatha's phone back to her as she asks, "So, uh..what sort of food are you wanting?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, whatever's easiest for you, really." Agatha says, and Rio can almost hear the compassion in her tone. "As long as there's no mushrooms, I can <em>not</em> eat mushrooms."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles lightly, "And here I was planning to serve you mushrooms every night." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It earns Rio a laugh, and Agatha tilts her head to the side a little, "Glad I chose you out of the others. I think we'll get along just fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, they just look at eachother, Agatha's eyes narrow as she smiles genuinely sweetly at Rio, and Rio's sure it's obvious how hot and bothered she is.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An abrupt ringing of a phone brings them both back to reality. Agatha laughs awkwardly and checks who it is, "Shit, sorry— I need to get going."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Thank you for the.." She gestures to the coffee.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're very welcome, Rio." She stands up, "I'll text you my address, and see you Friday?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. See you Friday." When Agatha's out of her sight, she releases a breath she hadn't realised she was even holding. She opens her phone to update Alice, but sees a message from an unknown number.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It becomes clear very quickly that it's Agatha, having sent Rio her address and ending the message with a single x. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio immediately finds Alice's number, seeing three messages from her already.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

<p>Before Rio knows it, it's Friday and she's driving to Agatha's house. It's a large house, must have been worth millions, and Rio parks just on the road outside.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She grabs her tote bag from the passenger seat with all her ingredients inside, and gets out of the car.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's chosen to wear a pair of wide leg, low rise jeans, complimenting the chunky boots she's wearing. She has a white sleeveless vest on, which may have been a little bold, but it's too late now. Upon leaving the house, she had grabbed her leather bomber jacket from it's coat hook, slipping it on and adjusting her necklace. She's wearing a few rings, and her hair is freshly washed and wavy. Anyone <em>smart</em> in the street would be able to recognise that she's a lesbian.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she knocks on Agatha's door, she realises how nervous she is. Partly because she's never had this sort of job before, and partly because <em>fuck</em>, Agatha's the most beautiful woman she's ever seen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The door opens infront of her, revealing Agatha, who has a smile plastered on her face. She's wearing what Rio can only assume was her work attire— a maroon blazer with black trousers and a white button-up shirt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her blankly for a moment before huffing a laugh and stepping to the side to allow Rio entry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You have a very lovely home." Rio comments, kneeling down to untie her shoes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." She smiles, then runs a hand through her hair. "I'll show you to the kitchen." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stands up and places her shoes on the shoe rack, then follows Agatha's lead through the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Pots and pans are in here," She taps a few cupboards, running Rio through where everything is, "plates are in here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks." Rio smiles softly, casually shrugging her jacket off. She does <em>not</em> miss the way freshly divorced Agatha Harkness looks over her exposed arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The way her tongue darts out to wet her lips before she says, "Here, let me take that for you." And takes the jacket and walks off without another word.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites at her lip when Agatha's left, then settles on grabbing the ingredients from her tote bag and taking a chopping board from one of the cupboards.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, what's for dinner, chef?" Agatha asks from behind her with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thought I'd start relatively simple. How do you like your steak by the way?" Rio replies, turning around briefly to find Agatha sat on the counter behind her, now missing the maroon blazer, leaving her in the white button-up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wow, it's my lucky day." She chuckles lightly, "Medium rare." Agatha adds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Great, okay. Should be about an hour or so— gotta sort out the veg." She gestures vaguely with her hands. "You can go relax."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Would you mind if I stayed here?" Agatha asks, tapping her fingers on the edge of the cupboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..no, not at all." Rio shakes her head with a laugh, "I don't usually <em>perform."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, "Gives me something to do. Besides, you're pleasant to look at."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches, and she focuses on peeling and dicing the carrots. She pretends she hadn't heard it at all, but it becomes increasingly hard to focus when she hears Agatha hop down from her place on the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of Rio's eye, she can see Agatha settle a few steps away from her, leaning with her back against the counter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want a glass of wine?" Agatha asks, turning to grab a glass out of a cupboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She glances at Agatha and smiles briefly, "Sure. Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slides the now half-filled wine glass over to Rio, tapping the pads of her fingers over the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By now, Rio's moved on to preparing some green beans, cutting of the tops and bottoms of them. She pauses for a second to have a sip of wine, and has to stop herself from moaning at how nice it is. It even <em>tastes</em> expensive.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not that I don't enjoy the company," Rio utters, "but don't you have important CEO stuff to be doing?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles and lifts herself up onto the counter beside Rio, "I make a very pointed effort to keep my work <em>in</em> work." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums, "Is it not hard to do that with your work?" She then adds, "Sorry— I don't mean to pry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you can pry as much as you like, sugar." Agatha waves her hand around infront of her before actually answering her question, "It's easier than you'd think. I mainly just give orders, organise events. I rarely even have the last call on money that goes out."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I always thought you'd have to work twelve hours a day." Rio shrugs, shifting her weight slightly to grab a potato. She tries <em>very</em> hard not to dwell on the pet name, paired with the growing heat between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What about you?" Agatha asks, gesturing at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio glances at her just quick enough to catch Agatha biting at her nails, watching Rio chop up the potato into chip-sized pieces. "I don't usually do..this." She says, signalling around the room with her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No?" Curiosity peaks through Agatha's otherwise indistinguishable tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"First time." Rio adds, "I usually do random parties, events, that sort of thing. I'm hardly in the kichen anymore." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you miss it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If this was any other situation in any other place, where Rio wasn't <em>working</em>, she'd assume this is a date. "Sometimes," She says instead, "but the freedom I've got now is nice."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods along as Rio's talking, her feet slightly kicking the cupboard doors. "Have you been a chef for a while?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio glances at her again, and for a moment she thinks if Agatha actually needs a private chef in the first place with the way she's looking at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I mean you're, what, early twenties? You can't have been doing this long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thirties." Rio sighs with a smile. "I'm thirty-two."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Jesus." Agatha huffs a laugh, a sudden wash of..<em>relief?</em> over her face, "But, go on."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My abuela taught me to cook when I was young. I lived in Puerto Rico my whole childhood, and when I moved here I started working."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, your whole life?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. But I like it, you know?" Rio shrugs, moving the chopped up potatoes to one side and picking up the steak, laying it on the chopping board.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The conversation dies down, leaving Rio to rub in some herbs into the steak and pretend she can't feel Agatha's eyes on her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a moment to think things through. Agatha was married for over a decade. She has a son. There's no fucking way that Agatha's actually <em>really</em> interested if it isn't purely for sex. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't do that. If she wants someone, she wants <em>all</em> of them. The sex sure, but she'd want the nights laying together in bed, watching TV, going out for dinner.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She suspects Agatha just wants sex. It's been about two months since her divorce, according to the media, so unless their love died long before that, why would Agatha be pursuing anyone if it wasn't for sex?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows she's attractive. Of course she does. It's part of the reason she had honestly dressed up a little knowing she'd see Agatha. She enjoys seeing the effect she has on people, even if she isn't planning to do anything about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But the way Agatha's looking at her is really making her doubt her own rules. The way her breath hitches as she watches Rio work the steak. The way she licks her lips, the way she insists to keep her company.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're good with your hands."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Okay, is Rio fucking imagining things? She turns to Agatha with her mouth open, and judging by the smirk playing on her lips, she hadn't imagined a thing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—..tha—thank you." Rio stammers, looking away before she can see Agatha grin wider.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's about to say something else undoubtedly flirty, but the ringing of a phone a few feet away brings her to a stiff pause.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio continues with the meat while she hears Agatha hop off of the counter again and grab her phone. She answers it with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want, Wanda?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The ex-wife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And the sudden bite in her tone almost makes Rio flinch, it's <em>nothing</em> like how Agatha's been talking to <em>her</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio makes an effort to quiet down a little, just so she can get even a small inkling of their current relationship— Nope, nevermind. Agatha leaves the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Except, if Rio drops absolutely everything she's doing, she can still make out her voice a little. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—don't give a shit what— we had a fucking <em>deal</em>, Wanda."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can hear the sounds of Agatha pacing through the hallway, and the occasional thud against the wall. Rio assumes it's just Agatha dropping her head against it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, <em>you're</em> supposed to be the one that— you want me to read you the fucking paperwork?" Agatha's voice gets a little quieter, and Rio guesses it's that she walks a little too far out of reach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sighs, unable to stop herself from feeling a little concerned. <em>Why?</em> Rio has no idea. Not one. Okay, maybe except for the fact that Agatha was blatantly flirting with her and now she's on the phone with her ex-wife.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't jealous. She doesn't <em>get</em> jealous. No. So why is this bothering her so much? It could be the fact that Agatha's smile might be the most gorgeous thing she's ever—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, I'll send you a couple hundred. For Nicky. But that is <em>it</em> this month." Agatha's voice becomes clearer again, just before it goes silent outside. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There's a beat before Agatha returns, and when Rio briefly turns around, she forgets how to breathe for a moment. She's wearing fucking glasses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—Is everything okay?" Rio practically chokes the words out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha decides to just ignore her question and ask one of her own, "Would you want to stay?" And when Rio just turns back around with her eyes wide, she huffs a laugh, "For dinner. It's not— I.." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a second, the mask slips, but Rio sees the exact moment it's fit back onto her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not trying to get in your pants." Agatha shakes her head with a slightly amused smile, an obvious lie in the phrase.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio finds that she wouldn't actually be opposed. No, yes she would. She has fucking rules. Her <em>do not fuck Agatha Harkness</em> rule, which is getting extremely close to breaking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I could just do with the company. A—and I wouldn't want all this produce to go to waste," She motions towards the vegetables with her hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I—I can stay." Rio speaks quickly, her mind busy trying to figure out why Agatha actually <em>wanted</em> her to stay. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha's face lights up a little, "I can pay extra if—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't ask you to do that," Rio dismisses her quickly, "you're already doing <em>much</em> more than you need to."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?" Agatha's brows furrow, biting her bottom lip, and <em>God</em>, if it isn't the cutest thing Rio's ever—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Positive." Rio forces out, trying so hard to rid her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly decides that it's best to just change the subject. To be safer, she also turns around so she stops thinking about Agatha in those glasses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I actually grow all the..the stuff myself." She eventually blurts out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah?" Agatha hums, returning to her spot on the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I mean not the meat, obviously, but I have a—a greenhouse."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You'll have to show me sometime." Agatha says, and it seems to surprise her too when she suddenly sucks in a sharp breath and says, "I—I'll go lay the table."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Approximately thirty minutes later, Rio meets Agatha in the dining room and hands a plate of food to her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This smells really good," Agatha says, cutting into her steak, "and it's cooked perfectly."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, "There's a reason people say I'm the best."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There certainly is." She takes a bite of the steak, and practically moans, <em>"Fuck</em>, this is so good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's jaw tightens for a moment and she presses her thighs together in an attempt to supress the heat in her stomach. "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know, I was so used to these store bought meals that I.." She trails off, shaking her head. "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For what?" Rio asks, "I'm just doing my job."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Exactly— thank you for doing your job." She says, raising her eyebrows for a moment, "For..for accepting my offer."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After they've eaten, Agatha insists that she helps clear up, despite it literally being part of Rio's job. They fall into the type of routine that gets perfected after being married for twenty years. Rio doesn't hate it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Leaving Agatha's house becomes awkward. There's an obvious attraction between the two of them, one that they've both noticed. The way Agatha looks at her, the things she says, and the way Rio reacts. The stammering, the way her lips part automatically when she looks at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio swears she feels ten times hotter when Agatha's hand brushes hers when she passes Rio her jacket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So..I'll see you on Tuesday?" Agatha says, hopeful despite already having made the agreement.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tuesday." Rio parrots, slipping her coat on and stepping out of the way to allow Agatha to open the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Have a good weekend, Rio." She briefly places her hand on Rio's arm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ten times hotter. Rio needs to crawl out of her skin and sit in an ice bath. "You too." She says, her voice somehow steady, "Text me if you have any requests for Tuesday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Thank you." She nods, a smile spreading over her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're welcome. Good night, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Night." Agatha breathes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The door closes, leaving Rio alone in the chill of the night. Maybe she should rethink her rule. Maybe she should properly flirt back, make it clear she's properly interested.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But then, what if Agatha isn't? Rio doesn't do just sex. But then again...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>It'd probably be one hell of a one-night stand.</em>

<p>It's a cold Tuesday morning. Agatha had worked for about an hour before she was due to have her appointment, too caught up in wanting to distract herself from it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It only really hits her when she gets out of her car and shuts the door behind her, when she feels the cold January air nipping at the skin on her hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Closing her eyes for a moment, she takes a breath before walking over to the building and walking into the warmth of it. Not the good warmth, though, the uncomfortable kind that makes her want to rip her skin off. But maybe that's just because she's nervous.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sits in the waiting room, her leg bouncing a little. The anticipation is fucking killing her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When her name is called, her head jolts up, almost pulling a muscle in her neck in the process. She stands up, straightening her coat before following her therapist into his office.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How has this week been, Agatha?" Dr Gray asks, sitting opposite her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I.. hired a private chef." She says quietly, clasping her hands tightly in her lap, interlocking her fingers together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He nods, "And how is that going?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good. I—I'm actually eating properly, now, so." Agatha shrugs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's good progress." He then studies the look on Agatha's face, frowning, "Is there more?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites back a smile, eventually deciding to ask, "How..how long after a divorce is it okay to start dating again?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, are you saying you want to date the chef?" Dr Gray asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I..I don't know. But I like her. She's pretty, and I've been flirting."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sounds like you want to date her." He comments, then frowns again, "But you seem..upset. Is it not a good thing?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's what I'm not sure about." Agatha says. "I don't want to rush things, and then scare Nicky away more than he already is."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We've talked about this, Agatha, Nicky isn't scared away."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The only time he spends with me is every other weekend." Agatha reminds him, sighing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because that's the price Wanda <em>made you</em> pay. It was <em>Wanda's</em> choice, not Nicky's." Her therapist explains, gently. "But, Agatha, that doesn't mean he's scared. Why would he be scared?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Scared isn't the right word." Agatha looks down at the floor and her eyebrows pull together, "More...worried. Confused. He wants me to have all the answers, why his moms aren't living together anymore."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And <em>do</em> you have the answers?" Dr Gray presses gently, his pen scratching over the paper on his notebook.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Simple. Wanda and I fell out of love <em>years</em> before the divorce. Drifted apart. But I can't say that to him— I—I can't crush him like that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's understandable."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What we had was..good," Agatha continues, "really good, but then it just..fell apart, and—" Her words get caught in her throat. "We just wanted to be there for Nicky, we wanted to fix things for <em>him</em>, but then of course— of course Wanda went and fucked her boss. I couldn't— couldn't do it anymore."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And that's when you got a divorce? After you found out she was cheating?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods, cracking her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you miss anything about your marriage, Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—...the things at the start." She says, then frowns, "Well, I suppose we weren't— getting married ruined us. It was good <em>before</em> we were married."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And after you were married? What was the relationship like?" Dr Gray treads lightly. Agatha hasn't spoken much about this, he knows it's a sensitive topic.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat. "It— she didn't really...care about me. It was always what <em>she</em> wanted and what <em>she—"</em> She stops herself, "Well, except for Nicky. He was... what I wanted." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He nods slowly, taking a note of the way Agatha's voice had begun shaking a little, the way she had avoided <em>something</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Carefully, he pushes just a little more. "And...did Wanda have that same attitude when you were intimate with her?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not today." Agatha murmurs, fiddling with the edges of her sleeves, "I don't— don't want to talk about that today."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dr Gray nods. He notes a few things down about Agatha's tone, her body language, the words themselves. But he doesn't push any further— doesn't cross Agatha's boundries.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, what was <em>good</em> before you were married?" He asks, then specifies, "What are you wanting now?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just..being with someone, holding someone, being— being held. It made me feel..safe."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And do you think that's a possibility with your chef?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh, "I don't know. Maybe? She's nice and she cares and I—...I guess I just want someone that cares."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's her name?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The session lasts for an hour, but it of course feels longer, and Agatha tells Dr Gray a little about Rio. At four in the afternoon that day, she's sat on her sofa, still wearing her work clothes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The doorbell rings. Rio shouldn't be here for another hour— <em>is she here early?</em> Agatha's heart jumps a little at the thought. She stands up and strolls to the door, unlocking and opening it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's met by the last person she wants to see. Wanda fucking Maximoff. Agatha just stares at her for a moment until—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama!" Nicky steps out from behind Wanda's legs and tightly wraps his arms around Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi, sweetheart." She kneels down to greet him properly and ruffles his hair. "I wasn't expecting you today." She adds, taking a firm look at Wanda.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's an emergency." Wanda says. "I need you to have him tonight."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A little notice would have been nice." Agatha sighs, standing up and pulling Nicky into her arms, lifting him up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda just shrugs, then pulls Nicky's attention to her, "You be good, okay? I'll come and get you tomorrow."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Nicky nods, "Bye Mommy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuts the door before Nicky has a chance to answer, but thankfully he doesn't seem to notice the malice behind it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You wanna watch some TV?" Agatha asks, walking him over to the sofa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes!" He smiles and willingly sits beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wraps an arm around his shoulders, while the other reaches for her phone and opens Rio's contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 14, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>agatha: So fucking sorry for the short notice but is there any chance you can cook something tolerable to a 8 year old tonight?</p><p>
<em>4:12pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Why the fuck did it have to be tonight? Agatha was seriously considering asking Rio on a real date this time. Her phone buzzes in her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: yeah ofc, i'll be over in twenty</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha: Yes, that would be great. Thank you x</p><p>
<em>4:15pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha: You text like a teenager</p><p>
<em>4:16pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: and you text like a grandma</p><p>
<em>4:16pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles lightly, then places her phone back down on the arm of the sofa. Fuck, she's down bad.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The doorbell rings less than fifteen minutes later, and Agatha gets up to open the door. Tonight, Rio's wearing the same pair of jeans and jacket, but a green checkered flannel rather than the vest that had looked so insanely good.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi." Agatha smiles, then moves to let her in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You look..tired." Rio says, and Agatha almost misses the concerned flash in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Long day." She murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They both look down to the origin of the voice, the boy clinging to Agatha's legs, looking right up at Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hello there, chiquito. My name's Rio, I cook for your mom." She crouches down and holds her hand out for him to shake. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He grabs her hand with both of his, shaking vigorously. "Hi Miss Rio! I'm Nicky! What's for dinner?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well," Rio starts, "it's a surprise, but it'll be ready at about six." She then turns to Agatha, "Is that okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, yeah. Okay." Agatha nods, hardly having listened to anything Rio said. God, of course she's good with kids, too.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha?" Rio brings her out of her little daydream, pointing backwards to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, she turns to Nicky, "Hey, go watch some more TV, I'll be there in a second."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay Mama." Agatha hopes she can keep him being easy his whole life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you alright?" Rio asks once they're in the privacy of Agatha's kitchen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose, "I wasn't supposed to have him tonight."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stops doing whatever she was doing and takes a couple steps closer to Agatha, "What happened?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know." She shrugs, "Wanda wouldn't tell me. Just said it was an emergency."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Don't worry about it, I—I've got stuff for him."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That isn't what I'm worried about." Agatha murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak but is interrupted by the soft thuds of feet in the kitchen door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, baby?" She hastily turns around and walks over to Nicky, kneeling down infront of him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Um.." He looks down, playing with his hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's wrong?" Her voice becomes softer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I think I should tell you something." He says. "But it might make you sad."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can take care of myself, Nicky." Except she absolutely <em>can't</em>. Since hiring Rio, this is the first week she's eaten properly in months.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mom said that.." He trails off, looking down at the floor again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha places a hand on his shoulder, and she somewhat forgets that Rio's in the room. God, if whatever he says breaks her, she does <em>not</em> want Rio to see her like this. "What did your mom say?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She said she doesn't want me to see you anymore."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches, and she takes a long, slow blink. "Did she?" She can't even hide the tremble in her voice. "Did—did she say why?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nicky only shakes his head, frowning in a way that just breaks Agatha's heart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She didn't okay, and.." Agatha takes a deep breath, preparing herself for the worst, "is that what <em>you</em> want?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." He says quickly. "I don't want to not see you again, Mama."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Me neither, love. I'll talk to your mom, okay?" She tugs him a little closer, into a hug, lifting him up into her arms as she stands up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go play with your toys, baby, I'll call your mom in a bit."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." He says again, allowing Agatha to lower him to the floor and trotting off to the living room. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Only once he's left the room does Agatha allow herself to lean into the counter, hiding her face in her hands. She can hear the faint sound of footsteps towards her, followed by a warm hand on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That hand guides her closer until a pair of arms are curling around her, one in her hair and the other on her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your ex sounds like a dick." Rio says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a watery laugh, "Yeah, that's one way to put it." She grips Rio's clothes tightly, failing to ignore the way Rio's hands feel on her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hasn't felt like this in years, hasn't <em>wanted</em> someone like this in years. Wanted to hold them, feel them, <em>all of them.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Honestly, it scares her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a step back and clears her throat, her gaze averting to the floor so she doesn't actually have to see to softness in Rio's expression.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Rio asks, leaning against the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe later," Agatha sighs, "do you want a drink or anything?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll get it. You relax, go see your son."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, "Okay. Thank you, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiles in return, turning away to start preparing the dinner. "Are you alright with fish tonight?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. That's perfect." She says, before leaving the room and going back to her son.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At about five minutes to six, Agatha leads Nicky through to the dining room, laying the table and waiting for Rio to finish with the food. Judging by the lack of sounds from the kitchen, it'll be ready soon.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's right, Rio brings through a couple of plates, one with the fish and one with a plate of homemade chicken nuggets and chips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"M'lady," Rio lays the plate infront of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha mouths the words 'thank you' then gestures to the plate of Nicky's food, "You made these yourself?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I told you I'm good at my job," Rio shrugs, smiling. "I'll just be in the kitchen if you need me— need anything." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't mention the way she corrected herself, but only because Nicky was right beside them. They share a look, but Rio retreats back to the kitchen to continue cooking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once they're both finished with their <em>wonderful</em> food, Nicky practically drags Agatha back into the living room, nagging about having to watch the next episode of Bluey.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They sit for about twenty minutes before he falls asleep, snoring lightly and curled up on the sofa. Agatha uses the chance to talk to Rio properly, and maybe even ask her on that date if she's brave enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up slowly as to not wake Nicky, and strolls into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," She says quietly, her lips spreading into a soft smile when Rio turns to gaze at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I've made you some stuff for tomorrow, I was just gonna do something else for Thursday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods, stepping closer until she's stood beside Rio. She looks in the pot Rio's cooking in, and hums approvingly, "This smells good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Here, try some," Rio scoops a little up with a spoon and blows on it, then holds it up to Agatha's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without breaking eye contact, she leans forwards and slips the spoon into her mouth, closing her eyes with a soft moan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She sees Rio's eyes darken before she asks, "You like it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, "Very much. What is it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Albondigas." Rio says, stirring it some more, "It's the first thing my abuela taught me to cook."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How long have you lived here?" Agatha asks, leaning on the counter and propping her head up on her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"About ten years."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, you still speak Spanish?" She questions, a little breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns to her with a smug grin on her face and says, "Si, hermosa, todavía hablo español."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, her head falling back and hitting the wall with a thud, "Okay, not fair. God, I wish I could speak another language."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe I can teach you." Rio utters, distributing the albondigas into some tuppaware to keep in the fridge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, "I'm sure you can do a lot more than <em>that."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio glances at her as she steps over to the fridge, poking her tongue into her cheek. "Oh? Like what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her breath catches as she speaks, "You have lovely hands, Rio. Use your imagination."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As if doing exactly as Agatha had asked, she seemingly zones out, mindlessly grabbing some more ingredients and biting at her lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you imagining it, honey?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks over at her again, her cheeks a very clear pink.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You don't have to answer that, I know you are." Agatha chuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She exhales audibly shakily, grabbing a few tomatoes and chopping them up into fine pieces. "You seem to know a lot about me," She says, changing the subject. "What about you? Did you grow up here?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I grew up in Salem, actually." Agatha tilts her head to the side, running a hand through her own hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Salem? You're not a witch are you? Gonna curse me?" Rio gasps overdramatically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe I will if you keep up that attitude." Agatha says sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"When did you move to Westview?" Rio asks, pausing her preperationg for a moment to look at Agatha properly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A few months after I found out I was pregnant." She replies, "We wanted a new start."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, "Bad memories in Salem?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Something like that." Agatha shrugs, a flicker of sorrow dances across her features before she slips her mask back on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't push it. They aren't quite close enough despite the utter need between them. "How about I teach you a few words?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go on. I've been told I'm a good learner."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I bet you are." Rio murmurs, her eyes drooping a little. "Repeat after me, okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, her lips parted.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Eres muy guapa."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Eres..muy guapa?" She says it almost perfectly, save for the awful accent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Gracias!" Rio exclaims with a comically large grin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, <em>God</em>, what did you make me say?" Agatha groans with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't make you say anything." She shrugs innocently.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," She sighs again, still smiling and leaning against the wall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You said I'm very pretty, that's all."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha touches her own chin with her finger, pretending to consider it, "Well, I'm not wrong, am I?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"People don't usually say that." Rio mumbles, turning back to the produce on the chopping board. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What, you don't get told how gorgeous you are on the daily? Do you have any idea how attractive you are?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs nervously, scratching at her face in a bad attempt at hiding the way her cheeks are flushing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, seriously," Agatha continues, "you're.." She trails off with a sigh, "you're stunning."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, please, have you looked at yourself in the mirror recently?" Rio scoffs, the chopping of courgettes becoming more impatient.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Stop <em>deflecting—</em> what was it again? Eres.."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Muy guapa." Rio sighs, and as she does, Agatha jumps off of the counter and stands beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Eres muy guapa." Agatha says, then slowly reaches up, giving Rio a chance to say no. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's fingers lightly stroke through the tips of Rio's hair, whose breath hitches at the contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, the muffled sound of cries from the other room. Abruptly, Agatha pulls away, clearing her throat. Rio follows her lead, going back to prepping the remainder of the courgette.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I should—.." She gestures vaguely to the kitchen door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Rio nods, not even looking at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>. Agatha sighs, pausing, "Sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio flashes her a small smile, barely turning to her, "It's fine. Go see your kid."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another sigh, and a slow blink. Rio's gone back to cooking what will be Thursday's meal. Agatha just stands there for a moment, silently watching each of her movements while her brain is continuously telling her to go to Nicky. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio huffs, "go."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll come in when I'm done. Just.." Agatha notices the way her grip tightens on the knife a little, the way she tenses. "Just go."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but think she's fucked up. She wasn't imagining the flirting, was she? The way Rio was looking at her?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She turns around with yet another sigh and enters the living room. Nicky's curled up on the sofa, his face wet with previously shed tears.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," Agatha murmurs softly, sitting beside Nicky on the sofa, "what happened?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nightmare." He says quietly, so quietly that Agatha barely hears him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, baby." She pulls him close into a hug, and closes her eyes. Her brain, despite her best interests, decides to focus on the background noise of clattering from the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her fucking brain drifts to <em>Rio</em> while her <em>son</em> is <em>sobbing in her arms.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>What the fuck is wrong with her?</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, pressing a kiss to the top of his head and breathing in the smell of his hair, "It's okay. What was the dream about?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You and Mommy were fighting."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>. Agatha's awfully failed marriage had been leaving her son hardly able to sleep. She feels her eyes prick with tears, so she just holds him close. "What about?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Okay, could this evening get any fucking worse? Nicky stays quiet, just leaning into Agatha. A few moments pass of silence and stillness, save for the occasional noise from the kitchen. Agatha assumes he's fallen asleep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She uses the time to try to relax, not wanting to wake Nicky, but also not feeling completely able to face Rio after the..<em>whatever that was.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But the very fucking second Rio crosses her mind, she can't get rid of her. She doesn't understand— she didn't even want Wanda this much and they were fucking <em>married</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just standing infront of Rio, touching her hair like that, it made her feel right again. Like there wasn't something wrong with her, like she was starting to believe Wanda's words weren't true. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then it was the way Rio looked at her after. Agatha could only identify the look as regret. She could obviously have been wrong, but Rio hardly even <em>looked</em> at her. Maybe she had pushed a little too far this time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The speed at which she's been flirting and attempting to initiate anything has honestly scared her a little, so maybe that's how Rio felt too. Yeah, that would be much nicer to think about than the fact that Rio just pushed her away for getting too close.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn't sure how much time has passed when she hears Rio step in from the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm all done." She says under her breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Thank you," Agatha nods, "how much do I owe you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, come on—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just be a dear and let me pay you, Rio." Agatha cuts in softly, smiling. "How long were you here?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh— a—about three hours." Rio kneels down to start putting her shoes on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, four fifty. I'll send it over soon."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can't accept that." Rio shakes her head, laughing nervously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're exceptionally good at your job, sugar, just.." Agatha sighs, "please?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha swears she can see.. <em>something</em> flicker over Rio's features before she nods, "Okay, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently, Agatha lifts Nicky off of her lap and sets him down on the sofa. She stands up and sees Rio to the front door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Agatha says quietly, "for—for everything with Nicky, and.."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She smiles gently. "Just doing my job, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Right." She nods, "Well, I—I'll see you on Friday?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's smile grows, "Yeah. See you on Friday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha holds the door handle, squeezing tightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is everything—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." She opens the door quickly, stepping out of the way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Good night, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>God</em>, the way she says her name. It takes everything to not step forwards, pin her against the wall, kiss her—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forwards, placing a hand on her shoulder and lightly pressing her lips to Agatha's cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath catches in her throat, her hands clenching into fists so she doesn't do anything she'll regret.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio pulls back, she looks down at the floor, biting her bottom lip. "Friday." She repeats.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good night, Rio." She murmurs, unable to say much else.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Te veo."</p>

<p>Thursday morning, Rio meets Alice at a park, sat on a bench with the sun glaring at them through the cold air.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, what the fuck is going on with you?" Alice sighs, "This is clearly about Agatha, and you haven't been this worked up over a girl in years."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Alice I don't know what to fucking do." Rio buries her head in her hands, groaning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Have sex with her?" Alice shrugs, "From what you've told me, she clearly wants to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, I—.." Rio sighs. "I <em>really</em> like her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So...what's the problem?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know I don't do that. Plus she's just gotten divorced." Rio says flatly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Alice huffs dramatically, "You've mentioned that." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She won't want anything more than sex." Rio adds, "She probably just wants— I—I don't know, a distraction from her awful life."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, you know her well enough that you know she has an awful life?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay— no, I— it's implied." Rio stammers, "But <em>still</em>. God, she's so beautiful and smart and perfect, and so sweet and her <em>hair</em>, Alice, her <em>hair."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Talk to her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio says firmly. "Absolutely not. She's probably just being sweet so she gets me in bed with her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're already flirting, right?" Alice asks, completely ignoring Rio's previous comment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So why are you flirting if you won't even fuck her?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Because</em>, she—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just got divorced, yeah, but it's like you're leading her on."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's mouth falls open. "Fuck."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, fuck." Alice huffs a laugh, "Either get over yourself and talk to her, or stop flirting."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—..fuck, you're right, but she's so fucking gorgeous I just get carried away."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean <em>carried away?"</em> Alice asks, practically interrogating her at this point.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I may have.. kissed her on the cheek last time I saw her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Jesus, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do I do?" Rio asks desperately.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Like I've already said, <em>talk to her.</em> You're losing your mind, Rio. At least then you'll know whether it's just a sex thing for her, or not."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, fine. I'll try, but no promises. She has this habit of making me forget everything."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On Friday, Rio arrives at Agatha's house about fifteen minutes late. When the door opens, Agatha has her phone in her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." She says, relief evident on her face, "I—I was just about to text you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry," Rio steps inside and kicks her shoes off, "got caught up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio manages to get a subtle once-over, glancing at the way Agatha's blazer hugs her body, the trousers over her hips. The navy of them compliments her skin incredibly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's okay— are <em>you</em> okay?" Agatha asks, following Rio into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, fine." Absolutely <em>not</em> fine, because all she can think about is how disappointed she'll be when stunning Agatha tells her she doesn't want to commit to anything and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." She nods and gives Agatha a small smile, but doesn't look away quick enough to miss the worried look in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's hyper aware of Agatha's presence in the kitchen as she pulls out a chopping board and an onion. It's peeled much more carelessly than usual, but her mind is racing- she can't think straight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The tension is getting way too much. The onion's chopped unevenly, too quickly, her hands are shaking. She tries to just concentrate on the smell, the texture, and <em>not</em> on the light footsteps of Agatha behind her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She feels a sudden nick on her finger, and drops the knife onto the chopping board with a loud clatter, <em>"Fuck—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thick, red blood is steadily seeping from her finger, and she lifts it up to keep it from the food. Her hands are shaking more than they were before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shit, are you okay?" Agatha comes up behind her and turns her around by the shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's nothing." Rio insists, shaking her head with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're shaking." Agatha points out, taking Rio's cut hand in hers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let me help you, sugar." Agatha pulls her towards the sink, turns it on and holds her hand underneath the water. "Hold this here for a second,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and inhales shakily. The blood has nothing to do with it— nothing to do with the way it feels every so slightly harder to breathe. She hears Agatha leave the room, probably to get some sort of first aid kit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Waiting, she watches the blood mix in with the pouring water, beginning to grow a little clearer. It genuinely isn't that bad, aside from the constant stinging with the water running over it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha returns, she has her <em>gorgeous fucking glasses</em> on, and switches off the tap, gently grabbing Rio's hand again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches, and Agatha <em>definitely</em> notices. She glances up at Rio, her lips parted. "Uh— this might hurt." She says quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio nods, trying to relax her muscles, which becomes increasingly harder the longer they're having skin-to-skin contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a tea towel and wraps a layer around Rio's finger, putting pressure on it to stop the bleeding, and to dry the skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A small wince, followed by an extremely embarrassing whimper falls from Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay?" Agatha asks softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can't talk about it right now, so she settles on, "It hurts a little."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know what I mean, honey." She tilts her head with a gentle smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio just looks at her. Her striking blue eyes, over her cheekbones, landing on her lips— She clears her throat and meets Agatha's eyes again, a knowing look filling them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Everything's fine." Rio breathes, "I'm fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is it work?" Of course Agatha can just see straight through her lies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite it, Rio goes with the easy option of lying, "Yeah. I— not <em>this</em>, just..other stuff."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's happened?" She asks, her eyebrows pulling together in a frown.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Rio did <em>not</em> think this far ahead. She uses the time Agatha takes to carefully unwrap the tea towel from around her finger to think about another lie.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—I'm supposed to be catering for a wedding this weekend." She blurts out. "They've..just changed their minds on what they want the meals to be, so.."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that must be difficult." Agatha says, taking a plaster from the first aid kit and getting it ready.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Rio nods. Maybe she bought it? If she didn't she hasn't said anything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is there anything I can do to help?" She asks. "You can leave early today, if—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No—no, that's..I can figure something out."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." She smiles lightly, taking Rio's hand again and delicately placing the plaster over the cut. "There."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Take your time, okay? No rush." She says sweetly, pushing her glasses up her nose a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio absentmindedly follows the movement with her eyes, "Okay." Before turning back to the onion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>God, it looks like it's been ripped apart, she's never been this careless before. She'd always take time to make sure it was <em>perfect</em>, so that every individual piece was cooked <em>perfectly</em>. But no, they're all angled, uneven, and downright horrible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She collects the messed up pieces in her hands and drops them into the bin, starting again with a deep breath. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The glasses suit you." She hadn't even realised she had said it out loud until she hears Agatha's voice in response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah? My ex said they make me look like a shitty librarian." She scoffs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The <em>beautiful</em> librarian who you'd go ask questions to just as an excuse to look at her." What the fuck is she saying? She promised herself, <em>and Alice,</em> that she'd talk to Agatha to know her intentions. Why can't she control herself?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, "I'll take that as a compliment."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It is one." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Shut up shut up shut up</em>. Why can't Rio just grow up and talk to her like an adult? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What about you, any shitty exes?" Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe this is a good opportunity. Maybe she can talk to Agatha without actually <em>talking to her.</em> Besides, she wouldn't be lying, she has a good example to use.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, actually." Rio nods, "I was dating this girl a few years ago, we were together for, what, eight months?" She briefly turns to Agatha and her breath catches when she sees how intently she's listening. "Uh— t—turns out she didn't actually <em>like me</em> she just wanted the sex."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, "She sounds like a bitch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, "Oh, yeah. She pretended to be in love with me just for that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You must be good, then." Agatha jokes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I must be."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, seriously, that's awful. I can't imagine why someone would treat another person like that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Alright</em>, Rio nods, <em>good answer.</em> "She had only just broken up with <em>her</em> ex when we got together. I was just some..distraction for her to use."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's— God, you must've felt terrible." Agatha frowns, leaning back against the counter as per usual.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I did." Rio agrees, "Stopped working for a couple months afterwards. I just felt so.." She shrugs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Betrayed." Agatha finishes for her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Rio nods. That went a lot better than she had imagined, "Oh, how was the food the last couple of days?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It was great. Really good."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm glad you liked it." She says. Knowing Agatha's stance on the whole situation with her ex honestly does help her to relax. So, she won't exactly stop herself from flirting, but she can't completely commit without Agatha's word.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's for tonight?" Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was gonna do paella. The recipe I use leaves a lot of leftovers, so should be enough for tomorrow too." She explains. "And then I was gonna make up some bolognese for Sunday, and..macaroni cheese for Monday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Would you..want to stay for dinner tonight?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's jaw drops open, "I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a moment to study Agatha's face before nodding with a smile, "Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The relief which floods over Agatha's features is obvious, it makes Rio think she's actually starting to let her in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But the fact that Agatha still hasn't talked about her ex-wife in <em>any</em> context is really making her think otherwise. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio watches closely as Agatha takes her first bite of the paella at the dinner table. Taking in every little micro expression.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You okay?" Agatha asks, an amused smile on her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods quickly, "Yeah."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is really good, by the way."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She smiles, shaking her head slightly, "Oh, it's not perfect."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head to the side, her smile growing a little, "Why do you do that?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do..what?" Rio asks, pulling her eyebrows together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Refuse to take a compliment."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Rio sighs, "I guess I.. never really recieved them."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No?" Agatha has another bite of her food, frowning with confusion. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Never really learnt how to respond." Rio adds, pushing her food around the bowl.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let's practice." Agatha shrugs. "I mean, the longer you work for me, the more compliments you'll recieve."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— okay." This is probably a bad idea, considering Rio is still trying very hard to stick to her <em>don't fuck Agatha Harkness</em> rule. But she's so very hard to resist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So.." Agatha places her fork down for a moment and looks over Rio's face with delicate precision. The face which is no doubt bright red. "Your hair."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"..What about it?" Rio asks awkwardly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's divine. Looks really soft, too." Agatha might as well have said how badly she wants to run her hands through it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat in a hope that it can distract Agatha from the blatant shade of pink her cheeks have turned. "What do I say?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you?" Agatha laughs lightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank— thank you." Rio stutters, grabbing a mouthfull of food on her fork and shoving it in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She chuckles again, running a hand through her own hair, "Okay, as <em>adorable</em> as it is when you're flustered, say it <em>normally."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a second before repeating, "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There, that's it." Agatha gestures to her with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes Rio <em>everything</em> to try to ignore the growing heat in her lower stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, try again— you..you have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen." Rio swears she catches a little truth in Agatha's tone, but pushes it to the back of her mind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"..Thank you." Rio says quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're welcome." Agatha replies, scooping up some more rice onto her fork with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The remainder of their dinner is eaten in silence, and Rio somehow manages to convince Agatha to relax while she does her job and washes up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Finally, when the very last bit of washing up is done after cooking every last meal, she slips off the washing up gloves. As she does, she catches sight of the plaster on her finger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She traces over it lightly with her finger, wincing slightly at the pressure, getting completely lost in the memory of how soft Agatha's hands were.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How's your finger doing?" Agatha's voice rings out from behind her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio swings around, "Good. It's fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How much today?" She then asks, pulling her phone out from her pocket and pushing her glasses up her nose further.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Based on your rules, six hundred." Rio sighs. "But honestly, you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Done." She tucks her phone away again, taking a step back to encourage Rio to follow. "You deserve the money."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"See? You're getting better." Agatha teases, leading Rio back into the hallway.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, "Learned from the best. I'll see you on Tuesday?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods, glancing down at the floor. "Listen, I was wondering if—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A loud ring of Rio's phone cuts her off, prompting them both to sigh. "Sorry," She quickly takes it out and hangs it up, letting Agatha continue, "what were you saying?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh— nothing. It's nothing." She waves her hand around and chuckles lightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio nods, unconvinced, then takes a slow step forwards. Carefully, she wraps her arms around Agatha, pressing their bodies together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hugs can be friendly. They can be between friends who <em>definitely</em> don't want to fuck eachother senseless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio feels Agatha's arms hook around her shoulders, she finds herself wishing it was her bare skin. She can <em>feel</em> Agatha's breaths— slightly ragged, shallow. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She subconsciously traces patterns across Agatha's back, unsure of how long they've stood like this. Her head is resting on Agatha's shoulder, she's listening to the slight hitches in her breath at each movement over her spine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She then feels shy fingers comb through her hair, followed by the sound of a low laugh in her ear, "Your hair <em>is</em> soft."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio pulls away with a grin and shrugs. "Thanks."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bye, Rio." Agatha gives her a little wave before opening the front door, stepping to the side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio walks through, turning around to say, "Te veo." Before walking down the path and to her car.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, watching until she's out of sight, then shuts the door and thuds her head against it. "Fuck."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The simple texture of Rio's hair, the way she felt against her, the way she was holding her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She needs an ice cold shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a few seconds to lock the door and slip her glasses off, placing them on the counter in the hallway. Only then does she rush upstairs to the bathroom, running the shower as cold as she can physically handle it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She spends about five minutes staring at herself in the mirror, murmuring something about <em>stop rushing things, she's so obviously conflicted, stop pressuring her.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a loud, deep sigh, Agatha shrugs her blazer off, unbuttons her shirt and trousers, takes off her underwear, and steps into the shower. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her jaw tightens at the temperature, but she makes no point to change it as she steps beneath the water, the cold completely enveloping her. She had hoped it would clear her mind, allow her to build up the courage to text Rio and ask about that date she was going to ask about- if not for Rio's phone going off. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Brilliant fucking timing.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha massages her head with the shampoo a little more roughly than she usually would, as if trying to clean her <em>thoughts</em> and not her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The thoughts don't stop though, not when Rio had held her like that. She can't think about anything else except for how Rio's hands felt on her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sure, Rio had hugged her before, but that was different. There was no gentle caressing of her back, no uneven breaths.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, leaning back into the tiles and hissing slightly at the feel of them against her skin. Rio would be warm— <em>No. Stop. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another sigh falls from her lips as she runs some conditioner through her hair, shivering with the cold, which is <em>not</em> doing anything to clear her head. She rinses it out, her hands and back becoming slightly numb under the water.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's phone buzzes against the bedside table when she sits down on her bed in her pyjamas. She shouldn't work herself up about the <em>what ifs— what if it's Rio?</em> So she picks it up and— fuck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 17, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio: not sure if i said this already but thanks for patching me up earlier</p><p>
<em>10:36pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>What?</em> How is she supposed to respond to that? <em>Oh, yeah, no worries, in fact I couldn't stop thinking about that fucking finger inside me all evening</em>. Her thumbs hover over the keyboard for a few moments before she settles on sending:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>agatha: You're welcome. It is doing okay?</p><p>
<em>10:38pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: much better yeah</p><p>
<em>10:38pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: sleep well, Agatha. see you on tuesday x</p><p>
<em>10:39pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>agatha: You too, Rio.</p><p>
<em>10:40pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>sleep well, Agatha</em>. She sighs, dropping her phone back onto the bedside table and plugging the charger in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she lies in bed a few moments later, Agatha can't escape her mind. The duvet is bunched up as tightly around her as possible, desperately trying to stop the shivering lingering from her useless shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>sleep well, Agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs once more, but this time a little softer. Her arms are curled around herself, squeezing slightly at her sides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her mind drifts to Rio. Rio's eyes, her mouth, her hair, her voice. Slowly, her hand trails down to her inner thigh, delicately stroking higher until she makes contact with a surprising amount of wetness literally <em>dripping</em> down her thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She bites her lip, shuddering as she pushes her hand underneath her underwear and slides a finger through her folds. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>sleep well, Agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A soft whimper breaks the silence of the room when her finger brushes her clit. And when she realises that <em>God, this is all for Rio</em>, her fingers falter. She has never been this wet before, not even with her ex-<em>wife</em>, and definitely not by <em>thinking</em> about someone, someone she hardly knows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The tension in her lower stomach, however, is too much to ignore. Agatha continues circling her clit, her free hand coming up to brush her hair out of her face. She moans again, closing her eyes and letting her head fall back into the pillows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With no resistance, she pushes two fingers into herself, letting her mind do it's own thing. That thing happens to be replaying the hug earlier that day, the kiss on her cheek from the time before, random things Rio's said to her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>sleep well, Agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She whimpers, curling her fingers and manoeuvring her thumb to brush at her clit with each gentle thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can <em>hear</em> how wet she is, imagining Rio between her legs, lapping her up. "Fuck, fuck, fuck— <em>please, sugar." </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just by the thought of Rio and her own touch, she's become a babbling mess, muttering to no one but herself. Her fingers hit that perfect spot inside her simultaneous to her thumb against her clit, drawing a choked moan from her as she arches her back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, <em>Rio—"</em> She stops herself from saying anything else by speeding her movements up, stopping herself from speaking entirely. She can deal with the shame of it later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha comes with a silent scream, working herself through the aftershocks with soft whimpers. She spends a few moments catching her breath, staring at the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She needs to talk to her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha arrives back to work after her weekly therapy session, practically collapsing onto the chair in her office.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She groans, rubbing her forehead before logging back into her computer. Barely five minutes into scrolling through her email inbox, she hears a knock on the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Teen?" She calls out, waiting for the boy to come in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The door opens slowly, and Billy Kaplan, her assistant, walks in with his free hand clenched into a fist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" Agatha gestures to him expectantly, though a part of her does pity the worry in his face, whatever it's for.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Miss Harkness, I—I just wanted to warn you that—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Warn</em> me?" She huffs a laugh, "Always so <em>dramatic</em>, Teen."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your ex-wife is on her way."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's face falls, looking up at her assistant with an expression that can only be described as complete and utter hysteria. "What?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanda Maximoff—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know who my ex-wife is, <em>Teen</em>, what do you mean she's on her way?" She says, making an effort to not direct her anger toward the boy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She—she just called." He explains, "She..said you knew."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, muttering, "Of course she did. Okay." She shakes her head, "Do me a favour and move my two o'clock to tomorrow?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Miss Harkness." Billy nods, and he's about to turn around when the door is pushed further open and Agatha's worst nightmare walks into the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanda, darling, so lovely of you to stop by." Agatha exclaims sarcastically, then, without tearing her gaze from her ex-wife, she says to Billy, "Teen, why don't you go do whatever you do? Mommy and Daddy need to have a talk."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Miss Harkness." He repeats, awkwardly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What the fuck are you doing here?" Agatha snaps, leaning back into her chair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Wanda doesn't reply, Agatha presses further, raising her voice a little, "What do you want?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighs. "I want you to stop seeing Nicky. To stop getting these ideas into his head—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Ideas?"</em> Agatha parrots, "And, pray tell, what ideas are these?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That we loved eachother." Wanda spits, pointing an accusing finger at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We <em>did</em> love eachother, incase you've forgotten," Agatha folds her arms, narrowing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda huffs, throwing her arms up in a frenzy. "Not in the last three years, at least."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, did you want me to tell him how we had been drifting apart for years before you fucked your <em>boss?"</em> Agatha argues, her brows furrowing in a deep frown. "He's eight years old, Wanda, I'm not going to do that, I don't care what you say."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda doesn't reply, only looking with pure disgust at the woman infront of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Agatha continues, "And, you know what? He's <em>my</em> fucking son, Wanda. <em>I</em> wanted him, <em>I</em> got pregnant, <em>I</em> gave birth to him, and you just keep him from me? What the hell is wrong with you— I—I mean you must have a <em>damn good lawyer</em> because I have no idea how you managed to walk away with majority custody—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, please, I'm just keeping him from his horrible excuse for a mother." Wanda sighs with a proud smirk on her face, "You're lucky, really, you'll turn into <em>your</em> mother soon enough."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her throat tighten up, her lungs feeling smaller.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're <em>just</em> like her." She scowls, before spinning on her heel and storming out of Agatha's office.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda's left Agatha as a complete mess, breathing unevenly through her mouth, clutching the fabric of her clothes with her hands. These days, most mentions of her late mother left her trembling, but when it was like <em>this—</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Miss Harkness, is everything.." Billy murmurs, but trails off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Close everything I have for today, Billy." She says quickly but quietly, turning off her computer and grabbing her things with shakey hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't wait for him to respond, too eager to leave the building so she can at least break down in peace. She feels her eyes stinging with tears, walking through the streets with cars rushing past her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can't breathe. Desperately, she tries some of the excersises Dr Gray had taught her, but they don't work. Nothing works. So, she takes her phone out as the first of many tears fall, about to text the one person she actually wants to talk to right now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 21, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>agatha: Are you busy right now?</p><p>
<em>12:14pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps walking, trying to get home as quickly as possible. With no reply coming through, she resorts to calling her. She's too panicky to care that she's desperate. Her phone is held close to her ear, waiting for it to answer. "P—Please pick up." She murmurs to herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It rings four times before there's an answer, and Agatha stops in her tracks for a moment before walking again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Agatha? Is everything—"</em> Then, more muffled, <em>"Shut up, Alice!"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can—" A quiet sob cuts her off, "a—are you busy?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>That doesn't matter, are you okay?"</em> Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— not— not exactly," Her pace quickens.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"You sound like you're having a panic attack— do you need me to come over early today?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Why does Rio have to be so fucking sweet all the time? "I'm— I'm not— not at home, I'm walking home f—from work."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Okay, is there anywhere quiet you can go for a few minutes?"</em> She asks, her voice sounding a little softer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh— y—yeah, yeah." She tries to suck up the embarrassment of Rio hearing her like this, and instead attempts to simply focus on Rio's words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Lean on something— the wall, whatever, try to ground yourself."</em> She says, and Agatha hears movement across the phone. <em>"Can you do me a favour, Agatha?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Anything." She mumbles, but immediately regrets it with the implications.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't seem to notice though, or if she does, she's too focused on Agatha to care, <em>"I need you to take a deep breath in for me, and after you breathe out, name me something you can see. Can you do that?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—I think so." She frowns, a couple more tears spilling down her face. She's never felt this cared for in her <em>life</em>, and it's by a woman she's barely known for a month. She leans against a brick wall as per Rio's previous request.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Okay, good, now deep breath in,"</em> When she hears that Agatha has, she says, <em>"now hold it, uno, dos, tres, and out again. What's something you can see?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh— c—cars." Her mind lingers on the Spanish, the sound of Rio's voice as she said it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"That's it, and again?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They repeat it until Agatha's breathing has evened out and her voice is hardly trembling anymore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Are you feeling any better?"</em> Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— yeah. Thank you for..answering." Agatha's head thuds against the wall, "I didn't know who else to.." She trails off into silence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Don't worry about it. I'm glad you called."</em> She says, pure truth in her tone. <em>"When are you going to get home?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"In about fifteen minutes." She replies, starting her walk back home. She's noticed a few text messages from Billy, asking what's happened, but she just ignores him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Great, I'm outside your front door."</em> Rio explains casually.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait—wait, what?" Agatha chuckles, holding the phone closer to her ear so she can hear her more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I'm going to make you lunch— assuming you haven't eaten already?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Rio keeps giving Agatha reasons to fall even harder than she already has, "I can't ask you to do that, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"You don't have to. I want to."</em> Agatha can practically hear her smile over the phone. <em>"Please?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Thank you. I'll be there in ten." She says quickly, chewing at her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Te veo, Agatha."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bye, Rio." She mutters with a smile. Every ounce of embarrassment and shame she had felt for calling Rio has no completely dissipated, leaving her with utter adoration.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Walking up to her house, Agatha spots Rio leaning on the porch banister, her legs crossed, scrolling through her phone. She's holding her usual tote bag, presumably containing various ingredients for today's lunch and dinner for the next couple of days. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha strolls closer, Rio catches her out of the corner of her eye, looking up with a smile. "Hey."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't have to do this, Rio." Agatha sighs, smiling softly as she unlocks and opens the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio follows her inside, shrugging. "I know." She kicks her boots off and slips her coat off, handing it to Agatha when she offers to take it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha's more or less expected by now, Rio looks amazing. She's wearing a black ribbed vest with a forest green corduroy long sleeve over the top, and a pair of dark blue jeans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It completely contrasts Agatha's, smart purple slacks with a white blouse and black stiletto heels.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows Rio into the kitchen like usual, watching as she prepares all of the boards and bowls she might need. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Rio asks, quickly looking behind at Agatha, who's now sat on the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not right now. But thank you." She says quickly, then frowns, gesturing to the two small pumpkins Rio's taken out, "What's for lunch?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Soup." She says, "You do like pumpkin, right?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. That's..thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles in response, taking out the remaining ingredients and starting to chop them up. Agatha's simply happy to sit in her company, they don't need to say anything to eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Though, the silence brings tension, a certain tension Agatha would rather not feel right now. "So..you grow..pumpkins in that greenhouse of yours?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Rio nods, pouring the blended pumpkin into a pot and turning the heat up, "I have all sorts."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Like what?" She asks, hoping a conversation will stop making her think about how much she wants to make the woman infront of her come harder than she has in her entire life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I have a few dragon fruit going, but they still have a few months to go. Mostly just vegetables though, lots of carrots."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You'll have to bring me some dragon fruit once it's all grown." Agatha comments, rolling the sleeves of her shirt up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll bring you whatever you ask me to." Rio says quietly, her face a little flushed when she turns around to look at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The lunch doesn't take too long to make, only about fourty minutes, and Rio stays to avoid Agatha being alone. But she uses the excuse that she'd be back in a few hours anyway so she <em>might as well.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How did you know how to do all of that?" Agatha then asks, vaguely, as they eat the soup.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Make soup?" Rio asks, smiling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, the.." She looks down for a moment, then returns her gaze to Rio's big brown eyes as she says, "the breathing thing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Rio exhales audibly, stiring her soup around and blowing on it before taking another mouthfull, "Uh..I— my abuela taught me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At Agatha's expression, her head tilted and her eyebrows pulling together a little, she feels inclined to continue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I used to get them when I was younger," She explains, "after my—.." She visibly tenses, "after my parents died."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Rio, I'm so sorry." Agatha says, the empathy clear in her voice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's fine." Rio dismisses it with a wave of her hand, taking more soup into her mouth, "I was ten, it..it's fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "What happened?" She asks, carefully studying Rio's face and body language.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Car accident. I was with my abuela when it happened." Rio explains, sighing. It's silent for a second before she adds, "Y'know, you're the second person I've ever told about this."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am?" Agatha's voice goes up an octave, her eyebrows raising in surprise.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Alice is the only other."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And Alice is your.." She trails off, but the question still lands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My friend." Rio chuckles,<em> "Just</em> a friend. First friend I had when I moved here; we worked in the kitchen together." She looks up at Agatha again, "She works at— you know that Italian place a few blocks down?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, still eating her soup and stopping with the occasional sip of water. "Good place."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I worked there for a bit too, when I first moved here. That was before I got all into the..private side of things."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, pleased that Rio's comfortable enough with her to say all of this.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, enlighten me," Rio says, "how did the great Agatha Harkness make it to where she is today?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a small laugh, pushing her finished soup away a little, <em>"That's</em> what you want to know about me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, yeah." Rio shrugs, ripping a piece of bread off to dip in the soup, "I mean, it's incredible, you did it all on your own. No help from <em>anyone</em>, not even your parents."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's jaw tenses a little at the mention of her parents, but sees past it to continue the conversation with the beautiful chef infront of her, "I see you've read about me." She says with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, yes, I did. I knew I had heard your name <em>somewhere</em> when you reached out. Turns out it was in the countless interviews and news articles."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles again, and comes to welcome the topic when she sees how genuinely interested Rio is. "It took a <em>lot</em> of patience." She says, "I mean, like you said, I had..no help. My parents—" She sighs, "I never met my father but my mother did <em>not</em> approve of it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn't sure why she's saying all of this. No interviewer has ever heard it, no one except her ex-wife, which she doesn't even really count anymore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs from across the table, "Why not? You're ridiculously successful, how could she not?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She was very, <em>very</em> Christian. Stereotypical beliefs, that sort of..thing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Was?" Rio asks gently, clearly curious but not wanting to force anything out of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Died when Nicky was four."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She frowns, playing with her hands, "Shit, I'm sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't be," Agatha shakes her head with a soft smile, "It's been..twenty-seven years, give or take, since I've seen her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilts her head to the side, silently asking the question of <em>why?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kicked me out when I was eighteen." She looks down at the table and frowns, "You could probably guess <em>why</em>, considering the whole..stereotypical beliefs thing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But still, Agatha doesn't tell the whole story. Not because she doesn't trust Rio, but because she isn't ready, not yet. So, she leaves the bit about her mother at that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was good at the job," She says, "and I worked my way up to the top. Took a decade, but.." She shrugs, "here now. Does that answer your question?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I— yeah." It's obvious Rio's completely forgotten what her question even was.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A phone call rings out in the room, and Agatha instantly recognises it as her own and picks her phone up, about to answer, but Rio's voice stops her for a moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll get cleared up while you.." She gestures to the phone, "then I'll start with the dinners."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods and flashes her a smile before getting up and leaving the room to answer the call. She stands against the wall in the hallway, knowing full well that Rio would be able to listen in if she really wanted to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Miss Harkness?"</em> The assistant's voice comes through the phone. She isn't exactly surprised he called, just surprised he called this soon.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Teen?" She asks, pretending that morning hadn't even happened.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I have a few charity workers here, asking for you. Will you be coming back today?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." She says, "I won't. Tell them to come by tomorrow if it's urgent, and if not, get them to call me directly tomorrow."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Yes, Miss Harkness. I also..is everything okay?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The concern brings a gentle smile to Agatha's lips. She can admit to herself that she's genuinely fond of the boy, but she'd never admit it to anyone else. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He's clearly terrified of her, but he cares. He's a twenty-year-old gay kid, of course he cares about his hot, mean, older lesbian boss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Billy." She says softly. "Everything's fine."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kid would even come to her sometimes about his own boy problems if she was in a good enough mood, and she can't help but genuinely appreciate that he'd go to her. She can be tough on him, but nothing she knows he can't handle. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Okay. I can keep her out of your office in the future."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I would really appreciate that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Will you be back tomorrow?"</em> He asks, unintentionally sounding desperate for her to return. <em>"Those old guys keep talking to me."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She chuckles quietly, "Yes, I think I'll be back tomorrow," and she turns back into the kitchen now that she knows it's not a bad call, glancing at Rio, who has her back turned.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Thank God."</em> He groans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mind coming in earlier tomorrow morning? I could use your help with something." She gazes at Rio again. Who would be perfect to go to when having girl problems? The boy who goes to her with boy problems.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Yeah, of course, Miss Harkness. What about?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, y'know." She sighs, gesturing at nothing in particular.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"I don't know."</em> Billy says awkwardly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay— I'll see you tomorrow, Teen, don't you have work to do?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He replies quickly with a typical, <em>"Yes, Miss Harkness."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bye, Billy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Bye."</em> He hangs up instantly after he says it, leaving Agatha huffing a laugh and putting her phone in her pocket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who was that?" Rio asks, just finishing with the washing up, about to take some ingredients out for dinner.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My assistant." Agatha sighs, "He worries, but I also scare the shit out of him."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio flashes her an unimpressed look, before going back to the ingredients.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not on <em>purpose."</em> She exclaims, "I probably scare every twenty-year-old gay boy, but they still love me and come to me with boy problems."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's sweet." Rio says, taking a carrot and potato out of her tote bag.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The underlying tension between them grows with every word they share, and it becomes undeniable when they're cleaning up together after dinner, and after Rio's finished cooking everything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Green looks good on you." Agatha mentions, saying it like it's nothing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Purple looks good on <em>you."</em> She replies, looking her up and down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." She says, failing to keep eye contact, because how can she <em>not</em> look at Rio's lips when they're right infront of her?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, low and husky, "Thank <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's a shame, I can't tease you about not taking compliments anymore." She pouts sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm getting used to it with the amount you give me." She shrugs, acting as if it isn't obvious she wants to take Agatha right then and there.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How can I surprise you.." She murmurs to herself, before an invisible light bulb lights up over her head, "Oh! No puedo dejar de pensar en ti."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio swings herself around to look her in the eye, her eyes narrow and dark, biting her lip. "Sorry?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Did I say it wrong?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No," Rio hums, tilting her head, "yo tampoco puedo"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's <em>cheating,"</em> Agatha playfully shoves her, "I don't know anything else."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're saying you learnt a single sentence just to tell me you <em>couldn't stop thinking about me</em> in my own language?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"..Maybe." Agatha bites her lip, frowning. "What did <em>you</em> say?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Neither can I."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it as an invitation, placing her wet, soapy hands on Rio's face and pulling her closer until their lips meet in a bruising kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her lips are soft and tender against Agatha's, but also dominating, taking control and leaving practically no discussion about it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands settle on Agatha's hips, dragging her closer until their bodies are fully pressed together. She skillfully turns them so that Agatha's pinned to the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The relief of finally being allowed to touch Rio like this draws a low, satsfied moan from the back of Agatha's throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, it becomes too real. Rio stiffens, taking a small step back. She looks over Agatha, looks over herself, looking at her thigh between Agatha's legs, looking at Agatha's kiss-swollen lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, her hands still on Rio's face. "Rio? Are you—" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—I can't—" She fully steps away. "I can't do this."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Agatha follows her as she rushes through the house. "What are you— Rio, I thought—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I'm sorry, but I can't just be another—another <em>distraction</em> for someone, I—I can't, Agatha." As she speaks, she carelessly pulls her boots on and opens the front door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha calls out, watching Rio walk away, getting in her car as quickly as possible and driving off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When it's clear Rio is gone, Agatha closes the door and bangs her head against it. Once, twice, and just one more time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't sleep that night.</p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>agatha: And we really need to fucking talk.</p><p>
<em>5:31pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio never showed up for work, nor did she reply to any of Agatha's texts. They were read, Agatha knows they were, and that makes it worse. Rio read all of them, and still chose not to reply.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It ruins Agatha to no end. Not only does she miss Rio, but she misses her company. The energy when she was in the house. The cooking. <em>Fuck</em>, her touch, her voice, her smile, her laugh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't know what to do, and Rio refuses to answer her texts or calls. Unless— <em>no</em>. That would be overstepping, right? But it's the only way Agatha can think of to get Rio to at least reply to her, even if it's telling her to stop contacting her. Agatha would still do it. For Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finds out the name of where Rio's friend works, and calls their number in the hope that she can get any way to talk to Alice. Surely Rio's best friend, who she's known for over a decade, can talk some sense into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Hello, how can I help you?"</em> A waiter, Agatha assumes, says from across the line.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I need to speak to one of the chefs." Agatha says firmly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The waiter's voice falters, <em>"Uh— who is it you're after?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Alice. I don't know her last name— fuck, I'll pay you, just— get her. Please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I'll see what I can do, but she may be busy."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell her it's an emergency, tell her Agatha Harkness is on the phone. She'll answer."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Please hold."</em> The line goes quiet, and when five minutes pass, Agatha thinks they've hung up. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That is, until a different voice comes through. <em>"What— hello?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Alice?" Agatha checks, concerned that the waiter had run to grab the first chef in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Yeah, what— what's going on? Is Rio okay?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's what I was going to- why isn't she answering my texts?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"What? I have no idea, she— she hasn't spoken to me."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can you please tell her to answer? I really need to talk to her." Agatha usually won't be this polite, but she needs to talk to Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Why? Why won't she talk to you?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, anything to get Rio to answer, "I kissed her and she was into it, but then she freaked out and started ignoring me. She was meant to cook tonight too, hasn't shown up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck, I told her to—"</em> Alice sighs loudly into the phone, <em>"did she not tell you?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what?" Agatha asks, frowning, but when no reply comes, she says desperately, "Alice, tell me what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"She doesn't do just sex." </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I figured. Neither do I." Agatha's frown deepens, "So, what, she thought I.."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Look, I'll talk to her tomorrow morning. I'll get her to talk to you, but I'll leave it to you to tell her everything."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you so much. This means a lot, Alice. How— how can I repay you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Just..don't break her heart, okay? She really likes you."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I really like her, too."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The phone hangs up, and Agatha uses the few leftovers from one of Rio's meals to have for dinner. It was a mistake— it just reminds Agatha of her so much that she can hardly eat it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following day turns into the very first Saturday where she goes into work. For once, she's glad it isn't a Nicky weekend, giving her the chance to some real privacy to hopefully talk to Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She goes in for about four hours before Billy insists she goes home, and he masks his genuine concern with telling her she's <em>not even working.</em> Which, admittedly, she wasn't doing any work at all, but she'd rather have been doing nothing there than overthinking about Rio at home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Still, she goes home as per Billy's request, stopping off at the florist's down the road. She asks the florist very specific questions based on the meaning of the flowers, settling on what comes to a <em>very</em> expensive bouquet to bring home, ready to give to Rio. If she comes over, that is.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The bouquet consists of blue hyancinths, symbolising apologies. White roses, to tell Rio she wants to make amends. Purple irises, signifying that Agatha understands she went wrong, she should've made her wants clear. Bleeding hearts, symbolising her lo— her <em>fondness</em> of Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha arrives home a good half hour later, not bothering the change out of her work clothes. She's wearing an oversized cream suit, thick matching belt and a grey turtleneck jumper. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If she's going to end up seeing Rio today, she may as well look good while doing it. About an hour passes, trying to engross herself in a documentary before she hears her phone buzz from the coffee table. Then another.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She'd be lying if she said she didn't jump out of her seat to read it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 25, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio: i'm so fucking sorry for freaking out Agatha</p><p>
<em>1:42pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: can i come over?</p><p>
<em>1:42pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>agatha: Of course.</p><p>
<em>1:43pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio: i'll be there in 15</p><p>
<em>1:43pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next fifteen minutes are excruciating. Agatha paces around the house, through the hall, up the stairs, around her room, downstairs, around the kitchen, and back again. She's done about seven laps, <em>not that she's counting</em>, before she hears a hesitant knock on the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops in her tracks, rushes to the kitchen from the hallway and grabs the bouquet of flowers. God, she hopes Rio actually understands what she's trying to say with them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She unlocks and opens the door, and her breath hitches when she sees Rio standing there, her hands tucked away in her pockets. The bouquet is hidden behind the door, not wanting to push anything on her just yet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Since when do you work on weekends?" Is the first thing Rio says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mouth just falls open, and she steps aside to let Rio in, "I— just today." She mumbles, a slight waver in her voice. She closes the door. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio surprisingly takes her shoes off, leaning against the wall of the hallway, "I'm just going to say what I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears her falter and turns around, taking in what she's wearing for the first time. A pair of loose, wispy, floral trousers, and that green corduroy long sleeve from last time. Enough buttons are undone that if she looks at the right angle, she can see—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, what the fuck is this?" She gestures to the hundred dollar bouquet in her hands. She expresses exasperation, but Agatha can see the moment each of the flower's meanings click in Rio's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just— talk to me. Please." Agatha sighs and sets the flowers down on a counter, "One second you're all over me and the next, you—" She shakes her head, "What happened?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck." Rio closes her eyes for a moment, "Look, I don't do just sex and I assume that's what you want because you just got divorced—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—and—and you'd want, like, a distraction or something—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sugar—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—and I didn't mean to lead you on, I just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio." Agatha sighs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—you're so fucking beautiful and I didn't want to get disappointed when you said that you didn't want an actual relationship so I just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, honey, please." Agatha places a hand on her arm, softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The nickname put with the pet name and the physical contact leads Rio to stop talking, waiting for Agatha to say what she needs to say, to tell her she's right and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This isn't just sex for me." She says gently, giving Rio's arm a little squeeze.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It..it isn't?" She furrows her brows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No. I don't want you for sex. I don't want you as a distraction. I don't want you for your incredible cooking skills, as incredible as they are." Agatha lists, smiling softly, "I just want <em>you</em>, sugar. And I'd like to take you out on a date, if you'll have me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of using her words, Rio takes a tentative few steps forwards into Agatha's space and cups her cheeks, pulling her into a gentle kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands land on Rio's hips, instantly melting into the kiss with a hum. She breaks it for a moment to say, "I'll take that as a yes,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, yes. I'm sorry I was so—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up and kiss me." One of Agatha's hands slides up to curl into Rio's hair, while the other tightens it's grip on her hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does, stepping even closer to Agatha until their bodies are completely flush. It doesn't take her long to figure out that Agatha's still giving her the option of walking away. While Rio knows damn well Agatha wants her as much as <em>she</em> wants Agatha, Rio can see— or rather, <em>feel</em> that Agatha's still holding back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls away a little, brushing their lips together as she speaks, "I want this. I want <em>you</em>, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip, "Yeah?" Her gaze is solely on Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I was scared to talk to you, to— to ask what your intentions were, I guess, but now that I know for <em>sure</em>, that this," She gestures in the small space between them, "isn't <em>just</em> sex, I want it. <em>You."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank fuck for that." Agatha huffs a laugh and kisses her again, the force of it sending Rio stumbling back into the wall with a light thud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It startles Rio into opening her mouth, but she absolutely is <em>not</em> complaining, not when Agatha's tongue slides against her own, how it traces small circles on the roof of her mouth. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can't stifle the whimper that falls from her lips, her back arching when Agatha pushes her tongue deeper into her mouth. They both moan into the kiss, Agatha's free hand flying up to comb through Rio's hair, the tenderness contrasting the kiss in every way possible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha breaks the kiss, a string of saliva connects them, which breaks within seconds when she dips her head and lands wet kisses across her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck," Rio sighs, closing her eyes and encouraging Agatha more into her with a hand on her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops for a few seconds, not pulling away but no longer kissing her. It doesn't take long for Rio to realise why. She had pulled away so she can properly focus on the needy whine landing straight in her ear, as Agatha slides her thigh between Rio's legs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Only then does Agatha continue her ministrations, taking what Rio is so easily providing her, and tugging gently on Rio's hair to angle her neck for more access.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio subtly grinds down on Agatha's leg, pulls her closer, <em>fuck</em>, she needs this woman so fucking bad.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio takes a tighter hold on Agatha's hair and pulls her head up, taking notice of the whimper and the way her chest is heaving.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before she says anything, she crashes her lips into Agatha's in one slow kiss, then physically has to push her away, holding her by the jaw to keep their lips a hair's width apart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where the hell is your bedroom?" Rio breathes against her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Someone's desperate." Agatha muses, tangling her hands in Rio's hair with a content sigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can you blame me?" She husks, "I've wanted you since I laid eyes on you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha puts more pressure behind her thigh for a moment, before pulling away completely and holding out her hand, "This way, sugar,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes Agatha's hand, lacing their fingers together and allowing herself to be taken upstairs. The first door on the right after taking a left, Agatha opens, stepping into her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The entire aura of the room feels expensive, just by it's presence. And so very <em>Agatha</em>. Three of the walls have a black and purple wallpaper, and the other wall painted purple. It has probably the softest carpet Rio's ever felt, but she barely feels it with the speed at which Agatha walks her over to the edge of the bed, stopping when her legs have made contact with it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To Rio's surprise, Agatha doesn't immediately guide her onto the bed, instead running her hands up and down Rio's sides. She eventually settles at the buttons of her shirt, raising an eyebrow in question when Rio grasps her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods her consent and Agatha wastes no more time, unbuttoning her shirt. She leaves it open at first, looking over the newly exposed skin. Her gaze is then pulled to the black lacey bra that Rio's wearing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches up and traces the upper line of it, "You wore <em>this</em>...knowing you'd see me today?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I wore it every day I saw you." Rio breathes, sliding off her shirt and letting it drop to the floor. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She hears Agatha's breath hitch, voice faltering, "I— y—you look..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll take that as a compliment." Rio smiles mockingly, pressing a quick kiss to her lips before pulling her trousers down and letting them drop to her ankles, then steps out of them. Thank God she chose to wear something loose. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands land on Rio's hips, dipping her fingers slightly below the waistband of her matching underwear. Her lips are parted, pupils dilated more than Rio's ever seen them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few moments pass, looking between eachother's eyes and lips, before Rio slips her hands under Agatha's blazer, tugging her closer by her waist into a deep kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first touch Agatha lands on Rio's bare stomach has her whimpering against her lips. Her skin's warm and smooth and somehow radiating Rio's desire, and Agatha can't get enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her hands trail up Rio's body as the kiss deepens, sucking Rio's tongue into her mouth, until they land at her hair, tugging her away just to crash their lips together with more force.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls at the fabric of Agatha's turtleneck, groaning against her lips, "Why the fuck are you wearing so many clothes?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was at work." Agatha chuckles, low and husky, shrugging her blazer off and throwing it onto the chair in the corner of her room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't care. Too many." Rio works at the belt with both hands, tugging it off and chucking it across the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs another laugh, allowing Rio to desperately undress her. First the turtleneck— the second it's off, Rio's hands curl round the back of Agatha's neck and she presses their lips together again, only to slide to her shoulders, her arms, her waist, her stomach. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio's hands brush over Agatha's bra though, her lips falter and she glances down to see the navy blue lace covering her chest. "And you were teasing <em>me."</em> She smirks, moving her hands down to the waistband of Agatha's trousers, relishing in the way her breath hitches.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I was hopeful." Agatha shrugs, taking Rio's hands and guiding them to the button of her trousers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She lets Rio do the rest herself, dragging the trousers down Agatha's legs, kneeling down as she does it, and tapping each ankle to signal for her to step out of the fabric.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches down and hooks a finger under Rio's chin, tilting her head up and biting her lip as she does so. "Come here,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Almost instantly, Rio stands up and sets her hands on Agatha's waist, taking notice of the heat of her skin. Agatha's hands gently push her to sit on the edge of the bed, throwing her arms around her shoulders and following, straddling her thighs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands shift to sit on Agatha's legs, running up and down while openly staring at the woman in her lap, the woman whose hands are softly caressing her cheeks and combing through her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You have no idea how badly I want you." Agatha murmurs, leaning close enough so their lips touch, but not enough to be a kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I think I have some idea." Rio counters, gliding her hands up to Agatha's hips, then up round the back of her neck. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets herself get pulled closer, their kiss intense but incredibly tender. She deepends it quickly, grazing Rio's bottom lip with her tongue until her lips part, welcoming it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The force of her lips push Rio back into the bed, Agatha dropping ontop of her, letting the majority of her body weight rest on her. Rio whimpers into the kiss once again, prompting Agatha to roll her hips into her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Failing to get any good friction, she swings a leg to rest between Rio's, so she's straddling a single thigh. Not only does it do wonders for Agatha when she rocks against her, but the muscle of her thigh presses right into Rio's clit, resulting in them both releasing breathy mewls into eachother's mouths. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And upon hearing Rio like that, so unguarded and vulnerable and <em>desperate</em>, she's decided she won't ever get enough of it. She needs more, needs to hear more, needs to feel Rio unravel right beneath her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, what do you like?" Agatha asks, leaning her forehead into Rio's, who's so out of it, it's almost funny.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" Rio squirms underneath her, desperately trying to get friction under Agatha's thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How do you like to be touched?" Agatha asks, more direct, placing her palm on Rio's cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes Rio a second, catching her breath, then she murmurs, "Whatever you— you want, querida. <em>Anything."</em> She says, stammering.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha drops her head down to mouth at Rio's neck, her free hand settling on her inner thigh. "Tell me if you want to stop." She says, licking a hot, wet line from the crook of Rio's neck to her pulsepoint.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can answer, Agatha pushes her underwear out of the way and slides a finger through her folds, gasping at the wetness immediately coating her finger. Simultaneous to pushing said finger inside of her, Agatha nips and sucks a deep red mark into the side of Rio's neck, just underneath her jawline.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, Agatha—" She chokes out a moan as Agatha curls her finger, perfectly hitting that spot inside her with the first attempt. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>And she thought Agatha couldn't get even more perfect.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio arches her back up into Agatha, one hand on the back of her head and the other wrapped around her waist, keeping them as close together as possible. It doesn't take long before she gets impatient with the lack of contact— she pulls Agatha's hand away for a second, slides her underwear off and returns Agatha's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Small moans leave her lips when Agatha slips two fingers in this time and starts to thrust said fingers at a steady pace, the heel of her palm nudging her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That— just like that, don't—" She moans into the room, the only other sounds being Agatha's occasional whimpers and the sound of Rio's own wetness with every thrust. "Don't stop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha does quite the opposite. She keeps going, angling her hand just a little differently so that her thumb can press on Rio's clit, giving her more direct pleasure from it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my— <em>Agatha,"</em> Whatever she was going to say turns into a string of incoherent babbles and whines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel Rio clench around her fingers, her body tensing beneath her. "Are you going to come for me, sugar?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm—" Rio nods, "please, I'm so close."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead." She husks into her ear, nipping a little at the lobe, "I've got you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio comes undone seconds later, gripping Agatha with so much force she thinks for a moment that she's hurt her. But with the way Agatha guides her head closer, into a kiss, she realises it's the complete opposite.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You sound so beautiful when you come, sweetheart." Agatha says, laying on her side and practically dragging Rio with her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs with a smile, quickly kissing her lips, tucking her thigh between Agatha's legs. She feels Agatha's breath catch against her, and takes the initiative to guide her to lay on her back, climbing over her to straddle her hips. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She revels in the sensation of Agatha's hands moving over her, up her spine, in her hair, down to the back of her thighs. And then, Rio pulls away to simply take her in. She sits up, looking down at Agatha, who sits up on her elbows to be just a little closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans further, tucking her hands under the band of Rio's bra, tugging on it slightly, "Can I take this off?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, her mouth falling open and threatening to release a moan. She rests her hands at the nape of Agatha's neck, grazing her nails across it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Too distracted by Agatha's beautiful face infront of her, she doesn't process when her bra is gone until she feels Agatha's fingers, still wet from being inside Rio, tracing circles around her nipple. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck— fuck, cariño," She squeezes her eyes shut, exhaling deeply.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, her eyes shoot open when she feels Agatha trail kisses from her sternum down to the soft flesh of her breast, down to her nipple. Agatha's lips enclose around it, sucking gently and flicking at the hardened peak with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gets lost in it, she isn't sure how much time passes. Her hips are rocking slightly, hands in Agatha's hair, her grip varying with each sensation Agatha brings on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, she trails back up Rio's body, sucking a mark into the dip of her collarbone, licking over the length of it, before kissing and grazing her teeth up her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio needs her. Not for herself, no, she needs to know exactly how she can make Agatha feel. She needs to know what touches she likes, the best combinations, whether she prefers it rough or gentle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tugging on Agatha's hair, she leads her head up so that she can look her in the eye when she asks, "Any chance you have a strap hidden away in here somewhere?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can see Agatha's expression falter, her lips part and her eyebrows pull together a little. Rio tucks a stray lock of Agatha's hair behind her ear as she nods.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Over there," Agatha points to a chest of drawers behind Rio, "Bottom left."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gets up after giving Agatha's scalp a little massage, and hears the sigh of protest as Agatha leans back into the bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears a chuckle from across the room, and it causes her to become painfully aware of her own wetness and arousal between her legs. "What?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't tell me you have a whole <em>collection."</em> Rio turns around with an open-mouthed smile, raising an eyebrow before turning back around and asking, "Which do you want?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up, previously under the impression that <em>Rio wanted the strap in herself.</em> "Me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, for the wall." Rio huffs a laugh, "Yes, you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— uh— the— the green one." She stumbles over her words, letting herself fall onto her elbows again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches intently as Rio retrieves the harness, sliding it up to sit comfortably at her hips. She can't help but moan when Rio puts her hand between her own legs, collecting her wetness with a whine, and smothering it over the strap.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio circles around to the other side of the bed, climbing onto it and leaning against the velvety, cushioned headboard. "Come here." She beckons Agatha over with two fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't think she's ever moved this quickly in her life. She crawls over to Rio and sits over her thighs, involuntarily rocking against the strap. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's fingers lace tightly into Rio's hair, whose hand comes up to Agatha's face. Her fingers trail over the line of Agatha's nose, her cheekbones. Rio's middle finger traces over her lips, waiting until they part to slide her finger between them, into Agatha's mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So beautiful." Rio murmurs, just loud enough for Agatha to make out what she says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As an answer, Agatha sucks Rio's finger deeper into her mouth, closing her eyes with a whimper. She can somewhat hear Rio chuckle beneath her, and feels a hand on her lower back, encouraging her to roll her hips again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She does as Rio silently requests, causing the strap to nudge against Rio's clit. It doesn't take long for her to become more needy than she already is, groaning and letting Rio's finger drop from her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slides her underwear off, throwing them somewhere across the room, and places a hand on Rio's shoulders. She hovers over the strap, angling it correctly with her free hand. Just before she's about to lower herself down, she whines with the anticipation— or maybe it's the way Rio's stroking her hands up and down her spine. She isn't sure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a few moments, she basks in the care she's recieving from Rio, having never felt anything quite like it before. Sure, she and Wanda had had sex, multiple times, but it was never like this. Wanda had never felt inclined to fulfill Agatha's needs along with her own. She had only focused on herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was why she had, as Rio had called it, a <em>collection</em>. She needed to fulfill her needs one way or another. Rio's known her for barely a month and she's treating Agatha like the most important thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"May I?" Rio tilts her head up to look Agatha in the eye, grazing her fingers over the clasp of her bra.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods with an open mouth, not quite trusting herself to speak. Once she's completely bare, Rio utters a low <em>wow</em>, leaning forwards and brushing her lips over Agatha's chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That very action prompts Agatha to lower herself, letting the strap start to fill her. She has barely two inches inside of her when she husks, "Fuck, Ri, you feel so good—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her, biting her lip and kneading the flesh of her thighs, leaving her to set her own pace. She feels and watches Agatha lower herself more and more, until their hips make contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it, you're doing so good for me, amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>, did Rio <em>really</em> clock her praise kink that quickly? To make it worse, Agatha bites her lip and whimpers with Rio's words, leaning forwards to hide her face in the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of Rio's hands reaches up into Agatha's hair, scratching at her scalp, while the other stays firmly on her hip. She coaxes Agatha into moving, and when she does, her hands tightening around her shoulders, Rio murmurs a soft, "Good girl," into her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches, arching into Rio and groaning, <em>"Fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so wet." Rio breathes, reaching down to Agatha's thighs and collecting some of the slick coating her. She brings her fingers up and pushes them inside her own mouth, swirling her tongue around them with a moan to savour the taste.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha whines, lifting her head up and forcing Rio's fingers out of her mouth to kiss her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They moan into it, and Agatha keeps a hold of Rio's hand, intertwining their fingers and pinning it to the headboard, almost as an experiment. As she had hoped, Rio whimpers, gripping her hand and using her other to continue guiding Agatha's movements.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You f—feel so good." Agatha mumbles against her lips, nipping before swiping her tongue across it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hand on Agatha's hip shifts to collect more of the wetness coating her thighs, bringing the fingers up to circle her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah— <em>fuck</em>, keep— keep going, sugar," Agatha suddenly drops Rio's other hand, gripping her hair again with force into another kiss. Rio parts her lips and welcomes Agatha's tongue into her mouth, dancing with her own with a breathy mewl. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't take long until Agatha's movements become more frantic, her breathing becoming heavier. She pulls back, letting her head fall back down onto Rio's shoulder, keeping a firm hold in her hair. Her moans become a little louder, higher pitched.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, I— <em>God</em>, I'm—" She can't get the entire sentence out, cutting it short with another moan, nails digging into the flesh of Rio's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm, keep going, baby." The pet name slips out by accident, but she doesn't regret it when she feels Agatha's body tense against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha comes with a low moan, with the occasional squeak as the toy brushes that spot inside of her, as she slows her movements.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Holy shit," Rio breathes, "you're.."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha half-groans, half-laughs into Rio's shoulder, pressing a few light kisses to the skin, red from the force of her grip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"..incredible." Rio finishes, kissing the softness of Agatha's hair next to her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She leans up upon hearing Rio's voice so honest and unexpectedly tender, and cups her cheeks. Her brows have knitted together, partly from the pleasure of still having Rio <em>deep inside her,</em> and partly from the gentleness of Rio's words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, without wasting another second, Agatha captures Rio's lips in a kiss, her thumb stroking over her cheeks. It has the intimacy of lovers who've spent years of their lives together, but somehow, for Agatha and Rio, it's perfect. It feels right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After a few moments, Agatha leans back just a little, breaking the kiss and resting her forehead on Rio's. She moves a hand to Rio's shoulder for leverage, lifting herself off of the strap and whimpering at the sudden feeling of emptiness. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But she stays straddling Rio's lap as she runs her hands up and down her arms, squeezing gently at her upper arms and wrists.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not done with you." She whispers, her breath hot against Rio's lips, "But give me a minute."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A smug smile plays on Rio's lips, "Oh, yeah? That good, huh?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't flatter yourself, you were mediocre at best." The curl at the ends of her lips betrays her fake annoyance, pulling Rio close again for another kiss. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So mediocre that you <em>need a minute?"</em> She chuckles, playfully pinching Agatha's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh, playfully shoving her, "Shut up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They drift into a comfortable silence, simply relaxed by eachother's presence. Rio's fingers trace lines over Agatha's face, over her nose, her cheekbones. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, <em>far</em> too intimate for people that have barely known eachother a month. But <em>again</em>, it sort of feels right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand slowly stops, cupping Agatha's jaw with her thumb pulling her lower lip down, grazing over the skin, still damp from the saliva of their kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So.." Rio starts, glancing up at Agatha and tugging her hair a little with her other hand, "this is, like, <em>definitely</em> not just sex, right?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, seriously?" Agatha chuckles, "I mean, don't get me wrong, it's <em>amazing</em> sex, but..I want all of it. All of you." Her last words are spoken softer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods a little, her cheeks flushing slightly, but she doesn't say anything. She just looks down over Agatha's body, ontop of hers. Agatha feels a need to keep talking, to make it completely clear that she's sure about this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I told my therapist about you." She finds herself blurting out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— wait, what? You go to therapy?" Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tuesday mornings. It was.." She laughs awkwardly, regretting bringing it up entirely, "you had only cooked for me once. I asked him how long after a divorce would it be okay to start dating again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because you.." She trails off, scratching lightly at the nape of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to date you, Rio. I want to..take you out for dinner, or—or whatever you'd want." She inhales sharply, "I..I wanted to actually <em>talk to you</em>, and I was going to, but I freaked out. Never been good at..that. But after you told me about your ex, I figured that was your way of telling me you want more than sex." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Rio nods, her brows knitting together, "but you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I kept flirting because that was <em>my</em> way of telling you that I felt the same." She smiles, "And this whole..<em>thing</em> has made me come to the conclusion that we <em>both</em> need to work on our communication skills."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, wrapping an arm around her waist. "I'm still sorry for the—..ignoring you." She says quietly, "I freaked out."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Agatha nods. "I still want to take you out, though."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" She chews on her lip, her eyes lighting up a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How about..Tuesday? Six o'clock?" She offers, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. But I need you to promise me something first."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Anything." Agatha nods, reaching up and tucking some stray hair behind Rio's ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Any time I cook for you, and that includes tonight, you can <em>not</em> pay me." She says firmly, with no room for argument.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"..Fine." She begrudgingly agrees, "What about gifts? Or is any sort of money spent on you off the table?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You can get me gifts. Whatever you want, just...let me cook for you without it being a job."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha responds at first by just kissing away a forming droplet of sweat from Rio's forehead, then says, "Deal."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The flowers were cute, by the way." Rio adds suddenly, looking up at Agatha, surprising even herself. "Incase..you were wondering."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha's voice is quiet. Tentative.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's voice is a little hesitant, but honest, when she says, "Sweetest thing anyone's done for me." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's lips part, as if she's going to say something, but when no sound comes, Rio tilts her head to find Agatha's lips, and presses them against her own. She sighs into the kiss, feeling a spike of heat between her legs when she has the sensation of Agatha humming into it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her thighs press together, placing a hand on Agatha's sternum to hold her back for a second. Rio takes quick notice of the way Agatha's eyes are drooped, her cheeks flushed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Taken your minute yet?" Rio asks with a surprisingly soft smile, having intended it to be more of a teasing remark.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Getting impatient, sweetheart?" As per usual, Agatha doesn't fail to hit the teasing lilts in her tone, guiding Rio's hands down to cup her breast.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches, keeping a hold as she leans forwards to mark Agatha's skin, sucking a deep bruise into the centre of her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want me?" Agatha holds Rio's face up to look at her, her eyebrows pulled together in question.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio only nods with an open mouth, barely trusting herself to do anything else with the way Agatha's looking at her. Like she's the only thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Words, honey." She quietly commands, pulling Rio's face a little closer to her own.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inspects the way Rio's tongue comes out to wet her lips, the way her jaw tenses with arousal, the simple look of desire in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes," Rio says, barely above a whisper. "I want you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I suggest you prove it, then, sweetheart."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio does. Over and over and <em>over</em> and over again. She has Agatha sitting on her face, she takes her from behind, up against the wall, against the desk. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha insists to take care of Rio between recovering from an orgasm, or two consecutive if Rio had been particularly desperate to hear and see and feel her come undone. But Agatha had this incredibly insistent charm, one which Rio had often complained about. So, Agatha took care of her, even if it was just having Rio ride her fingers, her thigh, her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't sure how long they've been at it. She just knows that <em>this</em> is somehow what she's been looking for. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She wants Agatha. She knows she does, she's known for weeks. But to have her like this? To be the only person to get to make her feel this way, to see her in that blissful state of pleasure— Rio doesn't want to lose it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sure, she doesn't know Agatha particularly well, but they've shared certain things with eachother that they've not shared with more than one other person. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even the press doesn't know <em>Agatha Harkness</em> goes to therapy. They don't know about Agatha's parents. But <em>Rio</em> does, even if it isn't every detail. And Rio imagines that must mean Agatha trusts her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That night, Rio cooks them both dinner. She had needed to go back to her place for a mere five minutes, which Agatha had pressed would be a whole <em>half hour</em> without seeing her with the car journey added in. So, Rio eventually gave in with a mocking sigh and offered for Agatha to join her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They were back at Agatha's an hour later. Rio had practically pulled Agatha away from her actual house, taking her straight back to the greenhouse to save a tour. She had managed the whole collecting ingredients for dinner in about five minutes, as she had promised Agatha. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Except, when Agatha had held her up against the glass of the greenhouse, claiming how much she wanted her, she couldn't resist it. Yeah, the walls were glass, but she was in the privacy of her garden, surrounded by a fence. More or less.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cooking goes smoothly. Rio somehow manages to resist all of Agatha's little invitations, even when she's resorted to more or less pinning her to the counter to kiss her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha—" She chuckles, tugging Agatha's hair back to attempt at getting her full attention. "I need to cook. Don't you want dinner?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're the dinner." She practically growls it, not taking her eyes off of Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mm, smooth." She shakes her head with a laugh, "Come on, if you just sit back and look pretty while I cook, I'll give you the time of your life the next time I see you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visibly reluctantly, Agatha takes a small step back, and a few more until she's leaning against the counter, like she always used to. "You make..a compelling argument."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Rio even dares to throw her a wink, biting her lip before turning back to the pot on the stove. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She almost laughs hearing Agatha take a strong step towards her, but she keeps her voice steady as she holds a hand up. Agatha instantly stops, from what Rio hears. <em>Interesting</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to be good for me or do I need to resort to tying you down?" As she says it, she turns around, her eyes narrow, still holding the spoon she was stirring the sauce with.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's jaw has dropped, "I—" Her words catch in her throat, so she just crosses her arms with a huff, looking away in an attempt to deter Rio's attention from the growing blush on her neck and face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's what I thought." She chuckles again, almost curelly, and turns back to the food, pretending as if nothing had happened.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They eat in almost perfect silence, the occasional overdramatic moan from Agatha's side of the table, followed by Rio complaining that she <em>can't keep making those sounds,</em> and that being followed by Agatha arguing that she <em>can't help that the food is so good.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They clear up together, and while it wasn't much different to the other times Rio would stay for dinner, it <em>felt</em> different. The unspoken decrease in tension, but somehow an increase at the same time- the way they'd try to catch glances at eachother when they thought the other wasn't looking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's just about finished up, when a thought from earlier crosses her mind, "I swear to God, Agatha, if you pay me—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What are you gonna do?" Agatha chuckles, drying off her hands and taking a step infront of Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You'll regret it." She says quietly, an open threat, stepping closer to her and reaching a hand up to curl into her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I don't think I will, honey."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's other hand comes down to Agatha's hip, guiding her to lean against the counter. She yanks Agatha closer, kissing her with enough force to bring a muffled moan from her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Quickly, Agatha curls her hands into the fabric of Rio's collar, holding her back for a second to say, "Stay tonight, will you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Always, cariño." Rio whispers her reply, leaning back in to lock their lips again. </p>

<p>If you had told Rio she'd be waking up in hot rich MILF Agatha Harkness' bed not even a month after meeting her, she'd have said you were crazy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But here Rio is, enveloped in a soft, deep purple duvet with said hot rich MILF curled into her, an arm around her waist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her phone is on the bedside table.

<em>Jan 26, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Al: wtf happened??</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: either you fucked or one of you is dead. which is it</p><p>
<em>9:23am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes another gaze at Agatha, before typing up a one handed response, not wanting to take her hand from Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>R: i'm currently in her bed and she's sleeping right next to me</p><p>
<em>9:24am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>R: does that answer ur question??</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: holy shit!!!!!</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>R: okay relaxxx it's not that big of a deal</p><p>
<em>9:25am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help but allow the smile tugging on her lips to spread, her hand now absentmindedly stroking Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: yes it is!!!</p><p>
<em>9:26am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: you have to tell me everything. and i mean everything</p><p>

<em>9:27am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: yes ofc, go tend to sleeping beauty over there</p><p>
<em>9:27am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio shuts her phone off and lays it back on the bedside table, leaning a little closer to Agatha just to hold her. She lets her eyes fall shut, just resting them, as she hyper focuses on the feeling of Agatha's hot, steady breath fanning over her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, sugar," Rio would recognise that voice anywhere. She shuffles around in the bed, suddenly becoming aware of the fact that she's in a different position she was in a minute ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart, wake up," Agatha's voice again, this time paired with a hand gently shaking her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her eyes with a dramatic sigh, even if it's only to murmur, "What time is it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Eleven," Agatha tilts her head to the side with a smile, "and while I adore watching you sleep, I'm starving."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, finally properly processing what's going on as the effects of sleep wear away. Agatha's leaning over her, propped up on one elbow. Her other hand is in Rio's hair, while one of her legs is swung over Rio's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is this you subtly saying you'd like me to make us breakfast?" Rio asks, curling her hands round the back of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's smile stays as she says, "I'll see what I can do." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>What Rio can do</em> turns out to be bacon, eggs and pancakes. Agatha's lucky she had everything handy already, otherwise it may have just been a simple bowl of cereal from the cupboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows how much all of the cooking means to Agatha, even if she won't admit it just yet. She also knows how badly Agatha still wants to pay her for it, saying how she <em>deserves it</em> and how<em> she's the best in the state.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After eating, they spend another few hours together, this time wrapped under a blanket infront of the TV. They had fallen into some documentary, hardly paying attention but happy to be with eachother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha even tells her a little about Wanda, and how the divorce actually came long. How they had been drifting for years and the cheating was Agatha's breaking point.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's peaceful, really. That is, until Rio's phone buzzes angrily on the coffee table. She leans forwards with a sigh and picks it up, then leans back into Agatha to check it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Al: sooo when are we meeting??</p><p>
<em>1:53pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shit." Rio groans, dropping her phone onto the sofa beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio ends up leaving Agatha's house an hour later, using the little energy she has left to stop herself from staying. Because finally, <em>finally</em>, they're going to be going on a date.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She meets Alice a whole five minutes later, deciding on just walking through town rather than going somewhere specific.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Alice points at Rio, "tell me everything."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I went over," She starts, "and she got me flowers. I went rambling about, y'know, the not just sex stuff, and she—" Rio huffs a laugh, "she called me <em>Ri</em> and then said that it isn't just sex for her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, that's adorable. What else does she call you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sugar, sweetheart." Rio shrugs, "But anyway, she said that she wants to take me on a date and that she wants all of it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And then..?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you think, Alice?" Rio sighs, narrowing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh. <em>Oh</em>, right. So, went well?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." She says, "Thank you for..talking some sense into me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's nothing." Alice shrugs, "But I'm happy for you. When's the date?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tuesday. She told me to come over, then it's a surprise from there."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The rest of their time together is more or less Alice trying to get anything at all out of Rio about how the sex was. She finally backs down after Rio says a single word: <em>mind-blowing</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tuesday seems to take forever to come round. Rio spends a good hour trying to figure out what Agatha could be planning for their date. She doesn't want to be underdressed, or <em>overdressed</em> either. Though, she isn't sure she'd be able to <em>be</em> overdressed with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 28, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ri: heyy so like what's the dress code for tonight?? x</p><p>
<em>5:23pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There. She sits back on her bed and stares at her wardrobe, awaiting a reply. Which comes much sooner than Rio had anticipated.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Perfect timing - go open your front door, sugar x</p><p>
<em>5:24pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Confused, Rio stands up and throws on a quick hoodie and pair of jeans so she's more presentable than <em>lingerie</em> incase there's someone outside. She jogs downstairs, giving her plants a quick brush of her fingers before she opens the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the porch lays a box, black with a purple ribbon. Rio sighs with a smile, pulling it inside and shutting the door again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Jesus, Agatha," She chuckles to herself, taking a hold of the handwritten note tied to the ribbon:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>'Incase you needed anything for tonight. If not, keep it anyway x</p><p> </p><p>Yours,</p><p>Agatha'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She bites at her lip with a mixture of adoration and anticipation, taking the box back upstairs. After taking the note and tucking it away in her 'important things' draw, she lays the box on the bed and unties the ribbon. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's soft, probably silk, and feels incredibly expensive. When it's off, she tucks that away too. And finally, she opens the box.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Inside is a forest green, silk, long-sleeved blouse. She touches it and her breath hitches at just the feel of it. She takes it out and lays it carefully on the bed— it's probably worth triple her pay check. Underneath is a pair of smart black trousers, and underneath that is a black tie with small green accents.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio rushes to put the outfit on, it's the sort of thing she would've picked out for herself if she had reason to wear these sorts of things. And Agatha had chosen exceptionally well. It looks perfect.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She leaves the top two buttons undone, ties the tie relatively loosely, but not too loose to come undone. Before going downstairs to leave, she gets her phone and sees a message from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Do you like it?</p><p>
<em>5:27pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: holy fuck</p><p>
<em>5:29pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Is that a yes?</p><p>
<em>5:29pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: obviously. thank you x</p><p>
<em>5:30pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Perfect.</p><p>
<em>5:31pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gets to Agatha's at about nine minutes to six. She takes a slow walk up to her door before holding out a bouquet of dove orchids and purple roses, and knocks on the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha answers a few seconds later with a smile, quickly moving to the side and letting Rio in. She then sees the flowers, "Oh, these are stunning." She says, "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, "I'm just such a gentleman."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You really are," Agatha laughs lightly, taking the flowers into the kitchen to put them in a vase. When she returns, she overlooks Rio's outfit. "You look..<em>amazing</em>, Ri." She brushes her fingertips against the fabric of the shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes that as her chance to shamelessly stare at Agatha, her <em>date</em>, and look at the white shirt, black oversized blazer and trousers, "As do you." Rio replies, pushing her hands into her pockets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha slips on her shoes with a smile, and says, "Shall we?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her arm, walking through town being just illuminated by the streetlights above them. Each time they pass under one, she looks over at Agatha just in time to see the light glow perfectly over her features.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They pass over a bridge, and stop for a moment to look over the water. The moon's reflection in it, the ripples in the current of the river.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans on the wall of the bridge, her hold drifting from Agatha's arm to her hand. She laces their fingers together, relishing in the warmth of Agatha's skin, trying to resist a shiver.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Here," Agatha takes a step back for a moment and shrugs her blazer off, swinging it over Rio's shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Won't you be cold?" Rio asks, tugging Agatha's blazer around her body.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll be fine, sugar." She smiles and leans back on the wall of the bridge again, taking Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well. This is a surprise, Agatha." A sharp voice sounds from behind them, and Rio feels Agatha tense beside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanda." She says, not even turning around.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who is <em>this?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is that really your business anymore?" She sighs, turning around and keeping a firm hold of Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio follows, getting a good look at Wanda before squeezing Agatha's hand in silent reassurance. She has to admit, Wanda's beautiful. A horrible person to Agatha, but beautiful nonetheless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course it is. It's been two and a half months, Agatha, what the hell is wrong with you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio cuts in, "I'm sorry, why are you still here exactly? We're clearly busy." She releases Agatha's hand and wraps her arm around her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, she's not worth it." Agatha murmurs, "Let's go to dinner."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, wait—" Wanda laughs mockingly. <em>"You're</em> Rio?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's brows knit together, "How do you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Nicky."</em> Wanda cuts her off. "Fuck, Agatha, twelve years down the fucking drain for your fucking <em>chef?"</em> She scoffs, "Or should I say <em>fucking</em> your chef?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you seriously complaining that Agatha's seeing someone? You don't own her." Rio takes a step forward.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you do?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her voice raises a little, "No, no one <em>owns</em> her." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sugar, come on," Agatha places a hand at the nape of her neck, scratching lightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And while Rio turns to her, it doesn't mean she forgets Wanda's there, "No, she—" Rio looks back at Wanda, "you're being fucking ridiculous."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda frowns angrily, "Excuse me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You have <em>no</em> fucking right to complain that Agatha's seeing someone when you <em>cheated on her."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that's rich." Wanda chuckles, shaking her head, though Rio doesn't let her speak any more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"You're</em> the one who put twelve years down the drain, or whatever the fuck it is you said." She huffs, taking a step back. "Agatha did nothing wrong."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Beside her, Agatha's just openly watching her, her lips parted and eyebrows raised.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I suggest you leave us to our <em>date."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hesitantly, Wanda turns away and leaves, mumbling some hurtful words as she does so. There's a moment of silence, and for a few seconds of said moment, Rio wonders that she's done the wrong thing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But instead, when she looks at Agatha— her lip caught between her teeth, her eyes half-lidded— Rio's breath hitches.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hand comes up before Rio's question is out, pulling her in by her tie into a kiss. Rio's words become a muffled mewl beneath Agatha's lips, her lips parting with a gasp. Agatha's tongue welcomes itself into Rio's mouth, pressing to the roof of her mouth before pulling away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Everything disappears around them, all Rio knows is Agatha. She stares at her for a moment, dazed, before finding her words, "So..you <em>are</em> okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart, you have no idea how attractive that was." She husks against her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly closes the distance, kissing her, before saying, "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Let's go back." She nods quickly, already starting to walk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What about dinner?" Except Rio isn't actually complaining, she lets Agatha pull her along by her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She shrugs, "We can reschedule, order something in. Besides, I have bigger priorities." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And what are these priorities of yours?" Rio asks, smirking and quickening her pace a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You, of course."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The very second they're both inside Agatha's house, Rio's shoved into the door, closing it with the force. Agatha's hands grip her hair, just to move down her body to her hips and back up again to the back of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to keep <em>staring and thinking</em> or are you going to kiss me?" Rio whispers, gripping Agatha's waist and pulling their bodies close together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hardly waits until all of her words are out, tugging Rio closer by her hair, stopping when their lips brush ever so slightly together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you know how fucking gorgeous you are?" She husks, holding Rio close but with a hold firm enough to not let her close the distance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums, tilting her head a little, "Not sure. Maybe you need to remind me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slides a hand down, untucking her shirt and dragging her nails over her skin. "I would do that <em>every single day</em> if you asked."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As her breath hitches, Rio's eyes slip shut and for a moment, she wonders how serious Agatha is. Whether she really wants this to be long term, ideally <em>forever</em>. Rio doesn't want it to end, doesn't want <em>Agatha</em> to end. She'd miss it— <em>her</em> far too much.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Is what she settles on instead, her voice breathy and desperate.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your hair," Agatha combs through it to make her point, "your eyes, your mouth," She nips at Rio's bottom lip, "that gap between your teeth— fucking adorable."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Kiss me." Rio breathes, trying to push through Agatha's death grip on her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Let me look at you, sugar." She murmurs, her free hand cupping Rio's cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha." Rio practically whines, her head thudding against the door. "Agatha, cariño, come on, let me kiss you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Agatha places a finger over her lips, slowly parting them and sliding it inside.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, her eyes fluttering closed and her legs practically falling weak against the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"See?" Agatha says, her breath warm against Rio's skin, "You're so beautiful." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She teasingly brings her finger to the rim of Rio's lips, just millimetres from pulling out, only to push it deeper again. It's like that until Rio's such a mess that she's hardly moving and letting Agatha do whatever she pleases.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Agatha pulls her finger out completely, both hands coming up to cup her face. Rio's attention is fully on Agatha's lips, the anticipation threatening to kill her as Agatha moves closer, slowly, stopping just short of a kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio's voice trembles, "please, please, <em>please—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That seems to be enough for Agatha, who tugs Rio into a kiss by her tie. She pulls her off of the wall, walking them backwards through the hallway. Rio holds Agatha's waist like her life depends on it, one of her hands hovering behind her back. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She feels a wall brushing her fingers, and shoves Agatha against it with an unexpected dominance. Catching Agatha's startled yelp in her mouth, Rio reaches up and tugs at Agatha's shirt, eagerly undoing the buttons from the top down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck— right here?" Agatha breathes, "Can't you wait until you've gotten me—" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans down and presses an open-mouthed kiss to the soft skin just below her ear, teasing with her tongue before sucking a mark into the skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—up—upstairs?" Agatha breathlessly finishes her sentence, though she holds Rio close, a hand in her hair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just as quickly as it had started, Rio takes a step back, leaving Agatha a needy mess, chest heaving, against the wall.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go on," Rio says, gesturing to the stairs, her other hand on her own hip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes herself off of the wall, her unbuttoned shirt falling down to the floor now that it has nothing holding it up. It reveals half of the deep purple set she had decided on for that night, and it completely takes Rio's attention.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Using the distraction to her advantage, Agatha takes a hold on Rio's tie once more, and starts to head upstairs. Rio's being dragged along behind her, like a dog on a leash, and not using an ounce of her breath to argue with it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once they're in the confines of Agatha's room, Rio's pulled forwards into a pair of firm hands, vigorously unbuttoning the silk shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So fucking beautiful." Are the first words out of Agatha's mouth when Rio's shirt and tie drops to the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then takes a step closer, and they both make quick work of removing eachother's trousers, leaving them in a pile to develop countless creases.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Placing a hand on her sternum, Rio slowly guides Agatha backwards until she's sat on the edge of the bed. She follows, settling in Agatha's lap, with her hand remaining on her chest. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her heart is beating fast— insanely fast, and when Rio looks her in the eye, all she can see is want. No— <em>need</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She slides both hands up to Agatha's hair, digging her hands in and lightly massaging her scalp before leaning forwards and kissing her. She catches Agatha's bottom lip between her teeth, dragging it out a little to hear her groan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's nails dig into the skin of Rio's hips, leaving little half-moons in their wake. She continuously tries to pull her closer and closer, all while their tongues move together as if choreographed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio's tugged so close that they fall back onto the bed, and Agatha's forced to sit up on her elbows to slide backwards so she's more central.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio crawls over her, shifting so that Agatha's legs are able to wrap around her waist, which Agatha doesn't hesitate to do. She has Rio as close as possibly without actually being <em>inside her</em>, and— </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, I want— I need to be inside you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Be my guest," She chuckles softly with a genuine smile, taking Agatha's hand and guiding it between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"With the <em>strap</em>, sweetheart." She clarifies, practically whining her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>. Yeah— yes, please." She nods quickly, sitting up and allowing Agatha to sit up with her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go get whichever you'd like." She pushes her gently by the shoulders, nodding towards the chest of drawers that Rio's already perfectly familiar with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio comes back, running a hand through her hair and holding the strap— what Agatha <em>assumes</em> is the strap— behind her back, she chews at her lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her hand out, raising her eyebrows as if to say <em>go on.</em> Rio gets the message, taking the strap from behind her back and placing it in Agatha's hands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes widen— not only had Rio chosen the longest out of the drawer, but it's also the thickest. She glances up at Rio, "Will this be okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Yes. Please."</em> It's hushed, almost a whisper, and it's said somewhat nervously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Agatha nods, standing up to get herself ready, but not before kissing Rio and instructing against her lips, "Go get comfortable."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches in anticipation, laying down in the centre of the bed with her head resting upon the dozens of pillows. She decides to also save a little of Agatha's time and removes her bra and underwear, leaving her bare on the duvet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she looks back over to Agatha, she's completely bare, just tightening the last bit of the harness to her liking, staring right at Rio as she does it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha climbs onto the bed and ontop of Rio, propping herself up with one hand while the other falls between Rio's legs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, honey, I'm getting there." She coos, gliding her lips over Rio's collarbones as she slides a finger into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It goes in easily, so she adds another, then <em>another</em>, getting almost completely lost in the little gasps Rio makes. She leaves her fingers to sit for a moment, curling a little before pulling out and smothering the wetness over the strap.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you ready?" She asks, lining it up to Rio's entrance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." She whispers, her legs curling around Agatha's waist, while her hands cup either side of her jaw.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's head drops to rest on Rio's sternum as she starts to slide inside of her, slowly as to not overwhelm her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She gets to, as a guess, two thirds of the way, before Rio chokes out, "Wait,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm," She whimpers, moving her hands down to Agatha's hips to stop her from pulling out, "just— just need a second."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, sugar." She murmurs softly, stroking a hand through Rio's hair and kissing across the column of her neck. Agatha can feel Rio's body relax a little beneath her, but she waits until—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, you— carry on," Rio breathes, then adds quietly, <em>"please."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Keeping the pace slow, Agatha does as asked, pushing the remaining length inside until she bottoms out. The moment their skin comes into contact, they groan. Agatha leans up and crashes her lips into Rio's in a wet kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She gives Rio a few moments of stillness, allowing her to adjust fully before starting to move. And Agatha really doubts she'll ever forget the moment that she <em>does</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio arches into her, her nails digging into her back as she moans into Agatha's lips. Her hips meet Agatha's gentle thrusts, squeezing her eyes shut with the pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want me to stay slow?" She asks, and it's as if they've both forgotten the possessive and protective mess that got them here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"At first." Rio sighs a moan, her head dropping back fully against the pillows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It reveals that neck of hers, one of the many things about her that Agatha can't resist. She simply stares for a few thrusts, watching the movement of each swallow, each bob of her throat. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her temptation gets the better of her, and she leans closer to stroke her tongue up Rio's throat, ending with a small flick of it at the underside of her jaw. Then, she tilts Rio's head down and meets her in a kiss— tongue and teeth and lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The angle of Agatha's thrusts shifts a little, allowing for the base of the toy to lay pressure on her clit with each thrust. Despite the burning need simmering in her lower stomach, she keeps her movements slow and steady, for Rio's benefit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rests her head in the crook of Rio's neck, grazing across it with her lips and teeth, nipping the skin every now and then.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hands on Agatha's hips tighten their grip before sliding up her spine and settling in her hair. Their soft moans and gasps fill the room as Rio tugs on Agatha's hair, pulling her so their eyes meet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You can— you can go faster." She whimpers, moving her hands round to hold Agatha by the back of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha complies to Rio's request, the pressure against her clit becomes just enough, causing her to drop her head into Rio's neck again, releasing those breathy little sounds into her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, <em>God</em>, Agatha—" Rio's cut off by her own moan, dragging her nails down Agatha's back until she finds her hips. "M—more, I need—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha complies once again, thrusting deeper into her, just a little faster than before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>— are you— are you close?" Rio questions, listening closely to the way Agatha's moans are becoming pitchier, less controlled, and feeling the thrusts becoming more uneven.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods into her shoulder with another gasp, practically panting into her ear with her need.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep— keep going, I want you to— <em>fuck</em>, I want you to come inside me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's words bring out a much more desperate moan than Agatha would ever like to admit, and she hears and feels the signs that Rio's release is getting nearer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Ri—</em> sugar, I—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't stop." Rio says firmly, "Don't—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, Rio, you feel s—so good," </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath catches in her throat, groaning as the toy hits just the perfect spots inside of her. It quickly drives her to her climax, reinforcing her leg's grip around Agatha's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Simply the sensation of having Rio fall apart beneath her pushes Agatha over the edge, having not even been properly touched. Agatha fucks her through it, allowing them both to ride out their highs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she's sure their aftershocks have ebbed away, she slows her thrusts to a stop, catching her breath while placing delicate kisses across Rio's shoulder and neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They stay like that for a moment, Rio's hands combing through Agatha's hair and occasionally rolling her hips with the strap still deep inside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then moves a hand to Agatha's shoulder, skillfully pushing her to lay down, bringing a surprised yelp from her. Keeping the strap inside, she straddles Agatha's hips and takes a hold of her wrists, pinning them above her head. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's legs are squriming and rubbing together beneath her, struggling against Rio's hold on her wrists. Instead of releasing her in any way, Rio leans over her and locks their lips, shifting Agatha's wrists so she can hold them down with a single hand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's other hand comes to rest around Agatha's throat, without actually putting any pressure on it. Gasping into the kiss, Agatha arches into Rio's touch involuntarily. She slips her tongue into Rio's mouth, moaning when it's sucked deeper. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After Rio breaks the kiss, she looks over Agatha's face— her dilated pupils, flushed cheeks, lips wet with saliva. She delicately removes her hand from Agatha's wrists, sliding the hand down to match the other on her neck. Giving it a small, gentle squeeze, she watches the way Agatha's mouth falls open with a whimper, before sliding them over Agatha's breasts, down her sides, and up again to her shoulders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking her sweet time, she lifts herself off of the strap, whining at the loss of feeling full. She then sits up on Agatha's thighs, delighting in the way Agatha follows the movement and sits up on her elbows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Curling her hands more around Agatha's shoulders, Rio pulls her to sit up straight, right into a kiss. It's deep and slow, leaving them both breathless by the time they break apart. Rio dips her head down to pepper kisses over Agatha's sternum, pushing her back to lay on the bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once she seems comfortable enough, Rio lowers herself, kissing through the valley between Agatha's breasts, grazing her teeth over the skin, down to her stomach. She then comes face-to-face with the toy that was inside her minutes ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She locks her gaze to Agatha's, keeping heated eye contact as she inches close enough to slide her tongue over the length of it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck,</em>" Agatha breathes, sitting back up on her elbows so she has a better view of the way Rio's tongue is moving. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She licks up the entire length again, moaning at the taste of herself and gripping Agatha's hips as she does so. Agatha has a strong hold in the duvet, resisting the urge to hold Rio by the hair and guide her every movement. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To make said urge even <em>harder</em> to resist, Rio envelops the strap into her mouth, having it reach deeper each time she sucks it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio's attention flickers to the way Agatha's purely white-knuckling the fabric of the duvet, clearly itching to hold onto a part of Rio. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She fails to fight a smirk as she takes a hold of Agatha's hands and pulls— firstly forcing her to lay back down, but secondly to place those hands in Rio's hair, encouraging Agatha to guide her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Biting her lip, shuddering, Agatha grips and holds Rio's hair back, controlling each time the strap disappears inside her mouth. Her breath hitches when the head of the toy knocks the back of Rio's throat, bringing a gag from her. The contact results in it nudging against her already sensitive clit, drawing a whimper from her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With that, Agatha pulls Rio off of the strap and makes an effort to not show how affected she is by the needy whine of protest she gets in return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Momentarily taking her hands out of Rio's hair, she tugs on the harness around her hips, "Be a dear and take this off for me, will you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instantly, Rio licks her lips and loosens the harness, eagerly pulling it down Agatha's legs and dropping it onto the end of the bed. Then, her gaze falls between Agatha's legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's so <em>visibly wet</em>, her inner thighs glistening with her slick. "Are—" Rio's breath catches, hesitating to ask, "Are you always <em>this wet</em> during sex?" Though her voice shows a lilt of admiration.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs a soft, genuine laugh, and places her hands back in Rio's hair, "No, sweetheart." She says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's all for— for me?" She looks up at Agatha before reaching a hand out and gliding a finger through her folds. "You're <em>dripping."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"All for you, Ri." Agatha replies, putting a little pressure on the back of her head, "I need you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You have me." Rio says, lifting Agatha's thighs up so that they rest on her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio— sugar, please," Her words are quiet, though she tugs at Rio's hair again to make her point.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lays her tongue flat and licks up Agatha's core, flicking it against her clit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, oh my God, Rio—" Her back arches instantly into Rio's touch. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trailing back down, she slips her tongue inside, groaning at the wetness that coats it. The way Agatha's hold in her hair gets stronger and the way her chest is heaving prompts her to thrust her tongue a few times.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was the right choice— Agatha's mouth falls open with a moan, pushing Rio a little deeper inside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then feels the familiar need to hear and feel everything that she can possibly do to Agatha, so she shifts her arm around, and removes her tongue, replacing it with two fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She glances up at Agatha, who's watching her while chewing at her lip, her brows pulled together. And then, she dips her head again, enclosing Agatha's clit between her lips and gently sucking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Right— right <em>there</em>, don't stop," She sighs a moan, letting her head drop back fully onto the pillows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tugs Agatha closer, tracing quick circles with her tongue and gently grazing her teeth across her clit. She curls her fingers in time with her mouth, hitting Agatha's sweet spot <em>just right.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, honey—" She chokes out a moan, feeling the heat coil deep in her stomach, building much quicker than she's used to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can hear that she's close, feel it, sense it. She puts more pressure behind her tongue and mouth, while driving her fingers faster into Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She whines, tugging Rio impossibly closer, "Sugar, Ri, I'm—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And <em>that's</em> when it happens. She feels and hears Agatha come beneath her, yes, but she also feels a sudden rush of wetness on her hand. She whimpers into Agatha, realising what she's just made happen, and continues to fuck her through it, wanting to extract every last ounce of pleasure from her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breathing has evened out a little, and her body's relaxed, and Rio takes that as her sign to gently lap up every bit of wetness between Agatha's legs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She slowly kisses her way back up Agatha's body, and is about to press one to her lips, but is stopped by Agatha's hands covering her own face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha?" She kisses the back of her hand instead.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am <em>so</em> sorry, oh my God, I didn't even know I could...<em>do that."</em> She suddenly says, breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wait— what? Sorry for what, exactly?" Rio's eyebrows furrow, and she rests her hands over Agatha's wrists, silently asking her to lift them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she does, the expression Rio's met with is something she nevee thought she'd see on <em>Agatha Harkness</em>' face. Embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio has never been more confused in her thirty-two years of life. "What are you sorry for, cariño?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For—" She sighs, which turns very quickly into a groan, "For coming all over you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak, the corners of her lips tilted upwards, but Agatha keeps talking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I've— I've never done that before, I didn't know I <em>could."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, we're coming back to <em>that</em>, but why on Earth would you need to apologise for that?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's now Agatha's turn to look confused.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That might be the hottest thing that's <em>ever</em> happened to me." Rio clarifies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"...Seriously?" Agatha's hands curl around the back of Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah." Rio nods, quickly kissing Agatha before she continues, "It's one of my favourite things about the human body. And now one of my favourite things about <em>your</em> body."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha relaxes with each word Rio says, "What else?" She questions.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your nose." Rio says, "Your eyes. Your <em>hair, fuck</em>, your hair is incredible."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She chuckles, then pulls Rio down and guides her into a soft kiss, humming into it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks it off after a few slow seconds, then tucks a strand of Agatha's hair behind her ear, "So..you've <em>never</em> done that before?" She asks with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, shut up." Agatha does <em>not</em> mean it, not when Rio's voice has come to be one of her favourite things to listen to.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You sure I'm still <em>mediocre?"</em> She cradles Agatha's jaw with her hand, brushing her thumb over her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, fine, maybe a <em>little</em> better than mediocre." She sighs, shaking her head with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Only a little? Come on, surely the first girl to make you <em>squirt—"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut <em>up.</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"—should get more than <em>mediocre.</em>" Rio finishes her sentence with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, covering her face with her hands again, "You're not going to let this go, are you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, no, definitely not." Rio laughs softly, "I love the way your body reacts to me. To my touch." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches down and grazes her nails over Agatha's forearm as if to prove her point. And it does very well to do that, if the goosebumps that appear are anything to go by.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slides her hands off of her face, and when she sees the look of complete awe on Rio's, she reaches up and cups her cheeks. "I love it too," She says quietly, "and I love the way <em>your</em> body reacts to <em>my</em> touch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So do I." Rio whispers, brushing her lips against Agatha's before placing a firm kiss on them. They stay like that for a few moments, exploring almost every part of eachother, touching almost everything they can. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When their kisses slow to a near stop, Rio rolls over to lay beside Agatha, but she stays in contact with a leg swung over her waist. Agatha turns to face Rio properly, a hand landing naturally in her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She studies Rio's face, every little divot, little freckle, she attempts to memorise. And then she looks back up to Rio's eyes again, expecting them to be looking right back at her. But they're...closed?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, baby, you're falling asleep." Agatha mutters, stroking through her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're not exactly helping." Rio grumbles, burying her head into Agatha's neck, who huffs a gentle laugh at her response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"As much as I'd enjoy waking up to you in my bed tomorrow morning, I have work, so.. you won't be able to stay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just leans back and stares up at her with those big brown eyes of hers, subconsciously nipping at her bottom lip. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But..." Agatha murmurs, "I suppose I can be a little late. Or...take a sick day. It's <em>my</em> company, after all."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's the spirit." Rio's lips curl into a smile, nudging her gently with her elbow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We also need to eat." Agatha mentions, softly massaging Rio's scalp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whines in protest, "I already did." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you did a wonderful job, sweetheart." Agatha laughs softly, leaning down to press a kiss to her lips, "How about...we order food, shower, eat, and see where the night takes us?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs into her neck, "Yeah, okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, okay?" Agatha repeats, "That's it? No <em>five more minutes?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A shower with <em>Agatha Harkness herself</em> happens to be very convincing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio was right. They order their food, some Chinese take away, and Agatha leads her through to her en suite. It matches the bedroom, though rather than black, it's white. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Showering together has felt the most intimate out of everything they've done together, so much so that it threatens to bring Rio to tears while Agatha's rubbing shampoo into her hair. She forces them back, lets herself enjoy the moment. Rio will <em>not</em> be held back by fear, not this time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha's finished, she takes the shower head off the wall and rinses through Rio's hair. It's different to just standing under the water. The extra care, the details. <em>Fuck</em>, Rio wants every shower to be like this. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It feels like it's only been seconds when the warmth of the water is pulled from her head, and Agatha hangs the shower head back onto the wall. Then, Rio feels Agatha's hands in her hair again, working conditioner into it, untangling it as she goes. This might be the most care someones put into her in her life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And again, Agatha holds the shower head to rinse Rio's hair. It's almost silent, save for the occasional content hum or <em>turn around.</em> She watches as Agatha washes her body for her, taking care of her, guiding her underneath the water.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio returns each of the favours of course, muttering sweet phrases as she goes. Pressing a kiss to her lips beneath the water after telling her how gorgeous she is. Her movements— her caresses are slow and deliberate. Agatha deserves all the care in the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Strangely, eating Chinese take away with her— with <em>Agatha</em> is somehow as special as the countless times she's cooked dinner for her. It's nice to just curl up together, share eachother's body heat beneath a blanket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Where the night takes them</em> turns out to simply be Agatha's bed, laying together under the covers. Rio's laying with her front pressed to Agatha's back and both arms around her. Her face is buried in Agatha's hair, breathing in the smell of the shampoo from their shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri?" Agatha murmurs, and Rio would have missed it if not for how close she is to her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A gentle smile appears on Rio's face, "Yeah?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At first, Agatha just turns around in her arms, placing her hands on Rio's cheeks and interlocking their legs. Her thumbs rub over Rio's cheekbones, looking as Rio's eyes catch the light of the lamp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—I <em>really</em> like you." She says quietly, and keeps talking before Rio can respond, "You're so...easy to be with. And I can <em>not</em> get over how pretty you are."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio tightens her hold slightly, twisting her head to press a quick kiss to the palm of Agatha's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I haven't—" Her voice falters, and she avoids Rio's gaze for a moment before putting in the courage to look her in the eye when she says, "I haven't felt like this in a <em>long</em> time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak, to agree, to say something undoubtedly sweet, but Agatha beats her to it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And now that I have it, I'm— I'm scared to lose it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, I—I'm not going anywhere." Rio says, softly but firmly, "I haven't felt like this in a long time, either. And I really like <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs with a calm smile, relieved Rio feels the same. She lets Rio pull her closer, and she kisses her cheek before resting her head beneath Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Who knew you were such a softie when you aren't running that company of yours?" Rio muses, twirling pieces of Agatha's hair through her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She presses a tender kiss to Rio's collarbone, then breathes, "Only for you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry, I won't destroy your scary reputation." She says, then leans her head down and lands her lips on Agatha's hairline.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It feels like.." Agatha angles her head up again, looking at Rio properly, "like I've known you for years."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're taking the words right out of my mouth." Rio says, chuckling softly, "It feels like that for me, too. We've known eachother a month, but I—I'm so...comfortable. It feels familiar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums in agreement, leaning back into Rio's hold again. She's quiet, and her breathing starts to even out a little, so Rio assumes she's fallen asleep. So, Rio relaxes into her and lets her eyes fall shut, stroking her hair and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sugar?" Agatha's voice again, her breath warm against Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's coming to love the way Agatha gets in the evenings, "Yes, amor?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're free on Friday, aren't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." She nods, her nails grazing Agatha's scalp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—I have Nicky this from Friday to Monday, and I was hoping you could come over and cook? I know we agreed you don't work for me anymore but—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Agatha, I'll come over." Rio gently cuts off her rambling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? Oh, thank God." Agatha huffs a relieved laugh, "It's mainly for Nicky's benefit, y'know? He keeps talking about you and he'd be confused if suddenly...you were gone. But of course, <em>I</em> want you there, too."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Really, Agatha, it isn't a problem. You know I love cooking for you— <em>and</em> Nicky." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, sweetheart." She says quietly, nuzzling closer into Rio's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is Wanda going to drop him off?" Rio asks, unintentionally allowing the protective lilt of her voice to come through.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, at five." Agatha replies, drawing little shapes into the nape of Rio's neck as an attempt to comfort her. "I don't know if I said so earlier, but thank you for—for saying all of that. To Wanda, I mean."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, "Well, she was being a dick. You're welcome."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Agatha hums in agreement, feeling herself slowly drift to sleep. "She was."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can come over at eleven?" Rio suggests.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And we can go on a well deserved date?" Agatha continues, "One that <em>isn't</em> interrupted by my ex-wife."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio hums, "Yes, please." Her hands starting to stroke through Agatha's hair again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers softly, barely audibly, the arms wrapped around Rio's neck tightening a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Biting her lip, Rio chuckles, "You're like a cat." Gently working the small tangles out of her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I like it when you do that." Is Agatha's response, "Feels nice."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" She pulls Agatha to lay almost directly on top of her, their legs still interlocked.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." Agatha's head lays on Rio's chest, listening to the steady sound of her heartbeat. Her eyes flutter shut, still sounding the occasional hum with the sensation of Rio's hands in her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio assumes Agatha's fallen asleep, her hand slows it's movements in her hair, but the second she hears a whine of protest, she resumes with a light laugh. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She wouldn't even be able to guess how long she laid there, stroking Agatha's hair, listening to the hums from the back of her throat. Though, she carries on even when Agatha's asleep, until she falls herself.</p>

<p>Agatha wakes up on Friday with an hour and a half before Rio's due to come over. She usually wouldn't stay in bed this late unless someone— <em>Rio</em> was with her, and she needs time to get ready for their date.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She really should <em>not</em> have stayed on call with Rio up until two in the morning. Then again, making herself come with Rio doing the same on the other side of the phone, she didn't particularly want it to end. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans as she gets out of bed, running a hand through her hair and rubbing her eyes. After taking a sip of water, she drags her feet across the floor to the bathroom, turning the shower on. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she waits for it to heat up, she looks at herself in the mirror. She takes notice of the way her bottom lip is still a little swollen from the force at which she was biting it the night before. How messy her hair is— much more than usual. The fading marks on her neck from the last time she saw Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, her phone rings from the bedroom. She considers waiting to look until after her shower, but her curiosity gets the best of her and she steps back into her room, grabbing her phone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second she sees the name Ri on her screen, a smile blooms on her face. She answers it and holds it to her ear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Morning, honey." She says, walking back through to the bathroom. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can just about hear Rio hum from across the phone, and her brows furrow. "Is everything okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"You sent me more clothes."</em> She states, and the way she actually feels about that is unknown to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I did." Agatha says slowly, carefully. "Is that okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Mhm, fuck yeah, it's okay."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good." She sighs, relieved, and then another thought crosses her mind. A smirk plays on her lips, "Is that all you called me to say?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Maybe."</em> Rio huffs over the phone. <em>"Just— wanted to hear your voice."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We were on the phone for four hours last night, sweetheart. You heard a <em>lot</em> of my voice."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Yeah, and now I miss it. Problem?"</em> Rio chuckles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all, sugar. But listen, I need to shower— text me when you leave?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Okay,"</em> Rio's smile is audible, <em>"I'll see you soon, cariño."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"See you soon, love." And Agatha hangs up the phone before she can hear Rio's response to the name.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She knows Rio calls her <em>love</em> in Spanish, she isn't stupid. But this is different, somehow. More real. Scarier.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But, of course, Rio doesn't miss it. Her phone buzzes again as she sets it down, about to undress and shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jan 31, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ri: love?</p><p>
<em>9:52am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites at her lip, unsure of how to respond. She could just deny, deny, deny, but Rio's persistent. It won't get her anywhere. So, she does the next best thing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: You can't say much. You call me amor all the time.</p><p>
<em>9:53am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Easy enough. This time, she waits for Rio's next response. By now, she's wasted much more water than she usually does, but the simple words Rio types and sends her are worth it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: touché</p><p>
<em>9:53am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: but it's cute - i like it x</p><p>
<em>9:53am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Yeah?</p><p>
<em>9:54am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: very much. now go shower, i want your hair to be all clean and soft when i play with it later</p><p>
<em>9:54am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: Sounds amazing. See you in an hour, sugar x</p><p>
<em>9:55am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Typically, Rio arrives a little early. The door is knocked on at fifteen minutes to eleven, and Rio's reasoning was that it <em>added some sufficient time for a quick make out session.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not that Agatha was complaining.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The outfit she had sent Rio had her practically drooling when she had opened the door. A light grey blazer with the sleeves rolled up, matching trousers, and a black top, a little cropped with straps which cross over round her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're staring." Rio had said, before walking inside and closing the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had chosen a green dress, long-sleeved, buttoned up the middle, with a collar. She was about to get her shoes on, when Rio had hummed approvingly and said, "My colour looks good on you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thus, a ten minute make out session.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's been backed against the wall of the hallway embarrassingly quickly, tugging Rio closer by her waist. She slips her hands underneath her blazer, grazing parts of Rio's bare stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It makes her gasp, lean further into Agatha and nip at her bottom lip. Agatha whimpers softly, one of her hands circling around the back of Rio's neck. It doesn't take long before Rio's knee presses between Agatha's legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, Ri, we need— we need to stop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Why?"</em> She whines, placing her hands in Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Because, our—" Her eyes slip shut, threatening to succumb to the way Rio's touching her hair, "our reservation is at half eleven."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So?" She shrugs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We've been stood here for half an hour, sweetheart." Agatha points out, "We'll have a few hours when we get home before Nicky comes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans and steals another kiss, and another, and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Baby." Agatha flattens a hand over Rio's sternum, holding her at a distance. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She leans closer, until her lips are brushing Rio's, and then she turns her head, stopping when her mouth is right infrong of her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll let you do whatever you want to me when we get back, after I've done some work."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"After</em> you've— <em>Agatha."</em> She whines again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You'll be able to have me in two hours at <em>most</em>, sugar. Be <em>patient."</em> She teases, pressing a quick kiss to her earlobe. "Now, we need to leave or we'll be late."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She squeezes herself out between Rio and the wall, slipping her shoes on and holding her hand out for Rio to take.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The restaurant is relatively cozy, small but with an immensely good reputation. It's fine dining, not quite enough for a Michelin Star, but still more than reasonable for their first real date.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They sit in a booth, beside eachother rather than opposite, just for the excuse of physical touch. The waiters recognise Agatha by her face, bring her complimentary wine, give them the <em>best booth in the building.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You come here often?" Rio asks, once the waiter's gone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lightly, then turns to face Rio, "I'd be here once a week before I hired you." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, can you recommend me a dish?" She nudges her playfully.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The lamb is excellent. The risotto too." Agatha points to each dish on the menu.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What are <em>you</em> getting?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not sure." She stares at the menu, her mouth twisting that adorable way it does when she's thinking. "Ravioli, maybe?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the end, Rio chooses the lamb as per Agatha's recommendation, and Agatha gets the ravioli. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is really good." Rio comments, "I see why you like it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, "Not as good as your stuff." She says, "If you cooked me ravioli, it would be ten times better than this."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're saying I cook better food than the almost <em>Michelin Star</em> level chefs in—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm <em>saying</em> that if you opened your own restaurant, you'd get a star within a day. Easily." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, poking her tongue into the inside of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, yeah, it's good." She shrugs, taking another bite of pasta into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Always flattering me." Rio mumbles under her breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You deserve it, love." Agatha doesn't miss the way her eyes glimmer with the pet name.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stays touching some part of Agatha on their walk home, holding her arm or her hand or her waist. They stop for a moment at the same bridge where Wanda had interrupted them on their last date. Though it wasn't exactly a <em>date</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Back at Agatha's, Rio's lead into the office. There's a computer on a desk, a bookshelf with as many books as anyone could possibly want. Underneath the window is a sofa, a deep green, fitting in with the room's rustic but gothic sort of vibe.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I just need to send a few emails, finish a few bits up." Agatha says, sitting on the chair infront of the computer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio plops down on the sofa, immediately sighing and leaning back into it. It's so fucking comfy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Feel free to...grab a book, or something." She gestures to the bookshelf. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you know how long you'll be?" Rio whines, except she does stand to look over the books.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Someone's</em> desperate." Agatha muses, "But about fifteen minutes or so."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fifteen minutes pass, and Rio has moved her position on the sofa four times. She had found a book on plants, and while she finds it interesting, her gaze keeps flicking up to Agatha's back, to her fingers tapping on the keyboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio murmurs, laying down on the sofa with her head resting on the arm of it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, love?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— uh," Her voice falters, so does her entire being, "a—are you almost finished?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, clearly pleased with the effect her words have had on Rio. "Almost," She says, "just need to fill this out..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." She looks back down to her book, and again, fails to focus on any of the words. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's sure she's read this sentence twelve times over, between looking over the expanse of Agatha's back, her hair, her arms, her <em>hands</em>. She looks up at the clock again. Another fifteen minutes have gone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This time, rather than using her words, she shuts the book and lays it on the sofa. Quietly getting to her feet, she moves across the room until she's stood behind Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I help you, sugar?" She asks, teasingly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She reaches forwards, until her hands brush Agatha's hair, "Yes, I think you can." She then combs through her locks, tugging slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, leaning her head back, then she jerks it forwards all of a sudden, "Give me ten minutes." She requests softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It's been half an hour, cariño."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, baby, I'm sorry—" Her words cut out with another whimper when Rio's hands run back through her hair. "Ten minutes. I promise."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please," Rio murmurs, flattening her hands on Agatha's shoulders and leans closer to her ear, so she can feel her breath when she says, "I've been wet <em>all</em> afternoon thinking about this— about what you'll do to me, what <em>I'll</em> do to <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches and her fingers falter on the keyboard, before picking up with the typing again. "Go get the strap and come back down here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's out of the room and upstairs within seconds, retrieving what's come to be her favourite of Agatha's toys. Purple, slightly curved to hit just the right spots, and long and thick enough for her to feel full.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she re-enters the office, Agatha's sat in the chair, leaning back into it. Only when Rio steps further inside does she see that Agatha's in nothing but her bra and underwear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks over to her, "Come here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does, handing the strap and harness to her as she stands directly infront of Agatha, between her and the desk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I still have some work to do." Agatha says, pulling the strap up her legs, lifting her hips slightly before tightening the harness to be comfortable. "So, since you're so needy, you're going to have me inside of you, sit still— and I mean <em>still</em>, and you're going to wait until I'm done. You're <em>not</em> going to ride me. You're not going do <em>anything</em> other than sit still and wait."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stares open-mouthed, watching as Agatha narrows her eyes and bites her lip looking at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches out and takes a hold of Rio's hand, putting on that sickeningly sweet voice she knows makes Rio feral, "Do you understand, sweetheart?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, taking a step forwards, but is stopped by Agatha's hand on her chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want you to strip for me." Agatha says quietly, just above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without wasting another second, Rio carelessly takes off her blazer, throwing it towards— she has no idea, but at least it's off. She trails her hands down to the waistband of her trousers, tugging at it a little before unbuckling her belt and letting the trousers fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, the final move— she takes the hem of her shirt and pulls it up and over her head, revealing that, as Agatha had strongly hoped, she was wearing no bra. She hears the way Agatha's breath catches, and watches the way her jaw tenses when she pulls her underwear down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a fake disregard to Rio, she gestures to herself, "Come on, pretty girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio involuntarily, and relatively embarrassingly, whimpers at Agatha's words. She tries to ignore the smug smirk painted across Agatha's face, and straddles her lap.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha places her hands on Rio's hips, steadying her as she lowers herself onto the toy. She watches as it enters Rio, her gaze flickering up to Rio's face just to see her in that state.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There, that's it." Agatha mutters, "Now, wait there. I won't be long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's arms wrap around Agatha's shoulders, and she buries her head in the crook of Agatha's neck. She tries— very <em>very</em> hard to stay still, to play by Agatha's rules, but the toy is pressing just <em>perfectly</em> against all of her favourite spots.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha's hands is on her mouse, scrolling through some emails, Rio would assume, while her other hand is in Rio's hair. She scrapes her nails gently over Rio's scalp, tilting her head to the side a little to breathe her in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Carefully, slowly, Rio's fingers curl around a strand of Agatha's hair, trying to ground herself to try to—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I said keep still, Rio." Agatha says, breathlessly but sternly. She's undoubtedly as turned on as Rio, she's just doing a better job at hiding it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, please," Her head presses more into Agatha's neck, her arms tightening around her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha suddenly tugs at Rio's hair, hard enough to pull her back to look her in the eyes. A soft moan fills the room, and honestly, neither of them are sure who it was. It could have been both simultaneously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha tuts, adopting a disappointed tone. "Do you not want to be good for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No— I do, I do." Rio says quickly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Then it's quite simple, honey. Sit still." She whispers, then forces Rio's head back into the crook of her neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She whines and whines, fighting every urge to move, and tries to focus on anything but the strap deep inside of her. And then, as if on cue, she hears the faint sound of Agatha scrolling with the mouse again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And <em>then</em>, the tapping of a keyboard. With the one hand that isn't in Rio's hair. Agatha's— Rio groans. She's just riling her up, she doesn't have any more <em>work to do</em>, she must have finished ages ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha." Rio murmurs, her chest heaving. No reply. "Ag—Agatha, please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please what, love?" Both hands now rest on Rio's hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck</em>, I need you so bad, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what you want, Ri. Tell me what you need." She guides Rio's head up again as she speaks, eager to see her dilated pupils and parted lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A breathy mewl falls from Rio's lips, her brows furrowed. "Agatha," She whines.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you poor thing." Agatha sighs softly, cupping Rio's cheek with one of her hands, keeping the other stroking through her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods in response, her forehead falling against Agatha's. But she stays still. No matter how much she wants— <em>needs</em> to be fucked, she stays still.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so desperate. I can feel you dripping onto me." She husks, gliding her fingers over her own lower stomach. She then brings those fingers up infront of Rio's mouth. "Open."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does, eagerly taking her fingers into her mouth. Agatha's right— she's so fucking desperate she'd do anything she was asked. She'd even sit for <em>hours</em> until she was in tears if she was promised a few orgasms in the end.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With her tongue, Rio cleans herself off of Agatha's fingers, sucking them deeper and becoming completely lost in the sensation, being filled from both ends.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She moans at the thought, her hips subconsciously rolling against Agatha. It startles her, immediately opening her eyes and rambling, "I'm— I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Agatha shakes her head. "It's okay, sweetheart. You've been so good for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's gaze falls to Agatha's lips, which slowly curl into a smile. She can somewhat feel Agatha's hands moving up and down her back, over her hips, her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'll give you what you need, baby." Agatha promises, "You just need to tell me what that is."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I—" Rio's words fall apart in her throat, ending in a moan when her hips roll again, "I want— I need you to— to fuck me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck you <em>how?"</em> Agatha asks, positioning her hands underneath Rio's thighs. "Do you need me to be gentle?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head quickly, "No. I need—" She sighs again, "I— I need you to fuck me hard. Fast."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Good girl</em>. See? That wasn't so difficult." And seconds after the words have entered Rio's ears, She's being lifted up, into Agatha's arms. The strap is still inside her, and with the change in angle it feels somehow deeper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, kiss me. I n— I need you to kiss me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha's hands come up to Rio's face, pushing a lock of hair behind her ear before kissing her, softly, sweetly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just like that, they're moving. And Rio realises that Agatha's still holding her up, with one hand, walking her through the house like it's nothing. And, <em>fuck</em>, if it isn't the hottest thing that's ever—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri." Agatha looks directly in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What— what?" She forces out, her eyebrows knitting together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, you need me so badly." She muses, mostly to herself, a clear admitation and pride in her voice. An inkling of disbelief.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Rio agrees, her head dropping back, prompting Agatha to catch it with her free hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tangles her hand into Rio's hair, pulling her to make eye contact, "I <em>said</em>, you'll tell me if you need me to stop, won't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." She nods, "Yes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's all Agatha needs before lowering Rio onto— her bed? When did they— nevermind. Rio huffs with the pressure of being dropped, the sudden emptiness between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cariño, please, <em>please—"</em> Rio forces herself to shut up for a moment. It suddenly hits her, how she's never reacted to anyone like this, she's never been this desperate before. So desperate that she's openly and shamelessly <em>begging</em> to be fucked.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, Rio, I know," Agatha coos, "spread your legs a little— there you go, that's it, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Rio was into praise a <em>lot</em> more than she thought she was. Or maybe it was just because it was Agatha. Maybe it was her voice, the way it borders being patronising.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels herself soaking the sheets beneath her. She's never been this wet in her life. And then, Agatha's ontop of her, positioning the strap with one of her hands while the other props her up by Rio's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio whispers, pleading.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I've got you," She murmurs, just seconds before sliding the strap in with no resistance. "<em>Fuck, Rio."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please." There it is again— what the <em>fuck</em> is Agatha doing to her?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From just the single word, Agatha starts to thrust into Rio. The first few are slow, but they speed up quickly. Agatha soaks Rio's gasps and moans into her ears, mouthing at her neck to bring even more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my <em>God,"</em> Rio breathes, her back arching, hands gripping tightly around the back of Agatha's neck. "I'm— I'm not going to last long."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Then don't." Agatha says against the hot skin of her neck. "Let go."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A small wave of pleasure rushes through her, as if telling her <em>this, but better. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, she does. Emotionally, that is. Her physical hold on Agatha gets tighter, her moans uncontrolled and messy and <em>perfect.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers against her with each thrust, putting more pressure behind them. The response is immediate— Rio's legs wrap around her waist, pulling her closer, <em>deeper</em>. And then she feels it, feels Rio's back arch, her nails digging into her scalp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come for me, Rio." Agatha husks into her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's body follows the command, and she comes with a string of moans and whines and mumbles. Agatha works her through it, slowing to a stop when Rio relaxes into the mattress.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gently pulls out, removing the harness and dropping it onto the floor by the bed. Turning back to Rio, she leans in and kisses her on her lips, once, before laying on her side and drawing spirals over her stomach. "You're incredible." She murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs a laugh, still catching her breath, "Give me a second, and I'll.." She trails off, exhaling deeply and closing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You can return to favour later, sweetheart. You're cooking tonight, remember?" Agatha swings a leg over Rio's, shuffling closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am." She nods, only just really remembering the fact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, we should get cleaned up and get dressed. Do you need any water or anything?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— yeah. Water would be great, thank you." Rio smiles sweetly, running a hand through Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up, grabbing a floral robe from her wardrobe to slip on. "I'll be back in a second."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio's caught her breath properly, Agatha returns a few seconds later. Rio has a few sips of water, then lets Agatha lead her back down to the office to get her clothes strewn around the room. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They have around an hour until Nicky arrives. It's spent in the kitchen, preparing some ingredients between kisses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When they're <em>not quite</em> all over eachother, Agatha's arms more or less stay fixed around Rio's waist while she gets the food ready. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had noticed relatively early on the Agatha likes to have some part of them touching all the time. Whether it's holding her hand, playing with her hair, simply having their knees press together on the sofa. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're a lot touchier than I thought you'd be." Rio mentions. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands retreat a little, but Rio grabs them to keep them around her waist, "Is that a problem?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, I love it. Curious, that's all." She shrugs, turning around and placing her hands on Agatha's shoulders. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh," She's visibly relieved, "well, I— it reminds me that it's...real," Her words are quiet, "and it...makes me feel safe. I like being held, holding someone— <em>you."</em> The last sentence is quietest, making it clear to Rio how vulnerable she feels saying all of this to her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her hands a little, intertwining with Agatha's hair. She laughs lightly when Agatha hums and flutters her eyes shut for a moment, "I guess I just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The blunt sound of a knock on the door breaks them out of their little bubble.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, "We can talk about it another time. You should—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, Rio's interrupted, but this time it's by something much more pleasant: Agatha's lips against hers. Rio responds immediately, pulling her a little closer. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another knock on the door, and Agatha pulls away, "Stay here, honey." And she kisses her again, hard but tender, brushing her tongue over Rio's bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What was that for?" Rio asks breathlessly when Agatha steps away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs with a smile, "For having to be in the same house as you for hours and <em>not</em> touch you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She leaves Rio's chest heaving in the kitchen, and opens the front door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama!" Nicky instantly runs through, jumping up into her arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hi, baby." She ruffles his hair, then gives Wanda a look that practically says <em>get the fuck away from my house.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She's about to close the door when Wanda's hand lands flat on it, stopping her. Sighing, she lowers Nicky onto the floor. "Go on to the dining room, kiddo, I need to talk to your mom for a minute."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Is Miss Rio cooking?" He asks eagerly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She is." Agatha chuckles softly, "Go on, go say hello."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without another word, he runs into the kitchen. Agatha's gaze shifts from awe to anger within seconds. "What is your problem?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Miss Rio</em> is here, is she?" Wanda folds her arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs. She genuinely laughs. "Oh, my— answer my fucking question, Wanda. What is your problem?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My problem is that—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If you say it's that I'm seeing someone, I swear to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It isn't fair, Agatha." Wanda huffs. "We were married for twelve years. We have a <em>kid!"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, <em>I</em> have a kid. You never— you never fucking cared about him. You only have majority custody to piss me off." Agatha argues relatively quietly. She is <em>not</em> going to have a screaming match with her ex-wife while her kid and...girlfriend? is in the other room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She and Rio <em>really</em> need to talk about what they're calling their relationship. No— not important right now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're upset because I wanted a divorce," Agatha points out, <em>literally</em> pointing a finger at Wanda, "after <em>you</em> were the one who cheated, the one who stopped wanting to have sex, who refused to touch me, to sleep in the same bed, to even be in the same <em>room</em> as me—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're being dramatic. You didn't want sex either." She scoffs, "Don't act like this is all on me. You didn't want me and I gave up trying."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't want sex because you never <em>cared about me during it</em>. It was all about you." Fuck, it felt amazing to finally be saying all of this, "You just cared about whether <em>you</em> got off— you didn't care if it felt good for me, or if I came or— or if I even <em>wanted it</em> half the time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, don't fucking give me that. I would— there were times where I had <em>told you</em> I didn't want to, and you still—" She cuts herself off, unable to voice the words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so fucking—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And I'll have you know, Rio cares." She practically hisses her words, quiet enough so that only Wanda can hear. "She fucking <em>cares</em>, Wanda. I mean, <em>fuck</em> she can't get <em>enough</em> of making me come!"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, you <em>are</em> having sex—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you <em>not?</em> Fuck, Wanda, get <em>over</em> it! You don't own me— we're not married anymore. I can do whatever I want, <em>whoever</em> I want."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I still love you." She reaches out, but Agatha takes a quick step back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then out of the corner of her eye, she sees a figure carefully stepping over to her. She turns her head fully, and suddenly Rio's stood right beside her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is there a problem?" Rio asks, furrowing her brows and lands one of her hands on Agatha's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, actually, sweetheart," Agatha smiles a little triumphantly at the look on Wanda's face, "this creepy lady won't leave me alone."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You need to leave." Rio says firmly, though she's putting a lot of effort into not laughing at Agatha's comment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuffles closer to Rio, curling an arm around her waist, "You heard her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffs, "You're fucking ridiculous. Needing some sort of—" She gestures wildly at Rio, who huffs a laugh, "<em>guard dog—"</em> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, fuck <em>off</em>, will you?" Agatha reaches to grab the door handle, and slams it closed right on Wanda's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had hoped they could just pretend none of that had happened. That's what she was going to do. But of course, Rio has to be her amazingly caring self, immediately asking "Are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glances at her and nervously bites her lip, "How— how much of that did you hear?" She asks quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Enough to know that she's much more of a dick than you let on." She mutters. They share an understanding of what Rio means, of what she's referencing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha visibly tenses, "Well, it— it isn't exactly— not exactly a good <em>first date</em> conversa—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio steps forwards, wrapping her arms fully around her. She guides Agatha's head to rest on her shoulder, while Agatha's hands grip Rio's clothes so tightly she thinks they might rip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We don't have to talk about anything." Rio says softly, "But I'm here if you want to. And you— you know I would never..." She trails off.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, love." Agatha nods against her shoulder, "Did Nicky hear?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No. I came through and shut the door."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, curling her arms around Rio's waist. "I wish you could stay tonight."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Me too." Rio sighs quietly, "I can call you later?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'd like that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kitchen door suddenly swings open, and Agatha and Rio rush to pull away. This was also something they needed to talk about. Nicky. But again, it can wait.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama?" He mumbles, "Why are you crying?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn't realised she was. For a moment, she just stands there, staring at him, unsure of what to say.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She's okay, chiquito." Rio says, quickly glancing at her, "Come on, I can show you how to make that bolognese,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." He smiles, and rushes back into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a minute to look back over at Agatha, "It's okay." Before leaning forwards and softly kissing her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha merely nods, following Rio into the kitchen and brushing their hands together as she walks. Discreetly, she wipes at her eyes and runs a hand through her hair. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So," Though Rio's not speaking directly to her, her voice grounds her, "you have to get all the onion done first,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The actual words become a blur in Agatha's ears, purely focusing on Rio's tone, the actual <em>sound of her voice,</em> not really listening to a word of it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her mind flashes a little. <em>Just let me do it.</em> She inhales sharply. This is <em>not</em> the time— <em>Come on, Agatha, we're married now. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" Suddenly, Rio's voice and hand on her arm breaks her from her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, "Yeah, fine." And she can <em>see</em> that Rio isn't convinced, that she'll ask about it again when Nicky isn't here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mama, can you pick me up? I can't see," Nicky tugs at her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, baby." Her voice is trembling a little. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just before she leans down, Rio's hand brushes her lower back, whispering, "Breathe, amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep, shuddering breath, nodding. She blinks slowly, before leaning down and picking Nicky up into her arms. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He's at an angle where he can't actually see much else other than the pots and pans on the stove, and he wouldn't <em>want</em> to see much else.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, as Rio's explaining more of the cooking to him, Agatha leans her head on her shoulder. Rio's words falter when she does, but it's quickly picked back up again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She feels herself calm down, just from Rio, being near her, feeling her, hearing her. But in the midst of the serenity of the room, her phone rings from somewhere behind them, causing her to flinch a little. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She takes a deep breath, then sets Nicky down on the counter beside Rio and grazes her arm, "Do you mind watching him for a second?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all." Rio says with a gentle smile, and Agatha rushes out of the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Miss Rio?" Nicky's voice interrupts her before she can worry any more about Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, chiquito?" She replies, browning off some meat in the pan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You cook for my mama, right?" He says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Not since we started...whatever we're calling this</em>. "I do, yeah." She nods.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well..." He starts, playing with his hands, "it's her birthday on Monday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is it now? She didn't tell me that." Rio raises her eyebrows, suddenly feeling the stress of wanting to buy her a gift, a good one.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yep!" Nicky exclaims, then says quietly, "Maybe...you could help me make a cake?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I would love to." Rio smiles, "I'm sure she'd love that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yay!" He kicks his feet around, knocking the cupboard doors in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But, if you want it to be a surprise, you'll need to find a way to convince her to let you come over."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Miss Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kitchen falls quiet apart from the sizzling from the pan, or the chopping of vegetables. Rio takes a few glances at Nicky, and it's so clear that he's Agatha's. The little microexpressions in his face, his eyebrows, cheekbones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, are you busy on Sunday?" Agatha's voice suddenly sounds from the doorway.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, why?" She asks, turning around. She's glad to see that Agatha already <em>looks</em> better following her conversation with Wanda.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Would you mind watching Nicky for a few hours in the afternoon? I have some fuc— some <em>work thing</em> I can't get out of."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— yeah, of course. Anything." She nods quickly, flickering her eyes to Nicky who looks incredibly pleased that he didn't have to figure it out himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, on Sunday, Nicky comes over to Rio's house. There's no time to show Agatha around since she's in such a rush, but they can fix that another time. Valentine's is coming up, after all. The cake baking goes smoothly, making much less mess than Rio had anticipated.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's hidden away in the fridge, ready for the next day. After Agatha picks up Nicky, and thanks her with a stolen kiss when he's distracted, Rio goes shopping.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finds a necklace, one that she wouldn't have ever been able to afford before meeting Agatha. It's gold, with a letter R pendant, decorated with purple gems. Rio stares at the necklace for twenty minutes, and then picks it up. And she doesn't put it down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following day, Agatha's <em>birthday</em>, Nicky had told Rio that he was due to get picked up at four. So, naturally, Rio turns up unnanounced at Agatha's at three. It gives them time to spend together with Nicky, but mainly it was so Nicky could see Agatha's reaction to the cake.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio wears what she recently found out to be Agatha's favourite set of her lingerie, and over it, she wears another one of Agatha's weaknesses. A white vest, showing off just the perfect amount of her curves, her leather jacket, and a pair of black jeans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opens the door, the first thing she does is smile. She looks over Rio and clears her throat, before forcing out a, "Hi, what— what are you doing here, sugar?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A little birdie told me it's your birthday." She murmurs. "Can I come in?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, of course—" And that's when Rio pulls out two boxes from behind her back, one large, and the other small. "Rio,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, amor?" She tilts her head to the side, then hands over the small box, "This is for you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. What about that big one?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is Miss Rio here?" Nicky calls from the living room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, "Yes, baby, Rio's here." She then turns to Rio and says quietly, "He'll be gone in an hour, and then I'm all yours."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wonderful." Rio smiles, taking her shoes off and following Agatha into the living room. She uses that chance to overlook what Agatha's wearing— an oversized blue blouse, a pair of khaki trousers, and her glasses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Show her!" Nicky points to the big box, rocking back and forth with his excitement.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, sitting down on the sofa and revealing the cake. "It was Nicky's idea."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, was it, now?" Agatha chuckles and glances over to her son, who's now smiling as brightly as he may have in his entire life. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, but Miss Rio helped." He says quickly, giggling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." She says to Nicky, then looks back over to Rio and says, "Thank <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're welcome." She replies, then nods to the small box still in Agatha's hands. "Open it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A flash of what Rio could only describe as lust flickers into Agatha's eyes, before she clears her throat and opens the box. "Oh, Rio— this is beautiful."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You like it?" She asks, leaning a little closer to her to get a good look at the necklace again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Very much. Thank you, love." Her gaze falls to Rio's lips, and that is <em>exactly</em> when Agatha remembers her son is in the room. "Could you put it on for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Y—Yeah, yeah, of course." She shakes her head, laughing, then takes the necklace from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Moving a little closer, she clasps the necklace around Agatha's throat, brushing her fingers over the skin for unnecessarily long, and tugging on it a little just to hear Agatha's breath catch.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And after she's sat back, she discreetly sends Agatha a message, seeing as her son is <em>still in the room.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Feb 3, 2025</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ri: i can't wait to be inside you</p><p>
<em>3:41pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoots her a look after reading the message, biting at her lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>cariño: With what, love?</p><p>
<em>3:42pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: your favourite toy x</p><p>
<em>3:42pm</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat, putting her phone face down on the sofa. She can practically <em>feel</em> Rio's smirk across the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After Nicky leaves, they both lose a sense of time. Rio makes her come three times with said favourite toy, leaving her practically limp on the bed. They shower together, and wordlessly decide that Rio's staying the night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leads her back to bed, the two of them leaning up against the headboard and against eachother. "Thank you for coming." She says quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't be silly," Rio says, tracing over the line of the necklace, "I <em>wanted</em> to be here. With you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups Rio's face with both hands, brushing their lips together before Rio kisses her firmly. As usual, Rio's hands make themselves comfortable in Agatha's hair, running through the ends and scratching at her scalp. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can I braid your hair?" Rio suddenly asks, against Agatha's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A smile curls onto Agatha's lips, "You— you want to braid my hair?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes," She nods, then adds, "please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead, sweetheart. Hair ties should be in the top drawer." She nibbles at her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly grabs two hair ties, leaning back into the cushioned headboard and spreading her legs, then tapping the space between, "Come here,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha crawls into the space between Rio's legs, sitting cross-legged infront of her. The moment she feels Rio's hands in her hair again, she whimpers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A soft chuckle sounds from behind her, and Rio parts her hair evenly into two sections. She brushes through the sections individually and untangling the hair. Agatha's head falls back a little, closing her eyes with a hum.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forwards for a second, landing a soft kiss underneath Agatha's ear, where her pulsepoint is. It brings another whimper, and Rio moves her hands down to Agatha's hips for a moment to tug her a little closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to actually braid my hair or are you just going to see what other noises you can get me to make?" Agatha mutters infront of her, which just makes Rio laugh a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe a little bit of both." She smiles, her hands returning to Agatha's hair and beginning to actually braid one of the sections.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It takes a lot of effort to keep braiding, and to not just fuck her right there with the noises she's making. <em>Especially</em> when she actually starts moaning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio sighs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, sugar?" She half-turns to look her in the eye before turning back around and allowing Rio to start braiding the other side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm gonna need you to stop making those sounds if you want me to braid your hair." She says, her voice breathy and trembling.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can't help it." She shrugs, "Feels nice."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I want to finish braiding and you're making it—" The words get caught in her throat at the sound of Agatha moaning again, but this time, her hips roll a little. "<em>—very difficult."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"But your hands feel nice." She whines, and Rio can just imagine the look on her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha." She warns half-heartedly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please don't stop, baby." Agatha breathes, barely audibly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath catches at the back of her throat, and she ties off the second braid, tugging a little more than she needs to. It earns her another whimper, paired again with a roll of hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri," Agatha leans back, her head landing on Rio's shoulder, "Can you— <em>yeah</em>, yes, that," </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio scrapes her nails over Agatha's scalp, her other hand dips underneath her pyjama top, tracing patterns into her stomach. Agatha hums contently again, her eyes slipping shut.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart," She mumbles, angling her head to look at Rio properly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans close, their noses nudging together as she says, "Yes, cariño?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I need you," She whispers, brushing their lips together, "please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Agatha," Rio coos, "you like having your hair played with that much?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, biting her lip, then kisses Rio deeply, slipping her tongue into her mouth and bringing a hand up to grip the back of Rio's neck. She starts to move, trying to turn so that she can face Rio and kiss her more comfortably, but Rio holds her still by the hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Stay here." She commands, then strokes her hand over Agatha's hair again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please, love." Agatha sighs, her eyebrows knitted together in a frown mixed by frustration and pleasure. "Please."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio guides Agatha's head to lean back onto her shoulder, "Shh, relax, I've got you." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha feels Rio's free hand toying with the waistband of her pyjama shorts, she spreads her legs, her chest heaving. Rio's chin rests on Agatha's shoulder, peppering kisses over her neck, softly sucking marks into the skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The obscene moan that collapses from Agatha's lips when Rio's fingers finally brush her core surprises them both. It brings a whimper from Rio, whose fingers falter before gliding through her folds, dipping into her entrance before sliding out, stroking over her clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so wet." Rio breathes against Agatha's ear, nipping along the cartilage.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, Ri— <em>please."</em> Agatha arches her back, one of her hands coming down to grip onto Rio's thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does exactly as Agatha's silently asking, pushing two fingers inside of her— into the wet heat which instantly surrounds her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Exhaling deeply, Agatha slowly rolls her hips into Rio's hand. And Rio lets her— she lets Agatha control her own pleasure, simply just steadily pumping her fingers in and out of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hand which had been laying in Agatha's hair moves to rest on Agatha's chest, just above her heart. With a frustrated groan, Agatha leans forwards and pulls her shirt up, throwing it to the other side of the bed before leaning back down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps the steady movements of her fingers, hyperfocusing on each sound and gasp that escapes Agatha's mouth. Her other hand wanders over Agatha's chest, palming at her breasts, skimming her thumbs over her nipples.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, God, Ri, don't— don't stop." She mewls just as Rio curls her fingers perfectly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She keeps curling with each thrust, slowly working Agatha to her climax. "That's it, relax, baby."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Agatha's moan gets caught in the back of her throat, and Rio feels the telltale signs that she's nearing the edge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, she speeds her fingers up a little, delighting in the immediate effect it brings. "Are you going to come for me, Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>, the way she says her name, like her tongue is working around each of the letters, syllables— </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes— yes, I'm— <em>shit, Rio</em>,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl, <em>good,"</em> She breathes, then slows her movements just a little to draw it out, "Say it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm going t—" She groans, her grips on Rio tightening, unintentionally digging her nails in, <em>"Fuck,</em> I'm going to come for— for you,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm— Rio, I'm going to come s—so hard for you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's other hand slides down to her clit, drawing tight circles at just the perfect angle. It causes that different yet familiar pressure in her lower stomach, bringing her to grasp her lip between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, Rio you— <em>fuck, fuck—</em> sweetheart—" Her moans become pitchier, <em>much</em> pitchier and it only spurs Rio on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio thrusts her fingers faster and deeper, breathing in the smell of her hair. "Come for me, mi amor."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's a mixture of command and pet name that does it, throwing Agatha head first into her orgasm, arching her back with a high pitched moan. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The realisation that Rio's actually made <em>it</em> happen again hits her, "Fuck, you've—" Agatha huffs a breathy laugh. "How the <em>fuck</em> do you—" She exhales again, coming down from her high and leaning ninety percent of her body weight on Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Careful not to overstimulate her too much, Rio pulls her <em>soaked</em> fingers from Agatha. Her intent is to bring them to her own mouth, lick them clean and hold Agatha for a while. But one of Agatha's hands catches her wrist as she does, pulling her fingers into<em> her</em> mouth instead.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers softly at the sudden sensation of Agatha's tongue circling her fingers, licking every last drop of arousal from them. When Agatha drops her hand, Rio uses it to wrap around her waist, pulling her close.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How— how the fuck do you...do... <em>that?</em>" Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And while Rio knows <em>exactly</em> what she's talking about, she'd never miss an opportunity to tease her, "Do what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbles, pinching the flesh of Rio's thigh that she still has a hold of, "You know what I mean."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, tracing more patterns into her skin, "Maybe it'll be my little secret."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Maybe</em> I want to be able to make myself do it for when I'm fucking myself thinking about you." She counters casually, as if she hasn't just practically caused Rio to fall apart. "Or maybe for when we have phone sex. Either way." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's mouth just stays open, trying to find words but unable after Agatha's just casually admitted that she masturbates about her. Yes, they've had phone sex, but that's different. Agatha is <em>on her own,</em> simply <em>thinking</em> about Rio, and she wants to—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's soft chuckle brings her from her thoughts, "Was that all it took to break you, pretty girl?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat. "Uh— I—I can show you what I..." She takes one of Agatha's hands and guides it between her legs, moving it to the specific place she was touching her clit. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers a little, still sensitive, but allows Rio to continue. She wants to make herself squirt imagining that Rio's the one doing it, after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Right...here." Rio says, pressing Agatha's finger down a little more into her. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The amount of concentration and care in Rio's voice admittedly makes Agatha's heart swell. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And then..." She moves to take Agatha's other hand, then falters, "wait, that—that's hard to... I'll just—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, Agatha feels one of Rio's fingers sliding slowly inside of her again, shifting around until Agatha jerks against her and laughs lightly, biting back a moan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And there." Rio says, before removing her fingers and taking Agatha's hands in hers. "It might be different when you do it, but that's what I...what I do." She says quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio?" She twists her neck a little to look at Rio properly when she finishes her words, "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For... showing you how I make you squirt?" She frowns, tightening her hold on Agatha's hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Agatha chuckles, "For..." Her words get a little lost for a moment, and she shakes her head with a soft smile, "for not being like her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They don't need to share any more words about it for Rio to understand what Agatha means. So, instead of reassuring her with words, like she's already done in the past, she squeezes Agatha tighter, who sighs contently and moves back to the previous position.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So...Valentine's is coming up." Rio says quietly, tucking a loose strand of Agatha's hair behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, immediately understanding the implication, "Oh, yeah?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." She nods, chewing at her lip nervously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They sit in silence for a few moments, before Agatha turns around in Rio's arms and faces her, placing her hands on her cheeks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to hear you <em>say it,</em> Ri." Agatha points out, raising her eyebrows and stroking her thumbs over Rio's cheekbones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— do you—" She sighs and looks down for a moment, finding the right words, "will you be my Valentine?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, sweetheart, of course I'll be your Valentine."</p>

<em>8:14am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ri: holy shit okay im omw xx</p><p>
<em>8:15am</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and leans back into her pillows for a minute. She'd be lying if she said she hadn't been thinking about this for as long as Rio had. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then it hits her— Rio's going to be here in fifteen minutes and she isn't even dressed. "Oh, fuck—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Within five minutes, she's brushed her teeth and made her hair more presentable. She gets dressed in the remaining ten. After taking three of those minutes putting on her new set of lingerie. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's a lacey pale blue, embroidered with coloured flowers and leaves. Rio's going to lose her mind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Over the top, she finds a pair of plaid, black pyjama shorts at the back of her wardrobe, and grabs a random shirt on the floor of her bedroom. It happens to be one that Rio's left behind, a grey Megadeth shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then the doorbell rings. She rushes downstairs, running a hand through her hair a few times and scratching at her neck. She opens the door and is completely starstruck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's wearing a pair of jeans and a white and pale blue striped blouse. She gestures to Agatha, "So <em>that's</em> where my shirt went."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, amused, and pulls Rio inside by her hand, closing the door behind her. "Come here,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio would have easily thought of some stupid retort, but Agatha's hands land on her waist and her lips crash into hers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Smiling into the kiss, Rio pulls her closer by the back of her neck, tangling her fingers into the hair which rests there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It ultimately brings a moan from Agatha, which prompts Rio to pull away and murmur, "Don't I have breakfast to make?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans and leans into Rio, resting her head on her shoulder. "Yeah."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It won't be long," Rio promises, "and then I'll be all over you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her shoulder before pulling away, taking Rio's hand and dragging her into the kitchen. To be fair, Rio wasn't lying. Breakfast, which is scrambled eggs and toast, is made within seven minutes— <em>not that Agatha's counting—</em> and they eat within five. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio gets up, taking the plates through to the kitchen again and making a pointed effort to ignore the sounds of Agatha's trailing footsteps behind her. While she knows she's just as desperate as Agatha is, she tries to draw it out, just a little longer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she switches on the tap to start washing up, Agatha takes hold of Rio's hips from behind, momentarily stopping her, "Baby, that can wait."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a deep, husky laugh, Rio turns to tap off and places the plates in the sink. She turns around, breaking their contact before Agatha reaches her hands up to her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio waits just long enough to see the needy frown that forms on Agatha's face, and only then does she back Agatha into the counter opposite, pressing their bodies together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha's breath hitches, she curls her hands into the fabric of Rio's shirt, "I've been thinking about this all morning, sugar." She murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just chuckles, "Tell me more." And slides her hands round to Agatha's lower back, encouraging the grind her hips into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"About what— what you'd do to me, how you'd touch me," As she rocks her hips into Rio, she notices something a little different. Her brows furrow, but she keeps talking, "About...your— your mouth on me, your—" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops talking and moving entirely, feeling the unmistakable bulge between Rio's legs. She looks up at Rio with an open mouth and wide eyes, so caught off guard that she can hardly speak. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you..." She trails off, moving a hand down to the waistband of Rio's trousers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Surprise." Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I— are..." She clears her throat, instead resorting to unbuttoning Rio's jeans. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where are your manners today, Agatha?" Rio tuts, grabbing Agatha's hand with her own.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please?" She mumbles, pulling her brows together and fluttering her eyelashes the way she knows makes Rio melt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes hold of Agatha's hips and rocks into her again, "Please what, mi amor?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A whimper falls from Agatha's lips, "Please fuck me, baby."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her, dipping her tongue into Agatha's mouth before pulling away, biting her lip as she does so. She then grasps the hem of Agatha's— <em>her</em> shirt, and pulls it over her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can see the exact moment that Rio falters after she looks at her. "Surprise?" She offers, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"A very <em>beautiful</em> surprise." Rio nods, kissing Agatha again, then her chin, down her neck, the valley between her breasts, her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio reaches the waistband of Agatha's pyjama shorts, she's on her knees. Agatha has her hands gently resting in Rio's hair, which tighten when Rio pulls the shorts down and licks her lip at the sight infront of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After pressing a single kiss to her thigh, she carefully pulls Agatha's underwear down, peppering kisses across her inner thighs as she does so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha breathes. And though her hand is in Rio's hair, and though Rio's on her knees, it's clear that Agatha's the one at Rio's mercy here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, cariño?" She replies, standing up to see her up close.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I need—" Her request gets lost in her throat, and her attention instead drifts to the sound of Rio unbuttoning and unzipping her jeans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps eye contact the whole time, keeps Agatha pinned against the counter with a simple look. "Tell me what you need, querida."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know what I need." Agatha counters, swinging her arms around Rio's shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me." Rio repeats, grinning at the sigh that Agatha lets out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Just fuck me," She says, then corrects herself, "please. Please, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good girl." She murmurs, gripping her hands tighter on Agatha's waist, then lifting her up onto the counter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath catches as she does it, pulling Rio to stand between her legs. Rio kisses her, but Agatha breaks it after feeling the strap against her inner thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me, Agatha." Rio says again, their lips brushing together with her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, honey, please— please fuck me." She begs, "I need you so bad, baby."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When one of Rio's hands leave her waist, Agatha's gaze shoots down to watch as Rio angles the toy just right and— she stops. Just holding it, teasing her right infront of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please." Agatha mutters, "Rio, please. <em>Please</em>, Ri, please, please—" She abruptly cuts herself off with a loud moan as Rio thrusts into her, instantly all the way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is that what you want, baby?" Rio chuckles as Agatha's head falls to rest on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, yes, I'm— <em>fuck</em>, Rio." Just as she's about to catch her breath, Rio starts moving.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's slow at first, allowing Agatha to adjust to the stretch a little. Agatha's grip around Rio's shoulders tighten, and her legs curl around Rio's waist, keeping her as close as physically possible. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please— please go faster." Agatha whimpers against the flesh of Rio's shoulder, her teeth grazing over the skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio surprisingly complies, and moans softly with each thrust into Agatha, making it dealthy obvious that she's going to come like this sooner or later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As if sensing Agatha's needs, Rio dips her head and licks and nips across her throat, marking her so deep and red that her makeup won't be able to cover it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Claiming her.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha whines, "more, I need—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not all of her words can escape before Rio starts to slam her hips harder against Agatha's, angling slightly differently so that the strap hits her sweet spot with each thrust.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She gasps, "Just like— like that, <em>shit,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio isn't sure anything will ever make her feel as alive as this. Having Agatha clinging to her like it's the only thing she can do, clawing at her back, mouthing at her neck and shoulder, the <em>sounds</em> she's making.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Grabbing Agatha's hips, she drives the strap deeper, earning a breathy choked out moan in the process. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Keep going," Agatha whimpers, a drop of her spit trailing onto Rio's shoulder, "Keep— don't stop."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it, cariño." She mumbles, tilting Agatha's head up with one hand to pull her into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's immediately moaning into it, leaning back and causing Rio to lean over her. The slight change in angle has Agatha's back arching, and she needs to catch herself with a hand landing flat on the counter behind her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instantly missing the contact, Rio leans back again and stands up straight, pulling Agatha with her into another kiss. It's broken a few moments later when Agatha loses the ability to kiss her properly, instead resting their foreheads together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri, I'm—" Agatha bites her lip, squeezing her eyes shut, "I'm close."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want to hear you." Is all Rio says, brushing Agatha's clit with one of her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That touch alone is enough to bring Agatha to her climax, <em>loudly</em>, throwing her head back as the pleasure courses through her. It results in Rio's head dropping forwards, leaning on her collarbones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And— <em>fuck</em>. Rio's in love. She's in love with a woman she's known for just over a month and—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, please, I want— come inside of me." She places her hands on Rio's hips, driving her deeper with each thrust. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's head stays resting on her sternum, drops of sweat dripping onto Agatha as her moans grow louder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sweetheart, please," Agatha grabs her hair and lifts Rio's head up, moving her so that Agatha's mouth is directly infront of her ear when she says, "put a baby in me, Rio."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck, Agatha—"</em> It throws her right into her climax, continuing to thrust into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And while they both know that would be <em>biologically impossible</em>, it's hot to think about. "That's it," Agatha praises, her chest heaving, "good girl."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio then slows to a stop, crashing their lips together in a bruising kiss, full of tongue and teeth. Still deep inside Agatha, Rio pulls their lips apart, a thick string of saliva connecting them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So good for me. My sweet girl." Agatha murmurs, gripping Rio's jaw tight enough so she can't look away. So that Agatha can <em>see</em> the arousal in Rio's eyes at her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As if something's possessed her to do so, Rio lifts Agatha and pulls her into her arms. It surprises them both, especially as Rio starts walking them somewhere, but Agatha's the only one who says something.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Where the hell are we going?" She asks, tightly holding Rio's hair with a laugh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Bedroom." Rio breathes, and it's then clear that she's reached the stairs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha really resists the urge to just kiss the life out of her, knowing that she would very much regret it if they ended up toppling down the stairs. So, she lets Rio be careful.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's only clear that they've reached Agatha's bedroom when there's the slight dimming of light. Seconds after entering, Agatha's pressed up against the wall, her head thudding against it. Rio dips her head down mouthing at her neck and rolling her hips a little, sliding the strap so slightly in and out of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio—" Agatha unintentionally releases a breathy mewl, her eyes fluttering shut, "the bed is <em>right there." </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tries to reinforce her point by literally pointing at it, but Rio just reaches up and takes Agatha's hand, pinning it to the wall next to her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just looks at her for a moment, still slowly rocking her hips, listening to the soft gasps and sighs that fill the room. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As an attempt to rid the thought, Rio dips her head down again. She traces her tongue over every part of her neck and collar and shoulders that she can, keeping the thrusts light and gentle unless Agatha were to request otherwise.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio can feel Agatha's grip on her hand tighten a little, silently asking her to look at her. So, Rio lifts her head up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Furrowing her eyebrows, Agatha's free hand cups her jaw, her thumb brushing over her bottom lip, "You're so perfect."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The words alone have Rio whimpering, subconsciously increasing the speed of her thrusts. "Says <em>you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What does <em>that</em> mean?" Agatha asks with a smirk, squeezing Rio's hand again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It means..." She starts, emphasising with a slightly harder thrust, bringing a low moan from Agatha, "you look beautiful. You sound beautiful."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes slip shut again, her head tipping back against the wall again, whimpering. "Keep talking, baby."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your hands, your neck, the way you— you let me mark you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another whimper, louder, and Agatha's back arches into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And you feel <em>so fucking good,</em> Agatha. The way you come around my fingers, fuck, there isn't a day that goes by where I don't want that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, God, Rio—" She's cut off with another moan, Rio's thrusts becoming firmer and faster.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your eyes— the way you look at me. The way you say my name." Rio's just rambling at this point, unsure of where she's going with this, but knowing that she loves the effect it's having.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm— <em>fuck."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want to come on my cock, mi amor?" Rio murmurs, brushing their lips together just so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeaks out a moan, "So badly."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go on," She whispers, "come for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And she does. Though it wasn't as rough as they had been downstairs, the orgasm is just as strong, leaving Agatha trembling in Rio's arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gently, Rio pulls out and lowers Agatha to stand up properly, still holding her. "You did so good for me." She says.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Another whimper. Agatha's hold tightens until she can steady herself enough to push them both off of the wall. She backs Rio towards the bed, turning them at the last second so <em>she's</em> the one sat on the edge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Still catching her breath a little, Agatha reaches forwards and loosens the harness around Rio's hips, letting the strap fall to the floor with a thud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come here," Agatha taps one of her thighs, to which Rio immediately steps forwards to straddle, placing her hands in Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forwards, closing the last of the distance, and for a moment, they stay like that. Lips against lips and tongues against tongues.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But then, Agatha curls her hands around Rio's hips, dragging her over her thigh. She chuckles when Rio gasps at the pressure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want you to take what you need, honey." Agatha says in the small space between them. "Can you do that for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." She nods, already setting a steady pace along Agatha's thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good. I'd give more but <em>someone</em> fucked all my energy out of me." She half-jokes, squeezing the flesh of Rio's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows she's joking, but still she shakes her head, "This is amazing. <em>You're</em> amazing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Instead of conveying whatever she's feeling with words, Agatha meets Rio's lips in a kiss so soft that it scares her a little. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"Agatha</em>, fuck—" Rio moans against her lips, her eyes closed and mouth open.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want my hand, sweetheart?" She asks, already moving it between Rio's legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, yes— <em>shit,"</em> She comes in contact with Agatha's hand, grinding harder against it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's right, my love, take what you need." The name slips from her mouth unintentionally. She tenses for a moment before falling back into the flow of it— of <em>them.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Call—" Rio falters, "call me that again." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches, but she's more than happy to follow through, "Does my love want me to tell her how good she feels? How wet she is?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers and nods, her hips rocking faster, more unevenly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Such a good girl, my love." She murmurs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>," Rio groans, "Agatha, I'm going to—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know, my love." Agatha coos, gliding her lips across Rio's chest. "Keep going."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio does, her hips stuttering against Agatha as she climaxes, curling into her and pushing them both onto the bed in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply holds her as she recovers, her mind still racing over Rio's request. She had spent countless nights beside Rio wondering whether it would be too much. It's different to saying...the other, much scarier thing, but much more intimate than <em>love</em> on it's own.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My love?" Agatha strokes a hand through her hair, "Are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What was it you said?" Rio props herself up with a smirk, "<em>Someone</em> fucked all of my energy out of me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs beneath her before pulling her into a kiss. She has her hands on her face, holding her close even when she's pulled away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This is the first Valentine's I've looked forward to." Agatha says instead, pushing the <em>other</em> thought away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" Rio sits up, still straddling Agatha's thigh, and pulls her up to meet her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," She kisses along her collarbone before continuing, "never felt this..." <em>Loved</em>, "cared for."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, you'd better get used to it, baby," Rio says, holding Agatha's face close and threading her hands through her hair, "because there's a lot more where this came from."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their day together ends with them laying exhausted in Agatha's bed as usual. They're beside eachother, on their backs, staring up at the ceiling with their fingers laced together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had cooked lunch and dinner, each time clearly trying to rile up Agatha with the ways she was preparing the food. But, the amazing homecooked meals were worth it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Halfway through their day together, Rio had learned that, while Agatha was extremely fond of physical touch, and that there was always some part of them touching, Agatha had a favourite. Their hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And, laying in Agatha's bed with Agatha's head on her shoulder, their fingers intertwined, it hits her again. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites at her lip, sighing. Maybe she should just say it. Get it over with. She turns her head to look at Agatha and she's...asleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, Rio sighs, though this time it's relief. Yes, she loves her. She's deeply in love. So, despite the soft snoring beside her, Rio whispers, "I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Agatha doesn't stir. <em>Thank God</em>. Rio would not have been able to deal with a rejection— or even a reciprocation, if Agatha feels the same way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, Rio leans further into her and switches the lamp off, settling her head in the crook of her neck. Agatha's arms tighten around her in her sleep, simply holding her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rio wakes up on Saturday, she's warm. Insanely warm, and then she reminds herself that she's practically sleeping with a human oven. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Said human oven is still in a deep sleep beside her, their legs interlocked. Rio stays close, reaching a hand up to stroke through her hair, attempting to wake her softly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It works well— Agatha hums and flutters her eyes open, but groans and hides her head against Rio's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good morning, mi amor." She smiles, kissing the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Morning," She murmurs, then pulls away to look at her properly, "what time is it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not sure." Rio shakes her head, then picks up her phone. "Ten."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nicky's going to be here in an hour." She sighs, wrapping her arms more firmly around Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And for every second of that hour, they make it count. They spend much too long stood at the front door, finding excuses for Rio to stay a few minutes longer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come over on Monday?" Agatha asks, leaning against the door.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, smiling, "Of course." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And typically, Rio texts her early Monday morning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As it turns out, Rio has a different idea of later to Agatha. She's on her lunch break, though she stays in her office, finishing up some stuff. Without having any time to grab lunch from the kitchen downstairs or bring anything in, she settles on staying upstairs and hoping Rio cooks later. Her lunch break ends at half past twelve. Thankfully she's not due to have any more meetings today, so—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The desk phone rings, Agatha sighs. She picks it up, "Yes?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Miss Harkness, there's someone here for you."</em> Billy explains.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't have any more meetings today, do I?" She says, frowning. "Who is it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Says her name is Rio?</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh!" A smile spreads across her face, "Let her in, Teen."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The phone call ends, and Agatha takes the clip out of her hair to let it loose. When the door opens, Billy stands holding it open, and <em>then</em> she sees Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hello, my love." Agatha smiles, beckoning her over. She then looks at Billy and almost laughs at the look on his face, "Thank you, Teen."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He leaves without a word, closing the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here?" Agatha's smile doesn't leave her face, if anything, if grows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio walks over to her until she's right next to her, then plops a bag on her desk. "Brought you lunch."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sweetheart, you didn't have to." She tilts her head to the side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Figured you would've been too busy catching up on everything you missed." She says. "You know, with all the days off you keep taking for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, "Thank you." And then her gaze trails down, lingering on the <em>skirt</em> that Rio's wearing. "Since when do you wear <em>skirts?</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Since I need you when you're at work." She spins Agatha's chair around so that they're facing eachother, and steps between her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip and takes a hold of her hands, "How did you even know I'd be free?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Lucky guess." She smiles, "Planning to get the kid to send me your schedule."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah?" She tugs Rio closer.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's hands tighten their hold on her own, "Yeah." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well—" A sudden knock on the door startles them, but they hardly move apart. Agatha sighs, "Yes, Teen?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He walks in, and his eyes instantly lands on their hands, laced together. "Uh— I— sorry for...interrupting, Miss Harkness,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Teen, this is my lovely girlfriend, Rio." She gestures to her with a smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nice— nice to meet you." Billy murmurs. "Miss Harkness, there's some people here to see you about a...some sort of music charity?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tell them to arrange a meeting with me and come back tomorrow." Agatha says, with a dismissive wave of her free hand. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Miss Harkness." He nods with a small smile and turns around to leave, closing the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Girlfriend, huh?" Rio asks, grinning widely and leaning down, cupping Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Problem?" She lays her hands on Rio's waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Not in the slightest." She murmurs, tongue darting out to wet her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods her head towards the office door, "Go lock the door, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>No questions asked, Rio strolls to the other side of the room, slowly locking the door. She turns back to Agatha, who's now stood up.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She walks back over, pausing when she's directly infront of her, and allows Agatha to manhandle her into being pinned to her desk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Couldn't wait just a few more hours, could you, my love?" She coos, bunching Rio's skirt up around her waist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," She whines, gripping the edge of the desk until her knuckles are white.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You look so good like this." Agatha muses, running her hand up and down Rio's spine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha's hand trails down her thighs, listening to Rio's ragged breaths. The hand lifts higher until they reach the fabric of Rio's underwear, already wet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're soaked," She leans close to Rio's ear, whimpering a little at her own words. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Teasingly, she draws circles over Rio's clit through her underwear. Rio can hardly keep quiet, biting at her lip so hard it leaves a lasting dent, almost drawing blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, wait— what— what about Billy?" She stammers, though her breathy tone gives her away. She doesn't care about Billy being right outside.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"You</em> wanted this, darling, remember? Came in here, said how badly you needed me. Be quiet." She says, then furrows her brows, "Or, if you'd prefer, I can get him to go downstairs, so you can <em>scream my name</em> as loud as you need to, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, "Yeah," And moves her hands to grip the back of Agatha's head, tangling in her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha reaches for the phone, she doesn't stop her movements on Rio's clit, and murmurs, "Shh," When she's about to call Billy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He answers within seconds, "<em>Yes, Miss Harkness?"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Go take your lunch break, Teen." She says quickly, keeping eye contact with Rio, "And take your time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He repeats he usual, "<em>Yes, Miss Harkness. Thank you."</em> Before Agatha hangs the phone up and slides her hand beneath Rio's underwear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck,"</em> Rio drops her head into the crook of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Conscious of time, Agatha pushes two fingers knuckle-deep into Rio, curling just how she likes it. Rio reacts immediately, rolling her hips against Agatha's palm and meeting her thrusts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you go. Good." She mutters, her own breathing becoming shallower and more uneven.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I want— I'm gonna make you come <em>so</em> good when you're— when you're done," She promises with a whine, tightening her hold in Agatha's hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'd certainly <em>hope so</em> after interrupting my work." Agatha responds, using her other hand to guide Rio's head up into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their teeth clatter and their tongues fight for control, but what they both <em>really</em> love is the sounds they're each making.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, you feel so good around my fingers." Agatha moans, sucking a mark into Rio's neck, "So good for me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's what brings Rio— unexpectedly— to orgasm. She tenses up and becomes a whining and whimpering mess, cleanching around Agatha's fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Upon feeling Rio's body relax against her, hearing her deep breaths, Agatha removes her fingers. She brings them to her own mouth, licking them clean before pulling Rio into another deep, slow kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Rio's recovered enough to take some sort of charge, she tugs Agatha's hair enough to seperate their lips for a moment. "Sit down."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha backs away, sitting down in her chair again, Rio kneels down infront of her. They both work quickly to pull Agatha's trousers and underwear off, leaving them in a pile by her feet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without wasting another second, Rio grabs her by the hips and tugs her forwards. Agatha's <em>dripping.</em> And Rio can <em>see it.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She glides her tongue between Agatha's folds, dipping shallowly into her entrance. Agatha's hands fly to grip her hair, pushing her in a little deeper.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We— <em>fuck</em>, Ri, we don't have long," She whines, "don't tease me, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's certainly enough for Rio to slide her tongue deeper into Agatha, before pulling out and enclosing her lips around her clit. Agatha's back arches, digging her hands harder into Rio's hair and rolling her hips forwards slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You taste so good." Rio whimpers against her, and the vibrations of it bring a louder mewl from Agatha's throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In need of a better angle, Rio hooks one of Agatha's thighs over her shoulder, gripping the flesh so tightly that it leaves little indents of her nails. Like this, she gently sucks her clit into her mouth, meanwhile bringing her fingers up to tease at Agatha's entrance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio pushes two fingers inside of her, her hips jerk forwards, grinding into her face, "Rio, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She slowly pumps her fingers in and out, dragging across her sweet spot each time, coaxing her to her climax.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio, you—" Agatha almost laughs at feeling that new but now familiar build up in her lower stomach, "you're gonna—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What am I gonna do, Agatha?" She asks with a knowing smirk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I swear to God, if you—" She cuts herself off with a moan, "if you make me squirt in— in here, I'm going to fucking <em>kill you."</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Don't threaten me with a good time, mi amor," She husks, "besides, you know I always clean up after myself."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"God, Ri— <em>fuck,"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know." Rio says, thrusting her fingers deeper with each thrust and swirling her tongue perfectly around Agatha's clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha comes with a choked out moan, her thighs tensing around Rio's head, practically trapping her in place. Her head falls back over the edge of her chair, arching into Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And of course, the physical evidence of it lands across Rio's chin and hand, who whimpers with the sensation. She removes her fingers and licks them clean, followed by lapping up every last drop of wetness from between Agatha's legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps a hold of Rio's hair, tightening her grip each time her tongue brushes gently over her clit. When Agatha's taste starts to fade, she leans back and rests her head on Agatha's knee.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I am <em>so</em> annoyed at you." Agatha huffs, still catching her breath, then mumbling something about <em>making a mess of the chair.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio rises to her feet, helping Agatha back into her underwear and trousers, "Felt good though, didn't it?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck off." She laughs, grabbing Rio's face and dragging her into a kiss, humming at the taste of herself on Rio's tongue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now that Agatha's properly dressed again, she pulls Rio to sit in her lap, not once breaking the kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I should probably go," Rio sighs, "let you get on with your work."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods, then kisses her again. "But first, there's— I've been meaning to ask you something."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows, running her fingers through Agatha's hair, "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, you know how the kitchen downstairs is Michelin Star?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm?" Rio hums, tilting her head to the side a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The head chef quit a few days ago." Agatha says, "We've had someone step in for now, but I— I thought maybe you'd like to take the job?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's jaw falls open, her hands stilling in Agatha's hair. She isn't sure what to say, so she says nothing, but Agatha keeps talking.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know you've said you like the freedom you have now and you like what you do, but just hear me out?" Agatha holds Rio's waist, rubbing small circles into the fabric of her shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The kitchen's open from eleven to two." Agatha explains, "You'd be in charge of menus, dishes that are served, managing the other chefs. And you'd obviously be doing some cooking of your own."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods along with everything Agatha's staying, still in shock that she's just been offered the role of head chef in a <em>Michelin Star kitchen.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Three hours a day." Agatha clarifies, "I know you said you missed being in the kitchen— but <em>this</em>, it means you can keep doing what you're doing now, like, the catering for big events, <em>and</em> be in the kitchen. <em>And</em> it pays well— fourty an hour. It also means we'd be working in the same building."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Rio suddenly blurts out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? You— you'll take the job?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Absolutely. Yes, holy <em>shit</em>, Agatha. I— when do I need to start?" She asks frantically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Whenever you like, my love. The man we have stepping in is...fine, but—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can start on Wednesday."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? Amazing, that's— okay." She nods, smiling. "I can also...change my hours around a little. Come in later." She says, "Meaning you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can stay over more often?" Rio asks, grinning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, sweetheart. Meaning we can come into the office at the same time. You can do your work, I'll do mine. You can come and see me whenever you'd like, as long as I'm not in a meeting."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you so much, mi amor. This is— this is amazing."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're welcome, my love."</p>

<p>That coming weekend is the first time Agatha and Rio spend time together at Rio's house. Agatha had only ever seen part of the hallway when picking up and dropping off Nicky a couple weeks prior, and since then, she's been eager to see the rest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, they arrange on spending the weekend together. Now, they probably would have whether there was a plan or not, but that isn't the point.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's only request to Agatha was to <em>wear something comfortable and get there at nine</em>. She gave no other hint to any plans for their weekend. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knocks on the door to Rio's house at 8:53am, wearing one of Rio's lost jumpers, a pair of jeans, and her glasses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thirty seconds later, the sound of keys in the lock fills Agatha's ears and it opens, revealing Rio. For a moment, Agatha doesn't say anything. She just looks at the woman she's undoubtedly in love with.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's wearing, like Agatha, a jumper and pair of jeans. She leads Agatha inside with their hands linked, and closes and locks the door behind them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Tour?" Agatha suggests, sliding her shoes off and swinging their hands around.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If you <em>promise</em> to not stop it in the bedroom." Rio replies slowly, raising her eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs dramatically before softly pressing their lips together, "Fine, but only because I'm staying the whole weekend."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shows her the kitchen, the living room, bathroom. It looks just how Agatha imagined it would have, and it's just perfect.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then Rio's bedroom. Agatha takes a once over of the room, the deep green of the bedsheets, mimicking moss, the arrays of plants on the window. Back to bedsheets again. Flicking her eyes over the length of the bed, the pile of soft pillows, the—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Something on your mind, mi corazón?" Rio asks, the teasing in her tone evident with the way she tilts her head looking at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's about to answer, but she pulls her eyes from the bed to look at Rio with a curious frown, "What does <em>that one</em> mean?" She asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My heart." Rio glances down to Agatha's lips, "What were you thinking about, cariño?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups either side of Rio's jaw, leaning close so that she can <em>feel</em> Agatha's words on her face. "I was thinking about how good you'd look on that bed with me filling you up."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A quiet moan escapes Rio's lips, surprising herself in the process. She doesn't speak though, only bringing her hands up abruptly to grip at Agatha's arms.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues, "I was thinking about how you'd look underneath me. How you'd look riding me. How you'd look with—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is this a to-do list?" Rio half-jokes. But the darkening of her pupils show that she very much <em>wants</em> it to be a to-do list.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio crashes their lips together, speedily moving her hands to grip Agatha's face. The kiss can hardly be described as <em>soft</em>. Quite the opposite. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands slide down to Rio's hips, pulling them to rock against hers and giving no space between them. The moan encourages her to continue, gently walking Rio backwards until the backs of her legs make contact with the bed. At that, Agatha pushes her down onto it, making no effort to follow through.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's chest is heaving as she asks, "What are you—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Take your clothes off." Agatha interrupts, already pulling the jumper over her head and throwing it across the room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She watches as Rio does the same, and they both remove their jeans, only seconds apart. For a moment, she takes in the sight of Rio. And it is so much more incredible than she had imagined. The black lace underwear set she's wearing comes together perfectly against the tones of her skin and the duvet, and Agatha has to force herself to look away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha picks up her overnight bag, she can feel Rio's eyes on her. She doesn't exactly blame her though— wearing that navy blue set she had worn on their first time— she would stare, too.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had packed each of their favourite toys and the harness, along with some toiletries. After all, she'd just end up stealing some of Rio's clothes. No point in bringing her own. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha's fitted the purple dildo into the harness, and the harness around her hips, she turns back to face Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Leaning back on her elbows, Rio's legs are swinging ever so slightly over the edge of the bed. And, <em>God</em>, it looks enticing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Lay down." Agatha gestures to the bed, and watches as Rio instantly complies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Rio moves to lay in the centre of the bed, her head resting on the pillows, Agatha climbs onto the bed. Once Rio's comfortable, leaning over her and pushing her legs apart with her knees.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's arms hook around the back of Agatha's neck, and she looks up at her with so much need that Agatha thinks she's going to go <em>insane</em> if she doesn't fuck her soon.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Propping herself up on her forearm beside Rio's head, Agatha trails her other hand down Rio's body. To her surprise, Rio catches her wrist just as it reaches her hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm soaked." She says, her eyes flicking between Agatha's eyes and her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to hurt you, baby." Agatha murmurs, her other hand gently grasping some of Rio's hair between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio releases her hand, then nods. As much as she's desperate to have <em>all</em> of Agatha inside of her, she knows she's right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sighing a moan, Agatha glides two fingers between Rio's folds before slipping those fingers knuckle-deep into her. She feels Rio clench around her, and the second she relaxes, Agatha parts her fingers a little, spreading Rio apart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, please," Rio tugs on her hair slightly, forcing her to make eye contact.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without breaking said eye contact, Agatha slides her fingers out of Rio and pushes them into her own mouth, sucking them clean. She watches the way Rio's eyes darken, the way her lips part. To top it all off, she whimpers as she removes the fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Cariño," Rio says under her breath, her voice hardly coherent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans forwards, brushing their lips together as she gently thrusts the strap inside of Rio. A moan falls from Rio's lips at the same moment that she connects their lips, the sound getting muffled against them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha's hilt deep inside her, pressing against every spot, Rio groans. Agatha's hands curl firmly into her hair, resting her forehead down onto Rio's.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha moves her hips, nudging their noses together and moaning softly as the base of the toy presses against her clit. She looks up at Rio's eyes, the way the band of honeyed brown so thin she can hardly see it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're so beautiful." Agatha says quietly, softly connecting their lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sliding her tongue between Agatha's lips, Rio runs her hand up and down her spine, landing on her lower back. She pushes Agatha to thrust deeper, a little faster, until the kiss breaks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Seriously, Ri, you're—" Agatha moans breathily, "you're so, <em>so</em> fucking pretty."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, "Yeah?" And continues to guide Agatha into thrusting deeper and faster. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Uh-huh," She husks, "and you'll look even prettier when you come for me like the good girl you are."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>," Rio's back arches into her, her eyes falling shut. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ri— Rio, sweetheart, look at me," It's more of a request than a command, one which Rio quickly accepts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When their gazes lock, Agatha glides one of her hands down Rio's body, circling her clit firmly with two fingers. The response is instant, Rio's arms tighten the hold around Agatha's shoulders, pulling her closer. Not only that, but the moan that tumbles from her mouth only pushes Agatha closer to the edge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Moments later, Agatha catches the familiar signals that Rio's close. She moves her fingers a little faster, thrusts the strap a little deeper, and Rio unravels beneath her, a string of moans and whimpers cascading from her lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just watching her, watching her fall apart like this is enough for Agatha to reach her own peak, her head dropping into the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once each of their aftershocks have subsided, Agatha carefully pulls out, but doesn't make any move to get up or take the harness off. Instead, she just lands kisses on every part of Rio she can reach. Her shoulders, her neck, her cheeks, nose, forehead, lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pulls back, the look in Rio's eyes almost has her whimpering. She keeps it back, biting her lip and brushing their lips together, about to kiss her, until she hears Rio's voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What was it you said earlier about me riding you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lightly, threading her fingers through Rio's hair, "You're insatiable."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is that a yes I can ride you?" She asks, </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you so much.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, my love." Agatha leans up with a smile and manoeuvres herself so that she's leaning against the headboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stays laying down for a moment, patiently and shamelessly staring as Agatha makes herself comfortable. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Except the very second that Agatha opens her arms and utters a small, "Come here," Rio doesn't think she's ever moved so fast. So much so that Agatha huffs a soft laugh, pulling Rio into her lap by her waist. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio meets her lips in a kiss so fragile it almost brings tears to Agatha's eyes. Her hands are on Agatha's face, her thumbs stroking over her cheekbones.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>I love you, Agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reluctantly, Rio pulls away, taking a hold of the strap to angle it correctly. Agatha rests her hands on her hips, supporting Rio as she lowers herself down. Her eyes stay stuck between Rio's legs, watching as the strap enters her, threatening to make her whine with desperation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's it," Agatha murmurs, the words voiced before she even thinks about it. They come naturally.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio shudders as she bottoms out, her hands tightly gripping Agatha's hair. "<em>Fuck</em>,"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Your pace, Rio." Agatha says, keeping a firm hold on Rio's hips. It's not controlling, not demanding— Agatha wants Rio to take exactly what she needs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, starting by just rolling her hips, feeling the toy touch her just perfectly. Her eyes stay locked on Agatha's, the blue in them hardly visible anymore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She catches Agatha furrowing her brows and biting her lip, occasionally whimpering. So, she switches her movements up a little, lifting herself up before dropping back down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The force of it sends them both moaning, their chests heaving equally as strong.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're doing so good, darling." Agatha cups Rio's cheek with one hand, caressing it lightly before returning to it's place on Rio's hip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Blinded by her pleasure, Rio just nods in response, hardly able to pull together a coherent string of words. Instead, she leans closer, their lips millimetres apart. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't kiss her, no. That's when Agatha realises it's so she can hear her properly. Agatha bites back a laugh. Rio's always loved how vocal Agatha is.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They keep their intense eye contact, holding eachother close and breathing short jagged breaths into the space between.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, Agatha sees it as clear as day. They're not <em>fucking</em>. They're <em>making love.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Her next words escape before she can even try to stop them, "Fuck, I love you so much."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Through the slight shock of her own words, Agatha feels and sees Rio falter for a moment before gripping her chin, closing the space and capturing her lips in a deep but short kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you, Agatha." Rio breathes, their lips brushing with her words.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, no words come out. Agatha needs to say <em>something</em>, but the only thing that can come out is a weak, "You— you do?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes— fuck, of <em>course</em> I do. How— how could I <em>not?"</em> Her eyes fall shut, groaning with the increasing tightening in her lower stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then, Agatha feels Rio's hands on her face again, and when she focuses, Rio's looking so softly at her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love you." Rio says again, firmly, with no room to argue.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn't thought that the light pressure of the strap against her clit would be enough to make her come, but Rio's words alone prove her wrong. It's unexpected, but welcomed, her head leaning back with a breathy moan as she rides out her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio— Ri, come for me, my love." Agatha tightens her hold a little on Rio's hips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Rio does just that. Her back arches with a drawn out whine, before slumping forwards into Agatha's hold, resting her head on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After catching her breath, Rio lifts herself off of the toy. She loosens the harness from around Agatha's hips, then removes it, dropping it off the edge of the bed with a thump.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She stays straddling Agatha's lap, stroking through her hair with almost every part of them in contact. Her gaze flickers down to Agatha's lips a few times, and just as she's about to decide to lean in and kiss her, she notices something flicker across Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's almost...sad?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you..." Rio trails off, leaning back a little to look at her properly. "Are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, my love." But the gentle shimmer in her eyes says otherwise. "I just— I..." She shakes her head, "sorry."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry?" Rio frowns, "What— why?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I haven't heard someone who isn't my son tell me that in a <em>long</em> time." She explains quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't say anything at first, but with the softness in which she's looking at her, Agatha exhales shakily.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And I haven't...had someone to say that to in a long time, either." Agatha adds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So...are these happy tears?" Rio asks softly, wiping a stray tear away with the pad of her thumb.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She laughs a watery laugh, "Very happy, sweetheart." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Good." Rio nods, then kisses her, kisses away the salt of her tears. "I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love <em>you</em>, honey." Agatha replies, quietly but sincerely. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They say it countless times that weekend, whether it's during lunch, dinner, when they're showering, having sex, in the mornings, evenings. They can't say it enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On Sunday night, Agatha ends up staying despite that not having been the original plan. She's reading a book with Rio curled up against her, leaning her head on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn't actually focusing on the words, though. She isn't even making an effort to seem like she is. Just blankly staring at the page. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taking a quiet, deep breath, she chews at her lip, hardly able to stop the flow of her mind. It starts off simple, with simple questions like, <em>should she tell Nicky? How would he react?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But then, it turns into <em>less</em> simple thoughts. What if she told him and he felt betrayed? Betrayed that she, in his eyes, moved on from Wanda within three months. Or maybe, he'd want to stop seeing her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe, Nicky would finally say it to her face. <em>Why don't you love Mommy anymore?</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha?" Rio's voice sounds softly beside her. "Are you okay? You haven't turned a page in ten minutes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sighing, Agatha closes the book and sets it down on the bedside table. "I'm okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, you're not." Rio sits up and reaches for one of Agatha's hands, taking it in her own. "You're trembling."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm— really, I'm okay." She offers Rio a smile which doesn't quite reach her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs and tilts her head to the side, "Agatha, something's bothering you." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes tightly and leans her head back against the headboard. "I think I want to tell Nicky."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay." Rio nods, visibly relaxing now that she knows it's nothing <em>bad</em>. "Is that...bad?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know." She huffs a hollow laugh, glancing at Rio. "I don't— what if it upsets him?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, turning to face Agatha with her whole body, "Why would it upset him?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't respond. She closes her eyes and leans forwards into her girlfriend, curling her hands into the fabric of her pyjamas.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, Nicky's the most amazing kid I've ever met." Rio strokes up and down Agatha's back as she speaks, "And if he's <em>anything</em> like you, then he'll just want you to be happy."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, "You're right. I— I'm just nervous. Overthinking it."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's okay." She says, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. "You have him next weekend, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha sits up but keeps her hands in Rio's shirt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What if I came over, and we can tell him together?" Rio suggests, tilting her head a little to the side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You'd do that for me?" Her words are quiet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, mi amor." She lays back down into the pillows and holds her arms out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha eagerly takes the invitation, curling into her with an arm around her waist. "I love you." She mumbles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love <em>you</em>, cariño." Rio responds, "Get some sleep, okay?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Mhm." She sighs contently, shutting her eyes and focusing on the feeling of Rio's hand in her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unlike Rio had expected before falling asleep last night in Agatha's arms, she doesn't wake up to the sound of her nine o'clock alarm. Since she started working in the office kitchen, Agatha's started going into work at the same time as her, so there was no need to wake up early.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, when she isn't woken up by the alarm, she's a little confused. Instead, she wakes much, <em>much</em> earlier than usual with vague recollections of her dream.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"That's it, baby, you're such a good girl for me." Agatha purrs in her ear. "Taking me so well."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oh. Of course. Rio was having an <em>extremely</em> vivid dream about Agatha fucking her senseless. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Still in a deep sleep, Agatha shuffles a little, tugging Rio closer and subconsciously tucking a thigh between Rio's legs. It only makes Rio acutely aware of how <em>wet</em> she is.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio stifles a whimper, biting her lip. Her hips subtly rock against Agatha's thigh out of their own accord, and it takes almost all of Rio's concentration to stop.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>This is fine. This is— no. No, this is torture.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But what makes that a lot fucking harder is when Agatha curls even <em>closer</em>, her thigh pressing up <em>firmer</em> against Rio's core.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This time, a soft moan tumbles from Rio's lips. She clasps a hand over her mouth, but slowly removes it once she sees that Agatha's still asleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Careful not to wake her, Rio leans over her to check the time on her phone. <em>Half past three in the morning. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a sigh, she flops back down onto the mattress, simply trying her best not to focus on the way Agatha's unintentionally touching her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She tries <em>really</em> hard to relax, to fall back into sleep, but the brief memories of her dream keep filling her mind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Fuck, Ri, you feel so good," Agatha whines, "you're so wet for me."</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs deeply again, accidentally releasing a small groan, and muttering a small, "<em>Fuck</em>." Under her breath.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She then hears some movement beside her. Jerking her head over to Agatha, Rio catches her shifting herself to prop herself on an elbow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In doing so, Agatha's thigh falls from between Rio's legs. It brings a sigh of half-relief, half-frustration from Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What are you awake so early for?" Agatha asks quietly, her voice raspy from sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio presses her thighs together, shifting a little under Agatha's gaze. "Woke up and couldn't fall back asleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, stroking a hand through Rio's hair. "How come?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat. "I, uh..." And <em>then</em> she sees a smirk start to play on Agatha's lips. God, her face must be insanely red.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What's wrong, Rio?" She asks teasingly, narrowing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing," Rio shakes her head quickly, then urges, "sleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums. "Or, you could tell me why you can't sleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs and shuffles into Agatha, hiding her face in the pillows beside her. "Or not."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come on, my love," She coos, "maybe I can help?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitches, quiet enough that Agatha can't hear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why can't you sleep?" Agatha presses softly, pushing her thigh back between Rio's legs. This time, when Rio's breath catches, Agatha hears it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Need you." Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chews on her lip above Rio, leaning her head on Rio's, "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Dreamt about you." She elaborates a little, hoping Agatha isn't going to make her say much more. Instead she repeats, "Need you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I can certainly help with that, honey." She places a hand on Rio's shoulder and urges her to lay on her back again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As she obeys Agatha's guiding hand, Rio fists her hands into Agatha's hair, like usual, and pulls her into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles into it, climbing over Rio as she deepens the kiss. One hand holds her weight beside Rio's head, while the other wastes no time to trail down her body and into her pyjama shorts, between her folds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A soft chuckle fills the room, "You must have had a good dream." Agatha muses with a smirk, "You're so wet."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, her eyes slipping shut just to jolt open again as Agatha slides her middle finger inside of her. Her moans soon become muffled as Agatha crashes their lips together again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kiss is lazy, sloppy, tired, but it's just what they both need in that moment. Agatha shifts to straddle one of Rio's thighs, who immediately tenses the muscle so that Agatha has something firmer to grind onto.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Agatha rolls her hips, whimpering into Rio's mouth, gliding their tongues together, she uses her free hand to grip Rio by the hair, pinning her head into the mattress.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps her finger slow. <em>Painfully</em> slow. And the worst part is that Rio knows <em>exactly</em> what Agatha's doing. Drawing it out just to hear her whine, hear her beg.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The kiss only breaks when the need for oxygen proves too strong, practically ripping them apart. Agatha's head drops to Rio's shoulder, still keeping her building slowly to the edge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," Rio whines, "I need more."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, the hot breath warming Rio's skin. "I know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, squeezing her eyes shut and arching her back before saying, "Please, mi corazón."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Again." Agatha commands, a soft moan catching in her throat at the slightly new angle. She manoeuvres her thumb to press against Rio's clit with every painstakingly slow thrust, just to encourage her to beg a little more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under her breath, Rio whispers, "Please." Her breathing growing quicker. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At this, Agatha trails kisses up her neck, traces the line of Rio's jaw with her tongue, and lands a deep kiss to her lips. Just as Rio's about to pull away and beg some more, Agatha thrusts her fingers faster, each time rubbing at just the right spot inside her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, <em>fuck</em>, please don't stop." Rio's back arches with a whine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Moving her hands down to Agatha's hips, she lifts her thigh up so that it's pressing more firmly into her core. She encourages each movement, just as eager to see Agatha come undone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ag— Agatha, ride my—" Her sentence is cut short with a sharp inhale when Agatha slips another finger inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, instead of continuing to voice her request, Rio uses her actions. Looking into the blue of Agatha's eyes, she moves a hand between Agatha's legs, desperately sliding two fingers into her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>"God</em>, my love, you feel so— so good." Agatha's hips stutter as she adjusts to riding Rio's fingers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha." Rio mumbles it the second she starts to feel that tension in her lower stomach moments before release.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Come— come for me, sugar." Agatha stammers, her eyes fluttering shut.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>All it takes for Rio to fall over the edge is Agatha's words. She clenches around Agatha's fingers as she comes with a relieved moan.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"There you go, good— good girl." Agatha praises breathlessly, working her through her high.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once Rio's aftershocks have ebbed away, Agatha removes her fingers from Rio, licking them clean as she sits up, gaining a much better angle than before. Rio's fingers brush perfectly against that spot inside of her, bringing an involuntary high-pitched moan from the back of her throat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha, eres tan hermosa," Rio's free hand comes down to Agatha's hip, guiding her to roll her hips a little faster.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While Agatha has no idea what Rio said to her, it pushes her closer to the edge. Just the simple tone of Rio's voice when she speaks Spanish— Agatha can't get enough of it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, that's it, keep going." Rio chews at her lip, moving her thumb to press into Agatha's clit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the direct contact, Agatha falls apart instantly, dropping forwards ontop of Rio as her orgasm rushes through her. Her head lands against the crook of Rio's neck, whimpering as her hips jerk into Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio only slips her fingers from between Agatha's legs when she relaxes against her. At that, Agatha shuffles to curl into Rio's side, tracing gentle patterns into her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Think you can fall asleep now?" Agatha teases, lightly dragging her nails over Rio's skin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs lightly, "As long as I don't dream about you fucking me senseless again."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" Agatha sits up, a smirk playing on her lips, "Do elaborate."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Absolutely not." Rio pulls her back down into her arms, stroking a hand through her hair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Stop that." Agatha huffs playfully.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio fights back a laugh, "Stop what?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Trying to distract me. Tell me about your dream, my love." She coos.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio just continues to comb through Agatha's hair, scratching at her scalp.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe I could even recreate it tomorrow." Agatha mutters under her breath. She stifles a chuckle as Rio's hand instantly halts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I can tell you in the morning." Rio says. "We need to sleep."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, deal." Agatha nods and nuzzles further into Rio's side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's unbelievable to think that they managed to get to work on time that day. They hardly managed to keep their hands off of eachother, resulting in Rio going to see Agatha <em>three times</em> during the day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The third time, they simply agreed that Rio would stay over at Agatha's that night. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That next Tuesday morning, Rio's woken by a surprisingly early alarm. She groans, burying her face in Agatha's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shit." Agatha's voice sounds from above her in a sigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" Rio asks, tightening her hold on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I have therapy. Completely forgot."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Rio sits up. "Well, I—I could drop you off? Wait until you're done?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her, a soft grin on her face. "Really?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"And..." Rio continues, tracing a finger across the line of her jaw, "we could take the day off?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You're lucky I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I really am."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio sits with Agatha in the waiting room, a comforting hand on her thigh. She strokes across the surface with her thumb, silently comforting her. Agatha's hand comes down to rest on Rio's, playing with her fingers. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They're abruptly dropped when her therapist comes through. "Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up and clears her throat, before turning to Rio and pressing a gentle kiss to her lips. "I'll be back in an hour, my love."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods with a smile, then playfully shoos her away to the therapist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I take it that's Rio?" Dr Gray asks once they're out of earshot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't fight her smile as she says, "Yes."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, things are going good?" He opens the door to his office, taking a seat and picking up his notebook.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Extremely," Agatha agrees, nodding, "things have never been better."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Glad to hear that. You seem happier— she treats you well?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Very well. It's...weird, honestly. I'm not really used to it, still, but she— she's perfect."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Amazing." Dr Gray smiles, "Now, I...I wanted to touch on a few things today, that we haven't really spoken much about before."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's face falls a little, nodding her head and crossing her legs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"If things get too much, we can stop, I know this is a difficult topic."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Is..is it about my mother?" Agatha asks quietly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Dr Gray says, shaking his head. "Wanda."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She inhales sharply, her breath trembling a little. "I..."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"We don't have to do it today." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No, we...we can." Agatha says slowly. Her hands dig into the fabric of her clothes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So...a few weeks ago, you said that Wanda didn't really care much about you. I asked whether she had that attitude when you were intimate with her and—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes." Agatha cuts him off. "It was always about her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dr Gray nods, keeping quiet to allow Agatha to continue at her own pace.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She didn't care if— if I liked it or if I even <em>wanted</em> it, but I just...let her."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Letting her doesn't mean that you gave consent." He mentions gently.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He continues carefully. "But things are different with Rio?" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah." Agatha nods quickly, a smile already flickering in her features. "She cares. She says I deserve to feel...loved. She loves me."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha returns to Rio after her session, she's on her phone mindlessly nibbling at her fingernails.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She only stops when Agatha's stood infront of her, reaching a hand out to take hers and pull her to her feet. "Ready for our day off, my love?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Always."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Precisely four days later is when they decide they're going to talk to Nicky. Admittedly, they're both nervous. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>While Agatha isn't entirely ready to have this conversation with her son, she knows she needs to. She wouldn't want him to find out through anyone else.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just imagining him walking up to her, saying <em>is Rio my new mommy?</em> sends an uncomfortable shiver down her spine. Because, yes, she can absolutely picture that being their future, but that's what scares her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And, what if, Rio were to stay over one night, and Nicky were to have a nightmare, come running into Agatha's room— just to see her in bed with the woman Nicky knows as her chef?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Or, maybe Wanda would decide she'd be an even bigger bitch than she already is, tell him that <em>Mama's found herself a girlfriend and she probably loves her more than you.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe then, Nicky would actually agree to Wanda's preferences of allowing her to have full custody.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Fuck, Agatha really needs to call her lawyer.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She can't let Nicky find out any other way than her telling him. And she wants— <em>needs</em> Rio there. Needs her to hold her hand and silently comfort her in that amazing way she does.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, when Saturday afternoon comes, and Agatha and Rio and Nicky are sat together, Agatha has no idea what to say.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They had spoken about it a little the night before, but hadn't come to any sort of conclusion after Rio had continuously reassured Agatha that it would be okay. That she's good. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And just like that, a night which was supposed to be calm and preparing turned into them fucking into the early hours of the morning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They've been sat in silence for five minutes. Rio's looked over to Agatha ever few moments, trying to encourage her to say <em>something</em>. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finally does when they hit the six minute mark. "Nicky, I...there's something I need to talk to you about."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Mama." He says, turning around to face her and plopping back on the sofa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You know that Rio's a good friend of mine, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Miss Rio is a very good friend." He nods enthusiastically.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In response, Rio and Agatha lightly chuckle. Rio reaches for Agatha's hand, gently comforting her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She is." Agatha nods. "But sometimes, when you <em>really</em> like someone, they can become more than a friend."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Like, a best friend?" He asks innocently.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She lowers her head a little with a soft smile. "A little more than a best friend." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nicky doesn't speak, only waiting for Agatha to clarify further.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Rio and I..." She starts, but finds herself unsure how to finish, eventually settling on, "have been on a few dates."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Dates like you and Mommy used to go on?" He then asks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, baby." She says. "Rio's— Rio's my girlfriend."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Again, nothing. Nicky takes in what she's said, and it worries her for a moment. Until he shrugs and smiles, "Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay?" Agatha frowns. "You don't...have any questions?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Nope. You love Miss Rio and Miss Rio loves you." He says easily. "I know you don't love Mommy any more."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean?" She asks, her hands tightening it's grip a little on Rio's. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"She talks about you on the phone sometimes. She always says how you didn't love eachother for a long time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." She sighs, a little relieved that she didn't have to say any of it to him herself. "Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she turns back to Rio, she openly leans closer, resting her head on her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I told you." Rio whispers into her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up." Though it isn't serious, not at all. She laughs with her words. "I love you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I love <em>you</em>."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That night, they lay curled up together underneath the covers, some random documentary playing on the TV.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They know full well neither of them are paying any attention, only really using it as an excuse to hold eachother without sleeping.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for today." Agatha eventually speaks up, squeezing her hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio's repsonse comes naturally. "You're welcome." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha abruptly turns of the TV. "How ever can I repay you?" And her voice drops into an obviously sultry tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha." Rio warns, though a smirk is threatening to spread onto her face. "Nicky's here."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"That's <em>hardly</em> an excuse, my love, we both know you can be quiet when you need to be." She shifts to lay half on top of Rio, a leg between her thighs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What if he has a nightmare and walks in?" Rio offers, finding it increasingly harder to resist.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"The door's locked."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks between her eyes and lips for a few tense moments, before sighing, "Okay."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay?" Agatha trails a hand down to Rio's inner thigh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Please." Rio breathes, arching her back ever so slightly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, baby, you're so desperate." Agatha muses mockingly, slipping a hand beneath Rio's underwear and through her folds.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To keep her quiet, Agatha crashes their lips together in a bruising kiss as she pushes two fingers inside of her with no resistance.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A weak, "More," Is muttered against Agatha's lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With this, Agatha pulls her fingers out slowly before re-entering with a third, stretching her so deliciously that she needs to hold her free hand over Rio's mouth to ensure no noise is made.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, you're so— so <em>open</em> for me." Agatha sighs, moving her hand from Rio's mouth so that she's free to respond.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It— it was difficult to focus when you were touching me like that."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, please." Agatha chuckles, starting to actually move her fingers at a slow pace. "I was <em>hardly</em> touching you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You were teasing me all night." Rio counters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh, honey, Nicky's here, remember?" She coos, her voice dropping into that irresistably sweet tone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Agatha," She sighs, biting her lip to stifle a moan, "Agatha, please go faster."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to be good and stay quiet for me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods a little too frantically, "Yes, I promise, please—"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Shh." Agatha dips her head and mouths at Rio's neck, just to make it that little bit harder to keep quiet. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As per Rio's request, though, she thrusts her fingers faster, pressing her fingertips against the perfect spots inside of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifts her head up, kissing her again with force and slipping her tongue between Rio's lips. The added sensation quickly pushes Rio to the edge, having her toppling over it within seconds, soft whimpers escaping her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The fingers between Rio's legs slow, gently pulling out. "There you go. See? I told you you can be quiet."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, wiping the hair out of her face before placing her hands on Agatha's cheeks. "You're incredible."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I know," She shrugs, sitting up still straddling Rio's thighs, "we should sleep though, it's late."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No." Rio tugs her back down by the back of her neck, to which Agatha laughs and brushes their lips together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"No?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Wanna make you come first." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles. "Be my guest, sugar."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the following few months, they spend almost every night together. Whether it's at Agatha's or at Rio's— they're always together. Rio cooks most nights, knowing it's one of the many ways further into Agatha's heart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha asks Rio to move in with her in their seventh month together, she agrees willingly. While Rio had spare clothes at Agatha's, a spare toothbrush, some of her books, it was different to actually <em>live</em> there. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio eventually convinces Agatha to have an in-depth talk with her lawyer regarding Nicky's custody. She had brought it up a few times a month for three months, and when Agatha actually agreed, she didn't quite believe it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It isn't that Agatha didn't want more custody over Nicky. Ideally, she wanted full custody, of course. But it was the fact that she'd have to go to her lawyer and tell him exactly why Wanda shouldn't have majority custody. A woman who didn't tend to her wife at all during her pregnancy should not have majority custody over the child.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio convinces her. She's there when she talks to the lawyer, there when there's meetings with Wanda, and there afterwards.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, by Nicky's ninth birthday, Agatha's achieved equal custody. <em>Much</em> better than minority, but still not quite enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She keeps pushing, eventually getting more meetings, more appointments with her lawyer, and by the time for her and Rio's year anniversary, she's earned full custody.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nicky adjusts extremely quickly and happily to staying with Agatha. Though, the thing that pleases Agatha to no end is how well he and Rio get along. He often joins her and Rio in the kitchen while she cooks, and insists that Rio teaches him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And when the time comes four years later, Agatha asks him to be the flower boy for their wedding. Walking down the aisle and decorating it with the purples and greens, being the first to cheer when they're pronounced married.</p>
