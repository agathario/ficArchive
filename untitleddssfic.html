<h3 id="h.qms25hvxxj00">Flashback: The Night That Shouldn't Have Happened
        </h3>
<p>7 years ago. Somewhere in D.C. A designation-neutral gala hosted by Jennifer Kale.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The music was low, the lighting soft and strategic - designed to flatter faces, conceal motives, and
                encourage bad decisions. A place where designations weren't discussed openly but whispered behind hands.
                A neutral territory, in theory. In practice, the Dom-heavy crowd still carried themselves with the
                entitled gravity of people who'd never had to flinch at a raised voice.</p>
<p>Agatha Harkness stood near the bar, the cut of her midnight-blue suit razor-sharp, glass of bourbon dangling
                between two fingers. She looked like temptation wrapped in steel. The kind of woman people approached
                because they wanted to be punished.</p>
<p>She was already bored.</p>
<p>Until Rio Vidal walked in.</p>
<p>The air shifted.</p>
<p>Short black dress. Unapologetic eyeliner. Hair pulled back like she'd done it in the cab, which she probably
                had. Her presence was sharp, magnetic. A Submissive - Agatha's instincts clocked it instantly - but not
                soft. No visible collar. No handler. Just Rio, walking through a Dominant-infested party like she dared
                someone to put a hand on her.</p>
<p>Agatha sipped her drink and watched her like a slow fire.</p>
<p>Jennifer Kale appeared beside her. "Don't do it."</p>
<p>"I'm just standing here."</p>
<p>"You're pre-stalking. That's worse."</p>
<p>"She's a Sub," Agatha murmured, low and private. "She shouldn't be here alone."</p>
<p>Jen snorted. "She's fine. Probably safer than you. That's Alice's old college roommate, by the way.
                Brilliant. Dangerous. And I'm serious - don't."</p>
<p>But Agatha was already gone.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They collided near the back hallway, near the door to the kitchen where servers filtered in and out. Rio was
                holding a glass of wine she wasn't drinking. She turned slightly when Agatha stopped a little too close.
        </p>
<p>"You've been staring at me all night," Rio said coolly. "Should I be flattered or file a complaint?"</p>
<p>Agatha tilted her head. "That depends. Are you planning to cause trouble?"</p>
<p>"I'm not the one blocking exits and smirking like a Bond villain."</p>
<p>Touché.</p>
<p>Agatha chuckled. "You're not what I expected."</p>
<p>"That's the point."</p>
<p>"You're a Submissive."</p>
<p>Rio's eyes flicked up. "And you're a Dominant. What a thrilling start to a conversation."</p>
<p>Agatha stepped closer. "That wasn't judgment. Just observation."</p>
<p>Rio met her gaze, steady and unyielding. "Then here's another one - you're used to people folding when you
                look at them like that. I won't."
        </p>
<p>"I don't want you to fold." Agatha's voice dropped. "I want to know what happens when you don't. "</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Ten minutes later, they were in the coat closet.</p>
<p>It shouldn't have been hot. There were hangers digging into Rio's back, the muffled sound of distant music
                through the wall, Agatha's breath catching in her ear.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>Agatha had her pressed against the wall, her hand cradling Rio's jaw but not forcing anything. Waiting.
                Giving her space to leave.</p>
<p>Rio's fingers curled around Agatha's wrist, held her there.</p>
<p>"I don't kneel for strangers," Rio whispered.</p>
<p>"Good," Agatha rasped. "I don't want your obedience."</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her like she hadn't decided yet. Like she was trying to figure it out one inch at a time.</p>
<p>It was slow. Tense. Desperate, somehow, without being rushed. Hands roaming with the practiced restraint of
                two people who knew exactly how far they could go without losing control - but wanted to.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>It didn't go further than a kiss. Maybe two. Maybe a hand under a shirt, a low sound in someone's throat. But
                when Rio finally pulled away, eyes bright and cheeks flushed, she said:</p>
<p>"This doesn't mean anything."</p>
<p>Agatha nodded.</p>
<p>And lied.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They didn't speak again after that night.</p>
<p>Agatha told herself it didn't matter.</p>
<p>Rio told herself she wouldn't fall for a Dominant with perfect hair and a careerist smirk.</p>
<p>Years later, they'll pretend that night didn't happen.</p>
<p>But they'll both remember.</p>
<hr/>

                was feeling during/after this scene?</p>

                                        Engagement</span></span></span></h3>
<p>Seven years later - Office of Designation Policy, Washington D.C.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The room smelled like polished wood, cold air, and power.</p>
<p>Agatha Harkness sat at the head of the long glass conference table, dark nails tapping an even rhythm against
                her tablet. Her suit was slate gray today - tailored within an inch of its life. Her posture dared
                anyone to speak first.</p>
<p>They didn't.</p>
<p>She liked it that way.</p>
<p>"Thank you all for coming," she said, tone smooth as silk over steel. "We're entering the final phase of
                planning the task force. I want the appointment list finalized by Friday."</p>
<p>"Even the Sub rep?" asked Jameson, the Deputy Coordinator for Inter-Designation Affairs. "We're still vetting
                - "</p>
<p>"She's already been selected," Agatha said.</p>
<p>A pause. A shuffle of papers. A wary glance from Jennifer Kale, seated a few chairs down. She didn't speak.
                Yet.</p>
<p>Agatha set her tablet down. "Dr. Rio Vidal will serve as our Submissive liaison. She's authored three of the
                most cited designation reform proposals in circulation, worked on two cross-agency equity audits, and
                refused government funding for all of it."</p>
<p>Jameson blinked. "She... refused funding?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't accept grants from Dominant-run institutions," Jennifer muttered. "Calls it designation
                laundering."</p>
<p>"She sounds like a handful," Jameson said, lips twitching.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't smile. "She is. That's why I want her."
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha wasn't nervous.</p>
<p>She didn't get nervous.</p>
<p>She just didn't expect the oxygen to shift the moment the door opened.
        </p>
<p>Because there she was.</p>
<p>Rio Vidal. Same walk, same sharp gaze, same natural defiance humming under her skin like a low-level current.
                Her clothes were plain - slim black pants, blouse, no jewelry. No collar. Never a collar. But somehow
                she looked like she'd just stepped off the cover of Fuck You Weekly.</p>
<p>Agatha stood, because manners didn't cost her anything.</p>
<p>Rio stopped just inside the room. Her gaze landed on Agatha, caught, held.</p>
<p>And then, cool as frost: "Director Harkness."</p>
<p>Agatha nodded. "Dr. Vidal."</p>
<p>The silence pressed in.</p>
<p>Jennifer made a strangled sound that might've been a cough or a laugh. "Well, this isn't going to be awkward
                at all. "</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They moved to Agatha's office for the actual meeting. Just the two of them.</p>
<p>Agatha gestured to the chair across from her desk. "You can sit."
        </p>
<p>"I know," Rio said, and didn't.</p>
<p>She stood instead, arms crossed, gaze scanning the bookshelves like she wasn't carefully not looking at
                Agatha. "So. You want a token Submissive. Congratulations. I'm very qualified for the role of decorative
                resistance."</p>
<p>"I don't want a token," Agatha said quietly.</p>
<p>"No? Then why the sudden interest in reform? You've had, what - ten years in policy? All those speeches about
                "collaborative designation balance' and "harmonious role integration'? You're fluent in bullshit,
                Harkness."</p>
<p>Agatha flinched. Just slightly. Enough for Rio to notice. And regret it.</p>
<p>She sighed. "You shouldn't have chosen me."</p>
<p>"You were already chosen," Agatha said. "I just... finally had the power to make the offer."</p>
<p>That hung between them.</p>
<p>Rio looked away.</p>
<p>Agatha stood, moved around the desk. Stopped a few feet away.</p>
<p>"I know I'm the last person you want to work with."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure I want to work with anyone."</p>
<p>"But if you do," Agatha said, softer now, "this is real. You won't be background. You'll have full access.
                You'll help draft the actual legislative framework. You'll be heard."</p>
<p>"By who?" Rio asked bitterly. "The people who want to leash us? The ones who say we're too emotional, too
                vulnerable, too dangerous to be allowed authority?"
        </p>
<p>Agatha met her eyes. "By me. "</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>Rio blinked once. Slowly. "Don't make promises you don't intend to keep."</p>
<p>Agatha said nothing.</p>
<p>Rio turned toward the door.</p>
<p>But just before she left, she looked back - just a glance over her shoulder, guarded and sharp and entirely
                unforgettable.</p>
<p>"I don't kneel for you," she said.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice was steady. "I don't want your knees."
        </p>
<p>Rio paused.</p>
<p>"...What do you want?"</p>
<p>Agatha didn't answer.</p>
<p>Because if she did, she might say everything.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.ij0rke29zg07">Chapter One: Terms of Engagement (cont.)</h3>
<p>Rio's hand was already on the door handle when Agatha's voice caught her - not sharp, not forceful. Just...
                real.</p>
<p>"Just please consider it."</p>
<p>Rio froze.</p>
<p>That wasn't Dominant-speak. It wasn't wrapped in negotiation or veiled with authority. It wasn't an order. If
                anything, it sounded like something Agatha didn't know she was capable of saying until it was already
                out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Rio turned halfway, not enough to make it easy.</p>
<p>And Agatha stood there, hands relaxed at her sides, mouth set in something almost like vulnerability.</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>"I'll think about it," Rio said finally, voice flat but eyes too bright.</p>
<p>Then she left.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't sit for a long time after.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.xha298de0nf8">Chapter Two: Post-Meeting Debrief</h3>
<p>Jennifer Kale's office. Twenty minutes later.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>"She said no, didn't she?"</p>
<p>Agatha didn't answer. She was standing by the window, staring out like the city had done her personally
                wrong.</p>
<p>Jen shut the door behind her and tossed a file onto the couch. "She said no. Or she said "I'll think about
                it,' which in Rio-speak means "go light yourself on fire and then maybe I'll roast marshmallows on your
                corpse.'"</p>
<p>Agatha huffed. "She didn't say that."</p>
<p>"She was thinking it."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Jen arched a brow. "So. Are we doing this again?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
<p>Jen crossed the room and poked Agatha in the shoulder. "The subtle manipulation. The handpicked office chairs
                that only recline slightly for Subs. The fact that your last three policy memos read like anxious love
                letters. And now this? You hand-select Rio Vidal - the one person guaranteed to ruin your blood pressure
                - and look genuinely hurt when she doesn't jump into your lap?"</p>
<p>Agatha finally turned, spine tight. "I asked. Politely. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Jen stared at her. "That's the problem."</p>
<p>Agatha sat down on the edge of the desk. "Do you think she'll actually consider it?"</p>
<p>"I think she's already halfway through a bottle of wine and planning seventeen ways to sabotage you."</p>
<p>Agatha's mouth quirked. "She's brilliant."</p>
<p>"Terrifying," Jen corrected. "And still into you."</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes narrowed. "You don't know that."</p>
<p>Jen smirked. "She looked at you like she was mad you stopped kissing her."</p>
<p>Agatha said nothing.</p>
<p>Jen leaned in, voice quieter now. "You still want her?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Simple. Stark. No point denying it.</p>
<p>Jen blinked.</p>
<p>"Well. Shit."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.2pd53ew5ptwb">Chapter Three: Flashpoint</h3>
<p>Rio's apartment. A very stubborn bottle of wine. The past creeping in.
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio paced.</p>
<p>Her phone sat untouched on the counter. She hadn't called Alice. Not yet. She didn't want the smug voice
                saying you're not over her.</p>
<p>She wasn't. Obviously.</p>
<p>She'd made it exactly three steps into Agatha's office and her brain had short-circuited. The voice. The
                scent. The way Agatha's gaze pinned her like a dare she almost wanted to lose.</p>
<p>And then that line.</p>
<p>"Just please consider it."</p>
<p>Not Dominant. Not neutral. Just real.</p>
<p>It was the exact kind of thing that made Rio's carefully constructed walls feel... soft. Like she remembered
                what it had felt like to be seen by her.</p>
<p>Goddammit.</p>
<p>She poured another glass. Sat down. Closed her eyes.</p>
<p>And remembered.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.sisn8x11rg2q">FLASHBACK - Rio's POV</h3>
<p>Seven years ago. The same gala. The moment she realized she was in trouble.
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio didn't believe in fairy tales. Not for people like her. Designation dictated that Subs were meant to be
                claimed, not courted. Sheltered, not partnered. Controlled, not heard.</p>
<p>She'd learned to play the system. Smile sharp. Voice low. Never show weakness. Never show want.</p>
<p>But then she'd walked into that party, and there she was.</p>
<p>Agatha fucking Harkness. Looking like control in heels. Smelling like bourbon and smoke and trouble. Eyes
                like storms.</p>
<p>Rio felt the pull immediately.</p>
<p>It made her mad.</p>
<p>She didn't want to feel anything for someone like her - so clean-cut, so smug, so obviously used to
                obedience. She expected another entitled Dominant trying to prove she was "different."</p>
<p>But then Agatha had said:</p>
<p>"You're not what I expected."</p>
<p>And meant it.</p>
<p>She'd waited for pressure. There was none. She'd waited for condescension. Only curiosity. She'd waited for
                the assumption that a Sub couldn't possibly say no - and instead been asked if she wanted to.</p>
<p>And then they kissed.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>That kiss was not polite. It was a question. A promise. A threat. It said I know you're dangerous, and I want
                you anyway.</p>
<p>No collar. No power games. Just... tension, crackling between them like electricity in the air before a
                storm.</p>
<p>Rio remembered the precise way Agatha had held her - not gripping, not groping. Framing her. Anchoring. As if
                she were made of something worth protecting.</p>
<p>And when she'd said "This doesn't mean anything," Agatha had nodded like it didn't kill her to agree.</p>
<p>Like she'd let Rio go because it was what she wanted.</p>
<p>Only, it wasn't.</p>
<p>Rio opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Seven years later and her body still remembered the feel of Agatha's breath at her throat.</p>
<p>She picked up her phone.</p>
<p>Texted Alice.</p>
<p>You up?</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.c68mdzcnosoc">Chapter Four: Damage Control</h3>
<p>Rio's apartment - 11:17 PM. Incoming chaos.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Alice Wu-Gulliver had many admirable qualities:</p>
<ul class="c15 lst-kix_4c42486mez2t-0 start">
<li class="c9 li-bullet-0">Fiercely loyal</li>
<li class="c9 li-bullet-0">Sharp as hell</li>
<li class="c9 li-bullet-0">Fashion-forward</li>
<li class="c9 li-bullet-0">Blessed with the uncanny ability to open a bottle of wine using a house key
                        and sheer spite</li>
</ul>
<p>...and she was, unfortunately, the last person Rio should've texted tonight.</p>
<p>Because when Rio typed "You up?", the reply came back fast.</p>
<p>Alice:</p>
<p>Is this about Agatha<br/>Or did you finally decide to let me set you up with that Switch who teaches yoga and
                makes his own candles<br/>He smells like citrus and daddy issues</p>
<p>Rio:</p>
<p>Agatha.</p>
<p>Alice:</p>
<p>Fuuuuuuck.<br/>I'm bringing wine. You don't get a choice.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Alice blew in like a hurricane. No shoes. Two bottles under one arm. A bag of chips in
                the other.</p>
<p>"I brought emotional support carbs," she said, toeing the door shut behind her. "Now talk."</p>
<p>Rio blinked. "I didn't ask you to come over."</p>
<p>"You texted me. That's consent."</p>
<p>Rio gave her a look. "We're not talking about that tonight."
        </p>
<p>Alice plopped onto the couch. "Too bad. Because I know that face. That's your "I made out with a Dominant
                seven years ago and now she's offering me power and respect and maybe emotional safety and I hate it'
                face."</p>
<p>"I don't hate it," Rio muttered.</p>
<p>"Which part?"</p>
<p>Rio didn't answer.</p>
<p>Alice ripped open the chips. "Start from the beginning."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Ten minutes and half a bottle of wine later, Alice leaned back and exhaled.
        </p>
<p>"She said please?" Her brows nearly shot off her face. "Agatha Harkness said please ?"</p>
<p>"Just - "please consider it,'" Rio muttered. "Like she didn't even realize it was a big deal."</p>
<p>"Oh, babe." Alice took a long sip. "That's a huge deal. That's practically down on one knee in Dom language."
        </p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"So... what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Rio stared at her wine. "I don't know. I want to trust her. I want to believe this isn't just another power
                play. But I can't tell if she actually sees me or if she just wants a reformed pet to parade around in
                front of the press."</p>
<p>"Okay, first of all? You'd be the worst pet ever. You'd bite."</p>
<p>"I have."</p>
<p>"I know. Iconic."</p>
<p>Rio gave a half-laugh. It felt raw.</p>
<p>Alice softened. "Look. I get it. But I've seen the way she looks at you. She's not posturing. She's haunted."
        </p>
<p>"I don't want to be someone's redemption arc."</p>
<p>"Then don't be." Alice leaned in. "But maybe... just maybe... you could be her partner."</p>
<p>Rio frowned.</p>
<p>Alice grinned. "Besides. It'll be fun to watch you terrify all those stuffy designation bureaucrats."</p>
<p>"I'm not scary."</p>
<p>"Sweetheart," Alice said, tipping her wine glass toward her, "you walked into a Dom-heavy gala at
                twenty-three and made Agatha Harkness forget how to breathe. You're terrifying."</p>
<p>Rio flushed. Looked away.</p>
<p>Alice tilted her head. "You still want her."</p>
<p>"Not the point."</p>
<p>"But you do."</p>
<p>Rio closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Quietly: "I never stopped."</p>
<p>Alice exhaled. "Then maybe it's time to find out if she never did either."</p>

<h3 id="h.occahox81wdf">Chapter Five: Confirmation</h3>
<p>Agatha's Office - 7:04 AM the next morning.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha was already at her desk when the notification pinged. She didn't look up at first - her mornings were
                tightly choreographed rituals: tea, briefings, silence.</p>
<p>But her fingers paused on the touchpad when she saw the sender's name.
        </p>
<p>From: Dr. R. Vidal<br/>Subject: RE: Task Force Participation<br/>Sent: 6:58 AM</p>
<p>She opened it.</p>
<p>I'll do it.<br/>I expect full access.<br/>Don't waste my time.</p>
<p>Three lines.</p>
<p>Three bullets to the chest.</p>
<p>Agatha stared at the screen for several seconds. Then she sat back, exhaled slowly, and allowed herself the
                smallest of smiles.</p>
<p>Not relief. Not exactly.</p>
<p>Something closer to acceptance of fate.</p>
<p>Because Rio wasn't just joining the task force. She was entering Agatha's airspace again. Her orbit. Her
                world.</p>
<p>And Agatha? She'd spent seven years convincing herself that was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Apparently, she was done pretending.</p>
<p>She reached for her tablet, opened a fresh folder, and labeled it VIDAL - LIAISON before tapping the
                intercom.</p>
<p>"Jennifer," she said.</p>
<p>Jen's voice crackled through. "Already here. Already judging you."</p>
<p>Agatha ignored that. "Schedule a preliminary coordination session for this afternoon. Just me and Dr. Vidal.
                I want it private."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"...Do I need to set up a safe word?"</p>
<p>"Jennifer."</p>
<p>"Just being thorough."</p>

<h3 id="h.q7o9h8bz3qxw">Chapter Six: Preparation Rituals</h3>
<p>1:37 PM. The meeting is at two. Two women on opposite sides of the city. Not thinking about each other. At
                all.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h4 id="h.ii0pnrm49bcv"><span class="c14 c3">Rio</span></h4>
<p>She stood in front of her open closet like it had personally offended her.</p>
<p>She wasn't dressing for Agatha. Absolutely not. This was a professional meeting. Political. Strategic.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>She bypassed the soft cotton button-downs and went for the black silk blouse instead - the one with the
                drape-neck that showed a hint of collarbone when she turned just right. Understated. Confident.
                Dangerous, if read correctly.</p>
<p>Pants, not a skirt. Slim, high-waisted, and structured enough to telegraph authority.</p>
<p>No jewelry. No scent. She stared at the vial of synthetic designation-neutral perfume for a beat, then left
                it on the shelf.</p>
<p>Let her smell exactly what she was.</p>
<p>Let her deal with it.</p>
<p>Hair: sleeked back, tied low. Lipstick: a deep, blood-wine red. Enough to distract. Not enough to invite.</p>
<p>She looked in the mirror. Adjusted one cuff. Let her gaze settle.</p>
<p>Game on.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h4 id="h.uatvewpchgxw"><span class="c3 c14">Agatha</span></h4>
<p>Her wardrobe was already arranged - black suit, navy suit, pinstriped charcoal. She went for the charcoal. It
                brought out the ice in her eyes and looked hell on earth with red lipstick.</p>
<p>Which, speaking of - </p>
<p>She opened the small drawer in her vanity that she only used on rare days. Debated. Chose the red. Brushed it
                on with surgeon-level precision. Blotted. Nodded once.</p>
<p>Hair: twisted into a loose chignon. Not soft. Elegant.
        </p>
<p>Under her jacket, she wore a black silk shell - smooth, high-necked, sleeveless. She'd worn it once before.
                Seven years ago. She hadn't worn it since.</p>
<p>Was it intentional? Unclear.</p>
<p>She adjusted her cuffs. Looked at her reflection. Lifted her chin.</p>
<p>Power. But not intimidation.</p>
<p>She could lead without posturing.</p>
<p>She could want without showing it.</p>
<p>She would not break.</p>

<h3 id="h.dh4ozpjg0xiu">1:59 PM. Harkness' Office.</h3>
<p>Rio knocked once and entered without waiting.</p>
<p>Agatha looked up from her desk.</p>
<p>Their eyes met.</p>
<p>The click of the door behind Rio was soft - but it might as well have been thunder.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.osnl77i2pda9">Chapter Seven: The Meeting</h3>
<p>2:00 PM - Harkness' Private Office, D.C. Task Force Headquarters
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Outside the office...</p>
<p>Alice leaned against the wall, pretending to scroll her phone. Jennifer Kale leaned beside her, actually
                scrolling, but one brow was arched high enough to qualify as an FCC violation.</p>
<p>When Rio walked past, they both went still.</p>
<p>"You didn't warn me she was going full Bond villain," Alice muttered, eyes locked on Rio's low ponytail and
                cut-to-precision slacks.</p>
<p>"She didn't tell me," Jen said. "I would've brought popcorn."</p>
<p>The hallway air shifted again.</p>
<p>Agatha stepped out of her office.</p>
<p>She wasn't wearing her usual blue. Charcoal. High collar. Sleeveless shell. Red lipstick like a fuck-you
                signature.</p>
<p>Alice made a soft, strangled sound. "Oh no."</p>
<p>Jen didn't blink. "Oh yes."</p>
<p>The two women locked eyes.</p>
<p>No greeting. Just shared gravity.</p>
<p>Then Agatha held the door open.</p>
<p>Rio stepped through.</p>
<p>The door closed.</p>
<p>Alice whispered, "They're going to ruin each other."</p>
<p>Jen, quietly: "God, I hope so."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Inside the office...</p>
<p>Agatha gestured to the seat across from her desk.</p>
<p>Rio took it, slow and deliberate. No coat. No bag. Just her and that blouse and that scent, cool and rich and
                undeniable.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't speak right away.</p>
<p>Neither did Rio.</p>
<p>The silence wasn't awkward. It was a tension test.</p>
<p>Agatha finally folded her hands on the desk.</p>
<p>"Thank you for accepting."</p>
<p>"I haven't thanked you."</p>
<p>"Point taken."</p>
<p>Rio's lip twitched. "I assume you want to discuss terms."
        </p>
<p>"Mutual expectations," Agatha said smoothly. "Access, authority, media handling. You'll be included in every
                draft. I won't cut you out of the final recommendations."</p>
<p>"And you'll put my name on them," Rio said. "Not yours."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't flinch. "Yours first. Mine second. Unless you ask otherwise."</p>
<p>That got her a blink. Just one. But from Rio, it was a crack in the wall.</p>
<p>"I also want access to internal metrics," Rio added. "The data behind your policy audits. I know what the
                public versions leave out."</p>
<p>"Done."</p>
<p>"And I want my own assistant. No one from your staff."</p>
<p>Agatha paused. "You don't trust my people?"</p>
<p>"I don't trust anyone with my voice," Rio said. "Least of all someone who answers to a Dominant."</p>
<p>Agatha leaned forward. "You think I want to silence you?"</p>
<p>"I think you don't know what it means to make room."</p>
<p>That stung. More than it should have.</p>
<p>Agatha sat back, exhaled through her nose. "Then teach me."</p>
<p>That stopped everything.</p>
<p>Rio's brow lifted - slow, surprised. She hadn't expected capitulation.</p>
<p>She definitely hadn't expected it to sound... sincere.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said after a beat. "I'll teach you."
        </p>
<p>"But I'm not kneeling."</p>
<p>Agatha's voice was quiet. "And I'm not asking."</p>
<p>Another beat.</p>
<p>"Then we have an understanding," Rio said.</p>
<p>"We do."</p>
<p>They stared.</p>
<p>This was the moment. The inflection point . They could pull back. Cool off. Get to work.</p>
<p>But instead - </p>
<p>"Are you going to keep looking at my mouth every time I speak?" Rio asked, tone infuriatingly casual.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't blink. "Only if you keep wearing that shade."
        </p>
<p>Rio smiled.</p>
<p>Not sweet.</p>
<p>Sharp.</p>
<p>"Then I guess I will."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.ye1rbqmo49nb">Chapter Eight: Quiet</h3>
<p>Later that night - Agatha's apartment. 10:47 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The windows stretched floor to ceiling, framing the D.C. skyline like a museum piece. Agatha sat in
                near-darkness, city lights casting long shadows across the minimalist furniture. Her drink - bourbon,
                neat - sat untouched beside her on the table.</p>
<p>Her jacket was draped over the back of the chair. Hair loose. Makeup gone. Still perfect posture, still that
                carved-in-stone stillness. But her fingers tapped lightly on the armrest, like they were searching for
                something they hadn't touched in years.</p>
<p>She'd replayed the meeting more times than she'd admit.</p>
<p>The moment Rio had walked in.</p>
<p>The way her voice curled around words like blades she wasn't afraid to use.</p>
<p>The smile.</p>
<p>"Only if you keep wearing that shade."</p>
<p>Agatha hadn't smiled back. But she'd wanted to.</p>
<p>She'd wanted a lot of things.</p>
<p>And wanting - that - was dangerous.</p>
<p>Her tablet buzzed once.</p>
<p>She considered ignoring it. Her boundaries were sacred.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>She reached for it anyway.</p>
<p>New Message: R. Vidal<br/>10:44 PM</p>
<p>Today was productive.<br/>You didn't talk over me.<br/>Good start.</p>
<p>Agatha stared at the screen, one brow arching slightly.</p>
<p>Another message followed:</p>
<p>Also, tell Jennifer her jokes are terrible.<br/>And that she's lucky she's pretty.</p>
<p>Agatha's lips twitched. Against her will.</p>
<p>She typed a response. Deleted it.</p>
<p>Typed again. Paused.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p>Noted. I'll inform her of her conditional appeal.<br/>And thank you.<br/>For today.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Don't thank me.<br/>Earn it.</p>
<p>Agatha exhaled through a quiet smile.</p>
<p>She set the tablet down. Picked up her drink. Let the bourbon settle on her tongue and burn the edge of
                something far too warm.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, they'd be back in the lion's den.</p>
<p>But tonight?</p>
<p>Tonight she had a message from Rio Vidal.</p>
<p>And it tasted better than bourbon.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.rsgwgnbkzquw">Chapter Nine: The Optics of Power</h3>
<p>Three days later - Press Conference Room, Designation Task Force HQ. 11:00 AM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They hadn't planned to walk in together.</p>
<p>But when Rio stepped out of the elevator and Agatha was already waiting in the lobby, the only reasonable
                thing to do was to fall into stride beside her. Not ahead. Not behind.</p>
<p>Equal.</p>
<p>A beat too silent.</p>
<p>A beat too in sync.</p>
<p>The press turned as one.</p>
<p>Phones up. Cameras ready.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't look at Rio.</p>
<p>Rio didn't look at Agatha.</p>
<p>But they didn't need to.</p>
<p>The air around them spoke loud enough.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The press room lights were hot. The podium was set. Jennifer Kale leaned against the far wall, arms crossed,
                trying to look like she wasn't actively witnessing history (and potential sex).</p>
<p>Agatha stepped to the mic first.</p>
<p>Good posture. Controlled tone. Not warm, not cold. Measured.</p>
<p>"Thank you for being here. As director of the Designation Policy Task Force, I'm pleased to introduce our
                cross-designation leadership team, including our Submissive Liaison - "</p>
<p>She glanced to the side. Just once.</p>
<p>" - Dr. Rio Vidal."</p>
<p>Rio stepped forward.</p>
<p>There were murmurs.</p>
<p>She was calm. Still. Her blouse was ivory this time, tucked into slate-gray pants. No collar. No jewelry. Red
                lips.</p>
<p>She didn't look at the camera.</p>
<p>She looked straight at Agatha.</p>
<p>Then took the mic.</p>
<p>"I'm here because the system doesn't speak for people like me. And I'm tired of waiting for someone to give
                me the floor. So I'm taking it."</p>
<p>The room buzzed.</p>
<p>Agatha's expression didn't flicker. But the sharp-eyed reporters caught it - just the edge of her lips
                curving. Almost pride. Almost something more.</p>
<p>Rio continued, voice steady.</p>
<p>"If this task force works, it'll be because we stop pretending equality is a metaphor. It's not balance if
                only one side has the power. It's not harmony if one voice sings louder than the rest."</p>
<p>A click. A shutter.</p>
<p>Someone caught it - the moment Rio turned her head and Agatha, watching her, forgot to breathe.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Within minutes, Twitter (sorry, X) exploded.</p>
<p> #HarknessVidal<br/>#PowerCoupleEnergy<br/>#DomAndSubButMakeItProfessional<br/>#DidYouSeeThatLook
        </p>
<p>One viral video, slowed down, captioned:</p>
<p>"She didn't kneel. But Agatha looked like she might."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Back in the green room, Agatha handed Rio a bottle of water.</p>
<p>Rio took it without a word.</p>
<p>"You were brilliant," Agatha said softly.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Agatha almost smiled.</p>
<p>Rio drank, then said, deadpan: "We're trending."</p>
<p>"I'm aware."</p>
<p>"Someone tagged me in a poll. "Would you kneel for Dr. Vidal?'"</p>
<p>Agatha blinked. "What were the results?"</p>
<p>"Seventy-two percent said yes. Six percent said "already am.' One brave soul said "only if Harkness
                watches.'"</p>
<p>Agatha coughed once into her hand. "Charming."</p>
<p>"I said I'd allow it."</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes flicked up.</p>
<p>Rio smiled, slow and sharp.</p>
<p>"Not them. You."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.130mv1niu0ha">Chapter Ten: Not Them. You.</h3>
<p>Same moment - Green Room, seconds after the hit.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha blinked once.</p>
<p>Just once.</p>
<p>But in Agatha Harkness language, it was the equivalent of tripping down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Rio had already gone back to sipping her water, like she hadn't just weaponized the air between them. Like
                she hadn't just slipped a match between Agatha's ribs and lit it with eye contact.</p>
<p>Agatha cleared her throat. Useless. Her voice still came out low. "You're enjoying this."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be?" Rio asked. "It's the first time I've ever been allowed to terrify people legally. "</p>
<p>"I meant me," Agatha said before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>Rio turned.</p>
<p>That smile again - soft on the surface, serrated underneath.</p>
<p>"Oh, Director," she said, just a little too close, just a little too quiet. "You've always terrified me."</p>
<p>She let the word sit.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>"Isn't that why I'm here?"</p>
<p>Agatha's throat worked.</p>
<p>She could say something snarky. She could reassert dominance. Laugh it off. Tell Rio to behave.</p>
<p>She didn't.</p>
<p>Instead, she looked at her for a long moment, then said - truthfully, quietly - </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Rio tilted her head. "No?"</p>
<p>"You're here," Agatha said, "because the system fears you. And because I don't."</p>
<p>Rio studied her.</p>
<p>There was a flicker - something unreadable in her eyes. Then she smiled again, smaller this time. Genuine.
        </p>
<p>She stepped closer.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't move.</p>
<p>Rio reached out. Not to touch - just to adjust the lapel of Agatha's jacket. The contact was barely there.
                More suggestion than action.</p>
<p>"Liar," she whispered.</p>
<p>And then she walked out.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha stood there a moment too long.</p>
<p>Jennifer poked her head in five seconds later.</p>
<p>"You look like you've seen God."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't look at her.</p>
<p>She just murmured, "No. Just temptation."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.qlpry8p4pq0q">Chapter Eleven: Drag Me, Bestie</h3>
<p>Later that night - Alice's apartment. Takeout boxes. Empty wine glasses. Bad decisions pending.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>"So..." Alice said, drawing the word out like a threat. "How was the big press debut?"</p>
<p>Rio stabbed a dumpling with unnecessary force. "Fine."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. You went viral. Again."</p>
<p>"Not my fault people are thirsty."</p>
<p>"Oh no," Alice said, wide-eyed and fake-serious. "You mean to tell me that when a hot, dominant-coded
                Submissive stood next to a perfectly-coiffed iceberg in heels, the entire internet lost its collective
                mind? Shocking."</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes. "I did my job."</p>
<p>"You flirted with your job."</p>
<p>"I was making a point."</p>
<p>"You were making Agatha Harkness short-circuit. On camera."</p>
<p>Rio tried a different tactic: silence. Which would've been fine... if Alice didn't already know her too well.
        </p>
<p>"Alright," Alice said, flopping dramatically across the couch, "you have exactly five seconds to tell me what
                happened after the briefing or I'm calling Jen Kale and making her guess. Out loud. With voice notes."
        </p>
<p>Rio glared. "You're a goblin."</p>
<p>Alice grinned. "A persistent one. Now spill."</p>
<p>Rio stared at her takeout box. Then, muttered: "I said something dumb."</p>
<p>"Define "dumb.'"</p>
<p>"I may have... made a joke."</p>
<p>Alice sat up. "A joke? Oh god. Did you quote that poll?"</p>
<p>"I said... I'd allow it."</p>
<p>Alice blinked. "Allow what?"</p>
<p>Rio didn't answer.</p>
<p>Alice's eyes narrowed. "Rio."</p>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<p>Then, softly, like a confession: "I said... not them. You."
        </p>
<p>Alice gasped. Full, dramatic gasp. "You saucy menace."</p>
<p>"I panicked!"</p>
<p>"That's not panic. That's foreplay."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it."</p>
<p>"You meant it so hard I think the drywall heard it."</p>
<p>Rio groaned and covered her face. "I'm going to die."</p>
<p>"No you're not," Alice said, gleefully. "You're going to fall into bed with her and I'm going to win so many
                bets."</p>
<p>"There are bets?"</p>
<p>"Sweetie. There's a spreadsheet. "</p>
<p>Rio dropped her hands and stared. "I hate you."</p>
<p>Alice beamed. "You love me. And don't worry - I made sure you're the favorite."</p>

<p></p>
<h3 id="h.j5kaadcfoc1s">Chapter Twelve: A Little Message</h3>
<p>Agatha's apartment - 11:41 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The apartment was, as always, immaculate.</p>
<p>Low lighting. A single reading lamp over the chaise. Glass of wine untouched beside her. A book in her lap -
                something dense, political, and wildly unreadable by anyone but her.</p>
<p>She hadn't turned the page in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Not since she opened her tablet.</p>
<p>Not since she searched her own name and found a grainy, paused video frame of herself watching Rio at the
                press briefing.</p>
<p>The internet had... opinions.</p>
<p>"The way she looks at her like she's trying not to kneel. I'm unwell."<br/>"Someone check the room temp,
                because that tension is FLAMMABLE."<br/>"If they don't fuck by the midseason finale, I'm suing."</p>
<p>She set the tablet aside.</p>
<p>Closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Took a breath.</p>
<p>It didn't help.</p>
<p>She could still hear Rio's voice, cool and devastating:</p>
<p>"Not them. You."</p>
<p>It wasn't even a line. It was a decision. A choice. And the worst part? Agatha had no idea if Rio meant it.
        </p>
<p>Or if she'd ever say it again.</p>
<p>She reached for her wine.</p>
<p>The tablet buzzed.</p>
<p>Agatha stared at it like it had spoken in tongues.</p>
<p>New message.</p>
<p>From: R. Vidal<br/>Sent: 11:39 PM</p>
<p>Rewatched the briefing.<br/>You didn't interrupt me once.<br/>New record?
        </p>
<p>Agatha's lips curved.</p>
<p>Slow. Subtle. Real.</p>
<p>She typed back.</p>
<p>It's early in the season. Don't get cocky.</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then Rio again:</p>
<p>Too late.<br/>Also, your jacket today? Illegal.</p>
<p>Agatha blinked. Actually blushed.</p>
<p>She typed a reply. Deleted it. Then gave up and sent:</p>
<p>Yours was worse.<br/>People are still tweeting about your pants.</p>
<p>A long pause.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Did you look?</p>
<p>Agatha stared.</p>
<p>Her heart didn't beat louder. That would imply she had one.</p>
<p>Still. Her thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p>Yes.<br/>And if you wear them to the next meeting, I make no promises about my self-control.</p>
<p>The read receipt flicked on.</p>
<p>Then nothing.</p>
<p>For ten seconds.</p>
<p>Then twenty.</p>
<p>Then - </p>
<p>Good.<br/>I want you distracted.</p>
<p>Agatha leaned back, heart quiet but heavy.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>Oh no, she thought.</p>
<p>I'm in trouble.</p>

<h3 id="h.49zwhaph08ta">Chapter Thirteen: Strategic Threats (and Tight Pants)
        </h3>
<p>Task Force HQ - Two days later. 9:00 AM sharp.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The meeting room was already full when Rio walked in.</p>
<p>She wasn't late.</p>
<p>She just liked to arrive after people were settled - less a power move, more a calculated disruption. And
                this time?</p>
<p>Oh, she brought war.</p>
<p>Slate-gray slacks. Same cut as the press briefing. Just tighter. Just a hint more stretch. Paired with a
                crisp white button-down tucked in so neatly it bordered on obscene. Hair down. Red lipstick like she
                knew exactly who she was hunting.</p>
<p>She didn't scan the room.</p>
<p>She looked at Agatha.</p>
<p>Dead-on. Zero hesitation.</p>
<p>Agatha - mid-sip of coffee - froze for half a breath.</p>
<p>Then resumed.</p>
<p>Her face didn't move. But her grip on the mug? Visibly tighter.</p>
<p>Jennifer Kale, seated two chairs over, watched the exchange like a tennis match. She leaned toward Alice and
                whispered, "Five bucks says Agatha speaks three octaves lower today."</p>
<p>Alice whispered back, "Ten bucks says she forgets how to speak entirely."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha opened the meeting with her usual control.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>"Thank you all for coming," she said, smooth as polished glass. "We'll begin with the agenda - project
                milestones, media strategy, designation equity analytics."</p>
<p>She glanced toward Rio.</p>
<p>Too long.</p>
<p>Rio was already sitting, ankles crossed, arms casually resting on the table like she hadn't just walked in
                like a goddamn power fantasy.</p>
<p>Agatha blinked once.</p>
<p>"Dr. Vidal," she said, almost too softly. "Would you care to lead the metrics overview?"</p>
<p>Rio tilted her head. "I would."</p>
<p>She stood. Walked slowly to the front. The room quieted.</p>
<p>Agatha tracked every step.</p>
<p>Rio could feel it - like a physical touch between her shoulder blades.</p>
<p>The presentation was flawless. Concise. Sharp. She cited data offhand like she wrote it in her sleep. She
                tore apart one of the pilot program frameworks - respectfully - and offered a better alternative without
                blinking.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't interrupt.</p>
<p>She also didn't breathe.</p>
<p>At one point, Rio turned to her directly and said, "Director Harkness, would you agree this model gives Subs
                more than symbolic input?"</p>
<p>Agatha's throat bobbed.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "It's... more than symbolic."
        </p>
<p>Rio smiled. "Good. I don't do symbolism."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The meeting ended.</p>
<p>People filed out.</p>
<p>Jennifer lingered, of course.</p>
<p>"So," she said to Agatha, who was pretending to organize papers. "How's your blood pressure?"</p>
<p>"Normal."</p>
<p>"Liar."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't look up. "She's just... making a point."
        </p>
<p>"Oh, she made it. In four-way stretch. With tailored seams."</p>
<p>Agatha finally looked up, deadly calm. "Do you have a point, Jennifer?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Jen said brightly. "You're going to crack, and I can't wait."</p>
<p>She left whistling.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha turned back to the table.</p>
<p>Rio's notes were still there.</p>
<p>So was a folded Post-It.</p>
<p>Agatha unfolded it slowly.</p>
<p>"Eyes up next time. Or don't. I don't mind."<br/>- R</p>
<p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p>
<p>And muttered, "Fuck."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.fqapvspthqzm">Beneath the Surface - Agatha's Spiral (Internally, of Course)</h3>
<p>Agatha Harkness has built her entire identity on mastery. Of her job. Her image. Her voice, never raised. Her
                hands, always steady. Dominants aren't supposed to waver - and especially not around Submissives.</p>
<p>But Rio?</p>
<p>Rio is a fucking threat. Not because she disrespects her - no, worse - because she sees her. Cuts through
                every layer of performance with a glance. A whisper. A tailored pair of pants and a dry comment at the
                end of a meeting.</p>
<p>Every nerve in Agatha's body wants to respond.</p>
<p>But she can't.</p>
<p>She won't.</p>
<p>Because to respond would mean acknowledging that Rio has power over her.</p>
<p>And she doesn't know how to want something without owning it.</p>
<p>But Rio? Rio won't be owned. She won't kneel. She doesn't have to.</p>
<p>And that's why Agatha is unraveling - because she's starting to want her on Rio's terms.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.7f5svqigoqzu">Back in Her Office...</h3>
<p>12:17 PM. The meeting's been over for thirty minutes. Agatha is still sitting at her desk. The Post-It note
                is face down beside her tablet. Her jaw is tight enough to crack teeth.
        </p>
<p>She's tried to answer six emails.</p>
<p>She's failed to answer six emails.</p>
<p>Her leg is crossed too tightly. Her grip on her stylus has gone white-knuckle. Her thoughts are not...
                thoughts. They're images.</p>
<p>The curve of Rio's hip in those pants.</p>
<p>The way she said "I don't do symbolism."</p>
<p>The way she turned that performance into a challenge.
        </p>
<p>Agatha exhales through her nose. Controlled. Precise. Not at all the sound of someone who is trying very hard
                not to slide her hand under her desk and - </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>She stands.</p>
<p>Paces.</p>
<p>Glares at her own reflection in the window.</p>
<p>"This is nothing," she says out loud.</p>
<p>It echoes back like a lie.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 id="h.w9g1xs28llnh">She Picks Up the Post-It Again.</h3>
<p>Reads it.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>"Eyes up next time. Or don't. I don't mind."</p>
<p>She types a message to Rio.</p>
<p>Deletes it.</p>
<p>Types another one.</p>
<p>Deletes that too.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p>Was it intentional?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>She opens a folder titled TASK FORCE: LEGAL just to have something on the screen when Jennifer inevitably
                barges in.</p>
<p>But her eyes drift.</p>
<p>Back to the message.</p>
<p>Back to the memory of Rio standing there, cool and sharp and knowing.</p>
<p>She doesn't want Rio to know what she does to her.</p>
<p>But she suspects... she already does.</p>

<h3 id="h.1f1jlb6xnyq9">Chapter Fourteen: Dangerous Thoughts</h3>
<p>Rio's apartment - 12:45 PM. Half a sandwich. Full spiral.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio had come home for lunch.</p>
<p>She'd told herself it was to avoid the cafeteria.</p>
<p>But really?</p>
<p>She needed space. Air. Time.</p>
<p>Because her mind wouldn't stop replaying.</p>
<p>The way Agatha's eyes tracked her every step.</p>
<p>The pause. The silence. The tension in her jaw when Rio asked if she'd looked.</p>
<p>And that note - God, the note - had been a risk. A power play she'd written with a steady hand and a wildly
                unsteady heartbeat.</p>
<p>And now?</p>
<p>Now she couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>Because a very stupid, very buried part of her had wanted Agatha to take it as an invitation.</p>
<p>Not just flirt back.</p>
<p>Not just look.</p>
<p>Act.</p>
<p>Bend her. Break her. Pin her down in a way that didn't strip her of power but honored it - claimed it.</p>
<p>Rio had spent her entire adult life building a fortress around her designation. Not for safety. For freedom.
                To keep herself above the power plays. To avoid exactly this.</p>
<p>But Agatha?</p>
<p>Agatha made her want to lose.</p>
<p>Not to everyone.</p>
<p>Just to her.</p>
<p>And that was dangerous. That was nuclear.</p>
<p>She stared at her phone. No new messages. No follow-up. No pushback.</p>
<p>She almost felt... disappointed.</p>
<p>Which was deranged. That was the one thing she couldn't want - submission to someone who could bury her
                career, who could make her feel like an object, who had once let her go.</p>
<p>But that was the problem, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Agatha hadn't forced anything.</p>
<p>She never did.</p>
<p>And that was the most dangerous part of all.</p>
<p>Because Rio could feel herself wanting to offer.</p>
<p>And if she offered, if she gave Agatha the smallest piece of that control...
        </p>
<p>She wouldn't take it back.</p>

<h3 id="h.u2lu8lp9q12">Chapter Fifteen: Bait Taken</h3>
<p>Agatha's Office - 1:08 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She hadn't moved in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>The legal folder was still open on her screen, untouched. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, still
                useless. She'd re-read the Post-It four times and told herself she was above responding.</p>
<p>That this wasn't anything.</p>
<p>That Rio Vidal couldn't crawl under her skin with tailored pants and a dare in lipstick.</p>
<p>And she'd almost believed it.</p>
<p>Until her tablet lit up.</p>
<p>New Message: R. Vidal<br/>1:07 PM</p>
<p>Let me ask you something.<br/>Do you want to break me?</p>
<p>Agatha's heart stopped.</p>
<p>No salutation.</p>
<p>No context.</p>
<p>Just seven words.</p>
<p>Seven words that detonated something low and deep and dangerous.</p>
<p>Her first thought was: No.</p>
<p>Her second thought was: God, yes.</p>
<p>But neither was the right answer.</p>
<p>Because she didn't want to break Rio.</p>
<p>She wanted Rio to shatter - on purpose. For her. With her.</p>
<p>She sat forward.</p>
<p>Re-read the message. Carefully. Again.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, deliberately, she typed:</p>
<p>Not unless you beg me to.</p>
<p>Sent.</p>
<p>No edit. No delay.</p>
<p>If Rio wanted to play with fire, Agatha would stop pretending her hands weren't already burned.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.4vi7w6jx7twk">Meanwhile - Rio's Apartment.</h3>
<p>She'd been pacing.</p>
<p>The message had been a mistake. She knew it the second she hit send.</p>
<p>Too raw. Too true.</p>
<p>But she hadn't expected the reply to come so fast.</p>
<p>She stared at her screen.</p>
<p>Not unless you beg me to.</p>
<p>Her mouth went dry.</p>
<p>Her knees buckled, just slightly.</p>
<p>Not from fear.</p>
<p>From want.</p>
<p>Because fuck.</p>
<p>She wanted to.</p>
<p>She wanted to get on her knees and ask. Not out of weakness - but because she trusted her. Because somewhere,
                deep down, she believed Agatha wouldn't take anything she didn't offer.</p>
<p>And suddenly, that want was a need.</p>
<p>She collapsed into the nearest chair, heart hammering.</p>
<p>Typed, slowly:</p>
<p>You assume I won't.</p>
<p>Sent.</p>
<p>Then threw her phone across the couch and covered her face.</p>

<h3 id="h.5bti4n5bk7tx">Chapter Sixteen: Permission</h3>
<p>Agatha's Office - 1:12 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The message hit like a pulse against her palm.</p>
<p>You assume I won't.</p>
<p>Agatha stared at the words, letting them settle - letting her settle.</p>
<p>There it was.<br/>The edge of surrender.</p>
<p>Not a fall. Not a collapse.</p>
<p>A decision.</p>
<p>And it lit her up.</p>
<p>Not because she wanted Rio on her knees, but because Rio had finally admitted - if only indirectly - that
                part of her wanted to kneel.</p>
<p>For Agatha.</p>
<p>And Agatha... would make that mean everything.
        </p>
<p>She opened a new message.</p>
<p>Typed. Slowly. Carefully. Each word deliberate.</p>
<p>When you do - <br/>I won't be gentle.<br/>I will ruin you so thoroughly you'll forget what it felt like not to
                belong to me.<br/>And you will thank me for every second.
        </p>
<p>Are you sure you're ready to beg, Dr. Vidal?</p>
<p>She didn't wait.</p>
<p>Send.</p>
<p>Then sat back in her chair and exhaled through her nose.</p>
<p>That was it. The line. The gauntlet.</p>
<p>She had shown her cards.</p>
<p>And now, it was Rio's move.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.n698r6rug28b">Chapter Seventeen: Yes</h3>
<p>Rio's Apartment - 1:14 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The reply came fast.</p>
<p>She'd barely sat back down, still flushed with adrenaline, when her phone lit up again.</p>
<p>From: A. Harkness<br/>Subject: Re: Do you want to break me?</p>
<p>When you do - <br/>I won't be gentle.<br/>I will ruin you so thoroughly you'll forget what it felt like not to
                belong to me.<br/>And you will thank me for every second.
        </p>
<p>Are you sure you're ready to beg, Dr. Vidal?</p>
<p>Rio didn't breathe.</p>
<p>Not for a full ten seconds.</p>
<p>Her pulse thundered in her ears. She could feel it in her wrists, her throat, between her thighs. Her fingers
                trembled around the edges of the phone, and still - still - she read the message three more times.</p>
<p>It wasn't crass. It wasn't crude.</p>
<p>It was a promise.</p>
<p>And worse - it was the exact promise her body had been aching for.</p>
<p>She squeezed her eyes shut and let her head fall back against the couch, lips parted on a breath she couldn't
                catch. Her hips shifted instinctively, searching for friction she'd never admit to craving.</p>
<p>She'd played at power. She'd used suggestion like a scalpel. She'd wanted to see Agatha falter.</p>
<p>But this?</p>
<p>This was Agatha unbound.</p>
<p>And now Rio was the one unraveling.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to beg?"</p>
<p>She hadn't been.</p>
<p>But now...</p>
<p>Her lips moved before she realized they had.</p>
<p>"Yes," she whispered, voice hoarse and wrecked and real.</p>
<p>There was no one there to hear her.</p>
<p>And still - it felt like a confession.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She stared at her screen.</p>
<p>Typed.</p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p>Typed again.</p>
<p>Deleted again.</p>
<p>Because this wasn't a message for work.</p>
<p>This was a turning point.</p>
<p>And she wasn't sure if she could come back from it.</p>
<p>But god, she wanted to fall.</p>
<p>She lifted the phone, hands shaking, and finally sent:</p>
<p>You're the only one I'd kneel for.</p>
<p>And I don't kneel halfway.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>

<p>Rio - 1:22 PM.</p>
<p>She didn't wait this time.</p>
<p>Didn't hover. Didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>Her thumbs moved like they already knew the answer.</p>
<p>You're the only one I'd kneel for.</p>
<p>And I wonder...<br/>Would you kneel for me?</p>
<p>Send.</p>
<p>She threw the phone onto the couch again - harder this time - and curled her fists into the fabric.</p>
<p>It was reckless.</p>
<p>It was real.</p>
<p>And it was hers.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.wbevmw30owpw">Agatha - 1:22 PM</h3>
<p>She heard the ping.</p>
<p>She was mid-sentence in an email she would never finish.</p>
<p>She didn't even blink. Just reached for the tablet with calm fingers and a firestorm under her skin.</p>
<p>The message opened.</p>
<p>You're the only one I'd kneel for.</p>
<p>And I wonder...<br/>Would you kneel for me?</p>
<p>Everything stopped.</p>
<p>Breath.</p>
<p>Thought.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>Agatha stared at the words like they were a cipher. Like if she looked long enough, they'd decode her.</p>
<p>She'd expected the surrender.</p>
<p>She had not expected the mirror.</p>
<p>Because that wasn't a tease.</p>
<p>It wasn't flirtation.</p>
<p>It was a challenge.</p>
<p>A call across the battlefield.</p>
<p>And it hit her in the chest like truth.</p>
<p>Because the answer wasn't no.</p>
<p>It wasn't even I don't know.</p>
<p>It was - quietly, furiously, terrifyingly - yes.</p>
<p>She could.</p>
<p>She would.</p>
<p>If Rio asked.</p>
<p>Not because she was weak.</p>
<p>But because Rio was the only person alive who might actually deserve it.</p>
<p>And that knowledge?</p>
<p>That knowing?</p>
<p>Was the first thing to shake her foundation.</p>

<p>Agatha's Office - 1:29 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She hadn't moved.</p>
<p>The message still glowed at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Would you kneel for me?</p>
<p>The cursor blinked inside a new message.</p>
<p>She started to type.</p>
<p>That's not how this works.</p>
<p>She stared at it.</p>
<p>Deleted it.</p>
<p>New draft:</p>
<p>I don't kneel.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p>New draft:</p>
<p>You're not ready for what it means if I say yes.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>She stared at it. It felt too sharp. Too vulnerable.</p>
<p>Backspace. Backspace. Backspace.</p>
<p>New draft:</p>
<p>If I kneel, you don't get back up until I say.</p>
<p>No. Too much. Too soon.</p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p>Another.</p>
<p>Ask me in person.</p>
<p>Better. But not enough.</p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, breathing slow, measured.</p>
<p>Her heart was anything but.</p>
<p>The truth was crawling up her spine like heat.</p>
<p>Because the real answer wasn't a game.</p>
<p>It wasn't a weapon.</p>
<p>It wasn't powerplay or provocation.</p>
<p>The real answer was:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>One word.</p>
<p>Complete.</p>
<p>Exposed.</p>
<p>Terrifying.</p>
<p>She hovered over the keyboard. Let it sit.</p>
<p>No punctuation. No decoration. Just - </p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>She reached for the send button.</p>
<p>Stopped.</p>
<p>Her finger hovered there.</p>
<p>She could feel it - the way it would shift everything. How that single word could unravel a dynamic she had
                so carefully controlled.</p>
<p>She deleted it.</p>
<p>Typed again.</p>
<p>Don't ask that unless you want to know.</p>
<p>Sent.</p>
<p>And immediately hated herself.</p>
<p>Because it was true, and it was cowardice.</p>
<p>She didn't say yes.</p>
<p>But she didn't say no.</p>
<p>And she knew - she knew - that Rio would read it exactly for what it was:</p>
<p>Permission.</p>

<h3 id="h.pufru6pkheny">Chapter Twenty: The Invitation</h3>
<p>Rio - 3:16 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She hadn't expected a real answer.</p>
<p>She'd expected evasion. Silence. Deflection wrapped in dominance.</p>
<p>But what she got instead?</p>
<p>Don't ask that unless you want to know.</p>
<p>Not a no.<br/>Not even close.
        </p>
<p>A line drawn in sand, not stone.</p>
<p>It made her spine straighten. It made something low and coiled in her belly pulse.<br/>It made her want to
                test the edges.</p>
<p>Because Agatha Harkness was so goddamn careful with her words - and yet that one danced with promise. With
                permission.</p>
<p>So Rio picked up her phone.</p>
<p>Paused.</p>
<p>Then typed, slowly, carefully, like each letter mattered:</p>
<p>Meet me for dinner tonight.<br/>Somewhere neutral. Somewhere... honest.</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>Then added:</p>
<p>I'll wear something distracting. You can pretend not to look.</p>
<p>Send.</p>
<p>She set the phone down and didn't move.</p>
<p>If Agatha ignored it - fine.</p>
<p>If she made it a joke - fine.</p>
<p>But if she came?</p>
<p>Then Rio would know exactly how close she was to bringing her to her knees.

<h3 id="h.6zjnr4g126fn">Chapter Twenty-One: Appetite</h3>
<p>8:04 PM - A quiet, expensive restaurant. All low lighting and deep shadows. Table for two. Round. Intimate.
                No corners to hide in.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha arrived first.</p>
<p>Of course she did.</p>
<p>She always arrived first. Always controlled the terrain. It wasn't strategy; it was reflex.</p>
<p>She was dressed in black again - sharp lines, silk blouse, suit tailored to godhood. Her lipstick tonight was
                the same color as want: dark, precise, dangerous.</p>
<p>She hadn't eaten all day.</p>
<p>She'd told herself it was nerves.</p>
<p>It wasn't.</p>
<p>She was waiting.</p>
<p>And then Rio walked in.</p>
<p>And the room got smaller.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She wasn't trying to make a scene - but God, she didn't have to try.</p>
<p>A fitted dress. Dark green. No sleeves. No jewelry again. Hair half-up, mouth soft and red and smug as sin.
        </p>
<p>And Agatha?</p>
<p>Agatha forgot her own name for half a second.</p>
<p>Rio crossed the floor like she owned it.</p>
<p>Sat down like she owned Agatha.</p>
<p>"You're early," she said, voice low, almost amused.</p>
<p>"You said dinner," Agatha replied. "I take punctuality seriously."</p>
<p>Rio's smile was lazy. Lethal. "And here I thought you were just eager to see me."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't respond.</p>
<p>She didn't have to.</p>
<p>Her eyes said everything.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They ordered.</p>
<p>They barely touched their drinks.</p>
<p>They barely touched anything.</p>
<p>Because every inch of the space between them was charged - like two storms circling each other, waiting for
                the first flash.</p>
<p>"I expected you to say no," Rio murmured, swirling her wine.</p>
<p>"I nearly did," Agatha said, fingers curled around her glass.</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>Agatha's gaze lifted. Steady. "You asked... honestly."</p>
<p>Rio's expression flickered. "So this is honesty?"</p>
<p>Agatha leaned forward, just enough to close the distance.</p>
<p>"This is restraint," she said. "Honesty would get us arrested."</p>
<p>Rio laughed. Quiet. Breathless. Wrecked.</p>
<p>"You keep talking like that and I'm going to crawl under this table."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't smile.</p>
<p>But her voice dropped like velvet on skin.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't make it halfway."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Thick. Heady. Electric.</p>
<p>Rio's knees pressed together. Her throat worked once, just once.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't want this," she said softly, not looking away.
        </p>
<p>"I know," Agatha said, just as soft.</p>
<p>They sat there, still, hearts hammering loud enough to be heard in the spaces between their words.</p>
<p>Then Rio leaned back.</p>
<p>Gathered herself.</p>
<p>Lifted her glass and said, almost casually:</p>
<p>"Well. Here's to bad decisions."</p>
<p>Agatha clinked her glass against hers. Voice like a promise:</p>
<p>"To the last one either of us makes alone."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.d3b9102qgeek">Chapter Twenty-Two: The Door</h3>
<p>10:41 PM - Rio's apartment building. City quiet. Heat rising from the pavement. Air between them: electric.
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>They didn't speak much on the way there.</p>
<p>A shared car. Not a word. Just glances like slow strokes. The kind of silence that says I'm already touching
                you in my head. The kind of silence that makes it impossible to breathe.</p>
<p>And now?</p>
<p>Now they stood at her door.</p>
<p>Agatha hadn't been invited up.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>But she hadn't walked away either.</p>
<p>And Rio - God, Rio wasn't sure she remembered how to open the door. Her keys were in her hand, but her
                fingers were useless.</p>
<p>Agatha stood behind her. Close. Not touching.</p>
<p>But the heat of her was devastating.</p>
<p>"I don't usually do this," Rio said.</p>
<p>Her voice was too quiet.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice came behind her - low, steady, just this side of frayed.</p>
<p>"Neither do I."</p>
<p>Rio turned slightly.</p>
<p>"Liar."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then Agatha stepped forward, just enough to let her mouth brush Rio's ear.</p>
<p>"I don't usually want like this."</p>
<p>That broke something.</p>
<p>Rio turned fully - back against the door now. Looking up at her.</p>
<p>And Agatha... looked wrecked.</p>
<p>Her composure was there, technically, but barely holding. Her lips were parted. Her pupils blown. Her
                breathing just a little too shallow for someone pretending they were in control.
        </p>
<p>Rio swallowed. "If I ask you in..."</p>
<p>Agatha met her eyes.</p>
<p>"You won't have to."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Breath.</p>
<p>Choice.</p>
<p>Rio reached behind her, turned the knob, and pushed the door open.</p>
<p>Then stepped aside.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't move.</p>
<p>Not at first.</p>
<p>Then she stepped inside, slowly.</p>
<p>And when Rio followed her in - closed the door, turned, and just looked at her - </p>
<p>Agatha's restraint snapped like a thread.</p>
<p>She was on her in one breath.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>

<p>Rio's apartment - 10:45 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The door hadn't even clicked shut before Agatha's hands were on her - <br/>Palming Rio's jaw. Pressing her
                back into the wood with a hunger that felt like she'd been starving for years and just now remembered
                how to eat.</p>
<p>Rio gasped against her mouth, and Agatha drank the sound like water.<br/>One hand tangled in Agatha's hair.
                The other dug into the sharp line of her jacket.</p>
<p>"You're so fucking controlled," Rio hissed between kisses.<br/>"Not with you," Agatha breathed, before sealing
                their mouths again.</p>
<p>They didn't make it far.</p>
<p>Ten steps in, Agatha shoved her gently - carefully - against the wall just past the entryway, and Rio moaned
                into her mouth.<br/>Her hands were everywhere now - gripping Rio's waist, sliding under the fabric of her
                dress, clawing toward skin.</p>
<p>"I want - " Agatha started, but she didn't finish.</p>
<p>Didn't need to.</p>
<p>Rio could feel it in the way her breath hitched, in the way her hips rolled forward without apology.<br/>She
                was unraveling, already.<br/>And Rio had barely even touched her yet.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the blur of lips and teeth and groaning, Rio pushed off the wall.
        </p>
<p>"Bedroom," she said, voice ragged. "Now."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't argue.</p>
<p>Didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>She followed like gravity.</p>
<p>Like she didn't know how to walk anywhere else.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.khn78ksycaw9">The Bedroom</h3>
<p>The lights were off. Moonlight spilling through the window.</p>
<p>Rio stopped just inside.<br/>Agatha came up behind her - fingers skimming her spine, lips brushing her
                shoulder.</p>
<p>But before she could press closer - </p>
<p>"Don't," Rio said.</p>
<p>Agatha froze.</p>
<p>Rio turned.<br/>Face flushed. Breathing heavy.</p>
<p>But her eyes?</p>
<p>Her eyes were clear.</p>
<p>And the voice that followed?</p>
<p>Low. Commanding. Calm as still water.</p>
<p>"Kneel."</p>
<p>Agatha's heart stopped.</p>
<p>She didn't ask why.<br/>Didn't question.</p>
<p>She just... did.</p>
<p>She sank.</p>
<p>Slow. Controlled. Intentional.</p>
<p>Her knees hit the floor like a prayer.</p>
<p>And when she looked up?</p>
<p>Rio was watching her with something between wonder and hunger.</p>
<p>"Good girl," she whispered.</p>
<p>Agatha's breath caught.</p>
<p>And then - finally - Rio moved to her.<br/>Put her hands in Agatha's hair.</p>
<p>And tugged.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.h3owmhnfj7gw">Chapter Twenty-Four: I Never Kneel</h3>
<p>Agatha's knees pressed into the soft rug, her hands resting lightly at her thighs.</p>
<p>She should've felt exposed.</p>
<p>Powerless.</p>
<p>But instead?</p>
<p>She had never felt more dangerous.</p>
<p>Because this?</p>
<p>This wasn't Rio's victory.</p>
<p>This was Agatha's devotion.</p>
<p>Her eyes burned upward, locked on Rio's face.</p>
<p>"I've never knelt for anyone before," she said.</p>
<p>Her voice was a low rasp. Not fragile. Reverent.</p>
<p>Rio's breath caught.</p>
<p>"Agatha - "</p>
<p>"I don't kneel for show," she went on. Her hands came up slowly, resting against the backs of Rio's thighs.
                "I don't kneel for games. I don't kneel for Dominants. Or titles. Or history."</p>
<p>She leaned in.</p>
<p>Mouth brushing the line of fabric where Rio's dress ended, just above her hips.</p>
<p>"I kneel," Agatha said, dragging her lips lower, "for you."</p>
<p>Rio's knees nearly buckled.</p>
<p>She reached out, fingers threading into Agatha's hair - tight, but not pulling.</p>
<p>"You're not - " she tried, breathless, "you're not mine."</p>
<p>Agatha's teeth caught the waistband of Rio's underwear.</p>
<p>And pulled.</p>
<p>"Then tell me to stop," she whispered.</p>
<p>Rio didn't.</p>
<p>Couldn't.</p>
<p>Agatha's hands slid up, catching the edge of the fabric. Slowly - achingly - she peeled the last barrier
                down, not with her hands, but with her mouth.</p>
<p>Inch by inch.</p>
<p>Never breaking eye contact.</p>
<p>"I could spend the rest of my life right here," she murmured, voice wrecked. "Tasting how you ruin me."
        </p>
<p>Rio groaned - sharp, raw, desperate - and stumbled back until her thighs hit the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Agatha followed on her knees, like gravity itself.</p>
<p>Still looking up at her.</p>
<p>Still waiting for permission.</p>
<p>But her mouth was already so close - </p>
<p>And Rio?</p>
<p>She gave it.</p>
<p>Just one word, wrecked and reverent:</p>
<p>"Please."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.28skbgr8m21i">Chapter Twenty-Five: Worship</h3>
<p>Rio's thighs hit the edge of the bed, breath caught in her throat, fingers still tangled in Agatha's hair.
        </p>
<p>And Agatha - on her knees, suit wrinkled, lipstick smudged - looked up at her like she was witnessing
                divinity.</p>
<p>"I've thought about this," she said softly. Her voice had dropped, velvet over steel. "So many times. But
                never like this."</p>
<p>She kissed the inside of Rio's thigh.</p>
<p>Just once.</p>
<p>Then again. Higher.</p>
<p>"I never imagined I'd be grateful to kneel."</p>
<p>Her hands slid up, slow and reverent, palms gliding over the swell of Rio's ass, pulling her just a little
                closer.</p>
<p>Rio trembled.</p>
<p>Agatha's mouth brushed against her now-bare cunt - light, teasing, maddening.</p>
<p>Rio whimpered.</p>
<p>Agatha smiled.</p>
<p>Then kissed her there - deep and warm and full.</p>
<p>Like she meant it.</p>
<p>Like it was an offering.</p>
<p>And then her tongue moved. Long, slow strokes that bordered on reverent. No rush. No pattern. Just
                exploration - learning what made Rio gasp, what made her twitch, what made her grip Agatha's hair like
                she'd never let go.</p>
<p>Rio's knees nearly buckled again, but Agatha caught her with firm hands - kept her upright while her mouth
                worked downward , deeper, slower.
        </p>
<p>"You're already shaking," Agatha murmured against her. "And I've barely started."</p>
<p>Rio tried to answer.</p>
<p>She failed.</p>
<p>Agatha sucked gently at her clit, then flattened her tongue against it - just right - and Rio moaned so
                loudly it echoed off the walls.</p>
<p>"You're beautiful like this," Agatha whispered. "Open. Shaking. Needing."</p>
<p>She slid her tongue lower again, into her, deep and slow, and Rio gasped, the word "fuck - " slipping from
                her lips like a sob.
        </p>
<p>Agatha's mouth kept moving. Gentle. Steady. Unrelenting.</p>
<p>Her grip stayed firm on Rio's hips, holding her in place even as she bucked against her face - chasing more,
                needing more.</p>
<p>"Please," Rio whispered, breathless.</p>
<p>Agatha hummed against her, the vibration pulling another cry from Rio's throat.</p>
<p>"You can take it," Agatha said. "Let me."</p>
<p>She worked her tongue faster now, lips slick and eager, moaning softly with each stroke like she was the one
                being undone.</p>
<p>And Rio?</p>
<p>Rio came hard.</p>
<p>Hands fisted in Agatha's hair, hips jerking forward, a strangled moan torn from her throat.</p>
<p>But Agatha didn't stop.</p>
<p>She didn't let her go.</p>
<p>She pulled her closer.</p>
<p>Held her there.</p>
<p>Started over.</p>
<p>Licking her through it. Into it. Again.</p>
<p>"Too much," Rio gasped. "Too - fuck - too much - "</p>
<p>"No," Agatha said. "Not yet."</p>
<p>She looked up, pupils dark, lips slick, voice hoarse and hungry.</p>
<p>"I want to watch you fall apart."</p>
<p>She sucked her clit again - harder this time - and Rio screamed, hand flying to her mouth to muffle it, legs
                shaking violently.</p>
<p>And then - </p>
<p>"Agatha - "</p>
<p>"Say it."</p>
<p>"Agatha - please - "</p>
<p>"Say it."</p>
<p>Rio's entire body arched, tears welling in her eyes, chest heaving.</p>
<p>And then it broke.</p>
<p>"I need you to fuck me."</p>
<p>Agatha's breath caught.</p>
<p>The words landed like a thunderclap.</p>
<p>Rio's eyes were wild, desperate, bare.</p>
<p>"Please," she begged. "Take me. Now."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.jdcsx0lo9tr7">Chapter Twenty-Six: Ruin Me Softly</h3>
<p>Rio was still trembling, chest heaving, legs barely holding her upright.</p>
<p>Agatha rose from her knees like the tide - slow, inevitable, eyes never leaving her.</p>
<p>She was flushed, lips swollen, hair mussed where Rio had gripped it - but her expression?</p>
<p>Pure command.</p>
<p>Gentle. Focused. Hungry.</p>
<p>She pressed her body to Rio's, hand sliding up her spine, tilting her chin so they were nose to nose.</p>
<p>"You did so well for me," Agatha whispered, voice low and wrecked.
        </p>
<p>Rio whimpered.</p>
<p>"I'm not done with you."</p>
<p>She kissed her - deep, slow, grounding. Her hand gripped Rio's hip, fingers digging in just enough to anchor
                her.</p>
<p>Then she whispered against her lips: "Lie back. Legs open."</p>
<p>Rio obeyed instantly.</p>
<p>Fell onto the bed like gravity took her there. Spread open, flushed and soaked and aching.</p>
<p>Agatha followed - shed her jacket, pulled her blouse over her head with clinical precision. She didn't rush.
                She didn't need to.</p>
<p>This was hers now.</p>
<p>She climbed onto the bed, over Rio, and looked down like she was memorizing her.</p>
<p>Then, soft as a secret:</p>
<p>"Tell me what you need."</p>
<p>Rio swallowed. "You. Inside me. Please."</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her neck.</p>
<p>Her collarbone.</p>
<p>Her breast.</p>
<p>"I will," she promised. "But slow. You take every inch I give you. You don't rush. You feel it."</p>
<p>Rio nodded frantically. "Yes. Yes, please - "</p>
<p>Agatha reached between them, fingers slick with the aftermath of worship. She slid two fingers through Rio's
                folds, just to feel her shiver.</p>
<p>"So wet," she murmured. "You've been ready for me this whole time."</p>
<p>She pressed a finger inside. Slow. Deep.</p>
<p>Rio moaned - head thrown back, hands gripping the sheets.</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her throat, moving that finger with devastating rhythm - then added a second, curling just
                right.</p>
<p>"Agatha - oh my God - "</p>
<p>"You're mine now," Agatha whispered. "Mine to touch. Mine to please. Mine to ruin."</p>
<p>She pressed deeper, angled her fingers perfectly, kissed Rio's mouth as she fucked her slowly, steadily -
                watching her fall apart under the gentlest touch.</p>
<p>Every time Rio tried to move faster, Agatha's hand came down - lightly - to pin her hips.</p>
<p>"Easy," she whispered. "You'll take what I give you."</p>
<p>Rio sobbed - begged, incoherent now, legs shaking again.</p>
<p>Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio's, curling her fingers harder, deeper - </p>
<p>"Come for me."</p>
<p>And Rio did - loud, full-body, thighs clenching around Agatha's wrist, back arching off the bed.</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>Undone.</p>
<p>Destroyed.</p>
<p>But Agatha didn't stop.</p>
<p>She kept her fingers moving - gentle, slow, coaxing her through the aftershocks.</p>
<p>Then she withdrew carefully, kissed Rio's thigh, her stomach, her mouth.
        </p>
<p>"You're perfect," she whispered. "You did so well."</p>
<p>Rio blinked up at her, eyes glassy, body boneless.</p>
<p>"Fuck," she breathed. "You're dangerous."</p>
<p>Agatha smiled, slow and soft.</p>
<p>"No," she murmured, kissing her again.</p>
<p>"I'm yours."
        </p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.z9qwz3vzayul">Chapter Twenty-Seven: Imbalance</h3>
<p>Later that night - Rio's bed. The room is quiet. Her body is humming. Her thoughts won't stop.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha lay beside her.</p>
<p>One arm draped around her waist, thumb stroking lazily over Rio's bare hip. Her breathing was deep.
                Controlled.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>As if she hadn't just broken someone wide open with her mouth and voice alone.</p>
<p>Rio blinked at the ceiling, body warm, skin flushed, hair wild.</p>
<p>Wrecked.</p>
<p>She should've felt drunk on it. Sated. Floaty.</p>
<p>And she did.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>But underneath that glow, that pleasure still thick in her muscles - </p>
<p>There was a question.</p>
<p>It itched at her like a loose thread.</p>
<p>She turned slightly, enough to see Agatha's profile in the low light.
        </p>
<p>"Hey," she said softly.</p>
<p>Agatha's thumb paused, then resumed. "Mm?"</p>
<p>"You didn't..." Rio hesitated. "You didn't want anything for yourself?"</p>
<p>A slow breath.</p>
<p>Agatha's gaze shifted toward her.</p>
<p>"I wanted you."
        </p>
<p>Rio swallowed. "Yeah, I got that. Very clearly. I meant... physically."</p>
<p>Agatha was quiet for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then: "I didn't need it."</p>
<p>"That's not an answer."</p>
<p>Agatha smiled faintly. "It's the truth."</p>
<p>Rio rolled toward her fully now, propped on an elbow.</p>
<p>"Did you not want to? Or did you just not want to ask?"</p>
<p>That question landed.</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes were tired, but not guarded. Not now.</p>
<p>"I wanted to," she admitted. "Very much."</p>
<p>Rio's brow furrowed. "So why didn't you?"</p>
<p>Agatha's voice dropped to a murmur.</p>
<p>"Because you asked me to kneel."</p>
<p>Rio blinked.</p>
<p>"And when I did... that moment stopped being about me."</p>
<p>Her thumb traced Rio's waist again. Soft. Patient.</p>
<p>"You offered me your surrender. Your need. Your trust. I wasn't going to take anything that wasn't freely
                given in return."</p>
<p>Rio's throat tightened.</p>
<p>She searched Agatha's face.</p>
<p>"You really weren't holding back for control?"</p>
<p>"No," Agatha said. "I was holding back for you."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then softly, like a question and a confession in one:</p>
<p>"I'd rather have your trust than your body."</p>
<p>Rio closed her eyes for a beat. Her chest hurt in the good way.</p>
<p>And still, she whispered:</p>
<p>"You can have both."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't answer right away.</p>
<p>But when she kissed her - slow, deep, reverent - Rio felt the promise in it.</p>
<p>Not now.<br/>Not rushed.<br/>Not until Rio wanted to give it.</p>
<p>But Agatha would be ready.</p>
<p>And this time?</p>
<p>When Rio said please - <br/>It would be for her.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.rerlwqfw71i2">Chapter Twenty-Eight: Morning Service</h3>
<p>Rio's apartment - 7:26 AM. Quiet kitchen. Sunlight barely creeping across the tile.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha was standing at the stove.</p>
<p>Hair pulled back. Button-down borrowed from Rio's closet, sleeves rolled, cuffs just brushing her wrists.</p>
<p>She looked calm.</p>
<p>She always looked calm.
        </p>
<p>Coffee brewed behind her. She was chopping something - eggs? Herbs? Rio couldn't tell.</p>
<p>She leaned against the doorframe, barefoot, her body still singing with soreness and memory.</p>
<p>It should've felt domestic.</p>
<p>It didn't.</p>
<p>It felt dangerous.</p>
<p>Because Rio couldn't stop thinking about her on her knees.</p>
<p>And now all she wanted was to return the favor - not to reclaim control, but to show her how deeply she'd
                been claimed.</p>
<p>Quietly, Rio padded into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't turn.</p>
<p>"Good morning," she said, not looking up. "You didn't have to get up yet."</p>
<p>Rio's voice was hoarse. "I didn't want to miss you."
        </p>
<p>Agatha finally glanced back over her shoulder.</p>
<p>And froze.</p>
<p>Because Rio wasn't just standing behind her.</p>
<p>She was moving.</p>
<p>Slow. Intentional.</p>
<p>Coming closer.</p>
<p>Her arms slipped around Agatha's waist, hands resting low on her hips.
        </p>
<p>"I was thinking," Rio murmured, pressing a kiss just below her shoulder blade, "you spent all night making
                sure I didn't fall apart."</p>
<p>Another kiss. Lower.</p>
<p>"Seems only fair I try to return the favor."</p>
<p>Agatha stilled.</p>
<p>"Rio."</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to flip anything," she whispered. "I just want to make you feel good."</p>
<p>Her fingers slid lower.</p>
<p>Over the waistband of the borrowed shirt.</p>
<p>Under.</p>
<p>Agatha's breath caught.</p>
<p>"Let me?" Rio asked.</p>
<p>Her voice wasn't teasing.</p>
<p>It was reverent.</p>
<p>Agatha turned slowly, eyes searching hers.</p>
<p>She saw no challenge there.</p>
<p>Just devotion.</p>
<p>And that was what undid her.</p>
<p>Agatha nodded once.</p>
<p>And Rio sank to her knees.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.s967qcugtljz">Chapter Twenty-Nine: Redirection</h3>
<p>Rio's Kitchen - 7:28 AM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio's knees had barely touched the tile when Agatha's voice - low and sharp and shaken - cut through the air.
        </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Not cruel. Not angry.</p>
<p>Just immediate.</p>
<p>Like it hurt.</p>
<p>Rio froze. Looked up.</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes were wide. Her jaw clenched. Her hands trembling - not visibly, not really, but Rio could feel
                it in the air around her.</p>
<p>"I can't," Agatha said quietly. "Not like that."
        </p>
<p>Rio blinked. "I didn't mean - "</p>
<p>"I know." Agatha's hands found hers. Pulled her gently, but firmly, to her feet.</p>
<p>"I know what you meant," she whispered, thumb brushing the inside of Rio's wrist. "And I want it."</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>"But if you kneel for me, it means something."</p>
<p>She looked up, gaze dark and raw.</p>
<p>"If I kneel for you... it meant something."</p>
<p>Rio's heart twisted.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth to speak.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't let her.</p>
<p>She kissed her instead.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>Desperate.</p>
<p>Full of need.</p>
<p>And then - without breaking the kiss - she took Rio's hand and dragged her toward the couch.</p>
<p>Rio stumbled after her, dazed, aroused, soaked .</p>
<p>They barely made it past the kitchen before Agatha pushed her down onto the cushions.</p>
<p>"You want to take care of me?" she breathed, climbing into her lap.</p>
<p>"Then hold me down."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha didn't rush.</p>
<p>She straddled Rio's thighs, the open shirt slipping up just enough to reveal bare skin - only bare skin.</p>
<p>No underwear.</p>
<p>No barrier.</p>
<p>Just heat.</p>
<p>She rocked her hips once - testing. Feeling.</p>
<p>And Rio groaned.</p>
<p>"Fuck - Agatha - "</p>
<p>"You want to give me pleasure?" Agatha whispered, teeth grazing Rio's neck. "Then stay still and let me take
                it."</p>
<p>Rio whimpered.</p>
<p>Her hands slid up Agatha's thighs instinctively - but Agatha caught them.</p>
<p>Pushed them back.</p>
<p>"Just hold me."</p>
<p>And Rio did.</p>
<p>Agatha lined herself up.</p>
<p>Lowered slowly.</p>
<p>Sank down with a gasp - both of them moaning, gasping, shuddering as she took Rio all the way in.</p>
<p>Deep. Full.</p>
<p>Claimed.</p>
<p>And then she moved.</p>
<p>No rush.</p>
<p>Just long, slow grinds of her hips.</p>
<p>Back. Forward.</p>
<p>Down.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Using Rio's body for her pleasure.</p>
<p>Head tipped back. Mouth open. Breasts rising and falling with every breath.
        </p>
<p>And Rio?</p>
<p>She was a mess.</p>
<p>"God, you feel - fuck, you feel - "</p>
<p>"Perfect," Agatha whispered. "You feel perfect."</p>
<p>She picked up pace now, hips rolling faster, harder, fucking herself onto Rio with quiet, breathless control.
        </p>
<p>Moaning her name.</p>
<p>Hands in Rio's hair.</p>
<p>Her orgasm hit without warning - sharp, silent, devastating.</p>
<p>Her whole body tensed, clenched around Rio, breath stuttering in her throat.</p>
<p>And as she came, she leaned forward - </p>
<p>Wrapped her arms around Rio's neck - </p>
<p>And held on.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.4modvfygu2xn">Chapter Thirty: Truth, Inhaled</h3>
<p>The couch - later. The sun has crept further across the floor. Agatha is tucked into Rio's lap, her face
                pressed into the crook of her neck, the two of them still half-naked, fully tangled.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Neither of them had moved in minutes.</p>
<p>Agatha's breathing had slowed. Rio's fingers were tracing slow circles into her back - over the warm skin,
                the slight arch of her spine. Her other hand cradled Agatha's thigh, holding her in place even though
                she wasn't going anywhere.</p>
<p>Not now.</p>
<p>Maybe not ever.</p>
<p>But that thought?</p>
<p>Still too big to say.</p>
<p>So she didn't.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Instead - </p>
<p>"You scared me," Rio murmured, voice low.</p>
<p>Agatha shifted slightly, just enough to speak against her collarbone. "When?"</p>
<p>"When I went to my knees."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice was barely audible. "I know."</p>
<p>"You looked like you were going to break."</p>
<p>"I was."</p>
<p>Rio swallowed. "Why?"</p>
<p>Agatha lifted her head. Met her eyes. "Because it meant something."</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>Then another.</p>
<p>Rio nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said. "It did."</p>
<p>Agatha cupped her cheek gently, thumb brushing along the soft skin under her eye. "I didn't expect this."</p>
<p>"Me either."</p>
<p>"I didn't want to want you."</p>
<p>Rio smiled softly. "You're terrible at not wanting me."</p>
<p>Agatha huffed - barely a laugh. "You're infuriating."
        </p>
<p>"And you're impossible."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>And then, quietly, Rio added:</p>
<p>"But when you're inside me like that... when you look at me like I'm the only thing in the room..."</p>
<p>She trailed off. Swallowed.</p>
<p>"I've never felt more seen."</p>
<p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>Then pressed their foreheads together.</p>
<p>"I don't know if I'm ready to mark you," she whispered. "To claim. To collar."</p>
<p>Rio shook her head. "I'm not asking for that. Not yet."</p>
<p>A longer pause.</p>
<p>"But I think..." she breathed, "I might be ready to belong."</p>
<p>Agatha pulled back just enough to look at her.</p>
<p>The words caught between them.</p>
<p>Then Agatha kissed her - soft, slow, not possessive, not dominant.</p>
<p>Just present.</p>
<p>"I don't want you at my feet," she said.</p>
<p>"I want you next to me. "</p>
<p>Rio exhaled. Leaned her forehead back in.</p>
<p>They stayed there like that.</p>
<p>No titles.<br/>No roles.<br/>No performance.</p>
<p>Just two women - flushed, wrecked, warm - resting in the echo of something that wasn't quite claiming...</p>
<p>...but felt like the beginning of it.</p>

<p>Three days later - Task Force HQ. Coffee. Briefings. The illusion of control.</p>

<p>It had become a rhythm.</p>
<p>Mornings at Rio's apartment, Agatha making coffee like she'd always lived there.<br/>Meetings where they kept
                a perfectly professional distance - until a glance slipped, or a hand brushed too close.<br/>Private

                full of silence, laughter, need - and restraint.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>They worked.</p>
<p>Even Jen had stopped making snide comments - though that was less approval and more quiet awe.</p>
<p>Alice, of course, was insufferably smug.</p>
<p>"You're glowing," she'd said to Rio over lunch. "If you get any more post-Dom wrecked, HR's gonna call a
                wellness check."</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes. But she didn't deny it.</p>
<p>And Agatha?</p>
<p>Agatha was better than anyone had ever seen her.</p>
<p>Sharper. More human. Less frozen.</p>
<p>The task force was finally running like a machine.</p>
<p>Progress was happening.</p>
<p>Trust was building.</p>
<p>Which, of course, is when it happened.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.q47awrdm4evy">Chapter Thirty-Two: The Snag</h3>
<p>Internal policy review session. Cross-department liaisons present. Long table. Bottled water. Agatha at the
                head. Rio two seats down.</p>
<p>The room was full of noise.</p>
<p>A man - mid-fifties, stiff tie, career bureaucrat - was running through language on the latest designation
                equity draft. Dry. Technical. Utterly uninspired.</p>
<p>Rio raised a hand to interrupt, calm and clear.</p>
<p>"I actually think that clause reinforces the same dominance-assumed hierarchy we're trying to dismantle. You
                might consider flipping the subject-object construction."
        </p>
<p>The man barely glanced at her.</p>
<p>Then - </p>
<p>"I'm sure your perspective as a Submissive is emotionally invested, Dr. Vidal," he said. "But this requires
                policy nuance. Let's defer to Director Harkness for the real structural input."</p>
<p>The room froze.</p>
<p>It wasn't loud.<br/>It wasn't shouted.</p>
<p>But it was clear.</p>
<p>Dismissal.</p>
<p>Reduction.</p>
<p>Erasure.</p>
<p>Rio blinked once. Just once.</p>
<p>Her jaw didn't move. Her spine didn't break.</p>
<p>But something in her eyes darkened.</p>
<p>Agatha?</p>
<p>Agatha didn't move at first.</p>
<p>But her grip on the table tightened.</p>
<p>And then she spoke.</p>
<p>Cold. Flat.</p>
<p>"Dr. Vidal's input is structural. Nuanced. And correct."</p>
<p>She stood.</p>
<p>"If you dismiss her again, I'll have your badge before the next coffee break."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then: "Meeting adjourned."</p>
<p>She turned to Rio.</p>
<p>"Walk with me."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.nfzq7gx326nr">Chapter Thirty-Three: The Fire Beneath</h3>
<p>Moments later - Agatha's office. Door closed. Silence pulsing.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio paced.</p>
<p>Not back-and-forth. Not frantic.</p>
<p>Measured. Controlled. Lethal.</p>
<p>Agatha leaned against her desk, watching her carefully, arms crossed but jaw tense.</p>
<p>Rio's hands were shaking.</p>
<p>But her voice, when she spoke?</p>
<p>Still calm.</p>
<p>Still dangerous.</p>
<p>"That," she said, low and deliberate, "wasn't even the worst I've gotten."</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes narrowed slightly. "He's been like that before?"</p>
<p>Rio gave a sharp laugh. "Not him specifically. But men like him? All my fucking life."</p>
<p>She stopped pacing. Turned toward Agatha. Fire in her chest. No filter now.
        </p>
<p>"Do you know how exhausting it is to be the smartest person in the room and still have to prove you belong
                there every goddamn time you open your mouth?"</p>
<p>Agatha didn't answer. Just watched. Still. Steady.</p>
<p>Rio's voice cracked slightly - but not from weakness.</p>
<p>From the sheer effort of containment.</p>
<p>"I have to be flawless. Relentless. Calm. Measured. And even then? I'm still a Submissive first in their
                eyes. Not a doctor. Not a strategist. Just... a designation."</p>
<p>She clenched her jaw.</p>
<p>"And then you speak - and suddenly what I said matters."</p>
<p>Agatha shifted slightly. "I wasn't trying to speak for you - "</p>
<p>"I know," Rio snapped, voice sharp - but not at her. Never at her. "You were right. You were perfect."</p>
<p>She turned away again. Hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"It's not you I'm mad at."</p>
<p>Agatha stayed quiet.</p>
<p>Rio turned back slowly. Her eyes were wet but blazing.</p>
<p>"It's the system. The fucking structure. The fact that I need someone like you in the room just so they'll
                look at me like I exist."</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>Then softer.</p>
<p>"I'm not ashamed that you stood up for me."</p>
<p>She stepped closer.</p>
<p>"I'm just angry that it still had to happen."</p>
<p>Agatha exhaled.</p>
<p>Then reached out - slow, careful - hands gentle at Rio's elbows.
        </p>
<p>She pulled her in.</p>
<p>Held her.</p>
<p>Not to soothe.</p>
<p>Just to be there.</p>
<p>And Rio let her.</p>
<p>She sagged against her, forehead pressed to Agatha's collarbone, fists still clenched, chest still tight.</p>
<p>But for once?</p>
<p>She didn't have to hold it alone.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.dc1ya6272j1j">Chapter Thirty-Four: What Do You Need?</h3>
<p>Agatha didn't try to fix it.</p>
<p>She didn't fill the silence with reassurances or platitudes.</p>
<p>She just held Rio. Still. Quiet.</p>
<p>Until Rio's breathing evened out against her chest.</p>
<p>Only then did Agatha murmur - soft, level, the way she might ask someone what kind of tea they preferred:</p>
<p>"What do you need?"</p>
<p>It wasn't rhetorical.</p>
<p>It wasn't loaded.</p>
<p>It was genuine.</p>
<p>Rio stayed pressed against her for a moment longer.</p>
<p>Then pulled back just enough to meet her eyes.</p>
<p>"I need," she said carefully, "to be angry. For a while."</p>
<p>Agatha nodded.</p>
<p>"I need to say things, even if they make people uncomfortable."</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>"And I need you to keep being exactly who you are in rooms like that. Not because I need you to protect me.
                But because it's easier to burn things down when I know someone's holding the door open."</p>
<p>Agatha's lips quirked. Almost a smile. "That can be arranged."</p>
<p>Rio studied her.</p>
<p>Then leaned in.</p>
<p>Pressed a kiss to her cheek - gentle, lingering, grounding.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she whispered.</p>
<p>Agatha's hand found her waist. Rested there. Warm. Unmoving.</p>
<p>"You don't have to thank me for recognizing what you've always been," she said.</p>
<p>"But if you ever do want to burn something down..."</p>
<p>Her smile sharpened.</p>
<p>"You won't have to do it alone."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.jkjhbe7g8nx0">Chapter Thirty-Five: Reaching Back</h3>
<p>That night - Rio's apartment. Dim light. The quiet hum of city sounds through the window.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>The storm had passed.</p>
<p>She'd worked out the worst of the rage in the gym. In the shower. In the quiet hours alone on her couch with
                her legs tucked beneath her and a half-empty glass of wine warming her hand.</p>
<p>The anger had cooled.</p>
<p>But the ache hadn't.</p>
<p>She didn't need saving. She knew that.</p>
<p>But she wanted to be held.</p>
<p>And there was only one person she wanted it from.</p>
<p>So she reached for her phone.</p>
<p>Typed.</p>
<p>Deleted.</p>
<p>Typed again.</p>
<p>Sent.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Still angry. Still exhausted.<br/>But I keep thinking about your hands on me.<br/>Not to hold me back. Just to
                hold me steady.</p>
<p>Come over?</p>
<p>She didn't wait long.</p>
<p>Agatha's reply came like it had already been written:</p>
<p>I'm already on my way.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.n45m3k2b2q85">Chapter Thirty-Six: Let Me</h3>
<p>Later that night - Rio's apartment. 11:42 PM.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha let herself in with the key Rio had given her only once, wordlessly, on a day they were running late.
        </p>
<p>She hadn't used it until now.</p>
<p>The lights were low. A single lamp on in the corner. The air smelled faintly like wine and eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Rio was curled on the couch, barefoot, one of Agatha's old button-downs hanging loose on her body. No pants.
                No pretense.</p>
<p>She looked up slowly when Agatha entered.</p>
<p>Her eyes were heavy.</p>
<p>But not from sleep.</p>
<p>From everything else.</p>
<p>Agatha closed the door gently behind her. Shrugged off her coat.</p>
<p>She didn't speak.</p>
<p>Just waited.</p>
<p>Rio sat up. Legs folded beneath her. Watching her.</p>
<p>And then, voice low and hollow - not broken, just drained - </p>
<p>"I don't want to think anymore."</p>
<p>Agatha froze.</p>
<p>Rio stood, walked to her. Slowly. Barefoot on the wood floor. Her hands lifted to Agatha's waist, just
                resting there, light as breath.</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk," she whispered.</p>
<p>Her forehead pressed to Agatha's chest.</p>
<p>"I don't want to fight."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>And then, softer:</p>
<p>"I want you to tell me what to do."</p>
<p>Agatha's breath hitched.</p>
<p>She hadn't expected that.</p>
<p>Not from Rio.</p>
<p>Not here. Not like this.</p>
<p>She lifted her hands slowly. One to Rio's back. The other to her hair.
        </p>
<p>Held her.</p>
<p>And whispered against her hair:</p>
<p>"Strip."</p>
<p>Rio obeyed instantly.</p>
<p>Pulled the shirt over her head. Let it fall to the floor.</p>
<p>Naked now. Open.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice deepened. Steady. Controlled.</p>
<p>"Go to the bed. Lie on your back. Hands above your head. Eyes on me."</p>
<p>Rio moved like she'd been waiting for it.</p>
<p>No hesitation.</p>
<p>No walls.</p>
<p>Just obedience.</p>
<p>She lay down, just as instructed - legs parted, arms above, head turned slightly toward the door so she could
                watch Agatha undress.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't rush.</p>
<p>She unbuttoned her shirt with the same control she used in negotiations.</p>
<p>Each piece of clothing fell in quiet stages - until she stood bare, composed, ready.</p>
<p>She climbed onto the bed like a force.</p>
<p>Not violent.</p>
<p>Just inescapable.</p>
<p>She straddled Rio's hips. Leaned down. Kissed her slowly, thoroughly, like she had all night to remind her
                that she was wanted.</p>
<p>When she pulled back, she brushed Rio's hair from her forehead.</p>
<p>"Mine for the night," Agatha murmured. "Nothing else matters."</p>
<p>Rio's breath shook.</p>
<p>And she nodded.</p>
<p>"Yours."</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her again.</p>
<p>And began to show her what that meant.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.vqjpqe5tst7h">Chapter Thirty-Seven: No Thoughts, Only You</h3>
<p>Agatha kissed her like she had all the time in the world.<br/>No rush. No teasing.<br/>Just steady pressure and
                open heat - claiming every part of Rio's mouth like it belonged to her.</p>
<p>Because it did.</p>
<p>At least for tonight.</p>
<p>When she pulled back, she spoke low, firm:</p>
<p>"No more thinking."</p>
<p>Rio's breath trembled.</p>
<p>"Only feeling."</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>Agatha slid down her body, kissing every inch she could reach - her collarbone, her ribs, the soft give of
                her stomach.</p>
<p>She took her time. Let her hands map every inch like Rio was hers to learn.</p>
<p>And when she reached the apex of her thighs?</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>Looked up.</p>
<p>"You're not allowed to come," she said.</p>
<p>Rio whimpered.</p>
<p>"You'll come when I say."</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>Agatha smiled.</p>
<p>"Good girl."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>She slipped off the bed and crossed to the dresser drawer - one Rio had only half-explored before.</p>
<p>She pulled out the harness. Black leather. Clean lines.</p>
<p>The strap.</p>
<p>Rio's breath hitched audibly as Agatha stepped into it, tightened the buckles.</p>
<p>Purposeful. Graceful.</p>
<p>And so goddamn calm.</p>
<p>Like she'd been planning this all her life.</p>
<p>When she returned to the bed, she didn't say a word.</p>
<p>She simply knelt between Rio's legs and pressed her mouth back to her.</p>
<p>Licked and sucked and moaned into her cunt until Rio was trembling, writhing, biting her lip to keep from
                begging.</p>
<p>Agatha pulled back.</p>
<p>"Hands above your head."</p>
<p>Rio obeyed.</p>
<p>"Keep them there."</p>
<p>She lined herself up - cock thick and perfect, slick with lube and intention - and hovered at Rio's entrance.
        </p>
<p>Then paused.</p>
<p>Looked down at her.</p>
<p>And said, softly:</p>
<p>"This is mine, too."</p>
<p>Then she pushed in.</p>
<p>Slow.</p>
<p>Deep.</p>
<p>Full.</p>
<p>Rio gasped, arching into her, eyes wide and glassy.</p>
<p>Agatha groaned softly as she bottomed out, even though she couldn't feel it the way Rio did.</p>
<p>She could feel it through her.</p>
<p>Every twitch.</p>
<p>Every breathless moan.</p>
<p>Every broken "please."</p>
<p>She set a pace - steady, deep, devastating.</p>
<p>Her hands pinned Rio's wrists to the bed.</p>
<p>Her mouth hovered over her lips but didn't kiss her again.</p>
<p>"You take what I give you," she whispered.</p>
<p>And Rio did.</p>
<p>She took it all.</p>
<p>Over and over again.</p>
<p>She begged without shame. Sobbed her name. Moaned "thank you" like a prayer.</p>
<p>Agatha fucked her through it - slow and deep until Rio was shaking, then faster, rougher when her body begged
                for more.</p>
<p>When she saw Rio arch, breath hitching, on the edge - she stopped.</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>Rio whimpered, desperate.</p>
<p>Agatha held firm.</p>
<p>Slower now. Cruel in her care. A deep grind that kept her full, but didn't let her fall.</p>
<p>"Now."</p>
<p>And that was all it took.</p>
<p>Rio shattered.</p>
<p>Her body spasmed, clenched, legs wrapped around Agatha's waist as she cried out - wrecked and radiant and
                owned.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't stop.</p>
<p>She fucked her through it - one hand cradling the back of her head, the other gripping her hip tight enough
                to bruise.</p>
<p>Only when Rio went boneless beneath her - panting, trembling, whispering "please" without even knowing why -
                did she finally slow.</p>
<p>Withdraw.</p>
<p>Remove the harness.</p>
<p>Climb into her arms.</p>
<p>And hold her.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>No words.</p>
<p>Just breath.</p>
<p>Skin to skin.</p>
<p>Control turned to care.</p>
<p>And Rio?</p>
<p>Safe.</p>
<p>Sated.</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.bi3meayc5myy">Chapter Thirty-Eight: Care and Claiming</h3>
<p>Half an hour later - The bathroom. Steam. Warm light. Silence wrapped in safety.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha sat on the closed toilet lid, sleeves rolled, legs bare.</p>
<p>Rio was in the tub.</p>
<p>Her head resting on the rim. Eyes closed. Breathing slow.</p>
<p>She'd let Agatha undress her. Guide her into the bath. Say nothing while her trembling limbs obeyed.</p>
<p>Now her knees peeked through the water, skin flushed pink from the heat.</p>
<p>She looked like she could fall asleep mid-sigh.</p>
<p>Agatha dipped the washcloth again. Wringing it out slowly. Reverently.</p>
<p>Then leaned forward, sweeping it along Rio's arm.</p>
<p>"You're shaking less," she murmured.</p>
<p>Rio nodded. Barely.</p>
<p>"It's the water," she whispered.</p>
<p>"No," Agatha said gently. "It's me."</p>
<p>Another long breath.</p>
<p>Agatha moved to her shoulders. Her collarbone. The curve of her hip beneath the water.</p>
<p>Every stroke was slow. Intentional. Grounding.</p>
<p>Not sex.</p>
<p>Not performance.</p>
<p>Just care.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to do all this," Rio said, voice rasped raw with exhaustion.</p>
<p>Agatha's lips brushed her damp temple.</p>
<p>"You gave me everything," she said. "Let me give it back."</p>
<p>Rio opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Agatha was watching her - steady, quiet, present.</p>
<p>There was no pride in her face. No smugness. No gloating Dom claiming her prize.</p>
<p>Just warmth.</p>
<p>Just devotion.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to be a transaction," Rio said. "I don't want to give and give and wonder when you'll ask
                for the return."</p>
<p>Agatha set the cloth aside.</p>
<p>"You're not currency," she whispered. "You're not a performance. And you don't owe me anything."</p>
<p>Her fingers traced a gentle line down Rio's cheek.</p>
<p>"I want to care for you."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"I don't know how else to say it."</p>
<p>Rio sat forward.</p>
<p>Water sloshed.</p>
<p>She reached for her - wet fingers sliding around Agatha's wrist. Holding tight.</p>
<p>"You just did."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.n2hj50aysmry">Chapter Thirty-Nine: Back Under</h3>
<p>Agatha leaned in to kiss her forehead again - gentle, final, ready to help her out of the tub and into dry
                towels and a quiet bed.</p>
<p>But Rio caught her wrist.</p>
<p>"No," she whispered.</p>
<p>And then - her eyes half-lidded, her mouth still swollen, her voice low and hoarse:</p>
<p>"Get in."</p>
<p>Agatha blinked. "You need rest."</p>
<p>Rio's lips curved.</p>
<p>"Then come help me get it."</p>
<p>She tugged gently, and Agatha didn't fight.</p>
<p>Didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>She stood, unfastened her blouse, let it slide off.</p>
<p>Then the rest.</p>
<p>She stepped into the bath and sank down, straddling Rio's legs, water rising and sloshing over skin and
                porcelain.</p>
<p>The heat made her sigh.</p>
<p>Rio's arms wrapped around her immediately, pulling her close, their bare chests flush, hearts pressed
                together.</p>
<p>And then she kissed her.</p>
<p>God, did she kiss her.</p>
<p>Lazy. Deep. Open-mouthed and achingly sweet. Not frantic. Not chasing release.</p>
<p>Just want.</p>
<p>Just stay here with me.</p>
<p>Agatha melted into it.</p>
<p>She let Rio hold her. Let her tongue slide between her lips. Let her mouth trail down her jaw, her throat,
                her shoulder.</p>
<p>"You always give," Rio murmured against her skin.</p>
<p>"I want to."</p>
<p>"I know."<br/>A kiss to her collarbone.<br/>"I just want to give it back sometimes."</p>
<p>Agatha swallowed. Her hand cradled the back of Rio's neck. Fingers threading through wet hair.</p>
<p>"I'll let you," she said. "Eventually."</p>
<p>"Good," Rio whispered. "Because I'm going to wreck you."</p>
<p>Agatha smiled into her mouth.</p>
<p>"Looking forward to it."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.8mh0tbie7i5m">Chapter Forty: Stay</h3>
<p>Later - Rio's bed. Lights off. The city hushed beneath them.</p>
<p>They were wrapped in blankets and each other. Skin still damp. Limbs tangled.
        </p>
<p>Agatha had one arm beneath Rio's neck, the other across her waist. Like a fortress built just for her.</p>
<p>Rio's breath had slowed.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered closed.</p>
<p>And then, just before sleep claimed her - quiet, vulnerable, real - </p>
<p>"Stay."</p>
<p>Agatha didn't answer with words.</p>
<p>She just held her tighter.</p>
<p>And did.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.8z1lb6day3xj">Chapter Forty-One: The Reckoning</h3>
<p>Policy summit - Full boardroom. External reviewers present. High-ranking officials. Cameras on. It's
                showtime.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Rio had been quiet through most of the meeting.</p>
<p>Not withdrawn.</p>
<p>Just... simmering.</p>
<p>She'd been calm. Poised. Her hair pulled back. Black dress. No jewelry. No makeup beyond the lipstick Agatha
                had ruined two nights ago with her mouth.</p>
<p>And then it happened.</p>
<p>A man - older, gray at the temples, the kind of career Dominant who thinks "neutral tone' means condescension
                with a tie - leaned forward, shuffled his papers, and said:</p>
<p>"While I appreciate Dr. Vidal's... passion, I'm not sure we can take her critique of clause B seriously. It's
                not written to be emotionally interpreted. It's legal language."</p>
<p>The room quieted.</p>
<p>Dead quiet.</p>
<p>Even the intern holding a coffee tray froze.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't blink.</p>
<p>She didn't have to.</p>
<p>Because Rio sat forward - slowly. Carefully. Precisely.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>"Passion," she said.</p>
<p>Her voice was soft.<br/>Lethal.</p>
<p>"Let me be clear, Chairman Blackwell. What you're mistaking for passion is expertise."</p>
<p>He opened his mouth.</p>
<p>She cut him off.</p>
<p>"I hold two doctorates in social law and neurodesignation dynamics. I've authored three policy white papers,
                two of which were cited in your own subcommittee's recommendation report. You know - the one you didn't
                read until someone summarized it for you?"</p>
<p>Agatha's eyebrows arched. Her lips parted.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh this was going to be good.</p>
<p>Rio stood now.</p>
<p>Didn't raise her voice.</p>
<p>Didn't have to.</p>
<p>"You think because I'm a Submissive, I lead with emotion. But let me explain something to you, Chairman: this
                - " she held up the paper " - is not a passionate outburst. This is structural deconstruction at the
                molecular level. This is the clause that will be cited in court five years from now when a Submissive is
                fired for daring to correct a Dominant."</p>
<p>She took a step forward.</p>
<p>No fear. No apology.</p>
<p>"Your generation built this system on assumed compliance. Mine will rewrite it with informed consent."</p>
<p>Another step.</p>
<p>"You're not the future of designation policy."</p>
<p>She leaned across the table just enough to watch him flinch.</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>The silence that followed wasn't stunned.</p>
<p>It was annihilated.</p>
<p>No one spoke.</p>
<p>Not even Blackwell.</p>
<p>Not even Agatha.</p>
<p>But when Rio turned, collected her notes, and walked calmly out of the room?
        </p>
<p>Agatha stood.</p>
<p>Gathered her things.</p>
<p>And followed her.</p>

<h3 id="h.rehe8ibv9pqe">Outside - Agatha, breathless.</h3>
<p>She caught up halfway down the hall.</p>
<p>"Rio."</p>
<p>Rio turned, eyes still lit with adrenaline.</p>
<p>Agatha stared.</p>
<p>"You - " her voice cracked. "You just - holy shit."</p>
<p>Rio blinked.</p>
<p>"Too much?"</p>
<p>Agatha stepped closer.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Her hand found Rio's waist. Pressed her back against the wall.</p>
<p>"You were devastating. "</p>
<p>She kissed her.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>Fast.</p>
<p>Grateful.</p>
<p>Then pulled back just enough to breathe against her lips:</p>
<p>"I've never wanted to fuck someone across a conference table before."</p>
<p>Rio grinned. "We can add that to the list."</p>
<p>Agatha's eyes flashed.</p>
<p>"Make the list."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.q8fzyjuuanzf">Chapter Forty-Two: There She Is</h3>
<p>West Coast Press Conference - Capitol Steps - 2:47 PM</p>
<p>They called it historic.</p>
<p>"Unprecedented bipartisan support."<br/>"A radical restructuring of designation
                law."<br/>"The Vidal Protocol," someone dubbed it. On air. Live.</p>
<p>Agatha stood just behind her - off-camera but perfectly still - as Rio gave her final remarks.</p>
<p>She didn't stumble.</p>
<p>She didn't fidget.</p>
<p>She held the mic like a weapon and wielded her words like fire.</p>
<p>Agatha didn't blink once.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.tpap8dj6wnmw"><span class="c10 c13">Later - Rio's apartment. Door shut. Silence pressing in.</span></h3>
<p>Agatha leaned her hip against the kitchen counter, arms crossed.</p>
<p>Watching.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>Rio stood just inside the door, coat still on, heels in one hand.</p>
<p>Her knuckles were white.</p>
<p>Agatha could see it happening even before Rio could.</p>
<p>All that adrenaline. All that history. All that pressure to be brilliant, perfect, palatable - for them.</p>
<p>And then?</p>
<p>Suddenly?</p>
<p>She didn't have to be anymore.</p>
<p>Not tonight.</p>
<p>Not ever again.</p>
<p>The coat dropped.</p>
<p>Then the heels.</p>
<p>Rio crossed the floor slowly, like her body was no longer connected to time.
        </p>
<p>Her eyes never left Agatha's.</p>
<p>And then - without drama, without flourish, without a word - </p>
<p>She sank to her knees.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha exhaled so softly it was barely sound.</p>
<p>Rio's hands rested palm-up on her thighs, her chin tilted just enough to offer without begging.</p>
<p>Her eyes shimmered, but she didn't cry.</p>
<p>"Say something," she whispered.</p>
<p>Agatha's heels clicked softly as she stepped forward, letting Rio settle between her legs.</p>
<p>She took her time.<br/>One hand cupped Rio's cheek.<br/>The other slid through her hair, thumb brushing the
                crown of her head.</p>
<p>"You changed the world," she said quietly.</p>
<p>Rio's breath hitched.</p>
<p>Agatha smiled.</p>
<p>"You've been in control for so long, haven't you?"</p>
<p>Rio nodded once.</p>
<p>"Brilliant. Composed. Strong."</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>"And now you're ready to fall apart for someone who sees all of that and still wants more."</p>
<p>Rio's fingers flexed slightly against her own legs.</p>
<p>"I don't want to think tonight," she whispered.</p>
<p>Agatha's voice dropped.</p>
<p>"You won't."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then she leaned down - slow, precise - and kissed the corner of Rio's mouth.</p>
<p>Not cruel.</p>
<p>Not soft.</p>
<p>Claiming.</p>
<p>When she pulled back, Rio was panting.</p>
<p>"Stand up," Agatha murmured, her hand still wrapped in her hair. "Bedroom. Now."</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.1gveu6ki0jd5">Minutes Later - Bedroom</h3>
<p>Agatha pushed her gently onto the bed, climbed over her, and whispered into her mouth:</p>
<p>"There she is."</p>
<p>And then she ruined her.</p>
<p>Not with roughness.</p>
<p>But with deliberate reverence.</p>
<p>She stripped her slow.<br/>Worshipped every inch.<br/>Fingers. Tongue. Toys.</p>
<p>Each orgasm pulled from Rio like a reward she'd earned with every battle she ever fought.</p>
<p>And when Rio whimpered, too wrecked to speak, Agatha just kissed her wrist and whispered,</p>
<p>"Let go. I've got you."</p>
<p>And Rio did.</p>
<p>Fully.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<h3 id="h.hzl084cidfw">Chapter Forty-Three: For Me</h3>
<p>The next night - Lights low. Music soft. Agatha's bedroom, not Rio's.</p>
<p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, robe open, legs parted slightly.</p>
<p>Watching.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>Rio stood at the foot of the bed, loose tank top and sleep shorts clinging to damp skin from the bath.</p>
<p>She looked flushed.</p>
<p>Hopeful.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" she asked softly, fingers twitching at her sides.
        </p>
<p>Agatha tilted her head.</p>
<p>"You're not the only one with needs, cariño."</p>
<p>Rio stepped forward. Slowly.</p>
<p>Agatha's gaze dropped to her mouth. Her throat. Her hands. Back up.</p>
<p>"You've taken care of me so many times," Rio whispered. "But you never let me take care of you."</p>
<p>"I needed to know you were mine before I let you worship me."</p>
<p>Rio's breath caught.</p>
<p>And that word - worship - it landed like electricity.</p>
<p>"Are you ready to do that?"</p>
<p>Rio nodded.</p>
<p>Agatha smiled - something dark, delicious, but warm.</p>
<p>"Then on your knees."</p>
<p>Rio dropped instantly. No hesitation.</p>
<p>Agatha reached out - gentle, steady - and slid her fingers into Rio's hair.</p>
<p>"Take your time," she murmured. "I want everything you've been dying to give me."</p>
<p>And Rio?</p>
<p>She gave it.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Her mouth was reverent.<br/>Not tentative. Not frantic. Devoted.</p>
<p>She kissed the inside of Agatha's thighs until Agatha's hips twitched.<br/>She bit just enough to make her
                gasp.</p>
<p>And when her mouth finally found her ?</p>
<p>Agatha let her head fall back and moaned .</p>
<p>No control. No restraint.</p>
<p>Just need.</p>
<p>Just yes.</p>
<p>Rio didn't stop.</p>
<p>Didn't want to.</p>
<p>Not when Agatha started chanting her name.<br/>Not when fingers tangled in her curls.<br/>Not when thighs
                clamped tight around her shoulders.</p>
<p>And when Agatha finally came - hard - with a cry muffled into the back of her hand, Rio stayed there.</p>
<p>Holding her through it.</p>
<p>For her.</p>
<hr/>
<p></p>
<p>Agatha pulled her up after, wrapped her in arms and blankets and kisses.</p>
<p>She cradled her jaw and looked into those dark eyes and murmured:</p>
<p>"You are mine.<br/>And I am so goddamn lucky."</p>
<p>Rio smiled against her lips.</p>
<p>"Took you long enough to let me prove it."</p>
