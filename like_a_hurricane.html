<div class="userstuff">
<p>Tuesday morning, twelve days and roughly twelve hours to go, seven if she was lucky – not that she was counting – found Jen Barkley in the corner booth of the best coffee shop Pawnee, Indiana had to offer.</p><p> </p><p>They loved her here, thanks in large part to the fact that Jen knew how to get people to like her and wasn’t shy about using that knowledge to her advantage. The Daily Grind had the best coffee in town (which wasn’t saying too much; this was, after all, Pawnee<em>. Indiana, </em>in case you’d also missed that part) and Ellen, the owner, happened to have been in need of a few minor repairs around the place that had been accumulating for a while. It had been easy for Jen to cover them, and almost even easier to leverage Ellen into a spot where she’d accepted the help.</p><p> </p><p>Now Jen got decent coffee – often free, not that it really mattered – and Ellen was free to focus on hiring more people or rethinking the wallpaper or her dad’s home health service. Which was good, because Jen had been dangerously close to the point of losing her fucking mind if she’d had to go to JJ’s Diner <em>one more time</em>. Jesus Christ, the end of this nothingburger campaign could not come quickly enough.</p><p> </p><p>By 9:30, Jen had finished her daily skim of seven international newspapers and had fifteen minutes to spare before her meeting with Newport Senior. And therefore also fifteen minutes before resigning her olfactory senses to the saccharine smell that always stuck around in her nose for three hours, minimum, after a visit to the Sweetums offices. Jen took a preemptive breath of freedom and coffee and stretched in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>The morning rush had filtered out when Jen hadn’t been paying attention. Now it was down to Jen at her corner booth, a table of geriatric men who’d apparently all collectively forgotten their hearing aids, a wannabe tech bro in a zip up fleece vest and a plaid shirt waiting on somebody to show up for a meeting, a romantic reading a Jane Austen novel at a window table and waiting for someone to sweep her off her feet, and the woman whose order Ellen was taking at the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Something about her, though, made Jen sit up straighter and take a second look. What, exactly, she wasn’t sure – but Jen hadn’t honed her intuition like a weapon to be wrong when it lit up like her old Lite Brite.</p><p> </p><p>She was young, mid-twenties, maybe younger. Surprisingly put together in neatly fitting jeans, clean white Vans, and a dark blue hoodie. Average height. Attractive. Dark, shoulder length hair. A wedding ring on the hand tucking her card back into her wallet – God, how young did people get married and start popping out babies in this hellhole? And the thing that had probably piqued Jen’s interest in the first place – an understated charisma that Jen could just tell that this woman hadn’t bothered to fully learn her way around.</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman finished paying and turned around to go wait at the end of the counter and – uh oh. Busted. Oh, well. Jen hadn’t made a practice of backing down from twenty-somethings in hoodies to this point, and she wasn’t about to start now.</p><p> </p><p>But it seemed like Mystery Woman might like that, because she was coming over.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” she said. “Why are you staring at me?”</p><p> </p><p>To the point, no time wasted: a woman after Jen’s own heart. Jen thought about bullshitting her for the fun of almost certainly being called on it, but opted for the truth. “I don’t know,” she said. “You seemed interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman seemed skeptical about this reply. “You thought I seemed interesting… from me ordering coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>“What can I say,” Jen said. “I have an eye for these things. And I’m usually not wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you hitting on me?” Mystery Woman asked bluntly as she crossed her arms.</p><p> </p><p>Oh. <em>Interesting. </em>“I wasn’t trying to,” Jen replied. “Do you want me to?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m married,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t a no… per se. Jen let it go anyway, allowing herself a little preen and smile that, delightfully, made Mystery Woman scoff, but with a chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>“So do you usually have a hard time believing people when they tell you that you seem interesting?” Jen asked instead. “Because I’m getting the vibe that mystery and intrigue might kinda be your whole schtick.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I just find it hard to believe coming from you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Coming from <em>me?” </em>Jen said in exaggerated disbelief. “You don’t even know who I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I do,” Mystery Woman said. “You’re trying to sabotage Leslie’s campaign.”</p><p> </p><p>‘Leslie’, huh? “Last time I checked, I was <em>succeeding </em>in sabotaging Leslie’s campaign,” Jen corrected, because Leslie was currently eleven points down in the polls thanks to the <em>outstandingly</em> lackluster efforts of yours, truly. Let it never be said that Jennifer Barkley did subpar work, even at her most bored in a town that was making her more brain-dead by the second. “I guess that makes you one of her campaign staffers, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman shrugged. “I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Oooh, <em>definitely</em> part of her schtick. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re pretty much exactly the opposite of somebody I’d expect to see on Leslie’s team of earnest optimists.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well,” said Mystery Woman, “I guess all the spots for earnest optimists were already filled.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jokes, too,” Jen observed, daring to lean her chin on her palm. “Aren’t you just the full package.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s me, an apathetic pessimist with jokes.”</p><p> </p><p>The picture was starting to fill in a little. Smart, quick, loyal. Ready to fight. Apathy or pessimism aside, both of which Jen already doubted, she could see how Mystery Woman was just the kind of person Leslie Knope would want to take under her wing and foster like a baby bird.  </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm,” Jen said, drawing it out just to see if Mystery Woman would bristle. (Verdict: yes, but while keeping a pretty good lid on it.) “So what <em>is </em>an apathetic pessimistic doing on a contentious, losing campaign for a city council position in Pawnee, Indiana, then?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman only smiled like she couldn’t figure out why Jen was asking such a stupid question. “None of your business, really,” she said slowly. “Why do you care?”</p><p> </p><p>Great question. Opposition research, probably. But it was always bad form to actually say that to the opposition’s face. “Like I said,” Jen said, “you seemed interesting. And given that the amount of interesting things in this town is close to <em>zero – </em>“</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, so, why are <em>you </em>here?” Mystery Woman interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, money,” Jen answered honestly. “Lots of money. Really, an absurd amount.”</p><p> </p><p>Todd, the acne-challenged teenager manning the counter that morning, chose that minute to call “Satan’s Niece?”</p><p> </p><p>Mystery Woman tilted her head. “That’s me.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course it was.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, good luck with the campaign!” Jen called as Mystery Woman/Satan’s Niece deftly grabbed two trays of drinks and headed for the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Mystery Woman replied as she opened the door with her back. “Good luck with the sabotaging.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, thanks! I don’t need it!” Jen called cheerfully after her with a wave, and had no doubt that if both of her hands hadn’t been occupied by coffee trays, she would have received a casual middle fingered salute. Jen watched her get to her car and set down her trays on the roof.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Todd,” Jen called as he passed by to take out the trash. “That woman, the one who just left. What’s her name?”</p><p> </p><p>Inexplicably, Todd looked back at her with terror on his face. “I… can’t say,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>How deeply uninspiring. She hadn’t even given him a reason to be terrified of her. She had, in fact, been extremely nice to him every single day she’d come in during her interminable stay in Pawnee. “Can’t say, won’t say, what?” Jen pressed. “Come on, I’ve got fifty bucks for the tip jar.” That would probably buy him a decent amount of weed in this town… though she wouldn’t speculate about the quality.</p><p> </p><p>Todd looked tempted, but only for about half a second. “She’ll know,” he said. “I’m not taking the chance.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who, <em>Satan’s Niece?”</em> Jen demanded, incredulous. “What did she do to you?” The possibilities suddenly stretched entertainingly out in front of her. Was it something freaky? God, Jen hoped it was something freaky.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mind Todd. Her name’s April,” Ellen said as she passed by with armful of dishes for the dishwasher. “Nice girl. She works at City Hall, pops by a couple times a week and gets coffee for the office, usually in the afternoon.”</p><p> </p><p>Huh. ‘Satan’s Niece’ actually did seem more apropos than <em>April. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, Ellen, you’re a gem,” Jen said and glanced out the window again. Mystery Woman – April – had long since disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>Well. God willing, there wasn’t much longer to go in this campaign, and then Jen could go home and would never have to return to this town ever again, and Mystery Woman/Satan’s Niece/April would be just a blip in an otherwise mindnumbing six weeks of Jen’s life that would eventually grind to a merciful end.</p><p> </p><p>For now, there was a meeting she had to take to make that happen. Jen dropped the promised fifty in the tip jar on the way out, making sure to return Ellen’s smile and wave. Two weeks. Two weeks. That was all.</p>

<p>“April, great timing,” Ben said as she slid silently into his office about thirty seconds after Jen Barkley had swept out of it to catch a flight back to Columbus. “Look, <em>we </em>both know he’s a robot, but Jen wants to focus on Murray’s record in the home stretch, so we’re gonna – "</p><p> </p><p>"Who?”</p><p> </p><p>Ben was never one hundred percent on what was going on in April’s brain – actually, he’d been coming to terms with the possibility of any understanding of April he might ever have maxing out at about thirty, thirty-five percent – but right now he was operating at about a ten percent. He raised his eyebrows. “Jen.” Nothing. “Jen <em>Barkley. </em>She – she was literally just here, April. The woman who just left my office.”</p><p> </p><p>April’s expression didn’t register a change in understanding.</p><p> </p><p>“The person we came here to work for,” he tried again, to similar effect. “Do you at least remember her from Leslie’s campaign? She was on Perd Hapley’s show, like – a lot. Aaaaand you’re fucking with me, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>April shrugged, but there was a hint of a smirk that was starting to give her away. Ben was getting better at spotting it. He only had about a twenty percent error margin in either direction. He thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Ben. She was only everywhere all the time,” April said, which at least confirmed <em>that. </em>“I mean, I thought it was kind of weird that you wanted to work for somebody who was trying to destroy Leslie’s dream.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben raised his eyebrows. “But… <em>you</em> were fine with it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m not dating Leslie, so it’s definitely weirder for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben doubted he’d ever get straight answers out of April why she’d agreed to come with him to D.C. as an intern for a congressional campaign, but the questions he had were getting more complex all the time. “I guess that’s true,” he allowed. “I’ll guess I’ll try not to let that get in my head, thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>Oooookay. “So, now that we’re here and not in the middle of Leslie’s campaign, what do you think of Jen, anyway?” Ben asked while they were on the topic of Jen, genuinely curious. Ben himself had been a little apprehensive of taking this job and working with Jen, but like he’d been telling Leslie on their Skype calls, he was surprised by how much he was coming to actually like her. She was still a hurricane, but a hurricane Ben didn’t have to beat, and damn if it wasn't a thrill to get to work with it instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” April said, completely deadpan, no expression at all. “I’m obsessed with her.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben squinted at her. Was she fucking with him again? She did really, <em>really</em> like to fuck with him.</p><p> </p><p>“Look, April,” he said just to cover his bases, because that look in her eyes was making him a little nervous. “I know you know this, but just in case: Jen Barkley’s a very powerful and highly connected person. She’s not playing around, especially here, on her own turf.”</p><p> </p><p>April only rolled her eyes and turned away. “Yeah, yeah, I won’t fuck it up for you,” she said as she pushed the door open and left.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, April,” Ben called after her, but the door was already closing behind her. “We need to talk about – okay. Later.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p>                                                        </p><p>So it wasn’t like April went seeking Jennifer Barkley out herself. But it also wasn’t like April could help it if she walked into D.C. campaign headquarters at 10pm on a Friday while April was the only one there.</p><p> </p><p>Ben had gone home hours ago to have a Skype date with Leslie. April’s choices in things to do had been to either go out with the other interns to whatever dumb bar Smellis had picked and hope he didn’t follow her around with giant, terrified, turned-on puppy dog eyes, or molt in the darkness of her own bedroom and try not to listen to the boring lovesick conversation Ben and Leslie were having in the living room. Or whatever conversation they <em>weren’t </em>having, and nope, <em>no, </em>God, get her out, get her <em>out get her out – </em></p><p> </p><p>She’d had her own Skype date with Andy yesterday since Andy was supposed to be out tonight with Tom at the Snakehole. April had told him to go, no reason for them both to be miserable, even if it made her <em>more </em>miserable, and so April had decided to just lean all the way into the misery and stay at the office. In the dark. And the quiet. All the better to commune with the forces of darkness, so.</p><p> </p><p>Which was how the office was when a quiet <em>beep </em>and click of a lock disengaging signaled that someone had used their keycard to get into the office. April’s ears pricked despite herself. Maybe things were actually about to get interesting. Political espionage? A plot to embezzle campaign funds? Stowing a hostage from the principality of Lichtenstein over the weekend where nobody would notice? Agent Burt Macklin coming to rescue Janet Snakehole from an <em>incredibly </em>sad and boring Friday night?</p><p> </p><p>It was none of those things. The quick, confident sound of high heels across the floor resolved into the form of Jennifer Barkley striding directly to Ben’s dark office and poking her head inside. April’s interest shifted as she watched silently.</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, Ben,” Jennifer was saying to herself as she spun back around. “The <em>one time </em>you aren’t the workaholic I know you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Which was about the time she caught sight of April’s form slouched at her desk ten feet away, yelled, and staggered backward.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy <em>shit,” </em>Jennifer shouted, holding one hand against her chest. “Who the fuck are you and what the fuck are you doing here? Actually, before we do anything else,” she said, thinking better of it, and simply fumbled around on the wall until she found a light switch.</p><p> </p><p>April blinked at the onslaught of light and squinted, displeased.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. It’s you,” Jennifer said when she recognized April. “Wait, no, my original question stands. What the fuck <em>are</em> you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>April decided to stick to the simplest answer. “Uh, I work for Ben.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer’s look was skeptical, but she said, “Okay. You know, I don’t really care enough to ask follow up questions. Where is Ben, anyway? He’s not picking up his phone.”</p><p> </p><p>April sighed heavily, suddenly intensely sure that she’d made the right call to stay out of the apartment. “Skype date with Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Ugh,” Jennifer said, wrinkling her nose. “Wait, are you two Pawneeans living together?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup.”</p><p> </p><p>“Adorable,” Jennifer said flatly. “Well, whatever this is is pathetic. And I happen to be in<em> desperate </em>need of a drink. And seeing as how my D.C. campaign coordinator, who is also your roommate, has done the equivalent of putting a sock on his doorknob, come on. Let’s get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>April sat up. Was her night actually getting interesting? “Wait. Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I look like I’m joking?” Jennifer demanded with a double handed gesture up and down her body – one April’s eyes followed obediently. “I mean, you’ll have to remind me your name, because I absolutely forgot it five minutes after you told me the first time, but I <em>do </em>remember that you’re not boring. So are you coming or not? Don’t make ask again.”</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Because D.C. was a swamp heated by Satan and the fires of hell, and because Jennifer Barkley was apparently loaded, she called them an Uber Black to take them five blocks.</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t completely unused to feeling out of place next to ambitious, competent, intelligent, and professionally dressed women in politics, but Leslie had always been kind of an outlier. Leslie would probably say something that would make April want to crawl into a hole about it, like <em>I’ve had the great privilege of watching April grow into the beautiful and competent young woman she is today, </em>give or take a few adjectives and the degree to which April wanted the hole to close over her, but the truth was that she’d just kind of fallen into Leslie’s orbit when she’d been some dumb kid who hadn’t known or cared about anything.</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t that dumb kid anymore, which also meant she was extremely aware, actually, of the differences between her and Jennifer Barkley. April was still in her work clothes, sure, but Jennifer was on a whole other level with her power suit and pearls and heels and shiny perfect hair. And sure, April was a little afraid of her, but honestly she was also kind of into that. So sue her: April was married, not immune to the effects of hot, rich, powerful older women doing… whatever this was.</p><p> </p><p>“So what’s your angle,” Jen asked around a sip of her drink where they’d managed to get two seats at the bar. “You don’t really strike me as somebody who’s looking for an in in federal politics. Or who’s besties with somebody like Ben Wyatt. But I’ve been wrong before.”</p><p> </p><p>Gross. April hadn’t even meant to get this far in municipal politics. “No,” she deadpanned. “I actually hate everything about everyone, including Ben. And Congressman Murray.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer only looked bemused. “Okay,” she said, drawing out the word. “What exactly are you doing here, then? Ben’s not incompetent. It’s why I hired him. And he’s too endearingly anal retentive to do anything but surround himself with overachievers. Which is also why I hired him. So what does that make you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, his illegitimate daughter from a summer fling with a Puerto Rican witch. So a nepotism hire, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ben’s what, ten years older than you?” Jennifer said, unimpressed. “Max?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April conceded. “I’m his current hot young summer fling. Shh. Don’t tell Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try, if Ben weren’t grossly into Leslie. Try again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, <em>I’m </em>the Puerto Rican witch. I hexed him and it all went horribly, horribly wrong and now I’m here, help.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer only leaned an elbow on the bar and stared at April like she was the most fascinating thing she’d ever seen. “You are so fucking weird,” she said as she leaned her head into her hand. She was definitely at least a little drunk, but April wasn’t going to call her on it.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she said and drained the rest of her own drink.</p><p> </p><p>“But I’m curious, though – do you ever give real answers to these kinds of questions?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not really,” which was mostly the truth. “You’re a campaign manager – "</p><p> </p><p>“Political consultant,” Jennifer corrected with an unapologetic smile. “I don’t like to be boxed in.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you’re a <em>political consultant </em>in like, big time federal politics, and you’re out for drinks on a Friday night with me,” April said. “Puerto Rican witch-slash-lowly campaign intern. What does that make <em>you?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Bored,” Jennifer answered and sucked up more of her drink through her straw. “It wasn’t hard to guess that you were, too.”</p><p> </p><p>That was fair. This bar wasn’t exactly screaming “not boring”, though, but it was definitely a step up from where her night had been before Jennifer had shown up.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you really like it in D.C.?” April asked abruptly.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer gave her a sidelong glance. “You don’t,” she guessed.</p><p> </p><p>April missed Pawnee. “It’s okay, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer stared at her for a minute, halfway to a smile. Then she put down her drink and sat up. “I like being a power broker,” she said. “I like being the one who moves the chess pieces on the board, especially if a ton of those pieces are stupid – and they are,” Jennifer said, rolling her eyes. “God, they are <em>so </em>stupid.” But just as quickly, she got serious again, and said, “I like <em>winning. </em>And I usually do. That’s why everybody comes to me. I’m the best, and they know it.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what’s the point, if everybody’s stupid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, now you’re sounding like Leslie Knope,” Jennifer said with a smirk; and horrified, April realized she wasn’t wrong. Jennifer laughed. “It’s not a bad thing. I actually like Leslie’s idealism. It's cute. It’s just hard to hang on to. There have always been people moving other people behind the scenes, people tapping other people for other people’s ends. I’d just rather be one of the tappers than one of the tappees.” She trained a shrewd look on April. “You know, I've got a feeling you might, too. Generally speaking, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t even know me,” April said, but her thumbs smoothed compulsively through the condensation on her empty glass over and over and over.</p><p> </p><p>If Jennifer noticed – which she probably did – she didn’t say anything about it. April wasn’t sure if that was better or worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, well, you said you were bored,” April said to change the subject. “Are you still bored?”</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer’s eyebrow quirked and she turned to face April more fully. “You got something else in mind?”</p><p> </p><p>April took that as a yes and pulled out her phone, flicking to the Uber app. “Yes, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Jen,” Jen said with a lazy, growing smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, <em>Jen. </em>Finish your drink in…” April’s screen changed as a driver was confirmed. “Seven minutes. And get ready for gay karaoke.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“April? <em>April? </em>Come on, April, wake up and let me know you’re alive.”</p><p> </p><p>April opened one eye and groaned.</p><p> </p><p>“Signs of life!” Ben praised her. “Good morning, sleepyhead.”</p><p> </p><p>He was spending <em>way </em>too much time with Leslie. Because he wasn’t Leslie, April muttered at him to fuck off.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m actually about to,” he said, which meant that he was getting too used to April. “I got a message from Jen this morning that she wants to meet about something before she flies out. I’m not even gonna ask what happened to you last night, but I’ve put a large bowl next to you just in case you need it, and there’s water, Advil, and a granola bar on the table.”</p><p> </p><p>April made flopping motions in the direction of the generic Ikea coffee table without lifting her head. Leslie would have taken pity on her. Back when he’d had been her and Andy’s roommate in Pawnee, awkward and unsure Ben almost definitely would have. Today-Ben just laughed and said, “Yeah, you’re fine. I’ll be back this afternoon. Let me know if you want to have dinner in tonight. Whenever you actually want to think about food, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” April said around the fucking cotton balls in her mouth as his earlier words caught up with her. “Jen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Jen Barkley.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know who Jen Barkley is,” she groaned, irritated. For – God, <em>so </em>many reasons. Jen had texted Ben this morning? She’d gone shot for shot with April! Who the fuck even <em>was </em>she?  </p><p> </p><p>Ben laughed again, the motherfucker. “I’ll see you later. Feel better.”</p><p> </p><p>April flipped him off, but only in her head, because anything else was too much effort. She could always count on Ben to get the idea, though, and he laughed again as he shut and locked the door behind him. Whatever. She hoped his meeting sucked. She hoped Jen’s head was pounding and she was wearing dark sunglasses and that she was kind of a bitch to Ben about it.</p><p> </p><p>If there was a recording on her phone of Jen Barkley drunk off her ass and <em>still </em>managing to perform the shit out of “Since U Been Gone” to a crowd of also drunk-off-their-ass gays screaming with her, who really cared? April was going back home in less than a month, and then she’d probably never see her again. And if April pulled it up later when she finally reached for her phone (sixteen texts from Andy since three in the morning, two from Ben), still slouched down into the couch, nobody really needed to know that, either.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The Main Interior Building wasn’t exactly out of the way from Jen’s last meeting, and given that she had an hour’s worth of flux time before needing to cross the Mall again for the next one, it was a no brainer to make a pit stop and see if she could leverage the element of surprise against Leslie Knope while she was in town.</p><p> </p><p>Danny, the security guard, knew her well; and since Jen had had the foresight to make a call and get herself on the list of expected visitors before showing up, getting up to the floor where she’d been told Leslie had grabbed a temporary office was a breeze. From there, it was just a matter of lightly flirting with the floor’s receptionist-slash-gatekeeper for directions.</p><p> </p><p>The door was ajar. Jen rapped on it perfunctorily and pushed it open without waiting for a response. And inside it was –</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting you.”</p><p> </p><p>While it wasn’t Leslie Knope who looked up at one of the two desks crammed into this office, Jen was definitely in the right place. It had been what, three, four years since Ben Wyatt had had the temerity to turn down her job offer to fuck off back to Nowheresville, Flyover State and get married? Jen could be excused for not remembering this woman’s name. She also had a hazy recollection of a spectacularly alcohol-soaked night at some gay bar downtown, which probably also hadn’t helped with the memory thing. Hmm. She was pretty sure it was something that started with an “A”. But shorter. A little unexpected, maybe.</p><p> </p><p>“And here I am anyway,” Maybe-Ana said. “Hi, Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, everyone remembered Jen’s name. That wasn’t new. “Hi, yourself,” Jen returned. “So just wondering, since I <em>vaguely </em>recall you saying you didn’t actually want to be in government – should I congratulate you on your new position? What is it they told me? Executive director – “</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, shut up,” Maybe-Amy groaned. “It’s all been a horrible mistake. I shouldn’t be here. I’m catching a cab to the airport and moving to Transylvania to become a vampire.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm pretty sure it's Romania at this point, but yeah, sure, why not? Live the dream! But before you do, where’s Leslie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Meeting with the Secretary of the Interior. She’s supposed to be done in ten minutes, but he likes to talk, so who knows.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, great. Mind if I set up here?” Jen asked, already moving to the other desk – Leslie’s, presumably – and taking out her iPad.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, sure,” Maybe-Aubrey said, eyeing her skeptically. “But Leslie <em>will </em>kill you if you mess up those files, and I’m not taking the fall for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen almost laughed, incredulous, but was already halfway through replying to an email chain one of her partners had decided to drag her into. “Please. It takes a lot more than an irritated Leslie Knope to scare me. What is she gonna do, give me an insincere compliment?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” was all Not-Ashley said, making it clear that it wasn’t. With practiced ease, Jen ignored this. “Why do you wanna talk to Leslie, anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to convince her to run for Indiana state senate,” Jen said truthfully. “And it’s <em>so </em>much easier doing it here than subjecting myself to a trip to Pawnee and the assorted Knope-Wyatt spawn. Blegh. No, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence. Jen looked up to see Ava-Abby-Avril (Avril?) shrinking into her chair and back to concentrating on whatever she was working on. Ohhhh, fuck it. Now her curiosity was piqued. “No comments about any of that?” she prodded, just this side of caustic. “Or did I stumble into a sore subject?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s really not your business. Besides, isn’t this where you say you don’t really care?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, <em>ouch</em>. Jen didn’t bother pretending woundedness; she knew how to read a room. It was pretty obvious that it wasn’t the idea of Leslie making a bid for state senator that was bothering her. If Jen <em>did </em>get Leslie to run, and win – which she would, if Jen got her to run – it wasn’t hard to assume that she'd drag Maybe-Avril right along with her to Indianapolis, probably with a title change to chief of staff, and probably also insisting all the way that she hated it.</p><p> </p><p>Surreptitiously, Jen checked her left hand for a wedding ring: still there. Maybe-Avril had to be what, thirty, mid-thirties? Some quick deductions led Jen to a conclusion she felt was probably pretty damn close to the truth. In an extremely rare moment of indecision that she allowed herself only because the room’s only other occupant wasn’t looking, she bit her lip.</p><p> </p><p>But that was the moment that Leslie Knope's voice came from the open door: “Well, well, if it isn’t Jen Barkley."</p><p> </p><p>Jen had to hand it to her, she looked pretty fantastic for somebody who had just grown and squeezed three human beings out of her body. “Glad to see you’ve made yourself comfortable,” Leslie continued with a pointed smile. Jen raised her eyebrows and glanced at Maybe-Avril, who rolled her eyes. “What brings you to the Department of the Interior?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it's funny you should ask, Leslie,” Jen said. “A little bird told me you were in town.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Leslie said, apparently perplexed. “Well, it’s nice of you to drop in and say hi, Jen, but I don’t think – "</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no,” Jen cut her off before she could get any ideas. “This isn’t a social visit.”</p><p> </p><p>Maybe-Avril stood up and shut her laptop. “I’m gonna give you two the office,” she said, but to Leslie. “Do you want coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why, thank you, April – " <em>April, </em>yes, that was it. “ – you know me so well. Jen, do you – "</p><p> </p><p>But Jen had taken the break to go back to her phone. “Oh, I won’t be staying long,” she clarified, already replying to an email.</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t ask again. “Okay, then, bye,” she said, and then disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that was a little ominous,” Leslie observed, still with that smile as she turned back to face Jen. “So I’m guessing I might not like the answer, but - what can I do for you?"</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Leslie hadn’t gone for it – and eh, it had been a longshot. It had been all <em>I’m flattered, Jen, but I just had triplets, Jen </em>and <em>I just got my dream job, Jen, </em>and <em>I can’t move to Indianapolis right now, Jen!</em></p><p> </p><p>And that was fine. Really. The truth was that Jen actually had her eye on a Knope campaign in four years’ time. Leslie would go home and mention it to Ben, and Ben would work on talking her into it when their life-ruiners times three were old enough to be ruining their lives a little less, and Jen would be primed to hit go on the campaign exactly when she’d planned to do so.</p><p> </p><p>But speaking of life-ruiners and feelings about them –</p><p> </p><p>April was approaching the entrance to the Main Interior Building with a tray holding two coffees to go; and when she spotted Jen leaning against the façade, she briefly stopped and tilted her head. Jen put away her phone. <em>Yeah, you, </em>she didn’t have to say.</p><p> </p><p>April met her halfway. “So? Did you get what you wanted?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did,” Jen confirmed. “But don’t tell Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Which means…”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, she’s not gonna be asking you to move to Indianapolis with her.” Not anytime soon, anyway. She glanced at the tray of coffees, which April moved to hold out of her reach with a look. Jen raised her hands in a gratuitous display of innocence, which did the trick: April’s lips quirked at the corners, just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she said, “so you’re still hanging around, why?”</p><p> </p><p>Showtime. Jen grew serious. “Because I’m taking a stab in the dark about things that aren’t my business,” she said bluntly. April's body language shifted immediately into something less comfortable and she looked away, which meant that Jen, as usual, was dead on. “Listen,” she persisted. “Ordinarily, I wouldn’t. But I’m just saying – I’m child-free and <em>ecstatic. </em>If you ever need some of that kind of energy to balance out any other energy you might be getting…”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” April cut her off tightly. “No offense, but I really don’t want to talk about this.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her hands again, this time more sincerely. “Okay,” she said. “But if that changes – " she took a second to procure her business card from the pocket of her blazer – “Leslie mentioned you weren’t leaving until tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>April took it tentatively with her free hand. It was clear when she spotted the number Jen had handwritten at the bottom. “Why do you care?” she asked as she looked up.</p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, put on a smile, and shifted her bag over her shoulder in preparation to leave. Honestly, she was pretty much at her limit on this kind of thing for the hour, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Call me,” she said as she started walking away. “Or don’t! I’m good either way.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was around seven that night that Jen got a text from an unknown number. She flicked it open without thinking about it to discover a video, no text.</p><p> </p><p>That did make her pause. She looked more closely at the thumbnail: a crowd of people in the foreground, some kind of stage in the background, garish lights everywhere. The play button displayed right over the figure who was evidently performing on it. She narrowed her eyes, but another text came through from the same number:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hey. I never had a number to send this to a few years back. Thought you should have it too.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Huh. Jen clicked play, and was immediately assaulted by the tinny sound of a screaming crowd and… oh, <em>fuck, </em>was this karaoke? Who the hell was butchering this song?</p><p> </p><p>Oh. Oh no. Jen looked closer. Well, at least she looked damn good doing it.</p><p> </p><p>A drunk, tinny voice identifiable as April’s was screaming over the speaker now, too, mercifully overwhelming any recording of past-Jen’s attempt at the bridge. A disbelieving smirk twisted at current-Jen's lips. April had just had this hanging out on her phone for the past three years? </p><p> </p><p><em>Yes, thank you, I do love watching myself perform while spectacularly drunk, </em>she typed back. <em>Was that all? </em></p><p> </p><p>Five minutes went by, before:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>No. I could actually use some of that child-free ecstatic energy if you’re still offering.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen deliberated a minute, then sent her address. <em>I have wine. And the hard stuff.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Three more minutes. Then, <em>On my way. Eta 20 min</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>April looked even more exhausted when Jen opened the door than she had six hours ago.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Jen said. “Come on in. What’s your poison? You look like you need it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, wine’s fine,” April said, looking around. “Great place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, for the $100k renovation I just did, it’d better be. Come on, through here.”</p><p> </p><p>April immediately abandoned her wine for weed as soon as Jen offered it as a possibility – Jen didn’t blame her – and they retreated to Jen’s patio, passing the joint between them under the light pollution and a just-visible half moon. It was also forty-seven fucking degrees and too cold for this shit, but Jen refused to smoke indoors. She dragged two fleece blankets outside and threw one of them at April. April muttered a ‘<em>thank god’ </em>under her breath, before she another drag off the joint and passed it back off to Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn, that’s good shit,” she said, already looking more relaxed. “Don’t know why I’m surprised.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled and let the first effects start to curl through her own bloodstream. “Are you actually?” she asked, curious, and cracked her neck before settling back against the sectional, feet propped up on the ottoman.</p><p> </p><p>April laughed lazily from where she was tucked into the corner and held out a demanding hand. “I guess not. Pass it back.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen did so without comment, but let her gaze linger during the hand off. There was something compelling about her, there always had been; that much Jen would probably always remember about her just because of the way it always reasserted itself in Jen's brain and caught there. Chaotic. Unexpected, definitely, and still a little unrefined in a way that made Jen itch to grab hold just for the sake of doing so. Whatever it was had only intensified in the gap of the last few years, aging like the wine they'd both left back on Jen's polished granite kitchen island.</p><p> </p><p>In profile, highlighted by shadow, April was striking, almost absurdly beautiful. Her smooth, dark hair was falling out of its clip and haphazardly into her face, and combined with the purse of her lips around the joint, around the smoke that came after – well, Jen wasn’t usually one to mince words when a woman was hot.</p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she said, which got April to look over at her, “so let me guess. You’re surrounded by chaotic little baby Knope-Wyatts and Ben and Leslie doped up on the ‘parenting is so incredible’ train, despite the literal mountains of diapers they’re going through and the singular hour of sleep per night that they’re getting, if they’re lucky, and you’re feeling pressure to produce offspring of your own. Is that an accurate summary of the situation?”</p><p> </p><p>April paused, holding smoke in her lungs. Wordlessly, she passed the joint.</p><p> </p><p>“For a stab in the dark, it’s not terrible,” she admitted once Jen’s mouth was preoccupied. Jen looked at her once she’d exhaled in the opposite direction, only to find April’s eyes resting on her, dark, still, unknowable. </p><p> </p><p>It only took a little encouragement to get April to fill in the particulars. She’d been young when she’d gotten married. Her husband was older than her, and while he was kind and sweet and funny and loved his wife, was also – Jen was reading between the lines, here – not the brightest bulb in the box. They'd never talked about kids before now because they hadn’t really needed or wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>“It wasn’t a whole thing until Ben and Leslie had the triplets," April said, staring at her lap. "But Andy <em>loves </em>kids, and he’d be a great dad, and it would make him so happy…”</p><p> </p><p>“But not you.” Jen scrutinized her face through the darkness - what she could see of it, anyway. “Or there’s more, isn’t there. You said he was like a big kid. Did you mean that in the present tense?”</p><p> </p><p>April burrowed more deeply into the corner, under the blanket. “I feel like a horrible person,” she said, which answered <em>that </em>question.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t,” Jen advised her sharply. “Big kids don't raise actual kids. Sure, he likes wrangling the Knope-Wyatt terrors, probably with supervision, if I had to guess from what you’re saying, but at the end of the day, he’s not actually responsible for them. Of course you hate the idea of having to parent your husband and actual kids simultaneously. Especially when your husband is a <em>forty-five year old man.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“He’s forty-two,” April mumbled, which made Jen roll her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever. I’m just gonna go ahead and say this now. You’re not crazy. But you know what <em>would</em> be crazy? Having kids anyway! Like, yes, I’m sure your husband’s great, he loves you, he’d love his kids, <em>sure</em>. But for the record, if you’re keeping one: you don’t owe kids to anybody. Not your husband, and not Leslie Knope.”</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t respond to this, and Jen briefly thought that she’d stepped over some line bringing Leslie into it, which was really just a hunch. But no: April was only looking at her, eyes dark and inscrutable and reflecting Jen’s words back at herself.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jen snapped, tensing.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t seem to bother April. “Why did you ask me out for drinks that night?” she asked. <em>Why did you invite me here tonight? </em>Tacit, the words hung suspended in the air between them while Jen stared, caught, and April stared right back. </p><p> </p><p>They kept ending up here, didn't they? <em>Why are you here? Why did you ask me? Why did you come? </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Why do you care? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>One beat, two. Jen laughed, brassy and unapologetic, plucked the joint out of April’s fingers and put it to her own mouth. “You’re high,” she observed while smoke escaped around the words.</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t ask again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Their flight left out of Dulles at 11:30 the next morning, which Jen knew, again, because Leslie had managed to volunteer the information during their brief conversation the day before. Jen didn’t hear from either of them before then, not that she’d really expected to. Still, she paused when a notification popped from an unsaved number around 5:30.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I don’t think I said it last night so - thank you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated with her thumbs over the keyboard. <em>You’re welcome, </em>she replied cautiously. <em>Good luck, either way. </em></p><p> </p><p>There was no response. Jen, having trained it out of herself early, knew how to not take it personally. But she did take a second to save the number as a new contact, just in case.</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The first thing you learned when you worked for a nonprofit was the importance of convincing rich people to give you their money.</p><p> </p><p>Logically, April had known that the whole "no profit" thing combined with the "no government budget" thing meant that her new job was going to be fundraising-adjacent, but she really hadn't thought that she'd find herself at three separate events within the space of six months to be a part of Team "Get Mostly Rich Old White Dudes to Hand Over Their Money". Fortunately, though, it was a team spirit that she could really get behind.</p><p> </p><p>Also fortunately, April could really do events at this point. She had a whole wardrobe of fancy or fancy-adjacent event-wear at this point, leftover from years of first small government functions and award ceremonies and then the soul-crushing political parties here in Washington that Leslie had dragged her to once or twice a year after she'd been enough of a sucker to allow herself to be dragged into a job with a title that included not only <em>Executive Director,</em> but also, worse,<em> of Regional Affairs. </em></p><p> </p><p>This particular event was in a fancy old hotel not far from the Hill, so while it wasn't a "political event", it turned out that April played herself when it came to her decision to move to D.C. Alyssa passed by with a smile and one of the signature cocktails their bar stations were serving tonight: a (ugh) "Sweater Weather". They were delicious, which April knew because she'd intimidated some 25-year-old working one of the bar stations into making her one of them four hours ago during event setup. She'd been sipping on mocktails since then, but if the universe was offering her another one now? She wasn't about to turn it down.</p><p> </p><p>"Hanging in there?" she murmured as she passed April the drink, which April gratefully accepted and took an immediate sip of.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, since you're bringing me alcohol..."</p><p> </p><p>Alyssa laughed. "The name sucks, but the drink slaps, regrettably."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm too far into this event to care," April said with a smile that hopefully looked just the right amount of "deranged witch who can eat your soul" to keep people from approaching her without being too alarmed to do the money handing over thing.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Alyssa sighed. "It's just the holiday season. Thanksgiving'll hit in two weeks and we'll be home free. Hey, any Christmas plans? Are you going back to Indiana?"</p><p> </p><p>"Uhhh," April said intelligently, mostly because the crowd in front of them had parted enough to give her a clear view of someone she hadn't seen in a year and a half.</p><p> </p><p>Alyssa followed her gaze and frowned. "Do you know her? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, given your background."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, we've met a few times," April said. So far, so true. "She was technically my boss at one point, I guess. And once she ran a campaign against my other old boss. So. You know. I've seen her around." Done drunk gay karaoke with her. Shared a joint with her. Had the entire direction of her life changed because of her. Whatever. </p><p> </p><p>Alyssa didn't comment, but she did make a face that let April know that some of what she hadn't said had probably come through anyway. "Okay," she said, calmly, as if she totally hadn't. "Well, it might be nice to catch up?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm. Yeah. Maybe," April said, noncommittal, and Alyssa wandered away again with a touch to her elbow.</p><p> </p><p>April had wondered a few times if she’d ever run into Jen Barkley again now that she’d moved to D.C., despite the fact that April had pretty much taken herself out of the circles that Jen ran in. Sure, she still had her phone number, but it had felt wrong to reach out. Like, what a weird situation. What would she even say? <em>Hey, remember we got super high when you invited me over and gave me your expensive, fancy weed and you made me think, like really think, about not having kids, actually, and then I went home and thought about it some more and got divorced, so thanks for that? </em></p><p> </p><p>Yeah. April had held off on that one.</p><p> </p><p>Getting divorced sucked. Seriously, just an all around bummer of the highest magnitude. At some point, it had become obvious to April that there was no way around it – that it was either get them both out now or be slowly destroyed by it. It had also been obvious that she’d have to be the one to push it through, the same way she’d pushed Andy for them to get together in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>Andy didn’t get it. Of course he didn’t. He begged, he’d said things he didn’t mean about kids not being <em>that </em>important to him, that what he wanted didn’t matter, that it <em>wouldn’t</em> matter, that he’d keep it under wraps, he’d get over it, he loved her, he loved her so much, he would do literally anything, just please come home, honey, please?</p><p> </p><p>In her sister’s shitty apartment, April had pulled the pillow over her head and screamed. Natalie, proving that sisters didn’t completely suck sometimes, had slid into bed behind her and held her without saying anything.</p><p> </p><p>Donna… kind of got it? Or at least she’d taken her out for dinner and made it clear she supported April and that she was welcome over at her and Joe’s any time. So did Tom, but Tom also still mostly didn’t know how to say anything and mean it unless Lucy was standing right behind him. She honestly didn’t know if Ron got it, really, but he’d taken her out to his secret cabin that somehow Diane still didn’t know about and hung out in mostly silence with her for two days. Ben pretended he got it, and kept texting her to ask how she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie, of course, didn’t get it at all, and kept leaving April voicemails that trailed off into some variation of <em>but maybe if you and Andy just talked </em>that April immediately deleted before she had a panic attack.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, April had moved to D.C. on her own. Ben had been waiting at her new place when April pulled up half an hour ahead of the movers, and then, because of course Ben had brought it, she’d been enough of a loser to play his stupid game with the stupid cones with him for <em>multiple</em> hours, surrounded by boxes and bare white walls clawing and shrieking at her that she’d made all the wrong moves. Neither of them had acknowledged the boxes he’d left on her kitchen counter that contained: a large potted Venus Fly Trap (which, yeah, okay; it was cool), basic groceries, a $100 gift card for GrubHub, a framed photo of the old Parks and Rec crew, another one of just her and Leslie, and a twenty-three-page handwritten letter that April still hadn’t been able to bring herself to read.</p><p> </p><p>And after all that, it had taken until last month for the divorce papers to come in the mail. April had signed them without reading them, put them back in the envelope, then drunk an entire bottle of wine.</p><p> </p><p>So, yeah – no. April hadn’t reached out to Jen Barkley.</p><p> </p><p>But all that was behind her. And today, right now, April wasn’t thinking about any of it, because Jen had finally clocked that someone was looking at her and had shifted her body to look back. Her head tilted; a smirk hinted at her mouth. April stared until one of Jen’s eyebrows raised in what was obviously an invitation.</p><p> </p><p>And, yeah. Okay. Yeah.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she said after she’d taken it, slowing to a stop a step or two away from her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Jen parroted back, looking her up and down with a casually appraising look. “I’d been wondering how you were doing. What brings you to this overblown dog and pony show? I haven’t seen Leslie around; wouldn’t have thought I’d see Parks people at this one. Unless I got my wires crossed. Unlikely; it’s <em>me</em>. But just between you and me, this is like, the third one of these things I’ve been to this week, so.”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuated this by taking a long sip of the wine she was holding and then setting down the empty glass on a passing server’s tray. Then she fixed her gaze back on April, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, uh, I don’t think she’s here,” April said, starting with the Leslie question. She hoped not, anyway. “I don’t work for her, anymore – I’m with the Foundation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really.” Jen’s gaze was as piercing as it ever was. “Should I say congratulations?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure. I mean, yeah. Congratulate me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations,” Jen said, voice dry. “We’re not talking about the not working for Leslie thing, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Well, if she was giving April the option. “Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>In a motion so quick April might have missed it if she wasn’t watching Jen so closely, Jen’s eyes flicked down to her left hand. Her bare left hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Jen agreed, and in a move April should have seen coming, breezed right past it. “Then how’s about I buy you a drink at this open bar?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Once – okay, twice. Fine, <em>three times, </em>fuck – in the last few months, April had woken up conflicted and horny from a dream where Jennifer Barkley was shotgunning smoke into her mouth while April deliberately pressed her hips down into her lap.</p><p> </p><p>And no, it hadn’t actually happened. But the higher April had gotten out there on Jen’s freezing patio all those months ago, the more fixated she’d gotten on the way the smoke had escaped Jen’s lips. Even curled up under that insanely soft fleece blanket, she’d looked powerful. Really fucking powerful. Maybe it was actually the blanket that had heightened the contrast between professional Jen the Shark and domestic Jen at Home. All April knew was that it had triggered her basest instincts to climb over her without a word, seal their mouths together, and see if she’d exhale with April’s commanding hands holding her neck in place.</p><p> </p><p>April really had no idea why somebody like Jen Barkley was interested in her. But here they were. Again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, so, I’m not married anymore,” April blurted out before she could second guess herself.</p><p> </p><p>Next to her, Jen paused. “Okay,” she said, slowly. “Just to be crystal clear – was that an invitation?”</p><p> </p><p>April took a minute to make sure on a deep breath, then nodded. “Yeah. I think so,” she said, and then plowed right into, “So do you wanna make out with me, or what?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen ducked her head to hide the way she was biting her smile. Was that calculated to make April want to do it for her? Because it was working. “Yeah,” Jen said, an easy, low admission, “I do,” and then curled her hand firmly around April’s wrist. One finger teased over the thin skin over April’s veins, and she laughed when April jumped. <em>Do it again, </em>she didn’t demand, <em>dig your nails in, make me bleed, let me see it.</em></p><p> </p><p>If anybody noticed Jen leading her to the bathrooms by the wrist, April couldn’t tell. The bathrooms themselves were ridiculously opulent, single stall with a sink and a closed door situations, and Jen looked furtively around before ducking them inside one of them. April instinctively hopped up on the marble counter next to the sink while Jen locked the door, which was the right move: Jen stepped immediately between her legs and crowded her space. Fuck. April’s stomach dipped. Why was this already so hot?</p><p> </p><p>“This okay?” Jen asked as she cupped her cheek, eyes already fixed on April’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>Yes. <em>Obviously</em>. April didn’t want to think about it, okay. She didn’t want to <em>think</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” she said, buzzing and high on adrenaline and want, and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen immediately took whatever control April might have had in making the first move, her tongue sweeping bold and <em>God, </em>fucking talented, into April’s mouth. April was bisexual, but it had been a long time since she’d made out with a girl or gotten a hand up one’s shirt, and she’d been young and stupid and mostly drunk whenever that actually had happened.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t drunk now. Honestly, she couldn’t remember feeling this overstimulated from any kiss before while she was sober. Jen’s tongue was doing things to her mouth that made her ears ring with static and her fingers buzz. Distantly, April was aware that her hair was being pulled, and the edge of pain made the way Jen was starting to suck on her tongue – <em>fuck </em>– <em>so </em>fucking good. Maybe it was just that it was different; maybe it was that this was somehow the first thing that had felt solid since April left Pawnee. Either way, April was making noises she didn’t think she’d ever made before, from a <em>kiss, </em>which made Jen laugh and do it again, do it more.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Fuck,” </em>April said emphatically when they broke apart, gasping for air. She felt like a wreck. She <em>was </em>a wreck. She’d wrapped her legs around Jen’s waist somewhere in the middle of it, and her dress was pushed up to her waist. More electric still was the way the rough fabric of Jen’s no doubt ridiculously expensive sheath dress felt against her inner thighs, teasing against her naked cunt.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you doing?” Jen said on a giggle. A <em>giggle. </em>Fuck, <em>fuck. </em>Jen’s palm slid up and down the outside of April’s left thigh where it had planted itself, firm and possessive, when April had been focused on other things.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d let you fuck me right here if you wanted to,” April said honestly and let her head fall back against the mirror with a thud. “Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“Now <em>that’s </em>an invitation,” Jen said on another laugh, voice low enough that it made April shiver against her. Jen was obviously interested in taking her up on it: her hand stuttered on April’s thigh, she was biting her lower lip while staring at April’s, again, and her other hand had tightened unconsciously against the small of April’s back and brought her hips tighter between April’s legs. April wasn’t proud of the whimper she made.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April said once she’d gotten some steadiness back in her voice. “Then fuck me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Jen said, eyes darkening, fingers already moving to dip between their bodies, between April’s spread legs. “Right here, right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re a fucking coward,” April demanded, grabbing her own handful of Jen’s hair. “Fucking <em>fuck </em>me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I will,” Jen promised, voice rough with the truth of it, and April could feel it in the way her fingers were already splitting the lips of her cunt. “You’re already wet. No underwear – were you planning this?” And no, but that <em>really didn’t fucking matter </em>when her fingers slipped right inside April while her magical thumb got to work on and around April’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>Nobody had ever accused April of being quiet during sex, but her one concession to public sex in a place that might get her fired was that she usually tried to keep her voice down.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, and her voice was commanding enough that April wrenched her eyes open. “Fuck that. Let me hear you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Congress,” April managed while Jen’s slender, knowing fingers hooked and fuck, fuck, <em>fuck, </em>twisted and dragged inside her, and then did it again. Shit, <em>how </em>was she doing that? “Or whatever.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you just trust me to handle it, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>freak,” </em>April moaned, delighted. “You fucking megalomaniac.”</p><p> </p><p>“Never had complaints before,” Jen said with a breathy note to her voice that just spun April higher. “Come on, baby, give it to me.”</p><p> </p><p>April wanted Jen on her knees with her face covered in April’s come. She wanted Jen’s entire hand inside of her. She wanted to slap the smug smirk off her face and make her beg or come or both until she cried. She never, ever wanted Jen to stop what she was doing right now between her legs, with an entire ballroom of pretentious politicians and rich people listening to how insanely good it felt to have Jennifer Barkley fingering her in this stupid, fancy bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>When April came, it was with a moan that echoed obscenely off the marble, with Jen biting down on April’s lower lip, with two handfuls of Jen’s hair in April’s fists; and when it was over, she slouched panting and boneless against the mirror. Jen followed her, kissing her even more messily than during the makeout session that had gotten them here, and April felt hot, overwhelmed, lipstick smeared across her face and two seconds away from coming again.</p><p> </p><p>Until Jen straightened up and fixed her clothes and dug around in her abandoned purse for tissues and makeup, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that was fun,” she said, bright and apparently totally sincere as she touched up her lipstick in the mirror next to April, and then gave her a sideways glance. “You good?”</p><p> </p><p>April was incredible, but a little confused. “Yeah,” she said while her brain tried to start up again. “Wait, are <em>you?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed and capped her lipstick, apparently satisfied with what she saw in the mirror, and dropped it back in her bag. “Are you kidding? This’ll power me through the next two hours. But at the end of those two hours I wouldn’t say no if you wanted to come back to my place. Here, you’ve got some – "</p><p> </p><p>April took the tissues Jen was offering her, stared at them blankly, and then laughed. This was insane, wasn't it? She felt insane. She felt <em>amazing.</em> </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, waving away Jen’s impatient concern again while she attacked the mess around her mouth. “Can I borrow – "</p><p> </p><p>Jen was already thrusting a comb and a different tube of lipstick at her. “This should get you out the door, if you wait another few minutes. Probably not a good idea to stick around, though.”</p><p> </p><p>“But it is for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Oh, you mean because of the – " Jen gestured vaguely in a way that April guessed was supposed to mean <em>the way you moaned loud enough that there should be cops outside waiting to arrest us on public indecency. </em>“No,” she said on a cackle. “Oh, no. These things are almost completely soundproof. The CIA used to have meetings in here. I mean, who did they think they were kidding, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, really?” April said, intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>“That or they were doing what we were just doing. To be fair, it was probably some of both. But with penises, though, mostly. Central Intelligence has historically hated to see a lady winning. Or, you know. <em>Hear </em>a lady winning.” She finished up with her makeup, checked her dress – which was fine again, somehow – and was clearly satisfied with what she saw. She turned to April, who had managed to sit up and tug her own dress back down her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“So I’ll see you later?” Jen said expectantly.</p><p> </p><p>April thought about it - but not for long.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” April said. “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to come down in person,” Ben had said over the phone. “I’m pretty sure we can handle this at local campaign HQ and recap with you virtually afterwards on strategy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ben!” Jen said, outraged. “Just what kind of campaign manager do you think I am?”</p><p> </p><p>“One who probably has bigger and better things to do and is almost certainly handling this one as a favor?”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, he wasn’t exactly wrong about that one. It was true that Jen hadn’t wanted anybody but herself handling this campaign for her own reasons. One of those reasons being that she’d done the math and run the numbers and was absolutely playing the long game for a presidential campaign in the next eighteen to twenty-two years.</p><p> </p><p>Not that either of the Knope-Wyatts needed to be let in on that little secret just yet. She could get Ben there. She was pretty sure she could get Leslie there, too. Although it would be a bigger sell with the whole woman thing and the American public’s demonstrated aversion to the idea of POTUS having a uterus. But she wasn’t a goddamn magician – one of them had to actually land themselves an entry level spot on the big boys and girls’ chessboard first.</p><p> </p><p>This was how Jen found herself in Pawnee – Indiana, in case there was any doubt – on a Thursday night after a town hall in the race that was just starting to heat up for Indiana’s 9<sup>th</sup> congressional district. It had, in fact, been a pretty great early boost for Team Wyatt 2018. Jen expected that her minion’s minions would be reporting back very nice poll numbers and favorable news coverage over the coming weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Jen thought with satisfaction as the backmost lights in the auditorium were cut with a <em>thud. </em>This was all shaping up according to plan.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that went well,” she told Ben as he gathered the last of his things after seeing off the rest of his staffers with a congenial wave. “Great job.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Ben said, clearly pleased. “And thanks again for coming all the way out. I know we haven’t even started really ramping up yet, and this was just a local event.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s my job, Ben,” Jen reminded him. “Gotta start this campaign out strong. And I mean, your history when dealing with press has historically not been ideal, let’s say, so – “</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, what do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her eyebrows. “I looked you up, Ben, before we met,” she explained slowly. “You had just been trying to promote some little hay and horses shindig here in Pawnee?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Harvest Festival,” Ben corrected.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” said Jen. “You’d done a few spots on local radio and television?” She trailed off and let her face convey the sentiment of <em>yikes.</em></p><p> </p><p>Ben looked mortified, which meant he knew exactly and specifically what she was talking about. “No. You – I mean. <em>How – ?”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, everyone’s seen it, Ben,” Jen dismissed briskly. “Did you really think you could say something like <em>‘Who hasn’t had gay thoughts?’</em> on a talk show and the internet wouldn’t put it on YouTube and make a meme out of it? Not that I’m disagreeing with the sentiment, by the way,” she clarified.</p><p> </p><p>Ben had pulled out his phone and run a search while she was talking, and his face had gone white. Jen bet it was the GIFs. “Oh my god,” he said. “How are you backing me right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you kidding?” Jen said with a laugh. “This is <em>fun</em>. Sure, you’d be DOA if you were running on a Republican ticket, but initial polling has already got you as a favorite in the 18-29 age brackets. You’ve got momentum, Wyatt.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s something,” Ben agreed, but dubiously. Jen laughed again and filed away the rest of her own materials in her briefcase.</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” she agreed. “So, I gave your local team instructions for the next week. Let’s catch up next Friday?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, sure, of course,” he said, but before Jen could put a final cap on it, Ben continued: “Hey, do you want to grab dinner before you head to the airport? I know you’ve got a redeye, and there are some new spots that have popped up since the town merger that I think you’d actually like.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen chuckled and got out her phone to scan her emails. “Why?” she asked as she unlocked it.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, there’s this one place that does Turkish – “</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, glancing up, “I mean, why would we go out for dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>Ben had known her for too long to be offended. His voice was nonplussed when he said, “Well, I like to think we’re friends, at this point.”</p><p> </p><p>This casual assertion <em>did </em>get Jen’s attention, and Ben raised his hands when she looked up sharply.</p><p> </p><p>“Or… we aren’t?” he revised; but no, Jen was already rapidly realizing with dismay, he was right the first time, wasn’t he?</p><p> </p><p>God fucking dammit. Who could have foreseen that the stupidest, most meaningless moneygrab of her career would have led to a place like Pawnee, Indiana getting its claws in her <em>this </em>thoroughly? Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t correct him one way or another. And really, what <em>was </em>she going to do until her flight? Live large in Indianapolis? At ten o’clock on a Thursday?</p><p> </p><p>“You’re buying,” she said as she got up and slung her purse over her shoulder. “Well, come on, Ben; lead the way.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Now, Jen had always been able to admit where she was wrong or her assessment had changed, and this was true even when it came to the rapid transformation of Pawnee over the last six years from a stagnant nowheresville overrun by raccoons and fast food joints to a place that actually had legitimate small-town charm.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie’s town merger plan had been brilliant. Jen had thought so as soon as she’d heard about it, and had complimented her on it the first time she’d seen her again in person afterwards.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie had demurred and laughed her way through saying things she really, actually meant like “it was the right thing to do” and “it was the only way to save Eagleton” and “we help our neighbors around here” and then, finally, in a confidential undertone, “I mean, I wanted to throw up the whole time I was doing it, but, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t know, but more to the point, didn’t care, and had simply moved on by telling Leslie she’d been discussing it with some of her contacts in the DNC, who were also all similarly impressed.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Jen, you don’t have to – “ Leslie had said, but Jen was used to this song and dance, and only winked exaggeratedly. Oh come on, it was <em>fun. </em>Leslie blushed, grimaced in a way that wasn’t <em>not </em>a smile, said, reprovingly, “Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome,” Jen said, already dancing her way out of the conversation and halfway out of the room they were both in. “This one’s on me.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Jen.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“But if you wanna start thinking about the growing tab you’ve got with me, 2026 is just around the corner.”</p><p> </p><p>“2026?” Leslie echoed, alarmed, but underneath it… “What’s in 2026?”</p><p> </p><p>And there was the curious ambition Jen could always count on. She grinned. “Get those wheels turning, Knope. Great chatting, gotta go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, Jen – “</p><p> </p><p>There was simply no denying it: Pawnee had become an attractive place to live. Out of curiosity, Jen strolled through something they were calling “the commons”, which, besides having Leslie’s fingerprints <em>all </em>over it, was lined with townhouses and upscale apartment communities. (Or as upscale as apartment communities could get in Indiana; it was nice, but come on, they were still an hour and a half away from anything resembling an actual city in the Midwest.) The biggest street leading away from the park was thriving with new businesses, <em>actual </em>businesses, and bougie little restaurants and cafes with hipsters spilling out of them.</p><p> </p><p>One of them was her old hideout from the bygone Bobby Newport days, The Daily Grind, which she stopped into purely out of curiosity to find that Todd, now fully an adult, had solved his acne, was working on his online MBA, and had been promoted to manager. Ellen was reportedly on an Alaskan cruise with her son and was having the time of her life taking helicopter tours and playing with sled dogs. The wallpaper had changed; the booths had been renovated. Nothing looked the same, but still Jen walked out with her usual latte on the house and a genuine ‘<em>Hey, it was nice to see you again, Ms. Barkley’ </em>from Todd.</p><p> </p><p>Weirdly, though, this left Jen with the feeling that something… wasn’t <em>wrong, </em>per se, but like something was crawling up her back. Like something was here, just under the surface, waiting for her to name it.</p><p> </p><p>The Pawnee experience had always been something of an absurdist horror/comedy to her, so this was more of a genre shift than something totally out of left field. At this point she was ready to chalk it up to how rarely she returned to a place – any place – after a campaign was done. Usually she was in and out in a few weeks or months by virtue of the job. But Pawnee just kept sucking her back in, and it was getting harder and harder not to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Tonight, Ben ushered her to one of those same restaurants she’d taken note of near the commons: the promised Turkish place, which managed to straddle the line between laidback and upscale. Jen was begrudgingly impressed.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Ben said when they were seated, “how are things back in D.C.?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked up from her phone at him in surprise. “You mean… you’re asking about my personal life?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yeah,” Ben said, nonplussed. “It’s kind of what friends do.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned back in her chair. Things in D.C. were great. Her personal life was incredible. But she doubted that Ben Wyatt was ready to actually hear about the reason why: namely, that she was having a lot of really, really, <em>really</em> good sex, and frequently.</p><p> </p><p>She’d made a point of making damn sure she had an amazing sex life pretty much from the moment she realized she loved sex. And also that she happened to be incredible at it. Jen loved being incredible at things almost as much as she loved sex. Maybe more. Who was keeping track? When you were both things, like Jen, you could afford to not look too closely.</p><p> </p><p>The problem with most people was that they became predictable after a few proverbial rolls in the hay. And what Jen <em>didn’t </em>love was being bored. Especially during something she loved. It wasn’t her fault that she was so spectacular at sex that nobody could keep up with her. Time for everybody else to level up and thank her for the push.</p><p> </p><p>However. When it came to April Ludgate –</p><p> </p><p>Her phone chimed with a text notification.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hey when do you get back? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated for long enough with her hand over the phone without picking it up that Ben noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen?” he prompted, which was enough to push her into motion.</p><p> </p><p><em>Late tonight, </em>she typed back while simultaneously saying aloud in response to Ben’s original question, “It’s good. I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben paused to connect the dots, then chuckled. “Forthcoming,” he said as Jen put her phone back down and reached instead for one of the flatbreads in the bread basket.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay, I see. What do you want me to say?” she asked through a mouthful of bazlama. <em>Fuck </em>this was good. Why couldn’t Pawnee have gotten decent culinary options while she’d been stuck here for six consecutive brain-killing weeks?</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, that’s really up to you,” Ben said, eyeing her as she tore off another piece and stuffed it in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re really from the Midwest, aren’t you. Come on, hit me if you’re going to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Well, maybe this is a stupid question, but are you seeing anybody?”</p><p> </p><p>In perfect timing, her phone lit up with another notification. Thank god Ben was in fact from the Midwest and too polite to snoop. Jen snatched up her phone again anyway. Ben watched the movement, way too amused for his own good.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a yes?” he teased her. Jen ignored him and read the text:</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Yeah but what time? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She frowned. <em>Late, </em>she typed back. <em>Around 2. </em></p><p> </p><p>To Ben, she said, “No.” And then, smiling brightly, she continued, “but I am having an insane amount of killer sex.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-kay!” Ben said, just a hair too loudly, and Jen smiled as she took a satisfied sip of her water. “Well. I didn’t think that was new, exactly. For you. Is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Aww, Ben,” Jen said, amused. “Did you want the details? Because let me tell you – “</p><p> </p><p>“No!” he said in a hurry. “No, no, actually, that’s okay. I’m uh, I’m happy for you, though.”</p><p> </p><p>He probably meant it, too. Oh, Ben.</p><p> </p><p>Wait, was Jen actually feeling affectionate about it? Worse, was Ben smiling like that because he could tell she was?</p><p> </p><p>“It’s really nice to see you again, Jen,” which felt like the answer to that, and oh god, was he always this earnest? Jen fought not to wrinkle her nose. “I hope you don’t mind me saying, you seem really happy.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lucky I don’t mind you saying it, Wyatt,” Jen said dryly. “Just make sure you don’t make yourself too comfortable about it.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Ben just chuckled again. “I don’t think that’s a problem.”</p><p> </p><p>But Jen barely heard him, distracted by another table on the other end of the restaurant. Two women were seated together, probably a mother and daughter, both with dark hair, though Jen could tell that Mom’s was a bottle-job. Mom was also obviously an incurable hand talker, all big gestures and bigger expressions. The daughter, though, was exactly the opposite. Both were familiar, and Jen wondered…</p><p> </p><p>And there was that weird feeling again, settling over Jen’s chest. Like she was missing something. Like something was missing.</p><p> </p><p>Ben turned around to follow her gaze, and then looked back at her, surprised. “Oh. Do you know them?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t. Not even sort of. She shook herself out of it and said, “No.” Then she smiled winningly. “Hey, are you gonna eat that last flatbread? And where’s our server? I’d actually kill for some hummus.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ben said his goodbyes and wished her a safe flight when he dropped her off at her rental car, still parked outside the auditorium, at a quarter to 10.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure you’re safe to drive?” he’d asked, concerned, but Jen brushed him off. What was gonna happen to her in the hour and a half drive to Indianapolis – a cow wandering off a field?</p><p> </p><p>The thought made her sober, though, remembering an incident in Ohio. Yeah. She’d watch out for rogue cows.</p><p> </p><p>Pawnee was in her rearview in about five minutes, and with that done, Jen let herself think for the first time since she’d landed in Indiana on Tuesday about April Ludgate.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had only made the mistake of commenting on Pawnee’s dramatic evolution to April once. They’d just gotten back, separately, from their separate trips to Pawnee, neither of which had had anything to do with each other. April had been in town for a wedding. Jen remembered this because she’d taken great pleasure in fucking her in her purple bridesmaid dress against her hotel room door. Jen, for completely unrelated reasons, had chosen to get a last-minute flight to Indianapolis, rent a car, drive to Pawnee, and divebomb the Knope-Wyatts with a campaign pitch. Which, obviously, had worked out brilliantly.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation with April had gone less so, because it hadn’t really gone at all. Jen had mentioned something about Pawnee’s exploding population, and April had said “ha ha” and clammed up.</p><p> </p><p>And okay, sure, Jen had thought; that was her bad. There were after all some recent wounds there, what with the whole divorce thing and the family thing and the whatever had actually gone down with Leslie thing.</p><p> </p><p>But even taking that into consideration, April had been remarkably untalkative about Jen’s trips to Pawnee over the last few months, ever since the initial trip after Ben accidentally – and hilariously – pulled the ol’ campaign trigger.</p><p> </p><p><em>That </em>conversation had gone a little like this:</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>JEN: Hey, you know Ben Wyatt’s running for Congress, right?</p>
<p>APRIL: Yeah, he spilled about it at Donna’s wedding last month. Why?</p>
<p>JEN: Because I’m going to Pawnee on Thursday to coordinate with Ben’s local campaign staff.</p>
<p>APRIL: [pause] Okay. Was… that an invitation, or…</p>
<p>JEN: Oh. No. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>APRIL: So. Just an FYI?</p>
<p>JEN: Yes. I can hear now how it came across, though. Whoops.</p>
<p>APRIL: Okay. Well, good, because I didn’t wanna go, anyway.</p>
<p>JEN: Well, good.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>So clearly, any awkwardness: completely avoided. Dodged. One thousand percent. Great job as usual, Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s flight was too small to have a first-class cabin, but at least the fact that it was scheduled to leave at 1:15 a.m. meant that it was half-full at best. It was nearly 2:30 by the time they deplaned, but at least the route to escape to the rideshare pickup point was a familiar one. Jen exited through baggage claim and rifled through her apps as she joined the thin crowd of stragglers on the curb who were also trying to get the fuck out of here.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb was hovering over the “select ride” button when a voice called out, “Hey, you’re not really gonna call a ride when I drove all the way out here, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s head whipped up. So did everybody else’s, but Jen’s focus was on the speaker, who was about twenty feet away.</p><p> </p><p>“Is she talking to you?” asked some guy who’d just come outside with a tuba case six inches away from dragging on the ground next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously she’s talking to me,” Jen replied, irritated at the idea of an alternative, and walked away from him towards the spot where April Ludgate, in the flesh, was standing around waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p><em>What the hell are you doing here? </em>Jen managed to not say, but only just. “Why are you here?” was the question she actually got out, which was marginally better.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess… I wanted to see you,” April said with a shrug, only meeting her eyes at the end. “Weird, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at her, tilted her head. April’s lips were quirked just slightly into something that wasn’t quite a smile. Oh, something was happening, here, wasn’t it?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she agreed after a moment. “Pretty weird.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>And it <em>was </em>weird. It was weird as fuck.</p><p> </p><p>April led them to the garage and then down to the first level with Jen trailing behind her and intentionally not asking any of the several questions she had. Questions like <em>How long were you waiting out there? </em>and <em>When, exactly, did you decide to come out here? </em>and <em>Why this time? </em>Other questions like <em>Is this supposed to mean something </em>Jen eschewed as too easy. Obviously it meant something. The question was what, and what Jen was going to do about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” April eventually asked, and Jen jumped as April turned around to face her. “You’re being weird. What’s going on with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Jen muttered, and tugged her briefcase more tightly over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you can go back and get yourself your fancy Uber if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“And if I don’t want to?” Jen challenged.</p><p> </p><p>April raised her eyebrows. “Then… maybe you stop acting like a weirdo and give me your suitcase. And then I drive you home.” </p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Jen raised her eyebrows in return, stopped, and offered April the handle of her suitcase. April gave her the ghost of a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” she said and started walking again. “You can sleep in the car. I promise not to even draw on your face.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you trying to say something about the way I look?” Jen sniped, but tellingly, without any bite at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” April deadpanned, “I knew I was forgetting something. You look like shit.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, alright,” Jen grumbled as April grinned, this time widely, before her expression settled back into something more earnest.</p><p> </p><p>“So seriously, why are you making such a big deal of this?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not making a big deal of this!” Jen protested, reaching for the handy stash of affected innocence she kept for just these kinds of situations.</p><p> </p><p>To which April rolled her eyes. “Yeah, well, you’re not <em>not </em>making a big deal of this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, fine,” Jen said, and stopped walking. “Let’s get it out. Are you upset with me?”</p><p> </p><p>April’s surprise seemed genuine, and so did the laugh that followed. “Uh, no? Why would I be mad at you? Also, why would I have come all the way out to Dulles to give you a ride if I was mad at you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I don’t know!” Jen exclaimed. Why did April do anything she did? Why <em>was </em>April here? Jen didn’t know, that was for sure! “You’re upset every time I go to Pawnee. Don’t pretend you’re not."</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t deny it, at least. “Okay. Well, did you ever consider that it has more to do with Pawnee than you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Jen allowed, “but it doesn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>April laughed again, and turned and started walking past the endless rows of cars. “You are so unbelievable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I know,” Jen said as she followed her, earning her a scoff. “But that doesn’t answer my question.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not upset with you! God.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen ignored this lie. “Because I think you want to go to Pawnee. And I can’t figure out if you want to go on your own or if you want to go with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to go back to Pawnee,” April insisted. “And anyway, I was just there, for Donna’s wedding. Remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, Jen remembered, but she ignored this – and April’s leer – too. Jen had known April for what, five, six years now? She talked a good game but it was obvious to anyone with the fortitude to look past it that Pawnee had molded and formed her. Take the Pawnee out of the girl and she’d collapse into a puddle on the cement under their feet. What had also long, <em>long</em> since been clear to Jen, but only recently in ways she could fully appreciate, was how April had likewise molded and formed Pawnee.</p><p> </p><p>This was a sleeper talent, one April herself had also only recently become aware of, but not to its full extent. Not yet. Thank god, because it was also a talent that Jen wasn’t stupid enough not to be terrified of.</p><p> </p><p>They’d reached April’s car. April stopped again, turned, and caught something in Jen’s expression before Jen could retract it.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” April asked.  </p><p> </p><p>Jen moved rather than answer. While April wasn’t ready for her, she got there quick enough, moaning into a kiss that was almost immediately hot and open-mouthed. April’s ass hit the trunk of her car and they stumbled together as it shifted under their combined momentum, but it didn’t override the sensation of April’s grasping hands sliding restless over Jen’s back and into her hair, or her tongue sliding against Jen’s in a way that had Jen moaning back like language.</p><p> </p><p>“You taste like an airplane,” April complained into the space between their lips before Jen took control again.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not a thing,” Jen dismissed. Her voice was already short of breath. “Unlock the car.”</p><p> </p><p>April’s expression was hard to parse. But then there was the quiet, echoing <em>beep </em>indicating that the car had unlocked. “After you,” she said.  </p><p> </p><p>And Jen had never needed an engraved invitation. April handled the suitcase. Jen took the opportunity to strip off her tired blazer and kick off her shoes, and was in the middle of wet wiping her hands down when April climbed on top of her in the passenger seat and closed the door.</p><p> </p><p>“So, just to confirm,” April said, eyeing the wet wipes and taking one for herself, “we’re doing this? Here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Unless you have an objection,” Jen said. April was braless under her long sleeved shirt – no surprise there – and probably also commando under her jeans. Jen’s fingers were already itching to find out, and she let them dance over the hot denim seam separating her from April’s cunt. April pressed downward into her hand. Jen bit her lip, looked up to find April staring back, face in shadow.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said, and kissed her. Finally.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, can you just – " Jen started when they broke apart, but her words were interrupted by April grabbing her wrists and pinning them against the seat next to Jen’s shoulders, just below the headrest. Her eyes were intense, alive, thrumming with an energy that she was channeling directly into Jen as she moved her hands down, down, until she was pressing them against the seat on either side of Jen’s thighs. Jen swallowed, but held her head higher. Oh, she was in. She was <em>in. </em></p><p> </p><p>Which was good, because April was leaning into her ear. “Don’t worry. I know what you want. I know what you need,” she murmured into Jen’s ear, then dug her nails into Jen’s hands. “Sit on them,” she said, then tongued at her earlobe, swirled the tip around the tasteful pearl stud Jen wore, curling around the metal of the post back. “Up,” she prompted when Jen’s breathing stuttered and her hands flexed involuntarily, even as she willingly tucked them under her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>It was blindingly obvious what was going to happen from here, and so Jen was the opposite of surprised when April rose up on her knees, undid her fly, and slipped her hand into her jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“Imagine what your clients would say if they could see you now,” April told her, voice hypnotic enough that Jen listened. “All those uptight, old white men. They think you’re a shark, they’ve handed over their whole futures to you. They think you can give them power, and here you are, sitting on your fucking hands because I told you to. Just taking whatever I tell you to. Because you <em>asked </em>for it. At three in the morning in an airport parking garage.” April laughed, and the sound was maniacal. Jen was getting used to the fact that April was crazy, but that didn’t mean that it had stopped being a turn on yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this punishment,” Jen asked, mouth dry. “You’re punishing me, right? For going to Pawnee?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and watch me,” was her breathless non-answer, head tilting back on a choked-back moan.</p><p> </p><p>Not an explicit yes, but it never had been. Jen squirmed on top of her hands and gritted her teeth, tried not to groan when April grabbed the back of her neck with her free hand and wrenched it backwards with a fistful of hair.</p><p> </p><p>“You love it,” April said, not a question.</p><p> </p><p>Jen did. God, she really, really, really fucking did.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it,” April commanded.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it,” Jen gasped out, unashamed. “God, fuck. I love it.” </p><p> </p><p>If this was punishment, Jen decided, she’d take it, watching heavy-lidded as April came nearly silently, mouth open, face contorted, breath stopped.</p><p> </p><p>The smell of sex was just starting to permeate the cramped space, and Jen moaned when April kissed her sloppily and wiped her fingers on Jen’s five-hundred-dollar suit skirt.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t have the will or the energy to be upset about it, but still managed an “Oh, come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“We both knew you were going to dry clean it, anyway,” April said. “Especially after this. Switch positions with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen did, grumbling, more out of breath than she’d care to admit to being when they finally successfully reversed their positions and she ended up hovering over April’s lap, the skirt having been hiked up her thighs in the process.</p><p> </p><p>“We can stop anytime you want to,” April teased, palming the now-bare skin of her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare,” Jen said. “You got me here, now do something about it. You’re not driving me home until you get me off.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April agreed, eyes dark, and without further warning, her hand crept up Jen’s inner thigh and stole into her underwear, immediately circling Jen’s clit in a way that had Jen grinding down against her fingers: not enough.</p><p> </p><p>“More,” she demanded, voice husky. “Inside.”</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, April slipped two fingers inside of her without comment and simply watched her face. Jen probably should have known better than to trust it, but, always greedy, she broke her gaze a moment later when she leaned back and started riding those too-accommodating fingers.</p><p> </p><p>A light slap across her cheek – Jen gasped reflexively; there it was – had the effect forcing Jen into both alertness and submission.</p><p> </p><p>“Again,” she requested, breathless, and April obliged, harder this time. Jen’s hips stuttered, and then picked up their pace. This wasn’t going to take long. One hand braced herself against the roof while the other snuck under her underwear to circle her own clit shamelessly. “God, <em>fuck</em>, you’re good at this.”</p><p> </p><p>“So surprised,” April said, eyes gleaming as the low garage lighting hit them just right. Just right. “So you’re gonna come for me soon, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen moaned. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” April said softly, letting the palm of her spare hand rest against Jen’s cheek. It was a successful enough move that Jen never saw the next question coming.</p><p> </p><p>“How was Ben?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen froze – not because she was any less turned on, but because some alarm somewhere was blaring <em>Danger, Jen Barkley, danger! </em></p><p> </p><p>“So, this is a punishment,” she said, but the matter of fact tone she was aiming for was at least a little ruined by how wrecked her voice was.</p><p> </p><p>“No punishment,” April said, which was sure something to say when her fingers were squelching their torturously slow way through Jen’s cunt. The sudden gasp of breath Jen took might have sounded suspiciously like a squeak. “Just thinking about the dumb look on his face if he caught you getting fucked like this. In the front seat of a pre-owned Camry. And oh. By <em>me.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Several questions popped into Jen’s mind, chief among them <em>Do you want him to know? </em>and <em>Wait, is this doing something for you? </em>Still frozen with her own fingers on her clit and suspended over April’s lap, Jen considered her two options: to stop everything or to ramp it up.</p><p> </p><p>And, well. Jen was Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that what you want, babe?” she asked as her fingers started moving again on her clit and her orgasm sluggishly resumed creeping up the backs of her legs. “How about we take it further, huh? You come with me next time, and show me off to everybody in Pawnee – “</p><p> </p><p>Answers, finally, hitting in the way April immediately started to fuck her harder, almost unconsciously. Jen almost laughed in triumph.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be just like this, hmm?” she said, letting her eyes slip shut to imagine it. “You can put me – oh god – right where you want me. Show ‘em all who you are now.” Ben, Leslie, April’s coterie of friends, hell, even her ex – let ‘em watch, let ‘em see. It wasn’t like Jen had never considered the fun she might have had with either of the Knope-Wyatts, she wouldn’t have been picky about it –</p><p> </p><p>“You’d like that, huh?” April said, voice rough. “You want me to show you off with my fingers up your cunt? Dripping all over my wrist?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen moaned.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” April echoed, and laughed again, darkly. “I’d say I should have known but I did, didn’t I? What else, hmm? How about… how about on my knees, eating you out. Your pretty thighs framing me in between them. Tongue-deep inside you. And nobody can unhear the fact that I’m licking every last drop you have to give me from right out of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Jen said as the image washed over her. “Oh, god, <em>fuck.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“So you want it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I want it!”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess you’re right then,” April drawled. “We’ll just have to make it happen, won’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. “Can you – " Jen said urgently. “Your fingers – "</p><p> </p><p>April understood what she wanted, somehow, and curled her fingers inside of her – <em>perfect; </em>she might have even said so out loud – and Jen split her fingers into a “v” and milked her clit with her own slick, once, twice, three times, there, there, <em>there – </em></p><p> </p><p>April caught her with her free hand when she came and collapsed forward. Jen gave her credit: her fingers were still fucking her even through the awkward angle. A little clumsy, but Jen’s own fingers on her clit weren’t exactly elegant either now that they were trapped between their bodies. It did the trick, though, and Jen groaned when it was over. Her knees were killing her.</p><p> </p><p>“Better?” April murmured with an openmouthed kiss against her neck.</p><p> </p><p>No. Yes? Jen honestly didn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>“Take me home?” Jen said after a moment instead of answering, exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>Another moment, another kiss, this one with a hint of a bite, and then April patted at her to move backwards so she could get out. Jen managed it with another groan, and then worked on rearranging herself vaguely into the shape of a human with shaking hands.</p><p> </p><p>The driver’s side door opened. April slid inside and started the car, jeans buttoned, perfectly composed. “Ready?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>Jen blew her hair out of her face and turned her head to look at her. She was back to being unable to read April’s expression with a hundred percent certainty, and maybe that much was just how very, truly fucking late it was. But there was something else there too that was slapping Jen across the face softly and saying, <em>Hey, hey! Pay attention! </em></p><p> </p><p>Jen let her head tip back against the headrest. Reached up to grab the seat belt, buckled herself in.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, eyes closing. “Let’s go.”</p>

<em>Hi, April! It’s Ann. Long time no see, I guess, right? Wait! Before you press delete, just give me two minutes and just listen, okay? I heard about the divorce. You can probably also guess who told me. I hope you have a ton of other people you’re talking to about this – and like, you probably do, but – anyway, I just wanted to say, on the off chance you’ll actually consider it, that I’m here if you ever wanna talk. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Anyway, I just. You know. Wanted to reach out. I love you even if you hate me. And I love her but Leslie can be… oof. A lot. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Okay, that’s it. You can go ahead and delete this now if you want. But even if you do, feel free to call anytime. Okay, bye. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Wednesday.</p><p> </p><p>A full day of the satisfying work of telling people what to do and sending them far, far away from her, and Andy’s name popped up on April’s phone on her walk back to her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the first time. Obviously. April had picked up almost every call until she’d had to sit him down a few months ago at Donna’s wedding for the ‘hey, remember we’re divorced?’ talk for the sake of her not losing her fucking mind. </p><p> </p><p>For an insane second when Donna had called her and asked her to be her maid of honor, April had thought about inviting Jen as her plus one. That thought had really inconveniently reasserted itself more than once during the wedding itself, when it was too late to do anything about it, anyway. But for brief moments in between her duties as Chief Meagle Wrangler, April had allowed herself the luxury of fantasy. Jen would have distracted everyone with the absolute chaos she brought with her into any room where she wasn’t expected, and also a lot of rooms where she was. It would have given Leslie something new to gape at. Andy wouldn’t have been sad because he’d have been too busy being jealous. Jen probably would have even handled Meagle wrangling so efficiently that April herself probably could have just sat back with her feet crossed on top of one of the reception tables and admired the way she worked.  </p><p> </p><p>(“What?” Jen had asked when April finally got away from the rehearsal dinner, and Jen had finally divested her of her dress, and they were both finally sprawled out naked on the luxurious king-sized mattress Jen had sprung for herself at the best hotel Pawnee had to offer. April would later casually be invited to stay in a throwaway comment, but that would be another two hours from now.</p><p> </p><p>For now, April’s restless fingers paused in tracing unfinished shapes on Jen’s skin and around her areola. <em>Come with me tomorrow, </em>she wanted to say. <em>I don’t want to do this alone. </em></p><p> </p><p>But Jen wasn’t here for April, so April said, “Nothing,” and took Jen’s nipple between her thumb and her forefinger, and squeezed while staring her dead in the eye.)</p><p> </p><p>Now, April hesitated, weighed her options, stared at Andy’s name. Sighed. Answered the phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Andy,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, April!” Andy’s delighted voice said.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up?” Maybe, she hoped, he’d forgotten where the fuse box was. Or that she’d taken the slow cooker in the divorce and that’s why it wasn’t in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Welll…” he started in a tone that pretty much busted April’s hopes about that, and blew them up more when he said, “I’ve really just been wanting to talk to you, and I <em>kiiiinda</em> feel like you’ve been avoiding me?”</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, no shit. It wasn’t like walking away from a ten-year marriage to the love of her life was easy for her, either, but it also wasn’t like she could say that.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, okay,” she admitted, because Andy still deserved the truth. “I have been. I’ve been afraid of things being… awkward. Or like. I don’t know. I don’t know what we’re like when we’re divorced yet, and I guess I’m afraid to find out.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what we’re like when we’re divorced yet either,” Andy said. “But… maybe we could start finding out?”</p><p> </p><p>And what was April supposed to say to that? She sighed again, rolled her eyes, shifted uncomfortably where she’d stopped under a tree. It was bound on all sides by three large pavement squares and the curb. The light had changed behind her; a line of cars whooshed past April and the tree. She reached up to touch one of the young branches, still faintly green with spring. This couldn’t last forever, the tree and the cement. At some point the roots would start pushing up the pavement, or the cement would start eating into the soft outermost rings of the trunk. April knew; the education her time at Parks had given her was carved deep into her bones at this point.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” she said, giving into the inevitable. “Was there something in particular you wanted to talk about, or…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, so,” he said, “it might be too weird, and you might say ‘Andy, that’s weird’ and hang up and we’ll never talk again and – “</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, time to cut that off. “Andy, I <em>will </em>hang up if you don’t tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” he said quickly, “so I have a date on Thursday. Maybe. And I’m feeling. I don’t know. Kind of weird about it. Is that weird?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh. Somehow April hadn’t ever really thought about this happening.</p><p> </p><p>“It is weird, isn’t it?” Andy asked. April could picture the scrunch of his face, something <em>oh no- </em>and <em>I messed up-</em>adjacent, the nervous way her scratched his beard with one finger.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she lied.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it is. You know, we don’t have to – “</p><p> </p><p>“No, Andy,” April said. She put her head in her free hand, slouched over herself. Divorce sucked, divorce sucked, <em>divorce sucked. </em>“God. Yeah, you should go on the date. I want you to be happy. That was kind of the whole point of all of this.”</p><p> </p><p>Thank god Andy didn’t come back with something in his sweet, earnest voice about how <em>being with you made me happy, </em>because April knew now, the same way she had a year ago, that some bell had been rung when she wasn’t listening, that Andy would never stop resenting her in his honest, innocent way now that he’d started, that neither one of them would have survived it.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on the date,” April said again, more gently this time. “Just, you know. Let me know if she does anything something that means I need to come back and dig her eyeballs out with a fork. Because I will.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Andy said, and was quiet for a minute before he cleared his throat and said, “Uh, are you? Going on any dates?”</p><p> </p><p>Andy couldn’t see the blush, or her nervous eyeroll, but he’d gotten really good at reading her silences over the years. He laughed his stupid “gotcha” laugh, and April rolled her eyes again, this time affectionately.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he said with an effort at getting more serious, “so, you gotta let me know if <em>I </em>need to come out there and dig <em>his</em> eyeballs out with a fork.”</p><p> </p><p>“Andy.” They both knew that wasn’t the division of labor in their relationship.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, destroy his car. Kidnap his… cat? Uh. I don’t know, you’ll probably have to give me something to work with.”</p><p> </p><p>No way. Jen would eat him alive. Andy probably wouldn’t even get a chance to say anything.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not serious,” she said to put him out of his misery.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” he said, failing miserably at not being too audibly jealous. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I’m just… having fun. Is that okay?”</p><p> </p><p>It was Andy’s turn to be silent. “Yeah, babe. Of course. I want you to. I want you to be happy, too, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Aww, fuck. April wiped her eyes brusquely. “I know,” she said. “I know, Andy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, good.”</p><p> </p><p>For a minute, neither of them said anything. Andy didn’t even ask if April was still there. There was just their quiet breathing over the line, D.C. to Pawnee, and April’s hand on the soft, rough bark while a new line of cars started to rumble past again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, April?” Andy said finally. “I love you. You know that, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Andy,” she sighed, pressing her free palm against her eyes. Whatever, it wasn’t like her eyeliner wasn’t already fucked.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know, I’m not trying to – “ he said, and cut himself off. “I just mean, I love you, no matter what. And I always will. And I just… really need you to know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” she said, because she did. “I love you, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Later in her apartment, April abruptly picked up her phone again, searched through her contacts, and hit the call button. The phone rang three times before going to voicemail, and April stopped her compulsive foot tapping and hung up before she could be prompted to leave a message. It was a sign. Like seriously, what the fuck had she been thinking?</p><p> </p><p>Which was, of course, when her phone chimed with a text alert. “No,” she said to the universe while looking up at the sky. “I didn’t mean it. I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>The text was still there when she lifted up her phone and looked at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Omg April!</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m not ignoring you!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Herding kids</em>
</p><p>
<em>Call you soon</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Half an hour later, April let the call go to voicemail and kept reading her book, and definitely didn’t feel even sort of bad about it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Thursday.</p><p> </p><p>Late afternoon the day before the day before Memorial Day weekend meant the Foundation’s offices were almost empty. Almost empty, that was, except for Alyssa – who was always here, as the executive director – and April, who for some stupid reason had volunteered to lead a new stupid initiative in conjunction with the stupid University of DC. Which, somehow, had flashed her back in time <em>and</em> space to her current task: collating a mountain of papers and stuffing them into folders.</p><p> </p><p>Groaning, she pulled out her phone and hit Jen’s number.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she said when she picked up, evidently on speaker. “What are you wearing?”</p><p> </p><p>A standard greeting from Jen. “Oh,” April said, slouching in her chair and closing her eyes, “a <em>super</em> sexy combo of the blue cardigan, the blouse with the polka dots, and black pants.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmmm, librarian chic,” Jen vamped, which made the corners of April's lips quirk up, and then said, “So what’s wrong?” Which made her smile drop.</p><p> </p><p>“Does something have to be wrong?” she stalled.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, and the faint sound of typing stopped in the background. “But you could also save us both some time and just answer the question.”  </p><p> </p><p>April was used to Jen’s no-nonsense voice demanding no-nonsense answers, just like she was used to the boundaries of those demands. Jen didn’t care about the deeper lore of April’s existential questions or anything hinting at regret. April honestly wasn’t sure if Jen even <em>believed </em>in regret. That wasn’t their relationship – and that had actually been part of the draw from the beginning, the whole chaotic, commanding <em>make me forget about my divorce </em>thing that Jen brought to the table.</p><p> </p><p>Which was why saying <em>my ex called me </em>or <em>who’s this bitch my ex is going out with </em>or <em>was any of this, all of this, a mistake rolled up in other mistakes? </em>was not an option.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm, I don’t know,” she said, poking idly at one of her stacks of paper. “I volunteered myself to head up a collaboration with UDC and now I have to do extra work.”</p><p> </p><p>If Jen suspected this wasn’t the real answer, she didn’t let on. Instead, she laughed and said, “Hate to break it to you, but you’re just too competent.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to be competent,” April complained. “I never wanted to be competent. I just wanted to get paid for doing nothing. How did this happen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably somewhere in your years as a charismatic idealist’s right-hand woman, if I had to guess,” Jen replied in a distracted voice as the typing resumed.</p><p> </p><p>April groaned. “I swear to god, if you say one thing about me turning into Leslie – “</p><p> </p><p>“If you were turning into Leslie, we <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t have been doing what we were a few nights ago. Or<em> you </em>wouldn’t have been, anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Another day, April might have pressed on whatever <em>that </em>was, but today was not a think-about-Leslie day.  “Great,” she said, “so that means you’ll tell me when I start exhibiting signs of the charismatic-idealistic virus so I can break into the Pentagon, steal the top-secret vial of werewolf serum, and evolve into a mutant, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Jen’s voice drawled in a way that made the corners of April’s lips curl up. “You know, I always wanted to fuck a mutant.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, cool. I mean, I hadn’t pegged you as a monsterfucker, but cool. It’s good to have a plan for after the transformation, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>The typing stopped again. The silence stretched, and April lost her fight with her smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Honey,” Jen said deliberately, “you’ve still got no idea about all the kinks I have.”</p><p> </p><p>April considered that for approximately two seconds. “Hey, so. I can come over tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Seven,” Jen said.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“See you then,” Jen said, and hung up.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>April ended up seeing Jen sooner than seven, because she dropped by April’s office at the Foundation at four. April would know the <em>clack clack clack </em>of Jen's power heels as wielded by Jen's power stride anywhere at this point, and looked up to see Alyssa waggled her eyes at her behind Jen’s back before she disappeared again. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re too early,” April told Jen seriously when she waltzed into the conference room like she owned it. “I haven’t started plotting my heist yet. I don’t even know how I’m gonna break into the Pentagon.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen pulled out a chair and sank down into it while giving April a look. “You know they really don’t like those kinds of jokes here in D.C.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not joking,” April deadpanned. “I take monsterfucking very seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey April, can you close the door, please?” Alyssa’s mildly aggrieved voice drifted to them through the open door, but April wasn’t fooled. There was no one else left in the office, and she’d asked April about a million times for the details about what was going on with Jen, going all the way back to the night of that benefit where she’d seen Jen again for the first time in over a year and allowed her to lead her by the hand to the bathroom and then finger her stupid.</p><p> </p><p>Jen, who didn’t have a bone that could be shamed in her body that April had found yet, simply raised an eyebrow at April over the phone she was already bent over. April rolled her eyes and got up.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll try to keep it down,” she called back into the office. “You know, when we’re talking about all the freaky <em>sex </em>we’re about to have. Maybe even, I don’t know, on top of this table?”</p><p> </p><p>“Girl,” Alyssa’s voice warned, and April smiled to herself and shut the door.</p><p> </p><p>“So what does bring you here?” April asked Jen as she rounded the table again. “I thought I was coming over at seven?”</p><p> </p><p>“My last meeting ended early,” Jen said, still typing away on her phone. “I thought before all the freaky sex we could get dinner.” She looked up at April again, like she was belatedly confirming that this was an agreeable plan.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I did have dinner with George in accounting penciled in,” April joked, but Jen stiffened. Worse, she actually put down her phone. April stared back at her. “I was kidding,” she said slowly, eyebrows raising. “Dinner then freaky sex sounds great. Just give me a minute to finish this up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s George in accounting?”</p><p> </p><p>April laughed, disbelieving. “His name is George. He works in accounting.” She tilted her head. “Are you… <em>jealous?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Jen actually looked like she was actually thinking about her answer, which was concerning. </p><p> </p><p>“Okaaay,” April said slowly. “So, just in case this is somehow something that needs to be said, you’re the only person I’m going out with. Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>But Jen looked back, face blank. “Why is that obvious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because… <em>we’re</em> dating?”</p><p> </p><p>Or maybe, April realized for the first time, like a fucking idiot, this was actually not obvious – because Jen’s expression said she was doing some rapid-fire strategizing about the best way to tell April that they weren’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>The bottom had fallen out of April’s stomach, which was also simultaneously burning with horror and humiliation. So, a really great sensation all around. This was somehow worse than working up the sincerity and courage to tell Andy she loved him only to get a terrified “Awesomesauce!” back.</p><p> </p><p>Jen caught her wrist as April rounded the conference table on her way out the door and said, “Wait, give me a second – “</p><p> </p><p>But numbly, April shook her off. “Uh, I think I’m gonna go. I’ll just get – “</p><p> </p><p>Alyssa, catching sight of her as she walked out of the office without Jen in tow, half rose from her desk. “Whoa, April, are you – “</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t stop to hear the end of the sentence. She made it out of the building and onto the street into the pedestrian rush hour traffic before Jen caught up with her.</p><p> </p><p>“April, <em>stop</em>,” Jen said, authority ringing in her voice, and April hated herself only a little for stopping and turning around. At least Jen had the fucking decency to look like she was chasing after someone in heels. “This is a nonissue,” she said, as calmly and authoritatively as she could while pushing her hair back. “Ugh, god, this humidity is unbelievable already.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you seeing other people?” April demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Jen said, emphatic, but also looked – disgruntled about it? “Like I said: a nonissue.”</p><p> </p><p>And okay? “Then <em>what </em>is the problem?”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s no problem!” Jen insisted on a laugh that was running mania-adjacent at the very least. “Will you please come back inside and we can finish talking about this when we’re not surrounded by half of D.C.!”</p><p> </p><p>April crossed her arms. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean ‘no’?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, no, maybe I want half of D.C. to be part of whatever this is. Mostly because you don’t. Hey, sir? Sir,” April said, and stopped a passing white guy in a suit who’d made the fatal mistake of making eye contact with her. “Don’t you want to stay and find out whatever’s going on with Jennifer Barkley, famed political consultant extraordinaire – “</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, <em>enough,” </em>Jen snapped. “For fuck’s sake, let him go.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I could be into whatever’s going on here,” he said, looking between them even after April stopped pinching his jacket with a flourish. “So I’m guessing… you’re Jennifer?”</p><p> </p><p>April rolled her eyes. “No. She’s Ermintrude. The Destroyer of Worlds.”</p><p> </p><p>Pawnee guys would have already left, the weirded-out having won over the horny. That was April’s mistake: she kept forgetting she was in D.C. now.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” D.C. Guy said smoothly with a too-smooth smile he’d probably practiced five hundred times in the mirror when he was seventeen. “Ermintrude. Cool name. Unusual.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Jen muttered, irritation lacing the way she pushed her hair back one more time. “Please take a hint. <em>We</em>,” this was said with a gesture to herself and April, “are having sex with each other, not you. This is not the beginning of a negotiation. There is no room for your penis in what’s happening here. Go.” Still, D.C. Guy hesitated. <em>“Depart,</em>” Jen said more emphatically, and something about it finally got him to start moving.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay,” he said, readjusting his jacket and walking away. “Pro tip, though – “</p><p> </p><p>“Best of luck out there, buddy, knock ‘em dead!” Jen cut him off with her best aggressive smile, and then turned and rolled her eyes at April with one hand on her hip. “Well, that was fun,” she said, while her face clearly expressed that actually, it had Not Been Fun. “Are you happy now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” April admitted, who had been Not Having Fun for a while now and didn’t mind saying so. “I still don’t hear an explanation about what your problem is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine!” Jen shouted. “You want to know what my problem is? My problem is that I <em>don’t do this!” </em></p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean you don’t do this?” April shouted back.</p><p> </p><p><em>“This!” </em>Jen said, waving her hands around to indicate the entirety of the general situation. “Feelings! Relationships! Chasing after people like I’m at the end of an early 2000’s rom com starring Kate Hudson!”</p><p> </p><p>“Neither do I!”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>literally </em>just got out of a ten-year marriage!”</p><p> </p><p><em>“Exactly!” </em>April said like Jen had just proved her point. “Okay, fine,” she said, rolling her eyes when she evidently heard just how stupid her own words sounded. “But this wasn’t supposed to be that. You were interested and here and <em>hot </em>and you didn’t make me talk about it. But guess what, turns out I have feelings for you too, oh no! So it’s pretty inconvenient for me, too!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Jen said indignantly. “What do you mean, ‘pretty inconvenient’?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it’s pretty inconvenient when the person you have feelings for <em>doesn’t like you back. </em>Jesus, did you miss middle school or something? This is, like, basic shit, Jen!”</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa, hold on a minute, I pretty fucking explicitly <em>do </em>like you back!” Jen said. “<em>That’s </em>what the problem is!”</p><p> </p><p>April stared at her. “That’s not a fucking problem!” she shouted.</p><p> </p><p>A random athleisure-wearing passerby decided that this was a great time to interject their own wisdom at this point: “Hey, sorry, I couldn’t help but overhear, but just as a third-party opinion: I agree with her,” she said, pointing to April.</p><p> </p><p>“Who asked you?” Jen demanded. The passerby sped up her pace with her kid-occupied stroller in front of her as Jen started stalking her. “Yeah, think about it harder next time!” she called after her as she disappeared down the pavement, then whirled back around on April. “Ugh, why are we doing this out here, anyway? <em>Please</em>, can we just go back to the incredible sex?”</p><p> </p><p>It was tempting, but April was starting to get good at knowing when her relationships were falling apart.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said, but the fight had deflated her voice, and she crossed her arms protectively across her chest. Whatever. Jen knew all her tells, anyway. “No, I think… I think I’m gonna go home.”</p><p> </p><p>April got ten steps away before the sound of Jen’s stalker heels caught up with her. “I’m sorry,” she demanded, “did you just break up with me?”</p><p> </p><p>April shrugged, shifting to stuff her hands in her pockets instead. “Well, according to you, there wasn’t anything to break up. So I guess technically no.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck that,” Jen snapped. “Fuck <em>you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure I said that was a no from me, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, can you be an adult for one second here?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, Jen, which one of us is the one who’s had a ten-year marriage?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you’re going there as a qualification for adulthood? Alright, then which one of us is the one whose ten-year marriage <em>failed?” </em></p><p> </p><p>It took a shit ton of restraint to keep herself from shouting back, but April managed it. Jen deflated slowly, in pieces, when she spotted April’s clenched jaw and whatever she wasn’t keeping off her face. Yeah, well, it had fucking hurt, just like Jen had no doubt intended it to. She could deal with seeing it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said gruffly, stopping and dragging her hands over her face. “I didn’t – “</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you did,” April said.</p><p> </p><p>At least Jen didn’t waste either of their time denying it. “Okay, I did. But I shouldn’t have said it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I don’t know if that’s much better if that’s really what you think of me,” April said. “Is it?” Jen scoffed, but that wasn’t a <em>no </em>this time, either. April scoffed too and looked away from her. “Okay, so… we’re just wasting time, here, then. You hate marriage. And, like, dating, apparently.”   </p><p> </p><p><em>“Whoa,” </em>Jen said. “When did we start talking about marriage? I wasn’t talking about marriage. Were you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, but I liked being married. I don’t not want it again,” April said, shifting her weight between her feet. “But I mean, I guess it doesn’t really matter since we broke up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop saying that!” Jen snapped. “Fuck. <em>Fuck! </em>Give me a second.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can have all the seconds you want,” April told her. “I’m going home. Don’t follow me.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Three hours later, when she was currently not having any sex at all, freaky or otherwise, April sighed, pulled out her phone, and hit the contact for “skanky ho” for the second time in a week.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Ann answered after two rings. “April!” she said. “Hi! Oh my god, I… can’t believe you called me back.”</p><p> </p><p>April shut her eyes. “Yeah, this was a mistake. Actually, who is this? Sorry to bother you, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“April, I know you meant to call!” Ann’s tinny voice shouted urgently from the speaker when April took the phone away from her ear. Grudgingly, April put it back. “Are you still there?” Ann’s disembodied voice came again at normal volume.</p><p> </p><p>“Reginald?” April said, just to fuck with her.</p><p> </p><p>“Ha ha,” Ann said. “So if you’re calling <em>me</em>, something’s really gotta be wrong. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>April sighed, paused, bent over her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“April?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, so, I’m gonna tell you something, and you absolutely cannot go telling Leslie, or Ben, because that’s basically the same as telling Leslie,” she said in a rush.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, of course,” Ann assured her. “I <em>do </em>know how to keep a confidence, even from Leslie.”</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, that was up for debate, Reginald. April squeezed her eyes shut. “So, I’ve been seeing Jennifer Barkley and I think we just broke up.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence. Then –</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” Ann said. “Back up. Jennifer Barkley? Who ran Bobby Newport’s city council campaign? Who’s running Ben’s congressional campaign? <em>That </em>Jennifer Barkley?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, the Jennifer Barkley who’s the second richest widow in the world,” April deadpanned. “The one who threw her husband overboard on their yacht in Sicily? Yeah, we’re going to combine her money and my plans and take over the world.”</p><p> </p><p>“And, wait – <em>seeing? </em>Like, <em>dating?” </em>Ann said, who was apparently still easily able to pass over April’s batshit sarcasm. Shame.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess?”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>guess?” </em>Ann exploded. As much as anybody could explode in a whisper. There was the faint sound of a door closing on her end, like she’d just shut herself in a room where she could explode in not-a-whisper. “How long has this been going on?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” April said, tapping her foot impatiently, uncomfortable, “like half a year?”</p><p> </p><p><em>“April, </em>oh my god. Does Ben know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that’s why I asked you not to tell him,” April said, rolling her eyes. “<em>No </em>he doesn’t know. Keep up, Reginald.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying!” Ann exclaimed. “Okay, okay. You’re dating Jennifer Barkley. I’ve adjusted. I’m guessing you didn’t call just to drop this piece of information?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I called because I think I’m <em>not </em>dating Jennifer Barkley, and you’re the only person I know who wouldn’t have, like, a massive freakout or breakdown about it. Except oh wait, you just did that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you know I didn’t,” Ann said, unimpressed. “But yeah, I’m allowed to be a little surprised by this news. And that you’re calling <em>me </em>about it. Also, wait, go back to the thing where you think you broke up?”</p><p> </p><p>April should have. It was the whole reason she’d called. But instead, April’s foot bounced more erratically, and what abruptly came out of her mouth instead was, “Do you think I made a mistake divorcing Andy?”</p><p> </p><p>Ann’s surprise at the question was palpable through the phone. “Oh,” she said. “No. No, April, I don’t. I actually think that if you hadn’t, based on what I know, you’d both have been miserable one way or the other.”</p><p> </p><p>April took a deep breath, let it out. “Yeah,” she said. “That’s what I think, too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Ann said quietly. “I’m glad. Can I ask, though, I’ve been curious – how did you decide?”</p><p> </p><p>April could say the obvious: Andy wanted kids, she didn’t, it took them too long to actually talk about it. But Ann already knew that much. Everybody did, probably, at this point.</p><p> </p><p>“I, uh, talked to someone who figured me out pretty fast,” she said, just as quietly. “Everything was already, you know, terrible. Andy was upset with me all the time. Nobody else understood. It felt like everybody was just like, well, it’s time for April to grow up, and why wouldn’t I want to have kids with my husband if I loved him that much?”</p><p> </p><p>Ann was quiet for a minute, and April picked nervously at a hangnail until it bled, then sucked it.</p><p> </p><p>“This person who figured you out,” Ann said. A question.</p><p> </p><p>April nodded, took her finger out of her mouth, looked away even though Ann couldn’t see her. “Jen,” she confirmed.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah.” She was quiet again for a while, and come on, Ann, don’t you know the point of a phone is that you’re supposed to <em>talk? </em>April managed not to say this, and Ann didn’t ask any of the other questions that April could tell she definitely wanted to ask.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t tell Leslie,” April blurted into the silence. Like a teenager, god.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not gonna tell anybody,” Ann reassures her. “I promise. But, speaking of, you know who would be a thousand percent in your corner and actually lives in the same city as you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, Sonia Sotomayor?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, then,” April said, like it was obvious. “Bernie Sanders.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“April.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“If you say Leslie – “ April said, a warning in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know, she fucked up,” Ann said. “For what it’s worth, she knows she did, and she’s dying to make it right. She’s been waiting for you to come to her. And we both know how hard that is for her.”</p><p> </p><p>April felt the stupid telltale prickle of tears against her eyelids. “Yeah, well, she did fuck up.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Ann repeated. “I told her she did. So did Ben. I’m not defending her, but you know how she is – she hates change, especially when that change is to her family. She loves you. And she loves Andy. And she just – really wanted it to be enough for you to love each other. It’s always been really hard for her to understand that what makes her happy doesn’t necessarily make everyone else happy, but on this one? I promise, she did eventually get there.” A beat. “Also, I know you’ve got another older woman in your life now, but – “</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god. Goodbye, Reginald,” April said, and hung up on the sound of Ann snickering.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>(“Oh my god, what are you doing here?” April exclaimed after Donna’s rehearsal dinner, completely giving herself away with a full smile that Jen immediately kissed.</p><p> </p><p>“Working,” Jen eventually replied several long minutes later; but April, who had forgotten the question, grabbed her by the lapels of her blazer to shut her up and drag her into first another kiss, and then the open door of Jen’s hotel room.</p><p> </p><p>Tomorrow, Donna would ask Ben why he hadn’t told them he was running for Congress, and April would put together the pieces.</p><p> </p><p>But that was tomorrow.)</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Friday.</p><p> </p><p>April hadn’t been back to the Department of the Interior since the last time she’d been here on a work trip with Leslie, but this also felt like a fold in time and space, a version of herself superimposed on another version of herself until she felt like she was about to throw up with déjà vu or grief. Or maybe it was just nerves. April had approximately zero intention of digging too deep on this one, and was honestly reaching a critical point where she was rethinking this whole field trip entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Which was when Leslie caught sight of her from her office.</p><p> </p><p>“April!” she yelled. “Oh, my god. April! Wait, wait, wait - ” Then, to whoever was on the phone, “Sorry, Senator, so sorry, I’mgonnahavetocallyourightback, sorrybye – April! April!”</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Leslie cover twenty feet in two seconds had always been impressive. April would admit there was a small, tiny, miniscule part of her that was gratified that she was the impetus at the end of those twenty feet. Still more impressive was the fact that Leslie held herself back from throwing her arms around April, especially considering the way that restraint had written itself as actual, physical pain across her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Diana, hold my calls and clear my afternoon,” was her next, breathless instruction to the person who had just tried to turn April away.</p><p> </p><p>April shifted with the discomfort of being the object of Leslie’s focus after all these months of a self-imposed Leslie vacuum. “I don’t think – “</p><p> </p><p>“<em>The whole afternoon</em>,” Leslie said without looking away from her. Holy shit, had she somehow gotten even <em>more </em>intense in the last few months?</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Knope, the meeting with the Senator took three months to schedule – “</p><p> </p><p>“Well, tell him that a family emergency has come up and we’ll wait another three months.”</p><p> </p><p>“When’s the meeting?” April asked Diana, who looked affronted, but replied, “Three o’clock.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll be done by then,” April assured her.</p><p> </p><p>“We will?” Leslie said with big wet eyes that had April rolling her own with rusty affection and hooking her arm through Leslie’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah” she said. “Come on. Let’s do this… somewhere else.” Somewhere <em>Diana </em>wasn’t putting the evil eye on her.</p><p> </p><p>But Leslie wasn’t looking at Diana. Leslie was looking at April like she would go with her anywhere. And April would never say this, even under pain of death, but… maybe Ann was right.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Leslie agreed, still looking at April, this time with a smile. “We’ll be back by three.”</p>

<p>“But who do you think it was?” Leslie wondered aloud for approximately the thirty thousandth time since April had – thank god – made the first step to reconcile with Leslie a few weeks ago. “And why won’t she tell me? That’s weird, right? It’s weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben didn’t have any more of an idea than he’d had the first twenty nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine times, but he had to admit, he was curious, too. “I don’t know,” he said patiently. “I’m sure she’ll tell you when she’s ready.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think she thinks I’m upset because it was a woman? I mean, I’m a famous gay icon!”</p><p> </p><p>“In Pawnee,” Ben felt it was relevant to remind her.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie waved this off like it didn’t matter. “I’m working on it in here, too. Give me like, thirteen months. Maybe fourteen.”</p><p> </p><p>Oddly specific, but Ben knew better at this point than to doubt that his wife’s ability to achieve goals when actual timelines were in play and they had the mutual connections they did. “She’s probably just feeling out your relationship again,” Ben said, also not for the first time. “Things are a lot different than they were a year ago, for both of you. Besides, what would you even do if you knew who it was? It’s not like you’d hunt her down and yell at her.” But Ben reconsidered before the words finished leaving his mouth. “Wait.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Leslie dismissed. “Of course not. I just want to know who so I can hunt her down and have stern, emphatic, reproving words with her that make her reconsider ever doing this again to anyone else for as long as she lives, and maybe also prompting her into fixing things with April once I get a sense of the situation. I’m not unreasonable, Ben.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, of course not,” Ben agreed, eyebrows raised, but Leslie was already onto her next sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“Besides, yelling at whoever this mystery woman is would probably ruin any chance I had of fixing this.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s something you can fix regardless,” Ben said, taking Leslie’s shoulders in his hands gently in a practiced move that brought her finally, if temporarily, to rest. The anguish was starting to poke through her face again, and uh oh, time for a redirect. “Hey, when’s she coming over for dinner this week, again? Friday?”</p><p> </p><p>Leslie brightened at that – redirect successful! – before she ran through her mental calendar. “No, Thursday. Friday is Jen,” she said, pulling out her phone to confirm on her calendar. “Or we’re in trouble, because all three kids are at three different sleepovers on Friday and I swore to Jen that she wouldn’t need to wear a poncho this time.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben checked his own with sudden trepidation – oh thank god, it was in fact April Thursday, Jen Friday – and put it back down on the counter when he’d confirmed. “At least we didn’t double book them on the same day. Can you imagine the two of them together? I mean, no, really, can you imagine it, because I’m having trouble.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I’m trying,” Leslie said, her expression indicated she was far, far away in a world where April Ludgate and Jen Barkley were interacting in the same room, “and I can’t really decide if they’d hate each other or…”</p><p> </p><p>“Stage a world coup in the most chaotic way possible?” Ben offered.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie grimaced. “Yeah,” she said. “Good thing we didn’t double book. I mean, can you imagine?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Thursday-April went off without a hitch.</p><p> </p><p>The last time Ben had actually spent time in person with April had been when she’d moved to D.C…. almost a year ago now, Jesus. He had a vague memory of pulling her into a very tipsy and definitely too-exuberant-for-April hug at Donna’s rehearsal dinner at Tom’s Bistro. To Ben’s memory, April had actually accepted the hug with minimal comments about him being a weirdo and barely-concealed amusement in the way she patted his back.</p><p> </p><p>He’d also missed April, so sue him! And he’d just been approached (ambushed) with the very real possibility of running for <em>Congress, </em>and he was thinking about doing it! He could be <em>Congressman Wyatt. </em>He’d said some or all of this, and April had raised her eyebrows, and said <em>cool, also, you’re drunk. Do you know you’re drunk, Ben?</em></p><p> </p><p>The next day, waiting for Jen Barkley to arrive at JJ’s so he could chew her out while on his third cup of coffee as medicine for a truly <em>enormous</em> hangover, he had a vague memory of the conversation and winced. Leslie had groaned in the booth across from him with her own hangover, and then Jen had slid in next to her with a grin, and Ben had forgotten that he probably owed April an apology for… whatever that had been.</p><p> </p><p>“You look like shit,” Jen had remarked cheerfully as she’d asked Marta for a cappuccino of her own. “Fun night?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t talk to me,” Ben had replied. Leslie had groaned again.</p><p> </p><p>Predictably, Jen had ignored both of them. “I had a great night, too, thanks for asking. I look fabulous, though. If this is what having kids does for your stamina – "</p><p> </p><p>Those kids, Ben was glad to see, still remembered April. He and Leslie had done a little prompting when they’d told them that Aunt April was coming for dinner, remember Aunt April? They’d said yes, but Ben had been skeptical until they’d pulled April by the hands out into the backyard and into a game of something that could passably be soccer, if you squinted.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie had excused herself inside for a minute, overcome with emotion. But Ben had let himself watch for another minute, ostensibly to make sure April was okay outnumbered three to one, but also just – breathe. And be happy. April looked good. Happy. Maybe it really could be this easy.  </p><p> </p><p>April had caught him in the middle of his moment, and had whispered something to the kids, who all turned to him with identical, terrifying grins, and charged him. April had passed by him on her way back into the house and said, “Don't be a loser about it, Dad,” but if she was trying to hide the affection in it, Ben could still hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Friday-Jen began with Ben answering the door with an apology: “Hi Jen,” he said warmly. “Leslie’s running a little late, but  - " He paused, then frowned, because Jen was wearing another of her plastic ponchos. “Did you buy those in bulk?”</p><p> </p><p>“It was a 20-pack,” Jen said breezily and let herself in when he moved to the side to give her space to get around him. “<em>Great </em>value. Actually, I just have these on hand all the time now. I’ve got a pack in my car for emergencies.”</p><p> </p><p>“We did tell you the kids are at sleepovers tonight, right?” he called after her as he closed the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Just because they’re not here doesn’t mean that they haven’t left little sticky surprises behind for me, Benjamin. Respectfully, the poncho stays <em>on</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben actually couldn’t argue with that logic, especially when just yesterday morning Ben had sleepwalked through breakfast with his D.C. campaign head of marketing with some kind of science experiment slime crusting on his jacket.</p><p> </p><p>“Love the new place,” she said, looking around. “So what’s the plan with your in-state residency?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Ben said, “if I win – "</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll win,” Jen said, no-nonsense as ever, with a toss of her hair and without looking at him. Was the arrogant conviction of her own certainty more about her own skill or her belief in Ben? Ben couldn’t help his small smile about it either way. Ben liked pulling the strings, but there was an undeniable relief in the fact that Jen was the one doing so instead.</p><p> </p><p>“The plan is I’d commute between here and Pawnee. We’ll keep both houses. I don’t think Leslie will ever want to let go of Pawnee entirely, and she likes working at the Interior, but – “</p><p> </p><p>“But she wants to run for office again,” Jen finished as she straightened, focusing on Ben with the keen senses of a bloodhound who had smelled the fresh scent of political interest in the water. This was confirmed when she followed that up with, “Am I right? Fucking <em>finally.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>With a silent apology to Leslie for potentially siccing Jen on her, Ben chose to sail right on past that by saying, “So, the plan is for the kids to go to school here during the school year and we all spend summers in Pawnee.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm,” Jen said, nodding sagely, pointing a finger at him. “Besides seeing what you just did there, terribly, that’s not a bad strategy.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, no cracks about Pawnee?” Ben joked, but Jen just waved a dismissive hand at him and moved into the kitchen. He hurried after her.</p><p> </p><p>“So this place is looking pretty great already,” her voice drifted back to him as he pushed through the door. “When did you move in, again? I would have thought you two would be the type to rock the ‘too busy to unpack the boxes we shoved into the corners for a few months’ kind of aesthetic.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, we got this place a while ago, when Leslie started spending so much time travelling here,” Ben said. “I spent the first part of my adult life living out of hotels – okay, <em>motels,</em>” he corrected when Jen threw him a look saying she knew everything about him, thank you very much, “and, well. We both kinda figured we’d end up in a job situation like this down the line, with the way things were going.”</p><p> </p><p>“Planning ahead,” Jen said approvingly. “That’s the kind of confidence I like to see in my candidates.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it was more because of Leslie. This kind of came out of the blue.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you’re welcome,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Ben agreed, belated, with a small smile. “But yeah, Leslie was getting tired of the hotels. I think it was different when April was travelling with her, but – oh,” Ben cut himself off. He knew Jen well at this point, well enough to spot when something had surprised her. “Wait, you might have met April,” he said, taking a stab at what it might be about. “She worked with me on Murray’s congressional campaign all those years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I remember some intern who worked on a congressional campaign six years ago?” Jen said, dismissive.</p><p> </p><p>But the exact number of years she’d specified – six – caught Ben by surprise. He probably couldn’t have told you offhand what year that had been, except that, yep, it was the summer before he married Leslie. 2012. So, yes: six years ago. But only after he’d thought about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, yeah, six years,” Ben said. “I’m surprised you remember that. You’ve been involved in a lot of campaigns since then.”</p><p> </p><p>“As we’ve established on multiple occasions,” Jen said, deadpan, “I’m incredible.” But, knowing Jen as he did now, he didn’t miss the look that crossed her face that told him that she’d given something away without meaning to. “Whew, I’m parched,” she said before he could press her about it. “Can’t even get a guest a drink, Wyatt? Don’t make me guess your glassware storage system.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Jen kept him well away from whatever <em>that </em>had been, skillfully enough that he’d almost forgotten about it by the time Leslie came home bearing two stapled-shut bags of takeout she’d picked up on the way home, as promised, from their roster of Jen-approved restaurants that also offered takeout.</p><p> </p><p>Leslie got a call in the middle of dessert that she slipped away to the living room to take after he and Jen waved her on, Jen with a “Tell Doug I said hi!”</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Ben began as a scintillating conversational opening. Jen barely looked up from her phone, which she’d picked up as soon as Leslie stepped away, thumbs flying over the screen. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’ve seemed a little… off, recently.”</p><p> </p><p>That got her to look up, affronted. “Is that a comment on the way I’m running your campaign, Ben? Because I’m handling this myself as a favor to you, but I can hand you over to one of my junior partners any time you want. Just say the word.”</p><p> </p><p>Yikes. “That’s definitely not what I want,” he assured her carefully. “I’m a full nineteen points up in the polls. Even if I didn’t have firsthand knowledge that you’re the best at what you do, I’d be an idiot to want to hand over the reins to anybody else.”</p><p> </p><p>“Damn straight,” she muttered and shifted in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>“I just mean – you seem. Unsettled,” Ben tried. “On a personal level, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen fixed him with a forthright stare. “Oh, is this because of the friends thing?” she asked. “That’s what’s going on here, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Ben raised an eyebrow. “Yes. Sure is.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen thankfully didn’t argue the existence of their friendship with him this time around and merely pursed her lips. The compulsive drumming her fingers had taken up on the table reached a frenetic rhythm before she finally broke with a sigh and – almost shockingly – a slump. She attempted and aborted three different sentences before any words left her mouth. Ben waited patiently, increasingly actually concerned, and was rewarded when finally admitted, “I think I fucked things up with somebody I’ve been seeing.”</p><p> </p><p>Ben tried to tamp down on his surprise, both at the admission and the additional puzzle piece she was handing him. “I didn’t know you were seeing anybody,” he said in an attempt to keep to a moderate response. “I didn’t know that you… <em>saw </em>anybody at all. Like that. Do you… wanna talk about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s hands lifted in a helpless gesture while her lips quirked in irritation. “I don’t know. Do you have some Midwestern corn-fed magic bullet solution?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably not,” he acknowledged, “but I’m willing to give it a shot.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen sighed. “I’ve been seeing a woman, so let’s get any shock about that out of the way first, because I’m not mincing around pronouns.”</p><p> </p><p>The idea of Jen sleeping with, or even dating, women didn’t even come close to breaking the barrier of things Ben thought he might actually be surprised by when it came to Jen’s sex or personal life. “Consider it gotten over,” Ben said kindly. “So what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the worst thing: I don’t even know. We were having tons of sex – really good, too, by the way, in case you were wondering – " (“I wasn’t,” Ben muttered, “but thanks.”) “ – and then suddenly she’s talking about relationships and <em>marriage. </em>And I’m on the sidewalk like an idiot wondering what the fuck just happened. Which is <em>not </em>a position I’m used to finding myself in, Ben!”</p><p> </p><p>No, he didn’t suppose it was. “So, was it her bringing up marriage – “</p><p> </p><p><em>“No,” </em>Jen cut him off, emphatic. “I mean, if she’d done it earlier before she started saying that we’d just broken up, then maybe – “</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh. Yikes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Ben, <em>yikes,” </em>Jen agreed. “But the whole breaking up with me first made that whole item generally moot. That was just for kicks, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Ben said, burning with curiosity, “<em>how</em> long had you been seeing each other?”</p><p> </p><p>“Half a year, give or take,” Jen said, waving a hand.</p><p> </p><p>“And were you thinking – or was she thinking – about marriage? Like, to each other, in a serious way?”</p><p> </p><p>“Having trouble imagining it, aren’t you?” Jen joked, but then sobered before he could say something about it. “No. I don’t think so. She’s just been married before. I think the bigger ticket item on the split-second decision to break things off was this idea she had that I didn’t want to do this for real. Admittedly, I maybe could have been cooler about communicating that I did, but I also didn’t realize we were at a make-or-break kind of moment. And I’m also not used to being in that place. Now, she’s not answering my calls or texts, and her boss won’t let me in her office. Stalking her into apartment doesn’t seem like it’ll earn me points. So,” Jen said, picking up her water glass and swirling around the half-melted ice, “let’s hear what magic bullets you have in your arsenal.”</p><p> </p><p>Now, Ben wasn’t an idiot. He was actually pretty smart. And his brain was currently synthesizing several things into what felt like a <em>very </em>improbable version of the truth.</p><p> </p><p>The first: what his brain hadn’t been entirely able to let go of all evening, Jen’s on-hand grasp of the specifics of the Murray campaign. Six years ago. On which April had, in fact, been an intern.</p><p> </p><p>The second: Leslie’s nonstop worrying about April since April had reached out to her again about a month ago… having described a recent heartbreak with a woman she’d been seeing. One she wouldn’t name. One who didn’t want commitment.</p><p> </p><p>The third: Jen’s comments about her own mystery woman having been previously married, and possibly marriage again.</p><p> </p><p>Ben felt delirious with the implications. There was no way, right? ‘Oh, thank <em>god </em>they hadn’t double booked them’ was an incredibly fervent thought that coexisted alongside the equally fervent, ‘Leslie is going to lose her mind.’</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, so,” Ben said slowly. “I’m gonna ask what might be a very, very stupid question, but… the woman you were seeing…” he paused, because Jen had affected the most bored, uninterested expression she could probably muster. Like an idiot, Ben pressed forward anyway, and in a hushed voice, he asked, “Was it… <em>April Ludgate?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Jen maintained her expression long enough that Ben started to sweat with the frankly very high probability that he was wrong. God, what an <em>absurd</em> thing for him to have said. Jen probably didn’t even know who April was. And even if she did, there were a dozen reasons connected with Ben’s campaign, or even Leslie’s a million years ago. But then, just as Ben was about to retract the question, Jen’s expression shifted enough to give her away, and her eyes shifted away and then back to Ben.</p><p> </p><p>Wait. <em>Wait. </em>For real? He was actually right?</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously?” he said, voice embarrassingly high. Jen rolled her eyes. “Wow. Uh. I have so many questions. Like, <em>so </em>many questions.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pick two,” Jen advised him.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Um. <em>When?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Not that long ago. A few months.”</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, that was right, she’d already said that one. Focus, Ben. “How did you even… I don’t know, meet?” he asked, and then, because he had to be somehow even <em>more </em>awkward about this, “Form an interest?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, keep up, Ben,” Jen snapped, but affectionately enough that he relaxed. “Don’t make me regret giving you more credit than most candidates I work with. Is it really that unbelievable to you that we’ve been crossing paths for years now between the various campaigns we’ve been involved in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, no, I guess not, but – “</p><p> </p><p>“Good, because you’re out of questions,” Jen cut him off. “Look, I feel like I already made a pretty dick move in telling you about this before she could. Or, fuck, telling you at all. So if we can keep this between us, that would be great. Definitely no reading in your well-intentioned-but-<em>way-</em>too-action-oriented wife.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I think we can both agree that that’s a bad idea,” Ben agreed.</p><p> </p><p>“Fantastic. Because I think she’s coming back.” Jen had already put on her too-bright smile and was looking at something over Ben’s shoulder. Ben whirled around, and sure enough, there was his wife. “You still owe me those magic bullets,” Jen said through her smile just before Leslie was within hearing range.</p><p> </p><p><em>Okay, Ben, be cool, be cool, </em>he told himself in a quick pep talk before Leslie sat back down with a, “So, what’d I miss?”  </p>

<p>As a rule, Jen didn’t mess around with messy people. Her time was too valuable for that. So, naturally, she had a few questions for April before she could in good conscience have any more sex with her than she already had.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she said. “So when you say you’re not married anymore, how recent is that?”</p><p> </p><p>April was currently sprawled face down across Jen’s rumpled thousand-thread count sheets, back heaving from her last orgasm. She groaned and didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you serious?” she said, muffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Not sure if you’ve figured this out about me, but I don’t really joke,” Jen said, unapologetic. “Don’t get me wrong – I like you, a lot, and this has been <em>really </em>great, but I also don’t really want to get in the middle of messy feelings you have about your ex.”</p><p> </p><p>Buried in there, Jen knew, was the clear implication that she wanted to do this again, and probably again after that. Or, hell, until it stopped being good. Most things did have that expiration date. Jen was usually good at reading the fine print, but April was proving to be an obfuscating agent here.</p><p> </p><p>“Two months, officially,” April finally said. “But we’ve been separated for about a year.” She turned her face in Jen’s direction. Through her hair, her expression was tense. “Is that a problem?”</p><p> </p><p>Well, it obviously wasn’t ideal. Jen didn’t say so, but April wasn’t stupid. She rolled her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to promise not to fall in love with you or something?”</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Jen said. “This isn’t <em>Pretty Woman.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” April said, apparently nonplussed, though Jen didn’t know how much of it she bought. She sat up, the movement revealing her flushed chest and tits, which Jen’s eyes immediately dropped to look at. “Well, then how about I just fuck you again?”</p><p> </p><p>Finally, a reasonable suggestion. Her hands were already sliding up Jen’s chest, palming a breast each. And Jen had never been ashamed of being a hedonist. She let her head tilt back slightly, her mouth fall open. April immediately took advantage, pressing her lips to Jen’s and her tongue into Jen’s mouth so that an involuntary noise in Jen’s throat gave away just how her body was humming.</p><p> </p><p>And oh, what the hell. It wasn’t like she was planning on <em>dating </em>this woman. Jen should probably get confirmation about this, but it also didn’t seem like April was looking for anything more than amazing sex with a hot, confident woman she already knew and felt comfortable with as a response to the end of her marriage making her sad.</p><p> </p><p>And the sex had been surprisingly good so far – which was saying something, because Jen had preemptively been setting her expectations pretty high.</p><p> </p><p>“Less asking,” Jen advised on a breathless moan. “More doing.”</p><p> </p><p>April rolled her eyes again, probably because two of her fingers were already inside of her. Anyway, she obliged, and Jen came quickly and easily, and in the post-coital aftermath of her – fifth? sixth? who was counting anymore – orgasm she had the fleeting wish that she hadn’t given up cigarettes during the last Bush presidency.</p><p> </p><p>April was looking down at her, though, silent and appraising, and Jen’s afterglow soured just a little bit.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” she said.</p><p> </p><p>It was enough to snap April out of whatever funk she’d gotten herself into. She raised her hand and pressed her come-coated fingers against Jen’s lips with a testing pressure. Jen raised her eyebrows and accepted her fingers in her mouth. She loved the taste of herself as much as she loved blowing a woman’s fingers, and April was taking the opportunity to feel around her cheeks and gumline like someone hunting for treasure. The pads of her index finger lingered on one of her canines, and then the other. Jen indulged whatever that was about, then grabbed April’s wrist and tongued above the first knuckle until she’d suckled the indent away. And then a little more, just for fun.</p><p> </p><p>April’s eyes were black and her mouth was open when Jen let go of her fingers with a pop.</p><p> </p><p>“My turn to ask a question,” she said abruptly, which, to be totally honest, was <em>not </em>what Jen had wanted to hear her say.</p><p> </p><p>Still, fair was fair. “Okay,” she said. And because fair might be fair but she knew how to toe the line of playing dirty, she palmed April’s thigh and let her thumb close into the crease between cunt and inner thigh. Just a suggestion. She smiled. “Ask away.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you into me?”</p><p> </p><p>That was… not what she was expecting. A little disappointing, if Jen’s being honest. “You’ve never really struck me as somebody who needs reassurance from her sexual partners.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I’m asking,” April said, but her frustration seemed to be more with herself than with Jen. Jen raised an eyebrow, and invitation to continue. “You saw me in a coffee shop in Pawnee and you wanted to talk to me. You took me out for drinks when I was some no-name intern tagging along with Ben. You took it personally when you guessed that I didn’t want kids; you talked to me, you invited me to your home, you coached me through what I was trying not to feel.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, when she put it like <em>that. </em>“So what’s the question?” Jen said.</p><p> </p><p>“The question is <em>why?” </em>April said again. “Like, did I just get under your skin somehow, and that’s what this is? Or…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen said bluntly. “You were <em>interesting, </em>which is something I didn’t find a lot in your hometown, by the way. Sorry not sorry. You’re sexy, you’re weird as fuck, sure. But you’re also <em>surprising</em>. Not many people can surprise me. And, most of all, you were interested in me too. Don’t think I’ve forgotten who approached who, here.” April did her the favor of not trying to fight her on this one, and simply stared back at her, silent, knowing fingers trailing over Jen’s hip before digging in just enough.</p><p> </p><p>“What else do you want me to say? That I liked the power imbalance?” Jen continued. “Because I did. And I do. Partly because I know there’s something under your skin just itching to turn the tables on me, and I’m <em>deeply</em> curious about when that’s going to happen.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so sure it will?” April challenged, eyes dark and inscrutable.</p><p> </p><p>“As I hope we’ve established by now, I’m not stupid,” Jen said, rolling her eyes. “Maybe you weren’t going to do anything about it until recently, but you’ve wanted me on my knees for you from the first time you walked up to me.”</p><p> </p><p>April didn’t deny this either. “I want a lot of things,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Jen replied. “So what are you gonna do about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Silence. The air turned electric, Jen’s heart beat faster with the charge of it, with the anticipation. It was worth it. April moved suddenly with her decision, taking a handful of Jen’s hair as she climbed on top of her. Jen flipped them handily, laughing as she did so, the burning in her scalp turning her on even more. April fought her until she was on top again and sitting on Jen’s heaving chest, leaving a wet imprint of her cunt smeared messily on Jen’s breasts. She regained her hold of a fistful of Jen’s hair and used it as leverage to twist Jen’s face up to meet hers, panting with the exertion of it.</p><p> </p><p>“You drive me crazy,” she told Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Jen wasn’t fooled by the frustration in her tone and only grinned, electric and superreal with wanting. <em>God </em>she loved sex, she <em>loved </em>sex with someone else who loved sex like she did. “Really? Because I keep asking you what you’re gonna do about it, and – “</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my <em>god,” </em>April said, rolling her eyes, but in fact, she <em>did </em>do something about it in the form of letting go of Jen’s hair to push her down so that she was fully flat on her back, and – fuck, even better – climbing even higher over Jen’s body and hovering directly over her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, wait,” Jen said, and fumbled around for a pillow, and at April’s impatience, she said, “Oh, I’m sorry, did you want me to get a crick in my neck?”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus fuck, eat me already.”</p><p> </p><p>And gladly, Jen did.</p>

<p>The real question you may be asking yourself at this point: when exactly did Jen know she was in trouble, here?</p><p> </p><p>A fine question, and one Jen had been asking herself since well before April decided to walk away from her on a busy D.C. sidewalk at the sunny start of what by all accounts <em>should </em>have been a beautiful holiday weekend in May.</p><p> </p><p>In case you’re wondering, Jen had in fact pinpointed the answer sometime before that particular event to a lazy, exhausted afternoon three months before, and in particular, to a moment where her normally sharp brain was more useless than cold oatmeal mush than a cranky two-year-old was refusing to eat, and April was laying between her legs and saying, “I want to eat you out.”</p><p> </p><p>And sure, Jen would agree with you that some context might help here. The night before, she’d been on a flight from LAX that she sure as shit hadn’t booked as a redeye, but after no less than <em>five </em>delays and <em>three </em>gate changes, she had finally arrived in the District of Columbia at nearly three in the morning. And because she’d planned on being home by 10pm with three hours of time difference burning in her bloodstream, she’d said “hell yes” when April had floated the idea of waiting for her at her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>Jen discovered that April had stayed when she walked through the door at almost 4am. In fact, April was actually sitting up in her living room with a light on, quietly reading the same book Jen had been watching her make her way through for the last week.</p><p> </p><p>Jen herself had been both tired and wired: an unpleasant combination. April had spotted it within thirty seconds, and by the time Jen had scarfed down some of the food April had ordered earlier and come out of the shower with zero intentions of even trying to sleep, April had sourced Jen’s strap from her bedside drawer and put it on.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, someone's eager," Jen had said, smirking as she towel dried her hair while April watched with interested eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I usually am,” April had replied, stroking it lazily with a fist. “If you’re game?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen was rarely <em>not </em>game. And getting fucked until her body chilled out sounded great, actually. But she’d hesitated a little too long, and April had noticed and turned serious as she’d crossed the distance between them. “We don’t have to,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s not that,” Jen had dismissed and pressed bluntly forward as she tossed aside the towel and shook back her hair. “It’s just that I’m probably not gonna be able to come.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not a problem for me if it’s not a problem for you.” April traced the path that a drop of water had just taken down Jen’s cheek from her hairline. Then, the devastating blow: “You don’t have to be the one who always makes it good, you know. Why don’t you just… let me?”</p><p> </p><p>And this was how Jen had ended up in her hands and knees, being fucked from behind. She’d clasped her forearms in front of her and let her head fall into their cradle, slumped, warm and wet all over, a mess being fucked into more of a mess.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not trying to come, right?” April’s voice drifted to her through the haze she’d successfully fucked Jen into.</p><p> </p><p>“No.” The word had come out on a low moan.</p><p> </p><p>“Good. You can come if you want, but don’t try. Just let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen was deep enough in it that she’d obeyed without question – “You’re doing so good,” April praised her; and “You look so fucking good like this for me” – and April had kept her suspended in overstimulation until she made the call that it was enough, slowed to a stop, still buried deep in Jen’s cunt, and let her clench and moan around her own fucking strap until she’d calmed down.</p><p> </p><p>In the morning, Jen had woken up to sunlight slanting through her venetian blinds and a warm, soft, dangerously familiar body between her legs. One of her calves instinctively drew itself upward to feel more of that skin against hers while a hand pressed itself into and curved around her thigh. Jen opened her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna eat you out,” April said.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was too tired, too wanting, too wet with the orgasms she hadn’t had the night before. Maybe it was a mistake, but who could have known it at the time? Not Jen. Not when the world was like syrup. Not when there was a warm mouth that was a literal breath away from her pussy, just waiting for her permission to take it. How could anyone blame Jen in that moment for simply spreading her legs in invitation?</p><p> </p><p>And April hadn’t played with her. There were no games. Just April licking through her cunt, just April taking her clit between her lips. Jen came within a minute, back bowed, legs spread wide, and clutching April’s head with both hands, thinking about how this, this, this was what she’d wanted all along, the soft morning light and the haze of sleep fucking obliterated by the rush of endorphins and pleasure flooding her system faster than her brain could keep up with yet.</p><p> </p><p>That stupid fucking past version of her was in <em>so </em>much trouble, Jen had thought both venomously and uncharitably approximately a million times since then. And all past-Jen was gonna do about it was let April lap up the come from her inner thighs and suck on her tit until they both fell asleep about it.</p><p> </p><p>What a fucking idiot.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>April would love to say that she didn’t let herself get talked into doing stupid shit, but that had definitely been a pattern in her life since she was, oh, nineteen. Especially when it was Leslie Knope doing the asking.</p><p> </p><p>Like, fuck! Could April someday be immune to the emotional machinations of <em>one</em> too-earnest too-blonde middle-aged employee of the federal government from Pawnee, Indiana who she’d worked for for over a decade? Just one. April was feeling generous and would let the universe pick.</p><p> </p><p>That day was not today, and it sure hadn’t been three weeks ago when Leslie had texted her and then left her a voice note and <em>then </em>called (all within the span of three minutes) to ask her to come to Pawnee over Labor Day weekend (“It may be our last summer in Pawnee!”) and then follow that up with four possible itineraries based on twelve different flight combinations April might take from D.C., sorted by date and price.</p><p> </p><p>Inevitably, April had picked one of them and made arrangements with Leslie, her parents, her sister, and, after taking a deep breath about it, Andy. Even more inevitably once she’d arrived, Leslie had asked her to come by Ben’s local campaign headquarters to “smell the engines of democracy hard at work.”</p><p> </p><p>“I live in Washington, D.C.,” April had told her. “Also, I worked on your campaign. I know what democracy smells like.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dreams, freedom, and paper coming hot off the printer,” Leslie had said dreamily.</p><p> </p><p>“Money and the desperation of a lot of entitled white men clinging to power,” April had replied. “90 percent humidity optional.”</p><p> </p><p>But she’d been effectively overruled by Leslie’s simultaneous disappointment in her response (“April.” “What? I’m not wrong.”) and enthusiasm for Ben’s campaign, and allowed herself to be driven into Wyatt 2018 Pawnee campaign HQ, where they were met with a weirder-than-usual Ben.</p><p> </p><p>“April!” he’d said with a voice about half an octave higher than normal. “Hi! Hello! Um, I didn’t know you were coming by today?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m here for the sweet, sweet smell of democracy,” she said. “So take me to your hellpit so I can get a good waft of fear, sweat, and sulfur.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha ha ha!” said Ben. April tilted her head and furrowed her eyebrows in question. In <em>dude, what the fuck? </em>question, to be specific. Ben ignored this question in favor of turning to Leslie, who was coming in through the door. “Leslie, hi, babe! You brought April today! I thought you were bringing her tomorrow?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I <em>was, </em>but then I thought, why put off to tomorrow what you can do today, and <em>then </em>I thought, well, why not bring her today <em>and </em>tomorrow? Also oooh, another thought is coming to me – April, we can go canvassing! You love canvassing!”</p><p> </p><p>At Ben’s look, she deadpanned for his benefit, “I love canvassing.”</p><p> </p><p>April actually had never minded doing canvassing while at Parks and missed it. Looking into people’s houses and seeing how weird they were? Bullying them in progressively weirder but Leslie-sanctioned ways to do whatever she was trying to get them to do? Honestly, she’d never felt closer to Leslie than when they were bullying people together.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, cool!” he said, still? increasingly weird? “Maybe you should get started on that, like, right now! Sidney can get you set up with what you need, if you just wanna come around this way – “</p><p> </p><p>“Ben, why are you being so weird?” April interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Leslie said. “I didn’t wanna say anything, but she’s right, babe, you’re being a little weird. What’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing!” he said, and then with a double thumbs-up: “Canvassing: yay!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not moving until you tell me why you’re being so weird,” April said. “Tell me why you’re being weird.”</p><p> </p><p>“April.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, can we just – “</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me!”</p><p> </p><p>The universe decided to tell April for him in that moment, but April would only realize that about half a day after the fact, because for the moment she was completely preoccupied with the fact of Jen Barkley walking into the room, half-distracted and typing on her phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Ben, I – “ Jen was saying, then cut herself off and stopped both walking and typing when she caught sight of the three people assembled before her.</p><p> </p><p>It could have been awkward. April froze like a rabbit while Jen’s gaze swept over her… and then moved on to Leslie.</p><p> </p><p>“Leslie!” she said, relentless enthusiasm on full display. “Always so full of that hands-on energy that <em>literally</em> can’t be stopped! What brings you down to HQ this afternoon? Remember what I said about the smarties!”</p><p> </p><p>They both laughed in a way that had April raising her eyebrows and looking to Ben, who was suddenly the person acting most normally in the room. He grimaced in an <em>I know, it’s fine </em>kind of way.  </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Jen! But it’s funny you should ask,” Leslie said back with the same kind of smile, and then – oh no. oh no. – turned to April. “One of my very favorite people in the world is in town this weekend and we happened to get bitten by the old canvassing bug! Actually, wait,” Leslie said. April tried to push down the terror that <em>she knows, she knows, I don’t know how but she figured it out, </em>but all Leslie said with a renewed smile was, “Have you ever officially met April? April Ludgate, Jen Barkley; Jen, April. Each of you please meet one of the most fantastic, incredible, beautiful women in the entire world. I’m sure you’ll get along like a house on fire.” Her expression turned appraising as it looked between them again. “Maybe literally. Hmm. Anyway! We’ll get out of your hair and go talk to Sidney.”</p><p> </p><p>Weird how ten seconds in Leslie’s presence could make her feel like she was an awkward teenager who hadn’t figured anything about her life out yet. The old instinct to flee and hide was coming up again the longer she was fidgeting between Leslie and Jen – and Ben, too, she guessed, because he was acting weirder than ever.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, she had to get out of here.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, Leslie, I’m not feeling super great,” she said, pointing her thumb vaguely behind her generally in the direction of outside. “I’m just gonna go. Grab some air. Or something.”</p><p> </p><p>Leslie’s expression immediately fell. “Oh, no,” she said with dismay that immediately turned concerned. “Do you need me to go to CVS?” She pressed a hand to April’s forehead. “You don’t feel feverish. Should I go pick you up some soup? Actually, no, let me make a call and we’ll get you to the top of the line at urgent care – “</p><p> </p><p><em>“God,”</em> April said in horror as she slapped one of Leslie’s hands away from her face and knocked the other one away from the phone Leslie was reaching for. Without meaning to, her eyes flickered over to Jen: arms crossed, eyebrows raised, looking way too fucking amused for April’s comfort. “I’m just gonna go outside.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, April!” Leslie’s contrite voice called after her. “I’ll check on you in ten minutes!”</p><p> </p><p>What a fucking nightmare.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>At least it wasn’t like April hadn’t seen Jen at all since she’d flipped out on her right before Memorial Day. Talk about a fucking nightmare. She’d wallowed in indecision and self-loathing and toyed with the idea of calling Andy just to hear the voice of someone who loved her unequivocably and – why not? – punish herself a little more while she was at it. Jen had called her phone almost every time she’d thought about it (April picked up exactly never times) and April could accept a sign from the universe for what it was.</p><p> </p><p>It was late June by the time she’d gotten her shit together enough to brave the drive over to Jen’s place and ring her doorbell on a Saturday evening. It was a longshot that Jen would even be there; who even knew what the patterns of her life were now that April wasn’t in it? April had almost talked herself into leaving when Jen had abruptly opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry I read things that weren’t there,” April got out in a rush before she chickened out. “I’m a mess. You were right from the start. It wasn’t fair to you and I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at her with one hand still on the doorknob. She didn’t say anything for long enough that April was starting to have nightmare visions of what was going on behind her – somebody else she’d moved on to having sex with now that April had been too in her head to text her back for three weeks; maybe even a whole fucking orgy; who knew! Anything was possible when it came to Jen, who April had maybe never really known at all.</p><p> </p><p>“I can go…” April offered into the silence, uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>“Christ. You’re so <em>young</em>,” Jen muttered and turned around. “Well?” she called as she walked back inside. April blinked from where she was standing at the open front door. “Are you coming inside or not?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not mad?” April asked as she followed Jen inside the house, looking around tentatively like it was her first time here – like Jen was still an unknown entity, some ridiculously powerful, charismatically sexy almost-stranger who was about to change the course of her entire life.</p><p> </p><p>Jen, who was at this point <em>not </em>a stranger, laughed and turned around. “Of course I’m mad,” she said with a smile and an even voice and hard, dangerous eyes. “Do you think I’m used to being dumped? Or <em>ghosted?” </em></p><p> </p><p>April, trying very hard to remove any lingering vestiges of sarcasm from her voice, said “No?” as normally as possible.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No, </em>because I never put myself in a situation where that’s possible,” Jen said. “So this is an inglorious first for me, and I’m pretty fucking furious about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m here now,” April said. “And I’m sorry. Really. What can I do? What do you want?” </p><p> </p><p>Jen looked at her for a long moment, then stalked slowly towards her. April’s back straightened unconsciously.</p><p> </p><p>“I <em>want</em>,” Jen told her deliberately, “you to treat me like what I’m worth. What do you think? Can you do that?”</p><p> </p><p>It was condescending, and also hot as fuck. April, knowing she absolutely could not afford to misread this situation, said, “Yes. Will you tell me how?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the one that keeps telling me we’re broken up,” Jen said, and then kissed, then <em>bit, </em>her upper lip. April’s breath hitched. “You tell me.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>April went back inside before Leslie had a chance to carry out the threat of checking on her, and/or anything else. There were a few staffers scurrying around the open floor plan of the first room, which April quickly bypassed before anybody asked her who she was and what she was doing there. Pretty yikes on the security front, Ben, but it meant she made it back to the room she’d run out of roughly five minutes ago without having to answer any questions.</p><p> </p><p>She braced herself before stepping inside – but the only person there was Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” April said quietly, hands in her pockets.</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked over slowly, a sly grin forming on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>This was <em>so </em>much better than anything April had been anticipating. “Don’t,” she warned anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I’ve always been curious,” Jen teased.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, shut up,” April said, rolling her eyes against her embarrassment. “Where is Leslie, anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Talking Sidney’s ears off about local strategy,” Jen said carelessly. “Ostensibly getting a bunch of stuff to hand out while canvassing, if you decided to feel better today. Or tomorrow, apparently.” She tilted her head at April, appraising. “I didn’t know you were going to be here.”</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, that was popping up as a common theme. April shoved this irritating thought down. “This is my hometown. I didn’t know <em>you </em>were going to be here,” she returned.</p><p> </p><p>“Would have stayed home if you’d known?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” April said to the challenge. “Just, probably I wouldn’t have run out of here like an idiot a few minutes ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s expression lost its teasing and turned serious. “Look, I don’t want you to be afraid of me. I know things are… weird. Another reason why I don’t really do this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are we still? Doing this?” April asked on a surge of stupid teenage hope.</p><p> </p><p>Jen considered her again for a long moment. April held her breath. Jen’s face was unreadable: a reminder of how much she played the game of politics, and how successful she’d been at building her life around doing so. But then her face shifted like she’d made a decision.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean,” Jen said significantly, before leaning in and lowering her voice. “As I seem to recall, you <em>did </em>have a specific fantasy about the two of us in Pawnee. And it’s okay if that was just the sex talking, but if you wanted to, you know. I’d be up for that.” She shook her hair, straightened her posture. “No strings, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” April repeated.</p><p> </p><p>Jen picked up on the <em>yes </em>that was buried just beneath the tease and sidled forward with a hint of a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” she drawled. April was probably lucky that she didn’t tap her under the chin or let her fingers drag down her throat, Jesus. “That’s a… yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Of course it was a yes. April threw a quick look behind her, but Jen was already grabbing her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Ben’s on a call, Leslie’s still got another ten minutes before Sidney cuts her off, the interns aren’t paid enough to care,” she said. “Come on. I know a place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you <em>know a place.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Do you?” Jen challenged, and to be absolutely fair, April did not. Not within a right-here kind of distance.</p><p> </p><p>Jen dragged her past those same staffers in the front room and into a tiny conference room that had four chairs, a table, and a bookshelf laden with files and stacks of papers and littered with various paraphernalia with Ben’s campaign logo on it.</p><p> </p><p>“No one comes in here,” Jen promised with just that hint of noncomposure that April loved hearing in her voice. She flipped the lock on the door and turned around. “How do you want it?”</p><p> </p><p>Right down to business. She was already unbuttoning her blouse. April caught her hands and stopped them.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not about how I want it,” April said. “Besides, I seem to remember you getting off on this as much, if not more, than I was.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah?” Jen said, amused, and also turned on. “Is that how it’s gonna be?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” April said. “Actually, yeah. Turn around. Hands on the table.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a tense moment where April wasn’t sure if Jen would do it. She wasn’t about to flinch <em>now, </em>but Jen still played this game better than she did. Five seconds ticked away, loud in April’s ear, and then…</p><p> </p><p>Not quite relief, but just as much of a heady rush, when Jen slowly turned, and even more slowly bent at the waist over the table. April breathed deeply at the sight of Jen’s fingers splaying decisively over the surface. And then she stilled.</p><p> </p><p>April moved closer, enough to tease Jen with the presence and weight of her body without actually touching her. Jen didn’t say anything, and the silence between them turned electric. April swore to god it would crackle the moment she laid so much as a fucking finger on Jen’s body.</p><p> </p><p>One finger extended along the length of Jen’s thigh. She could hear the breath Jen sucked in at the anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>“I missed this,” April blurted out without really meaning to.</p><p> </p><p>“You missed… me bent over for you?”</p><p> </p><p>Sure. That was true. “Yeah,” April said, and then before she could embarrass herself further, she said, “Spread your legs.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re spread as far as I can in this skirt. Unless you wanna help with that?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re resourceful,” April said, unsympathetic. “Figure it out.”</p><p> </p><p>A deep sigh, but Jen got started on squirming against the table strategically to get her pencil skirt to bunch up her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that’s right,” April said. “Get off on it. Keep going.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you can do better degradation than that,” Jen said, a little breathless from her efforts. And probably also from turning herself on. “Don’t start holding back on me now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you like a little warm up,” April tossed back at her. “Unless you want me to throw you right in the deep end, see if you swim?”</p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck do you think I am?” Jen demanded, but her squirming was becoming increasingly uncoordinated. God, April was tempted to just let her go, see if she’d hump herself to orgasm right here on the table without April touching her at all. She was lucky that April’s hands were itching to touch her so badly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” April said innocently. “So then you’d like it if I just – “</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed the hem of Jen’s skirt and pulled it up roughly just below her ass. Jen gasped, laughed, and spread her legs far enough that April couldn’t have any complaints.</p><p> </p><p>“Whaddyou want me to say?” she asked. “Thank you, daddy?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh my god. One of April’s hands went to Jen’s head and pushed it down onto the table, holding her face sideways, and Jen gave an encore performance of her gasp-laugh-legs spread ditty – one that got cut off when April’s other hand pulled down her underwear and teased her clit.</p><p> </p><p>“My name works just fine,” April said while she scissored her clit, one, two, three times. “Use it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, April,” Jen said, but this time there was no teasing in her voice. “Oh god. Put your fingers inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>“So fast?” April mocked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Jen gasped. “April. April.”</p><p> </p><p>That more than anything was making April feel frankly a little insane, and she contorted her hand to press her thumb into Jen while her fingers kept moving on her clit. Jen’s cunt was hot and wet where the lengths of April’s fingers slipped between her labia, and it drove April even further into insanity with the need to cup her whole, to squeeze, and feel the degree to which she was <em>hers. </em>She did, and Jen’s fingers curled into nothing on the unforgiving surface of the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh god,” she said again. “April, don’t you <em>dare</em> drag this out.”</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t about to make any promises. “You want some of that degradation now?” she asked. Without waiting for an answer, she said, “You horny slut. Letting me fuck you face down on a table with your candidate right outside.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuuuuuck,” Jen moaned quietly but with enormous feeling.</p><p> </p><p>April drew back, slid two fingers inside her, earned another quiet moan. “Two fingers on your clit,” she ordered.</p><p> </p><p>Jen did as she was told, which never failed to send a little thrill through April. One that was amplified when:</p><p> </p><p>“Jen?” Ben’s voice called. “Is that you in there?”</p><p> </p><p>They both froze – but only briefly.</p><p> </p><p>“Better answer him,” April whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, just me,” Jen called back. Her voice was too practiced, too steady. April’s eyes narrowed and she fucked a third finger into her. Jen was wet but still a little tight, a little unprepared, but April knew the pain and the challenge would just turn her on faster. And oh, look at that – brand new slick, just for her. Reward, punishment, April didn’t know the impetus, didn’t care, but she contorted her wrist and fucked <em>hard. </em>Jen’s body arched backwards into April’s hips, but as usual, nothing escaped her throat without her say so.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, great!” Ben called back, confused. The doorknob rattled against the lock. “Can you… let me in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Gonna let him hear?” April taunted, directly in her ear. “Come on, Jen, that’s what this was about, right? Yeah, you can talk a big game about being my mommy, but when it comes down to it, you just wanna make sure everybody knows how big of a fucking <em>slut </em>you are for me, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is someone in there with you?” Ben’s voice came again from outside. “You’re not discussing last minute strategy without me, are you?”</p><p> </p><p><em>No, Ben, </em>April wanted to call back. <em>It’s just that she’s about thirty seconds away from coming.</em></p><p> </p><p>“What do you think, Jen? Is someone in here with you?” April taunted her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was almost past the point of being able to manage words, and horny slut or not, she <em>was </em>a serious and powerful professional, and she kept her mouth firmly shut. April wasn’t fooled, though, not with how much wetter Jen was getting between her legs, not with April’s right hand firmly entrenched there and working deliriously with it, <em>in </em>it.</p><p> </p><p>April’s left hand twisted in Jen’s hair, pushed her head against the table, earned a minute strangled sound deep in Jen’s throat. Good, good, <em>fuck</em> yes.</p><p> </p><p>“Rub your pathetic little clit harder,” April breathed in her ear. “And then fucking come the way you’ve been dying to since you saw me across the room.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s free hand, still obediently on the table, clawed into the surface as a low, unmistakable moan shuddered out of her. God, April loved when Jen came. And she fucking <em>missed </em>the high of being the one to make her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” said Ben’s scandalized voice. “Okay. I’m gonna go. Immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>This sent Jen, the <em>freak, </em>hurtling into a second orgasm. She wasn’t even finished with the first one. April laughed, delighted, now that they didn’t have an audience anymore. Jen moaned that moan she let out when she was totally satisfied, and April kept laughing, loving the way the two sounds mixed together.</p><p> </p><p>Silence overtook them for a minute or two afterward, which was unusual, even with the whole Ben overhearing them thing. Maybe even especially with the Ben overhearing them thing. April didn’t mind quiet, but Jen was a hurricane, in constant, self-sustaining motion like she’d fall apart completely without it. April had gotten used to the way she’d leap up after rounds of sex that wiped April out but only seemed to energize Jen into whatever the next thing was.  </p><p> </p><p>“Soooo…” April said. Jen was busily straightening up, pulling her skirt down, checking her hair and makeup in her phone camera. Not that April had even gotten to kiss her, she realized with a pang of… fear? Regret? Her makeup was still perfect, was the point. Jen’s eyes met April’s as she put down her phone.</p><p> </p><p>“You have an end to that sentence or am I supposed to guess?” she drawled.</p><p> </p><p>April pushed down a stab of something she could <em>definitely </em>label as irritation. “I was gonna ask how long you’re here for.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m heading out tomorrow,” Jen said as she idly tousled her hair back to perfection even without a mirror. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>April scoffed a laugh, but her heart was already sinking. “I mean, I feel like it’s pretty obvious why I’m asking.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s not,” said Jen. “Do you wanna have more kinky and/or mindblowing sex, or do you wanna show me around your hometown? Introduce me to your friends? Your family?” She paused. “Your ex?”</p><p> </p><p>Stung, April cringed back. “Not my ex, but… would any of the rest of that really be so bad?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you know it would, April,” Jen said, and was that fucking <em>pity </em>in her voice? April’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t make this something you know it can’t be. You don’t wanna play house only to have it all fall apart again any more than I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“You wanna get married,” Jen said, and over April’s scoff, she continued, “You wanna fall in love. You want to move in with somebody and share a set of utensils.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have no idea what I want.”</p><p> </p><p>“And neither do you,” Jen replied, exasperated.</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make it better!” April snapped. “You’ve made up a lot of stories about what you think I’m looking for, and you’re not looking for any fucking input from the one person who might actually be able to give you something accurate to work with!”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Jen agreed. “But pardon me for clocking the fact that your input isn’t necessarily reliable yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, fuck you for not even bothering to try.”</p><p> </p><p>“My <em>point</em> is,” Jen barreled relentlessly onward, “that it was clear that it wasn’t ever gonna be me. I’m trying to save you from your own expectations here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me?” Jen said after a moment, eyebrows raised.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Bullshit,” </em>April repeated. “You said that you <em>did </em>have feelings for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I did,” Jen agreed, and after a pause, added, “I do. I don’t know what you think that proves, though.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not trying to prove anything,” April said. “Just – if I was so different, how can you say that you know what <em>you </em>want? Sounds like you’re the one who’s scared, actually. Like you got a taste of something you didn’t think you’d like and you freaked about what it meant.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Jen agreed easily. “Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>April paused. “Maybe?” she echoed.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe all the reasons I don’t do this shit also just got reinforced when I got left standing on a street like an idiot. Not one of the highlights of my year, if we’re being honest.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” April said, and meant it just as much as she had the last few times she’d said it and thought – stupidly, apparently – that Jen had heard her. “I really am. I know I haven’t given you a reason to think I actually know what I’m about. Just – tell me what I can do to fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>But Jen didn’t reply. She did look at April for a long moment, like she was putting her under her scope, like she was part of a conundrum she’d been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to solve, like there was a path forward but she needed to move first in order to find it.</p><p> </p><p>April wasn’t surprised when she pushed off the desk and stepped closer, but she <em>was </em>surprised when she leaned in and kissed her. April, trying not to spook her off of whatever was happening here, mostly kept her hands to herself and let Jen do what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll call you when you’re back in D.C.,” she murmured. Then she flipped the lock on the door, opened it, and disappeared without looking back.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Leslie had left with April about ten minutes after Jen had left her in the conference room. Neither of them had tried to say goodbye to Jen – she could probably say thanks to Ben for that, if she was willing to indulge any of Ben’s well-meaning and <em>extremely </em>unsubtle attempts to catch her eye that had been happening for the last hour. Jen would be honest: she’d liked the first hour post-coitus interruptus-gate when he’d refused to look her in the eye <em>way </em>more.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to leave the office around 4:30 – “tried” being the key word, because her path was intercepted just as she reached the door, having called a cheery “goodbye” to the staff at large on her way out. Rookie mistake.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>Because it was Ben, with a worried expression on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, calm down, Ben,” she dismissed, not needing to hear anything he had to say to know what was going to come out of his mouth. “Even if anything like what you’re afraid of was actually happening, we’re both big girls.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not afraid of anything,” Ben lied, and then followed up this whopper with a sincere, “Just… be careful.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your girl will be fine,” Jen said with a roll of her eyes and a step forward.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not just April I’m worried about,” Ben said as he caught her arm gently, and then, just as gently, let her go.</p><p> </p><p>Rather than call him out as the liar he’d just proven himself to be, Jen found herself uncharacteristically without words, staring dumbly at him with an open-mouthed smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Take care, Jen,” Ben told her, guided her out the door, and shut it after her.</p>
