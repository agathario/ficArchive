<strong>July 2022</strong>
</p><p>Rio Vidal’s chest still hammered punishingly against her ribcage when she buckled her seatbelt with shaky hands. She reclined her head back on the seat, breathing deeply for the first time in hours, her mind finally clearing and allowing her to really think about her decisions. When she did, the weight of it made her want to scream and run away, punch against the plane doors and cry hysterically until a steward let her go.</p><p>Rio felt like suing everyone who ever said that an intimate trip was just what a dysfunctional couple needed to get back on track. Well, it wasn't exactly intimate, was it? Not when Natasha decided to invite her college friend and now business partner Vis and his wife Wanda to tag along with them to Sicily. Taking the trip more like a celebration of their success more than a chance to reconnect with her neglected wife who was by her side every step of the way. Rio considered herself lucky that the couple didn't consider taking their twins to the trip.</p><p>She tried to enjoy it, she really did. Impossible mission. They were obnoxious and Rio could feel how fake they were with all their lovey-dovey, their perfect facade of a couple who never disagreed on something. It would make Rio jealous compared with how her own relationship with Natasha currently was if she didn't see right through them. </p><p>But it made her constantly feel that she wasn't a good enough wife, especially when they brought up the childrens topic and Rio said that she and Natasha didn't want any because planet Earth was less than 50 years away from destruction. Even worse when Natasha acted like it was still an open subject, like they hadn't gone through the very same conversation a million times. </p><p>The final blow came right in that morning on a trip to the beach with just the women because Vis was too busy wanting to pilot a jet ski, Rio went back to the her room to fetch her sun hat and when she came down again Natasha and Wanda were nowhere to be seen and didn't respond to her calls. </p><p>She then remembered how Wanda kept talking about wanting to visit a small den on the far side of the beach and Rio walked there, just to find Natasha full on making out with her friend's wife. </p><p>Neither of them seemed to notice Rio, so she just kept herself collected going back to their hotel room. She sat on the bed and stared at the wall, rewinding the scene on her head and waiting for that fatal pang of hurt, anger, sadness and heartbreak all at once. It didn't came.</p><p>Deep inside she longed for those bad feelings, because they meant that she still loved her wife and those years she tried to put in an effort for their marriage to work weren't in vain. The truth is, it had been long since they were a proper couple. She loved Natasha, sure, the way you love someone you grew accustomed to. But the little things that Nat said that disregarded her or made her feel inferior now that the redhead was a bigshot businesswoman didn't pass by unnoticed,on top of that, the sex had been nonexistent for months.</p><p>It was simple; They weren't attracted to each other anymore. Living like a pair of old people who kept their marriage because it was already too late in life to divorce.</p><p>Even if Rio was already pushing forty, she felt too young to be this old.</p><p>Missing that carefree young attitude that got lost during law school was what pushed Rio to pack her bags and look for the next flight to somewhere distant from Sicily, she wanted to be out of there before lunchtime. </p><p>Embarking on the next boat to the city, surfing on an adrenaline high that only doing something completely insane provides, only to get at the airport and have no idea on what to do next. Money wasn't the problem, she just didn't know what to do. </p><p>Well, it couldn't get worse anyway. So Rio confidently strutted to the nearest desk and asked. “What is your next available flight? Like, right now?”</p><p>That's how she ended up on a high class plane to Athens, Greece. </p><p>Night has already fallen when the plane landed, waking her up from her nap. She kept seated, trying to calculate what to do next as a pang of loneliness crept in on her chest. Why couldn't Natasha just be honest? Why couldn't she be honest and tell Natasha that she was unhappy? What would she do now?</p><p>“Ma’am, everything okay?” A stewardess asked her, waking Rio up from her daydreams and realizing that the plane was almost empty.</p><p>“Huh, yes, sorry.” She chuckled awkwardly. “Hey, where do you all…plane people…go when you land?”</p><p>The woman gave her a nice smile. “Well, usually we are directed for the same hotel or, depending on when the next flight is, we can choose our own destination.” </p><p>“Where are you going now?” Rio asked in an almost desperation for some guidance.</p><p>She found Rio’s attitude to be strange and wasn't unaccustomed to dealing with weirdos, but she genuinely looked like a lost lady. “We’re staying here in Athens, but if you would like a recommendation, I've been with the crew on the lovely island of Mykonos. Maybe you would like it.”</p><p>“Great, thanks!” Rio took her hand bag in a hurry, afraid that if she stopped to think for a moment she would give up and go back.</p><p>The only thing the woman failed to inform is that the island was three hours away by ferry, and Rio spent those hours very miserably tucked into a corner watching the happy families and couples, exhausted by the trip and ignoring all of Natasha calls, making a very pointed effort to decline them and make known that she was being purposefully mistreated.</p><p>Rio managed to find the best hotel she could in a hurry, trying to remain in the unbothered attitude. When she got in the room, Rio just tossed her luggage on the floor and took a long shower, too tired to even dress herself before going to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>                                _________</p><p> </p><p>When she woke up the next morning, the post-sleep clarity hit her. Rio rubbed her face and stared into the nothing, deciding it was too late now to back down. The trip originally was programmed to last seven more days, and she would make the most out of it without Natasha.</p><p>Speaking of the devil, her phone kept blowing up notifications from her desperate soon to be ex-wife.</p><p>She picked up her cellphone, ignoring all the texts where Natasha asked her what had happened, if she was okay, if she needed help, threatening to call the police.</p><p>
<em>I already know about you and Wanda</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don't call me</em>
</p><p>
<em>We’re done</em>
</p><p>Rio knew Natasha wouldn't rest, so she blocked her number and social media profiles.</p><p>She jumped out of bed and looked out of the window to absorb the day view and the bright summer sun, the landscape of the sea along with the white villas somehow managed to ease her heart into a more calm rhythm. She got dressed in a blue set of blouse and shorts along with a white satin bandana around her neck in her best attempt at a mediterranean look. Rio put on her sunglasses and stepped outside on the morning sun, the refreshing breeze blowing her shoulder length hair back as she walked without direction, incorporating her long forgotten spontaneity to find a good place to have breakfast. </p><p>It was a lovely open space with plant ornaments and blue tiles, she enjoyed her portion of omelet with avocado toast and a cup of coffee while watching the back and forth of tourists and boats, realizing how this complete silent wasn't much different from having a meal with Natasha, who mostly spent it on her phone or, during the trip, talking to Vis and Wanda.</p><p>Then Rio took a walk on the beach and sat by the rocks, hugging her own knees and really taking the time to think about her life. She was an forty year old accomplished employment lawyer, she was intelligent, beautiful and opinionated. How could she let herself go through these situations? How did she put up with Natasha’s cold shoulder for so long? When Rio really thought about it, maybe their relationship had already died months prior this day. Maybe that's why she didn't feel sad. </p><p>Rio had spent long months focused on helping and supporting Natasha, and when she finally got time to focus on herself, she realized that perhaps she wasn't someone who wanted to be with her wife anymore. They had been married for eight years at this point and Rio couldn't phantom the idea of having to go back to the dating world, so keeping things as they were was more comfortable.</p><p>When she snapped out of her daydreams the afternoon tide had risen and the cold water soaked her sandal covered feet. Rio closed her eyes at the sensation, she had always loved nature and with time she lost so many of the habits she used to do related to it, switching them for piles and piles of work and Natasha drama. Her garden back at home was abandoned , she didn't used to go on hikes anymore and couldn't remember when was the last time she had sunbathed or offered an incense to the moon. </p><p>Walking to some close café, Rio decided it was time to take up her old habits, the little things in life that made her happy. The first one was going to be a mindless dive in the Aegean sea right after she had a green mango smoothie, which she had abdicated because of how much Natasha made fun of her when she ordered. Rio sat on a table on the outside portion of the café to drink it, next to a few shops and a big white marmor staircase. She pulled out her phone, forgotten in her purse amidst her life crisis, to update her friends, but majorly decided against it. They would have plenty of time to talk about it when she returned to the United States, so Rio just took a picture of her drink and uploaded it on instagram, making sure to tag the place as she was sure that it was going to leave people questioning why she wasn't in Sicily anymore. Or not. Maybe people didn't care about her life as she thought they did.</p><p>When she put away her phone and looked around the street, Rio noticed an old man giving her a look that was nothing short of malicious. She decided to ignore it, unfortunately it wasn't that uncommon in her life. Then, a few meters beyond him, another guy - younger and well dressed - staring directly at her. When Rio noticed, it was impossible to unnotice, a bunch of guys with glued eyes on her, on top of the staircase, tucked on the shops’ windows, it made her feel uncomfortable like never before, a sudden urge to cover herself and get out of there.</p><p>“Incredibly annoying, isn't it?” She heard a husky female voice coming from a table next to her. “You get so erupted in the fantasy, one may think this place is perfect.”</p><p>“Well, it seems that wherever you go, men will be men.” Rio said sarcastically, finally being able to pinpoint where the voice was coming from. Sitting alone two tables on her left, a white woman with long dark brown hair with a few highlights on the tips,crooked nose, wearing big sunglasses, dressed in cream and blue clothes that seemed more warm than recommended for a day like this.  </p><p>“Hi.” The woman greeted, raising a hand and wiggling her fingers in a wave to Rio.</p><p>“How did you know I was american?” </p><p>She shrugged with a smirk. “I had a hunch. I was between that and some place beyond the Latin-American division.”</p><p>“Really?” Rio scoffed, unbelieving. “My mom is from Puerto Rico.”</p><p>“Nice place. I've been there a few years back for work, in Bayamón,have you been there?”</p><p>Although she had completely butchered the pronunciation, Rio nodded at her. “Yeah, I already went once on vacation.”</p><p>Rio usually hated small talk, but she had spent all day only listening to her own voice to order something, it was nice to have a civil conversation with someone. She noticed how they had been speaking in louder voices to reach each other's table and signed for the woman to come to her table, assuming that no one would join her. </p><p>The brown haired woman quickly complied, gathering her things from the table - a book, a magazine, her purse and a glass of what Rio assumes to be white wine at lunchtime - and walking to the other woman's table. She discharged her things on top of it and sat on the chair in front of Rio.</p><p>“Sorry for the mess.” She chuckles awkwardly and pushes her sunglasses to the top of her head, revealing a pair of greenish blue eyes adorned with age marks on the skin around it, contrasting with her sharp cheekbones. She had a mature and beautiful face that literally stunned Rio for a second as she registraded the woman's appearance. “I'm Agatha.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I'm Rio.”</p><p>“Rio? That's such an elegant name.” Agatha said sincerely. “Your mother picked it?”</p><p>“Yes.” She nodded with a smile, not knowing why. “I'm curious, how did your work lead you to Bayamón?” Rio made sure to pronounce it correctly, to tease her lightly. </p><p>Agatha realized it and laughed. She had a pleasant laugh with a little snort at the end. “First of all, I'm sorry about my Spanish, I was never really good at it. Second, maybe I exaggerated a little when I said it was a work trip.”</p><p>Rio shot her eyebrows up, feeling entertained with the easy conversation. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. I had to meet with some investors from the territory and they happened to be at Casa Bacardí. Sorry again about this rendition.” </p><p>“So…your work meeting was a tour to drink rum?” </p><p>“When you put it like that…” Agatha replied in a humorous tone that made them both laugh. “In my defense, men are easier to convince when they are happy, and they’re happier with alcohol.” She took a sip of her wine, as if to make her point.</p><p>“God, I wish i could do that at work.” Rio sighed, playing with the empty smoothie cup. “It would make my life easier.”</p><p>“Really? What do you do?” She asked, putting her elbow on the table and supporting her chin with her hand, looking genuinely interested and not just polite.</p><p>“I'm a lawyer.” Rio said like it was a confession. “Labour law, to be more specific. So i encounter a lot of idiotic men who refuse to throw in the towel and admit that making your employee work for twelve hours without lunch break is wrong.” </p><p> “Hmm, so i think i must be careful with you…” Agatha said with a lower teasing voice, lifting her eyes to meet Rio's, giving her a small smile.</p><p>“Oh, really?” Rio responded in the same tone. “What do you do?” </p><p>“Do you really not recognize me, Rio?” </p><p>Rio took a few seconds to really look at her face, making note of all her features, her thin but full lips, how her ear was covered in piercings, the curve of her nose. It didn't ring any bells except the one that told Rio how attractive this woman was. </p><p>She pursed her lips and shook her head. </p><p>Agatha bit her lips playfully. “Then I won't tell you. I will only say that normally I'm a very nice employee, but approaching deadlines makes everyone a little crazy.” </p><p>She nodded with her head not really giving a damn about Agatha's work ethics, just feeling curious to know more about her. </p><p>“I will let it slide, just because I really need a friend right now.” Rio’s sincerity shocked herself, not being used to open her feelings to people, especially strangers, but maybe her desperation spoke louder this time. </p><p>Agatha tilted her head to the side, inquisitive. “Everything ok?” </p><p>She sighed. “Well, I got cheated on vacation and immediately packed my things, went freestyle and landed here. How’s that for a start?”</p><p>The other woman didn't look that shocked at all. “I guess everyone has their reason. Are you enjoying it at least?” </p><p>Rio went out on a ramble about how her marriage was doomed for a long time before it's fateful end, how she was kind of relieved that it ended even though she had no idea of what would happen once she was back in New York. “And you know what?” She got closer to Agatha, signaling for her to approach so she could speak at a lower level. “On the first day in Sicily, I found her watching porn! I just went down for breakfast, couldn't she wait for me?”</p><p>“Oh. She?” Agatha asked and suddenly Rio felt defensive, picking on her tone.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio answered, surly, moving away from Agatha. “I’m a lesbian. Does that bother you?”</p><p>“No, no!” Agatha exclaimed, touching her arm as a way of comfort. “Sorry if it sounded that way. I wrongly assumed you were married to a man and got surprised. In any case, my mistake.”</p><p>“Hm.” Rio nodded, Agatha sounded sincere and the slight touch of her hand was unbelievably warm. “Marriage is fucking complicated.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Don't i know. At some points me and Ralph can't stand each other and need some time away, like now.”</p><p>Now Rio was the one surprised. Agatha was all alone and a glance towards her hands confirmed the lack of a wedding ring. “You're married?”</p><p>“Have been for fifteen years. I have a big project coming up, so I decided to take some time for myself, away from him. He's at home with our son.”</p><p>“You have a son!?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha smiled, picking her phone up and showing Rio a picture of a smiling boy who couldn't be older than fourteen. “His name is Nicholas.”</p><p>“He 's so cute.” Rio said, handing her phone back.</p><p>“Do you have children?”</p><p>“Oh, no.” Rio nodded vehemently. “I mean, if we didn't lived in a fucked up world i would love to have them, but i’m not brave enough to put a kid in this mess.”</p><p>The conversation easily picked up pace and when Rio realized, the sun was already setting down and her stomach was complaining, her empty smoothie and Agatha's empty glass still on the table after the women spent hours talking as the other customers came and went.</p><p>“I think I should get going.” Rio said checking the time on her phone. “I don't really want to stay out here at night.”</p><p>“Understandable.” Agatha said, grabbing her purse and standing up. “It was really nice to meet you, Rio.”</p><p>“You too, Agatha.” Rio smiled politely and sincerely.</p><p>“Would you like to grab lunch together tomorrow?” She was straightforward. “I mean, we're both all alone in this foreign country, I figured that we could stick together.”</p><p>“Yeah, I would really like that.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, handing her phone to Rio. “Here, put your number.”</p><p>Rio typed her phone number quickly, realizing that on the main menu of the phonebook the woman's name was “Agatha H.” and the zip code denounced that she was from Massachusetts. </p><p>“Here.” She handed the phone back and Agatha typed something, one second later Rio’s phone chimed. </p><p>“Done.” Agatha said. “Text me when you get back safely, ok? I’ll see you tomorrow.” She passed through Rio in the opposite direction that Rio hostel was, leaving a quick squeeze on her shoulder as she left.</p><p>Rio got up and watched as she left, the elegant and confident way she walked down the street. The walk of a straight married woman with a child.</p><p> </p><p>                                  _________</p><p> </p><p>Rio laid in the complete darkness of her room after buying some food on her way back to the hostel, the blue light of her phone illuminating her face as she tried to find any information about Agatha. Her phone number wasn't registered anywhere and the research by image she tried to do with her profile picture - a beautiful shot of Agatha's side profile against a beige wall, highlighting her hair and nose - only led her to Pinterest pages. Social media was even more difficult since Rio just used Instagram and Twitter, there were a million different Agathas.</p><p>Then, she remembered the informations on the phone and typed “Massachusetts Agatha H.” Her jaw fell open with the results.</p><p>“What the fuck…” She whispered.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Climate change advocate, Massachusetts’ governor Agatha Harkness strikes again.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness reveals intention to campaign for U.S Senate.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Soccer Mom turned politician: The journey of Agatha Harkness.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She had just spent the evening hours talking nonsense with a political figure, without even knowing who she was. Letting her curiosity get the best out of her, Rio clicked on the last article.</p><p>It didn't dived too deep in her life, mostly the basics of how she was a 51-year-old woman who never considered going into politics until she became a mother and decided to make a better world for her son, how her husband had been incredibly supportive on her journey by becoming a stay at home dad, she had won in 2018 and now considered resigning as governor to run for senator.</p><p>Talk about a big project coming up.</p><p>On the very next morning Rio woke up with a text from Agatha, sending her the location of a nearby restaurant where they could have lunch together. Rio didn't know people in politics, especially in seats as important as Agatha's, she was intrigued by how she was so normal.</p><p>Rio got up and dressed herself in white rompers with a golden belt, along with hay colored sandals, brushing her short hair and parting it on the side. She got her purse and splashed the tiniest bit of her floral perfume before having breakfast on the hostel and going out to kill some time until it was time to meet Agatha.</p><p>Exploring the Old Town for a bit, she stopped at some shops to choose something for herself, as a reminder of the trip and her bold decision of a fresh start. Rio settled on a metal wind chime with a greek eye and light green resin flowers as pendants, deciding to hang it on the door of the new home she would have after leaving Natasha's. </p><p>At noon her phone chimed with a message from Agatha, letting Rio know that she was already leaving the hotel to meet her. </p><p>Rio arrived first at the restaurant, an open air space with wooden tables and chairs adorned with white and blue decorations, as most things in Mykonos were. </p><p>“Hi!” Agatha greeted enthusiastically, sitting in front of Rio at the table. Today, she was wearing a pair of loose white pants with heels and a caramel shirt, gold jewelry decorated her neck, ears and wrist, brown turtle sunglasses on top of her head. “I hope you didn't wait too long, sometimes I take a long time getting ready.</p><p><em>It was worth the view</em>. Rio wanted to say, but held her tongue. “No problem, governor Harkness.” She teased with a smile and Agatha sighed, reclining on the chair.</p><p>“So…you figured it out?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Yes. I’m really smart actually.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, apologetic. “Sorry about not telling you befor-”</p><p>“Hey, hey.” Rio lifted a hand to interrupt her. “It 's okay. I just wanted to say that you don't need to pretend to be someone else, and you deserve a vacation.”</p><p>Agatha's ocean blue eyes stared at her with something different, that Rio couldn't exactly pinpoint what it was. “Thank you.” A beat of silence as Rio nodded at her with sympathy. “Shall we order?” </p><p>Rio enjoyed the moment to order everything that Natasha had ever judged passive-aggressively her on, the wine, the fish, the salad. Agatha complimented her choices and they fell into easy conversation again, it seemed like they never ran out of things to talk about; movies, world events, embarrassing teenager histories. One thing just merged into the other naturally, like they were in sync.</p><p>After lunch Agatha insisted that she was feeling hot and craving gelato, walking Rio to a shop she had been eyeing since the first time she saw it when walking to her hotel. Agatha ordered a small cup of butter pecan flavour and smiled playfully when Rio chose a mint chocolate chip cone of all flavours.</p><p>They walked side by side on the stone sidewalk of the beach until Rio broke the silence. “I know you probably don't wanna talk about it, but i just wanted to say i really admire your work.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I mean it. I read an interview you did about climate change and you're really smart, Agatha.” She licked her ice cream that was starting to melt under Greece’s unforgiving Sun. </p><p>“Well, it's easy when so many people are dumb. Like those woke mobs that refuse to acknowledge that vaccines cause autism.”</p><p>Rio froze in place, until she heard Agatha laughing loudly at her reaction. “Sorry, it's my go to joke.” They resumed their walk for a few more steps. “Can I confess something to you, Rio?”</p><p>Rio hummed and she continued. “I tend to say that I chose this job because I wanted the world to change, but I don't believe that. I mean, I do want it, but I know most things are beyond my control.”</p><p>“You do the most you can.” Rio assured her. </p><p>Agatha nodded, sure. “I know. But you know what I really wanted? The power. I love to feel like I have the authority on something, that things will bend on my will, that i can do more than other people. Is that insane?” </p><p>"No, it's not insane at all.” Rio understood the feeling and identified with it. </p><p>She stared at Agatha as the woman licked clean the spoon of her gelato, suddenly a heat rose from her chest to her neck by catching the movement of her pink tongue swirling around the plastic, Rio's mouth slightly gaped in a subtle exhale when Agatha's lips closed on the spoon and sucked, pulling it out with a pop and looking at Rio.</p><p>“Rio,your shirt!” Agatha exclaimed and Rio flinched, feeling the wet and sticky texture against her fingers and clothes. She held the cone too close and the ice cream dripped on her, leaving her clear romper with an extensive and large light green stain with brown freckles.</p><p>“Ugh!” Rio groaned loudly, pulling the fabric forward as it began to stick uncomfortably on her skin. “God!”</p><p>“Come on.” Agatha said and Rio could hear the humor in her voice. She grabbed Rio's cone from her hand and threw it on the nearest trash can, guiding Rio forward with a hand on her back.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Rio asked, confused, trying to wipe her hand clean with the napkin the shopper gave her. </p><p>“To my hotel, it's closest from here.” Agatha answered. “We’ll get you cleaned up and I will lend you some clothes.” </p><p>They hurried to the luxurious hotel and Rio didn't even have time to take all the expensive details in before Agatha put her on the elevator to her room. </p><p>Alone in it, they bursted into laughter with the situation. </p><p>“Ok, I will see what I have that matches you.” Agatha announced, opening her room's door. It was large, looked and smelled expensive. </p><p>“It's fine, Agatha. Anything will do.” </p><p>“Nonsense.” Agatha scoffed. “I'm not letting you wander around Greece in any piece of cloth.”</p><p>She handed Rio a white sheath dress with golden buttons on the front. “Wow.”</p><p>Agatha winked at her, putting the dress on her hands. </p><p>Rio got in the big bathroom inside the room, washed her hands and unbuttoned her clothing, letting it fall to the ground and cursing herself for deciding not to wear a bra now that her skin was feeling gross with the dried ice cream. She dampened the face towel on the sink and wiped her torso. </p><p>When Rio lifted her head she realized two things. One, she forgot to close the door and it was slightly open. Two, she could see a glimpse on the mirror of Agatha looking at her by the reflection of the mirror inside the room, with her mouth half open and eyes darkened. Rio felt her cheeks get red by the fact that she caught Agatha staring shamelessly at her body, but she held their eye contact through the mirror for a second before the other woman looked away, so fast that Rio could think that the whole moment had been a hallucination</p><p>“All done.” She said stepping out of the bathroom in Agatha's dress that suited her better than expected, unsure on how to act.</p><p>“It looks great!” Agatha exclaimed, like nothing had happened. Maybe it hadn't, maybe Rio had been touchstarved for too long and was starting to crave any type of interest, especially from a beautiful woman she enjoyed the company of. </p><p>“Thanks for this, I will get it back to you as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Don't worry about it.” Agatha smiled. “So, tomorrow I will have this video call with my son to talk to him, i was thinking about maybe going to the beach after.” She said in a tone that was clearly inviting. “Perhaps go clubbing at night? This island is very famous for it.” </p><p>Rio nodded, she actually felt contempt that Agatha took the lead of their meetings. “Sure, i would like that.” </p><p> </p><p>                             _________</p><p>The Sun was set high on the afternoon of the third day of Rio Vidal’s grand ditching my cheater wife adventure.</p><p>She was plastered in sun filter and tanning lotion, lounging in a beach chair while the breeze coming from the Sea kissed her hair.</p><p>“God, I love vacations.” Agatha sighed next to her. She had just come back from a swim and looked like a ghost with a white plaster of reapplied sunscreen on her skin that had a fairer shade than Rio’s. She had a brown swimsuit on and her long hair fell in wet strands on her back. Rio tried her best not to stare.</p><p>She smiled. “How 's your son?” </p><p>“Ah, Nicki is great.” Agatha closed her eyes. “Having the time of his life while his dad lets him have all the candy he wants.” </p><p>This pierced through Rio's bubble. </p><p>She thought Agatha was fascinating. The way she moved, talked, how she always seemed to have a sharp response or joke at the tip of her tongue, showing how clever she was. And beautiful. Agatha was so beautiful. </p><p>Rio could discern her feelings, and she could tell that if Agatha wasn't a straight lady, Rio would be incredibly attracted and obsessed with her, doing the most to have her attention.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't happen. And Agatha's reminder that she had a husband woke her up.</p><p>Rio took a photo of the sea and posted on her instagram stories, ignoring the message request from a few of Natasha's friends' accounts. Messages from Natasha herself pleading for Rio to unblock her so they could talk about it, saying how sorry she was, how she wanted to mend things up. Rio blocked her friends too and deleted the requests, sighing in relief and enjoying the view after.</p><p>She came back to her hostel to get ready after tanning in the sun and swimming laps in the ocean. Rio took a cold shower and dressed herself up in a long red sundress with a slit on each side of the skirt along with sandals without heels, leaving her hair a bit messy on purpose and applying a deep red lipstick. She was single now, maybe she could have some fun.</p><p>They met again on the door of the club and Rio made an effort to not linger on how Agatha looked. She was wearing a skintight black dress, barely any makeup and her skin was flushed red because of the Sunbathing, enhancing the freckles she had along her back and cleavage, a courtesy of aging.</p><p>“I feel kind of ridiculous.” Agatha confessed when they were already inside with drinks in their hands. “I thought this would be fun but now I can't stop thinking how I'm already fifty in a place like this.”</p><p>“Agatha, look around. Everyone is having their own fun, you're allowed too.” Rio put her drink on the table and delicately involved Agatha's wrist with her hand. “Come on, let's dance.” </p><p>It was playing a remix version of “Lay All Your Love on Me” by ABBA - Rio quickly realized that grecians took the band very seriously - and Rio placed her hands on Agatha's waist playfully, moving her side to side to convince her to sway. Agatha smiled shyly and complied, slowly giving in.</p><p>At some point in the night Rio’s brain was getting scrambled with all the lights, the mix of alcohols, Agatha's smile and the pumping beat of the swedish band hits. She left Agatha on the dance floor for a minute and leaned over on the bar, feeling that everything all of sudden was really funny or she was very tipsy , and ordered a shot of tequila that went down with a burn.</p><p>“Hi!” She heard a voice next to her, turning around and seeing a slim blonde woman next to her on the bar, not being able to make much of her features.</p><p>“Hi!” </p><p>The woman got closer. “I saw you and i think you’re really pret-”</p><p>Rio didn't have time or patience for this. “Are you going to kiss me or what?”</p><p>It felt weird. The woman wasn't a bad kisser exactly, but it felt like they were totally out of sync, like their mouths didn't quite fit with each other and Rio didn't know what to do with her hands. She ended the kiss and patted the woman's shoulder in a comforting motion, leaving her there. </p><p>She got back to Agatha, who swayed completely off rhythm on the dance floor with bloodshot eyes from all the drinks they had. How was this incredibly simple woman a governor?</p><p>She stumbled inside her arms, laughing as Agatha held her by the waist. “Guess what? I just made out with a woman in the bar.”.</p><p>Agatha shot her eyebrows up. “Really?” </p><p>Rio nodded, chuckling like it was the funniest thing in the world.</p><p>“I think I need some air.” Agatha suddenly said and squirmed out of Rio, almost running to the back exit.</p><p>“Agatha!?” Rio followed right after her, not walking in a straight line but worried with the sudden outburst.</p><p>She got out of the club and saw Agatha rounding the corner of a brick alley, going after her and finding the woman pacing back and forth in the isolated space, breathing deeply with her hands covering her face. </p><p>“Is everything okay?” Rio questioned, getting closer. “Did something happen?”</p><p>Agatha just groaned, restless.</p><p>“You're leaving me in the dark here, Agatha.” Rio slurred out. </p><p>Suddenly she stopped and stared at Rio.</p><p>The next thing Rio knew, her back was against the wall and Agatha's lips were on hers.</p><p>It lasted for only a second, until Agatha stepped back with widened eyes. Rio stared back with a similar expression, wanting so much more. </p><p>She pulled Agatha by the arms and their mouths met again, this time with the politician going for it with her own already open. Agatha's mouth was hot and tasted like wine, Rio wanted to eat her. She held Agatha's head with both hands, trying to pull her impossibly closer until she felt like Agatha was shoving her tongue in her throat, her hands gripping Rio's waist possessively. </p><p>Agatha separated their mouths just to go back in, their noses bumping, she pressed Rio more against the wall by the shoulders and the lawyer traveled her hands lower, feeling a crescent need on her core and pulling Agatha even closer, the fabric of her black dress scrunched up on her hands. She lifted one leg and involved Agatha's waist with it, bringing her body against her. </p><p>In a second, Agatha’s knees met the ground and Rio's leg was over her shoulder, her hands pulling the red dress up in a frantic motion. Rio only registered what was going to happen when Agatha’s fingers pulled her panties aside and the warm tongue met her cunt. She moaned loudly, throwing her head back as her hand flew to grab at Agatha's long hair, bringing her head deeper as the woman tried to cup her entire center with her mouth, tongue swirling around her entrance and rubbing the whole way to her clit. It was sloppy and skilled, Rio was feeling so insane with pleasure that she grinded mindlessly against Agatha's face, practically sitting on it. </p><p>The movements of her tongue sped up and Agatha moaned against Rio's pussy, the vibration of it making Rio clench around her mouth, she moved her hips, feeling her clit rub repeatedly on Agatha's nose and she felt so dirty with how her folds grinded against the crook of Agatha's nose, but it also felt so good.</p><p>Pleasure build strongly in the pit of her womb and it only took a circle of Agatha's tongue on her clit for Rio to come undone almost screaming into the night air, riding the aftershocks on her mouth and pulling Agatha by the hair to stand up when she was too sensitive to bear. </p><p>She stared at Agatha, her face flushed from effort and wet with Rio's arousal. The words were still forming on her dizzy mind to say something when Agatha mumbled about going after an Uber and fled from Rio, leaving her alone against the wall, breathless and craving. </p>

<p>When she first saw the woman in the café, Agatha knew she was in trouble. </p><p>Not just because the woman was incredibly beautiful with an effortless charm about her, but also because she felt an impulsive pull towards her, a drumming inside her ribcage that longed to talk to her, even if they had never met. </p><p>So Agatha did what she did best; She lied to seem interesting. Lied about her intuition even though she knew Rio was american because she heard her ordering.</p><p>They talked for what seemed hours. It wasn't love at first sight, it was something far more dangerous. It was recognition, the feeling of freedom when you can be yourself to the other, without pretenses, without measured words.</p><p>But Agatha couldn't allow this proximity, not in the current situation she was in, a situation she didn't dared to say, because for just a few moments she wanted to be inside that bubble where she wasn't Agatha Harkness, the politician, and could allow herself to just sit and get to know a stunning and interesting woman.</p><p>She could be her friend right? Besides, she was just out of a relationship. It wasn't like something would happen between them, Agatha didn't even know if she liked women.</p><p>Until, of course, she talked about her ex wife, who she seemed so ready to get over, and Agatha felt her self control slipping. </p><p>When it was time for them to part, Agatha couldn't help but invite her immediately for lunch, she needed to see Rio again. Plus, even if it was nice having time for herself on vacation, after five days it was becoming too much silence and she didn't want to spend the week ahead all alone. Maybe, Agatha also needed a friend.</p><p>Of course Rio would find out about her identity. Of course Agatha would have to step out in real life at some point.</p><p>“I just wanted to say that you don't need to pretend to be someone else.” Rio had said.</p><p><em>Oh, Rio, you have no idea</em>. Agatha thought.</p><p>Later that day she brought Rio back to her hotel to change and she couldn't help but to think that fate was playing tricks on her. Agatha was taking off her jewelry in front of the mirror when her gaze slipped forward and she caught sight of Rio's naked torso reflected on the mirror, along with the muscles of her back and the curves of her defined thighs. It was sudden and Agatha felt the scarlet filling her cheeks, especially when Rio's eyes met her, decided, daring her to keep the contact, and Agatha couldn't.</p><p>When Rio came out of the bathroom, she put on her politician trained facade and acted like nothing had happened, like she was so used to doing, even if all she craved was throwing Rio on her bed. </p><p>When Rio left, Agatha was already feeling anxious to spend more time with her. She laid awake in bed after spending time on the hotel’s jacuzzi, resisting the impulse to touch herself thinking about Rio and her body, knowing that if she crossed this line it would have no turning back, she would never be able to view Rio as just a friend.</p><p>In the beginning of the next evening she sat down on her bed and smiled when Nicholas' smiley face appeared calling her, he had made an effort to wake up earlier and compensate for the time zone just to talk with his mom. </p><p> It reminded Agatha why her career existed. The only thing Agatha cared more than power was Nicholas. </p><p>“Hi, mom!” He greeted her, waving. Nicholas was getting so big and it filled Agatha with emotion every time.</p><p>“Hi, my love, how are you doing?”</p><p>He talked about how he was enjoying his summer vacation, how much he missed her and heard all about how his mom was enjoying Greece and missed him everyday, even though he was yawning with heavy eyes.</p><p>When he said his goodbyes, Agatha asked to talk with Ralph. Nicki passed the phone to him and went back to his room to sleep.</p><p>“Hi, Agatha.” Her husband greeted. “How's everything?”</p><p>“I met someone.” She said, without further ado.</p><p>He simply raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Did something happen?”</p><p>“No.” She assured him, shaking her head.</p><p>The video call was over quickly and Agatha got ready for the beach, opting for a bathing suit fit for a fifty-one year old mother. She enjoyed the most of the Sun, the Sea and Rio's company, trying not to think too much about how incredible she looked in the two piece black bikini, definitely not lingering on the fantasy of undoing its laces with her teeth after kissing her tan skin. </p><p>That night, Agatha acted on impulse, and she recognized that. The atmosphere and the licor going in were enough to get loose and fun, having a bit more courage to touch Rio on her arm, her waist, her back, innocent touches as they danced and walked. Until Rio told her she kissed a woman at the bar and the sudden wave of burning jealousy left Agatha suffocating, unable to breath, so she had to run.</p><p>But of course, Rio would follow her outside. Worried and considerative, and one look at her face was enough for Agatha's already altered brain to push her over the edge, making her kiss Rio on a whim. She pulled back, scared of her own actions, until Rio kissed her back and all her control melted right there. Agatha was taken by desire, her own body full of want for the woman in her arms, her mind swimming on alcohol. Rio was right there and the carnal need to have her was too much to be ignored, especially when she complied to her touches and moaned so beautifully in response to her touches. Rio tasted like heaven, her woman smell left Agatha even more tipsy, drinking from her, sucking the orgasm out of Rio. </p><p>Agatha didn't even register the moments between getting her head out from the middle of Rio's thighs and sitting on the back of an Uber breathlessly, her mouth still wet, just knowing that her flight or fight response had taken over. </p><p>                                   ________</p><p>Agatha woke up the next morning with a killer headache and moral hangover. She replayed the events of the last night - what she could remember from it - and felt hopeless. Hopeless about mending her growing friendship with Rio, knowing that she had crossed absolutely all the limits. </p><p>Her impulse was to fret again. When she reached her new destination, Agatha would do herself the mercy of sending a text to Rio to confirm their estrangement instead of seeing her eye-to-eye, apologizing for her outburst. Agatha knew the sensible thing to do was explain the situation to her public relations manager and have Rio sign an NDA, but it broke her heart to think about making Rio go through that, the same heart that made her believe that the woman would never expose her. </p><p>So she immediately started to pack her bags, sending a quick message to Ralph and her assistant to let them know about the slight change of plans, now she would spend the rest of her vacation in Athens. </p><p> Just when she finished zipping up her suitcase, a loud and incessant knock on her room’s door startled her, making Agatha go open it in a hurry thinking how much hell she would give the hotel’ clerk responsible for it.</p><p>When the door opened, a feminine figure with short hair flew inside her room. Disheveled like she had been running, it only took Agatha two seconds to recognize Rio. </p><p>They stared at each other for a few moments, Rio trying to catch her breath as Agatha didn't even know what to say.</p><p>Rio looked at her bed where the suitcase rested and then back at her. “Something told me you would try to run away from me.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“Don't.” She held a finger at Agatha, her face was red and she looked hurt, desperate. “All this time you did what you wanted with me,so you’ll let me talk!”</p><p>Agatha stood silent, feeling ashamed.</p><p>“What is this, huh?” Rio paced in the room, gesticulating with her hands. “Is that how things workout for you? You put this big facade of the perfect straight politician to any unaware woman you find interesting until you get her to be your friend enough to hookup?”</p><p>Agatha gaped her mouth to speak, but Rio didn't let her.</p><p>“And i <em>swear</em>, if you give me the ‘This never happened before’ shit I will not buy it, Agatha.” Rio chuckled skeptically, frustrated. “Last night you <em>knew</em> what you were doing. What about your husband? Is he sitting at his perfect stay at home dad figure back in Boston? Is he aware that his wife is going around Greece having affairs? With other women? Will you tell him?” Rio's voice got louder and pitchy with every sentence. “Does he know!?”</p><p>Agatha exploded. “He knows,Rio! He knows!” She shouted and Rio immediately paused, looking at Agatha unconvinced. “He always knew.”</p><p>Only when the last word left her mouth, Agatha realized the angry tears rolling on her face. Rio crossed her arms at her, still skeptical but a bit more softened.</p><p>Agatha felt her legs giving out, so she promptly crossed the room and sat on her bed, taking a few breaths before continuing. “I told him, I always tell him.”</p><p>“And he is okay with it?” Rio asked, cynical. “Your husband knows you cheat on him constantly and is completely fine with the situation?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, running her hands through her face, there was nothing she could do know except telling the truth. “We’re not married, at least not in the way a marriage works. He had been my friend for years when we started dating, eventually we got married but i <em>always</em> felt like something was wrong, even when we had Nicki. Just a few years after he was born, I came to terms that I was a lesbian, and i told Ralph, he knows as long as I have.”</p><p>Rio pushed the inside of her cheek with her tongue, her gaze sharp towards Agatha, analyzing each word that left her mouth.</p><p>“When we settled on a divorce, I got the opportunity to run for governor. What should I do? Being funded as a woman in politics is already hard, imagining being a divorced lesbian who already has a son? They would eat me alive, Rio.” </p><p>“So, how does that work?”</p><p>“I allow Ralph his life and his fun, and he allows me mine.” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“What about your son? Does he know mom and dad dont date each other?” She asked, still irritated.</p><p>And that irritated Agatha. “<em>We</em>, his parents, don't bring him into this. So you don't have to either.” </p><p>“So what? You just sleep around with women you pray won't know who you are?” </p><p>“No,Rio.” Agatha breathed for a second. “Most women I do get with are in similar positions as I am. Hiding or in secret agreements. I don't use to be with women outside this world, especially now with the upcoming campaign. Not until…” </p><p><em>You</em>. The word hung in the air. </p><p>“You must have one hell of a PR team, don't you?” Rio broke the silence.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You have no idea.” A beat of silence. “I'm sorry, Rio. I really like your company and our conversations. I guess I got carried away with it. Somehow, you made me feel like I was any other woman, like I was normal.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her defenses slowly building down. </p><p>“I don't want our <em>friendship</em> to end like this.” Agatha concluded, knowing that she just couldn't leave any margin for Rio to think that they could be more than that. </p><p>Rio stared directly at her, thinking for a second. “I'm willing to leave <em>this</em> behind if you are. Like i said, i really need a friend right now.”</p><p>Agatha smiled without humour, but if this was the only thing she could have with Rio, she would take it. “I am. Let's just forget about <em>it</em>.” She said even though she was unable to forget how Rio tasted, dancing around the words, scared to say something that would revive the moment they shared and end up with them tangled on the hotel bed.</p><p>“Where were you going?” Rio asked, eyeing the suitcase on the bed. Agatha flushed in embarrassment.</p><p>“I was thinking about spending the remaining days in Athens.” Agatha answered like she wasn't going to leave Rio without warning just half an hour ago.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio said. “Give me one hour, I will pack my bags.”</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows. “What?” </p><p>“Well, you said we should stick together and I agree. I’m going with you.” She said, not leaving space for Agatha to protest even if she wanted to. And she didn't. </p><p>“All right.”</p><p>“Don't go running away from me again.” The woman ordered,walking to the door at a determined pace. </p><p>                                     ________</p><p>They left Mykonos for good just two hours later, laughing and talking over lunch on the ferry. Like nothing had happened, like Agatha's lips weren't devouring Rio's mouth less than twenty-four hours ago. </p><p>Agatha felt like she was leaving the memories of the night before on the island, the only moment she truly had Rio forever engraved on the alley wall, ensuring that it wouldn't follow after her. </p><p>It was a long way to Athens and it was nice to have someone with her during the route, to gossip or laugh at silly videos she found on her phone. Rio slept on the seat next to her at some point, and Agatha fought against the thoughts about how adorable she looked like this, the slight pout of her lips, how her long lashes rested against her skin. </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha nudged her lightly. “I was thinking about booking a villa instead of a hotel. What do you think?”</p><p>“It's great.” Rio slurred out, sleepy. “I will Venmo you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “It's all on me, don't worry.”</p><p>The thought that she sounded like a sugar mommy crossed her mind and it was buried away just as quickly as it came.</p><p>“If you're like, super rich, why do you insist on not taking a private jet and boat and joining us mortals instead?” Rio asked as they carried their bags out of the port, looking for their Uber.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I like the feeling of normalcy, I guess.”</p><p>“Yeah, only someone super rich would say something like that.”</p><p>She laughed. “And, you know, global warming.”</p><p>“Oh,yeah.” Rio smiled. “I forgot i was talking to Greta Thumberg’s mother.” </p><p>“And Taylor Swift’s worst enemy.” Agatha responded and Rio bursted into a loud laugh, teasing Agatha the whole way with the fact she made a pop culture joke, just on the borderline of calling her old. </p><p>Rio's jaw fell when they arrived at the “small villa” Agatha had guaranteed her it was. It was more like a mansion, with three floors, four bedrooms and a pool.</p><p>“It doesn't have any staff.” Agatha said, apologetic, like Rio expected to have it. </p><p>“Guess you will have a real throwback to normal life, then.”  </p><p>After placing her things in her chosen room, Agatha went to find Rio's. </p><p>“It's getting kind of late, do you want to grab dinner?” Agatha asked on the door, watching Rio hang her clothes on the wooden wardrobe.</p><p>“Yeah, I would.” Rio groaned. “I'm starving.”</p><p>“Get dressed.” Agatha said and it sounded more like an order than a suggestion. “I’ll pick somewhere nice.” </p><p>Rio nodded at her with something different in her eyes, the sudden change in the atmosphere running a shiver up Agatha's spine.</p><p>Agatha put on her white going out dress, feeling a little bit more loose, not even straightening her hair and letting it fall on its natural waves down her back. She got down first and waited for Rio on the couch, having a privileged view when the woman got down the steps, wearing a leather skirt and white button down paired with big green earrings. Agatha couldn't help but notice that from a certain view, they were matching.</p><p>“You parted your hair in the middle tonight.” Agatha said inside the car after taking a look at her shoulder length strands, catching Rio's attention. “It looks nice.”</p><p>The tip of Rio's ears went pink as she nodded in appreciation that Agatha noticed this detail about her. </p><p>Dinner went so nicely that no one from outside could ever guess that the women laughing and furtively touching each other's hands and arms had a decisive fight just this morning miles away from there. It was a full course meal that, by Rio's request, was completely picked out by Agatha.</p><p>Agatha realized that Rio was giving her more and more the power of decision and authority that she liked so much.</p><p>They went back to the villa with full stomachs and light heads, stumbling on the entrance and laughing.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.” Rio whispered in the dark of the living room, on the first steps of the stairs. Agatha's heart got faster when she realized that their hands were loosely intertwined.</p><p>“Goodnight.” She whispered back, her eyes involuntary falling on Rio's lip.</p><p>Rio smirked at her, pulling her arm just so as she began going up the stairs, letting go of her hand after two steps. Agatha let her arm fall on her side, her hand with a longing itch as Rio bit her lip trying to contain a smile, walking up to her own room still looking directly into Agatha's eyes, the same eyes that followed her until she disappeared on the hallway. </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and breathed deeply, forcing her legs to obey the command of not going after Rio. </p><p>It was six p.m on Massachusetts when Agatha called her “husband” who picked up after just two rings.</p><p>“Agatha? Everything okay? I saw you’re already in Athens.”</p><p>“Yes, everything is fine.” She lied.</p><p>But again, he had always been a good friend.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>She sighed. “Ralph, something happened.” </p><p>Agatha let it all out. She told him about who Rio Vidal was, what had happened at the club, how she felt so drawn to this woman she met only three days ago, how her feelings were conflicting and she was doing her best for her brain to win over her heart. He listened attentively, not judging her in the slightest. </p><p>“What scares you, Agatha?” He asked earnestly.</p><p>“<em>Everything</em>. I can't take those kinds of risks right now, you know this. And she's from New York, Ralph. We wouldn't be seeing much of each other.”</p><p>“Isn't that a good thing?” He asked on the other line. Agatha stayed silent. “Agatha, i'm beginning to think you want more than a fling with her.”</p><p>She scoffed. “That's insane. We’ve known each other for less than a week.”</p><p>“Stranger things have happened.” He simply said. “Come on, you're on vacation. Enjoy it, Agatha. Give up on being Agatha Harkness, the governor, for at least three days. Settle on being just Agatha.”</p><p>“I can't.” She said under her breath, feeling the weight of all the roles she had to play right on her shoulders. The governor, the mother, the fake wife, the secret lover, the woman. “You know I can't.”</p><p>When she woke up the next day, her mind associated that it was the fifth of the seven days she and Rio would have together. </p><p>Agatha got out of her room and went to find her. Rio was already up, brushing her hair. “So, what do you think about grocery shopping? This house has nothing besides wholegrains and a liquour cabinet.”</p><p>“I actually think this is more than enough.” Rio said with a sly smile that Agatha mirrored. “But i think it would be funny to see you get lost on the dairy aisle, let's go.” </p><p>“Ha ha.” Agatha fake mocked. “You're <em>hilarious</em>, Rio.” </p><p>Rio guided her downstairs with a hand on her back, like it was an automatic motion. Agatha didn't complain. </p><p>They walked under the Sun, getting the basics on the local supermarket and covering the rest on the farmer’s market. Agatha actually enjoyed the rekindled feeling of shopping for her own stuff, choosing it with her own hands. Rio’s company made everything better, even if she teased Agatha relentlessly. </p><p>At lunchtime, Agatha insisted on doing the dish she actually did for herself back at home. </p><p>“What do you even put on this thing?” Rio asked, watching as her hands moved from over her shoulder.</p><p>“Honey, you don't know what’s in a greek salad?” Agatha asked, outraged, and went on about all the ingredients she had carefully selected for the dish. </p><p>The salad was surprisingly good and Rio didn't spare her compliments, offering herself to do the dishes after they ate.</p><p>Afternoon came with a windy breeze that they enjoyed with a walk by the beach, having cocktails on three different kiosks for the sake of experimenting. On the second, Agatha pretended that she didn't notice Rio declining calls from an unknown number, not ready to put Rio's past relationship on top of everything else. They lounged on the bars cushioned chairs to watch the sunset, the mesmerizing view of orange meeting blue.</p><p>“What's for dinner?” Rio asked with humor when they entered the house, throwing her beach bag on the counter. </p><p>“Honestly, I have no idea. I never have to think this much about my meals.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “Let’s figure something out.” </p><p>By figuring something out, Rio meant putting Agatha to do the hard work on flavoring and cutting the chicken they had brought earlier while Rio occupied herself with the potatoes. It all seemed so domestic, so casual, so common. </p><p>When they managed to put it into the oven, Rio connected her phone to the sound system while Agatha opened the liquour cabinet, choosing a sweet wine for them to drink.</p><p>“I will take a shower.” Rio announced. “Hey, maybe we can hit the pool after dinner.”</p><p>“Yeah, we could.” Agatha agreed. “I’ll get ready too.”</p><p>Agatha went back to the kitchen just half an hour later, wearing a purple silky robe over the black bikini she had chosen for the occasion, a little bit more bolder than her usual “moms” swimsuits. Rio was already placing the food on the table, wearing a black see through flowy dress over her black swimsuit, which was low cut with a gold accessory holding the front together, leaving few things for imagination. Her hair was parted in the middle. </p><p>“Dinner is served.” Rio announced playfully, reclining on the table. Her skin was almost golden under the light. </p><p>Agatha thought that she looked like a wife. </p><p>Until she remembered that Rio <em>was</em> someone's wife. At least on paper. </p><p>The sound still hummed in the background as they ate, sitting closer than needed on the big table, laughing in delight about how they managed to cook something nice together. This time, Agatha did the dishes while Rio sat on the couch with a glass of wine. When Agatha sat on the couch,Rio already had glass ready for her and they clinked it together, on a small toast. </p><p>“Oh, i love this song.” Rio said after a few large sips when ABBA’s ‘One of Us.’ started to echo in the room. </p><p>Agatha laughed, even if it wasn't that funny, she already had her fair share of drinks. “I think you match with all of this Greece holiday style, you know?”</p><p>“That's the best compliment I ever got.” Rio said with her eyes closed and smiling, her head resting against the couch's back. </p><p>‘<em>I saw myself as a concealed attraction</em></p><p><em>I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action</em>.’</p><p>The song said and Agatha sipped desperately on her wine, hoping the alcohol would wash away her want for Rio. </p><p>When the music ended, “Endless Love” by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross started to play. </p><p>“Aw, i love this one too.” Rio whined and looked at Agatha for a second before putting her glass on the table and standing up, reaching a hand out to her. </p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, trying to play it coy.</p><p>“Come on, let's dance.” Agatha stared at her, not sure if this was a sensible thing to do, until Rio tipped her head to the side with a pout and she gave in completely, holding Rio's hand and letting her body be pulled forward.</p><p>Rio held her by the waist and hand, Agatha placed her other hand on Rio's shoulder, pressing their bodies together as they swayed side to side on the carpet. She felt like looking into Rio's eyes was too much, so she softly pressed their cheeks together, feeling Rio's breath ricocheting against her neck and hair. Maybe this was also too much. </p><p>She let her body almost slump against Rio's, not remembering the last time she was held like this, with such care, with such affection. The woman's body was warm beneath her hands, heat emanating through the thin fabrics that separated them.</p><p>The song slowly faded away and they separated when a more upbeat one started to play.</p><p>Agatha felt dizzy, the smell of Rio's skin making her mouth water.</p><p>“Come on.” Rio whispered, separating from her. “Let's swim.” </p><p>She watched as Rio walked to the pool through the glass double doors of the living room, how she slid her dress off and looked at Agatha over her shoulder as an invite before diving in. Agatha walked slowly towards the pool, undoing the knot that held her robe together and letting the clothing hit the floor. She felt self conscious when Rio’s eyes met her body as she entered the pool, a need to cover herself up until she recognized that the woman's expression was nothing short of desire.</p><p>The water was warm, but Agatha was shivering.</p><p>Rio got closer to her in silence, the small waves of water rocking their bodies. Her hand reached Agatha's hair, sliding on her hairline to put a strand behind her ear. </p><p>“Agatha…” Her voice was low and soft, her hand lingered on Agatha's hair, it sounded like a plea. “How long will we keep pretending that nothing is happening?” </p><p>Agatha sighed and closed her eyes, feeling her body melt against Rio's. She was so tired of faking, and Rio seemed to know how to knock her defenses out just right.</p><p>That's when she whimpered when Rio's lips found her neck in a wet and delicate kiss, her mouth going down the extent of it with gentle suctions and slight nibbles of her teeth. Her hands held Rio's waist when the woman held one of her cheeks and kissed the other dangerously close to her mouth, a silent request for permission that Agatha granted.  </p><p>Their mouths finally met after what seemed like ages, it was slow and deep, tongues searching for each other. Rio’s fingers undid the strands that kept Agatha's bikini top together, sliding the fabric down and leaving her torso bare. </p><p>Agatha suddenly felt timid with it, keeping her eyes closed and holding her own face through sighs of pleasure when Rio squeezed her boob with one hand as her agile mouth took the other. Her tongue swirled around Agatha's hard nipple, her teeth grabbing at it with ease, ripping uncontrollable moans out of her.</p><p>When Agatha realized, she was against the swimming pool wall and Rio held her waist, elevating her body so Agatha would sit on the edge, her own body still on the water. Wordlessly, she pushed Agatha back until she was relying on her elbows and placed her legs on top of her shoulders, undoing the side knots of the woman's underwear.</p><p>Agatha moaned with anticipation, the adrenaline pumping through her veins when Rio nosed and kissed the insides of her thighs, her hands scratching the outers. “You’re <em>divine</em>, Agatha.” Rio said before her mouth met Agatha's cunt. </p><p>Rio was skilled and worked Agatha out with firm laps of her tongue, making the woman moan and whimper continuously with the nonstop surge of pleasure. She inserted her tongue inside of Agatha's wetness easily, getting a loud “Oh,God!” from the politician. She was completely at Rio's mercy, clenching around the thrusts of her rigid tongue and her arms were shaking with effort to keep her body upright. </p><p>Her eyebrows joined when she felt the build up to her orgasm, her mouth slacking open as her eyes met Rio's, who watched her adoryling from between her thighs, a determined glint on them to give Agatha all that she deserved. </p><p>Agatha came with a moan so loud that for a moment she hoped that all the neighbors were too distant to hear it, her legs giving out as Rio worked her through the high. She breathed rapidly when Rio took her head out, looking at Agatha in a obvious question. <em>Will you run again?</em></p><p>Agatha lowered her legs and slid into the water again, completely naked, pulling Rio by the neck to kiss again.</p>

<p>The cold droplets ricocheted against the tiles while Rio rinsed her hair under the continuous stream of water. She hugged herself by the shoulders, feeling how the chloride remains were washed away, pretending to not care at all about Agatha, who was leaning on the sink’s marble, completely naked, filing her nails. </p><p>Rio really put an effort in pretending that her thighs weren't pressed against each other to try and ease the pulsing ache between her legs, knowing that Agatha was casually preparing herself to be knuckles deep inside her. So, when she furtively saw through the glass door Agatha placing the nail file back on the counter, Rio turned against the wall and got under the water, definitely not shaking. </p><p>Agatha slid into the shower and hugged Rio from behind, sighing with the pressure of her back against her boobs and bringing both hands to cup Rio's breasts, clipping her nipples against her fingers and making her moan, throwing her head back on Agatha's shoulder, almost slumping her body against her. </p><p>She took Rio's hair out of the way gently, her lips sucking on the back of her neck, her shoulderblades, licking a strip on the crook where her neck met her shoulder, guiding herself by Rio's sighs of pleasure and want. </p><p>Finally, Rio felt Agatha spinning her around with both hands on her waist, gluing their mouths together. </p><p>It was filthy and raw, their tongues lacing together more outside their mouths than in, Agatha's fingers pressed bruises on Rio's skin while the other woman's knuckles dived into her long hair and scalp, pulling at it tightly.</p><p>Agatha pushed Rio against the opposite wall, grabbing one of her thighs and hooking her leg on her waist, her mouth sucked on Rio's neck at the same time two fingers entered her heat, she had no time to waste anymore.</p><p>Rio moaned in relief, digging her nails so hard on Agatha's shoulders that it left crescent moon shapes, which made Agatha whimper against her neck, moving her mouth to capture Rio's lips in a nerve searing kiss, thrusting her fingers slowly inside her. </p><p>Rio held Agatha's face with both hands, kissing her back with want while her hips circled consistently against the in-and-out motion, moaning on the other woman's mouth. Agatha smiled shamelessly at her, feeling insanely proud of the effect she was causing on her , Rio smiled at her and caressed her bottom lip with her thumb, watching amazed as Agatha opened her mouth to welcome the digit inside it, sucking it deep inside.  </p><p>She brought Agatha's body closer with her hooked leg, the movements of her hips getting more erratic by the second, chasing the maddening pressure of Agatha's bony fingers caressing on where she was wettest. </p><p>“<em>Oh</em>!” Rio moaned and it sounded more like a choked sob, throwing her head back on the tiles and thrusting her thumb on Agatha's mouth at the same pace the other woman has fucking her, doing her best to meet her halfway with her hips. It was too overwhelming, the growing pleasure of Agatha inside her, her tongue swirling around the sensitive skin of Rio's fingertip while her eyes never left each other's, the feeling of their chests pressed against each other, nipples rubbing together and Rio's hand holding onto Agatha's back, making her feel so stimulated without even being touched yet. </p><p>Agatha pressed her fingers deeper and curved them forward, finding Rio's most sensitive and swollen spot, dragging her fingers on it one, two times before Rio was convulsing against the wall, cumming for Agatha and snapping her hips madly, rolling on her fingers through her orgasm, moaning breathlessly and high-pitched. She snatched her finger out of Agatha's mouth with a pop, grabbing at the back of her hair and pulling her into a deep kiss, the tongue sucking on hers making Rio feel so weak that her body collapsed forward. Agatha was there to hold her with a firm arm around her waist. </p><p>Rio sighed and rested her head on Agatha's shoulder, breathing deeply still feeling the aftershocks of pleasure and how her muscles still contract against the fingers inside her. She hugged Agatha by the shoulders, whimpering in hypersensitivity when the two fingers slipped out, descending her shaky leg from her waist and feeling it cramp a little when her foot touched the floor again, she could feel how her thighs were wet with her release. Agatha held her with both arms now, caressing Rio's hair and waiting for her breathing to normalize. </p><p>Rio slowly lifted her head up with dazed watery eyes, looking completely fucked out when Agatha gently pushed back the wet strands of her hair out of her face. “Ok?” She asked and Rio nodded weakly. “Let's go to bed, then.”</p><p>She took Rio's hand and turned off the shower, pulling the woman to the room without even bothering to get a towel. Agatha let go of her hand and sat on the bed, scanning Rio's boy with dark eyes. “You're ex-wife is a fucking idiot.” Agatha said and Rio bit her lip, launching forward and tackling Agatha to lay on the bed with a kiss so deep that pulled the air from her lungs. “If I had a woman like you, I would never leave the house.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio teased, beginning a trail of kisses on her cheek, jaw and neck. </p><p>“They would never see me on the street again.” Agatha said, aware of the nonsenses she was saying but too aroused to care, squeezing Rio's ass when her mouth reached her cleavage. </p><p>“Uhm.” Rio moaned against her skin, her mouth opening and taking Agatha's nipple slowly in her mouth just with her lips, circling the hard peak with the tip of her tongue. </p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha moaned, gripping her hair with her other hand and snapping her hips up, trying to get more contact in the wet warmth of her intimacy. Rio's thigh infiltrated between her legs, her knee making the mattress dip down when she rubbed it against Agatha's cunt, which made her arch her back and moan scandously, she could feel how moist and hot Agatha was against her leg. </p><p>Rio kissed her again, it felt so good to have her mouth on hers. Everything about it felt so intimate, so warm and comfortable, how Agatha's hands touched her back, her arms, the shivers that passed through her with it. Agatha herself felt so deliriously, she felt a deep need to get closer to Rio until their bodies could merge, open Rio ribcage and live inside her heart.</p><p>Their kisses grew more desperate and Rio noticed how Agatha was circling her hips up, getting even closer to Rio’s center. She realized what Agatha's body was unconsciously trying to do.</p><p>She held Agatha's jaw and pressed her head on the pillow, looking directly into her confused and lust filled eyes. </p><p>“Tell me what you want,Agatha.” Rio felt so thrilled that she had an upper hand, how she knew that she only was in power now because Agatha was allowing her to. </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, nails scratching the sides of Rio's body, refusing to yield. </p><p>“Tell me.” Rio whispered with their faces closer, their mouths brushing with each word.</p><p>Agatha only chuckled pervertly and suddenly opened Rio's legs with her own, making her lose balance and fall on top of her, moaning breathlessly when her folds rubbed against Agatha's mound with the sudden movement. “Nice effort.” She husked out in Rio's ear that was hovering next to her mouth. “Won't you be a good girl and give me what we both want?” </p><p>Rio gulped and nodded, accepting defeat and feeling victorious at the same time. </p><p>She passed one of Agatha's leg on top of her thigh, slouching one of her own on top of Agatha's, aligning their entrances and lowering her body slowly until their folds finally met.</p><p>They moaned in unison and Rio began jerking her hip forward, dragging her cunt up against Agatha's, their wetness together making an obscene sound. The wet friction of the swollen lips sending shock after shock of pleasure. Agatha held her waist and helped her move, her moans getting more constant and quick as Rio fucked her pussy with her own, their entrances bumping together in a way that made the women whimper.</p><p>Rio held herself up with one hand on the mattress, positioning her hard clit on Agatha's smaller folds and pressing in like she was trying to get <em>inside</em> Agatha with it. </p><p>Agatha moaned deliriously with it, throwing her head back on the pillow and digging her nails in Rio's thighs, urging her to go faster, go rougher, do something, do anything.</p><p>Rio compiled and slipped forward in the wetness, looking down to where they connected and moaning with the sight of their juices merging together, the slick wetting the sparse hairs around their pussies. She started to circle her hips, making her clit rub relentlessly against Agatha's , moaning with the effort and pleasure, fueled by Agatha's whimpers and staccato moans.</p><p>“Ah!” The older woman managed to let out. “Rio! Rio,baby, i'm gonna cum.”</p><p>“Wait for me.” She pleaded with a whimper, supporting herself with one hand on Agatha's stomach to grind faster, closing her eyes and letting her mouth fall open as pleasure traveled concentrated in her center, announcing that she was close. “Agatha!” She moaned, alarmed. “Agatha, that's it,love,come for me.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her even closer and obeyed, cumming loudly and gushing on Rio's cunt, smearing her release on their joint pleasure, the feel of the liquid hitting her most sensitive place leading Rio to an overpowering orgasm.</p><p>She kept going, working them both through their climaxes sloppy and desperate, only slowing it down when it was too much for them to take</p><p>                                        ____</p><p>They woke up the next day still tangled in each other's warmth under the sheets, a pleasant soreness along their bodies. </p><p>Agatha was the first to make a move and stand up, kissing Rio's shoulder on her way out of bed to take a shower and get ready for the day. As she dried her hair in front of the mirrors, Agatha tried not to dwell on the pain compressing her chest with the realization it was her last full 24 hours by Rio's side. </p><p>When Rio went down the stairs in a robe, she smiled by finding Agatha battling against the kitchen utensils to make them a decent scrambled egg. She poured some coffee in a mug and gave Agatha a morning peck on the lips, thinking how domestic and natural it all felt, trying to hold on to each second that passed by too fast for her liking.</p><p>They got ready together in the room, almost in sync. Agatha buttoned Rio's loose shirt and Rio did the favor of undoing gently all the knots made by herself on Agatha's long hair with a brush. </p><p>“So, where are we going?” Rio asked as she locked the door of their villa. </p><p>“You’ll see.” Agatha answered, enigmatic. </p><p>When Rio realized, she was standing in the Acropolis.</p><p>She let herself be guided by Agatha through the temple, hypnotized by her voice explaining in such detail all that she knew about the place. Later, Agatha pulled her inside the museum and walked her through the artifacts and sculptures, looking like a kid in the candy shop. Both stood in front of the famous Caryatids and Rio could see how Agatha's eyes were filled with emotion.</p><p>“I really like this, you know?” Agatha said under her breath. “The thought, no, the feeling, that something can be immortalized. Be remembered. All those people, who lived so long ago, in one way or another they are seen here, remembered.”</p><p>Rio smiled without her teeth, blinking slowly, trying to memorize Agatha's face in this exact moment. </p><p>As they walked towards Monastiraki Square, Agatha's breath hitched when she felt Rio's shy pinky finger lacing on her own loosely, in a clear request for permission. Agatha decided that she could afford at least one bold decision, slipping her hand on Rio's and intertwining their fingers, walking around the square like they were any couple on vacation, even buying an artisanal azalea and green leaves scented soap together. She took Rio to the nicest restaurant nearby and pulled a chair for her to sit, emerging completely on the day-long fantasy of a regular life. </p><p>Agatha snapped a picture of Rio discreetly as she ate, mid sentence and gesturing with her fork, hair swept by the breeze and golden in the sun. She smiled at the screen, cherishing it. </p><p>When they walked hand in hand to the beach, Rio turned at her with one hand closed and revealed a flower as she opened it, like she had conjurated it. Agatha took it from her hand with cheeks flushed and a small smile, unaware that just as she turned to the side to point the way Rio had eternalized her image,holding the gift like it was precious, on her phone. </p><p>They sat on the warm sand, observing how the waves clashed on the rocks and the smell of the sea, fingers interlocked tightly as if it would keep the moment from slipping away. </p><p>Rio broke the silence. “What time is your flight tomorrow?"</p><p>“At four.” Agatha said, feeling the bitterness in her voice. “Yours?”   </p><p>“Three thirty.” Rio’s voice shook and she squeezed Agatha’s hand like a lifeline. </p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and nodded. There was nothing else to say, the countdown had begun. Suddenly she stood up, offering a hand to Rio. “Come.”</p><p> Rio took it without hesitation, her body being pulled forward until both were running towards the ocean, laughing with the way that the strong wind reverberated in their ears, leaving a trail of sand below their bare feet and jumping into the water fully clothed. Agatha pulled her into a hug, falling in the cold foam when a wave hit them.</p><p>The fabric of their clothes cling onto their skin, the sun was unforgiving and the salt prickled their eyes. None of that mattered when they held each other and kissed in the sea, smiling by how their wet hair kept getting in the way, thinking how this could be a direct montage of Grease’s “Summer Nights”. </p><p>They lapped around each other for hours in the water, hitting each wave with their bodies and a laugh, kissing underwater.</p><p>When they reached land again, tired and tanned as the sun set, Agatha took Rio's flower in her hand again, Rio held the hand and slumped her head on Agatha's shoulder, offering the flower to the Sun and wishing that her and Agatha could meet again in this lifetime.</p><p>Night fell and Rio decided to treat Agatha for a three course dinner, walking to a balcony restaurant as their clothes dried on their bodies, hands never leaving each other's. It was a wood table with a view to the ocean and Rio retributed the courtesy of pulling her chair and even asked for a candle to be placed on the table.</p><p>“So, why Greece?” Rio asked during the main course.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I wanted somewhere beachy and as far away from America as possible. And I think it’s amazing how they have an island called Lesbos.”</p><p>“You’d be a success there.” She said and Agatha smiled, tilting her head forward.</p><p>“I did very well here, didn't I?” She teased and Rio coughed with the feel of Agatha's foot going up her leg under the tablecloth.</p><p>“What’s next, Miss Governor?” Rio teased back, dipping her hand and caressing Agatha's ankle, catching her by surprise. “If you ever leave Massachusetts again.” </p><p>“Hey, I travel!” Agatha scoffed, playfully kicking Rio's leg and placing her foot on the floor again. “I’m wordly!”</p><p>“And where have you traveled?” </p><p>Agatha thought for a moment and spent the next minutes discoursing about her adventures in the U.S West Coast, how many times she traveled through Europe and the few times she had been in Latin America.</p><p>“My honeymoon was in Puerto Rico.” Rio confessed. “I really like it there.”</p><p>“It's beautiful.” Agatha said, poking the dessert with her spoon. She looked at Rio, her eyes shiny. “Do you ever think about going again?”</p><p>Rio sighed, trying to figure out if she was reading correctly through the lines. “Yes. In a year or so. Let’s say…Next July?”</p><p>Agatha hummed with an approving nod. “I hear it's a very nice season there this time of year.” </p><p>                            __________</p><p>Going back to the villa was a relief to their tired bodies and melancholy at the same time, it meant that the minutes spent together were coming to an end and neither knew how to deal with that. </p><p>Agatha delivered a clear message when she said that wanted to take a shower alone. Rio was a bit dispirited by that, sure that they would spend their last night together, but ultimately respecting it and going back to her own room to take a shower and read a book before. </p><p>It surprised her when Agatha showed up at her room’s door wearing a silky black robe with plants patterned. </p><p>“Thought you were going to bed.” Rio commented, placing her book on the bedside table and watching hypnotized when Agatha dipped her knee on the bed and launched forward, crawling on top of her body. </p><p>“And leave you here all alone?” Agatha teased before she kissed Rio, holding her by the shoulder and straddling her lap. </p><p>Rio promptly held her hips as their tongues met,making Agatha move them forward and she moaned remembering how good it felt when they rutted against each other the night before. When Rio realized, her own hands were making quick work on Agatha's robe’s lace.</p><p>Agatha slid it off with a smug smile, revealing a deep purple lace nightgown that almost made Rio drool. She moaned loudly as Rio marked every path of skin she could find on her neckline, grabbing at her tits to massage them over the fabric, soaking it with her mouth when she took them there over the barrier of silk and lace. All her need for control dissolved with Rio's ministrations, only being able to slide down the straps of her yellow silk pajamas and mouth at her cleavage before she was mounted on Rio's body, still in the nightgown, a firm hand holding her waist as she clung to Rio's shoulders, riding three of her fingers. </p><p>They moaned so loudly that it would make them pity the neighbors even if they care, lost in lust and in the warmth of each other.</p><p>Rio couldn't get enough of Agatha's walls clenching around her, her body working desperately on top of her, chasing her pleasure. “<em>I wish i had brought my strap here.</em>” She whispered madly under her breath in Agatha's ear. “<em>I would fuck you so hard that i would put my baby in you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha moaned ridiculously loud at that, feeling stretched by Rio's fingers and riding her faster, her thighs burning with the effort, her hair falling on her flushed face, her boobs spilling out of the nighty’s bra, all of it while Rio gripped her waist firm enough to bruise and used her mouth and tongue on her neck. Agatha was in heaven. </p><p>“<em>Oh,god</em>!” She heard herself yelling, being pushed to the edge,gripping Rio's pajama blouse on her hands. “<em>I wish I could have your baby</em>.” Agatha panted, going up and down on her fingers now instead of back and forth. “<em>I would trap you with me forever.”</em></p><p>Agatha came with an actual whine, crying out Rio's name and dropping all of her weight on top of her, pinning Rio on the mattress before the woman even had the chance to slip her fingers out. She infiltrated her hand on Rio's yellow silk shorts and kissed her hard and two fingers filled her cunt with ease, going faster than ever hitting the aroused sensitive spot inside of her, Rio's moans filled her mouth as the squelch sound of the in and out motion filled the room. Rio grabbed at her hair directly on the scalp, only relaxing the grip when the orgasm took over her, wave after wave of pleasure that left her disoriented for a few seconds. </p><p>They slipped their fingers out at the same time, Agatha flopped to the side, landing breathless on the mattress. She looked at Rio's bewildered face and they couldn’t resist laughing at the frantic and desperate sex they ended up having.</p><p>Agatha covered her face with her hands, laughing awkwardly. “Oh my god. I'm so sorry about what I said.” </p><p>“No, don’t be!” Rio protested, taking Agatha's hands and kissing them, pulling her closer to her chest. “It was sexy!”</p><p>Agatha laughed, hiding her face on the crook of Rio's neck and falling into her embrace comfortably. They enjoyed the silence of each other's company, intertwined.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha felt like crying. She realized that she was never this comfortable with anyone and it scared her in the same amount that saddened.</p><p>She wished, right in that moment, to have a different life. A life that could accommodate Rio in it, that wouldn't force them to part.</p><p> </p><p>The seventh morning inevitably came and they didn't waste any time, undressing each other and getting under the covers. Agatha worked Rio out with her expert mouth and fingers, refusing to leave without tasting her again. After, Rio laid on top of her and got her off slowly with her fingers inside and a gentle thumb on her clit that made Agatha melt against the cushion. </p><p>At one p.m , after a breakfast that both spent trying to ease the tension of the upcoming goodbye, they locked their villa and handed the keys, holding hands on the back of the car driving them to the airport. </p><p>Rio's flight was the first to be called and she trembled nervously as the monitors began beeping the number of it, announcing it was time to separate. She stood in front of Agatha, her heart compressed inside her chest and a lump on her throat.</p><p>Agatha breathed deeply, trying to keep her composure in front of Rio's sad eyes. “Goodbye, Rio.” She tried her best for her voice not to shake. </p><p>“Good bye,Agatha.” She felt like vomiting. </p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, feeling her own heart breaking for this woman she only knew for a week. She pulled Rio in for one last hug, rocking them softly side to side for long seconds, camouflaged on a crowd of so many goodbyes. </p><p>Rio gulped, feeling like she needed to say something. “I didn't expect for all of this to happen, I just wanted an escape.” She sighed, trembling. “But I'm glad it did.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip,her heart beating faster with anxiety and something else. “Me too.” She finally admitted. “I think this was what I needed.</p><p><em>You are what I needed</em>. She wanted to say.</p><p>Rio blinked slowly and Agatha knew that she was going to say something to throw her world off her axis. That she would ask Agatha for something impossible.</p><p>“Agatha, we can…” The tears slipped from her eyes unannounced. “We can try.” </p><p>The other woman shook her head, feeling her own tears press the back of her eyes. “No, Rio.” She laughed unhumorously . “We can’t.”</p><p>Rio’s crying became more desperate, her cheeks going red as she let out a sob. “I don't care if it's a secret. I just wanna be with you.” Her body shook with the uncontrollable sobs that came after, she felt hopeless.</p><p>Agatha hugged her again. “Rio, you’re free and you're fearless.” She said in her ear. “Go enjoy that, enjoy your life.” She held Rio's face, looking into her wet eyes and eyelashes. “You deserve the best and I'm so sorry that anyone made you feel otherwise.”</p><p>Rio nodded, controlling herself not to scream sadly when Agatha kissed her forehead and let her go. How could this feel worse than her imminent divorce?</p><p>“Take care of yourself.” Agatha said, feeling her heart so small and hating everything in the world. Especially when the last call for Rio's flight was made.</p><p>“You too.” Rio whispered without force, making an unknown effort to turn her back at Agatha and walk up to her gate. She turned around and saw Agatha standing on the same spot, exchanging a sad wave with her.</p><p>When she sat on the plane and picked up her phone, she realized that Agatha's number already had her blocked.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>July, 2023.</strong>
</p><p>The Puerto Rican Sun actually felt like it burned hotter than Greece’s. </p><p>That’s all Rio could think as she walked around Old San Juan. Well, this and the headline “Former governor Agatha Harkness and her vacation plans before the Senate's campaign.” </p><p>She had offered an incense to the Moon in the last few nights, feeling stupid and hopeful in the same measure.</p><p>But, when she caught sight of long dark hair standing at a shop’s entrance, her stomach turned in anxiety. When a familiar face turned at her and smiled, her faith was restored. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><strong>January,2025</strong>.</p><p>Agatha sat down, tired but incredibly satisfied in her new office.</p><p>Finally, the senate election was won and her inauguration ceremony happened.</p><p>She looked at the TV that broadcasted the local Massachusetts’ news about the new government, including the governor that had taken her former office.</p><p>Agatha groaned with it, feeling nauseous with Jennifer Kale’s smile on her screen along with her first lady. The first queer woman to be elected as the state’s governor, waving proudly to the camera, lacing her wife’s waist with the other arm.</p><p>That bitch. </p><p>In all honesty, Agatha knew that what soured her the most was the fact that Jennifer was brave enough to do what she never was. Brave enough to come out, get married and win an election whereas all Agatha managed to do to remain even a little bit true to herself was divorce Ralph under wraps in the Fall of 2023 and only allow it to come to public when she had won. </p><p>And, she was pissed. Pissed because all the importance she gave to winning caused her to lose Rio, and Jen’s acceptance made her feel like it all had been in vain. </p><p>The last time they managed to meet, in Puerto Rico, they were both so excited to try and recreate the magic of their short lived Grecian romance. But, once again, Agatha felt like she had ruined everything. Her campaign was just beginning and her work was non stop, receiving calls and e-mails all day. Rio tolerated for only one day and one night before calling it quits.</p><p><em>That's it, Agatha</em>. She had said, redoing her luggage in the discreet village the politician managed to arrange. <em>You're not in this as much as I am, you never were.</em></p><p>This infuriated Agatha, couldn't she see the effort she was making? </p><p><em>What!?</em> Agatha exclaimed angrily. <em>I'm doing my best! I have so much work to do and I risked everything for a guess that I would find you here.</em></p><p><em>Go live your fairytale, Agatha. I hope it is worth it</em>. Was the last thing Rio had ever said to her.</p><p>Now, sitting alone in her office, she wasn't really sure if it had been worth it.</p><p>She had won, of course, but it had cost so much. Ralph was living the good life with his new girlfriend and Nicholas, who had taken some time to process the divorce and his new family dynamic, was spending a few days with his father. While, since Rio, Agatha couldn't get going with anyone else, worried to pull another woman into this mess of a life. It would be useless, anyway. In two years, nothing and no one could come even close to emulate the way Rio Vidal made her feel. More than alone, she was lonely.</p><p>On top of it all, she was being sued. </p><p>The papers had been served to her just two days earlier by Lilia Calderu, a senior worker on the campaign manager team accusing her of being forced to work after hours two days in a row, causing extreme burnout syndrome. </p><p>Now, in the hopes of not making a great scandal after just starting as senator, Agatha was scrambling to settle on an indemnity agreement with Lilia. </p><p><em>You’ll be hearing from my lawyer</em>. Was what the woman said before walking out of the recent senator’s office.</p><p>Agatha relaxed against the chair, covering her eyes, exhausted. She just wanted the day to end already.</p><p>Then, someone knocked at her door.</p><p>She sighed tiredly and it sounded more like a groan. “Come in.” </p><p>The door creaked open and her eyes snapped open in surprise when she heard a more than familiar voice. “Well, you were right about needing to be careful with me.”</p><p>Her mouth gaped open automatically with the sight of Rio Vidal standing on her office's door. </p><p>Her hair was a bit longer and her almond eyes hid under sunglasses, but she looked stunning as always. Agatha's heart skipped a beat, not believing what was right in front of her.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>?” She breathed out, her hands shaking. “You're here?”</p><p>Agatha was afraid that maybe she missed Rio so much that she was actually in a very vivid dream her own mind crafted to fill the void. It wouldn't be the first time.</p><p>Rio chuckled wickedly, walking forward and leaving no doubt as the scent of her perfume engulfed Agatha, who sighed with it. How could it be?</p><p>“My services were needed here.” Rio said, like she had read the politician’s mind. “I’m Mrs.Calderu’s lawyer” </p><p>She announced, sitting on the other side of Agatha's desk with confidence, placing her bag on top of it. The other woman watched all of it amazed, her brain scrambling to connect the dots. </p><p>“I hear you’re proposing an indemnity?" The lawyer asked, playing with Agatha. </p><p>Rio couldn't believe it when her mother sent her the message a few short weeks ago, saying that a long time friend of hers was in need of a Labor’ Lawyer to sue her boss, a newly elected senator in Massachusetts called Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She scoffed at it, her mind rushing. She remembered how much she suffered when they first parted, how she signed her own divorce papers heartbroken for a woman who wasn't her ex-wife. </p><p>Then, how happy she was when Agatha reunited with her a year later just so they could end up in a fight that Rio was sure would keep them apart forever. Her feelings for Agatha wore strong, of course, but she wouldn't let herself be played with to amuse the politician. Not anymore. </p><p>This was her revenge. Her revenge on the woman that made it impossible for her to fall in love with anyone else in years, surviving on casual flings. Her chance to get a payback and come out on top.</p><p>And, if she flew all the way to Boston with a tiny bit of expectation that they would end up making out in the end, it was no one's business but her own. </p><p>Rio took her glasses off, calmly folding its arms and placing them on top of the desk, staring deeply into Agatha's blue eyes, challenging. </p><p>“So?” She asked, arching one brow and crossing her arms. “What do you propose, senator?” The woman knew her posture was far from professional, but it delighted her so much to see Agatha flushed and disoriented. </p><p>“Uh…I…” Agatha seemed to finally get back to herself, fumbling with a few unimportant papers in her desk. She stilled and chuckled nervously. “Sorry. This is so unexpected. What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, as if the situation was completely normal. “In a few words, Mrs.Calderu is a very dear friend of my mother from her college days. She was in need of a lawyer, so here I am.” </p><p>“Oh.” A beat and Agatha frowned. “So you're suing me?”</p><p>The other woman shrugged. “Technically Mrs.Calderu is suing you, I'm just her representative.” </p><p>Agatha's mouth was slacked open. “I see. Is this your way to get back on me?”</p><p>Rio held a smile. Of course she would know. “I'm just doing my job.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at Rio, falling willingly onto her game. “Of course you are.” She adjusted on the chair. “Yes, i would like to atone Mrs.Calderu for all the hardships she encountered while working on the Senate’s campaign. Physical and psychological. And I would like it to be quick.”</p><p>Rio worried her lip between her teeth, Agatha tried her best not to stare. “Can't risk your perfect reputation, can you?” </p><p>They stared at each other for a second,the air heavy between them, Rio’s fingers drumming on the chair armrest.</p><p>“Ok, then.” She exclaimed suddenly,getting up and picking her bag up. “I will discuss it with Mrs.Calderu tonight and by tomorrow, if everything goes well, you can sign the papers.”</p><p>“That's it?” Agatha asked, confused with Rio’s sudden motion to leave. </p><p>“Yes, quick and painless. Just like you wanted.” She strutted to the door and turned around. “Oh, and i'm sorry about the divorce.”</p><p>Rio smiled and put her sunglasses back on, walking out of the office and leaving Agatha behind with a turning stomach and quickened heart.</p><p>                                    ________</p><p>“Senator Harkness?” A young intern asked after a knock on the door, catching the attention of the woman and the makeup and hair team that worked on her. “Mrs.Calderu lawyer is here, can i let her in?”</p><p>Agatha's hands trambled with her words , sending a look for the team. “Would you guys mind finishing it later?”</p><p>They gathered their stuff and headed out, leaving Agatha with an unfinished makeup and one single curler on the top of her head. </p><p>“Forty minutes to the broadcast, Senator.” The girl said before closing the door behind her.</p><p>Today, she would go live to give a speech about the prospects of her future as Senator, as well as her goals and plans. </p><p>The door creaked open again and Rio Vidal stepped in looking like the cover of Variety magazine in a sophisticated white envelope dress that seemed perfectly fitting for a lawyer. She carried a suitcase that she placed on Agatha's desk without ceremony, opening it and revealing the agreement documents.</p><p>“Mrs.Calderu agreed to your proposition.” She announced, putting the papers in front of her. “She's asking for the total amount of thirty-thousand dollars to cover therapy and medical bills, a vacation to decompress as well.”</p><p>"Good evening to you too,Rio.” Agatha said, picking the papers up and ignoring the shiver up her spine when their fingers brushed. It was still so surreal to have Rio there. “That I can do. Honestly, I was expecting way more.”</p><p>She reached for her favorite pen and signed on the designated spaces after running her eyes through the words, just to make sure she wasn't being scammed. She trusted Rio’s, even due to the circumstances. </p><p>“There you go.” Agatha handed the papers back with feigned nonchalantness. Two could play this game. </p><p>Rio picked it up and shoved into her suitcase, unsure with what to do next. What was she expecting? For Agatha to fall at her feet and beg her for another chance? </p><p>“Alright then.” She said, offering Agatha a handshake. “All settled now.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a side smile that was nothing short of wicked, her blue eyes shining. Rio almost sighed with how stunning she looked tucked inside a cream suit set. </p><p>She had never seen Agatha working and she couldn't lie, it was <em>hot</em>. </p><p>The woman grabbed her hand and shook it lightly, holding it more seconds than necessary and using it to elevate herself out of the chair. She dropped her hand and circled the table, making Rio's breath hitch when she stopped in front of her, so close that she could feel the fabric of her shirt brushing against the front of her dress.</p><p>“Did you really flew all the way here from New York just to torment me?” The senator teased, playing with one strand of Rio's hair.</p><p>Rio breathed deeply, trying to keep herself composed. “I told you, i’m-”</p><p>“Doing your job,yes.” Agatha rolled her eyes, stepping closer and launching her arms to the desk, trapping Rio’s hips between them, their faces so close that their breathing mixed. “I admire you, Rio. Coming all the way here when <em>you</em> were the one to break us apart.” </p><p>Rio scoffed, her chest touching against Agatha's and an inhuman effort to not look at her lips. “You think so high of yourself, Agatha.” </p><p>“Come on.” She whispered, leaning a bit forward. “You love it. Do you really want to go back to New York with nothing?”</p><p>The moment approached, the one they knew would be inevitable. The hidden truth that one way or another, they would cave to each other. </p><p>Rio pushed her cheek with her tongue, treading her fingers on the belthoop of both sides of Agatha's pants and pulling her closer, making them both sigh with the subtle contact. </p><p>“You just love to tease, don't you?” She ran her nose up Agatha's neck, making the woman automatically drop her head sideways and hum softly. “But I bet your panties are all wet down there.”</p><p> “I assure you they’re not.” Agatha said back, grabbing Rio by the neck and pulling her forward to whisper in her ear. “Because I'm not wearing any.” </p><p>Agatha's smug smile was still on her face when Rio finally kissed her. </p><p>It was hot and nervesearing, filled with the passion they could at last spill onto the other. Their tongues met frantically, their hands grabbing and squeezing everywhere they could. </p><p>The senator promptly grabbed Rio by the waist and pulled her up until she was sitting on the desk, knocking a few papers and decorations down so she could open her legs and accommodate Agatha between them.</p><p>Agatha wasted no time, latching her mouth on Rio's neck on a constant suction while her hand slid up the white dress, pulling her wet underwear to the side and filling the woman with two fingers.</p><p>“Oh!” Rio moaned loudly, holding Agatha by the shoulders as she started to fuck into her, throwing her hips up to match the pace. “Oh God!” She hugged Agatha's waist with her legs, pulling her even closer, whimpering when she paced faster and started to massage her clit with her thumb. “I missed you.”</p><p>She buried her face on Agatha's neck, moaning continually, turned on by Agatha's soft whimpers of effort and pleasure by seeing Rio like this. </p><p>“I missed you too.” Agatha confessed in her ear, fucking Rio slow now with a come hitter motion that made her pant in pleasure, pulling her closer and pressing their chests together, her walls clenching around the digits.</p><p>Rio came with a whimper, throwing her head back as Agatha drew it out longer and longer, prolongating the pleasure that made her eyes shut with the intensity of it, she kissed Agatha's neck, jaw, cheek, impossibly warm and dazed out by the atmosphere and Agatha's perfume. </p><p>She sighed with the feel of her fingers slipping out and Agatha holding her close, kissing her slowly and soft, their faces flushed red, Agatha's perfect makeup already messy. </p><p>“Come here.” Rio urged, jumping from the table with weakened legs and pushing Agatha on top of it in an exchange of power that the senator obliged without resistance. Not thinking about the fact this was her office as a political public figure.</p><p>She quickly opened Agatha's belt and pants, pulling it down to her knees and biting her lip to hold out a moan when she discovered that the woman was telling the truth about not wearing underwear. She was soaked. </p><p>Rio infiltrated between her legs, falling to her knees on the wood floor, bracketing her head between Agatha thighs and being squeezed by them when she licked a long strip on her cunt, hearing how loud she moaned.</p><p>The taste of it made her insane, shoving her face on her pussy and sucking it entirely on her mouth, what gained her a deep moan and Agatha's hand grabbing at her hair by the scalp, pulling her closer and circling her hips, grinding her warm center against the skilled tongue. </p><p>Agatha rode her tongue, panting and whimpering, holding Rio's head in place and using her mouth to her pleasure, the tongue traveling between her folds, the lips almost drinking from her. She orgasmed fast and suddenly, snapping her hips up and closing her thighs around Rio's head, almost making it impossible for her to breathe.</p><p>Rio felt suffocated between her legs, her head lightened. She loved it. </p><p>She pulled the lawyer up and kissed her again, guiding the motion with a strong hand on her jaw.</p><p>They locked eyes when their mouths parted, feeling the weight of their rejoining and the feelings that still burned bright despite time.</p><p>A knock on the door startled them. “Senator?” The intern asked from the other side.</p><p>“I'm busy!” Agatha exclaimed, rushing to buckle her pants again while Rio tried to organize her desk.</p><p>“The broadcast will start in five minutes, Senator. They need to finish your makeup.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, straightening her clothes and looking for Rio's approving nod before allowing them to come in. </p><p>The team stormed in to quickly retouch her makeup, seemingly ignoring how undone it was, the hairdressers snatching the single curler on the top of her head. </p><p>She looked embarrassed at Rio, her eyes saying “<em>Was it there this entire time?”</em></p><p>And Rio nodded, a playful smile on her face. </p><p>In just two minutes, she was sitting on her Senator's chair waiting for the call on her notebook to be made. The team left and her publicists team went in. </p><p>“I guess this is goodbye, Senator Harkness.” Rio said, catching her attention, the blue eyes fixed on her. “It was nice to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha's stomach turned monstrously, and she was sure of what she needed to do.</p><p>“I would like you to stay.” She said and Rio arched her brows. “At least until the end of the transmission.”</p><p>Both looked at the team, which nodded mindlessly at them. </p><p>The call started and Agatha followed the mind script she was used to, helped by a few cues on papers in front of her, basic things about her work, her upcoming projects and what she viewed for the next few years.</p><p>Finally, the opportunity she had been yearning for arrived. “Senator Harkness, what are your thoughts on the newly elected governor, Jennifer Kale? Do you expect her to continue the legacy you laid out for climate change and children's safety?” </p><p>Agatha controlled herself not to scoff. “I personally think Jennifer Kale was the best possible choice Massachusetts could’ve chosen, since i wasn't on the run anymore.” She laughed playfully, making the Interview laugh too and the publicist breathe deeply..”I do hope she continues to fight for awareness of climate change and work on projects to stop it. I also would hope that she turns a special attention to school safety, children's development in education and the protective laws towards them.” </p><p>Maybe, just maybe, she expected too much of the white haired old man asking the questions, that's what she got so surprised with what he said next. “Well, do you think it's possible? With the constant <em>agenda</em> she is trying to push to young children about sexuality. How can she keep that safe from them?”</p><p>She paused for a second, the room seeming heavy. She looked at Rio, who had been hiding against a wall all this time as stared back at her with a concerned, almost sad, face.</p><p>Agatha breathed deeply, turning her eyes back to the screen. “I actually don't see that agenda you're talking about. Governor Kale is a capable and smart woman who will be a great asset for the community, and happens to be married to another woman. In fact, i think her bravery can be inspiring to the population.” She swallowed thickly, it was time. “It certainly was inspiring to me.”</p><p>The whole room seemed to tense at the same second. She ignored the publicist whisper asking what she was doing, not being brave enough to look at Rio at that moment. “For the last few years, I hadn't been living authentically, partly because i was too scared to face people like you.” Agatha said in one breath, noticing the interviewer's surprised face, hearing the murmurs of the team in front of her. “Right now, i would like to thank Governor Kale for her courage and announce to the Massachusetts people that they didn't only elect the first queer governor of the state, they also elected the first queer senator.”</p><p>The murmurs grew and she exhaled, her hands shaking as the man on the other side of the screen say something she couldn't really understand, giving his goodbyes and ending the call.</p><p>Agatha looked at the corner where Rio used to be standing, furrowing her brows when she found it empty. Wasn't that what they needed to finally be together?</p><p>She jumped from the chair, ignoring the PR team as she passed through them, walking out of the office and down the hall, looking for Rio, looking for air.</p><p>She ended up in the garden, feeling it was possible to breathe again, putting her hand on her heart and inhaling deeply. </p><p>“That was really brave.” She turned around fast with the sound of Rio's voice. She was standing on the other end of the garden, hands behind her back.</p><p>“Why did you leave, then?” Agatha managed to breathe out, her hands were shaking. </p><p>“I got nervous.” She confessed, walking closer. “But I thought how much more nervous you were, so I got you this.”</p><p>She brought her hand forward, revealing a yellow flower with pink patches, holding it out for Agatha between her index and middle finger. “Congratulations, my love. What you did was amazing.” </p><p>Agatha smiled softly, relaxed, gathering the flower in her hands with care. </p><p>“You know, i’ve been thinking about moving for some time.” Rio said, lacing Agatha's neck with her arms. “There’s not really anything that holds me back to New York anymore.”</p><p>Agatha feigned a surprised expression, pulling her closer by the waist. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio said, caressing her arm. “Until then…Boston is not really that far from New York, is it?”</p><p>“No at all.” Agatha said back, smelling her perfume. “Especially by private plane.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Oh my, Governor! What about Earth?”</p><p>“What about it?” Agatha shrugged. “I think I have something I care about more now.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, amused, before kissing the smile Agatha had stamped on her face. </p>
