    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Rio knocked on the hotel door three times, suitcase in hand.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>No response. She knocked again, louder.</p><p>“Come on, everyone is waiting. We need to go, now!”</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Rio banged on the door with both hands, definitely waking up some of the other hotel guests enjoying a late morning in. Her rings were leaving faint scratches on the door. Surely their tour manager would pay for it; it was nothing compared to the damage Agatha had caused in some of the other hotels they’d stayed at.</p><p>“AGATHA! I swear to fuck, if you’re not out of that hotel room within the next minute, we’re leaving without y–”</p><p>The door opened. A young woman stepped out.</p><p>It wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>The woman quickly tiptoed past Rio, shoes in hand. The faint aroma of stale beer that clung to her t-shirt told Rio she was wearing the same clothes she wore last night. Her neck was littered with faint red marks. Hickeys. <em>How juvenile. </em></p><p>Agatha appeared in the doorway seconds later in just her t-shirt and underwear. A lazy smirk was lingering on her face as she watched the woman walk away.</p><p>“Hey, Sarah!” The woman turned around. “Give me a call if you’re ever at one of our other stops, alright?”</p><p>“My name’s Savannah.”</p><p>“Right. Savannah.” A beat. “So you’ll call, yeah?” Agatha flashed her a smile, winking as she did so. The woman – <em>Savannah, </em>apparently – fucking blushed. Rio was going to be sick.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll call, Agatha.”</p><p>“Good girl. See you around, doll.” And with that, she walked back into the hotel room, leaving Rio to trail behind her.</p><p>As much as Rio would like to say otherwise, this wasn’t the first time she caught Agatha with one of her hookups the morning after. Hell, it hadn’t even been the tenth. Matter of fact, with their national tour almost wrapping up, it was getting pretty close to the hundredth time this <em>exact</em> scenario had played out.</p><p>“Tell me you at least have your suitcase packed,” Rio said to Agatha, looking around the hotel room. To be fair, apart from the empty wine glasses and the informational booklets littering the floor next to the small desk in the room, it did look pretty clean. Rio tried very hard not to think about how those booklets ended up on the floor exactly.</p><p>“What do you take me for, some irresponsible hussy?” Agatha grinned at Rio, pointing to the suitcase waiting for her by the door. It looked about ready to burst, even though it was twice the size of Rio’s own suitcase, and she was pretty sure she saw some fabric caught in the zipper, but it was closed, at least.</p><p>While Agatha put on a faded pair of black jeans and some sneakers, Rio did a quick sweep of the room, checking to see if Agatha had forgotten anything important.</p><p>“Seems like you missed something.” Rio pointed to the panties lying by the side of the bed. She tried her best to look unimpressed.</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha looked over her shoulder, eyes following the direction Rio’s finger was pointing. “Oh.” She snatched the panties off the floor and dropped them in the trash can before turning back to Rio with a smile on her face. “They’re not mine.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. She shouldn’t care – she didn’t care – but still, something sharp and stupid twisted in her chest. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“Aw come on, don’t be jealous, baby. You know I only have eyes for you!”</p><p>“Just grab your stuff, the others have been waiting in the bus for at least half an hour now.”</p><p>Agatha slung her arms over Rio’s shoulders from behind, nuzzling into her. Rio, in spite of herself, immediately leaned into the warmth, into the feeling of Agatha’s breath on the back of her neck.</p><p>“Are you going to break up with me?” Agatha whispered conspiratorially, quietly laughing into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“You’re an idiot,” Rio said, but she couldn’t help but laugh too, already feeling her annoyance disappearing. “Just get your ass on the fucking bus.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>When Rio had joined The Coven two years ago, the band was fresh off the mild success of their first studio album. As an all-female rock bank they attracted quite a bit of attention, especially from a female audience. They’d built a small cult following, and critics had started to notice them when one of their singles ended up in the top 40.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, that was also the moment their drummer Wanda decided to leave the band. Their management never came out with an official statement, but Wanda’s not-so-subtle remarks to the press made it pretty clear Agatha had something to do with it.</p><p>Enter: Rio. She’d been drumming for a number of bands over the years, never really staying in one place for too long. One day, Lilia – the band’s percussionist – had scouted her when she was playing in a small venue in New York. The Coven had been in New York too, working on some of their new singles.</p><p>Lilia had invited Rio over to rehearse with the band one day, in a small but decently famous recording studio in Manhattan.</p><p>Rio remembered it well. She’d been nervous. She had auditioned for many different bands before, but not any quite as big as this one. She wanted to make a good impression.</p><p>When she walked into the little recording booth Lilia had told Rio to meet her at, the band was already there. She tried to catch Lilia’s attention, but before she could do so, someone stepped in behind her.</p><p>Suddenly, a sultry voice purred in her ear.</p><p>“Hello, doll. I’m Agatha. What’s your name?”</p><p>When Rio turned around, her eyes were met by one of the most gorgeous women she had ever seen. A woman that, by the way, was raking her eyes over Rio’s body shamelessly, tongue darting out to wet her lips.</p><p>Before Rio could respond, one of the other band members stepped in.</p><p>“Nope, we’re not doing this again. Agatha, <em>down</em>.”</p><p>Agatha held up her hands and walked back over to the mic, but not before winking at Rio.</p><p>“Ignore her, please,” the other woman had said. “I’m Jen, that’s Alice, and you’ve just met Agatha. You’re Rio, right? Lilia has been talking about you non-stop. You ready to play some music?”</p><p>Rio had played with the band the entire day and at the end of it, Lilia asked her to come back to next day too. And then the next. And the next. By the end of the week, Rio was offered a contract to be the new official drummer of The Coven.</p><p>To Rio, it felt like a dream.</p><p>A few months later, when they were getting ready to leave for their first national tour, it felt more like – well, still like a dream, if she was honest. Just with some unexpected… side-effects.</p><p>Rio got on well with the band. She especially liked Lilia, who was their oldest member. She was slightly weird, but she had great intuition, always knowing exactly what the band needed at the exact time they needed it. Jen and Alice were cool too. Alice, the band’s pianist, was a bit closed off but an absolute sweetheart once you got to know her. She was usually the person Rio ran to right after a show when she needed to destress. And once she’d managed to break through Jen’s prickly exterior, Rio knew she’d have a friend for life in the guitarist.</p><p>The only problem was Agatha.</p><p>Once Rio became an official member of the band, the flirting had stopped. Well, the <em>deliberate </em>flirting, at least. It seemed that Agatha wasn’t able to have an interaction with another woman without flirting at least a little. Rio quickly learned that her bandmates had gotten used to her behavior by now – or in Jen’s case, had explicitly told Agatha to stop unless she wanted her vocal cords to be cut in half while she was sleeping. But Rio still got slightly flustered every time Agatha purred something utterly filthy in her ear, or let her hands linger just a little too long.</p><p>When she first started actually performing with the band, Rio was struck by how mesmerizing their lead singer was. And fine, yeah, anyone with eyes could see that Agatha was hot. Smoking, actually. Her long, unruly dark hair and ocean blue eyes were hard to miss. But besides all that, she was a fantastic performer too. She wasn’t just a good singer, no: when Agatha got up on that stage, she <em>commanded</em> it. You couldn’t help but let your eyes follow her. Rio saw the magic up close every night, and she still got starstruck sometimes.</p><p>Agatha also had no problem playing her part as a rock legend in the making. In fact, she thrived on it. The late nights, the parties, the groupies, <em>the sex</em>. The other bandmates had warned Rio not to share a hotel wall with Agatha because they knew how loud she could get.</p><p>Still, Agatha knew how to bewitch an audience. And Rio would admit that for the first few weeks of playing on a stage together, she definitely felt <em>bewitched</em>. And while the feeling dampened the more time they spent together – Rio was a strict believer in <em>not</em> mixing work and pleasure – it never fully went away.</p><p>It didn’t take long for their audience to notice, either. While Agatha was taking a different girl home every night after a show, all the tabloids could write about were the charged looks Agatha and Rio shared on stage, or the photographs of them together where they were standing a little too close to just be friendly. </p><p>Rio hated it, hated being the center of attention. She wanted people to pay attention to the music she was making, not to her.</p><p>Agatha thought it was the funniest thing in the world. When Agatha had first suggested they’d play into it, Rio had scoffed.</p><p>“And give those paparazzi exactly what they want? Forget it.”</p><p>“Oh, come on!” Agatha was leafing through a gossip magazine, skimming one of the articles about them. “Don’t you think it’s funny to mislead them, to make them think they’ve figured us out while we’re laughing at them behind their backs?”</p><p>“Is that your actual reason, or do you just want to do it so your nightly sexcapades feel a little more taboo?”</p><p>“Why can’t it be both?”</p><p>It had only taken one look into Agatha’s twinkling eyes for Rio to give in.</p><p>So they started hamming it up on stage. They would let their looks linger a little more deliberately. Agatha would wink at Rio when she sang one of their lyrics about sex. Rio would twiddle her drumstick between fingers while holding eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>At the end of their shows, they did this bit where Agatha would drape herself over Rio’s lap, back bent over, belting out a high note as Rio continued to play the drums. When Agatha got back up, she’d press a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek before running back up center stage.</p><p>The crowd went wild every time, and the reporters ate it up. Then, after the show, Agatha would find one of the many groupies waiting for her at stage door and invite her over to the hotel they were staying at.</p><p>Rio would have a tea, or maybe smoke a joint with Alice.</p><p>Unlike Agatha, she was happy to leave her rockstar persona behind as soon as she left the stage. She was content. She was doing what she loved with people that she had grown to love as well. Even if Agatha relentlessly teased her about not enjoying her life of rock ‘n roll enough, she was happy.</p><p>When she got back to her hotel room after a show, she’d pack her bag so she wouldn’t have to do it all the next morning and read until she felt tired enough to fall asleep.</p><p>If she was staying in a room next to Agatha, she’d put on her headphones to drown out the sounds coming from the other side of the wall.</p><p>Most of the time, anyway.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Rio was walking through the backstage corridors, trying to find her dressing room. Even though the band left the stage twenty minutes ago, she could still hear the crowd singing and chanting. They had been electric tonight, and Rio still felt the adrenaline coursing through her body.</p><p>Alice had suggested ending the night with a celebratory smoke session – “To commemorate our best show yet,” she’d said – and Rio had immediately agreed. Jen had also said she’d to join, even though she usually preferred her vices in liquid form. Agatha was nowhere to be found, probably already telling some girl whose name she definitely didn’t remember how the view of the city from her hotel room was just <em>amazing</em> and she <em>had to</em> come check it out.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Rio would just grab her bag and the little baggie of weed from the dressing room she shared with Agatha, and then she’d be on her way too.</p><p>The door to the dressing room was half open and Rio almost stepped in without looking, shrugging off the leather vest that was too hot to wear on stage, but that their manager insisted worked well with her ‘brand’.</p><p>She would’ve barged in right away, hadn’t it been for the faint sound that caught her attention. Not a gasp, not a pained whimper.</p><p>
  <em>A moan. </em>
</p><p>Rio immediately halted her steps, looking up. There, she was met with the sight of Agatha pushed up against a wall, one leg wrapped around another woman’s waist while the other was barely holding her body up.</p><p>Rio barely had time to process what she was seeing when she heard another moan, louder. This time there was no mistaking it: it had come from Agatha. Her head was thrown back in pure bliss, fingers clawing its way into the other woman’s hair.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, right there, <em>faster</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was hammering in her chest. Her brain was telling her to turn around and run away, but her legs weren’t complying. It was like she couldn’t do anything but watch. Agatha’s hair was even wilder than usual. Her cheeks were stained red from exertion and sheer <em>lust</em>. She looked breathtaking.</p><p>Rio had walked in on Agatha in various states of undress before, but never like this, never in the middle of–</p><p>A rush of heat coursed through Rio’s body. Agatha’s whimpers were getting louder, and with great effort Rio managed to tear her eyes away from Agatha’s face to see the other woman pumping her fingers into Agatha in a steady rhythm.</p><p>“I need – God, <em>right there</em> – need more, need another finger, <em>fuck,</em>” Agatha moaned. Even though she was the one getting fucked, there was no doubt of who was the one in control in this little scenario. The woman complied immediately, following Agatha’s every command. Just like the crowd did when she was on stage.</p><p>Rio’s body reacted in spite of itself. All rational thought left her brain, blood rushing south and pooling between her thighs. All she could think about was Agatha, and what it would feel like to have her grind on her fingers instead. She couldn’t <em>stop</em> imagining it. Agatha, pressed up against her, panting, losing control…</p><p>Except, Agatha wouldn’t lose control, not really. She’d take it, try to hold onto it, just like she was doing now. And wouldn’t it just be delicious to try and break that control, even just a little?</p><p>At one particularly well-placed thrust, Agatha let out a sound that was somewhere between a whimper and a moan. It was filled with extasy, pure bliss as the nameless woman continued hitting that exact spot, making Agatha moan again and again.</p><p>She hated herself for watching – for wanting. But her feet were cemented to the floor, her body betraying her with every breath.</p><p>Rio whimpered.</p><p>Her eyes widened, hand flying to her mouth. The sound was small, barely audible. The woman currently thrusting her fingers into Agatha hadn’t heard anything, forehead resting on Agatha’s shoulder, never faltering her pace as she continued pumping into her with fervor.</p><p>Agatha, however?</p><p>She heard.</p><p>And her eyes were locked directly onto Rio’s, pupils dilated and mouth slightly ajar.</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped. She didn’t know what to do. All she could do was watch, looking into Agatha’s hooded eyes as she was brought closer and closer to orgasm. The fact that it clearly took Agatha great effort to keep up the eye contact only made the fiery pit in Rio’s stomach burn hotter.  </p><p>Then, in a moment that felt both two seconds and two hours long, Agatha leaned in closer to the woman’s ear, keeping her eyes locked onto Rio’s.</p><p>“Quick, before my girlfriend catches us,” she whispered, just loud enough for Rio to hear.</p><p>The word hit Rio in her chest. <em>Girlfriend</em>. It wasn’t real, couldn’t be real. It was just a lie cooked up for the press. But Agatha said it like a promise, a command, a <em>dare</em>. Rio’s thighs clenched, hands shaking. She felt raw, exposed, her heart beating in time with Agatha’s rapidly increasing moans.</p><p>It only took three more thrusts for Agatha to fall apart, her eyes staying locked onto Rio’s until she couldn’t bear it anymore, slowly fluttering shut as her orgasm overtook her completely. She rode it out on the woman’s fingers, squeezing every last drop of pleasure out of her. Rio didn’t tear her eyes away.</p><p>And then, as soon as it had begun, it was over. Agatha gave Rio one last look before focusing her eyes back on the woman who was slowly pulling her fingers out of her, the woman she had essentially used to get off while Rio watched.</p><p>Somewhere faint in the background, Rio heard someone calling her name, but she didn’t react, barely registering the sound. Her eyes were still stuck on Agatha, her heart racing. What just happened?</p><p>“Hey, Rio!”</p><p>Rio finally regained her motor functions, turning around to see Alice walking towards her, much closer than she expected. Suddenly, panic overtook her. She forced her legs to move, meeting Alice halfway down the hallway. She was moving in a blind panic. All she could think about was getting away from Agatha’s door.</p><p>“I wanted to head out, did you manage to grab your weed?”</p><p>“I, uh – no, couldn’t find it, sorry.”</p><p>“Man, bummer. I’m pretty sure I still have some leftover from last week, though. Wanna come back to my hotel room and smoke there?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah… let’s do that.”</p><p>“You alright? You’re like, way more high-strung than usual.”</p><p>“I’m good,” Rio lied, forcing a smile. Her hands were still shaking. “Let’s just– let’s go.”</p><p>It was only an hour and two joints later that Rio finally felt her heartrate slow down.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>It was almost time to go on stage and Rio was jittery. She’d drank too much coffee, a result of her barely getting any sleep last night. As soon as she closed her eyes she was brought back to the moment she shared with Agatha.</p><p>Maybe <em>shared </em>wasn’t the right word. Because essentially, Rio had walked in on what was supposed to be a private moment. And instead of turning away like a normal person, she’d just stood there and stared.</p><p>Even now she couldn’t get the image of Agatha – utterly blissed out and looking straight at Rio with those hooded blue eyes – out of her head. She felt herself grow warm every time it flashed across her mind. Rio already tried to get herself off that morning, trying to expel some of that restless energy, but every time she closed her eyes Agatha was <em>right there</em> and she’d stop, admonishing herself for even thinking of the lead singer.</p><p>The weed from last night had dulled the edges, but didn’t erase the memory. Agatha’s voice, slick with want, still clung to her skin. The heat between her legs refused to go away, and her mind was stuck on that look Agatha had given her. She wanted – no, needed – for it to have meant something, and wasn’t that just such a selfish thing to ask for?</p><p>Rio had avoided Agatha the entire day, making sure she was never alone with her. Agatha, for her part, had done everything in her power to rile Rio up further – or had she? Because, yes, Agatha had been standing close to Rio the entire time they were together, had purred filthy jokes in her ear, had rested her head on her shoulder while they were sitting on the backstage couch – but then again, she always did that.</p><p>Rio was just more aware of it now.</p><p>Aware of the way Agatha always seemed to run cold, warming her hands on Rio’s skin. The way her perfume clung to her, transferring to Rio’s hoodie when they were touching for too long. The way her voice never lost that low, teasing timbre that went straight to Rio’s core.</p><p>Soundcheck was a mess. When she missed her third cue during one of their most popular hits, Jen had to tell her to “Focus up, Vidal” before she ruined the entire set.</p><p>For what it was worth, Agatha also appeared to let up somewhat, not trying to catch Rio’s eyes nearly as often.</p><p>When it was time to go on stage, Rio was almost glad. She could just let herself get lost in the music for a while, leaving her thoughts behind.</p><p>She didn’t quite know how, but it worked. The Coven played brilliantly, and the crowd was amazing. Rio didn’t miss any cues. She finally felt herself regain some of the control she lost. She and Agatha still played up their fake relationship on stage, but it was so scripted into their shows that it didn’t feel more charged than usual.</p><p>Until they got to their last song, their most popular one. Agatha was going through their usual bit, draping herself over Rio’s lap while she belted out the lyrics.</p><p>But then, instead of kissing Rio’s cheek when she got up, as she usually did – something Rio had mentally prepared herself for before the show…</p><p>Agatha kissed her on her lips.</p><p>The contact was brief, no longer than a second, but for Rio, the world stopped turning. Agatha’s lips were soft, certain, full of intention. Rio froze. Agatha was already running back up the stage, towards the screaming crowd, but Rio couldn’t hear any of it over the pounding in her chest. Her lips tingled like they’d been burned.</p><p>Agatha was seemingly unaffected, already commanding the crowd’s full attention again as she sang the last verse of the song. The crowd sang along, completely oblivious to the turmoil currently wreaking havoc in Rio’s head.</p><p>When the song finished to loud applause, Rio walked off stage with the rest of the band in a daze. Alice gave Rio a weird look, like she was about to ask her if something was wrong, but she didn’t get a chance before they had to return to the stage for their encore. Rio tried her best to keep her head down, to focus on the music, and she miraculously got through it without missing any cues.</p><p>“Wanna come back to my hotel room later to chill?” Alice asked her when they finally got off stage.</p><p>“Nah, I think I’m just gonna have an early night in,” Rio answered, trying to sound nonchalant. She needed to be alone, to gather the thoughts swirling around in her head.</p><p>About half an hour later, her driver dropped her off at the hotel. Agatha had been nowhere to be found, their crew telling Rio that she’d already left. Rio didn’t even ask if she left alone. It wasn’t like it mattered, anyway. Right now, Agatha was probably telling some girl that she was special, already forgetting her name in the process.</p><p>All the while, Rio’s stomach was twisting itself into knots.</p><p>When she finally got up to her floor, Rio walked straight past her own hotel room. She was walking towards Agatha’s door before she knew why.</p><p>Rio brushed her hands through her hair before knocking on the door. She didn’t need Agatha to know how frazzled she felt. Not just yet, anyway.</p><p><em>Knock knock</em>.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>When Rio turned the doorknob, she was immediately met with the sight of Agatha: lying on her bed, once again wearing nothing more than a t-shirt and panties.</p><p>And suddenly, anger flared within Rio. Because how dare she look like that? Casual and half-dressed, like sex wasn’t still thick in the air between them. Like she didn’t know exactly what she was doing to Rio. Like Agatha trying to see how far she could push Rio until she – she’d what?</p><p>Rio shook her head, directing her anger towards the woman lying on the bed, looking at her with half-lidded eyes and a smirk on her face.</p><p>“Rio, I thought that’d be you! What brings you–”</p><p>“Cut the crap, Agatha. What the <em>fuck</em> was that on stage tonight?” Rio was seething, her voice harsh in the quiet hotel room. All the frustration she’d been feeling was seeping out of her.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Agatha replied in an innocent voice, but there was a glint in her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, fuck off. That kiss. Why did you do it?”</p><p>“Come on, don’t act like you didn’t enjoy it. Did you forget I saw you last night?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Had Agatha been thinking about it too?</p><p>“That isn’t– Look, I’m sorry about what happened, it was completely inappropriate and I should’ve talked to you about it, but… You can’t just toy with people’s emotions like that!”</p><p>Agatha regarded her for a moment, and Rio could see her eyes soften just a bit.</p><p>“And what if I wasn’t?” Agatha said.</p><p>“Wasn’t what?”</p><p>“Just toying with you.” Agatha slowly let her legs fall open, showing the small dark spot on the gusset of her underwear.</p><p>Rio's mouth went dry. Something low and hungry clenched in her stomach. Heat flooded her so fast it made her dizzy.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about it, you know. About last night.” Agatha’s fingers were starting to move up her torso, slipping under her top until she was cupping her breasts.</p><p>Rio let out a small breath. Her legs started moving of their own accord, walking towards Agatha.</p><p>“Been thinking about your fingers,” Agatha continued. “About how good they’d feel filling me up. I almost brought a girl back to this hotel room with me but I didn’t. You know why?”</p><p>Rio was now standing at the foot of the bed, so, so close to where Agatha was lying. She shook her head, entranced. Her head was still swirling with thoughts, anger slowly being taken over by plain desire.</p><p>Agatha leaned up, her head now level with Rio’s stomach. She was peering up at Rio with dilated pupils.</p><p>“Because I preferred the idea of getting off to just the thought of you.”</p><p>Rio’s world stopped turning. All the feelings she’d repressed over the course of the past two years came rushing back. Her knees were wobbling, fingers twitching at her sides. Anger was once again bubbling beneath her surface.</p><p>When she stayed quiet for too long, Agatha’s teasing continued.</p><p>“Cat got your tongue?” Her fingers were moving down again, grazing the fabric of her panties almost lazily, like she wasn’t fully aware of what she was doing. Like she wasn’t <em>ruining</em> Rio with every movement.</p><p>“Agatha, you can’t do this.” Rio’s voice was hoarse, desperate even to her own ears.</p><p>“Do what?” Agatha purred, faux-innocently. She stretched herself out languidly, arching her back and dragging her fingers up and down the front of her panties again.</p><p>“Being <em>cruel</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, baby, I’m not being cruel. If I were cruel, I’d be fucking some other girl right now, hoping you’d hear me through our shared hotel wall.” Agatha was crawling to the edge of the bed again, legs now on either side of Rio’s, who was still standing there clenching her fists. “But instead, I’ve been lying here, waiting for you to gather your nerves and storm in here, like you’d been dying to do all day.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. Her throat was dry. “You think you’ve got me all figured out. You think you’re in control.”</p><p>“I <em>am</em> in control. And you’re dying to give in. I can see it in your eyes, you know.” Agatha moved her legs, essentially caging Rio in. She could feel the heat radiating from Agatha through the fabric of her jeans. “I can tell you’ve been thinking about it. How I’d feel, wrapped around your fingers. Or maybe you want to be on your knees. Would that make it easier for you? If I’d tell you what to do?”</p><p>Rio shivered. Her whole body was trembling with need, reacting to the words leaving Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>But something twisted in her gut. Not just arousal. Defiance. <em>Hunger</em>.</p><p>She leaned down, hands placed on either side of Agatha’s stomach. Agatha immediately followed her movements, crawling back until Rio was towering over her.</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha’s eyes were gleaming. “Getting brave, are we?”</p><p>“Maybe I’m getting tired of letting you push me around,” Rio said, confidence slowly returning to her voice. Her thumb traced along Agatha’s jaw. “Maybe I want to see how you moan when you’re not the one in charge.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils blew wide.</p><p>And just like that, the balance started to shift.</p><p>Rio moved up the bed, kicking off her shoes in the process. She was guiding Agatha until she was lying right in the middle, spread out, Rio’s legs still between her thighs. A blush was slowly creeping up her chest, resting on her cheeks. Her breaths were coming in faster. Her eyes searched Rio’s face – still half-lidded, still smug, but there was something else beneath it now. Interest. Curiosity. <em>Surprise</em>.</p><p>It spurred Rio on to continue.</p><p>“You really think I haven’t noticed?” she whispered, bringing her mouth close to Agatha’s ear. “I was there, yesterday, remember? I saw the way you looked at me, too. The way you were begging me to touch you with your eyes.” Rio’s thumb was brushing Agatha’s bottom lip, dragging it down slightly. “I bet you’ve been thinking about how I’d feel inside of you just as much as I have.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught – a sharp, audible hitch.</p><p>“This little show you’re putting on for me? The panties, the looks, the kiss on stage?” Rio laughed under her breath. “You were <em>begging </em>me to come here.”</p><p>“I knew you would,” Agatha countered, defiant.</p><p>“Hm, you always think you know everything.” She leaned in again, tongue brushing against the shell of Agatha’s ear. Agatha whimpered. “So tell me, how did you imagine me? Did you get wet to the version of me that would just stare and blush, following your every instruction? Or did you imagine me like this? The version that knows exactly what you actually want, what you <em>need</em>?”</p><p>Agatha made a small noise, something halfway between a whimper and a scoff, and Rio felt a thrill shoot through her.</p><p>“Take off your shirt,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha hesitated. That was new.</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrow. “What’s wrong? You were dying to show yourself off just a second ago.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, but she reached down with trembling hands, lifting the shirt over her head. She threw it on the floor, somewhere next to the bed, forgotten. Her nipples were already hard. Rio had to stop herself from immediately leaning in for a taste.</p><p>She took her time letting her eyes roam over Agatha’s body, letting the silence stretch just long enough to make Agatha squirm. <em>God</em>, it was intoxicating to have Agatha like this – naked but not fragile, proud but just a little uncertain.</p><p>“You look good like this,” Rio murmured. “Still trying to pretend you’re not dying for me to touch you.”</p><p>“I’m not pretending anything,” Agatha said, but her voice was thin, unconvincing.</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio leaned in again, gently kissing Agatha’s lips. She was gone before Agatha could react, a recreation of the kiss they shared on stage. Agatha followed Rio’s mouth with her own, but she was held back by Rio’s hand. “Say it.”</p><p>“Say what?” Agatha’s voice was breathy.</p><p>Rio kissed her again, on the edge of her jaw this time. “Tell me you’ve wanted this.”</p><p>“I think it’s pretty obvious what I want.”</p><p>“I want to hear you say it, baby.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio for a long moment. Her pride and lust were fighting an inner battle, but lust eventually won out.</p><p>“I want you.” Her voice was barely above a whisper. Her eyes were nearly black with desire.</p><p>“See, that wasn’t so hard,” Rio replied. And before Agatha could come up with a witty retort, she kissed her again.</p><p>The kiss wasn’t slow or gentle. It was harsh, a clash of tongue and teeth, and Agatha moaned into it. The feeling was heady. Rio could get lost in it. She licked into Agatha’s mouth and was immediately rewarded with another moan.</p><p>
  <em>“Rio…”</em>
</p><p>Oh, and wasn’t that just everything Rio had hoped for?</p><p>“God, I knew you’d be like this,” Rio murmured between kisses. “Knew you’d melt as soon as I gave you the slightest bit of attention.” Rio’s worries from earlier were entirely gone. All she could think about was how responsive Agatha was, how good she felt beneath her.</p><p>They only separated when the need for air became too great. Rio continued moving her mouth down Agatha’s body, hovering over her taut nipples. Agatha’s chest was rising and falling rapidly, and she was looking at Rio through hooded eyes.</p><p>“C’mon, fucking touch me.”</p><p>Typical Agatha. Even now, lying on her back and completely at Rio’s mercy, she was still handing out orders. Like Rio was just something for her to control.</p><p>She’d play into it, for now. Rio lowered her lips down to Agatha’s chest, placing soft kisses across it and gently sucking on her nipple. Rio could feel Agatha relax, pushing her chest further into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, just like that.”</p><p><em>Good</em>. Rio wanted her relaxed for the next part. When she moved her head down again, Rio grazed her teeth over Agatha’s nipple. It wasn’t hard enough to feel like a bite, but it wasn’t gentle either.</p><p>“<em>Ah</em>,” Agatha moaned, moving away at the unexpected contact. Before Agatha could move away too much, Rio moved back again, sucking hard at the upper flesh of Agatha’s breast.</p><p>“Rio, <em>fuck!</em>” Agatha yelled, but not before Rio repeated the process again on a different part of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Too harsh, baby?” Rio asked, her right hand moving downwards while her left hand was cupping Agatha’s breast, soothing the red marks with her soft touches, distracting her from the pain.</p><p>Right before Agatha could complain, she swiped her fingers through Agatha’s folds. Agatha’s hips bucked.</p><p>“…N-no, keep going.”</p><p>“Hm, thought so,” Rio mused between kisses and bites, gathering Agatha’s slick on her fingers. “See, I think you quite like getting treated like this. As long as you’re getting your pleasure out of it, right?”</p><p>Rio could see a shiver run through Agatha’s body, telling her she was right. She swiped her thumb across Agatha’s clit. Her hips bucked again.</p><p>“What do you want, Agatha? Just say it and I might give it to you.”</p><p>“Want you naked.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected that. She’d expected Agatha to be selfish, to ask her for her fingers, fast and hard. Rio quickly shrugged off her shirt and pants, dropping them on the pile with the rest of their clothes. She caught Agatha’s whimper when she revealed she wasn’t wearing a bra. Her eyes were glued to Rio’s chest, biting her lower lip.</p><p>Rio went to pull off her underwear, but suddenly Agatha’s hands stopped her. She was looking up at Rio with pleading eyes.</p><p>“Please?” Agatha’s voice was small, barely audible, but Rio heard her clearly. Agatha was <em>begging </em>for her. To touch her. Rio’s control momentarily faltered and she could only nod. Agatha slowly pulled of her underwear, staring at her reverently. When Agatha revealed the glistening curls above Rio’s cunt, she gasped.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>Rio didn’t let her finish her thought, capturing her lips in another searing kiss. Her right hand immediately resumed the path it was on before it was interrupted, ghosting over Agatha’s dripping core once again.</p><p>Agatha arched into it.</p><p>“<em>Fucking</em>– touch me, Rio, <em>now</em>,” Agatha rasped, and Rio couldn’t find it in herself to deny Agatha any longer. She stroked her fingers through Agatha’s folds one more time, coating them in her slick before moving them inside of her wet, hot heat. Agatha moaned, clenching down on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>She set a slow, brutal pace, working Agatha up slowly. “Look at you,” Rio started babbling. “So ready for me, ready to take my fingers. <em>Fuck</em>, I wish we were in my room, bet you could take my strap in one go with how fucking wet you are.” Agatha let out a choked sound, something between a whimper and a moan.</p><p>“Don’t act like this isn’t exactly – <em>ah fuck, right there</em> – exactly what you’ve wanted for months.” Agatha was moving in time with Rio’s thrusts, clenching down every time her fingers drove into her. She was quickly losing control, Rio could tell. Her movements were becoming erratic, hips moving up with every thrust. “Don’t fucking stop, go <em>faster</em>,” Agatha whined.</p><p>Instead of listening, Rio slowed down her fingers.</p><p>“No no no, fuck, come<em> on</em>, Rio, <em>move</em>.” Rio could see tears forming at the corners of Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“I will, baby, you just have to ask.”</p><p>“Move faster, <em>now</em>.” Rio picked up her pace again, careful not to go too fast. Agatha’s eyes rolled to the back of her head. Rio started curling her fingers, touching that spot inside of her she knew would make Agatha scream. But right before she could fall apart, Rio stopped again.</p><p>“Rio, come <em>on</em>.” The words came out like a sob.</p><p>“Like I said, all you have to do is ask.”</p><p>Agatha was about to start demanding Rio touch her again when realization of what Rio was asking finally dawned on her. Rio grinned. She could see both sides of Agatha at war within herself, fighting for control. Then, she heard a small voice.</p><p>“Rio, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>“Knew you’d get there, baby.” And with that, Rio started moving with renewed fervor, curling her fingers on every thrust. She kept her palm on Agatha clit, giving her something to rub against while Rio’s fingers pushed deeper. Her mouth was peppering kisses across Agatha’s chest, her jaw, her mouth. Agatha was past trying to respond, her entire body strung tight with need.</p><p>Filthy noises were filling the hotel room, reminding Rio of all the times she’d pretended not to listen as Agatha was getting thoroughly fucked on the other side of their shared hotel wall. Hearing the gasps and moans she’d only ever heard through the thick barrier of a wall in real life was a different experience. Agatha was so <em>responsive</em>, writhing beneath her, moving into Rio with every touch. </p><p>And then, with one final curl of Rio’s fingers, Agatha’s orgasm crashed over her. Her walls clenched around Rio over and over again while she let Agatha ride out the waves of her orgasm. Rio worked her through it, until the sensations got to be too overwhelming.</p><p>When Rio finally pulled her fingers free, they glistened. Agatha’s eyes had fluttered open, watching Rio’s every move. Rio slowly brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked them clean, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>Agatha was still trying to catch her breath, dazed, pupils blown wide. “Holy <em>fuck.</em>”</p><p>Rio leaned in, lips brushing against Agatha’s. Agatha opened up for her, deepening the kiss immediately. </p><p>“Mmm, I taste amazing on your lips,” Agatha said, grinning. Before Rio could respond, Agatha continued. “Wanna know what you taste like on mine.” The hand that had found its way into Agatha’s hair tightened at her words. Then, in one smooth move, Agatha rolled them over, her body now on top of Rio’s, her thigh finding its place between Rio’s own. Rio bucked her hips before she could stop herself. </p><p>“Desperation looks good on you, baby,” Agatha teased, flexing the muscles of her thigh, pushing against Rio’s core again. Rio let out a weak moan. Agatha started moving downwards, peppering kisses all across Rio’s chest, a gentle repetition of what Rio had done to her earlier. She barely made time to stop at Rio’s breasts before moving further downward.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m the one that’s desperate here.” Rio breathed out a laugh. She didn’t stop Agatha though, just let her move further down. Let her <em>want</em>. Her mouth found its way to the top of Rio’s thighs, mouthing at the soft flesh there. Rio rolled her hips, dragging a small whine from Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“God, you’re <em>soaked</em>,” Agatha whispered against her, reverent. “You’ve been wet for me all day, haven’t you?” Her words were said between kisses, like she couldn’t bear to separate herself from Rio’s skin for too long.</p><p>Rio’s hand found its way into Agatha’s hair again, and when Agatha finally leaned in, her tongue was hot and eager and <em>perfect</em>. Rio’s hand was guiding her exactly where she wanted her, and Agatha responded with enthusiasm.</p><p>“Just like that,” Rio gasped. “<em>Fuck – </em>don’t stop.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t. She devoured Rio, licking and sucking like her life depended on it. She alternated between licking into Rio’s core and circling her tongue over Rio’s clit. Eventually her hands moved to Rio’s thighs, pulling her deeper, granting her better access.</p><p>Rio’s one hand was fisted into Agatha’s beautiful, unruly hair while the other was grabbing at the sheets below her, desperate for something to ground her. When she’d been touching Agatha, all of her focus had been on the other women, trying to draw as much pleasure from her as possible. Now that the attention was turned on her, all the feelings from the past day – from the past few years, if she was honest with herself – were coming back to her.</p><p>Her hips were grinding into Agatha’s mouth, chasing the high, <em>demanding</em> it. She looked down, locking eyes with Agatha, and the sight nearly undid her – those blue eyes blown wide and so goddamn <em>needy, </em>begging to please her.</p><p>Rio found her voice again.</p><p>“That’s it,” she breathed. “You love tasting me, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha moaned into her, the vibrations shooting straight through Rio’s core.</p><p>“God, you look so fucking perfect like this.”</p><p>Agatha doubled down, hands gripping Rio’s hips, pulling her closer, tongue fucking into her like she’d drown without it. Rio tried to hold on for longer, but she felt her orgasm quickly approaching. Agatha was eating her like she was starving, and the noises she was making were <em>filthy</em>.</p><p>Agatha licked into her again, nose pressing against Rio’s clit, and that was it – Rio’s whole body shuddered, orgasm crashing through her like a tidal wave. She cried out, the sound sharp and ragged, hips jerking as she rode it out against Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>When Rio finally felt like she could breathe again, she collapsed against the bed, legs trembling. Agatha followed her, crawling over her like a lazy cat, mouth shiny and looking utterly smug.</p><p>Rio let Agatha lie beside her for now, only for a moment, before grabbing her jaw and tilting her face up towards her own.</p><p>“We’re not nearly done here,” she hummed, voice low and full of promise.</p><p>Agatha could only smile, wicked and pleased.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Alice knocked on Agatha’s door three times, suitcase in hand.</p><p>“Agatha, are you there? The bus is waiting, we need to go.”</p><p>No response. She knocked again, louder.</p><p>“Come on, open up! I tried Rio’s earlier, she wasn’t answering either.”</p><p>No response again.</p><p>Before she could knock again, the door creaked open. A young woman stepped out.</p><p>It wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>It was Rio.</p><p>“Oh, Rio, I thought this was Agatha’s–”</p><p>But before Alice could finish her sentence, Agatha stepped out from behind Rio, smirk on her face.</p><p>It was only then that Alice could fully take in the image before her. Rio’s cheeks were flushed and she was holding her jeans in her arms. Meanwhile, Agatha couldn’t keep her hands to herself, grabbing at Rio’s hips. Her chest appeared to be littered with bruises. No, not bruises–</p><p>“WHAT THE FUCK, GUYS!” Alice yelled. She was definitely waking up some of the other hotel guests enjoying a late morning in.</p><p>“Sorry Alice, we’ll be down in ten,” Rio squeaked before rushing to her own hotel room.</p><p>“Make that twenty,” Agatha added before running after Rio, disappearing into the other hotel room.</p><p>Alice turned around, unwilling to deal with this bullshit so early in the morning. She walked back to the bus, where Jen was already waiting for her.</p><p>“So, are they coming?”</p><p>“Yeah, they’ll be here soon,” Alice replied, her mind elsewhere. “Hey, Jen?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Remind me I owe Lilia fifty bucks.”</p>
