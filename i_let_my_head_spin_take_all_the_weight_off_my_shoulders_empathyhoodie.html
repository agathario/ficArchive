<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>"I want this," She says, plainly, "And it's fine if you don't. I understand. But if you're only holding back because you think I'll regret it in the morning…" She trails off, racks her brain for something to soothe Rio's overworking brain with, "Rio, I'm green."</p>
<p>It takes a minute for Rio to answer—brain quite obviously cracking and sparking, but then, "You want this." They say in a way that sounds more like a realization sinking in than a question.</p>
<p>And so Agatha, just to make Rio laugh, tilts her head so she's not speaking into the mattress, "What's a little bondage between friends?"</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Rio's never tied anyone up before. For some reason, as their best friend, this means Agatha has to get involved.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>There are just some situations one doesn’t come to expect to be in with their best friend.</p><p>And this—Agatha face down on the center of her bed in a position she’s previously only ever found herself in during her twice weekly yoga class, while said best friend checks they can fit two fingers between rope and Agatha’s skin, in a tie she herself had instructed, is one of those situations.</p><p>But maybe Agatha’s getting ahead of herself. There was, of course, a build up to this. Agatha didn’t just strip and bend over for her best friend of fifteen years and demand to be tied up, but even still, if anyone had told her just last month that this is where she’d be, she wouldn’t have believed them.</p><p>It started, as most things do with them, in Agatha’s living room—a film they’ve seen countless times together playing as background noise for their conversation, and a bottle of wine split between them.</p><p>And Agatha’s trying very hard to be patient with all of Rio’s hesitance—and they <em>are</em> being hesitant, Agatha can tell—but that’s one trait she’s never been credited with having. Their wine is barely touched in their glass, lips remain unstained as, every so often, they let out a glum sigh, locked deep in their own head.</p><p>“Fucking hell, I can’t do this anymore.” Agatha says, shifts so she can put her wine glass down onto the ceramic coaster on the coffee table with a clink. Rio looks startled, eyes wide and like they’ve been caught doing something they shouldn’t.</p><p>“I’ve been zoning out again, haven’t I?” A sheepish look spills over their face.</p><p>“Well yeah, but you don’t normally look like you’ve been sent here to kill me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio laughs, taps a finger on the stem of their glass, “It’s not <em>quite</em> as difficult as that.”</p><p>Agatha gestures for them to explain—patience thinning. If it were anybody else, she’d have jumped down their throat the second the first sigh had left their lips. And though Rio maybe wouldn’t necessarily agree, Agatha reserves all of her gentleness for them.</p><p>Rio has enough gentle to extend to more than just Agatha, but Agatha’s greedy little heart is placated knowing she’s <em>first. She’s</em> the most important. The best friend.</p><p>“So what’s up?” Rio bats away her question with a hand and a shake of their head, “Rio, you know I won’t let this go. Yellow card has been issued, I can’t take it back now.”</p><p>“Aw, you did pay attention to the game." Rio grins and for some godforsaken reason finds the need to flick Agatha’s forehead. Agatha <em>did</em> pay attention—is always in the habit of paying attention to whatever Rio’s interested in, even if she doesn’t often let them see that.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject.” Agatha scowls, rubs the place where Rio’s finger made contact.</p><p>Rio must have thought they’d managed to escape questioning because their head drops to the back of the couch and they let out an agonized groan. It’s so very an Agatha sort of move that it amuses her to no end the idea of Rio’s subconscious latching onto her enough to replicate parts of her.</p><p>“You remember Maria, right?”</p><p>Remembers her. Loathes her. Yeah, she’d say that was about right.</p><p>Agatha only hums.</p><p>“She,” Rio gulps, more nervous than Agatha is used to seeing them, “She asked me to do something—”</p><p>“Oh, so <em>she’s</em> the one who sent you to kill me?” Agatha says, hopes to soothe Rio's nerves with a quip.</p><p>“Not that,” Rio says, not as placated by Agatha’s words as she’d hoped. They scrunch their eyes closed like saying it without letting any light in will help. And maybe it does because the words spill fast like they’re being pulled from their mouth, “She asked me to tie her up.”</p><p>Huh. Not Agatha’s first guess. Or even her tenth.</p><p>“Rio,” She starts, uses some of the gentleness from her <em>Rio supply,</em> “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Doesn’t matter how long you’ve been together—”</p><p>“It’s only been six months.” Rio interjects.</p><p>Jesus, fuck. Is that really all it’s been? Feels like years.</p><p>“Break up with her then.” Agatha throws her hands in the air, solution very much obvious to her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says in a tone that tells her they think she’s acting a little insane, “I just wanted some advice.”</p><p>“Advice.”</p><p>“Yeah, like,” Rio’s ears must burn with the color they’ve become, “You’ve done it before, right?”</p><p>“You haven’t?” Rio is her best friend. Agatha loves Rio. But Rio is enormously fun to mess with, and Agatha loves playing with her food, “Didn’t take you for someone so vanilla.”</p><p>Rio is the most fun to mess with because she knows exactly where their boundaries lie, can elicit some sides to Rio most others never see. Such is the benefit of knowing each other from when they were teens, because Rio deliciously bites back with an innocent smile plastered to their face, “Do you often think about me having sex?”</p><p>It takes a lot to stop Agatha in a run, and she’d applaud them if it didn’t mean admitting defeat. She thinks about it for a moment. Okay, so it’s maybe crossed her mind one or two times, but that’s only natural—to wonder who your friend is behind closed doors. So, in the interest of honesty, Agatha, with a shrug says, “Sometimes.” And watches as Rio chokes on the wine they’ve finally decided to have a sip of.</p><p>“Right, well,” Rio clears their throat, wipes their mouth on the sleeve of the well worn sweatshirt they keep in a drawer in Agatha’s bedroom, “Can you help me or not?”</p><p>Agatha huffs, smacks one of Rio’s legs, “I can’t believe I speculated my own murder by your hand and you brand that as only one step lower than dipping your toe into bondage.”</p><p>“Not one step,” Their ears still haven’t returned to their normal color, though they grin, “A few at the very least.”</p><p>“Oh, well that makes me feel so much better, thank you.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha sighs, “Can’t you just google it like everyone else?”</p><p>“I want to get it right,” Rio says, ever in pursuit of perfection and doing things properly, “You have experience. I know you do. What’s better than learning first hand?”</p><p>Agatha hums. Rio’s not wrong exactly. And it’s not like they don’t ever talk about sex. It’s like Rio said—they know she has experience. Is it different to teach them something they’ll use on their girlfriend?</p><p>Fuck, there has to be something wrong with Agatha for the only thing that abates the sickly feeling in her stomach to be the knowledge that she taught Rio this. That even when they use what she shows them on their girlfriend, it’ll be Agatha’s words they recall, Agatha’s hands tying the knots in their mind.</p><p>“I suppose you’re right to come to an expert.” Agatha says, flutters her eyes closed and flips her hair over her shoulder.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio shifts on the couch, digs their toes into Agatha’s side with a toothy grin and wiggles them, speaks over the embarrassing laughter they’ve managed to drag loose from her body, “I wasn’t aware I was in the presence of an <em>expert.”</em></p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha glowers, grabs hold of Rio’s ankle with a firm grip, “Or my instruction might have to be a little more physical.”</p><p>They stop the flailing of their leg, eyes getting a faraway look in them for just a moment before they shake whatever thought had just latched itself to their brain loose. Agatha doesn't want to get into whatever that is and so releases their ankle.</p><p>"I don't know why you don't just tell her you don't know what you're doing."</p><p>"Well, I—" Rio cuts themself off, grimaces, "It's embarrassing when she's done it before."</p><p>"Everyone has to start somewhere." Agatha shrugs, doesn't think poking any sort of fun at Rio will help here.</p><p>Rio pushes their tongue into their cheek and looks away. Clearly that's not all there is to it.</p><p>"Rio…" She doesn't want to have to start pulling teeth.</p><p>And luckily Rio's been on the receiving end of that before because they rub their hands over their face with a groan, and say—muffled, mouth to palm, "I might have told her I've done it before."</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>"Are you seriously telling me you wouldn't at all judge someone who didn't have any idea what they were doing?" Rio bursts out before she can say anything, "If they tried to tie you up and it like… came apart or something."</p><p>It's perhaps one of the more absurd things she's ever heard Rio say, "Hon, I don't do that." And at Rio's questioning hum, she sighs and says, "I do the tying."</p><p>"Oh," Rio says like this changes everything, "Every time?"</p><p>And Agatha pauses, <em>could</em> lie to Rio, say she's never tried it, that she isn't interested, but, "I've tried it. I don't like being restrained."</p><p>Rio picks at a nonexistent fray in the fabric of the sofa, "What don't you like about it?"</p><p>"I don't like feeling not in control," She chews on her tongue but ultimately can't stop herself from divulging more, "And you know I have no interest in dating, I'm not a person built for love. Anyone I've had some sort of arrangement with… I just—"</p><p>"You don't trust them?" Rio's eyes are wide like that's one of the more devastating things Agatha's ever told them.</p><p>"It's a different kind of trust," Agatha says evenly, wants Rio to understand exactly what she means, "Of course there's trust there. You need it. But I guess you're halfway right, I don't trust them the same way they trust me to do the same thing."</p><p>She smacks Rio's leg again in part to get their attention, but also because she's very much <em>done</em> with this conversation, and then stands, hands decisively on her hips and hopefully looking a lot more confident than she feels.</p><p>"Where are we going?"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "Do you think I keep my rope in the living room, do you?"</p><p>Agatha swears she sees Rio's throat bob when they swallow roughly. They stand, rub presumably sweaty palms on their jeans, "I should have had more of that wine."</p><p>"Nope," Agatha says, takes them by the arm and drags them to the stairs, "You need a clear head."</p><p>When they reach the top of the stairs, Rio, in a tone unheard by Agatha before says, "Why, what are you gonna do to me?"</p><p>Agatha slows as she reaches her bedroom, traces fingers across the dips in the wooden door, casts a glance over her shoulder at an eagerly nervous Rio, somehow giving the exact same energy as a dog about to learn a new trick. And in a way, they are.</p><p>"I'm gonna teach you a basic tie," She squints at Rio who's rocking back and forth from their toes to their heels, "What did you think I was gonna do? Tie you up?" She raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Well, I don't know!" The pitch in Rio's voice is somewhere in the ceiling when Agatha turns back around and leads them into her bedroom.</p><p>It's the wine, Agatha thinks when she crosses the room to her closet, and to the chest she keeps at the bottom, it's the wine that's forcing the image of Rio tied up and underneath…someone—someone less Agatha shaped, into her stupid brain.</p><p>She spends a little more time than she usually would here—faux rifling to find the soft rope her hands made contact with almost immediately. Usually, at this point she's with a partner—has them waiting by the bed, and her hands don't shake when she crosses the room to the closet.</p><p>It's just Rio, she reminds herself. It's just Rio and she's just helping out a friend.</p><p>"Do you <em>want</em> me to tie you up?" Agatha says, turns around, rope in hand, hopes to regain a little of the control with a tease, "Is that why you don't know what you're doing?"</p><p>Rio's eyes bug when she stalks back over to them, flickering between her and the lengths of deep purple rope she's holding, "I, um—"</p><p>"Prefer to be the one all tied up?"</p><p>"No," And this comes with a vigorous shake of their head, but then, "I don't know. I've never tried that either."</p><p>There's something in Agatha's chest—one might confuse this with her heart, but no, it's something else and it tightens to know they've come to Agatha over everyone and everything else.</p><p>"We'll start simple," She says, tease gone, pushes at Rio's shoulder with a single finger to get them to sit on the bed, and then elaborates, "A square knot."</p><p>Agatha passes a second length of rope to Rio, watches them rub the silky material between thumb and forefinger. It's strangely intimate to know the rope in Rio's hands is <em>hers</em>.</p><p>"Like in macramé?"</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>There must be a distinct look of <em>I have no idea what we're talking about</em> on her face for Rio to clarify, "The square knot."</p><p>"Fuck me," Agatha rubs her head, "I forgot about that particular hobby. When was that, the last year of high school?"</p><p>Rio hums and then starts to unravel the rope from the loose wrap Agatha had tied to store it.</p><p>It makes a little more sense to Agatha now—this is just the latest in a long line of hobbies Rio has tried out over the years. And like many of them—the aforementioned macramé, then tennis, pottery, chess, and tabletop gaming, and so on, have all been brought to <em>Agatha</em> specifically with an enthusiastic, <em>"Do you wanna try this with me?"</em></p><p>Of course this newest venture—a hobby they'll inevitably drop—has been brought to Agatha.</p><p>"No, <em>not</em> like in macramé."</p><p>It's a shame that none of Rio's hobbies have ever leaned nautical because they'd have been sure to have come across the basic square knot if they had. Agatha could have been saved the headache this is turning out to be—dizzy whenever she looks to Rio's careful hands and focused eyes wanting to get it right first time.</p><p>They don't rush, they listen to Agatha, and even though this is the bare basics, Agatha feels pride swell in her chest. Stupid, really. But they <em>do</em> get it. Agatha has never taught another person—has had no need since she herself learned; she's not planning on subbing for anyone else again.</p><p>She has to admit—<em>can</em> admit to herself and never aloud—that Rio is a far better student than she ever was. Likely because they actually want to <em>listen</em> and have the respect for the basics that Agatha never had at the beginning—first seeking to give the discomfort she felt being put in that position over anything else.</p><p>Stupid and dangerous. Things gentle Rio with their kind eyes and careful hands is not.</p><p>But after the fundamentals, and Agatha's talks and checks about safewords and aftercare, it's a little harder to teach Rio more than that without—well, either one being tied up.</p><p>And Agatha's prepared to leave it there. She is. Rio has the basics—can do the rest of the research themself.</p><p>But Rio says, <em>What next?</em> And the idea of leaving Rio with less information than they want—especially when she has it herself, is uncomfortable. Agatha thinks to the first time the opportunity was presented to her and she didn't have a clue what she was doing—embarrassing and anxiety inducing, doesn't want Rio to have the same experience.</p><p>The thought of Maria not being as understanding as say, she would be, is ultimately what makes her say, "Do you want me to teach you how to tie someone to the bed frame?" Because even if they admitted to Maria their limited experience, at least it wouldn't be a lie to say that they had <em>some.</em></p><p>As ever, Rio is keen to learn—and especially from Agatha. All of their past hobbies and interests have been things Agatha also doesn't have experience in and so they learn together. This is different.</p><p>"Am I—" Rio cuts their words off, licks their lips as they try to find the words, "Tying you up?"</p><p>And—oh. Agatha hadn't thought about that. But this is Rio. And they're not doing this for real.</p><p>"If you want." She shrugs, hopes to come off mostly aloof.</p><p>"Only if I'm not gonna make you feel uncomfortable." Rio is so earnest, their voice so soft it almost dips into a deep whisper at points.</p><p><em>You could never make me feel uncomfortable,</em> are the words that come to mind when she stares into Rio's eyes, which feels justifiably insane enough to <em>not</em> say them aloud. Instead, Agatha just nods, a slight smile on her lips—closed mouthed in case the too heavy words slip through the cracks.</p><p>And so she scoots up the bed, stays sat up as she talks Rio through first tying the rope safely around her right wrist.</p><p>Agatha pokes fun at Rio's tongue peeking through their teeth in their concentration, and it… feels <em>nice</em> when Rio chuckles, sticks their tongue in their cheek so as not to bite back. It's not scary, doesn't make her feel out of control, doesn't feel like Rio has become a whole different person in order to do this.</p><p>"Is this okay?" They ask, "Not too tight?"</p><p>"No." Agatha says, words heavy from how the wine must have caught up to her a little, <em>feels perfect,</em> she doesn't say.</p><p>And then, under Agatha's watchful eye, her steady instruction, they hitch her to the bed frame. Every new movement warrants a side eye glance towards Agatha, a wordless check in.</p><p>And she must have taught them well—not that she doubted it, what with Rio's eagerness under her own exceptional guidance.</p><p>"What about the other wrist?"</p><p>The words sit between them for a moment, Rio's dumbfounded expression not quite fitting the question. And it's then that Agatha realizes they were <em>her</em> words, in <em>her</em> tender tone.</p><p>Rio nods after a second and—<em>fuck—</em>Agatha could quite easily backtrack, play it off as a joke. But she doesn't find the panic that commonly bubbles up from the depths of her stomach when a partner who likes to switch asks a question in the same vein. So she doesn't take it back.</p><p>"What's your safeword?" It's throws her—has Agatha half thinking they're joking. Not a lot with Rio is a joke unless explicit.</p><p>Agatha laughs, "We're not doing this for real. We don't need one."</p><p>But Rio isn't mollified by her words, "You're the one who said having an established safeword was important for <em>any</em> level of bondage."</p><p>They're right—Agatha did say that, "But this isn't—" She cuts herself off with a harsh swallow, doesn't know why sharing this with Rio feels <em>bigger.</em></p><p>"Agatha," Rio leans towards her almost like they're going to bump their head into her like a cat would, "We don't have to do this. You could always do it on me, I'm sure I can learn that way."</p><p>It's tempting.</p><p>"Or you could tie me up after, if you wanted," Rio's big hand heavy but not stifling on her thigh, "Maybe something more complicated, and then we'll be even."</p><p>Agatha knows what they're doing—appealing to her ego, her love of performing. In layman's terms, she's a show-off.</p><p>"Purple." She says, eyes on the rope conveniently colored the same. She's not sure she's thinking when she says it. It's not her typical safeword. It feels <em>dirty</em> almost, to use the same word she uses for her hookups in a tame, <em>teaching</em> situation. It feels <em>wrong</em> to use the same word with <em>Rio.</em></p><p>"Purple." Rio nods, brings their hand up to run the tips of their fingers over the rope cuff around Agatha’s wrist, "Another color. Makes sense." They say, unaware that this is has been inadvertently chosen just for them.</p><p>"And you remember the traffic light system?"</p><p>"Green means everything is good and keep going. Yellow is slow down and check in. Red is to stop because you've hit your limit." Rio's hand shifts so from the rope so that they're holding Agatha's hand. Agatha closes her fingers around their palm.</p><p>"And if I say purple?"</p><p>"We stop play entirely." Rio says, no hesitation.</p><p><em>We</em> stop play entirely. She knows it's not what Rio meant but the implication sits heavy in Agatha's stomach. She thinks she can almost feel it curdling. <em>Is</em> it curdling?</p><p>Agatha nods, licks her lips and watches it play out in the mirror of Rio's own face—an accidental mimic.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Rio's quite ready to take initiative, so she tilts her head back, extends her left hand towards the bed post and says, a little like she's commanding a dog, "Rio, green."</p><p>It's this that snaps Rio into action. Agatha watches them swallow, nod once like they're building themself up. And then they take the second length of rope and methodically wrap Agatha's wrist.</p><p>"Feels strange." They say when they're making sure the rope is neat and flat against her skin.</p><p>"Do you not like it?" Agatha narrows her eyes, wishes she could get inside Rio's mind and walk the paths of their brain.</p><p>"Not that," Rio clarifies and then when they've finished their tie, looks to Agatha and says, "Color?"</p><p>There's no doubt, "Green."</p><p>And so Rio works on hitching her second wrist to the bed frame.</p><p>"Doing this with you."</p><p>Agatha hums, taken from her quiet mind at Rio's words. She racks her brain, "It's strange?" She says, eventually remembers Rio's words before.</p><p>"It's strange that it's <em>not</em> strange." They say, and then back away, eyes tracing over the wrist and then snap to the other one, admiring their handiwork.</p><p>Agatha bites her tongue when it comes to her agreement—doesn't want to get into thinking about why the fuck this isn't scary to her. Even more so when Rio says, "Did I do it right? Can you get out?" And Agatha pulls against her restraints, finds that she can't. Finds too, that her heart keeps its same rhythm following the realization.</p><p>She wordlessly shakes her head, even though Rio is watching her every move with the attention of an animal tracking prey.</p><p>"Now what?"</p><p>Agatha laughs, "I hope you don't have to ask that when you tie <em>her</em> up."</p><p>She enjoys the flush on Rio's cheeks at her words, "No, I—" They clear their throat, "I just didn't know if we were done. I know what I'd do if this was real," They say, then eyes go wide as saucers, "Not with you. I meant with—"</p><p>"Yeah, I know."</p><p>Agatha doesn't really need to be thinking about Maria right now. Not when she's allowed, for the first time in years, someone to tie her up. Doesn't need her steady vulnerability shaken up.</p><p>"Yeah, you could leave it here, with just the wrists," Agatha clears her throat, "Or you could do ankles too. It's up to you. The sex doesn't have to be much different just because your partner is restrained. You can do things you'd usually do and their senses will be heightened."</p><p>"That makes sense," Rio nods, "I guess I should—" And they nod towards a wrist.</p><p>Agatha wiggles her fingers in invitation and Rio carefully unties her, checks over each wrist when they're free, softly touches the skin where there are the faintest of marks.</p><p>"Do you want me to rub them?" They say, stare down at the skin.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, comes back to herself a little—can hear the film they'd been watching and had forgotten to turn off before coming upstairs. It's near the end, she thinks. The street sounds a little busier than usual—she can hear cars rolling past outside the window. All of this was lost to her before. Maybe <em>not</em> due to the wine then, but it's not something Agatha wants to think about right now.</p><p>"I'm gonna show you a more complicated tie, aren't I?" Agatha picks up one of the lengths of rope, enjoys the sharpening in her mind as she does, "I don't like to confuse my brain with aftercare mid session. You <em>can</em> though—if that's right for you."</p><p>Rio nods, lets Agatha's words sink in. Agatha likes that—how willing Rio is to learn, never trying to skip ahead. They're a natural, and if their girlfriend is more experienced, like Rio said, then she's going to have fun expanding on Rio's basic knowledge.</p><p>Agatha is maybe the only one who <em>won't</em> have fun—which is a strange thought to have. It <em>has</em> been a while since she did this with another person. Actually, it's been a while since she <em>fucked</em> someone else. She really needs to rectify that because she's starting to lose it a little.</p><p>"How do you want me, then?" They ask, ready for Agatha to do whatever.</p><p>"Can I tie your ankles to your thighs?" Agatha says, touches lightly to one of Rio's ankles, "It's one of my favorites."</p><p>Rio nods like they have nothing to think of, "Of course."</p><p>Agatha gathers her rope, "Can you kneel for me?"</p><p>Rio does, "Like this?"</p><p>Agatha looks them over, "On your toes, please." She says, taps the bottom of Rio's sock covered foot.</p><p>Rio huffs a laugh as they shift, rocking forward on their knees so that they can sit with their toes under them a little. Agatha gets halfway through murmuring her thanks when Rio says, grin evident just through their voice alone, "You're so polite."</p><p>Agatha scoffs, "I can be mean if you want," Swats Rio's thigh even though it's through the thick material of their pants, "A lot of people like that and I'm <em>very</em> good at it."</p><p>Agatha, facing Rio side on, gets the ego swelling view of her best friend's face reddening at her words—they probably <em>do</em> like a mean femme, if Agatha had to guess. Unfortunately, Agatha thinks, unfortunately they'd probably be compatible in bed.</p><p>She swallows that thought down. It must be leftover from whatever weird shit was going on in her mind when she was tied to her own headboard. Traitorous, fuzzy brained head demons.</p><p>She starts looping the rope around Rio's right thigh and ankle—the angle better now on Rio's slightly raised leg.</p><p>"No—I—I'm okay." Rio stammers even though their cheeks retain a lovely blush. Agatha shifts her eyes up for a second, just to catch how Rio watches her work, almost mesmerized.</p><p>"What are you thinking?" Agatha asks—almost doesn't when a sick little voice tells her Rio's thinking about how to do this on…<em>her.</em></p><p>"How good this would look against skin." Rio's voice comes out a little breathy, and Agatha doesn't know which is worse: thinking about Rio with their skin exposed, rope cutting patterns into it, or thinking about <em>Rio</em> thinking about <em>Maria</em> like that.</p><p>(Only one of those options leaves an acidic burning in her throat when she thinks of it, and worryingly it isn't the one where she's thinking of her naked best friend.)</p><p>She distracts herself with an affirmatory hum, even though she's not quite sure what she's agreeing with, and finishes off the tie on Rio's right thigh. She quickly moves round the bed to make a start on the other side when Rio gives an eager <em>green.</em></p><p>There's less talking on the second tie, and Agatha's experienced enough that it doesn't take long for both of Rio's legs to be properly bound.</p><p>They're staring down at themself with a look Agatha understandably has never seen on her friend, but recognizes as clear, unfiltered arousal. And maybe this <em>isn't</em> just about Maria after all. Agatha can't help the twitch of her lip.</p><p>Rio looks up then, catches Agatha watching them, narrows their eyes and then, to take focus from their face where they're sure to know Agatha's taking pleasure in staring at, they say, throat thick, "What position do you like when you do this?"</p><p>This feels like some sort of test. And Agatha is <em>good</em> at tests, which is handy because she doesn't like not being good at things right away. And that's why she has to pause—because what if she gets this wrong?</p><p>There's something in their eyes so <em>earnest</em> that the words, "Can I get you to move?" Come spilling from Agatha's lips before she's had chance to think it through.</p><p>But Rio is nodding like this is all perfectly normal, and so Agatha helps them to tip forward, ass up, chest near to the mattress, watches short nails bite into the skin at the tip of their thumbs.</p><p>"Clasp your forearms for me." Agatha says, would request something like this anyway, but if it gets Rio to stop anxiously digging into their skin then that's another win, "Color?" She asks, just to be sure.</p><p>Rio waits until they've done as Agatha asked before they give another <em>green.</em> They <em>do</em> look a little more relaxed now.</p><p>"Good," Agatha's heart thumps heavily in her chest—unique to just this one time with Rio, "Wouldn't want you touching when I haven't allowed it."</p><p>Agatha swears she hears a poorly held back whimper escape from Rio's lips, but she shakes the thought away.</p><p>"How does it feel?"</p><p>Rio clears their throat, shifts their hips as they think. Agatha isn't a patient person—wouldn't be this lenient with someone else, someone she doesn't care about. With Rio, she would wait forever.</p><p>(And if she happens to notice the stretch of Rio's jeans across their ass, happens to lean a little further back to appreciate it further, no one needs to know but her. She's never looked before, she <em>swears,</em> but there's no time like the present.)</p><p>"The tie is fine," They say eventually, sand-papery words, "Nice. I can see why people like it."</p><p>"But not you?" Agatha says, touches a hesitant hand to one of theirs, gripping hold of their own arm.</p><p>Again, Agatha is patient, doesn't ask again, doesn't force an answer. Fuck, is this what it's like when you <em>care</em> about someone?</p><p>"It's more the position."</p><p>Hm. There's a lot they don't talk about to do with their sex lives, so maybe this makes sense now that she's <em>allowed</em> to think about it. "Color?" She asks again.</p><p>From Rio's throat comes a tentative little noise.</p><p>"I won't be mad. It's important to be honest so we both have a good time," And then she realizes exactly what she's just said, "You and whoever you're doing this with, I mean."</p><p>Which is just a fantastic save said in such a normal, unwavering tone. It's just good that Rio is otherwise preoccupied with their own thoughts for now. "Color?" She prompts again, when Rio's had time to process her words.</p><p>This time, Rio's voice is sure, "Yellow."</p><p>"Can I change the position to have you on your back?"</p><p>"Yeah." Their voice is breathy, relief evident, and they let go of the grip they have of their own arms to push themself over.</p><p>"Better?"</p><p>"I think."</p><p>"You think?"</p><p>And in the spirit of the honesty Agatha's been promoting this evening, Rio rambles, "It depends what you're gonna do. I mean—not you, obviously. But like, if I was like this for someone else," They stop to briefly choke on their tongue, and still Agatha's patience persists, "I can't help but imagine something happening with me like this. So I'm green right now because we're not having sex, but maybe I'd be yellow if we were. I'd wanna know what you were gonna do to me."</p><p>Agatha knows the <em>you</em> doesn't actually mean her—she's not stupid, and so she chooses to ignore that for Rio's sake.</p><p>But she does hazard a guess as to why, "You like to touch more than be touched?"</p><p>Rio nods. More of a shuffle that messes up the hair at the back of their head from the half up half down tie that their relatively short hair has been pulled back in.</p><p>"So, <em>not</em> a butch bottom then," Agatha heaves out an over dramatic sigh, and then in a sing-song voice rings out, "Boring."</p><p>God, she almost feels bad for enjoying the flush that goes from cheeks to ears, but she can't really help it.</p><p>"Bet you like wearing the strap, right?" She says, grin curling. And it's amusing to watch Rio's eyes bug out of their head but there <em>is</em> a purpose to this: she wants to show them the benefits of not having to <em>bottom</em> while subbing.</p><p>Rio chokes out an affirmation, and so Agatha carries on.</p><p>"What if you were strapped up," Agatha starts, voice dropping somewhere sultry, below where the bounds of friendship flirting stops, "And the base of your cock wasn't <em>quite</em> where you need it. We could tie your arms up too." Agatha shifts to straddle Rio's hips—just so they get the proper image, remains hovering above them, "Color?" She asks again, wants to make sure this is okay, that she's on the right lines too.</p><p><em>"Green."</em> Rio gasps like they're <em>getting</em> it, and the tipping point for Agatha's brain to snap apart from her mouth, her body, is seeing Rio's arms immediately reach up to the headboard, like they know it would please Agatha.</p><p>And, <em>fuck,</em> for some reason it does.</p><p>"What if I rode you til I came, over and over and over again, and you had no part in it," She's careful not to press back into Rio's crotch, which is hard when her hips want to move to her own words. She leans over, one hand next to Rio's shoulder in the mattress and holding herself up, while the other comes to firmly grip Rio's chin, smiles—all teeth, "Just a glorified toy for me to use."</p><p>Rio is panting, chest heaving, and honeyed eyes swallowed almost wholly by palpable arousal. She tracks a bead of sweat that drips from their temple.</p><p><em>"Yeah."</em></p><p>Agatha watches in real time the way Rio's brow furrows when she shoves herself off their hips, plasters a smile on her face, and swallows past the lump in her throat, "Something like that is more your thing, probably."</p><p>Probably. Like Agatha couldn't fucking tell. Like she doesn't know something incredibly intimate about someone she's been friends with for longer than she's able to stomach most people.</p><p>Rio lets go of the headboard, props themself up on their elbows. Agatha doesn't feel guilty often, but she knows it's because of her that Rio can't look her in the eye.</p><p>"I think I get why people like it now."</p><p>Agatha nods and for a moment is uncharacteristically lost for words, "I think that's enough for you to get by on." She manages to force out.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio shakes their head, looks a little more cognizant after, "Yeah, thank you."</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had sort of expected Rio to leave after that—an awkward exit that they hadn't experienced since they were young and prone to hormonal outbursts.</p><p>But Rio stayed, insisted on rewinding the film and staying until it finished. They didn't talk much, and Rio would have rather looked anywhere in the room but Agatha's face for the rest of the night. But they stayed, nonetheless, sock covered feet on the sofa—the only one of Agatha's friends who's allowed to do that, and pressed them into Agatha's thigh like everything is normal.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>And everything <em>is</em> normal.</p><p>That remained the only night of its kind. Agatha didn't even ask whether they've used what she taught them.</p><p>(Though avoiding a conversation about Maria isn't too much of a hardship.)</p><p>And it's definitely normal for her mind to slip back there sometimes, even months later.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes a story gets a little convoluted. Especially when Agatha is telling it.</p><p>Especially when Agatha is lying.</p><p>But Agatha, hand on heart and hope her mother dies, or however the saying goes, for once isn't lying when she says that's about all the build up there is.</p><p>To fill in the very minor gaps between the <em>then</em> of running Shibari 101, and the <em>now</em> of being face down, ass up on the center of her own bed, with her arms fed between her thighs, wrists tied to her lower legs in a <em>very</em> confident tie, Agatha's rampant brain has to break this down into easily comprehensible bite sized chunks.</p><p>It is, admittedly, a little hard to think when she's tied as she is. Maybe her blood is rushing to her head, she thinks, though realistically she knows Rio has made sure to prop her comfortably up with cushions under her upper body so that, and any unnecessary discomfort, is lessened.</p><p>This doesn't mean anything, so why does the thought of Rio learning beyond what Agatha had taught them repulse her?</p><p>Either way, the real, honest-to-god facts are;</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Rio and Maria broke up.</p></li>
<li>
<p>As a subsection to that, Agatha gets to stop referring to them as <em>Mario</em> in her head.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rio came to <em>her</em> right after after it happened—which shouldn't be much of a shock but Rio hasn't been in her house since the night they delved into bondage together. As friends. For teaching reasons.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rio <em>laughed</em> when they divulged that the only reason they stayed together for as long as they did was because of stupid Agatha and her stupid lesson.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Agatha made the mistake of saying, <em>"Oh, so you think you're a dom now? Last time you were here I had you whimpering underneath me."</em> Which is not something Agatha had ever thought of saying to Rio before, and probably should never have left her mouth.</p></li>
<li>
<p>As she's on a roll with verbal mistakes this evening, why wouldn't she also say a resounding <em>yes</em> when Rio asked, <em>"Would you like me to prove it?"</em></p></li>
<li>
<p>And yet another one when she said a joking <em>of course</em> to Rio's joking <em>do you want to take your clothes off?</em></p></li>
</ol><p>And so, here she is—Rio fitting their fingers between rope and skin like someone good, and kind, and respectful, and not at all like the overcompensating doms of Agatha's early twenties. Agatha, stripped down to just her underwear and a thin tank, can only thank unhearing gods that she likes to treat herself to nice things, and wearing lace is a regular thing for her.</p><p>It's been a long time since Agatha was on the receiving end of any rope play, but Rio—the person she trusts most in the world, has made quick, habitual passes of the rope around her body, all while making light conversation about their fucking work week, <em>and</em> checking in with her on what fucking color she is.</p><p>She's green. So fucking green it's ridiculous.</p><p>She can feel her heart <em>everywhere,</em> feels it beat harder and harder the closer Rio gets to finishing their tie. Because what happens when it's finished? <em>Fuck,</em> this would all be so much easier if this was anyone but Rio. But then again, Agatha would have shut this down at the first insinuation if it <em>was</em> anyone but Rio.</p><p>(It's always been the same with the pair of them—Agatha's never known how to back down from a challenge issued by Rio. She doesn't know what Rio's excuse for suggesting this is.)</p><p>She'd been sort of waiting for Rio to chicken out—hadn't thought it would go this far. She'd watched their throat constrict, their eyes widen when she started peeling her clothes off, and half expected them to nervously laugh like they often do, avert their gaze with a hand on her forearm to stop her. But she hadn't been stopped. And more importantly—more <em>worryingly,</em> she hadn't <em>wanted</em> to be stopped.</p><p>So that's where Agatha's at right now—trying to come to terms with the fact she's enjoying being tied up for the first time in a <em>long</em> while, and also trying to keep the repeated <em>I'm wet, I can feel it sticking to me, Rio can probably fucking see it,</em> thoughts from sluicing from her brain.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio's voice finds a gap in the stream. They sound careful, a little worried. It's only then that she realizes she's been hearing them speak to her for maybe a minute now, their voice like a soft blanket.</p><p>Agatha doesn't get tongue tied often, but it seems to sit too heavy in her mouth, offers a hum as her only response.</p><p>"We don't have to do anything." Rio says, and Agatha wonders if that's what they've both been thinking this whole time. Does Rio even want that or are they just humoring Agatha? Proving a point and nothing else.</p><p>"Do anything?" She forces out, unsticks her tongue from the roof of her mouth as she tries to regain the upper hand she's pretty sure she's solidly lost in the time she's spent not even slightly fighting Rio tying her up. She's a fucking embarrassment, she's aware. "What did you think we were gonna do?"</p><p>"I mean," Rio sounds too amused for Agatha's liking, "You're the one who took your clothes off."</p><p>"You're the one who asked." Agatha hisses.</p><p>"I didn't think—" Rio cuts themself off, and Agatha's heart thuds with the thought that maybe Rio hadn't meant for her to go through with it, "I didn't think you'd say yes."</p><p>She's going to have to change her name and move somewhere far away when Rio unties her.</p><p>"Way to embarrass the woman who you've got naked and tied up." Agatha turns her head, speaks her words into the sheets under her while her face burns.</p><p>She just about hears Rio muttering, "Not <em>fully</em> naked." And is about to snarl back when Rio says, to her rather than themself this time, "Do you want me to untie you?"</p><p><em>Yes,</em> Agatha wants to want to say.</p><p>She doesn't, of course. Doesn't say no either.</p><p>"Do <em>you</em> want to untie me?"</p><p>"I don't—" Rio stammers, sounds much more like how she thought Rio would be in this situation, "I don't know."</p><p>From the safety of freshly washed linen, Agatha breathes deep, allows little things like <em>consequences</em> to leak from her mind, leaves herself only with the thoughts of Rio touching her, spreading her open, taking her apart. She's never thought of Rio like this before. Sure, she's been barraged with images of what they might like in bed when she knows Rio's on a respectable date number three or higher, but she's never thought about Rio in bed with <em>her.</em></p><p>It's the only thing rattling around her brain right now.</p><p>"God, Rio," She breathes, and the whine in her voice that would usually mortify her gets thrown out the same window as those pesky consequences, "Either fucking touch me or untie me."</p><p>"Sweetheart," Rio says, voice soft. They've never called her that before and it ping pongs around Agatha's empty mind. A comforting hand is placed on her lower back, "I don't want you to do something you'll regret."</p><p>"I <em>won't</em> regret it, fucking hell," Agatha should be impressed with Rio's ties—this <em>was</em> the initial purpose of all of this, but she can only grit her teeth when she tries to close her legs, get some sort of friction to her pulsing cunt, but <em>can't</em> with the way Rio's tied her arms to the inside of her legs, "You're the only one who's had me like this in a long time. I know what I'm doing."</p><p>"You don't think we should talk about this first?"</p><p>"What?" Agatha scoffs, sways her hips and hopes to god Rio's an ass guy, "You gonna untie me just for me to say 'yeah, Rio,'" She exaggerates, just for them, "'I want you to fuck me' and then tie me right back up again?"</p><p>"Agatha…"</p><p>"I want this," She says, plainly, "And it's fine if you don't. I understand. But if you're only holding back because you think I'll regret it in the morning…" She trails off, racks her brain for something to soothe Rio's overworking brain with, "Rio, I'm green."</p><p>It takes a minute for Rio to answer—brain quite obviously cracking and sparking, but then, "You want this." They say in a way that sounds more like a realization sinking in than a question.</p><p>"Do you?" Agatha throws the ball right back in their court.</p><p>Rio nods their head like there couldn't have been a different answer, "Yeah."</p><p>The words and what it means for them sit heavy between them, and so Agatha, just to make Rio laugh, tilts her head so she's not speaking into the mattress, "What's a little bondage between friends?"</p><p>It works—Rio huffing out from their nose in a way Agatha can picture their exact face, chin pressed to chest to hide their smile, eyes closed like looking at Agatha will set them off into hysterical laughter.</p><p>Once it passes, Rio steps round into view, crouches down in front of her and tenderly cups her face in their gentle hands. Agatha blinks a few times—nowhere to look but at Rio, and <em>fuck,</em> does it feel more real now. "We're doing this?"</p><p>But Agatha's no good for <em>tender</em> and so says, "If by <em>this</em> you mean fucking me through the mattress 'til I can't feel my legs, then I hope so."</p><p>Something flashes behind Rio's eyes and they grin, "If that's what you want." And then plant a soft kiss to Agatha's cheek—one that leaves her eyelids fluttering in time with her heart, before retreating back to behind Agatha.</p><p>She feels the bed dip under their weight and then their hand—the one that had rested comfortably on her back, lands firmly on her ass this time, palms the flesh in their unyielding grip.</p><p>"Rio—" She gasps, which is incredibly stupid because Rio's barely even touched her, but she can't fucking help it.</p><p>"I was trying to be very normal and respectful when I was tying you up," Agatha feels a solitary finger slowly trace the inside of her thigh, runs alongside the seam of her underwear, surely brushing through the thick hair that spills out onto her thighs, "But it was hard with you all squirmy and so obviously turned on," Agatha tries to roll her eyes but her body won't commit to it, and then decides the intention is good enough because Rio can't even see her face from this angle, "I bet I can feel how wet you are through these."</p><p>And when they say those words, the knuckle of that finger nudges up against her covered cunt.</p><p>Agatha can hear the smug grin in their voice when they hum and say, "Thought so."</p><p>"Rio, just touch me." She gets out through gritted teeth, tries to push herself back into the light touch as much as she can, doesn't get very far with it.</p><p>But Rio, thank fucking god, does something even better—peels her underwear slowly down her legs until they're at her knees and can't go any further, and then with both thumbs, spreads her open.</p><p><em>"Shit."</em> Agatha reburies her head in the sheets at the touch. She feels so exposed. It feels so <em>dirty.</em> It's exactly what she needs.</p><p><em>"Jesus,"</em> Rio whines, and if Agatha's brain was currently able to build sentences more complex than <em>fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,</em> then she'd probably say something like, <em>no Jesus here.</em> "I bet it wouldn't take much to have you dripping onto your sheets."</p><p><em>Where</em> has all of this been hiding?</p><p>Agatha's grip on the situation—her internal reassurance that she'll regain the upper hand when she gets her clothes off, when she bends over, when Rio touches her, when they see how desperate her cunt is to be touched by them—is quickly fading.</p><p>"Put your fingers inside me and prove it then." She hisses, unused to not being able to <em>take</em> her pleasure at will.</p><p>"You're so feisty." Rio says like they're talking to a fucking wet kitten, but before Agatha gets a chance to fight back—almost like they've timed it to perfection—the moment she opens her mouth the only thing that comes out of it is a pathetic whimper as they push the tips of two fingers just barely inside her.</p><p><em>"More."</em></p><p>Rio, once again, doesn't do as she asks. And that's yet another thing she's not used to, because Rio usually takes a request, a command, a plea from Agatha like a dog does from its owner.</p><p>Instead, they pull their fingers from inside her and make some soft touches to the outside of her cunt, pads of fingertips stroking over her in exploratory passes, making sure to avoid her clit. They even drag their fingers through the thick hair between her legs, and Agatha just has to fucking <em>let them.</em></p><p>This is undoubtedly the very last time she allows herself to sub for anyone. It's awful. She doesn't know why anyone does it.</p><p>This one particular thought does of course come undone when Rio's clearly mapped every part of her—sans clit—enough to possibly recreate her pussy in oil painting form, and they finally give her exactly what she wants.</p><p>Rio's fingers are longer, a little thicker than her own. She knows because they've measured them before. Palm to palm and fingers stretching as much as they can when they were young and stupid in school and imitating their friend Wanda with the weird transfer student she ended up making her husband, and subsequently bringing into Agatha's home because she's still friends with all these freaks.</p><p>If they <em>hadn't</em> done any of that, she'd be finding out now—with Rio sliding two fingers deep inside her to the fucking knuckle right away. Agatha digs her forehead into the bed at the feeling that's <em>so</em> much more than two of her own.</p><p>"You took them so easy, baby."</p><p><em>Baby, baby, baby, baby—</em></p><p>The pet name rings from one ear to the other and back again. An accident, she's sure—caught up in the moment and the sex of it all.</p><p>"That's because it's only two fingers, Rio." She makes a point of calling Rio by their actual fucking name like a normal person.</p><p>"Are you usually this argumentative when you're getting fucked?"</p><p>Rio punctuates their words with a curl of their fingers that drops Agatha's jaw. She's just glad they're behind her and can't see the way she chews on the bed sheet for a moment before she all but growls, "I'm usually in control of when I get fucked."</p><p>And still no let up from Rio who starts up a delicious rhythm, slow and deep. Their only response is a fake sympathetic <em>poor baby</em> as they use their other hand to grab her ass cheek and spread her open to watch how she takes their fingers.</p><p>"If I weren't tied up—"</p><p>"You'd what?" Rio pulls their fingers all the way out, and before Agatha can start up another complaint, fits a third alongside them and slowly pushes back in, cresting argument breaking softly in her throat, "You'd pin me down and ride my fingers?"</p><p>They push in as deep as they can—three feeling <em>a lot</em> more than she's used to taking from fingers alone, "You'd have already come at least once, maybe twice by now? The thing is, Agatha," They lean over her back, keep their fingers stilled deep inside, "I'd fucking enjoy it. But that's not what you wanted."</p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em></p><p>An overwhelmed tear slips from the corner of her eye. They're right. Of course they're right. Agatha Harkness never does anything she doesn't want, and she wants <em>this.</em></p><p><em>"Rio."</em></p><p>"It's okay, baby," There they go again—<em>baby, baby, baby—</em>but Agatha doesn't have time to think about it before Rio's snaking a hand under her stomach and seeking out her clit, "I've got you."</p><p>They circle her clit like they've known her body for longer than just tonight, expertly bringing Agatha instantly close to the edge. It's lethal—the heady combination of the tie, and the position, and the thick fingers, and the rubbing on her clit has her—</p><p>"Gonna come. <em>Fuck,</em> Rio, I'm gonna fucking come."</p><p>Rio gasps against the sweat soaked skin of Agatha's back, "Did I say you could?" But doesn't do anything to slow her down.</p><p>"Rio, Rio, <em>fuck,</em> let me <em>come."</em></p><p>Rio licks up her back—fucking freak, "Are you gonna ask nicely?"</p><p>Agatha thinks she might puncture a hole through her lip with how hard she bites it in an attempt to keep quiet.</p><p>"No?" Rio's voice is sickly sweet and Agatha knows exactly why when they stop all movements, and then horrifically removes their fingers from her clit, and pull out from her cunt until Agatha's empty and clenching around nothing but air, "That's fine, sweetheart, I can wait."</p><p>"No, no, Rio, I need it." Agatha's fingers flex open like she has any chance of reaching out, grabbing Rio, and bringing them back where they belong.</p><p>"You can have it," Rio says, and tortures Agatha further by letting her hear them very obviously sucking their fingers into their mouth, "You just have to ask nicely. It's so easy."</p><p><em>Shit.</em> Agatha squeezes her eyes tightly shut, and then very reluctantly lets out a small, <em>"Please."</em></p><p>"Sorry, what was that?"</p><p>"Do <em>not</em> make me say it again."</p><p>She says it and fuck, does she want to stick by it, but then Rio brings their fingers back to press against her entrance, and like before, pushes only the tips inside her.</p><p><em>"Please,</em> I need you.<em>"</em> Agatha's eyes remain closed, waits for Rio to ridicule and mock her, but it never comes. Instead, they press a soft kiss to her side—as close to her stomach as the angle allows, before pushing back inside her, fingers reaching round for her clit again.</p><p>She'd like to say it took longer than a minute, but as her orgasm crashes over her Agatha finds she lacks the capacity to lie.</p><p>"You look so good when you come." Rio sounds a little in awe when they pull out, which—good. As it should be.</p><p>"Yeah? Make me do it again then."</p><p>Agatha hears Rio laugh just a little and then their face comes into view, "Do you need to change position?"</p><p>Hm. Agatha takes stock of her body, "I'm good."</p><p>"You're sure?" Rio's eyes rake over Agatha's whole body. She wonders if they've been watching her this closely the whole time, watching for any indication of discomfort.</p><p>They're so sincere about it that Agatha doesn't even have it in her to be cruel when she says, "I can call yellow if I'm not."</p><p>Rio nods, settled, but looks suddenly like they have no idea what they're supposed to do next. Agatha doesn't think it's worth trying to make herself feel bad for her ego swelling at the thought of stupid <em>Marlene</em> or whoever not going for another round.</p><p>But before any of that, much more importantly, Agatha notices how Rio's still fully dressed—the real downside to starting the bondage side of their relationship before the sex side, "Rio, let me see you."</p><p>They blink at her like they hadn't expected this, but it maybe shouldn't be surprising that Rio had thought she'd prioritize herself this much. That would usually be the case, but today she wants to <em>look,</em> especially if she can't touch. Especially if this is the only time they're going to do this. And she expects it will be.</p><p>"Oh, uh…" Rio fiddles with the hem of their t-shirt before pulling it over their head in one quick motion like they're ripping off a band-aid. They make sure to keep themself in Agatha's eye line, which is much appreciated because she gets a delicious view of Rio's abs and their taped chest.</p><p>Agatha <em>knows</em> what Rio's got going on under their clothes, but knowing and seeing are different things entirely. They live different lives, have no reason to be <em>changing</em> in front of each other like at the sleepovers they regularly had when they were younger—Rio's parents more than happy to have Agatha over, and Agatha more than happy to get away from her mother.</p><p><em>God,</em> Agatha wants her mouth on them.</p><p>It's a very cruel thought to have materialize when she's restrained the way she is.</p><p>She watches, eagle eyed as they push their jeans down their thighs, takes in every inch of skin that gets exposed. She'll settle for looking, just for now.</p><p>"You remember where I keep my toy chest, right?" Agatha says to stop herself from saying something like <em>let me suck bruises into your skin.</em></p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"How about you go and strap up while I stay here and look pretty?"</p><p>A weird gurgling sound leaves Rio's throat that <em>could</em> be some sort of <em>okay</em> if the way they dart across the room is any indication. Agatha's head empties as she listens to Rio rummaging through the chest and mumbling to themself.</p><p>"Do you have a preference?"</p><p>Since apparently tonight is meant to be about Agatha letting go, she tells them to decide.</p><p>"You have a lot," Agatha laughs at how daunted by this task Rio sounds, "I didn't think you topped all that often."</p><p>Agatha huffs at the admittedly correct assumption. "Those are for <em>me,"</em> She clarifies, "I'm so sick of people claiming they have a dick big enough and then disappointing me."</p><p>"Oh." Is all Rio says, but from the sound, Agatha thinks they're focusing on putting the harness on properly. It's <em>weird</em> not knowing what's going on behind her. A gentle touch to her hip lets Agatha know that Rio's back, and any nerves die down. "Do you—" Rio cuts themself off with a cough, the telltale sign of their own embarrassment, "Um, do you use <em>all</em> of those things?"</p><p>Agatha has no idea what they're referring to that's got them all flustered when they've already used her own rope to tie her up, but <em>yes</em> she has used everything she owns, and her brain is a little too mushy to try to pick just one thing apart from the lot, "Well, they're <em>mine,</em> aren't they?"</p><p>Agatha <em>hears</em> Rio's gulp from behind her and she grins into the sheets below her. God, they're so <em>easy.</em></p><p>The smile slips from her face, becomes a more pleasure filled, open mouthed thing when Rio nudges the tip of their cock against her.</p><p><em>"Yes,</em> Rio." Her hands flex again, not even a purposeful movement but she can't help it, wants Rio in deep, wants their hips pressed up against her, wants to feel even the slightest amount of skin beneath her fingertips with how close they are.</p><p>"You want it?" Rio asks like it hasn't all been leading up to this. Like it's not <em>obvious</em> how much Agatha wants to be fucking split open. She's about to say just that when Rio groans, "Shit, I didn't grab lube."</p><p>Agatha, for lack of being able to reach anything else, digs sharp nails into her own legs, "Rio," She sighs, exasperated and fucking turned on because Rio hasn't pulled away, still has the tip of the strap resting at her entrance like they're fucking <em>teasing</em> her, "I'm so fucking wet. If you dare leave to go grab lube I swear I will tear through this rope and kill you with my bare hands."</p><p>She must sound convincing enough to Rio because they don't even try to argue, grab hold of Agatha's hips and slowly, carefully pushes inside.</p><p>Agatha feels herself stretch for Rio to fit—a mind numbing feeling. There are benefits to this, she supposes, doesn't have to do anything but lie there and take it, easily putting her trust in Rio.</p><p>"You look so good like this," Rio gasps, fingers twitching on Agatha's hips, "You know when you had me bent over," They say almost conversationally, wait for Agatha's brain to cast back to when this was just friendly advice, "All I could think about was having <em>you</em> like that."</p><p><em>Fuck.</em></p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> She wants to respond properly but all that's running through her head is <em>Rio, Rio, Rio.</em> Can't think of anything but them and the way their hips slot firmly against her ass when they finish speaking.</p><p>Nothing else leaves her lips, nothing else <em>can</em> with the way Rio pulls back out and starts up head-emptying thrusts that get just a little faster each time. All Agatha knows is the feeling of Rio filling her up perfectly, over and over again.</p><p><em>"God,</em> it's like I can feel you." Rio gasps out when Agatha's mind is almost getting used to the only sounds being harsh pants, and gasps, and the sound of her own cunt.</p><p>"Feels good?"</p><p>"Yeah, baby," One of Rio's hands leaves her hip to stroke over her stomach, "It's like you were made for this."</p><p><em>Yes,</em> Agatha's demon brain hisses, <em>yes—made for Rio.</em></p><p>It only takes Rio sliding their hand from Agatha's stomach to her clit, rubbing a few quick circles around it, for Agatha's eyes to roll into the back of her head as she comes.</p><p>It takes a moment for Agatha's brain to catch her back up, her cunt still full and taking Rio's now irregular and frantic thrusts.</p><p><em>"Baby,"</em> Rio whines, "I'm so close, I'm so—"</p><p>Rio's fingers slip from her clit as they use that hand to hold themself up. She doesn't even need it—hurtling towards another orgasm at breakneck pace.</p><p>"Rio, <em>please."</em> Agatha hears herself gasp, wet and needy, doesn't even know what she's pleading <em>for,</em> just knows it's something only Rio can give her.</p><p>Rio slots their hips against Agatha, presses in deep and grinds themself against her ass as they come, a deep moan falling from their throat. It's this—knowing Rio's deep inside her and <em>coming</em> that tips Agatha over the edge into another orgasm, feels herself clenching around the strap buried deep inside her.</p><p>After the few moments it takes for Rio to recover, they slowly slips out of Agatha, who can't stop the unhappy groan from escaping when they do. That changes when they bend down, press a kiss to the back of her thigh and touch a wrist lightly, "Can I undo these?"</p><p>"Please." Agatha nods into the blankets, mouth dry from overuse, and focuses on the feeling of Rio's deft hands untying her. They unfold her from her position where she feels a little like a shrimp that's been straightened out, and she sighs happily as she stretches her muscles, lets Rio tug her underwear the rest of the way down her legs and lets them move her arms enough to pull her sweat soaked tank over her head, baring her entirely.</p><p>She feels like she could fall right asleep, eyes closed and content to let Rio move her into her soft pillows and rub a balm into her skin where the rope had been.</p><p>"Thank you." Agatha says, throat raw.</p><p>"Oh," Rio says. Agatha can feel them shifting around, "Hold on, baby, let me get some water." She's not in her body enough to fight being shifted so Rio can scoot away from her, muttering to themself about being stupid not to think about bringing any—as though any of this was really planned. "I'll be so quick, just wait there." They say, smooth out the irritated crease between Agatha's brows.</p><p>The speed that Rio loosens and shoves the harness to the ground as they shuffle to the door would probably be funny if Agatha didn't already miss them so much.</p><p>True to their word, they're back with Agatha, cold bottle of water grabbed from her fridge in less than a minute. It doesn't stop Agatha from reaching out for Rio like she's wanted to do most of the night. Rio falls back onto the bed, uncaps the water for her and encourages her to drink before they wrap Agatha up in strong arms like they know it's exactly what she needs.</p><p>"I didn't get to touch you." Agatha says, quiet, not sure she wants to put the thought out there in case Rio wouldn't have wanted that from Agatha.</p><p>Rio hums, "There's always next time."</p><p>It isn't <em>said</em> like a joke, but it must be. This is a one time thing between friends. Once Rio leaves, this is over. Agatha tightens her grip on them and doesn't say anything in response.</p><p>"Is there anything you usually want during aftercare?" Rio says, holds Agatha close to their chest, fingers brushing out knots in her unruly hair.</p><p>"I'm not usually on this side of it," Agatha mumbles into the chest, feels their tape under her lips, throws an arm over their stomach and nuzzles in, "'S different."</p><p>"Well, is there anything you want?" Rio's words are almost whispered, "You can have anything you want."</p><p><em>Just you,</em> Agatha's mind says, makes her heart jump up into her throat where it doesn't fucking belong.</p><p>"Do you have those videos of the ravens talking like people?" She says instead.</p><p>"I thought you said they freaked you out." She can hear the amusement in Rio's voice even when they immediately start feeling around for their phone, find Agatha's first with a fumbling hand, easily enters her passcode.</p><p>"They do," Agatha says, voice not at all whiny, "But like, in a good way. Like how watching a horror film is fun."</p><p>She doesn't say <em>they remind me of you, I want to be surrounded by you.</em> She doesn't even know what that fucking means.</p><p>Agatha drifts off to her brain itching hearing those birds talking in too-human voices, to Rio stroking her hair, and switching off atop their rumbling chest when they try to laugh quietly so as not to disturb her.</p><p>The last thing she hears before she loses consciousness entirely is Rio whispering a soft, "I love you."</p><p>"Love you." She mutters back, thinks she might be drooling on Rio's chest. The words come naturally—she <em>does</em> love Rio, tells them all the time. They're her closest friend. And in the morning they'll go back to normal.</p>

<p><em>"Do you believe in love at first sight?"</em></p><p><em>Now, Rio likes making Agatha laugh. </em>Loves<em> it, even—it's one of their favorite sounds. But as Agatha clutches her stomach and cries laughing, has to quite literally wipe streaming tears from her cheeks, Rio feels it in their chest like a spray of broken glass.</em></p><p><em>"Rio, I barely even believe in </em>love."<em> Agatha says as her laughter trails off into an amused hum, "Oh, god. Don't tell me you do."</em></p><p><em>"No." Rio lets Agatha make a liar of them. They have, of course, been in love with Agatha since they were a gangly teenager with no friends, when she sat down opposite them and stole their lunch with a smile on her face.</em></p><p><em>They're sat, drunk and halfheartedly trying to sober up on the kitchen floor, speaking in hushed voices so as not to wake their other roommates. Rio's water bottle in the gap between their thighs, their hands brushing against each other in their shared bag of fries.</em></p><p><em>Rio swallows one down like cardboard, says, "Wait, I thought you said you weren't interested in dating. Not that you don't believe in love. Like… conceptually."</em></p><p><em>"Conceptually," Agatha hums like it's funny, then rolls her head against the wall they've propped themselves up against so she's looking at Rio, pout on her face, eyes gleaming, and says with a performative pitched voice, "Mommy didn't love me enough as a child and it's hindered my ability to love and be loved."</em></p><p><em>Rio's eyebrows knit together, "That's not true," They say, and in a moment of drunken vulnerability, words spill from their lips, unable to stop themself, "I love you."</em></p><p><em>The pout falls from Agatha's lips as her eyes roam Rio's face like she's looking for the telltale signs of being lied to. Rio holds still, waits for their words to sink in—they've held them back for so long that the entire kitchen seems to only have space for the two of them and Rio's confession.</em></p><p><em>It feels like minutes, hours that Agatha stares at them, but eventually a smile twitches on her lips and she lets out a laugh, head rolling away to stare up at the ceiling, "You don't need to pity me, Rio," She says as though it's entirely unbelievable that someone could fall in love with her, "I'm trying to self-therapize. I assume that's what one would tell me."</em></p><p><em>And so Rio's words get sucked back into their throat—feel heavier than ever when they settle back in the pit of their stomach.</em></p><p><em>It was unfair of them, probably, to put that on Agatha. And really, Rio thinks she's saved them both a lot of awkwardness by pretending not to know what Rio had meant.</em></p><p><em>They resolve to keep their feelings to themself from now on. Nothing is worth losing Agatha.</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wakes to a hand on her stomach and knees touching the back of her own. It takes a moment for her to remember where she is (her own bedroom) and what happened (her best friend tied her up and fucked her until her brain was mush).</p><p>It's just—maybe it's stupid—but she hadn't expected Rio to <em>stay.</em> Agatha knows what this is, knows her way round a one night stand better than most. Rio's very much a relationship person, probably hasn't had to make a silent escape into the night.</p><p>Would that have been worse? Was Rio right to stay?</p><p>Fuck, this is why she doesn't sleep with friends.</p><p>Unfortunately for Agatha, it's probably the best sex she's ever had and ever <em>will</em> have. She's yet to turn thirty and already she knows everything will be measured against last night with Rio. How depressing.</p><p>Agatha's brain throws out the image of Rio waking and pressing their knee between her thighs and her whole fucking body reacts to the thought of Rio touching her again, <em>wanting</em> her ag—</p><p>Agatha turns her head, forces her face into the mattress, hopes to rid herself of that half-brewed form entirely.</p><p>(Agatha is selfish though, and <em>fuck</em> she wants Rio again.)</p><p>Her heart is hammering in her chest—can feel it in her temple, her toes. She's not surprised when Rio shifts behind her; it's surely loud enough to be echoing through the room.</p><p>She tries to keep still, hasn't worked out what to say now that everything has to go back to normal, even when she's naked and being held so tightly—Rio's fingers flexing against her stomach, their hand pressing her even closer to their front.</p><p>There's a rustling sound that pulls Agatha out of her own head; it doesn't take long to figure out what it is—Rio rubbing their feet together under the covers. It's woken Agatha up many times over the years—at the sleepovers they'd have at Rio's house, sleeping top and tail in their bed, as roommates in college when they'd both be too drunk to even pretend to want to be alone.</p><p>And yet, even after all this time, Agatha still doesn't quite know what it means. She lets out a breath—shakier than she's ever known from herself, and shifts against the sheets, just in case Rio needs reason to escape, in case they want to try to pull away and have Agatha's unconscious form not notice them slipping out of bed.</p><p>For some unknown reason, Rio tightens their hold on Agatha, mumbles in a sleep heavy voice, "Sorry," And before Agatha has time to work out what the hell they could be apologizing for, "Did I wake you up?"</p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck,</em> is all that's running through Agatha's head as she rolls over to face them. Not that she'd admit it to anyone else, and not even to herself outside the late hours of the night, or the few minutes her brain takes to start up properly in the morning, but Agatha isn't immune to making mistakes.</p><p>Rolling over and facing Rio—seeing their sleep mussed hair, their bare shoulders, their chest covered only by tape, the arm they've kept over Agatha's body even through her moving, is one such mistake. Because no words leave her gaping mouth at the sight of them.</p><p>She watches Rio bite their lip, watches their eyes dart round the room like they know they should have left by now.</p><p>All Agatha does is shake her head, brings Rio's eyes back to her, "No," She says, voice thick with sleep, "You didn't wake me."</p><p>Rio hums, their fingers starting to tap an obviously nervous rhythm on Agatha's rib cage.</p><p><em>Last night was a mistake,</em> Agatha hears in Rio's voice, <em>it can't happen again. Friends don't do this, </em>and then her brain decides to be nice to her, <em>I can't lose you,</em> and,<em> I didn't get to taste you last night.</em></p><p>Wait.</p><p><em>I didn't get to taste you last night.</em></p><p>Her ears and her eyes play catch up with each other and suddenly she's replaying the very real moment that Rio said, <em>"I didn't get to taste you last night."</em></p><p>They pull away from her then, sit up and with the hand that had been holding Agatha, they start picking at the quilt, staring down at her with wide eyes, "Sorry. We don't have to do anyth—"</p><p>"No." Agatha gets out before she can think. She shouldn't—she knows it's such a bad idea to do it again but she can't help but <em>want.</em> If Rio wants to make her come again before they go back to being <em>normal</em> friends, she'll take it. Which is a normal thing to think about a friend who, just last night, was responsible for the most intense orgasm Agatha's ever had. "I just…" She trails off, clears her throat, mortified by her own hesitation, "I didn't think—"</p><p>"You didn't think…" Rio trails off, looks a lot more like they did last night now that Agatha's been reduced to some kind of stammering idiot, "That I'd wanna make you come on my tongue?"</p><p>Which is an insane thing to say to your best friend, frankly.</p><p>Even more insane is the way Rio's eyes drop below her face, the way their tongue darts out to wet their lips at the sight of Agatha's tits. Agatha smirks—this she can do; she grips the sheet and subtly shifts it a little lower, gives Rio a better view.</p><p>She can't blame them for looking—they didn't really get a chance last night.</p><p>Rio takes it as an offer, leans down and presses a kiss to Agatha's breastbone—much too gentle a thing for what this is, and so she fists Rio's hair, relishes in the surprised groan they let out, and pushes their head down. They don't fight it, wrap their lips around a nipple, the combination of teeth and tongue has her already squirming against the sheets by the time they move onto her other breast—hand covering the one they just left.</p><p><em>God,</em> she can't fucking take much more of this. She thinks she's been wet since the moment she woke up—Rio's touch lighting her up from the inside.</p><p>Agatha tightens the grip she has in Rio's hair and pulls. They rise obediently, lips tinged pink from use, and hover over her, look down at Agatha like she's done something adjacent to hanging the stars rather than offering herself up for a selfish final orgasm.</p><p>Rio's heavy-lidded eyes drop to Agatha's lips, and she only has a second to stop them from making a mistake even weightier than what they did last night.</p><p>They're so close to pressing their lips to Agatha's, and she almost gives in, just to know how it feels. But that's not what this is. Instead, she presses her hand to Rio's chest, stops them from closing the distance, and says, "You're taking your time for someone who seemed desperate to eat me out."</p><p>Rio's answer comes in a thick swallow. Agatha pictures her lips pressed to their neck, imagines she can feel it.</p><p>Fuck, she needs this to stop. She loves Rio, of course, but not like that. It's just that it's harder to stop the swelling in her chest this morning. Maybe she needs Rio to tie her back up so her brain stops trying to trip her up into feelings she doesn't have.</p><p>Rio doesn't try to kiss her again; Agatha watches as their pupils dilate and threaten to completely take over warm brown. They're so fucking compliant this morning, it has Agatha thinking about how good Rio would sub for her. Not that they're going to get the chance.</p><p>They shift down her body, dropping open mouthed kisses and the occasional bite to her skin as they go. Agatha loosens her harsh grip in Rio's hair but keeps her hand there, eyes fluttering shut as she tries to empty her mind the way it had been last night, shakes off the thought that she can't replicate that same feeling without Rio being in control the way they were.</p><p>Rio spreads her thighs, strong hands forcing them apart—the show of strength doing absolutely nothing to temper her need. They settle in the space between them, eyes laser focused on her cunt, fingers gently carding through the thick hair and then down to spread her open. And Agatha <em>knows</em> she's wet, but it's a whole different thing to feel the way Rio's touch goes from a drag to a smooth glide the moment they part her folds with a single finger.</p><p>The shaky breath she lets out at the touch draws Rio's eyes back up to her for a moment, "Okay?" They ask, because of course they do.</p><p>Agatha nods as best she can, "Touch me." She says before Rio can think to say anything else.</p><p>And Rio does, lowers their head, presses a soft kiss to the inside of her thigh that almost has Agatha's grip tightening once more in Rio's hair, frustration swelling instantly in her chest, before it fizzles out as Rio presses their mouth to her cunt.</p><p>She hums happily, finally getting what she wants, and strokes her hand through Rio's hair. It's only just occurring to Agatha that she can <em>touch</em> Rio this time.</p><p>Rio's mouth is <em>everywhere</em> but her clit, exploring like they had last night with their fingers. <em>"Rio,"</em> She sighs, feels Rio's answering hum like electricity through her. She bucks her hips up into Rio's mouth, tries to get their mouth on her clit, but to no avail, "Rio, come on."</p><p>They don't listen to her, keep a hand on her thigh so she can't close her legs even slightly, keeping her spread open. Which should be more annoying but, <em>fuck,</em> she'd never admit it out loud but it feels so fucking good to just lie back and <em>take</em> it.</p><p>The hand that isn't in Rio's hair flies up to her own face, jams her thumb and forefinger in closed eyes to try and rid herself of the thought that there's a <em>reason</em> this feels so good—and it's because it's <em>Rio.</em> Even this—lazy morning sex wouldn't usually have her on her back, not even <em>trying</em> to exert control, not trying to flip their positions, get herself on top to ride their face until <em>she</em> decides they're done.</p><p><em>Fuck.</em> She's been missing out on a lot by not sleeping with her friends.</p><p>"You want something?" Rio mumbles against her, presses a kiss to her clit—the only touch it's had all morning, breathes out a laugh against her when Agatha's hips involuntarily twitch at the touch.</p><p>"You dick."</p><p>"You're very mean to me." Rio says, then pushes Agatha's thigh more towards her chest—a move she hadn't been anticipating, and with the newfound easier access, dips their tongue lower and <em>fuck,</em> inside.</p><p>It's not what Agatha was trying for but the <em>sounds</em> Rio's making as they push further into her cunt has her mind emptying of any thoughts past <em>Rio's inside me. Need them deeper.</em></p><p>And maybe Rio's willing to give her this. The thought of having Rio inside her, stretching her out surpasses any need to have their tongue on her clit. Suddenly, the only thing she wants is <em>Rio</em> as deep inside her as they can get—doesn't even care about her building orgasm as long as they fill her completely, the way she wants, needs—</p><p><em>"Shit,"</em> Rio groans, pants against Agatha's thigh and leaves her cunt devastatingly empty, "You that desperate for it?"</p><p>Agatha whines, blames the early morning sun cracking through the blinds, and the mind numbing orgasms from the night before for the words she'd <em>apparently</em> let slip from her lips, because <em>yes,</em> she <em>is.</em></p><p>And all of the overthinking she's been doing since Rio woke up this morning is silenced by the fingers they press to the entrance of her cunt, teasing her open.</p><p>She's just glad Rio can't tell she's just as contented by this—knowing they're going to fill all the gaps she has left, as she is by being granted an easy orgasm.</p><p>"Put your fingers inside me." She says, is <em>not</em> about to beg—she did enough of that last night.</p><p>Rio finally works <em>with</em> her and not against her, presses inside with two fingers, doesn't stop until they're at the knuckle, filling her easy.</p><p>They pump their fingers slowly—once, twice, and that's all it takes for Agatha to fist the sheets by her head with one hand, and Rio's hair with the other, "Another," She says, words coming up from the depths of her throat, "Another finger."</p><p>"Three? Already?" Rio says the words against her thigh. They're said like a question, but Agatha can feel the smirk against her skin, can hear the tease in their voice, "Greedy girl."</p><p>Agatha doesn't have it in her to disagree. Not when Rio pulls out, a third finger fitting next to the others and pushing back inside like they belong there—like the shape of Agatha's cunt was made to fit Rio inside.</p><p>She can feel herself clenching on Rio's fingers—like her body agrees and wants to keep them inside of her.</p><p>God, it's not gonna take long. She wants it, <em>needs</em> it now.</p><p>"Maybe next time," Agatha says like there's going to <em>be</em> a next time, "You can wake me up like this."</p><p>It's worth the unexpected ache in her chest to have Rio whine into her cunt at her words, and then <em>finally</em> lick over her clit.</p><p>Her back arches off the bed, she's probably near ripping out Rio's hair. She can't bring herself to care.</p><p>The fingers inside her start up a harsh rhythm, makes Agatha feel every inch that's inside of her completely, and it only takes seconds for her to fall over the edge into an orgasm that creeps up on her, crashes into it almost by accident.</p><p>Rio doesn't let up, fucks Agatha through her orgasm, their fingers keeping to the same speed as they suck her clit into their mouth. Part of her wants to back away from the feeling, try to stave off the rapidly approaching second orgasm, partly to protect her ego, and mostly because she doesn't want this to end.</p><p>She can't though, and her orgasm breaks over her, a near scream ripping from her throat. She feels it in every part of her body—toes curling in the sheets, thighs tensing in Rio's grip, back arched as the feeling zips up her spine, ears ringing as she rides it out.</p><p>Agatha will blame the way she's not long woken up for the tired that sits in her bones when she comes down, a happy hum escaping her lips when Rio shifts back up her body, gentle so they can keep their fingers inside her just a little longer. She's not sure if that part is for her or for them, but she's grateful—hates the feeling of being empty too soon after she's come.</p><p>Rio's face is shiny and their eyes are bright when Agatha takes them in. She keeps her arms by her sides so she doesn't slip up and let her happy buzzing body pull Rio in close like she'd allowed Rio to do with her last night.</p><p>"You taste so good." Rio says, slowly slips their fingers from Agatha's cunt, watches her jaw slacken at the feeling.</p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha says, swallows hard at the way her brain seems to record those words. She wonders if when they go to dinner at Wanda's later this week, and Rio has no reason to want her anymore, she'll still hear them echoing around her mind.</p><p>Rio hums, "Want a taste?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes drop to their lips; she can see herself all over Rio, imagines herself leaning up, tasting herself on Rio's lips, licking into their mouth and sucking on their tongue, and—</p><p>Fuck, <em>what?</em> She blinks, very pointedly averts her gaze to look into Rio's eyes and nowhere else. Surely Rio must know how the lines would blur if they kissed.</p><p>"No?" They say before Agatha can answer—a rarity since Agatha has made a habit since childhood of speaking before she thinks—mouth pulling in a disappointed line, "That surprises me."</p><p>And thank god Agatha hadn't said something stupid like <em>I can't kiss you because I think I might die if I do,</em> because Rio brings their hand up to their mouth and sucks just their forefinger into their mouth, takes it deep until their lips are touching their knuckle. They hum at the taste.</p><p>Agatha's hand shoots out and wraps around their wrist. That's <em>her</em> prize; they can't take it from her.</p><p>They raise an eyebrow at her but allow Agatha to pull their finger from their mouth. Agatha replicates their move—maintains eye contact as she takes just that one finger, slick with both her come and Rio's spit, deep into her mouth.</p><p>She smirks around it at Rio's slack jawed expression and when she backs off, leaving the tip just at her lips, decides to go straight in for the kill—lines the other two fingers that had been inside her up next to the first and takes them right down to the knuckle. Agatha hums around them when they touch the back of her throat; she shouldn't be surprised—she could feel <em>exactly</em> how long their fingers were when they were inside her last night, but she still hums her satisfaction at the happy buzzing it gives her brain.</p><p>Agatha bobs her head, cleans their fingers until she can no longer taste herself on them, pleased with the way Rio hasn't looked at her with anything but awe the entire time.</p><p>She's going to miss this.</p><p>"Fuck," Rio breathes, doesn't wipe their spit slick fingers on the covers, instead curls them into their palm as if they'd been given a gift, "You're perfect."</p><p>Agatha's heart seems to plummet down into the pit of her stomach at their words—sick and stupid.</p><p>She wants to tell Rio not to say those kinds of things to her—that's not the kind of relationship she has with any of the people she fucks. And yes, of course it gets a little tangled with how close they are, how much they love each other, but Agatha can't hear anything like that after they've had sex.</p><p>Instead, she clears her throat, looks Rio in the eye because it's not like she's uncomfortable or afraid to end this, and says, "I have work soon. I need to have a shower."</p><p>And Rio—kind and wonderful Rio doesn't say, <em>'Oh, so you're kicking me out', </em>or, <em>'Right, yeah, of course you do', </em>or, <em>'Don't bother calling',</em> like she was ever even planning on it.</p><p>No, Rio's big brown eyes just widen further as they grab her hand, thumb stroking over the back a few times before they shift to get out of bed, "Sorry, I didn't even realize," They say, start looking around for their clothes, "I usually know your work schedule better than this."</p><p>Agatha just watches, unable to even move from her bed as Rio gets dressed in last night's clothes. If she was more <em>in her body</em> she'd have offered Rio a pair of clean boxers from her drawer—what she likes to sleep in when she doesn't have someone in her bed.</p><p>She watches them pull their clothes back on, memorizes every bit of skin that gets covered up because she'll never get to see it again.</p><p>"Maybe I could take you out to dinner tonight?" Rio says when they're pulling on their shoes, "That Greek place you like?"</p><p>Agatha would <em>never</em> normally say no to that, but the idea of everything going back to normal <em>today,</em> and not even allowing herself the time to push the thought of Rio like <em>this</em> to the very back of her mind, has her shaking her head, "Another night?"</p><p>The light in Rio's eyes dims—she probably wouldn't even notice it if she hadn't got so used to looking into them in the past twelve hours, "Yeah," They still cross the room to come to her, cup her face in their hand, "I'll work around you."</p><p>"Soon, I promise." She says, allows herself to tilt her cheek into their hand. No one's ever done that before and it feels nice. Sue her. And then, as Rio's about to leave, she calls after them like a pathetic teenager, "I had fun last night."</p><p>Rio peeks their head around her doorframe, stupid, goofy grin plastered to their face, "And this morning, I hope."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "Well, yes."</p><p>"I know what you mean, though," Rio says, eyes shifting around the room, Agatha patiently waiting for them to find the right words, "Thank you for trusting me. I'd probably find trying new things with you easier too."</p><p>Agatha can only nod, is worried that if she tries to speak her voice will crack. She hadn't expected Rio to understand the gravity of submission for her, and her heart clenches at the acknowledgment.</p><p>And then they're gone, leaving Agatha in the sheets that smell so distinctly like the two of them together.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha considers not washing the sheets.</p><p>Which is ridiculous because they're in desperate need of it. But after Rio left, it didn't take long for her to realize that was her last opportunity to <em>touch</em> Rio, and she fucking blew it by kicking them out.</p><p>Rio's probably a <em>normal</em> level of freak <em>and</em> Agatha's best friend. She imagines they wouldn't take too kindly to Agatha curling back up in those sheets with her nose pressed to them.</p><p>So she doesn't. She fully intends to take this day as a full reset for her relationship with Rio.</p><p>And that works up until it doesn't. She's showered, washed her sheets, made a half-assed attempt at yoga to clear her mind, which didn't work at all when she got into the rabbit pose and swore she could feel Rio's hands on her hips like they had last night.</p><p>Maybe she should take up a new hobby. Something entirely unsexy—something like macramé. Agatha's fairly sure Rio remained a virgin throughout that whole obsession, so there must be some correlation.</p><p>And then, halfway through loading the dishwasher, Agatha gets slapped in the face with the memory of the words, <em>I'd probably find trying new things with you easier too,</em> and she almost drops a plate.</p><p>Because maybe she doesn't have to give this up. Maybe that was their way of letting Agatha know they'd be interested in doing this again—if there was something they haven't tried yet.</p><p>She spends the rest of the day in a sort of horny haze—thinking up things Rio might not have done before, and equally, things <em>she's</em> never tried, imagines them trying them together. It's important that she has the full picture before adding them to her list.</p><p>And that night she texts them, just to test the waters—keeps it relatively tame—</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>have you ever tried anal?</em></p><p> </p><p>It's tame compared to some of the other things that came to mind today. And it can potentially be read through the lens of a curious friend. Though she does quickly follow it up with—</p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>and if so giving or receiving?</em></p><p> </p><p>Because <em>god,</em> she wants to know.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>No</em><br/><em>To both</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip when she gets the response nearly half an hour later. Not that she's been keeping track of the time or checking her phone. No, she has better things to do than to constantly check whether Rio's messaged her back yet.</p><p>And it's a good job she <em>hadn't</em> been waiting because she doesn't know if it's the response she wants. Just a flat out no. Does that simply mean <em>no, they haven't tried it, </em>or, <em>no, and I don't want to try it with you?</em></p><p>Not that she was going to, but Agatha doesn't have to spend time trying to figure out her next move because another text chimes in from Rio.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>I'm interested</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>ok. good.</em></p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, maybe Agatha should have first figured out whether that meant Rio was interested with <em>her,</em> but then—</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>What about you?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>yes to both</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>I hope you're not disappointed with</em><br/><em>my lack of experience</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha slams her hand down on the sofa in the space next to her, triumphant grin on her lips. Okay, so that was more painless than she'd been anticipating.</p><p>She could be mean, but there's enough time for that later—times where it could be more fun for both of them.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>you could never disappoint me</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Over the next few days, Agatha hopes to interrupt Rio's day with messages that have them turning their notification previews off.</p><p><em>degradation. thoughts?</em> is sent just minutes after waking up.</p><p>She cackles to herself when she texts them <em>i've never been fisted before</em> when she knows Rio will be on their weekly call with their mom.</p><p>Their responses are mostly the same—some broken brain blabbering and then agreement. They <em>always</em> want to try whatever Agatha has to offer.</p><p>Agatha makes sure to send a text just after 10am on the Wednesday because she knows Rio's likely to be doing their grocery shopping. They don't explicitly confirm her suspicions, but she knows she's right when the answer to, <em>how do you feel about choking?</em> is—</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Shit</em><br/><em>Agatha</em><br/><em>Maybe a warning next time?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>where's the fun in that? :(</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Don't put the sad face, baby</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her face heat up—with anger—at Rio's use of the pet name, ignores it so she doesn't draw any attention to it.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>answer the question</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Choking on food is one of my least</em><br/><em>favorite things.</em><br/><em>But if you mea</em></p><p> </p><p>Hm. Agatha's mostly sure Rio hadn't meant to send that. She waits a few minutes, just stares at her screen to see if Rio messages again. It doesn't come.</p><p>She huffs, throws her phone away from her and goes to stare at the mostly empty contents of her fridge like the answer will be in there.</p><p>That doesn't stop her from near lunging for it when it buzzes again.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Oh oops</em><br/><em>Pressed send before I was done lol</em><br/><em>Bumped into Jen</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but tease a little,</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>omg are you texting me about</em><br/><em>choking me in front of jen?!</em><br/><em>dirty</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Oh, so that IS what you meant :o</em><br/><em>Never done it but yes I'm interested</em><br/><em>I'm maybe more interested in being choked</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>even better</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's list grows the more they talk, but she hasn't <em>seen</em> Rio since that morning. She likes to have a clear vision of what she's doing, and she's definitely not at all nervous, but her right thumb is coppery to taste whenever she brings it to her mouth with how much she's bitten it.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Are you free today?</em><br/><em>There's a witchcraft exhibition at the museum</em><br/><em>Can I take you?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>i can't today</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha's stomach turns as she presses send. It's stupid, but it sounds like a date. It <em>is</em> a date, really.</p><p>She remembers sitting on Rio's bed at college and distracting them from their studying with stupid questions instead of doing any of her own work. Discussing their perfect dates was obviously much more entertaining to Agatha.</p><p><em>"Um, I don't know. I've never really thought about it."</em> They'd said, not looking up from their laptop, <em>"What's yours?"</em></p><p>Agatha had hummed, said, <em>"Probably like a museum or something."</em></p><p><em>"Yeah?"</em> Rio had finally looked up at that, seemed amused, <em>"Would you be hoping your date buys you something from the gift shop after getting lunch in the little restaurant?"</em></p><p><em>"Fuck off,"</em> She'd said, cheeks heating up because that sounded really fucking nice actually, <em>"Your turn."</em></p><p><em>"Museum sounds nice."</em> They'd said with a shrug and went back to their studying.</p><p><em>"You can't steal my date."</em></p><p><em>"Why not?"</em></p><p>Agatha didn't really have a response to that. It seemed stupid to say she didn't like the thought of them taking another girl on <em>her</em> date. So she didn't.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>i'll see you tomorrow at wanda's right?</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Of course</em></p><p> </p><p>So it's fine then. Agatha doesn't <em>need</em> to see Rio before tomorrow anyway. She has a plan, and staring at wax models of Salem's finest probably isn't the place to ask Rio to throw her around a little.</p><p>And the ideal place is <em>obviously</em> Wanda's kitchen. Or bathroom. Or bedroom. Honestly, she's not too picky.</p><p>So she'll see Rio tomorrow and she won't have to worry about looking at Rio and thinking about them kissing her, <em>just</em> because her brain has an alert out for <strong><em>DATE SETTING.</em></strong></p><p>Agatha can be patient and normal about this.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio is already there when Agatha turns up, fingers drumming over the neck of their beer bottle and offering Agatha a small smile when she walks in. Agatha readies herself for the usual gentle hug but it never comes. Rio doesn't even stand to greet her—their only acknowledgement being <em>just</em> that smile.</p><p>And she'd have ignored it—Rio isn't <em>obligated</em> to greet her by wrapping their arms around her; no one else does. But then she <em>can't</em> ignore it when she drops her offerings of wine and peanuts off in the kitchen and Jen sidles up beside her, one eyebrow raised like she's some daytime television detective.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>Agatha very pointedly does not look at her, "What was what?"</p><p>"Are you and Rio fighting?"</p><p>That's not exactly what she'd call it. Though—if someone else noticed it then…</p><p>"Of course not." She says, looks Jen in the eye and tries to remember the normal amount of times to blink in a minute. Jen doesn't look convinced, "Your eyebrow is gonna get stuck like that." Agatha jabs at her.</p><p>Jen ignores that. Bitch. "So everything's normal with you and Rio?"</p><p>Well. She wouldn't exactly say that either. Agatha hopes the shiver that runs down her spine at the memory of Rio making her come with their strap buried deep inside her isn't noticeable.</p><p>"Yes," She sighs. And then, because she's apparently lost her mind to memories of <em>other</em> things, like the way Rio called her <em>baby,</em> and the way they pressed kisses to parts of her body that <em>weren't</em> her lips, and the way they seemed to know exactly what Agatha needed, and—well, she's out of it enough to say, "Why would you think that?"</p><p>Jen has looked at Agatha like she's insane, like she's scared of her, like she's unconvinced by everything she's saying. She's never looked at Agatha like she's stupid before.</p><p>"Because the two of you are worryingly paired at the hip. I've never seen Rio <em>not</em> try and cross a room to get to you once they've spotted you." Jen says, which doesn't at all help.</p><p>"That can't be true." Agatha says, but as soon as the words leave her lips she knows she's wrong. Rio always makes her feel special in that regard. No matter where they are, how many enemies she's made in the room, Rio will look at her like she could do no wrong—like they're <em>proud</em> to know her. They always head straight to her, even when Agatha can see they're in the middle of a conversation—like Agatha's someone important.</p><p>Fuck. Maybe they <em>are</em> fighting.</p><p>She clears her throat, "We're fine." She reiterates even though now she's not so sure.</p><p>And truth be told, she's maybe a little embarrassed, what with the way she'd prepared herself before coming out, just in case Rio had wanted to try something new tonight.</p><p>She should have gone to that stupid fucking museum.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Dinner goes fine.</p><p>Rio is sitting on the opposite end of the table. They <em>chose</em> to sit that far away from her. The thought sat heavy in Agatha's stomach for a while until they started speaking to her like everything was normal from across the table.</p><p>Agatha doesn't have a fucking clue what's going on.</p><p>So maybe she follows them to the bathroom when Wanda, Jen, and Alice are having the whole <em>to have children, or not to have children</em> debate. It's not as if it's looking like it's in the cards for her—she won't be missed from this conversation.</p><p>She tiptoes upstairs, just in case, and knocks on the bathroom door.</p><p>"Um," Agatha can hear Rio shuffling about, "One second."</p><p>"It's me." Agatha says, mostly in case Rio doesn't want to open the door to her.</p><p>They barely even take a second after that, wrenching the door open and pulling Agatha inside. It's a better reaction than she thought she was going to get.</p><p>"Agatha," They breathe, mouth widening into a bigger smile than she was greeted with, "Fuck, you look so good tonight."</p><p>Well, that she knows. She'd got dressed earlier with Rio in mind—purposefully accentuated her tits with her tight, long-sleeved deep v-neck to selfishly get their eyes on them. They hadn't looked once all evening, but now it's like they've been told they'll die if they look elsewhere ever again.</p><p>Which makes sense because the air is cooler in the bathroom than anywhere else in the house, and Agatha isn't wearing a bra. She's tempted to check, but the way Rio licks their lips as they stare tells her that her nipples are straining against the material.</p><p>"You barely even said hi to me earlier." Agatha says, doesn't sound petulant at all, doesn't lightly punch Rio's arm because <em>what the fuck was that about?</em></p><p>Rio shies away from Agatha's intense look, lets themself be backed up against the wall, "I didn't want to give us away."</p><p><em>Us.</em></p><p>Agatha knows what they mean, but her heart beats out of her chest for just a moment anyway.</p><p>"Right," She says. Maybe she'd overreacted. Whatever. She doesn't tell Rio that their friends had found it <em>more</em> suspicious, "So you still wanna…" She trails off—doesn't want to say something as juvenile as <em>hook up,</em> or,<em> do this—</em></p><p>"It's all I've been thinking about since I last saw you."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitches.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah," It's tantalizing, the way Rio's eyes drop to her lips like that's something they do, "You didn't make it easy to <em>not</em> think about you with all of those questions."</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Agatha says, presses forward, hips first, loves the way Rio looks leaning back against the wall like they'd let her ruin them, like they wouldn't even have any doubts about letting her.</p><p>"No?" Rio sounds amused, "Multiple messages a day asking my thoughts on wax play or spanking, or whatever, and you don't remember?"</p><p>Or maybe Rio's set on ruining <em>Agatha.</em> They've barely even said anything but the implication—knowing Rio's been thinking about the two of them trying everything she's messaged about. Her brain is unfortunately, embarrassingly, quite empty.</p><p>"I never asked you about spanking." She sounds like she smokes two packs a day and hasn't drank a glass of water in a year.</p><p>Rio hums, "Oh, that sucks," They say, which makes it sound like Agatha told them that a tv show they like is ending, "Are you not into that?"</p><p>"I'm into it." Agatha says, a little breathless.</p><p>Rio parrots her own words from her texts back to her, a little grin on their face like they know they have the upper hand. They shouldn't <em>have</em> the upper hand. "Giving or receiving?"</p><p>"Do you honestly think I've ever let anyone spank me before?"</p><p>Rio's face is gentle, "That's okay, we don't have to."</p><p>"Well I," God, it's so much more fucking embarrassing talking about this when she's the hypothetical sub, "I never said that. I want to try things with you."</p><p>Agatha doesn't like how calm Rio looks about all this, like this isn't a surprise, like they <em>know</em> Agatha wants to get bent over on her own bed and let Rio mark her, bruise her.</p><p>"Am I to trust that you'll do it right first time," She says, in the hopes to regain some sort of lead in the conversation, tilts her head just a little to look Rio in the eye as she presses a hand to Rio's stomach, presses her nails in—wishes their skin was bared, "Or do you need me to give a demonstration?"</p><p>She watches, unable to keep the sharp grin from her face, as Rio shivers, "I do have <em>some</em> experience here."</p><p>Agatha can feel her smile sliding down into a grimace, teeth still bared, "With <em>her?"</em></p><p>"Maria? Yeah."</p><p>Agatha digs her nails in, and with her other hand on their chest, shoves them further up against the wall, "I don't want to hear her name."</p><p>She knows Rio's not <em>hers.</em> She doesn't want them to be. She's never usually bothered about the people she's sleeping with having sex with other people. It's likely just that it's Rio, and there's feelings there—albeit platonic. She doesn't like the idea of sharing them now that they've fucked.</p><p>"Sorry," They say, and they do sound it, but there's a hint of arousal in their tone too, "If it helps, I've never used anything but my hand."</p><p>Fuck. It does help actually. With the angry buzzing in Agatha's brain anyway; not so much with her underwear. Rio hasn't even touched her but their words, the new thought of Rio bending her over their lap, paddle or crop in hand, has her pressing her thighs together.</p><p>God, she wouldn't even be entertaining the thought with someone else.</p><p>"I might have some toys for you to use."</p><p>Agatha can see Rio's throat bob at her words, "Just so we're clear, you're asking me these questions because these are things you want to do <em>with me,</em> right?"</p><p>The thought of saying no is funny—tempting, but Agatha just pulls her nails from where they're pinned in Rio's stomach, trails her fingers down to the hem of their t-shirt and strokes the skin of their hip. She missed out on a lot only getting to touch Rio during aftercare last time, "I've been making a list, pretty boy."</p><p>Rio whines, lets their eyes slip closed a little, <em>"Fuck,</em> Agatha, you can't just say things like that."</p><p>Agatha bites her lip like it's going to do anything to hide her smirk, "Why? Do you like it that much?"</p><p><em>"Obviously."</em></p><p>Rio's right. It <em>is</em> obvious.</p><p>She files that away for later.</p><p>"How do you feel about coming home with me tonight?" Agatha says, practically speaks the words into Rio's jaw, hadn't realized how close her face had gotten, "I can't stop thinking about the other night."</p><p>"You want me to tie you up again?"</p><p>Honestly, that hadn't been what Agatha was going for, had intended to try something new, but—</p><p>"Maybe I could teach you a new tie?"</p><p>Rio nods, eager, "Please. You looked so perfect the other night."</p><p>Being tied up again isn't exactly what she had in mind, but if it's what Rio wants, all this means is she has more time before her list runs itself down and Rio gets bored of her, like they do all their hobbies.</p><p>She lets out a sigh at the thought, brain whirring through all the ties she knows, pictures Rio once again with her rope in their hands. She shakes off the thoughts, grabs hold of Rio's wrist and checks the time on their watch.</p><p>"I give it an hour before we can leave," She drops Rio's arm back to their side. There's something satisfying about the way Rio lets themself be manhandled by Agatha, but is so comfortable taking control in bed. She'd honestly deluded herself into thinking they'd be solely submissive.</p><p>"What tie will you teach me?" Agatha can almost feel Rio's jittery excitement even though she's no longer touching them, "Just so I can prepare a little."</p><p>Agatha doesn't really know what that means, doesn't know how they're planning on preparing from Wanda's bathroom, but, "I was thinking a box tie, if you've never done one of them?"</p><p>Rio shakes their head, "I've done harnesses but never anything with arms as well," They let their eyes trail down Agatha's chest; she imagines they're picturing her all tied up so she does the kind thing and doesn't interrupt their staring, "Mar—" Rio cuts themself off, wide eyes jumping back up to Agatha's face like they're going to be scolded, <em>"She</em> was always more into the visual of the rope than actually being restrained."</p><p>Agatha hums, lets Rio's minor fuck up go, "That's good actually. A box tie shouldn't be too hard for you to learn then. We can keep it simple."</p><p>She also ignores the implication that, unlike Rio's ex, Agatha <em>wants</em> to be restrained. She can't exactly correct them after last time.</p><p>Agatha backs away to the door, but when she touches the handle, Rio says, "Wait." She looks at them over her shoulder, nerves set into their expression, "I just… I know you don't really do this, but I want this," They gesture in the space between them both, "To be exclusive. I know it's selfish but I don't want you to be with other people too."</p><p>It makes Agatha pause. She didn't consider the fact that Rio would think she'd still do her usual <em>one person alone won't satisfy me</em> thing. She doesn't think that would be true with Rio—not when she now has a plethora of things to try; not when Rio can give her what she wants and <em>needs—</em>neither dominant or submissive all of the time.</p><p>She crosses the room, cups Rio's face in her hands and makes sure to look them in the eye—not the same thing she'd pulled on Jen earlier, but just so they know she's being serious, "Why would I need anyone but you?"</p><p>The bathroom overhead lights are too harsh for the moment, but the depth of Rio's eyes make it feel like the most intimate place in the world. Rio breathes out a sigh, face softening and losing its tension. Their hands come to grip their hips, like they belong there—like they'd been holding themself back before, and their eyes drop to her lips.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha thinks they're going to kiss her. For a moment, she thinks she'd let them, if not for the horrific lighting ruining it a little for her. That and the fact that kissing Rio would be a terrible mistake. That's the main reason. The sole reason.</p><p>She clears her throat and like Rio knows exactly what she's thinking, they nod, release their grip on her hips and lets her leave.</p><p>Agatha resists the urge to lean her back against the newly closed bathroom door to collect herself like some sort of touch-starved damsel. Fuck, she really needs to grow up if she's going to take Rio home with her and not accidentally kiss them when she walks through the front door.</p><p>And she only has about ninety minutes to get that through her skull.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em>doesn't</em> kiss Rio the minute she drags them through her front door. She's since recovered her brain cells—maybe she was losing air in Wanda's tiny bathroom, maybe she has black mold growing and it affected her mind. She should let Wanda know. God, she's <em>such</em> a good friend.</p><p>As exhibited by her <em>not</em> kissing Rio when she pulls them to the stairs by their hand. If Rio was someone else, Agatha might have let herself push them against the door, crash her lips into theirs and taste the beer on their tongue. But they're not; they're Rio, and so she doesn't—just pulls them by their wrist up the staircase, giggles when they trip over a step in a bid to keep with her.</p><p>If Rio was someone else, she probably would have shoved them down onto her bed, straddled them, pinned their wrists to the bed as she kissed them, licked into their mouth.</p><p>She doesn't do any of that, of course.</p><p>She <em>does</em> shove them down onto her bed, but she stays standing, heads over to her closet where her toy chest is, pulls out two long lengths of rope, just in case one isn't enough, and also her safety shears. She debates over getting other toys out—a plug, a vibrator, maybe. She doesn't though.</p><p>This way she gets to see what Rio chooses to do, and isn't that what this is supposed to be about? Trying new things, and doing them differently? Agatha never would have let someone else dictate how she was going to get fucked before this thing with Rio sparked alight.</p><p>She heads back to the bed, rope in hand. Rio looks good waiting there for her. They're propped up on their elbows, just watching her, their legs spread. Agatha has the sudden urge to drop to her knees between them and let her mind empty as she takes their cock into her mouth.</p><p>Definitely black mold. Definitely telling Wanda.</p><p>"Thought I was gonna be in control again?"</p><p>Those words said in <em>that</em> position. God, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to her.</p><p>"Thought you were gonna be a good little student for me and learn this new tie?" Agatha says, drops the rope from the loose quick-release tie she stores it in, tries to wrench back any semblance of control.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio says, pushes themself up to sit and grab at the backs of Agatha's thighs now that she's close enough, "And I thought you wanted me to learn it so you sit there looking pretty and not have to think, sweetheart."</p><p>It takes a lot to keep the whine that wants to escape her throat at bay as she stumbles inelegantly forward at Rio's tug.</p><p>"Where the hell did you learn this shit?" She sort of regrets it after saying it because she knows the answer—Maria. Or some other woman who came before her that Agatha probably hated just as much because they were never ever good enough for Rio.</p><p>"Just made a guess at the type of things you'd like to hear," They say and lean in to press a kiss to Agatha's covered hip bone, "And I read a lot."</p><p>Agatha, who had been in the middle of letting herself relax into the feeling of Rio's lips pressed against her, head tilted back, lips curled into a satisfied slight smile, quickly drops her gaze back down, fists her hand in Rio's hair and tugs their head back to force them to look at her. "Rio, please tell me you're not recycling lines from your erotica."</p><p>"Not recycling," Rio says, eyes wide, then mumbles, "Maybe just inspired."</p><p>Agatha groans, though it could be worse—at least they're not recycled lines from one of Rio's past relationships. These are, fortunately, all just with Agatha in mind. Admittedly, she does enjoy the thought of Rio alone in their bedroom reading and thinking only of Agatha.</p><p>She doesn't want to talk about that anymore though, drops the rope and shears on the bed beside Rio and starts pulling the tight shirt over her head, throws it somewhere behind her, loves the way Rio wastes no time before surging forward and taking a nipple into their mouth.</p><p>She allows them, for a moment, lets her head drop back once more as a moan escapes her lips, keeps her hand loose in Rio's hair.</p><p>They're about to move to her other nipple when she tightens her grip, holds their head back, "I'm gonna go to the bathroom, and I'm gonna leave you with a video to watch while I'm gone. And when I'm back hopefully you'll have a basic understanding of how you're gonna tie me up."</p><p>Now, Rio looks particularly smug for someone who's letting their sub run the show so far, "I found one when you left me at Wanda's. I've watched it like twenty times tonight."</p><p><em>Motherfucker.</em></p><p>"Is that why you kept fucking disappearing?" She raises an eyebrow, tries not to look any ounce of impressed, "I thought you had a UTI."</p><p>"It doesn't actually look that complicated," Rio chuckles, leans forward in the grip Agatha hadn't realized she'd loosened in their hair, and plants a kiss to her bare stomach, "I thought you'd get like this," They say like there's parts of Agatha they know better than even she does, "It's harder to teach this one by just explaining, so I thought I'd do my own research first."</p><p>Agatha pushes her tongue into the side of her cheek—a habit she picked up from Rio.</p><p>Rio just smiles like they know Agatha appreciates this. And unfortunately for her, she does. "I made notes."</p><p>Agatha blinks down at them, "You made notes?"</p><p>"'Course," Rio says, fumbles to pull their phone from their pocket to show her, "So we don't have to watch the video, and we can just talk. Plus, I'm not a total beginner anymore, Agatha. I know what I'm doing."</p><p>She knows that. Of course she does, what with the way they bent her over last time, propped her up with pillows to support her chest and neck without having to be reminded, tied her wrists to her legs without missing a step, without fucking anything up, without forgetting to check in as they went.</p><p>Agatha thinks maybe she just doesn't like the idea of them gaining any new knowledge from the first time—when this was all innocent and she was showing them ties that boy scouts learn. Before they took that knowledge and used it on someone else, <em>developed</em> it with someone else.</p><p>They grab hold of her hips once again like it's their favorite place for them to be, strokes them with both thumbs, "You can still leave for a minute while I watch your video, if you want."</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "I wasn't really thinking."</p><p>Rio gently moves her back as they stand up. It's nice looking up at Rio.</p><p>"That's okay," They cup her chin, "You don't have to think right now, do you, baby?"</p><p>Her brain fucking short circuits hearing that. Once she's used to hearing <em>her</em> Rio saying things like that she'll be fine, but for now, all she wants to do is let them take control like they had last time.</p><p>So she stops thinking, takes Rio's shirt in her hands like she wants and starts tugging it over their head. They raise their arms to help her along, and then start unbuttoning Agatha's jeans once their shirt is off, Agatha's hands reaching to match them.</p><p>Once they're fully bare, Rio sort of sways towards her like they're going to kiss her—the headiness of the skin available to touch and the knowledge they're going to fuck obviously getting to them too.</p><p>Agatha looks away, reaches around Rio to grab one of the lengths of rope from the bed, "Come on then, pretty boy."</p><p>(She enjoys the way Rio softly groans, the thought crackles in the back of her mind that sometime soon, she'll have them at her mercy, will get to watch them react to all the names she'll call them when she's got them whimpering underneath her.</p><p>But that's for another time. And Agatha likes knowing there will <em>be</em> another time.)</p><p>"Still good to use the traffic light system?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"And your safeword?" Rio takes the rope from her hands, runs the length through their hands so that they're holding it comfortably, the bight between their fingers, ready to use.</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"Can you tell me what it is?"</p><p>Agatha nods, "Purple."</p><p>Rio smiles, obviously pleased, "Turn around for me, baby."</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> she really needs to get used to hearing them call her that soon. She could ask them to stop but—</p><p><em>Baby, baby, baby, baby.</em></p><p>Well. She won't.</p><p>She does as they ask, barely thinks about it.</p><p>"I didn't even have to tell you," Rio says, touches her forearms gently, and Agatha realizes only then that she's crossed her arms behind her back and assumed the box tie position, "Such a good girl."</p><p>Agatha's breath catches with that, is glad she's no longer facing Rio so they can't see the embarrassing flush on her face. She's never been called that before, she thinks she'd fucking remember.</p><p>"I'm gonna start with your arms now, okay, sweetheart?"</p><p>Agatha nods, but the rope never comes.</p><p>"Color, please?"</p><p>Oh.</p><p>"Green."</p><p>She's <em>very</em> green in fact.</p><p>And then Rio starts looping the rope around her arms—a firm tie but not cutting off any blood flow. She can hear them mumbling to themself as they work, catches the end of them quietly saying, <em>now a knot here,</em> which is more endearing than she'd expected to find it.</p><p>It's done much quicker than she's expecting, and soon the part Rio has least experience with is done and they bring the rope around her body, making sure to gently move her hair out of the way so it doesn't get tangled in any of the rope.</p><p>She keeps dropping her eyes to watch them work, largely because she didn't personally <em>pick</em> the tie. Rio was right, this <em>is</em> a simple one—rope just tied above her breasts and then below—a window rather than having them separated by more rope. Agatha should teach them something more intricate sometime, can imagine herself with patterns leaving marks on her skin.</p><p>She can't complain though, not when her mind grows as empty as it had been last time they did this, not when Rio's done such a good job, straight and comfortable lines cutting across her skin, unable to move her arms, tits pushed out with her arms held behind her back.</p><p>"God, you're beautiful." Rio breathes once they've finished, standing in front of Agatha once more. They're the first words they've said to her that aren't about the tie or her comfort, and it's like they've set themself a goal to see how red they can get her face.</p><p>She swallows, doesn't know what to do with that so shakes the compliment off and diverts their attention, "Box ties are fun because you might notice I can still move, unlike last time." She grins, raises an eyebrow, "More positions."</p><p>Rio has a faraway look in their eye. Agatha swears she can see herself in them—in the ways Rio's imagining her.</p><p>"What did you have in mind?"</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, "Thought you were supposed to be in charge, big boy?" She likes the way that grabs their attention, keeps going, "Or are you not capable of that now my tits are in your face?"</p><p>Rio's smile is soft but their eyes are sharp when they grip her chin, "God, you're so desperate to not be in control for once, aren't you?</p><p>"I—"</p><p>"Come on, baby," They say because they know her better than anyone, "That's what all this is, isn't it? You want someone who can put you in your place. You want someone you can trust to switch your brain off around, don't you?"</p><p>Agatha tries to speak, she swears she does but some sort of strangled whine gets released in place of words.</p><p>"It's okay," The thumb from the hand holding her chin comes across to press against Agatha's mouth. Instincts take over and she takes the tip of Rio's thumb just barely between pouty lips, "Do you wanna get on your knees for me?"</p><p>It's phrased like a question, but not said like one. It's said like Rio is peeling back the layers of Agatha's brain and picking out her deepest desires, "Do it then. Kneel for me."</p><p>And she does—thuds to her knees so she can please Rio. Rio can't leave if she's doing everything they ask.</p><p>"Easy, baby." Rio's face flickers when she drops to the floor, "Don't hurt yourself."</p><p>"Fuck off. I'm fine." Agatha snaps, feels the clouds over her mind clear a little.</p><p>"That's not very nice," Rio says, runs their fingers through Agatha's hair, across her scalp, and her eyes slip shut as she leans into the touch, "Do you feel better on your knees?"</p><p>Agatha glowers up at them—though doesn't quite know if it has the same effect as usual from where she's kneeling with her arms bound behind her back.</p><p>"No? You gonna ignore me?" Rio says, voice low and amused, "And I was gonna be so nice to you too."</p><p>Agatha's brain latches onto that—the need to ask jamming into her like she's a pincushion for her thoughts, "What—" Her words come out a little stuck, and so she swallows, tries again, "What were you gonna do?"</p><p>Rio's eyes gleam and they step away from Agatha to sit on the edge of her bed, just like last time, leaning back a little, legs spread, which is a little unfair in Agatha's opinion.</p><p>Admittedly, she's a little distracted by the thick, dark hair between Rio's legs, the happy trail that connects it on show as they wait for Agatha to finish her staring, "Was gonna let you touch me like you said you wanted."</p><p>"How am I gonna touch you with no hands?"</p><p>"What do you think you're on your knees for?"</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath in through her nose, <em>"Fuck, I</em>—" Even being on her knees, she hadn't expected it to be heading this way, "I want my mouth on you."</p><p>"Then you can be a good girl and tell me how you're feeling, can't you baby?"</p><p>God, <em>that's</em> a lethal combination. She finds herself wanting—more than power, more than control, more than anything right now—to hear that again. The way her brain reacts to those words is fucking addictive in ways Agatha didn't ever think she'd experience.</p><p>"It feels good," She says, shuffles forward to get closer to Rio once more, heat prickling up the back of her neck as she sees herself from outside of her own body for a moment and part of her wants to force herself to her feet, angry that she's forced to move on her knees—only a step above <em>crawling</em> to Rio. That part of her is very small though, and overpowered by her need to be <em>close.</em> "It feels good to just <em>do."</em></p><p>Rio nods like they know what she means and watches Agatha, now between their legs, rest her head on their thigh, face turned enough to press the corner of her mouth to their skin.</p><p>"I wasn't sure how not into being touched you were." Agatha says, recalls Rio's words from the time she tied them up in demonstration.</p><p>"I like it when I get to choose how." They bite their lip, eyes darting around Agatha's face like they want to keep looking at her but aren't sure how.</p><p>"You're lucky then," Agatha mumbles against Rio's skin, "Liking being told what to do is a more recent development." A more <em>Rio</em> development is probably more accurate. She takes a deep breath, the smell of Rio's skin is obvious, but not as much as the smell of their arousal—not when Agatha is this close, "Let me get my mouth on you."</p><p>She edges closer to the apex of Rio's thighs, feels the clouds settle steadily over her brain the closer she gets.</p><p>"Ask nicely, baby."</p><p>Maybe if she'd done this before she'd have more self restraint. But since her own orgasm is the only thing she's tasted off Rio, she's not looking to leave it up to imagination much longer, eyes fluttering shut and rocking forward, "Please."</p><p>"You can do better than that." They say because they're extraordinarily <em>cruel,</em> "And open your eyes this time, sweetheart."</p><p>Agatha's brought herself so close to them that she can stuff her head into their lower stomach to whine into the skin there. Rio waits out her brief tantrum, only reaches out to wrap a lock of Agatha's hair around their finger.</p><p><em>"Please</em> let me eat you out," She says, looks up at them from between their legs, "Rio, <em>please,</em> I wanna taste you on my tongue. I wanna be able to taste you every time I think of you."</p><p>It's a level of desperation usually reserved for non-Agatha people, but <em>fuck,</em> she <em>needs</em> this.</p><p>It's almost enough just to receive Rio's proud gaze, but then they mutter, "Such a good girl for me." And fist into Agatha's hair to pull her in.</p><p>Agatha goes willingly, doesn't want to fight it, isn't in any position to tease. She noses through their hair, moans at the taste of them—so strong it's in the air even before she licks through them.</p><p>Agatha likes to take her time, spread out her partner, push their thighs apart so that she can <em>see</em> them. She likes to have them begging, even if not with words, to get her mouth on them. It's a reward, of course.</p><p>It's not like that with Rio. Her mind empties of anything but Rio's taste as soon as her tongue is on them; she doesn't waste any time committing the way they feel against her mouth to memory.</p><p><em>God,</em> the feeling of them dripping for her is unparalleled—knowing how much they want her. She buries her face deeper, hands flexing for the first time against her rope, wants them freed so that she can reach up Rio's body, brush over their abs with her fingers, feel them twitch into her mouth from the touch.</p><p>The thought of how wet Rio had got from tying her up is particularly potent—it clings to the hair Agatha buries herself in—not that it's anything but a good thing, she wants to be covered in Rio.</p><p>She's usually talkative too, with other people. With Rio, she can't bring herself to tear away from their taste for long enough to even take solid breaths, nevermind start denying herself of them with <em>words.</em></p><p>They start to get a little restless after a while, breath coming in shorter pants, hand periodically flexing in her hair and pulling her in even closer, and that's when she wraps her lips around their clit and sucks.</p><p>"Oh <em>fuck,</em> Agatha—"</p><p>Her name is choked out on Rio's tongue, and <em>god,</em> she loves the way it sounds. Agatha keeps sucking on Rio's clit, manages for the most part to keep her tongue away from it. It doesn't seem to matter though—Rio's hips slam up into her face, as they come.</p><p>And Rio, even though they've just been barrelled over by their orgasm, tries to keep their hips pressed to the bed, tries to stutter out a mid-orgasm apology that Agatha is <em>not</em> having. She just presses herself further against Rio and breathes through the new coppery smell in her nose.</p><p>Once their orgasm subsides, Rio shakily sits up a little—puts their abs to good use to hold themself up as they cup Agatha's face in their palms.</p><p>"Baby, let me…" They trail off as they check her face over.</p><p>"Did you break my nose, Rio?" Agatha pants, licks her lips for more <em>Rio</em> since she was unwillingly pulled away, "I happen to like my nose."</p><p>"Me too," Rio mumbles, almost imperceptibly—like it wasn't really a conscious response made for Agatha's ears, "You look fine. There's no blood."</p><p>Agatha hums, "Yeah, that wouldn't be my first choice in ways you could make me bleed."</p><p>Rio's face is already red from exertion, but their ears pink a little further and they stammer without making any real progress with any sort of language.</p><p>"Lay back down, I wasn't done."</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"Come on," Agatha intends for her voice to drop low and sultry, thinks instead it comes out a little impatient, a little whiny, "Let me make you come again."</p><p>Rio hums, leans back on one elbow and brings Agatha's head back between their thighs, where she <em>needs</em> to be.</p><p>It doesn't take long to build them up this time, she can tell. Their thighs start to shake after only a minute, and the hand that was in her hair leaves to white knuckle the bed sheets.</p><p>Agatha's sure to flick her tongue over their clit this time with her lips wrapped around it—hadn't expected them to come before she could deploy that move.</p><p>It proves overwhelming for them, and they let out a rumbling groan as they come once more.</p><p>Agatha stays there, mouth working them softly through their orgasm. <em>God,</em> she'd fucking <em>kill</em> to shove her hand between her own thighs right now. Her motions become more open mouthed kisses against them more than anything after a while, until they push Agatha's head away, with a breathless, "I can't."</p><p>Honestly Agatha's happy staying on her knees, but Rio seems to be the needy type after they come, wants her close. She's not about to argue with the way the encourage her to stand, hands solid on her body and helping steady her without the use of her own.</p><p>They pull her onto the bed, let Agatha straddle one of their thighs. She thought it best if they want her near.</p><p>Rio looks at her like no one ever has before—a look sort of like awe that renders her speechless.</p><p>In fact, there's nothing going on with Agatha beyond the startling realization that she wants to <em>kiss</em> Rio—if only to put their own taste back in their mouth. She hadn't realized she'd rocked so close to them until her eyes drift up from Rio's face to their deep brown eyes and finds them looking at her own lips.</p><p>She doesn't mean to but she hears herself whisper <em>please</em> and lets Rio close the gap between them like they'd only been waiting for her to ask.</p><p>It starts softer than Agatha would have expected when she still has Rio's come in her mouth—just a gentle joining of their lips. And then they pull back, just enough for their eyes to lock. There's something <em>raw</em> there; Rio must see it reflected in her own eyes because after that initial kiss, they come back together messily, Agatha not wasting any time to push her tongue into Rio's mouth.</p><p>They moan—at Agatha's tongue in their mouth or the taste of themself on her tongue, she doesn't know. The reason doesn't matter so much as the vibration she can feel as their teeth clash.</p><p>It's like they've been starved of each other, even though this only started not even a week ago, the way they don't come up for air, the way there's no space between their bodies—not with the way Rio has their arms wrapped around her back. It helps keep her steady when she almost fully topples onto Rio without the use of her hands.</p><p>Rio's panting when they break apart, and she looks at them long enough without any exchange of words to realize she is too. And they're smiling.</p><p>"I can't believe that was the first time we kissed."</p><p>Agatha doesn't know why. It's not like they've had much reason to before. And honestly, if it hadn't been for the way the stopper has been unceremoniously pulled from her inhibitions, she probably would have held off for longer.</p><p>So she doesn't answer—doesn't know if anything she could say would be right, and seeks to change the subject entirely, "I need you to fuck me."</p><p>The smile barely fades from Rio's face as they press a kiss to her jaw. Agatha can feel the curve of their lips against her skin, "How do you want it?"</p><p>They keep trailing kisses—from jaw to cheek to lips, because that's something they do now apparently.</p><p>Agatha's not in much of a position to think and so her answer comes as the only thing that feels right, "Strap." She mumbles against Rio's lips, doesn't want to say too much and break the kiss too soon.</p><p>The kiss ends with Rio helping Agatha to move off their lap. Which she'd maybe fight harder if she didn't know they were going to do as she'd asked and strap up.</p><p>They leave her on the bed, kneeling and watching Rio cross the room to her own toy chest like they own it, cranes her neck to see them pull the harness up their hips and then gets a wonderful view of their ass as they bend over to look through her collection.</p><p>She presses her thighs together in anticipation, feels the slick that's dripped from her cunt against them as she watches Rio fit a strap into the harness.</p><p>"You can use other things too. If you want." Agatha says, can't stop herself, itches to be <em>full</em> after not having Rio in her at all yet. For as much as she loved getting to <em>finally</em> eat Rio out, she's hyper-aware that they've come <em>twice</em> when the most she's been touched was to tie her up.</p><p>Rio hesitates, keeps their back to Agatha, "What sort of things?"</p><p>Agatha swallows, brain and throat caramelized in the same way as she thinks about everything she owns, "Whatever you want that's in there," She wants, first and foremost, to know what <em>Rio's</em> choice is, "I'll tell you if I don't want it. Traffic lights. Remember?"</p><p>She can see the tension in Rio's back lessen at that and they lean back down to the chest.</p><p>It's funny, they must have something in mind—something they'd seen before, because they don't rummage. They turn back to Agatha with a satin pouch in hand. She knows what's in that one.</p><p>"I haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it here last time," They say, take a few steps towards Agatha, who can't do much except stare at the bag, imagining Rio pushing the purple jewelled heart plug inside of her. They must mistake her silence for uncertainty because they sound a lot less sure of themself when they say, "We don't have to use the strap at the same time. We don't have to use this at all."</p><p>"No," Agatha says, almost cuts off the end of Rio's words, "I want it," She swallows heavy, clarifies, "I want them both."</p><p>Rio's lips part, a breath escaping as they come closer to the bed, "You ever done this before?"</p><p>"Not with another person."</p><p>"Not with…" Rio's voice is barely louder than a whisper as they repeat her own words, "By yourself?"</p><p>Agatha only nods.</p><p><em>"Fuck,</em> Agatha," Rio sounds pained, "The thought of you—" They cut themself off. It's cute that they can't talk about her fucking herself when she's got the plug inside of herself when they're about to do it themself. "I um. I've never… done this. What do you need from me?"</p><p>That's one of Agatha's favorite things about Rio—always asking how they can help, what she needs from them, never makes her needs feel like burdens. It's something Agatha wouldn't pride herself on.</p><p>"I was maybe sort of hoping for something like this," Agatha admits, "I might have prepared a little earlier. Just in case."</p><p>Rio's jaw drops a little, the shape their eyes sit at drops a little, makes them look less contained.</p><p>And Agatha likes the way it looks, is about to tease them but they get there first, "You hoped I'd fuck your ass?"</p><p>Agatha won't lie about this, "Yes. Please."</p><p>Rio runs their hand over their face, eyes to the ceiling and Agatha waits unmoving until they're back on her. They move to the bed, grab two of Agatha's pillows and stacks them in the middle of the bed, encourages Agatha to bend over and rest her head against them.</p><p>She doesn't <em>want</em> them to move away and she whines when she feels them leave the space next to her.</p><p>"Relax, baby," They say, voice smooth, "I'm just grabbing lube."</p><p>She's a little embarrassed that all it took was Rio being away from her for a few seconds to have her whining, but then Rio's hands are on her hips, and then her ass, spreading her, and her body forgets how humiliation works.</p><p>One of Rio's thumbs is decidedly closer to her ass than the other and she tries to back herself into the touch.</p><p>Rio doesn't let her, of course, removes the touch entirely as Agatha is forced to listen to the cap of the lube bottle pop open, and the subsequent slick noises of them lubing their fingers up.</p><p>And then all she knows is the press of a single finger.</p><p>Rio's hands are warm, she thinks stupidly, one big hand resting on the small of her back, as their finger presses just barely inside her, just to the first knuckle. Somehow it feels <em>more</em> when it's Rio's instead of her own.</p><p>"Color?"</p><p><em>"Green."</em> Agatha breathes out, no need to even <em>think</em> about it, tilts her head to press her face further into the bed when she feels Rio's finger press deeper inside her.</p><p>They go slow, pump that single finger inside her without any ounce of the urgency Agatha is feeling. When she feels them pull back enough to line up a second finger, she grows a little restless, pushes back as soon as the tips of both fingers are inside her, catches Rio off guard enough for her to take them almost to the knuckle.</p><p>Rio just lets out a bark of laughter before moving the hand from her back. The sound of the smack registers just before the sting, the pleasure of it. Agatha drools into her pillow, feels her cunt clench around fucking <em>nothing.</em></p><p>"Greedy girl." Rio says, spanks her again to punctuate their words, "If you're that ready for it…"</p><p>Rio pulls their fingers out, and Agatha is about to protest until she hears the cap of the lube opening once more and settles.</p><p>She waits for it, more patient than she's maybe ever been for anything in her life, and then her reward—the metal of the plug pressing against her. She stays quiet, doesn't want to give Rio any reason not to let her have this, and in return, gets the brain slowing feeling of the plug stretching her out.</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> Agatha gasps, has no need to say it, doesn't have anything to tell them, ask them, just likes the feel of their name on her tongue.</p><p>Rio seems to understand, the hand that had spanked her moves to her back once more, strokes over the skin in a soothing motion as the plug easily slides inside her.</p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Rio breathes when it's all the way in, "You don't understand how fucking good you look."</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> Agatha says again—a plea this time.</p><p>"I know, baby. I've got you." They say, even when they <em>don't</em> fill her cunt, which is fucking rude.</p><p>Instead, they fit a hand under her chest and start to tug her up. Agatha goes with them, finds herself kneeling once more, the plug shifting inside her with the movement.</p><p>"You literally had me bent over and you're choosing <em>not</em> to fuck me like this?" Agatha grits out.</p><p>Rio's voice is deep in return when they move around the bed to face Agatha once more, like they can't contain their arousal enough to keep their voice at a clear pitch, "Wanna see how long you can ride me for before you can't hold yourself up."</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p><em>Fuck.</em></p><p>Agatha's eyes drop to their cock, looking more like <em>theirs</em> than it had ever looked <em>hers.</em></p><p>"Let me get you ready." She says, digs her nails into her forearms because it's the only fucking thing she has access to.</p><p>Rio doesn't let her move from the bed though, "I don't want you to hurt yourself if you're on your knees for that long again."</p><p>"We're still in our twenties, Rio."</p><p>"Yeah, and I heard your knee click when you stood up before," Rio says, evil, "Come on, baby." They grip hold of Agatha's hip in one hand, hold her back steady with the other as they encourage her to straddle them. She goes to line herself up with the tip of their cock immediately, but Rio's hands are strong on her hips, stopping her.</p><p>"Rio, do <em>not</em> tease me right now," Agatha says, teeth together, feels herself clench once more around nothing but the plug inside of her. And it's far from the biggest one she has, does nothing to make up for the fact she's being denied Rio's cock, "I've waited long enough."</p><p>"You said you wanted to get me ready," Rio says, looks smug as they encourage Agatha to grind against their solid length, "So get me ready."</p><p>Agatha's hips start moving before her brain takes in the instruction, getting Rio's strap wet with nothing but her own slick.</p><p><em>They have no reason to make her do this,</em> the usually sane voice in Agatha's voice tells her, <em>they have lube right in their reach. They're demeaning you by making you do this.</em></p><p>But it's not loud enough to cover up the feral demon banging around her brain saying, <em>let them take you, let them have you, let them own you.</em></p><p>And so she commits herself to grinding herself against them—the only touch her cunt has had all night.</p><p>After a while though, she grows restless, though not from the idea that Rio's trying to purposely demean her, and more from the way she thinks she might grind herself into an orgasm before she even gets them inside her, "Rio, please," She wants <em>desperately</em> to have them inside her, to come on their cock, "You wanna be inside me, right?"</p><p>Rio sucks on their teeth, the picture of someone level and unbothered by Agatha's display, "I don't know if you're ready for me yet. You were so <em>tight</em> for me last time, I don't wanna hurt you."</p><p><em>They're just teasing you,</em> the more composed voice speaks evenly, <em>it'll be a stretch with the plug but not enough to really hurt.</em></p><p>But that's not the voice that wins.</p><p>"I don't care," Agatha sobs—sobs, really, "Make it hurt," She tucks her head between the junction of Rio's neck and shoulder, "Make me <em>yours."</em></p><p>That's what gets Rio, ultimately, and they lift her up, hands cupping her ass as they help line her up with their strap.</p><p>The stretch is unreal; it's everything she needs. She's suddenly grateful for the lack of touch her cunt has been granted—doubts it would feel quite the same if she'd been built up. It's just another example of Rio knowing her needs before she does.</p><p>When she's fully in Rio's lap, all Agatha knows is the absolute fullness of having them in her cunt with the plug in her ass, can barely force the muscles in her legs to lift her up without Rio's help.</p><p>It blurs a little after that, Rio helping her sink onto their strap over and over again as her brain empties, keeps her upright with a careful hand on her back.</p><p>Agatha doesn't think she's ever sped to an orgasm this fast before. She always makes sure to take her pleasure, of course, but it is orchestrated. Nothing before has ever been like sex with Rio. The head-emptying feeling she gets when she's with them is like nothing she's ever felt before; pleasure isn't pre-meditated—she doesn't know exactly how many orgasms she's going to get tonight because <em>she's</em> decided.</p><p>Even when Rio says, "You can come as many times as you want, baby. You've been such a good girl for me." She doesn't know—isn't in her brain enough to <em>choose</em> how many times she wants to come, will let it happen until she physically can't.</p><p>Agatha <em>sobs</em> against their neck, nips at the skin there and then crashes into her first orgasm—trusts Rio to keep her upright when she crumbles.</p><p>When she comes back to herself, Rio is helping move her, hands on her hips and grinding up into her to push her towards her second orgasm. It won't take long, just with the sheer show of strength alone. Agatha has <em>just</em> enough awareness to have the thought that maybe she should have been skipping her yoga class to do deadlifts or whatever the fuck with Rio instead, before their lips press against her neck in what Agatha hopes it a kiss biting enough to leave a mark for days to come. And it's this that has her coming again.</p><p>Rio doesn't let up, keeps to their promise to let her come as many times as she wants, trusts that she'll tell them when she's done.</p><p>A third orgasm comes with them pressing on the jewel base of her plug, and a fourth when they pull it out just enough for the widest point to stretch her open, holds it there for a moment with their cock buried inside her, and then pushes it back inside when she <em>begs</em> to have it back.</p><p><em>"Rio."</em> She says, when she's unable to hold herself up any longer, sunk into her best friend's neck, tears starting to track down her cheeks with the want to <em>touch</em> Rio, to hold them close.</p><p>"Are you done?" Rio says, gentle.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head a little, "I just—" She cuts herself off at the thought of having to tell them she wants to be fucked in <em>missionary.</em></p><p>"You have to use your words, sweetheart."</p><p>She bites into Rio's shoulder, and in a quiet voice says, "Can you untie me?"</p><p>Rio gets it then—helps Agatha lift up and gently puts her down face first in the bed, unties the rope with ease as they mutter things like <em>my good girl, you've done so well,</em> and most notably, <em>I love you.</em></p><p>Then the rope is gone, Rio helping to unfold her arms from where they've been held behind her back, and massaging them lightly.</p><p>"Rio, <em>please."</em> Agatha gasps wet into the pillow, doesn't want Rio to think she wants to be done yet—not when she was promised all the orgasms she wants, and she wants another.</p><p>"I've got you, my love." Rio says, which doesn't help the tears. They roll her gently over onto her back, and her heavy arms lift to wrap around their neck with the <em>need</em> to have them close.</p><p>Rio pushes back inside—the feeling different now she's had them inside for so long. She only knows it feels <em>right.</em></p><p>One of Rio's hands is in her hair—not gripping, just holding, and the other strokes down her body until they reach her neglected clit.</p><p>The lack of touch it's had this whole time has her shivering through what she knows to be her final orgasm of the night, pulling Rio close into a kiss that's more just her breathing into their mouth.</p><p>There must be something that happens in the time between her orgasm coursing through her veins and Rio easing the strap out, pressing kisses to her wet cheeks as they massage her tight shoulders, but she doesn't quite know what.</p><p>"You're so perfect," They tell her when they help her roll over, "You did so good tonight." They say when they start to ease the plug out. The words heat her up—not in her lower belly, but in her chest—somewhere around her heart.</p><p>And, <em>god,</em> she just lets herself sink into the feeling, lets herself be loved for once.</p><p>She'll let them take care of her in the literal sense—a bottle of cold water from the fridge, a snack, a bath maybe—later. For now, Agatha just turns her head into Rio's arms, nuzzles until they get the idea and cover her with their own body.</p><p>(She tells herself that four—five? orgasms are enough to make anyone a little more needy.</p><p>She tells herself that it's the reason her heart swells with the need to tell Rio she loves them—really loves them.</p><p>Because that would be a ridiculous thing to tell someone she's only slept with three times, and so can't be true.)</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Days later, Agatha <em>does</em> let Rio take them to that museum. She probably has a much better time than she would if she were actually on a date, so she's glad it's them.</p><p>They do half the museum before circling back to the restaurant—Rio telling her to grab whatever table she wants, knows she's picky about where she sits, what way she's facing, and orders for both of them. Agatha trusts them to get her something she'll like.</p><p>Her eyes go between her phone and Rio—texts with Alice pulled up for nothing but cover, honestly, when a shadow blocks her light.</p><p>A woman with bright eyes smiles down at her, and Agatha knows something's not right when she doesn't immediately collate a list of ways to make sure she's in this woman's bed by the end of the day.</p><p>"This seat taken?" She says, and Agatha doesn't even get the chance to answer that it is, before Rio's all but slamming the tray onto the table, spilling a little of their coffees over the lip of the mugs.</p><p>"It is." They say, no room for argument. Agatha doesn't need them to fend anyone off for her, but she won't say it's not appreciated.</p><p>"Right," She says, spares Rio no more than a glance, "And are <em>you</em> taken?"</p><p>Rio cuts in once again, "She is."</p><p>"Maybe wanna let your friend answer?"</p><p>"Sorry," Rio says, sickening smile on their face—one they probably got from Agatha at some point, "Maybe I wasn't clear. She's mine."</p><p>Agatha's spine tingles with their possession—loves it but knows she can't, knows realistically there's nothing stopping her from getting this woman's number.</p><p>The knowledge doesn't stop her from reaching out across the table, and resting her hand on Rio's, thumb stroking over the skin.</p><p>The unimportant, nameless woman leaves when Rio sits down.</p><p>"Rio, you didn't have to—"</p><p>"I didn't like her," They huff, empty a sugar sachet into Agatha's coffee, "She can't—"</p><p>"I get it," Agatha interrupts, "You're a good best friend." The words leave her throat like the scrape of tiny knives, "The <em>best</em> best friend." She doubles down, grin on her face she hopes looks real.</p><p>Because it's been days of mind blowing, heart clenching sex, where Agatha doesn't know how to put her feelings to the side until it's over. And unfortunately, somewhere, somehow, she thinks she's fallen in love with Rio.</p><p>Rio blinks at her, and for a moment she thinks she might have said something wrong, "Best friend." They repeat.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha says, finds herself fighting against tears in the stupid bright museum restaurant, "You'll always be my best friend."</p><p>She just hopes that she gets over them before they get bored of her.</p>

<p>There's a sick sort of feeling in the pit of Rio's belly; has been since they woke. It swirls in time with the way they stir their coffee until it whirlpools enough for them to pour a little creamer in—how they've always done it.</p><p>It's a quiet morning. When they have the time, they like to open their windows, listen to the birds for a while before running their fingers over the spines of the records on their shelf as if picking one at random—even though they know the order by heart now.</p><p>Rio likes to fake spontaneity, likes to imagine that maybe they could be more like Agatha.</p><p>In all honesty, the only spontaneous things Rio has ever done have been because of Agatha—brain switching off a little more around her, just enough to not overthink too much.</p><p><em>("Tell me now," Agatha says, holds back a laugh as she holds a knife up to Rio, "Are you really an old man disguised in a hot, young body?"</em></p><p><em>Rio feels the blush heating their cheeks before they can even think to try to hide it, "What do you mean?"</em></p><p><em>"Rio," Agatha sighs as if exasperated, though Rio knows she probably isn't, "Your morning routine is talking to the birds that nest in the tree outside your window, playing one of your </em>many <em>records, and doing a crossword from your fucking little book of crosswords."</em></p><p><em>"So?"</em></p><p><em>"That's what old people do," Agatha drags out the 'ooh' like she's a child throwing a tantrum, "I deserve a little honesty."</em></p><p><em>Rio grins, "You're just jealous.")</em></p><p>Rio's bar for spontaneity sits comfortably somewhere around having toast for breakfast on a day they'd usually have cereal. Agatha likes to push that. Rio lets her. They don't remember the last time Agatha encouraged them to do something on par with having sex with someone just <em>on a whim.</em></p><p>For good reason, Rio's brain jabs.</p><p>And it's not wrong; spontaneity causes carelessness, and carelessness causes mistakes.</p><p><em>"You're a good best friend," </em>They hear, mind and belly swimming, <em>"The </em>best<em> best friend."</em></p><p>It's entirely Rio's fault. It's on them for not checking Agatha's feelings aligned with their own, for not cutting this whole thing off when it rooted and threatened to grow into something more. Rio has had two nights and a morning of amazing sex and didn't once think to check how Agatha <em>I-don't-do-relationships</em> Harkness was feeling about it all.</p><p>So Rio sits in the quiet of the morning, doesn't want the normalcy of hearing the birds, of listening to one of their favorite albums. They just sit in the stillness with their own thoughts, feeling fucking <em>guilty</em> instead.</p><p>If Rio had been honest from the start—honest about their feelings for Agatha—then she never would have asked for Rio to tie her up, certainly wouldn't have taken her clothes off, asked for Rio to touch her.</p><p>And naively, Rio had thought Agatha felt the same, had been so fucking <em>happy</em> when Agatha easily agreed to be exclusive. It's obvious to them now that it didn't even cross her mind that Rio was asking for the beginnings of a relationship. Agatha has always been very open about her lack of desire for a romantic relationship; she has sex without feelings all the time. Rio doesn't know why they thought it would be different with them.</p><p>Rio's phone buzzes on the kitchen counter where they'd left it, breaks the silence. They contemplate leaving it but their fingers itch with the need to check it—at least ninety percent sure it's Agatha. And Rio is and always has been weak for her.</p><p><strong><em>Agatha</em></strong><br/><em>can i come over?</em></p><p>Rio bites their lip, puts their phone down without replying, just stares as another message comes through.</p><p><strong><em>Agatha</em></strong><br/><em>i want to see you</em></p><p>Rio imagines breaking things off with her; throwing out some explanation that isn't quite the whole ugly truth of it. They reason that it's better to quit while they still can—before it gets too much for both of them, goes too deep. If they were a better adjusted person, maybe they might. But since they're not—</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio would like to say they managed to resist Agatha's charms, and that they tried very hard to break things off—<em>Agatha, we need to talk.</em> But the truth is that they haven't had a coherent thought, haven't said even a single word to her since she barrelled through their apartment door.</p><p>Agatha—the more talkative of the pair of them anyway—only manages to get out a breathy <em>hi</em> before her hand is gripping the back of Rio's neck and Rio can taste cinnamon on her tongue.</p><p>Maybe they shouldn't be doing this. Maybe Rio should push Agatha away and confess, should be forced to live with the sticky guilt of it. But the way Agatha gasps against them empties their mind of any thought—rational or not—as their mouth finds Agatha's neck, their teeth scrape over her throat and their hands struggle to find a gap between their bodies to unbutton her jeans.</p><p>Rio thinks everyone has been reading their dynamic wrong their entire lives; <em>Agatha Harkness is the most selfish person I know. She'll use you up and leave you with nothing.</em> Rio knows the truth is that they're just as selfish, maybe more so by the way their panicked thoughts start to slow the more of Agatha's breath they take for themself.</p><p>It's all very <em>quick,</em> and they're not stupid enough not to notice they can feel how wet Agatha is even through her underwear.</p><p>Rio pulls away from her neck just enough to pant heavily against the side of Agatha's face, takes their time long enough—a couple of seconds at most—to agitate Agatha, who bites Rio's bottom lip in retaliation, in punishment.</p><p>Rio finds they don't mind so much when it's Agatha doling out the punishments.</p><p>"Touch me," She says, grinds the words between her teeth.</p><p>"You're so wet," Agatha's lips are still against theirs as they speak, "I've barely touched you."</p><p>And maybe the words <em>do</em> come out a little like an accusation though they don't mean them to—just want to know what's in Agatha's mind to have her like this so soon, want to know every detail that pounds through her skull.</p><p>Agatha squirms against them a little, huffs and tightens her grip on the back of Rio's neck, nails digging in a little. Rio finds more pleasure in it than they want to admit right now.</p><p>"What would you say if I told you I'd been touching myself before I came here?"</p><p>Rio can tell Agatha tries to catch them off guard, tries to take control of the direction of the conversation, even as their mouth runs a little dry and their throat makes a weird sort of clicking sound as air tries to pass through. They understand how this side of Agatha works now, though she doesn't seem to realize that. "I'd ask you why you couldn't make yourself come without me."</p><p>Agatha snarls, bucks her hips up against Rio's stilled fingers before her free hand moves Rio's <em>inside</em> her underwear, presses their fingers <em>hard</em> up against her own clit and lets out a sigh, eyes fluttering a little at the touch.</p><p>Rio honestly doesn't want to deny her, doesn't want to deny themself just as much, drags their fingers lower, presses the tips inside Agatha just slightly—finds she parts for them with ease, but all the same says, "Admit it," They lick up the shell of Agatha's ear, catch the way her legs momentarily struggle to hold her, "It's not the same anymore. You <em>need</em> me."</p><p>Before Rio can properly sink deep inside Agatha, there's a knock on their door that they're almost fully committed to ignoring, wants to cover Agatha's mouth with their hand to quiet her so whoever is at their door leaves them alone, but, <em>shit—</em></p><p>Their peripheral vision kicks back in with a blink and their favorite neighbor's face comes into view, has them nearly jumping out of their skin, fingers twitching just barely inside Agatha's cunt before they have time to realize they hadn't closed the fucking door, too caught up in <em>Agatha, Agatha, Agatha—</em></p><p>"This is usually the type of show you have to pay for," Lilia raises an eyebrow, mouth pinched tight. Rio can't tell if she's disgusted or holding back a laugh. "So if you're not charging, you should probably close the door."</p><p>"Ms Calderu—"</p><p>Agatha doesn't give either of them a chance to say anything else, and Rio might be smug if they weren't panicking so much because Agatha holds their wrist still, very plainly doesn't want their hand going anywhere, and slams the door shut with the other.</p><p>"Fuck me." She almost growls against Rio's open mouth.</p><p>And Rio can't really be blamed for not being able to think of a single good reason not to. Not when they have Agatha's voice in their ear whispering things like <em>need you to fill me up,</em> and <em>I've been so empty without your fingers,</em> and definitely not when she moans <em>nothing compares to this with you.</em></p><p>Rio is selfish and takes the words as they want to hear them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>So, Rio doesn't break things off. But that's okay because eventually Agatha will do that for them. She'll get bored of her latest fuck and drop them for someone else, and Rio has until then to learn to be okay with that, to get over her again.</p><p>There must be something in the air alongside the smell of sex as Agatha naps on their chest, sweaty and exhausted, that convinces them they don't need <em>more</em> than what Agatha is willing to offer, that only feeding it, letting it grow insatiable will ruin them.</p><p>They run their fingers up and down Agatha's bare back as the pieces click together maybe a little too easily.</p><p>There's hardly been a time since their friendship with Agatha bloomed that Rio hasn't been in love with her, and for the longest time they've managed to fit that away in a locked box and put it to the back of their mind.</p><p>Agatha has always said she's not a person built for love, that she's hard to get along with, and that she knows she's a difficult person to like.</p><p>Rio has never really had a firm grasp of how true any of those statements could be. Agatha is the person they like the most—easily and unquestionably her friend, and falling in love with her was the simplest decision they never made.</p><p>If there's anyone who can untangle their feelings from reality, it's Rio. They've been doing it for half their life.</p><p>And the rest of it—the sex that Rio should have found most difficult, most embarrassing, is easy too. Agatha is so open, leaves no room for doubt about what she wants. Rio feels their chest flush remembering how she'd asked for them to <em>fuck her until she can't feel her toes,</em> and how Rio had ended up having to move her after—legs like jelly; the muscles in her calves visibly twitching.</p><p>And for every time the little voice of doubt rings out in the back of their mind, says, <em>you're so selfish, Rio Vidal,</em> and <em>this isn't fair to her,</em> they're only reminded of Agatha's own words, <em>I won't regret it,</em> and <em>I want this, </em>and <em>why would I need anyone but you?</em></p><p>In all honesty, this is—has always been all about Agatha. All <em>for</em> Agatha. It is selfish maybe to keep her from every last fact. Less so to give her exactly what she wants—especially when they want the same thing. Especially when Agatha has explicitly told them she couldn't do any of this with anyone but them.</p><p>Maybe this new thing between them will have to end someday, but not today, and not because of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, because they know what Agatha is like, touching her makes Rio feel like they're cradling a bomb in their hands.</p><p>There are times when Agatha gets a bit quiet, a bit contemplative, and Rio thinks, <em>this is it, we had a good run, but it's over now,</em> but Agatha always shakes herself out of it. Usually, these are <em>also</em> the times she brings up something <em>new,</em> something Rio isn't prepared for.</p><p>She looks like that now—chewing on her bottom lip, her head between Rio's thighs after making them come on her tongue. Normally, there's a sort of mad scramble—especially when Agatha has been made to wait for her orgasm, has been told to give Rio one first. This time, she sits back on her toes, bites the remaining taste of Rio from her lips and stares somewhere a little past them.</p><p>"Is everything okay?" Rio says, pushes themself fully up and cups Agatha's cheeks in their palms.</p><p>She blinks out of it, demeanor changing enough for Rio to know that when she says, "Was wondering when you were gonna <em>properly</em> fuck my ass," that it wasn't really all she wanted to say, "I can tell from your increasingly wandering hands that you want to."</p><p>It gives Agatha exactly what she wanted though, Rio imagines. Their mind is flooded with the thought of doing just that and Agatha fucking <em>knows</em> it—her lips curl around a smirk even when her eyes remain the same watery blue.</p><p>Rio's mouth runs dry, "You want it?"</p><p>Agatha runs her palms up Rio's thighs, digs her nails in near their hips and <em>drags</em> them back down again. Rio whimpers, falls back onto their elbows as they hear Agatha's self-satisfied chuckle fill the room as she rises to climb into their lap, "Do I ever ask for things I don't want?"</p><p>Rio doesn't point out that she's asked for Rio, begged for Rio, but still doesn't want them the same way they want her.</p><p>"How am I supposed to give you what you want," They start, hands grasping Agatha's hips and sliding to her ass, grip tightening and spreading her just a little, a tease, "If you don't give me a chance to strap up for you?"</p><p>Rio watches as Agatha's eyes flutter closed and she hums, rolls her hips like there's something there for her to grind into, "It's so cruel that you're not just always ready for me."</p><p>"I <em>am."</em> Rio insists, rolls their hips up into Agatha's, <em>is</em> always ready for her really.</p><p>Agatha starts up a grumble and Rio takes the opening to flip their positions, gets Agatha onto her back, the air pushed from her lungs as she lands.</p><p>"You can wait for me, right?" They say and push themself off Agatha without waiting for a response, since Agatha, given any opportunity, is <em>not</em> good at waiting.</p><p>The lack of opening doesn't seem to matter; Agatha follows them up off the bed, wraps her arms around Rio from behind and mutters in their ear, quiet and almost shy—everything she isn't, "Can I help you?"</p><p>Rio has to hide their smile, "Your benevolence astounds me."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Agatha bites their shoulder, isn't gentle about it. Rio can feel her smile against the marked skin when they let out a yelp, "The sooner we get you ready, the sooner I can have you inside me."</p><p>Rio hums but all the same allows Agatha to slink past them to open the bottom drawer where they keep their steadily growing set of toys. They <em>do</em> have to step in and guide Agatha's wandering, greedy hands away from a strap she'd probably have a hard time taking for the first time, mollifies her by saying, <em>we'll work up to it,</em> and encourages her towards the smallest strap they own.</p><p>"You don't seem confident about the size of your dick today." Agatha sniffs as she tightens the harness around their hips, fits the dark green strap into the o-ring.</p><p>There must be something wrong with Rio to have Agatha try to shame them, and for the only response that comes to mind to fist their hand in her hair and guide her mouth to their cock.</p><p>They've never had her mouth on them like this, didn't know they <em>wanted</em> so badly. Yet more proof that they're not as selfless as perhaps people think.</p><p><em>Oh,</em> and Agatha knows it, one hand wraps around Rio's cock and the other guides their hand to her head, slowly blinks up at them like she can see everything they're thinking.</p><p>"Do you like me like this?"</p><p><em>Like what?</em> Rio could say with a smirk, play it cool and flip the script, make Agatha have to vocalize it.</p><p>But they can be just as needy as Agatha, and their hand tightens its grip, voice gravelly when they say <em>yes</em> and push themself into Agatha's willing mouth.</p><p>Rio learns very quick that Agatha is as greedy with this as she is with everything else—as if encouraging Rio's cock to hit the back of her throat is just as pleasurable for her as when Rio has two fingers rubbing against her clit. Anything she <em>can</em> derive pleasure from, she <em>will</em> derive pleasure from. Rio respects that. <em>Likes</em> that.</p><p>And then, a particularly hard thrust—Rio losing power to their brain until they hear Agatha let out a gargled moan. They're about to pull back, to apologize, but just before they pull out of her mouth entirely, heart beating a little faster now, they catch how her hand has drifted down between her own thighs like Rio had <em>meant</em> to do that.</p><p>Her eyes flutter open at Rio's lack of movement, hand stilling between her legs like she can see on Rio's face that something isn't right. Rio has just about enough awareness to believe nothing else could be this right. Agatha's lips are pouty, just around the tip of Rio's cock, and Rio can't help themself, pushes in until they can just barely feel the base of the strap pressing against their clit.</p><p>"Good girl. So pretty," Rio mumbles more to themself than Agatha, but she sags against them anyway at the words, eyes drooping back closed as she gags a little from how deep Rio is. But they don't pull back this time.</p><p>They're not even sure who is in control at this point. Agatha, on her knees for them <em>shouldn't</em> be the one in control, and Rio feels <em>powerful,</em> sure, but this is all what Agatha wanted.</p><p>Rio should really get her to stop touching herself, reassert themself, but they swear they can <em>smell</em> her, how much she wants them, how wet sucking Rio's cock has gotten her.</p><p>They know they've missed their chance though, when Agatha's nose brushes up against them, right hand coming to support herself against Rio's thigh as she chokes through her own orgasm.</p><p>She looks far too pleased with herself when she pulls back, spit on her chin and her throat.</p><p>"You just can't help yourself, can you?" Rio swipes their thumb across her lip, wets it in Agatha's spit and pushes it inside her mouth. She blinks up at Rio like she couldn't possibly know what they mean.</p><p>"I'm just getting you ready," Agatha complains, brings her other hand to Rio's hip in what seems to be a soothing kind of motion, but she just smears her own come on their skin, and that doesn't help at all, "You weren't planning on going in dry, were you?"</p><p>Rio's body heats up with how easily Agatha can bait them, <em>"No—"</em> They splutter, pull Agatha to her feet and watch how even biting her lip can't hold back her smile, her eyes twinkling along, "You <em>know</em> I have lube."</p><p>Agatha lets out something close to a <em>giggle,</em> but before Rio can even think to make fun of her for it, she licks along their jaw and ends it in a bite to their earlobe. She's a little harder to tame untied. A <em>lot</em> harder.</p><p>But then she breathes in—shakier than before and not, Rio thinks, because she's trying to recover her breath. She maintains her sly grin but uncertainty creeps onto her face as she says, through gritted teeth like the words themselves are forcing their way out of her mouth, unbidden, "I've never done this before."</p><p>Rio wets their lips, takes a moment to figure out how to respond because they <em>know</em> Agatha has never done this, if they're to fill in the gaps from when they used a plug on her that one time and she'd never done that with another person either.</p><p>She's nervous, Rio realizes, heart clenching.</p><p>"I know, sweetheart," Rio can't help but slip into it, can't bring themself to stop calling Agatha these things—not when it makes her relax into their hands like hearing them is the only thing she's ever going to need, "We'll take things nice and slow, like we always do with something new."</p><p>The forced smile drops from Agatha's face as she softens and nods, just needed to know Rio would take care of her. And they always, <em>always</em> would. Then, like she's nervous about that as well—Rio seeing and understanding how she really feels, Agatha wraps a hand around Rio's cock, still slick with her spit, and pulls them to the bed.</p><p>"Not <em>too</em> slow, I hope," She lets go of them to lie herself back on the sheets, "I want you to fucking <em>ruin</em> me, Rio."</p><p>Rio gets their hands on her hips, grips tight and enjoys the gasping breath Agatha probably pretends didn't let slip from her lips, "Turn over for me," They say, ignoring her attempt at riling them up for now, "I want to see you."</p><p>Agatha's need and her greed must greatly outweigh any anxiety she has about the whole thing because she rolls over with barely a second to <em>think</em> about what Rio has asked of her, arches her back for them and fists her hands into the sheets in front of her.</p><p><em>Perfect,</em> they think, might say aloud if the shiver that runs down Agatha's spine is any indication. They shake their head. Stupid.</p><p>"You don't think I can fuck you <em>nice,</em> and <em>deep,</em> and <em>slow,"</em> Rio starts, brings their fingers to Agatha's inner thigh, drags them up through the wetness she's left there, up to her cunt, doesn't waste time before pushing two inside her, "And ruin you at the same time?"</p><p>Agatha gasps their name and clenches around their fingers and that's all the confirmation Rio really needs, leans over her back with a smirk they brush against her skin.</p><p>Agatha doesn't seem to remember how to form any other words, stutters out their name again when they curl their fingers and then start up what they know to be a torturously slow pace.</p><p>As much as Rio likes possessing the ability to render Agatha speechless, they reach between her legs with their other hand to pinch her clit, "I asked you a question."</p><p><em>"I—"</em> Agatha sort of squeaks, trembling under Rio's touch already.</p><p>"Is that too difficult, baby?" Rio says, stretches Agatha with another finger, "Should I ask a different question?"</p><p><em>("I like the dirty talk," Agatha says in the aftermath. She's sitting on the edge of the bath and hugging a knee to her chest as Rio fills the tub. She didn't want to be alone, she'd said. "I was surprised at first."</em></p><p><em>Rio, who sometimes cringes when suddenly, as they're driving, or trying to fall asleep, or talking to a customer, they remember all the embarrassing things they'd said to Agatha in the heat of the moment, feels the anxiety over it lessen in their chest, even as they flush hot.</em></p><p><em>"Surprised how much you like it?" They start, eyes flicker over to Agatha and then quickly back to the tub. It's silly to be embarrassed, really, when not even an hour ago they had Agatha on her back, bent nearly in half as they pushed her over into her fifth orgasm of the night, "Or surprised that it's me saying those things?"</em></p><p><em>"It's cute how you can barely talk about it now when you literally came when I called myself a slut for you just before," Rio does </em>not<em> meet Agatha's eyes when she shifts along the edge of the bath and closer to them, "Which </em>you<em> encouraged, by the way."</em></p><p><em>"W-well—"</em></p><p><em>"Both, Rio," She leans in and bites their side—right next to a fading hickey. Agatha is a biter, Rio is learning, "Makes me feel fucking filthy hearing you say what you're gonna do to me, the way you make me say it too."</em></p><p><em>Rio opens their mouth to speak, but Agatha gets there first with an accompanying eye roll, </em>"Yes, <em>in a good way."</em></p><p><em>When Agatha had first brought up her degradation kink, Rio's first and only thought definitely hadn't been with the dynamic of it </em>this<em> way round.</em></p><p><em>"Oh," Rio says, just to have something to respond with as they turn the taps off.</em></p><p><em>Agatha pushes them out of the way as soon as she hears the water stop running, only held back by Rio's fingers quickly wrapping around her ankle so they can check the temperature first. She doesn't say anything more until she's got Rio settled in behind her and she's wiggled against their front a few times to find the comfiest position.</em></p><p><em>"Stop overthinking it," Agatha says, reaches up and wraps a wet hand around the back of Rio's neck to bring their face next to hers, smushes them together. She flutters her eyelashes and Rio shivers when they feel it against their cheek, "I'm kinda worryingly into you being a bit of a dick to me."</em></p><p><em>Well then.)</em></p><p>"Would you like my fingers somewhere else, baby?"</p><p>Agatha's resulting moan is loud even with her face pressed down in the bed, and Rio can't help but tease her, pulls their fingers out until just the tips are inside her. She lets out a mournful sort of sound as she rocks back to greedily take Rio's fingers in deeper again. Rio doesn't think there's much harm in letting her today.</p><p>"So desperate for it and this isn't even how you want to be fucked."</p><p>Agatha shifts her face to cast what is maybe meant to be a glare over her shoulder, but with her eyes glassy and a little unfocused it mostly just comes off as a sort of plea.</p><p>Even if Agatha doesn't want them in the same way, it's an ego filled, potent rush to know Agatha has asked, <em>is</em> asking currently with teary eyes alone, for them to take her in a way no one else ever has before; has never trusted anyone but Rio with her body like this.</p><p>Though Agatha would probably never admit to it, she starts getting a little predictable when she's desperate, and it won't be long, Rio thinks, before she <em>begs</em> for them with words, spreads herself open for them. They like knowing this about her, feel the swell of pride knowing she <em>wants</em> them this much.</p><p><em>"Rio, please."</em></p><p>"Come on," Rio stays motionless as Agatha fucks herself back on their fingers, "Tell me."</p><p>Agatha takes in a gulp of air, drowning under Rio's words—very much obvious now that the control has fallen back into Rio's hand. Her voice shakes, "Need you to fuck me."</p><p>"I <em>am</em> fucking you." Rio sort of has to hold back a laugh at the almost roar of frustration Agatha lets out into the sheets.</p><p>She flails a hand back to grab at Rio, doesn't quite get the angle she wants and shoves her hand between her thighs instead, and, in the most shocking move of the night so far, wraps her fingers around Rio's wrist to slowly pull their fingers out.</p><p><em>"Rio, I can't—."</em> She says in a quiet voice and they can't help but take pity on her.</p><p>"It's alright, angel," They notice the way Agatha relaxes at the sound of the lube being opened, "I've got you."</p><p>They've done this once before but even still, Rio feels their heart start to pound in their chest when they press a lubed finger to Agatha's ass. They think giving her a little might be all the encouragement she needs to let go of the last of her anxieties over this.</p><p>"Can you do me a favor?" Rio says, spare hand resting on Agatha's back as they work their finger in just the tiniest bit, only to pull back again to see their vision out in full.</p><p>"I'm a <em>little</em> preoccupied," Agatha's voice sounds rough—a testament to just how much she wants this because Rio hasn't exactly done a lot. She must want it so badly that she realizes how she sounds because then she clears her throat before Rio can say anything more, and says, "I can try. For you."</p><p>Rio can only be glad Agatha isn't looking at them because an embarrassing shiver zips down their spine. "Can you spread yourself for me?" They say before they can think any more of it.</p><p>It's like she'd only been waiting for Rio to ask, like she'd wanted it this whole time but didn't want Rio to know how eager she is. Which is a little silly when Agatha's body visibly craves pleasure every time they're together.</p><p>Rio has never come untouched before, but gets worryingly woozy when Agatha spreads herself open for them, when they have unfiltered access to how ready she looks. They have to steady themself with a hand on Agatha's back when they see her clenching in anticipation because <em>whoa.</em></p><p>When they stop being such a fucking loser, their vision no longer clouded, they lube up their fingers again—can never be too careful—and press back into Agatha's ass. They work slow, noting the way Agatha calms at finally being given what she wants, only adding a second finger when they see her grow a little restless again. Rio's chest heaves when they feel how tight she is around them.</p><p>Somehow, the wet sounds of Rio fucking their fingers into Agatha are a lot dirtier when it's her ass. Perhaps because Agatha is quieter—focused, it seems, on feeling Rio like this. She was quieter the first time too. Maybe the connection from brain to mouth gets nudged loose with just a few fingers up her ass.</p><p><em>"Need it,"</em> Comes Agatha's voice, just when Rio is beginning to think they might never hear it again—and what a tragedy that would be, <em>"I-I—Rio—"</em></p><p>"You ready for it?" They slowly pull their fingers out, listen to Agatha's conflicting whine and reach for the lube again, probably using <em>way</em> too much on their strap but they're not about to hurt Agatha with stupidity and impatience.</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> Agatha hisses, hands rearranging her grip on her ass like she's slipping with sweaty palms, like she wants to make sure Rio can <em>see</em> how ready she is, "Need you inside me."</p><p>"In here?" Rio says, teases Agatha with a light press of their hips forward, nudges the tip of their strap against her, "<em>Dirty girl.</em> You'd let me do anything to you."</p><p><em>"Anything,"</em> Agatha gasps out immediately, moans <em>deep,</em> "For you. <em>All</em> for—"</p><p>Her words get cut off when Rio starts to push inside her, watches how she stretches to accommodate, barely taking air into their lungs.</p><p>It takes a couple of minutes of Rio working their hips, watching for the slightest change in Agatha's body, to get most of the length inside of her. Agatha could probably take it quicker, but they're being extra careful with her, and she doesn't ask for more. Rio swallows, mouth tacky when they finally allow themself a <em>proper</em> look at Agatha tightening around them.</p><p>"Feel good, baby?"</p><p>They can hear Agatha's breath hitch before she moans more than says, <em>"Good,</em> feels good," And then, just in case Rio didn't get it, she pushes back onto them just a little bit—just enough that she takes the last inch, gets Rio's hips pressed against her ass, whines like she hadn't been expecting <em>more,</em> and says, <em>"Green,</em> I'm so fucking green, baby."</p><p>So Rio pulls out—slow so Agatha can get used to it, doesn't want to hurt her, watches for any sign that she's uncomfortable. And when their hips meet Agatha's ass again—their only buffer Agatha's own hands still set on spreading herself open, they give her another moment, hand coming down to rest on her spine—a comfort, they hope.</p><p>"Agatha?" She's just so unusually quiet that Rio <em>has</em> to know she's okay, that she's still green, needs to remind Agatha that they're here and she can change her mind if—</p><p><em>"I thought,</em>" Agatha's voice comes out strained and Rio can hear her wetting her mouth to try again, "I thought I told you to ruin me."</p><p>Rio doesn't want to hold back from giving her what she so clearly wants anymore, pulls back before moving their hands to Agatha's hips for a better grip for when they push back in, add a snap to their hips that seems to dislodge Agatha from her concentration entirely, and Rio gets to watch in real time, how she sinks down into <em>feeling</em> alone rather than thinking or worrying about her reactions to it.</p><p>It doesn't take long then for Agatha's hands to slip away from the hold she had, has to reach out for the sheets in front of her once more with the faster pace Rio sets.</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> Rio swears they can almost <em>feel</em> Agatha around them, can feel how fucking tight she is, struggles to keep that out of their head; doesn't want to do something as embarrassing as <em>coming</em> just a few minutes into this. This is for Agatha, it's all for Agatha—they're just along for the ride.</p><p>And, <em>god,</em> now they're thinking about that, they quite literally have to shake the thought of it from their mind—Agatha riding them like they had that time they fucked her with the plug in, but this time buried deep in her ass. Maybe the angle would be good for them to fit a few fingers inside her cunt too. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck,</em> it <em>really</em> isn't the time.</p><p>It's Agatha that breaks them out of their thoughts with a guttural moan, punctuated by Rio's now harsher thrusts—lost entirely to pleasure now. Rio bends over her back a little and their lips twitch up, pleased, "There's my good girl," Agatha's responding moan sticks to them—greek fire that Rio was made to burn in. They can see her knuckles whitening from her grip, can see the tear that leaks from her eye and tracks over the bridge of her nose, "That's it, let me hear you, sweetheart."</p><p>Agatha takes their words to heart, the last pin of restraint finally pulled, <em>"Rio—"</em> She gasps, mouthing at her own arm like she needs something there, <em>"Feels so good, Rio."</em></p><p>"Yeah?" Rio leans further over her, one hand taking their weight while the other jerkily moves to Agatha's face, thumb brushing over her lips and smiling when she doesn't even think about taking it into her mouth, "As good as you thought?"</p><p><em>"Yeah—"</em> Agatha agrees, tip of Rio's thumb still between soft lips, "Love how you fuck me."</p><p>"How many times have you thought about me taking you like this?" Rio grins when Agatha just gets louder, "You love teasing me about it, don't you? But I see you, Agatha," Their thrusts slow a little—mostly to get their words out, but Agatha doesn't need to know that, "I bet you go home and think about it every time you bring it up, just fucking <em>desperate</em> for me to fuck your ass the way you've been wanting."</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em></p><p>"Go ahead," Rio pulls their thumb from Agatha's lips, slides their hand down over her tits, her belly, gives a little self indulgent tug to her bush, just to hear her whimper, "Tell me you don't love being stretched out around my cock." And then they press their fingers to her clit—any sort of response dying on Agatha's tongue as she near sobs.</p><p>Agatha doesn't end up getting any words out—not that Rio really minds when she's louder than she ever has been before. And Agatha doesn't hold herself back. She doesn't get embarrassed at vocalizing her pleasure the way Rio does, <em>definitely</em> doesn't care about Rio's neighbors, but this is different; it sounds like a <em>relief.</em></p><p>"Fuck, baby," Rio gasps when Agatha just about screams through her orgasm. They've never heard that sound leave her before and <em>god,</em> they want to hear it again, "That's it, you just take it, sweetheart."</p><p>Like her orgasm broke the seal over her mind, Agatha <em>stays</em> just as loud as Rio builds her up to another, mutters about how good she sounds, how pretty she looks, how they can't wait to fuck her with a bigger strap, stretch her out the way she likes.</p><p>And it's not that Rio <em>wants</em> to keep her quiet but there's an itch in their brain when they hear themself say, "Do I need to fucking gag you?"</p><p>Agatha moans something that vaguely sounds like an agreement<em>,</em> and then, just in case they didn't get it, commits herself to using her vocal chords the way they were intended, and <em>shit,</em> she sounds so fucking wrecked, <em>"Please—please, do it, please, Rio, god, fuck—"</em></p><p>Rio swallows hard. They don't own a gag, hadn't even thought about it before in a way that was appealing. The appeal, they think, is whatever Agatha wants to try, whatever she thinks she might like. The thought that they might be able to tap into her brain, share thoughts for a moment and see Agatha how she's picturing herself in this moment—bent over and fucking <em>drooling</em> around the gag in her mouth as Rio fucks her ass.</p><p>Yeah, maybe they get it now.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Hours later, Agatha is wrapped in a huge fluffy blanket, laying on her side in the middle of Rio's bed, fully cocooned except for the arm sticking out through a tiny gap so she can scroll on Rio's laptop.</p><p>They like to be <em>certain</em> Agatha is okay to be without them while they clean everything, won't even think about leaving if Agatha can't take her eyes off them, her hands off them. <em>Makes her feel grounded,</em> she'd said.</p><p>It's Rio's laptop that has her full attention now, after being properly spoiled. If this were the other way around, and Agatha had got on the bed behind them, spooned them, and peered over at their screen, Rio would have slammed the laptop closed and not spoken to Agatha for about a week out of sheer embarrassment.</p><p>Since it's <em>this</em> way round, when Rio peers over Agatha's body to see her shopping with two tabs open, side by side—the left side showing a page full of ball gags, and the other side, a paddle that takes them a second to work out says <em>slut,</em> they simply feel their body set itself on fire and choke on their own tongue instead.</p><p>"Subtle," Agatha says, doesn't even bother shifting to look at Rio, "What do you think?"</p><p>"Um—" Is the only thing that manages to leave Rio's mouth.</p><p>"After you were <em>so</em> vocal earlier too." They can hear the amusement in Agatha's voice.</p><p>Rio reaches over to vaguely point to the left side of the screen, "You, um, you want that?"</p><p>"It wasn't obvious when I came pretty much right after you made me think about it?" She casts a glance behind her, leaves Rio blinking at her like a deer in headlights.</p><p>"And the um—other thing," Rio can feel themself blushing, only blushes harder when Agatha's eyes dart to their cheeks and she grins, "I think I might have to hit you pretty hard with that to make it show."</p><p>Agatha's eyes snap back to Rio's and she runs her tongue over her bottom lip, eyes a little unfocused like she's thinking about it, "I'm not hearing any negatives," She says and promptly adds both items to the basket.</p><p>This woman is going to be the death of them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn't seen Agatha in nearly a week. It's the longest they've gone without seeing each other since they started having sex, and they're honestly starting to get a little worried. Rio has a hard time remembering <em>any</em> time they went a week without seeing each other. They've always been teased for being attached at the hip.</p><p>They've let Agatha set the pace with this whole thing, thinking maybe she'd need the night to get over the embarrassment that Rio isn't used to seeing from her, but that was plainly written across every line of her body. But Agatha didn't text them that night, and not the next morning. She sent them a picture of a dog when she was out getting coffee on the second morning, but there's been nothing about wanting to <em>see</em> Rio again.</p><p>Rio is used to Agatha dropping pre-discussed kinks at random when they fuck. After she found out they were interested in being choked, she didn't wait too long to wrap her fingers loose around their throat and ask for their color—a first, small dip into Agatha taking control for the first time. She'd asked about the likelihood of them having a praise kink <em>('I've always thought you might enjoy being told you're doing a good job')</em> before she got them down on their knees and said, <em>"Make me come like a good boy, Rio,"</em> and so they <em>were</em> a little shocked when Agatha dropped her breeding kink out of nowhere.</p><p>It's not something they'd ever thought about, not a kink they really knew much about, but that's not to say Rio isn't interested. The way their brain turned off, instinct taking over to press their hips firm against Agatha's, hand still fisted in her hair, Agatha's begging sending them hurtling into an orgasm that had hardly had time to build.</p><p>But then, after they were done, and Rio was about to maneuver them both onto the sofa, massage the feeling back into Agatha's body, get rid of the tightness in her hips, her back from being bent over the arm of the sofa for so long, was about to tell her, giddy and flushed that she's unlocked something in them, Agatha pulled away. She could barely even look Rio in the eye, shied away from their touch like she never had before.</p><p><em>("Did I do something wrong?"</em></p><p><em>"I shouldn't have said that."</em></p><p><em>"Said—"</em></p><p><em>"I should go.")</em></p><p>The memory of it keeps twisting further and further up in Rio's stomach and there's really only one explanation for it. They've tried to make it make sense with countless reasons, but the way Agatha couldn't even look at them, couldn't play it off with a laugh, <em>"I don't want you to get me pregnant or anything, but it's hot, right?"</em></p><p>Agatha wasn't thinking about Rio when she asked. She went somewhere deep in her mind where the person fucking her wasn't Rio, only aided by the fact that she was getting fucked from behind, couldn't see them.</p><p>They just thought they'd have a little longer than a month of this, thought she wouldn't grow tired of them this quickly and look elsewhere. Any time they're tempted to try and work out who it might be, they have to distract themself. Agatha is allowed to break things off at any time, is <em>allowed</em> to have sex with someone else tomorrow if she wanted, and Rio shouldn't feel like this is a betrayal just because Agatha is the only one doing <em>friends with benefits</em> properly.</p><p>This whole thing is just dredging up how in love Rio is again, and they've done so well to keep that restrained, to separate their attraction to Agatha from their feelings.</p><p>Because if they've learned anything from Agatha's unwillingness to hold back, her openness about sex—so different from how Rio has always been, her lack of shame about <em>wanting</em> Rio, it's that they're <em>allowed</em> to be attracted to Agatha.</p><p>If Agatha—and this is a real possibility—wants to keep having sex with Rio, then they want her to feel like she can fantasize about other things, other people, even if it hurts a little, just to make it better for her. It's not her fault Rio fell in love with her.</p><p>But if Agatha doesn't want them anymore in any regard, then that's okay—they'll learn to be okay with th—</p><p>"Large veg pizza, no mushrooms, for Rio?"</p><p>Rio blinks back into consciousness at the sound of their name. Had forgotten they were having this realization in Agatha's favorite pizza place. Their body takes a moment too long to catch up and they drop their money all over the fucking floor like an idiot.</p><p>"Just, uh—" Rio stumbles and almost drops the pizza too and then just backs away to the door, eyes fixed resolutely to the floor, "Keep the change."</p><p>Agatha might have to get it delivered from now on.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio replays the night over and over in their mind, staring up at the ceiling and breathing in time with Agatha's almost snores.</p><p><em>"You don't have to look at me if you wanna picture someone else."</em></p><p>They needed her to know it was okay, but then—</p><p><em>"I don't,"</em> Agatha had said, voice small but sure, <em>"I don't wanna picture someone else."</em></p><p>Rio had come over tonight half expecting to have Agatha tell them it isn't working anymore; the other half thinking they might have sex again—Agatha reminding them of what they're supposed to be, that this is just a physical relationship alone, and that anything she feels for them is platonic, but—</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>Maybe Agatha <em>isn't</em> going to break things off with them.</p><p>Before they can think too hard about it, Agatha rolls over with a whimper, eyebrows creased and a small frown on her face, reaches for Rio.</p><p>They take her cold hand in theirs, bring it up to their lips to brush a kiss to her fingers before letting their joined hands rest on top of their stomach, pulling the covers further up with their other hand.</p><p>Agatha's face smooths out, peaceful, and Rio feels their chest settle just seeing her. They fall asleep within minutes.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It takes Rio another month to realize Agatha is in love with them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It's maybe a good thing Rio's instinct generally isn't to react with violence to the unknown. Much more likely for their body to shut down, to get away and hide, and then, if needed, respond with <em>carefully planned</em> violence later on.</p><p>(Eg. <em>The Case of Ralph Bohner's Broken Nose</em> in 2012.)</p><p>When an arm is looped through their own on their way to grab their morning coffee—a treat for it being Saturday, they honestly nearly make a run for it before they look and see Jen's face smiling back at them.</p><p>"What the fuck?" Rio splutters, shoves their headphones down around their neck.</p><p>"I've been calling your name."</p><p>"I—" Rio doesn't know what to say, just gestures to their headphones, heart still fucking <em>pounding.</em></p><p>Jen doesn't seem to care that she was almost the reason for Rio not making it past twenty nine, "I thought we could spend the morning together."</p><p>"Um," Rio hesitates but lets Jen keep her arm linked in theirs, "Why?"</p><p>"Just wanted to hang out!" Jen says, scarily smiley, "Is that a crime?"</p><p>It might be, the way Jen does it.</p><p><em>"No,"</em> Rio says, though even <em>they</em> can hear the uncertainty in their voice, leads Jen to the door of their regular coffee shop anyway, "Just—we don't hang out that much. Alone."</p><p>Rio doesn't even need a single hand to count how many times. They're friends with Jen, sure. They see her all the time, she surprisingly gets their weird sense of humor, but that's when they're all in a group. They're not the type of friends who go out by themselves.</p><p>"Well, maybe I wanted to change that," Jen shrugs and finally unlinks their arms to find a table, "Be a dear and order me a latte?"</p><p>They just nod. That was fucking weird.</p><p>It's like everything in the universe is working against them because <em>why</em> is the line so short on a Saturday? It's never like this.</p><p>They half think Jen's paid off the regulars.</p><p>There's a beat of awkward silence when Rio sits back down, Jen's face pulled tight into a smile like it's killing her to keep it there.</p><p>"So what's this really about?"</p><p>Rio watches as Jen's face drops into something resembling her normal one, "Listen, I—"</p><p>Jen isn't a hesitant person, but she cringes when Rio squeaks out, "What?"</p><p>She sighs, "What's going on with you and Agatha?"</p><p>That's all it takes for Rio's heart to drop into the pit of their stomach, "Right," They swallow and try to act normal, "Why do you think something's going on?"</p><p><em>"Is</em> there?" The look on Jen's face tells them not to bother lying.</p><p>Rio's mouth opens and closes, though no words come out. Like a fish. How <em>Jen</em> knows they're having sex, they have no idea.</p><p>"Agatha was being weird when I saw her too," Jen says, taps her nails against her latte glass. And just when Rio thinks she's about to tell them they need to stop, that it's going to ruin their friendship and take them all with it, she says, "Did you tell her?"</p><p>Rio's brain stutters, "Tell her what?"</p><p>Jen is good enough to cast a glance around like she's worried Agatha might materialize at the table next to them, "That you're <em>painfully,</em> obviously in love with her."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>She really could've left the '<em>painful'</em> part out.</p><p>Jen blinks when they don't give her any more than that, hands flailing a little like she might be able to grasp Rio's unspoken words from the air, "What did she say?"</p><p>"Jen, I," Rio pictures it for a moment, really, <em>really</em> ruining their friendship, "I didn't tell her."</p><p>They don't bother asking how she knows. They don't bother trying to lie about it.</p><p>It's Jen's turn to say, "Oh."</p><p>Rio tries to keep their face neutral, their voice casual, "There's nothing going on. You must've just caught her at a bad time."</p><p>"Is there ever a <em>good</em> time to catch Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha is rarely in a bad mood when Rio sees her. Best friend privileges, they suppose. Rio just shrugs.</p><p>Jen scoffs like this makes sense, and she says, more to herself than to Rio, "Yeah, of course she's different with you."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>Jen squints at them, lips pursing like she's considering her options—just for a moment, but then it passes.</p><p>Rio wonders how long Jen's known Agatha is in love with them.</p><p>Longer than a day, that's for sure. And now they <em>really</em> feel stupid for not seeing it before. Especially because Agatha has sort of been open and honest about it from the very beginning, has told Rio to their face that she loves them, had chosen to do that after sex.</p><p>"Are you <em>going</em> to tell her?" Jen huffs like Rio's wasting her time, "Because it's her birthday this week and she's aging like fine wine even though she <em>refuses</em> to use any of the skincare I keep recommending her—do <em>not</em> tell her I said that."</p><p>Rio can only laugh, "No."</p><p><em>"No?"</em> Jen splutters, looks at Rio like they're insane, "Rio, she's not gonna be single forever, I mean, if you can get past the personality—"</p><p>"Yes, she is," Rio's smile twitches when they're forced to remember the second, more devastating truth—that even though Agatha is in love with them, "Agatha doesn't date."</p><p>Jen slumps back in her chair like this conversation is shaving years off her life, "She doesn't date people who aren't <em>you."</em></p><p>But if Agatha wanted them, they've been right here for her this whole time, asking her on dates she didn't want to go on, asking her to be exclusive only to find out that doesn't mean the same thing to Agatha as it does to them.</p><p>Agatha may like fucking them, Agatha may be in love with them. But Agatha doesn't want to date them.</p><p>"If I'm so painfully obvious about being in love with her, why doesn't <em>she</em> ask <em>me</em> out?"</p><p>"You're the butch, that's your job." Jen's face says this should be obvious. <em>Duh.</em> "And anyway, it's obvious to <em>us,"</em> Rio doesn't like the implication that the rest of their friends sit around gossiping about their love life, "But I think Agatha's fucking clueless."</p><p>Rio's coffee is mostly cold, but they drink it anyway to buy themself more time.</p><p>"I think you should tell her," Jen says, and she reaches across the table to rest a hand on top of Rio's to get her point across. Rio only feels a little weird about it. "You <em>need</em> to tell her."</p><p>Part of Rio—at least eighty percent of them—sort of wants to shove the idea far away and never touch it again. The other part is sort of convinced Jen is right.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sex with Agatha isn't usually gentle.</p><p>Rio had thought, the night before her birthday, this would be no different—that she'd be demanding, controlling, would push herself to take as many orgasms as her body could handle as some sort of gift to herself.</p><p>But for Rio, who had built themself up all night to confess to Agatha, they don't mind too much, glad that Agatha is in her right mind, doesn't want her answer to be influenced by her floaty subspace that makes her a little more pliable than usual.</p><p>Rio wonders how long Agatha has been in love with them for, if it's always been as noticeable as it is now.</p><p>"You <em>do</em> make me laugh," She's saying, hands wrapped around Rio's neck and holding them close, strap deep inside her, "You make me happy."</p><p>Rio's eyes flutter closed as they try to steady their breathing. They sort of wonder if maybe Agatha hopes they can make her happy for the rest of her life. They say, voice quiet, trying to step softly into a confession, "I don't know what I'd do without you."</p><p>They feel sick with nerves, worried that they might have gotten this all wrong, and they didn't picture doing this while inside her, but there's something about the intimacy of it all, just them holding each other as close as possible that has them gasping for her attention.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha only lifts her chin from Rio's shoulder to push herself up, sinks back down onto them like she hadn't realized they weren't simply moaning her name, <em>"Please."</em></p><p>"Agatha, I need to tell—"</p><p>Agatha's hand slaps over their mouth, eyes wide like Rio is fucking crazy, and the confession dies inside their mouth.</p><p>Rio has made a lot of embarrassing mistakes in their life, but they don't have many regrets. This is one of them.</p><p>"Please don't ruin this," She's begging with words and wide eyes, hand sliding from Rio's mouth to cup their face—a move that makes Rio want to sob, "Not now."</p><p>They do their best to shake the feeling away, hardening against their feelings. None of this is Agatha's fault, and for as much as she'd like to deny it, Agatha is always careful with them. Like one is with a baby bird. Trying to stop them from getting hurt.</p><p>"What do you want?" They ask, throat thick with unshed tears.</p><p>"I don't want to remember my own name by the time you're done with me."</p><p>And Rio has always liked Agatha's honesty, but just this once, selfishly, they wish she'd just lie and say, <em>"You. I just want you."</em></p>

<p><em>"How do you know when it's over?"</em></p><p><em>Rio's voice is soft and gentle and laps against Agatha's skin. She's just in that glowing feeling of the comedown from sex—not quite back in her own body yet, and more floating somewhere above it.</em></p><p><em>The 'after' part of sex has always been the worst. An awkward conversation, her fingers twitching in the direction of her discarded clothes, and her beating heart the timer for when is appropriate to peel back the covers and retreat back to her own home—much too big and much too empty for just one person.</em></p><p><em>Agatha likes sex. Loves sex. Hates one night stands. Hates when they're </em>needy.<em> No one </em>needs<em> Agatha.</em></p><p><em>Finding someone interested in having no strings attached sex when kink is involved—even just for a couple of months—is much more Agatha's thing.</em></p><p><em>Her brain isn't screaming at her to find an exit when she's untying her partner, when she's checking that their skin is unharmed except in ways that were discussed, when she's making sure they both replenish their fluids, and making sure they're okay to be left alone.</em></p><p><em>Agatha doesn't </em>hate<em> structure, finds she needs it sometimes. It's a comfort to know there are steps she has to follow—not just for her partner's safety, but her own as well. Dom drop is a fucking bitch.</em></p><p><em>The 'after' part of sex with Rio doesn't feel like that. She feels like she's in a room that </em>glows<em> even when the sun is past setting, feels like even her worst qualities have been gently taken from her clawing hands along with her most redeeming ones, and gently kissed by soft lips—cared for until she's ready to take them back.</em></p><p><em>How do you know when it's over?</em></p><p><em>Agatha stretches as she considers Rio's words, feels their grip tighten on the swell of her stomach like she was contemplating moving out of their range. She wasn't. She likes the feeling of them around her too much. She does turn a little so she's mostly on her back though—no longer being spooned by them. Their hand still rests on her stomach.</em></p><p><em>"When what's over?"</em></p><p><em>But Rio seems to have moved on, "You're like a cat when you do that."</em></p><p><em>Agatha's eyes narrow even though it's her own ceiling that receives her wrath. "A cat?"</em></p><p><em>"Yeah," Rio says like Agatha gets it, like this is perfectly reasonable, "Kinda like you've found a patch of sun you don't want to leave, but you still wanna roll over for me to pet your belly."</em></p><p><em>Agatha doesn't give them the satisfaction of a response.</em></p><p><em>"When </em>what<em> is over?" She repeats.</em></p><p><em>"The sex," Rio says, blushes like they weren't inside Agatha just five minutes ago, "As a whole, I mean. I know when sex is over." It's probably too late and she's probably in too deep to be put off by Rio's social ineptitude. As it is, Agatha is only mostly endeared. "When you're doing this with other people, when do you think is the right time to end things?"</em></p><p><em>Doing this with other people. Agatha doesn't think she's ever quite done </em>this<em> with other people.</em></p><p><em>Agatha sighs, "When it starts not feeling good, I guess." She's never had to think too deeply about ending things with someone else, "I don't like when it goes on for too long and someone I don't know anything about other than their name and what they like in bed starts acting like they have some kind of claim to me. I like to end it before any of that. Before there has to be some sort of fight about it."</em></p><p><em>"Agatha Harkness </em>not<em> wanting a fight?" Rio teases a smirk into her shoulder, "The world must be ending."</em></p><p><em>"If this is your idea of pillow talk, no wonder you can't hold down a relationship."</em></p><p><em>The hand on Agatha's stomach releases its grip. Agatha's heart pounds harshly in her chest just once, wants to take the words back, but then Rio's fingers start a teasing glide up to her sternum, "Does it look like I'm concerned about that right now?"</em></p><p><em>Agatha doesn't even get her 'no' out before she's pulling Rio into a kiss. It's too early to be thinking about the end. All </em>she's<em> concerned about is the way Rio doesn't seem even slightly interested in the idea of someone else.</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Going off her own logic, Agatha should have ended things with Rio <em>weeks</em> ago, back when she first had the thought that sleeping in the same bed nearly every night isn't super-duper casual. She's never been happy to wake up to someone else in her bed, or to wake to find she was so bone tired she'd completely missed her window for escape in the middle of the night.</p><p>Agatha has irresponsibly become accustomed to waking up with Rio's body wrapped around her own and holding her close.</p><p>But after last night, though her heart cracks to reach for the empty space in her bed, she can't say she's surprised.</p><p>Fuck, she didn't think Rio would just <em>leave.</em></p><p>Agatha rolls onto her back and hooks her thumbs just under the ridge of her brow, practically shoved into her eye sockets, digs them harshly in to try to stop the tears. It's a stupid thing to cry over, really.</p><p>She just has to get on with her day, her life, like this doesn't change anything. Rio is her best friend; that didn't change because they started <em>fucking.</em></p><p>And maybe she <em>is</em> her mother's daughter because she she thinks ignoring the issue might mean she'll eventually be rid of it, that she won't feel this way forever. A tried and tested theory passed down through generations of Harkness women, Agatha supposes. It worked for her own mother finally being rid of <em>her.</em></p><p>The worst thing of all is that she's come to think of Rio's apartment, Rio's <em>bed</em> as her own as well—so intrinsically linked that—</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha bolts up, hastily wipes a lone tear hell-bent on embarrassing her from her cheekbone.</p><p>This is Rio's apartment.</p><p>It would be a pretty stupid move to invite her over if they were planning to break up with her, couldn't give themself the exit.</p><p>And even though she's worked all of that out, she still fucking jumps when the bedroom door is bumped open and she sees two cups filled to the brim with coffee that Rio—body and face appearing moments later—is focused on not spilling.</p><p>A soft smile spreads over their face when they make it over the threshold and stop wide eyed staring at the mugs, and instead meet Agatha's eyes.</p><p>She's very glad only one tear managed to escape.</p><p>Agatha tries not to think about losing mornings like this—Rio in nothing but a loose pair of boxers, hair sleep-ruffled, and bringing her a mug of coffee from their espresso machine. That's a hobby of Rio's that Agatha never minded because they're the only person she can ask for a black coffee and have them return with a cinnamon cappuccino.</p><p>But she <em>will</em> lose mornings like this. Agatha wonders if Rio has hesitated to lean in and kiss her head while passing over her coffee on more mornings than just this one—whether last night had just been the catalyst for her recognizing it.</p><p>"Sorry I was gone," They say, and if they can tell Agatha nearly lost her mind over it, they don't show it, "Happy birthday."</p><p>Agatha blinks. She'd almost forgotten about that.</p><p>"I was setting up." Rio nods in the direction of the door like Agatha has any idea what they're talking about.</p><p>She takes a gulp of her coffee, too hot really, and finally returns Rio's smile.</p><p>"Nice way to start my birthday."</p><p>Rio's smile sharpens a little like Agatha has fallen into some sort of trap. They lean back on one hand, showing off entirely for Agatha's viewing pleasure alone—and maybe she's been too obvious about how attracted to Rio she is because she swears they're fucking <em>flexing</em> for her.</p><p>"Could be nicer." Rio tilts their head as if waiting for <em>Agatha</em> to make the first move. And she does. Sort of. She shifts out from the covers, leans forward enough to warrant the shiver she can see run over Rio's body before pressing a light kiss to their bare skin, just under where the tape stops.</p><p>"I'll judge whether you get to touch me based on what you've got me for my birthday," She says even though she doesn't care too much about that right now, only cares about finally getting to hold some of the power again, "So lets hope I like it or I'll tie you to the headboard and make you watch me fuck myself over your face."</p><p>And then she leaves them, pulls on a pair of Rio's boxers and grabs a hoodie from the back of their door, tries not to audibly laugh when Rio hisses in pain, and she pictures them spilling hot coffee over their bare skin—caught in a daydream of what Agatha isn't sure would actually be a punishment.</p><p>She sees what Rio means about setting up now. There's balloons all over the floor, a banner hung from the doorframe, hand made paper chains from the ceiling, and presents on the kitchen table. Agatha has never had this before. Not to wake up to.</p><p>Agatha swallows down the temptation to cry at the thought that Rio would do this for her. She finds it harder when she <em>knows</em> that had they been given the opportunity, they'd have done this for her every year.</p><p>Agatha turns her attention to the familiar—Rio's record shelves. She closes her eyes and runs her fingertips along the spines like she's seen Rio do countless times and picks one at random. She can feel Rio's eyes on her the entire time—the only person's gaze she doesn't suffocate under.</p><p>It's easier to face Rio with the music lacing through her thoughts and giving her something else to focus on other than her beating heart and heavy breathing. Another day, she might have tugged Rio into a rhythmless dance, thrown her arms around them and played with the hairs at the back of their neck, not quite awake enough to stop herself from taking what she really wants from a life that isn't hers.</p><p>"This is nice." Agatha nods over to the table and tries to stop her heart from feeling too affected by Rio's small, pleased smile.</p><p>"Yeah?" They sound relieved, "You like it?"</p><p>Agatha sniffs, saunters over to sit in one of the chairs in a way that can only be described as <em>haughty.</em> She sips loudly on her coffee, "It's about time someone gave me the attention I deserve."</p><p>All Rio says when they join her is, "I know."</p><p>And they <em>do</em> know, Agatha supposes, being that it only took them one birthday and one Christmas of them asking her what she got, to never ask again.</p><p>"Is there an order?" She drums her fingers against the table. The pile on the table is only small but it doesn't much hinder her excitement.</p><p>Rio eyes them, licks their lips, so obvious they want to say <em>yes</em> so badly, but they lean back and say, "Go crazy."</p><p>So Agatha—with all the logic of a child, reaches for the smallest one first. If she'd really been paying attention to the way Rio twitched she'd have known this one might have been last in a Rio order of things. Inside the flat box is a print-out of a booking confirmation for a <em>relaxing romantic retreat for two.</em></p><p>"Rio," Agatha blinks down at the box, shuffles through the papers to see the pictures of what looks to be some sort of mansion, "What the fuck?"</p><p>"They, um—" Agatha can <em>hear</em> them swallow, and <em>good;</em> they must know it's <em>insane</em> to spend this much money on her, "Most of them say that when you're looking for two people. We share a bed a lot these days anyway so I didn't think you'd mind." Which isn't at all what Agatha was expecting them to say. She looks back down and rereads the <em>romantic retreat</em> part and Rio's nerves make a little more sense, "You <em>don't</em> mind, do you?"</p><p>It's not that Agatha <em>minds,</em> it's just that with the way things were last night, she'd expected them to start easing her into a breakup, but now she's been thrown for a fucking loop because now they're apparently going on a romantic getaway and Rio will have to keep up the charade for <em>weeks</em> until the date.</p><p>"Who said I was taking you with me?" Agatha says, tries to joke but it falls flat out of her mouth when she sees a crinkle form between Rio's brows and she can only let the silence last for a beat before she quickly throws out, "I am. Obviously. Why would I want to spend time being sweaty and fondled without the person I'm used to being sweaty with and fondled by?"</p><p>It works well enough that Rio looks more like they're thinking about the implications of Agatha's words—getting sweaty with her, etc—than taking any offense to not being taken on this <em>romantic getaway</em> with her.</p><p>Honestly, Agatha hadn't thought they'd be all that offended by her sort-of joke. It's all so fucking confusing.</p><p>She pushes past her gut feeling to analyze any of that and reaches for her second, size-ordered present. A box of her favorite chocolates, she understands, would probably have been present number one if Rio had insisted on a proper order. Agatha prefers her method; that way she doesn't have to linger with what feels like a print-out bomb in her hands, and instead can just ignore, ignore, <em>ignore,</em> until the actual day.</p><p>(And then she can panic and ruin her life. Probably.)</p><p>She pops one of the chocolates into her mouth—ignores Rio's <em>you'll ruin your breakfast</em> comment in favor of shoving another one in her mouth and stuffing up her cheeks like a chipmunk, makes an attempt at saying, "But they're my favorites!"</p><p><em>(Agatha's sixteenth birthday might have been the first to matter.</em></p><p><em>Not that it was a surprise, but when Hela had gotten a car for her birthday—just a week before Agatha's, she was more than a little embarrassed that the only thing her own mother graced her with was a reminder to be home before nine. On her birthday/halloween amalgamation of all nights. The only thing that saved her from </em>more<em> embarrassment was that her birthday that year fell on the weekend.</em></p><p><em>She couldn't even be sure whether she'd been forgotten or purposefully ignored.</em></p><p><em>But kind-beyond-reason Rio had asked when her birthday was </em>one time<em> when they first met, and by the time her sixteenth rolled around was thrusting a carefully wrapped box into Agatha's chest.</em></p><p><em>Rio's wrapping was all neat edges, and perfectly proportioned pieces of tape, and a purple ribbon that surely wasn't because Agatha had mentioned one time that it was probably her favorite color.</em></p><p><em>"Sorry, it's uh—" Rio's cheeks were dark and they couldn't quite meet Agatha's eyes, "Not much."</em></p><p><em>Agatha's heart and body didn't seem to understand '</em>not much'<em> and even though she tried to be careful, shaking, greedy hands couldn't stop her from tearing apart Rio's perfect wrapping to see a fancy looking selection box of chocolates. Her thumb brushed over the embossed lettering on the top.</em></p><p><em>"They're my favorites," Agatha had said, despite never having had them before, but the cautiously pleased look on Rio's face made her smile too, and then, just in case Rio </em>still<em> thought they'd given her the most basic of presents, said, "I can't remember the last time I had them though."</em></p><p><em>She wasn't sure if it was the fancy chocolates themselves or something to do with Rio that did actually make them her favorites.)</em></p><p>The last present—the biggest present, is oddly shaped, squishy to touch, and even Rio's wrapping perfectionism can't completely save it.</p><p>"What the hell?" She can't help but mutter as she unwraps the… stuffed rabbit?</p><p>"I saw him when I was thrifting," Rio taps their fingers on the table.</p><p>"You got me a child's old stuffed animal?"</p><p>"Well," Rio clears their throat, "I guess. I thought of you when I saw him."</p><p>To Agatha, this does at least make some sense—unwanted, unloved until Rio picked them both up. Agatha blinks back down at it. It's kind of cute, she supposes, with it's patches all over it's body, and it's little tail, and—oh, his little nose—</p><p>"He gave me the idea for the spa."</p><p>Agatha can't help it, her face backs away from the rabbit, hadn't realized she'd got so close in her inspection. She eyes it cautiously, just in case the rabbit starts talking to <em>her</em> too, and then she really <em>will</em> have lost it.</p><p>Rio seems to be able to read her mind though, which is almost just as discomforting since she knows exactly what she's hiding up there, "I gave him his own pamper day."</p><p>Agatha's stupid, stupid heart clenches at the thought of Rio bathing, and drying, and brushing this equally stupid stuffed rabbit. She thinks about them talking to him, telling him he's going to go to a good home.</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> when is her period due? She's only been awake half an hour and has nearly cried twice already. Stupid hormones.</p><p>She clears her throat, warns the tears to <em>fucking stay away</em> and says, "What's his name?"</p><p>Rio just shrugs, "He's yours. I didn't ask him."</p><p>She'll decide later, puts him back down before she gets too attached. For now, the only way she wants to spend her birthday is watching shitty comfort films and having Rio wring orgasm after orgasm from her between each one.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It can't last though. Agatha is grinding against Rio's thigh in a lazy bid for an orgasm, panting hot against the side of their neck and trying to not look like a creep committing Rio's mid-sex smell to memory.</p><p>She's vaguely aware of Rio's phone buzzing somewhere beside them.</p><p>"Ignore it," She mumbles when she feels Rio shift underneath her, "It's my birthday, you've gotta do what I say."</p><p>"When have I ever given you the impression that I <em>don't</em> always do what you say?" But they still don't ignore the call, finally getting hold of it.</p><p>Agatha doesn't think twice about snatching it from them, barely glances at it before pressing decline before throwing it onto the floor.</p><p>"I think you're going to have to make it up to me for even entertaining that," Agatha says, nips at Rio's jaw.</p><p><em>"Oh no,"</em> Rio says, not at all serious, lets Agatha reach for their hand and guide it between her thighs. <em>Fuck,</em> she's already made such a mess on them—</p><p><em>"Rio?"</em></p><p>They both freeze at the sound of Jen's voice.</p><p><em>"Did I hear Agatha?"</em></p><p>Agatha leans back to look at the phone on the floor, which proves to be a somewhat fatal mistake. All Agatha sees is Jen's confused face taking up most of the screen, and in the corner, her own wild mess of hair comes into view just for a second, maybe a glance of the upper half of her face, covering up the view of Rio's living room ceiling.</p><p>Agatha slams her body back into Rio's and she hisses in their ear, <em>"Why the fuck does she insist on video calls all the damn time?"</em></p><p><em>"Because she likes looking at herself?"</em> Rio whispers back.</p><p><em>"Then she should fuck herself in front of a mirror like the rest of us."</em></p><p><em>"Rio?"</em> Jen's voice comes through again, <em>"Are you with someone?"</em></p><p>It's the thought that Jen might think Rio has another woman in their apartment on <em>her</em> birthday, the thought of Rio ever being with anyone else ever again, that has Agatha scrambling up over Rio and rolling over the arm of the couch like she's in actual physical danger, before <em>shoving</em> Rio towards their phone, <em>"Talk to her!"</em></p><p>In what might be her most embarrassing moment to date, Agatha sits with her bare ass to the cold floor as she stays hidden.</p><p>"Jen, hi."</p><p><em>"Are you… naked?"</em></p><p>"Um," She can hear Rio clearing their throat and the blanket that's draped over the arm of the couch gets unceremoniously yanked away—presumably to cover Rio up a little, "I was napping."</p><p><em>"Right,"</em> Jen draws out the word like she totally believes them, <em>"I tried calling Agatha but her phone must be on silent. She never answered me about going out for drinks tonight."</em></p><p>Drinks. Right.</p><p>She'd kinda just been being a dick about delaying answering Jen for the fun of it, telling her she wasn't sure she'd be up to being the center of attention anymore once she hit thirty. It's a big responsibility.</p><p>Which isn't the case at all. She's been teasing Rio for weeks about the skirt she bought just for the occasion. She brought her whole outfit with her last night because she sure as shit wasn't going home to pick it up, but she just <em>maybe</em> forgot to <em>ever</em> tell Jen that <em>yes,</em> she's coming.</p><p>Rio stumbles around a response, "Uh. I can see if I can get hold of her for you."</p><p><em>"Tell her I'm not taking no for an answer, though."</em></p><p>"Sure, sure. Bye Jen."</p><p>She can hear Jen's short laugh ring out, <em>"Yeah, bye Rio,"</em> And then, the louder, incredibly damning next words come before Jen ends the call like nothing happened, <em>"Bye Agatha."</em></p><p>Agatha peers over the arm of the couch when she hears the call end tone to see Rio with their palms pressed into their eyes, head resting back on the seat.</p><p>"So," Agatha shuffles round to meet them, rests her hands on their knees, "Jen knows, apparently."</p><p>Rio's hands shift up to their head and they massage their temples like this is one massive headache. "I'll speak to her tonight."</p><p>"Who said we were going?" Agatha makes an attempt at what she does best, encourages Rio's thighs away from their chest, and straddles them, "Might just keep you here all to myself."</p><p>"But then where would you wear that skirt I've been hearing so much about?"</p><p>Mm. Rio makes a good point. She <em>does</em> keep teasing them with the promise of a skirt so short they'd be able to see her ass in it with barely any effort.</p><p>"Fine. But no more stressing on my birthday," She pats their cheek, and then switches up, doesn't want them thinking any more about it, "And you owe me a fucking orgasm later."</p><p>"I'll make you come so many times you pass out, if you want," Rio says, suitably distracted and entirely earnest.</p><p>"Do you promise?"</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Maybe her favorite present so far has been convincing Rio to let her choose their outfit for tonight. It doesn't hurt to have Rio lounging back on their bed with absolutely nothing covering them except for the tape on their chest, watching her rifle through their things in nothing but a thong and a full face of makeup.</p><p>It does a lot for helping her forget about her break up worries.</p><p>She throws a pair of boxers over her shoulder, loose black pants that Rio <em>always</em> looks good in, and is now avidly ransacking their sock drawer because she <em>swears</em> they have a pair that match perfectly with the dark olive knit polo she has draped over her shoulder.</p><p>The only thing that makes her pause is her fingers hitting something that definitely isn't socks. She pulls it out before she can stop herself and even though they're already too late, she's already seen what was in the discreet cardboard box, Rio essentially tackles her for it.</p><p>"Rio, what—"</p><p>It's maybe a good thing Rio hadn't <em>promised</em> to not stress any more today, because they kind of look like they might be sick.</p><p>"Can we just," Rio takes in a big gulp of air, can't meet her eyes, "forget about this."</p><p>"Rio, it's <em>fine."</em> She urges, reaches out to touch their arm, only for them to flinch away from her.</p><p>"Please can you just pretend you didn't see it or something?"</p><p>"You've packed around me before. I'm not—"</p><p>"Yeah, with a <em>strap,"</em> Rio sounds near hysterical. Agatha has <em>never</em> heard them like this, "This isn't that, Agatha."</p><p>"I know that," Agatha tries to keep her voice soft for Rio, reaches out again for them and this time they let her, "If this is something that's part of you sometimes… if this is something that helps you <em>feel</em> like you. Then how could I not be okay with that?"</p><p>She watches Rio work their jaw, hears their teeth grinding together as they think, "You're okay with it?" Agatha has never heard their voice sound so small.</p><p>"I like you, Rio," Agatha says, plain as it is, "I like <em>all</em> of you."</p><p>"Okay," Rio says, voice quiet and body still rigid, "I thought it might be weird."</p><p>"Why would it be weird?" Agatha often doesn't think before she speaks, but thinks she might need to start. She doesn't want Rio worrying for an answer they don't need to give, "It's not weird."</p><p>Rio wets their lips though their mouth sounds dry, "I don't use it most of the time anyway," Agatha doesn't want to press and make them uncomfortable, but Rio lets out a shaky breath and continues, "Just sometimes when I go out. I feel more confident."</p><p>"Well," Agatha breathes a sigh of relief when Rio finally looks her in the eye, holds contact, "If it counts for anything, I think confidence is sexy."</p><p>"Oh. Cool," Rio says like they're sort of lost in Agatha's eyes, and she can see the exact moment their response registers because their eyes flutter and their cheeks darken.</p><p>Cute.</p><p>She doesn't want to push any further for something they might not be ready for, and so just cups their face, strokes her thumb over their cheek, "You don't ever have to hide around me."</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't really know if her words have had the intended effect until she joins Rio in the living room, both of them now fully dressed. She swears she doesn't mean to look but reasons that it's probably fair with the way Rio's eyes immediately drop to the almost obscene amount of leg on display in her mini skirt.</p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Rio breathes, eyes lingering, "I know you said it was short but…"</p><p>Agatha takes in the way Rio's sitting on the couch, the spread of their legs as they watch her. It makes her feel even more fucking powerful than she already does in her mini skirt/knee high boots combination as she edges closer, almost standing over them.</p><p>And, <em>god,</em> she doesn't say anything about it because it's not about <em>her,</em> and it's not about <em>them,</em> but Agatha can see the slight bulge in their pants—just big enough to see because <em>sue her,</em> she's looking for it.</p><p>She gets close enough to encourage Rio's hands to her thighs and they go willingly, looking up at her like they want her to ruin them before, still making eye contact, they lean in to press an open mouthed kiss to her thigh, just where the hem of the skirt is.</p><p>"You keep that up and we won't be leaving this building."</p><p>Rio's lips twitch and they plant another kiss, this time to her inner thigh, "I'm not seeing the issue."</p><p>But even as they say it, their phone buzzes from next to them and their eyes flutter closed a little before they pull back to check it.</p><p>"The uber's here."</p><p>Right. Sometimes she thinks she might have a problem. She's having sex more regularly than she ever has and she's still always fucking horny. She doesn't want to inflate Rio's ego by telling them they're the best fuck she's probably ever going to have.</p><p>And now she's going to spend the night with her other friends <em>and</em> Rio when her underwear is already kind of sticking to her. Fucking perfect.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is tipsy.</p><p>It's her birthday and it's a big one so she's definitely allowed.</p><p>It's just—the times she isn't a sad drunk, she's a horny drunk. And she can't be a sad drunk because it's her birthday, and even though she <em>hates</em> when the bar is busy, she doesn't hate when Rio pulls her into their lap with the lack of seats. And she <em>definitely</em> doesn't hate feeling their cock pressed against her.</p><p>So yeah, she's horny tipsy.</p><p>Agatha had sort of expected Jen to strike as soon as they turned up, and she might have been, what with her gleaming eyes and verging on terrifying grin, but Rio had spun her almost immediately in the direction of the bar, calling over their shoulder that 'the birthday girl shouldn't have to buy her own drinks'.</p><p>Jen looks happy enough and less manic when they both come back, and Agatha is mostly just grateful that she doesn't have to deal with any of that tonight. So she puts it out of her mind, doesn't think about what Rio could have said, doesn't think about her feelings, just moves through the night entirely with her libido in mind.</p><p>Which is easy when Rio is there to put a steadying hand on her thigh, her lower back. Harder when she leaves them to go to the bathroom and finds herself suddenly alone with Jen who doesn't seem to be there for any reason other than to catch Agatha alone.</p><p>"Do you think you'll want to settle down now you're older?"</p><p>Agatha methodically washes her hands, thinks maybe if she ignores her, Jen will stop talking to her, but no dice.</p><p>"I'm thirty, not three hundred. I have plenty of time to settle down if I want to," Then she flicks the water from her hands in Jen's face, "Which I <em>don't."</em></p><p>"You don't think you'll change?"</p><p>"Do you have a problem with me sleeping around, Jenny?" Agatha says, though even she can't picture wanting to go back to how she was before.</p><p>"You never know who you might meet."</p><p>Agatha just grunts and pushes past Jen to the door, "What makes you think meeting new people is ever an enjoyable experience for me?"</p><p>"Well, maybe you should look closer," Jen stops her before they can quite reach the group, and she looks exactly like this is the direction she wanted to shift the conversation in anyway. Agatha can't get a fucking read on where this is going, hates that she can't quite get ahead of her this time. "Maybe you've already met the right person."</p><p>Agatha scoffs, doesn't realize her eyes flitting over to where Rio is sat, head tipped back in laughter, before it's too late. Stupid tequila.</p><p>"You wouldn't date a friend?" Jen pushes.</p><p>"I think you have the wrong idea."</p><p>Jen wraps her hand around Agatha's wrist, looks at her with something horrible resembling <em>pity,</em> "I don't think I do."</p><p>The back of Agatha's neck feels hot. Actually, Agatha's fairly sure her <em>everything</em> feels hot, "It would be blow-up-in-my-face catastrophic."</p><p>"Not necessarily." Jen says, like it's so <em>easy.</em></p><p>"Yes," Agatha says with a finality she knows will soon be true, and since Jen already knows, it can't hurt to just be honest about it, "It would. Love and sex and caring for someone is fine but it doesn't make a relationship. <em>I</em> can't make a relationship. And where would that leave me and my <em>friend?"</em></p><p>Jen doesn't try to bring it up for the rest of the night.</p><p>And because she knows Rio won't fuck her, won't empty her brain of these fucking <em>thoughts</em> if she's past just tipsy, Agatha orders a glass of water in place of the shot of tequila she really wants.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It takes all of twenty seconds to get Rio's mouth on her cunt when their front door slams shut behind them.</p><p>(Agatha isn't thinking about the way Rio is down on one knee so that she, still wearing her boots, can rest a foot on their bent leg to keep her spread open.)</p><p>She has a hand fisted in their hair and her underwear around one ankle as she grinds onto their tongue. She swears she's been wet for half the night, thinks Rio's refusal to join her in the bathroom even once was maybe because they knew this is how they'd end up in there too.</p><p>Their tongue dips a little further down to push inside of her and Agatha <em>whines,</em> tightens her grip in Rio's hair. She loves when they do that, loves knowing how it's their tongue stretching her out, loves how dirty it makes her feel, loves knowing she's likely <em>dripping</em> into their mouth.</p><p><em>"Don't stop—"</em> She gasps, head slamming back against the wall, and to their credit, Rio doesn't, commits themself to <em>moaning</em> into her cunt like this is all they've ever wanted.</p><p>God, she's <em>right there,</em> it won't take much to push her over the edge—</p><p>Agatha barely gets a chance to mourn the loss of Rio's tongue inside her before they wrap their lips around her clit and lave their tongue over her in a way that feels almost aggressive, but Agatha <em>likes</em> a rough handling when it's coming from Rio, and with a rasping moan of their name, she tips into her release, hand flexing open away from Rio's head as she shakes.</p><p>They keep their mouth fixed to her cunt, lapping up her release until she comes back into her body enough that they start building her up again.</p><p>She'd usually let them, finds it hard to push their head away, and even harder when she sees Rio's pupil swallowed eyes and come slick chin. She almost drags them back in when their tongue darts out to lick Agatha's taste from their lips.</p><p>Agatha does <em>just</em> manage to refrain. It's not for wholly selfless reasons anyway.</p><p>She drags Rio up by their collar and leans in to taste herself on them, spins them around with a groan when it gets too much and <em>presses</em> Rio into the wall. "You've been driving me crazy all fucking night," Agatha says, pants against Rio's hot, wet mouth, "I've been able to feel you pressed against me."</p><p>Rio groans, hands flying to Agatha's hips as she pushes close, "You want me to go put the strap on?"</p><p>"Later," Agatha swallows, blinks the thought from her mind because she needs this so badly. She kisses them again, this time just to feel them against her, hand drifting down to their belt, "Is this okay?"</p><p>Rio's breathing is heavy when they pull back and Agatha can see the moment it clicks for them, "You <em>like</em> this."</p><p>It's not a question.</p><p><em>"Yeah,"</em> Agatha says, breathy, "I told you. I think everything about you is fucking hot."</p><p>"You didn't quite use those words."</p><p>"I didn't want to scare you off," Her hand rests on their belt buckle, "It's absolutely fine if you don't want this, but—"</p><p>Agatha's words are cut off when Rio shifts their grip to fucking pick her up, and she definitely only squeals a little bit as she wraps her legs around them, and her arms around their neck.</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em></p><p>They start moving towards their bedroom like this is all very normal, "I don't fully know what you mean when you're asking if I want this. But I trust you."</p><p>She knows. She <em>knows</em> they trust her, and <em>god,</em> even though she wants this desperately, has been thinking about it all night, she still needs more than anything to make this good for Rio. And it will be, Agatha thinks, she knows them well enough by now.</p><p>"Sit on the bed."</p><p>And because Rio is <em>very</em> good at following instructions, they do as asked, carefully lowering them both down. The show of strength is <em>stupid,</em> god, she needs them so bad.</p><p>Their hands find their home on her thighs as Agatha scrambles to pull Rio's top over their head, and then to undo their belt, begrudges the moment she has to stand to get their pants off. Just for them, just for the visual of it, she drops to her knees as she strips them. Rio, ever helpful, leans back and dutifully lifts their hips for easy access.</p><p>Her first thought is <em>they're not the boxers I picked out,</em> but her second is the more important realization that they must have swapped them out to pack with, that this wasn't a spur of the moment quick decision before leaving the apartment.</p><p>Agatha's hands find Rio's thighs, feels the soft hairs as she traces mindless patterns with her fingers. She hopes it comes off as a teasing move but it's more that now, on her knees, looking at the way Rio's filling out the front of their gray boxers, she's more than a little distracted.</p><p>Agatha doesn't notice she's leaning in until she has Rio's skin under her lips and she hums into the kiss, leaves a smudged lipstick mark on their upper thigh. Her fingers curl and dig into their skin with the effort it's taking not to push a hand under her skirt and rub herself to another quick orgasm and she has to close her eyes for a moment to cut that thought off.</p><p>She uses Rio's legs to push herself up, gets them to scoot back further into the middle of the bed, and climbs onto their lap, hovering above them. They immediately push themself up to meet her, to get their hands on her but Agatha pushes them back down with a hand on their chest, "You just stay there and look handsome for me, alright?"</p><p>"Alright." Rio nods quick, their voice scratchy when they speak.</p><p>"I want to grind on you," Agatha says, making sure not to touch Rio's cock before she knows they're comfortable with it, "Is that okay?"</p><p>Rio's eyes widen and they stutter out a <em>yes.</em></p><p>"Color?" Agatha asks, just to be sure, knows this isn't quite like some of the other things that regularly make an appearance in their sex life, but what is a safeword system good for if not to make sure her partner <em>does</em> feel safe?</p><p>"Green," Rio's voice cracks and Agatha doesn't even make fun of them for it, "Green, Agatha, please, I want to feel you."</p><p>Agatha doesn't want to deny either of them, sinks down until she can feel their packer pressed against her. Her skirt, with the way her legs are spread, isn't doing much at all to cover her now and she only has to shift it a little bit to watch as she grinds her hips, experimenting with the feel.</p><p>It's different to grinding on Rio when they're wearing a strap, it's softer, obviously—more pillow than arm of couch—and it takes her a moment to find the perfect angle, but <em>god,</em> even just the heady thought that this is <em>Rio</em> and not just one of their straps is incredible, and she can really only imagine how they feel about it.</p><p>Judging from the whine that leaves their throat and the quiver that Agatha can feel under her touch when she leans a hand back on Rio's thigh to steady herself, they're feeling good about it.</p><p>For just a few minutes, she can be a little selfless about this, does everything she can to make the angle visually pleasing for Rio, wants once more to give them something no one else ever has, no one else has ever <em>thought</em> to.</p><p><em>"Baby—"</em> Rio groans, hands reaching out for Agatha, "You look so good."</p><p>"I know," Agatha says, but decides to be even nicer to them and peels her top over her head, throwing it somewhere behind her and leaving her bare from the waist up. She didn't think ahead enough to bring a bra when she was packing a bag to bring to Rio's, but her nipples are her favorite accessories anyway.</p><p>Rio pushes themself up, holds themself with one hand while the other presses to Agatha's ribs, just under her breast.</p><p>Her instinct is to push them back down, but the way they're looking at her like she's the eighth wonder of the world and not just a hot woman in a tiny skirt with her tits out, keeps her from doing so.</p><p>"Fuck," Agatha encourages their hand higher as she slumps forward just a little as her clit drags over them at the right angle, "Feels good. <em>You</em> feel good."</p><p>"Yeah?" Rio cups her tit, flicks a thumb over her nipple, sounds pleased, "You think you could come like this?"</p><p>Honestly, Agatha thinks she could come from Rio blowing hot air on her cunt if she was in the right head space. She doesn't tell them that though.</p><p>She bites her lip and hums her agreement, rolls her hips down in a bid for more pressure, all thoughts about how it <em>looks</em> lost to her increasing desperation to come. Even against the fabric of their boxers, Agatha can feel how wet she is, and there's a little flicker of an image in the back of her head of when she pulls back to see the mess she's made on them that makes her whimper.</p><p><em>"Please,</em> Agatha," Rio bucks their hips to meet hers, drops back down against the bed to push both hands under her skirt, aids her movements with firm hands on her ass, "Wanna watch you come. Please, please, <em>please."</em></p><p>"Yeah, pretty boy?" Her words sound almost like they'll tip over into anger with the way her teeth are gritted, but she couldn't be anything but pleased with them. "You gonna be good and let me come on your cock?"</p><p>Rio whines, head tipped back to follow Agatha's face, and she can't help herself then, wraps a hand around their throat, squeezes light just to get their attention.</p><p><em>"Agatha,"</em> Their voice is breathy. Agatha thinks she can make it breathier, "Choke me, please, <em>please."</em></p><p>And so she tightens her grip on Rio's throat, watches their eyes roll back like they're the one getting pleasure from this. "So willing," She moans, "So <em>good</em> letting me use you like this."</p><p>Somehow, like their bodies are connected—probably a purely mental thing rather than a thing of soulmatism—every time Agatha tightens her grip she swears she can feel every single stimulus in her clit, and when she backs off, revels in their ragged breaths, the feeling spreads out.</p><p>"Want to be good for you," Rio says, eyes watery and <em>so, so pretty</em> for her, "Please, baby, you're so <em>close,</em> let me feel you, let me feel—"</p><p>Agatha's thumb dips to the center of their throat and she presses gently as she sees, unbidden, the image of Rio with a <em>collar</em> secured around their neck and not just her hand—oh, <em>fuck, fuck, fuck.</em> Agatha groans, hips working fast, doesn't stop until there's pleasure licking at the base of her spine, hand moving from Rio's throat to the mattress next to them to hold herself up as she comes.</p><p>It takes a moment to fully return to her body, hadn't expected to come so hard with only clitoral stimulation, but maybe things with Rio shouldn't shock her so much anymore. It's really the feeling of Rio shifting beneath her that brings her back, has her pressing a kiss to their sweat slick temple before pushing herself up on shaky arms.</p><p>It's as though they're trying not to bring attention to it—the subtle grinding of their hips like it's a totally mindless thing, like they want the focus to stay on Agatha, the way they always do.</p><p>"You need to come, handsome?" Agatha predicts Rio's whine at her words, brings her mouth to theirs so that she can swallow the taste of it.</p><p>Rio stutters out what might possibly be an attempt at her name, but against Agatha's lips it just comes out as a gasping moan.</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha says. The lines of Rio's body are taut, like they can't bear to admit they <em>want,</em> "You've been so good for me today." And they have—they've spent the day giving Agatha everything she could want. Has watched her favorite films, has made her favorite food when they heard and felt her stomach rumble when they were pressing kisses to her wet cunt post-orgasm, her inner thighs, her lower belly, nosing against the light hairs there, all without taking for themself.</p><p>Agatha shifts her weight, straddles one of Rio's thighs to give herself the access she needs, hand drifting down, gasping when she cups them, feels the wet patch she's left on Rio's boxers. Her fingers stretch just a little further, tentative, eyes on Rio's face as she feels for their clit, "Can I touch you?"</p><p>Rio's breath is shaky and they don't respond right away. Agatha is about to pull away, to tell them they don't have to do anything they don't want, but their hand around her wrist stops her. "You want to?" They say, and the question seems almost silly when Agatha feels this desperate for it.</p><p>Maybe Rio isn't quite the mind reader Agatha had thought.</p><p>And instead of saying <em>you deserve this,</em> or <em>I want to return the favor,</em> Agatha hears the question for what it is. "I want to touch you," She says, happy when Rio's hips buck into her hand and her fingers slip, can feel the mess Rio's made in their own boxers just from watching her. Agatha knows they like to be touched on their own terms—directly or indirectly on different days depending on how they feel. She also knows they <em>prefer</em> to be touched when they know Agatha will get something out of it. "I wanna make you come so you last longer than three strokes when I get you hard and inside me."</p><p><em>"Yes—"</em> Rio hisses, nods small and quick.</p><p>"Like this?" Agatha says, fingers pressing against them through their boxers.</p><p>"Yes," Though she watches as their brow furrows, "But also I want your mouth."</p><p>Her mouth?</p><p>Agatha blinks, doesn't want to ask too many questions and make them shy away from this, so she just says <em>okay, okay</em> and shuffles down the mattress til her face is between Rio's thighs and she can <em>see</em> her arousal sticking to Rio's boxers, can see the smeared lipstick she left on their thigh earlier and silently wishes she could keep it there forever.</p><p>She takes in a shaky breath, eyes flitting up to meet Rio's just briefly before they avert their gaze to the ceiling after less than a second. It does help to confirm she's right, though.</p><p>Agatha feels out Rio's clit and then, when she has it under her thumb, when Rio's hips jerk up into her hand, she leans down and presses her lips to Rio's packer, tastes her own come on the material.</p><p>Rio's hands are fisted in the sheets either side of her head and she pulls away just enough to see the way they still have their head tipped back, firmly not looking at Agatha.</p><p>"Baby?"</p><p>Rio hums but doesn't move.</p><p>Agatha reaches for their hand, strokes over their knuckles for a moment before she encourages it to her head, fingers tangling unthinkingly in her hair. Good.</p><p>"Please, look at me," She says, smiles when Rio's other hand releases its grip on the sheets and moves to prop up their head to do as Agatha asks, "That's it."</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes then, presses her tongue to the soft curve of the packer, makes a small circle around Rio's clit. It won't take long for them to come, she doesn't think. Not with the way their grip immediately tightens and they let out a breathy, <em>fuck.</em></p><p>She keeps to a steady rhythm with her thumb, focuses on it, on making sure she doesn't catch Rio off guard, and lets her brain empty out of coherent thought for everything she's doing with her mouth—desperately presses her mouth to every part of their cock that she can.</p><p><em>"Agatha,"</em> Rio chokes out after what must have only been a few minutes, their hand holding her head down as their hips jerk up to meet her mouth, "I'm gonna—"</p><p>Agatha moans, digs her thumb a little harder into their clit until she hears them all but squeak at the surprise touch that flings them into their orgasm.</p><p>Where before, Rio had seemed to be waning, getting a little pathetic with every touch Agatha had to offer them, after their orgasm they seem to be rejuvenated. They take a few seconds for recovery before re-finding their strength and rolling them over—gets Agatha underneath them, hands fitted under her thighs as they fold her nearly in half.</p><p>They bear down, fit their cock against her cunt once more just to be a fucking tease about it since they can't do anything when they're not hard like she needs.</p><p>Agatha tries to playfully shuffle out of their grasp, then tries a little harder when she doesn't get anywhere at all with it.</p><p>"No baby," Rio says like they hadn't been pathetically whining for her just two minutes ago. <em>Fuck,</em> Agatha needs to withhold orgasms much more if this is how their ego swells, "You've had your fun. Now, you're gonna let me get hard for you and then I'm gonna fuck you until you pass out in this slutty little outfit."</p><p>Agatha's eyes roll into the back of her head. She can see how this will play out—she will scramble from the bed when they leave her for all of thirty seconds, she'll get roughly manhandled right back into position, Rio pinning her down and reminding her of the strength she sometimes forgets they possess, and then she will let Rio ruin her, and in turn she will ruin their sheets. But still, she lazily smirks up at them like she has all the power, "You can try."</p><p>It seems her mother was right about one thing. Ignoring the issue sure does make it shrink to near inexistence.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It takes just two days from Agatha taking the stuffed rabbit home for her to give it a name.</p><p>It takes another one for Scratch to make his way into her bed, his fluffy little head pressed to Agatha's mouth, right under her nose so she can inhale Rio's lingering scent.</p><p>No, she doesn't come anywhere close to crying when she wakes up on the fifth day and finds that he'd fallen onto the floor in the middle of the night.</p><p>And no, she doesn't tell Rio any of this.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>There's a night—closer now to the trip Rio has planned, and so close too, to the inevitable end of all of this. Rio is in the kitchen and, by the sound of it, fighting with the night's second bottle of wine.</p><p>Agatha is sat on the floor the way they've both been all night—even though she's older now than she was in college and she probably won't be able to feel her ass tomorrow. She casts a glance to the couch to where she'd left Scratch the bunny sat up against a cushion and doesn't think too hard about shuffling over to snatch him, looking over her shoulder to check she hasn't been caught.</p><p>It's just that sometimes in the dark of the night, Agatha pictures herself with Rio. A relationship. But no matter how hard she tries, she can't seem to shift the image from what they have now—just the two of them spending their evenings together, cooking together, laughing and joking together, and then falling into the same bed.</p><p>Maybe, not that Agatha has too much experience to know with certainty, but maybe a relationship <em>is</em> just friends that love and fuck each other.</p><p>If she took herself out of the equation, would Agatha see their relationship as romantic? Surely not. There must be something that she, as someone who absolutely does not date, can't imagine when she thinks about a relationship. It's not like she's ever confused Rio for her partner.</p><p>Really, this is something she needs to talk to her best friend about, but that's impossible. And so, she goes to the next best thing.</p><p><em>"Scratch?"</em> Agatha holds the bunny close to her face as she whispers, <em>"Do you think there's a chance Rio could like me?"</em></p><p>Before she gets a chance to discern an answer from his fluffy face, Rio says from the doorway, "I <em>knew</em> you liked him."</p><p>Rio's grin is toothy and Agatha can't quite be mad at being interrupted. The jig is up, oh well. She rolls her eyes and pats the floor, hugs Scratch to her chest, under her chin.</p><p>Rio is halfway to the floor when they falter, "Shit. I left the glasses in the kitchen."</p><p>Agatha does the job for them and tugs them down by their sleeve the rest of the way, forcing them to land a little heavy on the floor.</p><p>"Don't care about glasses." She makes a little grabby hand towards the bottle. She doesn't say she doesn't want them to leave again.</p><p>"So, what's his name?"</p><p>"Scratch."</p><p>Rio doesn't question the maybe odd name, just nods like this makes perfect sense and then extends a hand out to hold one of his front legs to give it a shake and tells him it's nice to meet him.</p><p>Agatha's heart flutters in her chest. Stupid thing.</p><p>She takes a swig from the bottle before her heart forces words out of her lips that her brain usually has a firm grip on, before passing it to Rio.</p><p>"Can I tell you a secret?" Rio says, eyes glassy and wine stained lips twitching.</p><p>Agatha blinks, nods just once like moving more might scare them off. She doesn't know what they're going to say, but—</p><p>"Sometimes I think wine tastes better straight from the bottle. Don't tell Jen."</p><p>It's not even that funny, but the way Rio has their finger pressed to their lips like this is the biggest secret they've ever kept makes her laugh until she almost cries—probably from the absolute absurdity of her own secret. They both lean into each other to keep upright.</p><p>Once her laughter has quieted, she says, just because she likes to know things about Rio—covets information like currency, and because she's finding there's still a lot left to learn about them, "Do you miss being someone's partner?"</p><p>Rio's laugh is just dying off and they hum, "Like… a business partner?"</p><p>"When the fuck were you someone's business partner?" Agatha nearly chokes on her wine, "Why would I ask you that?"</p><p>"I—oh."</p><p>And all it takes is another glance at each other to set them both off into laughter again.</p><p>"What is in that <em>wine?"</em> Agatha wipes a tear from her eye.</p><p>"Nothing," Rio says, "It's just me, I'm really funny."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, because if she doesn't she <em>will</em> laugh again, and she doesn't need Rio going around with the false understanding that they're funnier than Agatha.</p><p>"You know," Rio starts, after a minute of silence. Agatha almost jumps at the sound, "I've never loved that."</p><p>Agatha's brain crackles as it tries to figure out what Rio means, "Hm?"</p><p>"Partner."</p><p>Agatha chews on her lip, takes another drink, "What would you prefer?"</p><p>Rio's cheeks darken and they snatch the bottle back like it might be able to hide them, "I don't know."</p><p>"Yes, you do."</p><p>Rio huffs, "No, I—"</p><p><em>"Lover?"</em> Agatha drawls in an over the top voice and Rio blushes harder but shakes their head, "Okay, um—" Agatha is already having way too much fun with this, "Companion?" She can barely hold back a laugh, "Significant other?"</p><p>"Bit of a mouthful." Rio mutters but they're smiling.</p><p>"I'll give <em>you</em> a mouthful."</p><p>"I thought that was <em>your</em> thing?" Rio raises an eyebrow at her and Agatha thinks she does <em>very</em> well to only very briefly let her eyes fall down between Rio's legs.</p><p>She clears her throat, "Love bug?"</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>Agatha just shrugs, tries to fight her smile to feign seriousness, "If you don't tell me, I'm gonna have to assume it's love bug."</p><p>Rio tilts their head back like they're looking for some other entity to intervene and save them. Nothing happens and so they scrunch their eyes closed and say, "I think I'd like boyfriend."</p><p>Agatha's world sort of slows down.</p><p>"Boyfriend," She murmurs but Rio doesn't notice, just rambles about something Agatha can't hear past the ringing in her ears and her thudding heart.</p><p><em>This is Rio. My boyfriend.</em> She thinks about introducing them like that. Now that she has the right term—something that just makes <em>sense,</em> that <em>clicks,</em> Agatha starts to feel dizzy and not from the wine.</p><p>She tunes back in to catch them say, "I know it's unrealistic, and no one would ever call me that—"</p><p>"I would," Agatha says before she can even think about it. She thinks she might be sick with what honestly feels like fear coursing through her veins.</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"I just mean," Agatha rushes to get out, steals back the heart that had somehow escaped to her sleeve, "I think someone else who really likes you would call you that. If I loved someone—" She swallows hard at her mistake but thinks correcting it would bring too much attention to it, "I would call them my boyfriend if it made them happy."</p><p>Agatha can't read the expression on Rio's face, and she's so <em>tired</em> of this new development. It seems the more she finds out about Rio, the less she knows.</p><p>As Agatha has often found, her pursuit of knowledge leaves her more often than not with unintended consequences.</p><p><em>Stop looking for that which you have no rights to,</em> her mother's words ring in her ears and she had never been able to picture a situation in which knowledge <em>isn't</em> power. Agatha thinks she gets it now.</p><p>The look on Rio's face passes and soon Agatha can see the little gap between their front teeth. She can only feel relieved that they choose not to push her.</p><p>"Do you think Scratchy likes wine?"</p><p>The laugh that escapes Agatha's throat sounds wet, and she pulls Scratch further into her chest, pouts and glares at Rio, "He's, like, two weeks old."</p><p>Rio shrugs, "Start 'em young."</p><p>The night carries on like Agatha had made that whole conversation up in her head. But what <em>is</em> real is the litany of <em>my boyfriend, my boyfriend, my boyfriend,</em> that pounds through her head.</p><p>Maybe, if Rio doesn't do the right thing and end things soon, she'll have to do it herself. Agatha doesn't doubt herself often, but she <em>does</em> doubt her ability to be normal about this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Almost three weeks have gone by and everything in Agatha's life seems to be hitting her like some vengeance fueled nightmare—the kind of thing that seems to be reaching inside of her brain and pulling everything she's trying to forget into her reality.</p><p>Someone else might say they wouldn't wish the constant battering reminder on their worst enemy, but honestly Agatha would wish it on even the woman who might be Karen, or Sharon, or even Susan—she's been told countless times and still can't remember—sitting on the table next to her in her favorite coffee shop, if it meant she didn't have to be the one going around witnessing total fucking strangers getting what <em>she</em> wants.</p><p>(Now that she knows what she wants she feels <em>stupid</em> for not seeing it before.</p><p>A relationship. Rio as her <em>boyfriend.</em></p><p>She'd been so focused on just keeping them where they are, on the possibility of Rio ever <em>liking</em> her, that she hadn't even thought about what that <em>meant.)</em></p><p><em>God,</em> suddenly, she's overhearing people everywhere she goes talking about their relationships. It's nausea inducing.</p><p>In this coffee shop alone, there's a girl who's gone <em>past</em> the stage of giddy and into something else entirely, telling her friend how she's <em>'always liked him, but didn't know how he felt until last night'.</em> There's the couple sat on a couch resting their heads together with small smiles on their faces, fingers intertwined and resting in the small space between their legs.</p><p>Just yesterday, she even almost tripped over a man proposing in the middle of the street, which is just <em>selfish;</em> she could have snapped her neck or something equally as dangerous as thinking about Rio proposing to her. Honestly, Agatha might take the grievous bodily harm at this point.</p><p>Karen/Sharon/Susan has become something of a gossip buddy over the years they've both been coming to <em>Dottie's Cafe</em> for coffee and sitting at the same tables right next to each other. And by that Agatha means she rants about everything going on in her life, gets given advice from someone older but not wiser than her—decides depending on the vibe of the day whether she's actually going to listen to any of the advice, and then she daydreams as Karen/Sharon/Susan shares her own woes.</p><p>"So, I'm thinking I should be the one to do the breaking up," Agatha concludes, shrugs like she can't see the horror on Susan's face.</p><p>"But we <em>like</em> Rio," Susan buries her head in her hands, "Don't we think this is the wrong decision?"</p><p>"Susan," Agatha ignores the wince from the other woman—alright, Karen then, "It's going to end someday anyway. And Rio clearly doesn't have the balls to do it, so why not just put myself out of my misery?"</p><p>Karen grimaces, looks for a minute like she might say something but then takes a shaky sip of her coffee.</p><p><em>"Yes,</em> we like Rio," Agatha continues, "But that doesn't mean we can be together."</p><p>Before Karen can do anything to change her mind, Agatha's phone buzzes against the table.</p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/>
<em>I'm outside</em></p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>They're early. And by that Agatha means <em>she's</em> very, very late. Rio is meant to be picking her up to take her to this <em>romantic getaway</em> disaster in exactly one minute.</p><p><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/>
<em>um. so i'm not home</em></p><p>"Is that them?" Nosy Karen tries to peer over at Agatha's phone. It buzzes again and Agatha angles her body away.</p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/>
<em>Lol</em><br/>
<em>I'm outside Dottie's</em></p><p>Agatha blinks down at her phone, then whips her head to look outside the window, could spot Rio's old dykey Subaru a mile off, parked on the curb on the other side of the street.</p><p>"Well," Agatha's chair squeals when it drags across the floor as she stands, "This has been lovely, Karen. As always."</p><p>"It's <em>Sharon,"</em> Apparently Sharon insists. Agatha thinks maybe she'll remember it this time—it was at least in her name rotation today. "And <em>don't</em> br—"</p><p><em>"Bye Sharon!"</em> Agatha calls as she swings her bag over her shoulder.</p><p>She can see it on their face as she approaches the car that Rio is amused. Maybe even smug. Agatha doesn't even have to ask—not that she was going to give them the satisfaction—but Rio says, "You can't function without your morning coffee," A beat where the corner of their mouth tugs up even further, "Even though you never order your favorite."</p><p>Agatha waves off Rio's comment, no matter how right it is.</p><p>She speaks up when she realizes Rio's going the wrong way for her house, but they only laugh like it's obvious.</p><p>"I picked your stuff up already."</p><p>Agatha goes to speak before she remembers Rio has had a key to every place she's lived since she moved out—just in case of emergencies. She's not stupid enough to leave a spare key under a plant pot and she trusts Rio a lot more than terracotta.</p><p>"I know you, Agatha," They say, eyes on the road like they haven't just offered up something for Agatha's rampant brain to latch on to for their entire journey. Because Rio <em>does</em> know Agatha. They know her better than anyone because that's the way she's designed it.</p><p><em>Is this what a partner would do?</em> Agatha thinks but has to correct even her own thoughts when it doesn't sound right. <em>Is this what her boyfriend would do?</em></p><p><em>Fuck.</em> Agatha slumps down in the passenger seat, stuffs her hand down the side to feel around for the lever to recline the seat a little.</p><p>It's going to be a long drive.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Usually, on a drive as long as this, Agatha would fall asleep. Agatha <em>loves</em> a nap—can and <em>will</em> nap anywhere. But this time, sleep evades her. She can't get her brain to shut up long enough to get anywhere close to sleep.</p><p>The only thing rattling around in Agatha's mind is the thought of getting to call Rio her boyfriend. The whole time they've been doing this—since Agatha fell in love with them—it's been hard to act like she doesn't want them. It's much harder to act like she doesn't want this to be real.</p><p>A romantic getaway for her birthday, sleeping together most nights, having sex and exploring new things with each other, feeling excited when she gets to see them. It's <em>confusing.</em></p><p>Not that it matters—they're not going to date. And anyway, <em>that</em> whole thing would only end in more heartbreak, and Agatha isn't even sure she's going to survive the end of <em>this.</em></p><p>Agatha doesn't <em>do</em> relationships. They don't work because <em>she</em> doesn't work. There's just something fundamentally wrong with her—or that she is just fundamentally unlovable.</p><p>And it's not like any of Rio's relationships have ever lasted very long either. Marla, or whatever her name was, was probably their longest and that just barely hit half a year. They're something of a serial dater—always jumping to the next thing whenever the smallest thing goes wrong. Not that Agatha's complaining. She wants her friend to be happy but she doesn't exactly like sharing them. Rio is the same way with dating as they are with all of their hobbies—past, present, and likely future—they get infatuated quickly, bored even quicker, and so the two of them <em>together</em> would be nothing short of disaster.</p><p>Not worth risking their friendship for.</p><p>Sometimes, Agatha thinks, eyes tracing the perfect slope of Rio's nose from behind her fluffy coat that she's using as a blanket, sometimes, in the early hours of the morning, when the layers of her brain are peeled back to their softest state—where they lack the protection of her mental shield—Agatha thinks Rio might like the idea of a relationship with her.</p><p>But the thought of them getting bored of her six months down the line—of <em>her</em> and not just the sex or the idea of her—sort of kills her.</p><p>"I can feel you staring at me." Rio's voice breaks her out of her trance-like state. Their eyes remain on the road, both hands on the wheel at ten and two.</p><p>"Am not," Agatha says, petulant as ever, even though her eyes have been glued to Rio's side profile for the better part of an hour. Her face feels hot with the thought that they've known she was watching them this whole time and only just now brought it up.</p><p>"Sure," Rio says, simple and entirely like they don't believe her, "It's my handsome face, right? It's too distracting."</p><p>"Exactly," Agatha laughs, pleased to be given an out. She's not shy about being attracted to Rio; it's her feelings and her inner turmoil that she'd like to keep to herself. "I'm picturing <em>riding</em> that handsome face later tonight when I get you alone."</p><p><em>"Agatha…"</em> She can see Rio's face flushing and she smiles wider. They're so easy to distract.</p><p>"You brought the strap like I told you to, right?" She leans into it, squirms a little in her seat at the better line of thinking.</p><p>"Of course," Rio says, though there was never really any doubt—Rio is <em>very</em> good at listening to instruction.</p><p>"Good," Agatha's fingers are tingling from the anticipation of it already. There are things she wants, and she wants to make sure she gets them before she can't have <em>anything</em> anymore. She doesn't think that's a bad thing. "I brought one too. And my rope."</p><p>It's this that finally has Rio's eyes shifting from the road just for a moment, "We're only there for two nights. What could we possibly need two straps for?"</p><p>"Wouldn't you like to know?" Agatha smirks, leans back in her seat once more, eyes focused entirely on Rio white knuckling the steering wheel. Yeah, she's going to have her fun.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio <em>does</em> know Agatha well, she thinks when Rio, with both of Agatha's bags on their arms as well their own slung over their shoulder, fights to make it to the door first—a gentleman.</p><p>Agatha had only seen it from the outside on the picture from the print out Rio had given her for her birthday, but she'd been expecting something more clinical for a spa.</p><p>She's not complaining about the half brick walls and the deep green paint drenching the rest, or the stunning central fireplace, the low lighting, or the smell of sandalwood. It's sort of like she's stepped <em>into</em> Rio.</p><p>It's relaxing in a way that’s unforced.</p><p>Agatha likes to think she's in control of most situations, can read people well, doesn't get caught off guard regularly. From the second they walk into the hotel, she loses that control, drops its leash from her tight grip and forgets to pick it back up.</p><p>Her brain immediately grows fuzzy at that line of thinking, and she curses her perpetually horny brain just this one time for the thought—having Rio collared and kneeling for her—</p><p>"Agatha Harkness," The receptionist pulls her from her thoughts, drags every syllable of her name out like she's pulling it apart like one would do with melting cheese, "Yes, you're here for your birthday," She shifts her eyes to Rio, smiles at them, "I spoke with your partner over the phone."</p><p>"Oh, we're n—"</p><p>Rio starts to say, but Agatha's mouth is quicker than both Rio and her own brain when she jumps in to correct her, "Boyfriend."</p><p>Her heart immediately drops into her stomach when she hears the word in her own voice. It swirls into a pool of nerves and threatens to make her vomit all over the floor of this <em>very</em> nice hotel reception, but she's soothed when she sees the look on Rio's face—bewilderment mixing in with something close to affection.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio says, voice light and breathy, doesn't look away from Agatha, doesn't even blink, "I'm her boyfriend."</p><p>There's a beat and then the receptionist just says <em>sure</em> because this isn't a potentially life changing event for <em>her</em> the way it is for them.</p><p>This is, of course, going to set a precedent for the rest of their trip. A mistake that will cost her in all of it's brainless stupidity.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't say anything about the <em>boyfriend thing</em> when they carry all of their bags up to their room. They're both too distracted by the floor to ceiling mirror next to the bed for Agatha's verbal slip up to get brought up and for that she's happy.</p><p>(She's also just pretty happy about said floor to ceiling mirror and the possibilities surrounding that.)</p><p>"Do all the rooms have the big sex mirror or did you request that?" Agatha hooks her chin over Rio's shoulder, their face glowing hot against her skin.</p><p>Despite how they might seem, Rio isn't the same person they were when they first started doing this. They spin around, hold her hips in a firm grip and lean close enough for their lips to just barely brush against hers, "Does it excite you, baby? I know how much you love looking at yourself when I fuck you."</p><p>Agatha's eyes flutter closed—the image of the time she watched Rio fuck her in the reflection of their kitchen window becomes the only thing she can see. They're not wrong. Fuck, she can't believe she's never thought to move her mirror next to her bed.</p><p>She leans in to press their lips together but before she can get a real kiss out of it, Rio's hand snakes through her hair and holds her back. Agatha gasps at the pull, has to steady herself with her hands on Rio's waist.</p><p>"You can wait, baby," They whisper, so so cruel, "Don't want to be late for your massage, do you?"</p><p>And then they let go of her and step away, going over to their bag to start unpacking like absolutely nothing happened.</p><p>Fine. She can do that too.</p><p>The first thing she unpacks, because he's at the top of her bag with his nose near the zip that's slightly pulled down because she had to make sure he could <em>breathe,</em> is Scratch. She takes him out, presses a kiss to his head and then puts him in the middle of both pillows on the bed.</p><p>"You brought him with you?"</p><p>Agatha looks between Rio and the stuffed bunny, "What did you expect me to do? Leave poor Scratchy at home by himself?"</p><p>Rio kneels on the bed, shuffles over to Scratch and strokes a finger over a floppy ear, "Oh, he's <em>Scratchy</em> now, is he?" They say, grin plastered to their face.</p><p>"Shut up." Agatha glares at them with absolutely no hostility behind it.</p><p>"You didn't pack him in with the strap, did you?"</p><p>"I would <em>never,"</em> Agatha says, eyes wide, "Why do you think I packed two bags?"</p><p>Both of Rio's eyebrows shoot up like this is a ridiculous question to be asking, "You over pack on every vacation we go on."</p><p>"I don't usually have to pack your massive dick when we go though. I <em>needed</em> the extra space this time."</p><p>The flush on Rio's cheeks feels like a win.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>The <em>boyfriend thing</em> has, of course, created the exact problem she thought it would in that now she's said it, now that she's got it in her head and her vocal chords have made a home for it already; now that she's sees Rio's reaction—the preening they do when she says it, like they're <em>proud</em> to be Agatha's boyfriend, like she's someone to be proud <em>of,</em> she can't <em>stop</em> saying it.</p><p>She doesn't even think about it when she's getting her much needed deep tissue massage, which is to be expected because she can't think of much beyond <em>this feels incredible.</em></p><p>But when the masseuse says, "Have you ever had a massage before?"</p><p>And, "My boyfriend gives me them sometimes," is Agatha's only response, she's rightfully embarrassed.</p><p>It wouldn't necessarily be a big deal—red cheeks that the masseuse can't even see while she's face down on the bed, but Rio booked a couples massage. Because of course they did.</p><p>("Rio, you know you don't <em>have</em> to book the couples massage, right?" She'd said as they were heading down, "Like, no one's gonna jump out like <em>aha</em> and send us packing if we're caught doing something un-coupley."</p><p>Rio only shrugged, "I don't really have interest in doing any of these things without you."</p><p>Agatha could only be glad Rio couldn't seem to hear the violent flapping of the butterfly wings in her stomach.)</p><p>"I'm probably not very good, though." Comes Rio's voice, dispelling any illusion she might have had that maybe they hadn't heard her.</p><p>"That's not even a little bit true," Agatha mumbles, doesn't really want to talk or think about all the times Rio's had their hands on the various parts of her body post-sex right now.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Too much relaxation seems to have a terrible effect on Agatha's mouth. She wouldn't say she reins herself in exactly, but she's definitely learned to hold her tongue when it comes to oversharing about <em>herself</em> over the years.</p><p>Too much relaxation seems to affect Rio's bladder in the same way, because Agatha is alone at their table in the in-house restaurant and drumming her fingers over the wine list.</p><p>The place is <em>nice,</em> which is to be expected from somewhere as expensive as the hotel itself, and she's in a deep green dress that seems to make Rio walk into walls and doorframes. Whether that's from seeing her in their favorite color, or because of the almost indecent slit up the side of her thigh, she's unsure.</p><p>Rio usually orders for them when they go out these days—not because Agatha is incapable, but because she's come to be <em>so very generous</em> when it comes to giving them rewards when they order right for her. They're very cute, like a pet the way they always look to Agatha right away, the way they want to please her. She swears if they had a tail it would start wagging whenever she sends them to the bar just with the hope of being told <em>'good boy'.</em></p><p>Alas, Rio isn't here when their server comes to their table, but it only means they don't have to bear witness to her third—and hopefully final, since bad things come in threes—blunder of the day.</p><p>Agatha orders a glass of sauvignon blanc for herself, after triple checking it comes from New Zealand—she's not a <em>monster.</em> And then, unthinkingly, she says, "And my boyfriend will have a glass of malbec."</p><p>Her ears start ringing and she just barely hears the server saying <em>very good</em> before he walks away. She drops her head into her hands, can't even be bothered to keep up the pretense that shame doesn't set her veins on fire.</p><p>Thank god Rio has booked them both for a head massage tomorrow with how much internal battering it's taken today. It's like they knew she'd need it.</p><p>She stays that way until Rio, kind and caring Rio, comes back from the bathroom, puts a gentle hand on her bare shoulder so as not to scare her so much, and quietly asks if she's okay.</p><p>Agatha blinks up at them, doesn't think <em>'I keep calling you my boyfriend and I don't know how to stop while we're sleeping together'</em> is a sensible answer.</p><p>"Yeah," She smiles, and their drinks arrive before she can do something truly awful like tell them the truth, "I just thought maybe I'd made a mistake with my wine choice."</p><p>And then she takes the most obnoxious, slurping sip of her wine to back herself up.</p><p>"All good." She smiles with what is probably too many teeth, holds her glass up for Rio to clink against their own.</p><p>She tries not to think about how this feels romantic, like she's on a real date. And then she thinks back to the last time she was out alone with Rio at the little speakeasy for her birthday, and when they took her to the museum, and then she spirals thinking about all the times before they started this whole thing up, finds she can't separate the interactions all that well into <em>while we were sleeping together</em> and <em>before we started sleeping together.</em></p><p>Part of her misses how easy it was not to mistake the people she slept with for her friends or romantic partners.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>"That was nice of you," Rio says when the door to their hotel room clicks shut. They slip their shoes off and line them up next to the door.</p><p>They don't take anything else off, clearly want to wait for Agatha's permission after she'd earlier told them, <em>"Don't get another drink. I want your mind clear for what I do to you later."</em></p><p>"Hm?" Agatha thinks back on the night. She's not the nicest person the majority of the time so she has a hard time pinpointing something.</p><p>"Today," Rio clarifies, plays with the buttons on their shirt, nervous, "Calling me your boyfriend."</p><p>"Well," Agatha clears her throat, looks away. She'd thought maybe she'd be able to avoid this conversation altogether. She slips the straps of her dress off her shoulders, lets it fall down her body and pool at her feet. "If people are going to assume we're a couple, they should probably call you the right term."</p><p>She turns slightly when she bends to pick her dress up to give them the full view of the underwear she bought just for this trip.</p><p>Agatha can't help the smirk when she stands back up, looks over her shoulder at Rio who definitely isn't looking anywhere near her face.</p><p>"It, um—" Rio blinks and blinks until Agatha's snorting laugh knocks them from their distraction, "It felt nice. I wasn't sure if it was just something I <em>thought</em> I might like, you know, in my head."</p><p>"Good," Agatha says, all seriousness as she goes over to touch Rio, to cover the hands still playing with their shirt buttons, "I like when you tell me things. I like when I can make you feel good."</p><p>Rio nods, eyes roaming all over her face, and then once they've mapped every corner, they drop to her neck, and then lower. "Is that what you meant about keeping my mind clear?" Agatha takes this opportunity to pop open the highest fastened button—the fourth one down because apparently she isn't the only one feeling slutty tonight, "Making me feel good?"</p><p>"Maybe," Agatha says, hands working to swiftly open the rest of the buttons, selfishly wants to get her hands on them, feel their soft skin under her hands, "I've been thinking about something for a while."</p><p>"Oh yeah?"</p><p>Agatha can feel their stomach twitch under their touch, sensitive for her. She keeps one hand on their ribs as the other trails up their chest to the hollow of their throat, presses a thumb lightly into it before her fingers join, wrap around their neck. "Yeah."</p><p>Rio's eyes light up, but they manage to restrain themself from anything else, "I <em>knew</em> this was what you wanted."</p><p>Agatha's thumb moves around to the other side of Rio's neck, squeezes. The choking is nothing new for them but it's a favorite as well as a good base for what it is Agatha wants.</p><p>"And what do you think that is?"</p><p>"You always get this faraway look in your eyes when you have your hand around my throat, telling me I'm a good boy," Agatha can feel them swallow underneath her hand, can feel their pulse tick up, excited, "You want to put a collar on me so badly, baby."</p><p>Their eyes dart over to where she dumped her bags in the corner of the room, not entirely empty, gives away how much <em>they</em> want it too.</p><p>"I don't want you to get your hopes up," Agatha says, because she <em>hasn't</em> bought them a collar. She's thought about it, of course. She thinks they would look <em>handsome</em> in a collar, marking them as Agatha's property. But that's where the issue lies—Rio <em>isn't</em> Agatha's; they don't belong to her. There's just something so <em>permanent</em> about buying them a collar, like they're hers to keep. "But I was thinking if you trust me to, I could <em>make</em> you a leash?"</p><p>Rio lets out a tiny whine, likely involuntary based on how quiet, "With the rope?"</p><p>Agatha loosens her grip, strokes her fingers down Rio's throat to soothe, "If you'll let me."</p><p>"I want it. I trust you."</p><p>Agatha nods, backs away to her bag she left her rope in, "Take your clothes off and sit on the bed for me."</p><p>When she turns back around, taking the rope out of its holding knot, her safety shears dangling from one finger, Rio is sat, back straight and rigid, hands in their lap but fiddling with their fingers. Agatha brings the bag with the strap and a few other things, and leaves it on the floor next to the bed, puts the shears on the bedside table, quickly reaches over to turn Scratch face down into the pillow—he doesn't need to see this.</p><p>Agatha sits next to them on the bed, takes their hands and puts them on the rope so that they're holding it together.</p><p>"It's a very quick tie," She says, follows their eyes as their head dips down, "Very easy if you know what you're doing."</p><p>"And you," Rio trails off, the thumb rubbing the rope occasionally bumps into Agatha's own. She sees no harm in taking their hand. "You know what you're doing."</p><p>It isn't a question but she can tell Rio is curious either way.</p><p>"It's one of my favorites to use if I've been with someone a long time and they trust me. The knot isn't collapsing and won't tighten at all when it's fin—"</p><p>"You've done this tie with other partners?"</p><p>It makes Agatha pause. She can hear the clear jealousy in their tone and she doesn't want to upset them. She constantly walks the line of making sure they don't figure out how she really feels, and making sure they don't think they're just the same as everyone else she's slept with.</p><p>"None of them were as important as you," Agatha says, cups their face in her hand, feels her fingers ache where they touch their skin, feels Rio relax under her touch, "And I wouldn't do this now if I hadn't done it before. None of them ever meant anything to me."</p><p><em>Not like you do.</em></p><p>Rio nods, lifts the rope up, "I want it."</p><p>Their eyes flutter closed when she brings it up to their neck, just resting it against them so they can feel it, "Color?"</p><p>"Green," They say, eyes still closed like they want to focus on the feeling, and so Agatha begins, goes a little slower than usual in case they need to stop. For as much as Agatha likes Rio's hand wrapped around her throat, she's not too personally keen on a tie like this, and so wants to make sure Rio is okay.</p><p>Still, the tie is finished quickly, even with Agatha watching every minuscule movement of muscle. <em>Kit kat,</em> Agatha has been reminding herself, which seems very stupid but serves as a good reminder as she tests she can fit four fingers, not just the usual two, between the rope and Rio's neck, satisfied it isn't too tight.</p><p>"You're done already?" Rio opens their eyes, a hand coming up to touch the rope around their neck. Agatha lets them explore it.</p><p>"How does it feel?"</p><p>It takes them a moment to respond, their attention caught somewhere just past Agatha. Curious, she looks around to see them staring at their own reflection in the mirror.</p><p>"You want a closer look, baby?"</p><p>"Can I?" They're already itching to get up.</p><p>Agatha takes the end of the leash; somehow, from the look on Rio's face, they seem to have forgotten that it's not <em>just</em> a collar, and she encourages them up and over to the mirror.</p><p>Rio's chest heaves as they take in the image of them with Agatha's purple rope around their neck. For once, Agatha isn't mad about their eyes not being on <em>her.</em> She gets it—they look stunning.</p><p>"How does it feel?" She prompts again.</p><p>"Feels good. Brain kinda feels like it could melt away," Rio's eyes meet hers in the mirror, eyes mostly swallowed by their pupils, "I've—" Their eyes dart away, embarrassment flashes over their face.</p><p>"Tell me," Agatha gently prompts, hand gliding up the length of the rope so that it's more in Rio's line of sight, just to remind them she's the one in control right now.</p><p>"I've been wanting this too," Rio confesses, "Not <em>this</em> exactly, but—"</p><p>Agatha smiles, doesn't push them for more, "Are you happy to carry on?"</p><p>They nod, eyes widening a little, "Please."</p><p>Agatha loosens her hold on the rope in anticipation so that it can just slide through her hands without any friction, "Kneel."</p><p>Rio doesn't even seem to think about it before dropping to their knees, staring up at Agatha, fingers brushing against the floor. With the hand not holding the slack rope, Agatha buries her fingers in Rio's hair, scrapes her nails across their scalp and watches their eyes roll back. "Such a good pet for me."</p><p>Rio, head tipped back, lets out a strangled sound that has nothing to do with the rope around their throat. They don't answer and so she continues, "Look at us," and watches in the mirror for how Rio's eyes shift to look at her standing over them.</p><p>"Can I touch you?"</p><p>"I don't know, <em>can</em> you?"</p><p>Rio looks away from the mirror and back up to the real Agatha, "Please, may I touch you?"</p><p>"Good boy," Agatha moves to lean her back against the mirror, gently pulls the leash to have Rio follow, pulls it more when they're in place until their face is pressed against her covered cunt, "Keep your hands on the floor though."</p><p>There was no doubt in her mind that Rio would do as told and she tips her head back against the mirror too as Rio starts nosing against her.</p><p>When they're the one in control, Rio takes their time with it more, teases with their mouth as well as their words. But when they're not, it's like they can't help themself, can't hold back their desperation. There's no kisses pressed to her inner thigh this time, and they don't even try to pull their head back enough to figure out a way to move her underwear to the side, just moan and lick into the fabric like this is the reward she's offered them.</p><p>Agatha <em>likes</em> their obvious desperation though, feels how wet she grows against the gusset of her underwear, the barrier keeping Rio's mouth from her.</p><p>She props a foot up on their shoulder for the angle and to start up a grind against their mouth. Not that Rio is moving in any sort of rhythm right now, mouth somehow everywhere and nowhere all at once, whining every time they try to dip their tongue up inside her and have to settle for trying to suck her taste through the material. It's fucking pathetic.</p><p>Every time Rio's nose bumps up against her clit, Agatha gets a little bit closer to an orgasm she'd be embarrassed to have. She needs <em>something</em> else just so Rio can't make fun of her for this later.</p><p>"Rio," She's surprised how her voice comes out like a moan, "Want to feel your mouth."</p><p>Rio hums but doesn't make any move to abide her, too caught up in keeping their mouth on her as best they can.</p><p>"Rio, baby, I need your tongue <em>on me."</em></p><p>Her voice must crack through the clouds of their brain enough for them to hear her properly, and they use their teeth to pull Agatha's underwear to the side as best they can—just enough to get their mouth on her, tongue immediately slipping inside her and groaning at the taste.</p><p>She keeps them close, loves having them inside her any way she can. They figured out extremely quickly that she comes harder when she's had some form of penetration.</p><p>The only thing keeping her from coming <em>too</em> soon—because she doesn't even think the lack of clitoral stimulation will keep her from getting there—is the way her underwear keeps shifting back into place.</p><p>She grunts when it happens again, and for her own benefit, reaches down with the hand not holding Rio's leash to move it to the side and grant them better access.</p><p>It's fine, she thinks when she <em>finally</em> gets to feel Rio's tongue properly, she doesn't mind figuring out a punishment of sorts for having to do their job for them.</p><p>For now though, Agatha is stuck between never wanting to look away from them because they just look <em>so</em> good like this, and needing to give herself a break because watching how blissed out they look just from eating her out pushes her closer and closer to an orgasm with every stroke of Rio's tongue.</p><p>She loses when Rio drags their tongue up to lick over her clit, and then—the killing blow—opens their eyes, hooded and needy, and sucks it into their mouth.</p><p>Agatha slams her head back against the mirror, vaguely regrets in the back of her mind propping herself up on Rio's shoulder because her one remaining leg threatens to fail on her. Rio keeps their mouth working on her clit, doesn't even bother to slow down. Agatha isn't even given a chance to come back to herself, she blinks down at Rio as she hurtles towards a second orgasm already, to find Rio still looking up at her, and they hum like they're pleased when their eyes meet.</p><p>Agatha keeps their head in place with their leash and grinds against their face, sloppy and uncoordinated but she doesn't even care, just chases the pleasure mindlessly now. She doesn't even try to hold this second orgasm back, <em>can't</em> when Rio fucking <em>nibbles</em> on her clit like a psychopath, makes her bend nearly in half—forehead digging into the leg she has propped up as this orgasm tears through her and near threatens to end her life.</p><p>When she comes down, manages to uncurl her body, sweaty back plastered back against the cool of the mirror's surface, she lets Rio move away from her just enough that she can see her come all over their face.</p><p>"You taste <em>so</em> good," Rio says, breathless, and seeing them like this just makes Agatha burn to have them inside her.</p><p>There <em>is</em> the issue of them deserving it though.</p><p>"Bed," Is all Agatha says, and Rio's eyes light up again. They make a move to stand but Agatha presses a hand to their shoulder, pushes them back down, pushes her tongue into her cheek to hide her smile at the way their eyes grow big and pathetic, "What do you need to stand for?" She asks, waits for the question to sink in.</p><p>Rio's jaw seems to slacken in stages the more they comprehend what she's asking and she takes her bottom lip between her teeth, bites hard enough to taste blood, and then begins a slow walk over to the bed, leash in hand, her back to Rio.</p><p>She knows they're following, that they're on their knees behind her because the rope stays slack in her grip.</p><p><em>God,</em> how is she ever going to give this up?</p><p>Agatha lounges back on the bed, notes how Rio stays on their knees, fingers still just barely grazing the floor like they want to be <em>good</em> but are anticipating Agatha telling them to join her at any moment.</p><p>She lets go of the rope as she discards her underwear, tries not to grimace at the way it sticks to her with Rio's spit and her come, and then spreads her legs, lets Rio have a proper look at her the way, in their haste, they haven't been afforded tonight.</p><p>"Agatha," Their tongue darts out to wet their lips like they can taste her on the air and want the reminder, "You're so pretty."</p><p>"You say it like it's a surprise." Agatha reaches a hand down, spreads herself open with two fingers because she's nothing if not a tease.</p><p>"No," Rio is solid in their answer, "No, it's never been a surprise. I just like telling you. I like how you look when I compliment you, when I praise you."</p><p>Agatha itches with the need to ask <em>'how do I look?'</em> but just manages to refrain, doesn't want to come off <em>desperate</em> when she's the one who has Rio collared and on their knees.</p><p>"You see my bag, baby?" She says instead, tries to detract attention from her hot cheeks, "Get the strap and the lube from it."</p><p>Rio does as asked, and, like predicted, they grab the harness too.</p><p>Agatha sucks on her teeth like she's disappointed with them, "Did I ask you to get the harness?"</p><p>"I—" Rio looks down at the things in their hands like they don't understand what's happening, "No."</p><p>"Then I don't want it," Agatha takes hold of the rope again, says, "Come here."</p><p>Rio scrambles up onto the bed, straddles one of Agatha's thighs, doesn't seem to know where to look, keeps their hands to themself and doesn't try to push their luck. They're different from Agatha when she subs in that respect.</p><p>"Get it ready for me." Agatha makes lazy circles around her clit as, eagerly, Rio does as they're told—generously lubes the strap as their eyes stay locked on Agatha's cunt. She can't really blame them for looking at what they're not allowed.</p><p>Her hand fits over theirs to make them stop, seemingly content to mindlessly stroke the strap that's not even attached to them for as long as it kept Agatha happy.</p><p>"Do you know why you're not allowed to fuck me?"</p><p>Rio shoves their tongue into their cheek, brain whirring behind their eyes, and they shake their head.</p><p>Agatha tuts, "Do you really think it's okay to make me do all the work just because you're too pussy drunk to manage to get my underwear off while you eat me out?"</p><p>Rio's shoulders slump a little and they relinquish their hold on the strap, "No. I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha brings the strap to her cunt; she's so wet she probably didn't even need the lube, but watching them was nice for her. She glides its length against herself, bumps the head of it into her clit the way Rio likes to when they tease. Because really that's what this is—it's Rio's cock she's using to get herself off, no matter if it's on their hips or not.</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> she's probably gonna have to trash all of her toys, burn her rope when this ends if this is how she feels about it.</p><p>"Watch," Agatha grits out between her teeth, a useless command because Rio has never wanted to look anywhere else any time they've been together.</p><p>She pushes the toy inside of herself, not gentle like Rio usually is. The first thrust, most of the time, is slow to make sure she's okay—even if the second is rough and winds her. Agatha doesn't allow herself the same grace, stretches around it like how she does when Rio is unavailable—rare—or when she's on the phone and teasing them—often.</p><p>The groan tumbles out from the back of her throat and Rio shifts their body to hover more over Agatha as if they might be able to taste it as she breathes out.</p><p>She hadn't even realized her eyes had closed until she's blinking to focus on Rio's face.</p><p>"I thought I told you to watch," She says, doesn't stop her movements, feels herself begin to accommodate Rio's cock.</p><p>"I <em>am</em> watching," Rio replies, eyes locked on Agatha's, unblinking.</p><p>Agatha grips their face between her thumb and fingers, not gentle, "Don't play smart with me, baby," she says, and then tugs them with the rope so that they can't hover over her anymore, <em>"Watch</em> me."</p><p>And Rio doesn't make any more comments, just digs their fingers into Agatha's thighs as she pushes their cock deep inside her. They don't seem to be able to say <em>anything</em> when they're watching her like this. Rio's breathing matches her own—rapid and getting more irregular she more she speeds up her movements. Their fingers press into the muscle of her legs when she's as far in as she can go, when she can feel just how much she's dripping onto the backs of her own fingers, and then their grip loosens as she pulls out.</p><p>It's such a pathetic display it has her feeling almost <em>nice.</em></p><p>"This could've been you," Agatha doesn't think it matters how breathy her voice sounds, Rio probably can't hear tone past trying to process her words, "You feel so fucking good inside me."</p><p>She says it just to let them know she's still thinking of them, because she's <em>so</em> nice.</p><p>"Baby, <em>please</em> let me—" Rio whimpers, and Agatha can just about see how they start up a slow grind into nothing but the air that matches the pace of how she's fucking herself, "I wanna make you feel good."</p><p><em>God,</em> and she <em>knows,</em> "You <em>are</em> making me feel good, pretty boy."</p><p>Rio's eyebrows scrunch together and they do a good job not to vocalize their annoyance, likely in the hope for a reward.</p><p>She'll grant them a little bit.</p><p>"Rio," She says to make sure she has their attention, and as their eyes snap up to hers, they slow their movements, "I want you to grind on my thigh. I'm gonna let you use me, okay?"</p><p>Rio nods and breathes out a <em>yes</em> like if they don't answer in as many ways as possible she might take this from them.</p><p>Really, Agatha thinks as she feels slick heat meet her thigh, this is as much for her as it is for them. She gets to watch and feel Rio thrust in time with how she fucks herself and that really is the second best option here.</p><p>"Does it feel good?"</p><p><em>"Fuck,</em> yes—" Agatha watches a bead of sweat drip down Rio's neck, their eyes scrunch shut in She wishes they were closer so she could lick it from their skin.</p><p>"Good," She says, tries to keep her voice steady, "Because you're only allowed to come if you can get there before me."</p><p>And she doesn't wait before angling the toy to press inside her just where she needs it on the next thrust, feels herself clenching around it, her stomach doing the same. If Rio wants their orgasm they need to hurry up about it. They've always been a quick trigger—and that's why she gave herself this head start.</p><p><em>"Agatha—"</em> Rio cries out in some sort of anguish, rocks their hips heavy. And, oh, it's <em>fun</em> controlling her own pleasure because suddenly Rio isn't concerned about matching her pace, isn't focused on her pleasure the way they usually are no matter if they're domming or subbing for her. They know they can chase it in whatever way feels best for <em>them</em> because the angle, and the pressure, and the speed is perfect for Agatha no matter what they do.</p><p>"Don't be ungrateful, baby," Agatha pouts, wishes she had more hands to grip onto them, to force them to look at her. Next time. "Say thank you."</p><p>A moan tears from Rio's throat, and then, <em>"Thank you,"</em> and then they say it again—over and over.</p><p>The part that makes it hotter, the part that has her clenching around the toy, has her dropping the leash knowing Rio isn't going <em>anywhere—</em>all so she can rub fast, tight circles around her clit is that Rio sounds so <em>sincere.</em> They sound <em>so</em> genuinely grateful that they're allowed to have her like this, that it becomes their own downfall.</p><p>She tries to keep the build to herself as best she can, wants Rio to be taken completely off guard by her orgasm, but she can't help herself—bucks her hips up into her hand, breaks the skin of her lower lip in her effort to stay quiet.</p><p>And Rio knows it, <em>"Baby,</em> please,<em> please,</em> I'm close, please—"</p><p>Their begging—they should know this by now—only pushes her closer and closer to her orgasm. The force of her orgasm pushes Rio's cock from inside her but she can't even think to fight it, brain empty of everything but tv static as she comes, the hand that had held the toy flying to Rio's toned back to hold them close as she shudders through her orgasm.</p><p>Agatha is vaguely aware of Rio using what little strength they have left to hold themself over her, to look her deep in the eyes as she comes back to herself, hips just barely twitching against her thigh because they're too wound up to <em>stop,</em> but they know better than to try for an orgasm they're not allowed.</p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Agatha sighs, more in her body, but still not in her mind, "I love you."</p><p>Rio noses against her cheek, presses kisses there like maybe it doesn't matter, like she has nothing to be worried about, "I love you too."</p><p>Her heart thuds in her chest and she's worried it might collapse in on itself for a moment, might fall through to her back, thrash against her ribcage for release. "Sorry you didn't get to come." Agatha says, though the reminder of it makes her smile and she probably doesn't look very apologetic. But that's okay, she isn't really. She thinks Rio doesn't mind either way.</p><p>Rio hums, presses another kiss to Agatha's cheek before pulling back to look at her. Their eyes are still glazed, "'s okay. I like—" They swallow harsh, Agatha tracking the bob of their throat, "I like pleasing you."</p><p>"I know," Agatha says, soft as she can, runs her fingers down their back, "You're so good, baby."</p><p>Rio squeezes their eyes shut, <em>"God,</em> I was <em>right</em> there."</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha thinks she might look guilty enough to look sincere, "I know. That's kinda what made me come."</p><p>Rio's laugh is thin, "That makes sense," they say as they collapse with a small groan, resigned to the fact that Agatha is <em>not</em> going to make them come.</p><p>They lie together for a while and Agatha coos every time she feels Rio's hips twitch into her thigh, pretty much involuntary at this point, until they settle and they seem to be able to exist for themself rather than Agatha again.</p><p>"I think they have some fancy bath salts if you wanna get a bath before bed." Agatha breaks the silence after a while, doesn't want to be apart from Rio but she doesn't think they're likely to start relaxing until she starts proper aftercare. She's also very aware of everywhere she's covered in both herself and Rio, and so a bath is probably wise.</p><p>After some gentle coaxing, she manages to get Rio to the bathroom, brings the bag from the floor with her that has the balm she likes to apply after rope play. They sit on the edge of the bath, rope still around their neck and touching it lightly.</p><p>"I'll take it off now, it's okay. I just didn't want to remove it too soon and shock you," Agatha explains as the water fills the tub.</p><p>Rio's hand curls around the knot, "If I had a proper collar, I wouldn't have to take it off now."</p><p>Agatha's heart clenches and she focuses on the bath, even though there's nothing left to do but watch the water rise. She can't bear to tell them that she <em>can't</em> get them a collar, no matter how much she wants to.</p><p>Her hand joins Rio's over the knot, "Bath's ready."</p><p>She tries to ignore the look of disappointment Rio can't hide when she undoes the tie. Their hand flies up to hold their throat when it's gone and they take in a deep breath before they let Agatha guide them into the bath. Usually, Rio sits behind Agatha, takes care of <em>her,</em> but she wants to do the same for them this time. The lack of orgasm keeps them in subspace for a lot longer.</p><p>They don't mention the collar anymore after that, lets Agatha wash their hair if they're allowed to shuffle around to do the same, washes her body with the promise that Agatha can wash them in turn. Rio stays quiet and Agatha doesn't push for them to talk, knows they need a moment of things not being in any way overstimulating to come down after submission.</p><p>Her hands graze the edges of their tape and she sees the way it's peeled away from their skin a little now that she has them in front of her—their chest not as flat as it usually is because of it.</p><p>"That, uh—" Rio tilts their head to see where she's touching, "That happens when I get sweaty. I should've changed it before we came, but I didn't get chance."</p><p>"We could maybe see if you can do something where you don't have to take your shirt off tomorrow."</p><p>Rio, soaking off the subspace that had remained, brings a wet, soapy hand to Agatha's face, cups her chin just enough to hold but not enough to drench her, "No one knows you're a big softie."</p><p>"I am <em>not."</em></p><p>"You <em>are,"</em> Rio smiles, gathers bubbles in their hand and blows them at Agatha's face who bats them away while trying to keep a glare on her face, "Your heart is like, big enough to hold the world in it, I think."</p><p>Agatha doesn't think it's worth mentioning that she's only like this with them, embarrassed enough already that they seem to know it anyway. So, she just grunts and rolls her eyes.</p><p>"I thought ahead. I brought a roll of tape with me," They say, moving their hands through the water and creating a mini current, "I can take it off later and I can re-tape in the morning. Don't worry."</p><p>"I can help," Agatha says, sudden and without thinking, then feels stupid for it; Rio has been taping for years—she remembers when they came to her when they were thinking about trying it, the way they downplayed it like it hadn't mattered, "If you want."</p><p>Agatha finds her own hands matching the current of the water Rio is making, moving in tandem.</p><p>"You'd do that?"</p><p><em>I'd do anything for you.</em></p><p>"Sure," Agatha says, much safer, "What should I do?"</p><p>"I have oil in my toiletry bag," They say and Agatha doesn't wait to haul herself out of the water to get it.</p><p>Agatha pops the cap of the oil open and encourages Rio to lean back a little to she can pour the oil directly on the tape.</p><p>"You remember?" Rio asks when Agatha massages the oil into their chest.</p><p>Of course she does. They'd done plenty of research together when Rio first showed interest in taping rather than wearing a binder like they had for years—since school. Rio said it was less daunting not doing it alone—doing it with <em>Agatha,</em> specifically. And Agatha had kept on looking up how to apply the tape, how to remove it safely, for weeks after Rio first bought it, just in case they needed any help.</p><p>"Good job I do. Imagine if you broke both your arms," Agatha looks up at them through her lashes with a smile, "Who would tape your chest then?"</p><p>"Oh," Rio laughs, relaxes into the feeling of Agatha touching them. She keeps at it a little longer than probably necessary, but she likes touching them, "That doesn't sound at all like a threat."</p><p>Agatha just shrugs and then dips her hands back into the bath to get the oil off them.</p><p>"Does it hurt?" She says when they start to slowly peel the tape off.</p><p>"Not with the oil," They say, "And not when it starts to peel off by itself. It's like, past being ready now, really."</p><p>It occurs to Agatha once one side is done that she's never seen their chest without the tape and her eyes dart around the bathroom. The extractor fan looks interesting enough to hold her attention.</p><p>"Have you never seen breasts before, Agatha?"</p><p>When Agatha's eyes snap back to Rio, their tongue is pushed into their cheek. She's less than amused to admit that she finds the move attractive. Even less amused to reckon with the thought that maybe she <em>always</em> has.</p><p>"I—" She splutters, feels very much like the tide has changed because how is <em>Rio</em> suddenly the one making fun of <em>her?</em></p><p>"You're so easily wound up." Rio sounds giddy.</p><p>Whatever. She rolls her eyes, "I'm trying to be respectful."</p><p>"You just had me kneeling on the floor, calling me your pet," Agatha squirms at the reminder—might have to squeeze another orgasm out before bed, "I think you're allowed to look at my bare chest." And then a beat where Rio's face changes, grows serious, "Thank you."</p><p>Agatha nods, then narrowly avoids swallowing her own tongue when the other side of tape comes off as she asks, "Can I wash you?"</p><p>She's happy to get Rio settled back in front of her after they happily hum their agreement, gets to wrap her arms around them as she cleans them and they help her by picking at bits of stubborn adhesive.</p><p>"I'd do this even if we were just friends," Agatha says, thinks to elaborate that she means <em>just</em> the tape part, not the holding their naked body to <em>her</em> naked body in the bath, but she just thinks she might look some sort of guilty.</p><p>Rio sighs, content, "I know you would."</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stirs in the night.</p><p><em>I know you would.</em></p><p>Rio's sigh. Content?</p><p>She replays it in her mind.</p><p><em>I know you would, Rio sighs, resigned.</em></p><p>She hates that her brain makes sense of it more this way.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>The day after spending the night with Rio is usually spent thinking about them—today is no different in that regard. What <em>is</em> different is that she usually floats around with whichever headspace had gripped her that night still having the gentlest of holds over her.</p><p>Agatha thinks about sex probably more than the average person, doesn't see anything wrong with that, and after a night like last night she'd probably still be there in the back of her mind. She'd be thinking of how Rio was so <em>good</em> for her, how, in an ideal world, she'd wrap a collar around their pretty neck and keep them to herself.</p><p>Today is different.</p><p>She zones out during today's massage thinking not about pinning Rio down and using them; she's not even thinking about the flip side—Rio tying <em>her</em> up and having their way with her.</p><p>Instead, her mind is playing a custom movie style montage of what her life <em>could</em> look like—Rio coming home to her after a long day, <em>her boyfriend,</em> her mind provides. Agatha feels her cheeks heat up from the mere thought of them greeting her with a kiss and calling her, 'my love'.</p><p>And what better time to be given this image than when she has Rio next to her, and a masseuse working on her now flushed face.</p><p>(This now marks the second time she's been asked if she's getting too hot, which doesn't at all add to any embarrassment she might have had. Which she does not.)</p><p>Agatha can't even shake the feeling now—there's a change happening between them. Something different to even the change when they started sleeping together, and Agatha <em>needs</em> it to stop, needs to be taken out of her head so she can <em>think</em> straight for a minute.</p><p>She needs to go back to the beginning of all this when she wasn't second guessing herself, when she didn't know she was in <em>love.</em></p><p>She's just not brave enough to be honest.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Early November is a strange time for the hotel business, the server who had dropped off their drinks had been telling Rio—always the more personable of the two, always the more <em>interested</em> in the people outside of their two person bubble.</p><p>It's a little too cold for people to want to travel, a little too close to the holiday season to warrant the travel and the expense. A little too <em>unromantic.</em></p><p><em>("Oh," Rio had laughed, keeping up the pretense easy, "Romance comes easy. I could never let the weather or the time of year stop me."</em></p><p><em>Agatha wondered if this was true—if Rio would bring her flowers year round, would buy her chocolates, save her favorites for her birthday still—a special occasion, just at will.</em></p><p><em>Just like how she knew she'd get them their favorites—that cheese from the city, a pin badge from that independent queer shop where the boy with too much eyeliner takes up too much of their day, she knows they would.)</em></p><p>All that to say the hotel isn't very busy right now.</p><p>There were a few couples, though much older than they are and probably with no young children to look after, but they've since abandoned the indoor pool Agatha is sat at the edge of.</p><p>She's been content watching Rio swim laps with a martini on the edge next to her <em>(—"I won't smash it or drop it in the pool, I promise,")</em>, and occasionally splashing them with water to throw them off their game every now and then.</p><p>"Hey," Rio says, a little breathless, looks around before coming to rest their forearms on Agatha's thighs, keeps themself afloat.</p><p>"Hi," Agatha says back like a nervous schoolgirl, even though she was never like this when she was <em>in</em> school, not even around Rio. She thinks she remembers being extra mean to them when they joined her school, doesn't know how they became friends, really.</p><p>"Remember that first time you came on vacation with us?"</p><p>By <em>'us'</em> she gathers Rio means their family. <em>Her</em> family?</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Agatha was eighteen and her mother no longer had any <em>legal</em> hold on her. She hadn't thought Rio's parents were that fond of her, even after spending so many nights, so many dinners at their house over the years, until they presented her with a plane ticket and a free vacation.</p><p>Rio smiles, eyes not quite focused on Agatha like they're back there, "You kept throwing things into the pool for me to dive for. I thought you weren't having a good time."</p><p>"I always have the best time with you," Agatha says, too relaxed after her day and her second martini, "That was when you taught me how to swim."</p><p>Rio rests their cheek against Agatha's thigh for a moment, "I think my dad did most of the teaching."</p><p><em>"I</em> think you're downplaying how much of an active role you played in making sure I didn't drown in your nana's pool."</p><p>"Well, that wasn't about you," Rio says through a smile Agatha can feel against her skin, "I don't think nana would have held on those extra years if you'd died in front of her."</p><p>Agatha sucks on her teeth, pats Rio's cheek a couple of times, "So selfless."</p><p>Rio grins, doesn't say anything else before they're pushing off from the edge to start up another lap. Agatha wonders if it'll be possible to go back to that—what they were before, wonders if that's what Rio is thinking about too, if they're braver than she is to admit it.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Treacle.</p><p>That's the only possible way Agatha can describe her mind right now.</p><p>She let Rio take their time with her tonight, tying a pretty diamond harness around her chest—just for aesthetic purposes for once, had kept Agatha's arms free, allowing her to hold their face to her tits as she sat on her lap, two fingers inside her as she was brought to her first orgasm of the night.</p><p>It's an insatiable sort of night—one where Agatha can't see the end to her greed. Just wants to take, and take, and <em>take—</em></p><p>Agatha wasn't allowed her second orgasm until she was bent over and Rio had made a new tie keeping her ankles bound to her thighs. She had dug her face into her forearm kept herself mostly quiet that way as Rio ate her out from behind—her voice muffled for every part except for when Rio had caught her unguarded, reached up to press the pad of their thumb to the ring of her ass.</p><p>Here, on her way to a third—the first two feeling like nothing but starters—is where Agatha would describe her brain this way—treacle. Maybe even a sponge drenched in treacle is more apt. She doesn't have the capacity to say for sure.</p><p>A hand gets fisted in her hair, her head encouraged up—rough, "Look at yourself," Rio's voice is low and Agatha can't help but comply, blink back into her eyes instead of the picture inside her mind. She hadn't even realized they had her facing the mirror until this moment now, "I know you like seeing how I take you."</p><p>Agatha barely even recognizes herself—doesn't remember the last time she looked like this during sex. Doesn't remember the last time anyone else made her feel this way.</p><p>And really, with the way she hasn't trusted anyone but Rio to dom her in years, there maybe wasn't <em>ever</em> a time she's felt like this before them.</p><p>It seems that's a running theme with everything in her life—everything <em>before</em> Rio can't even begin to compare with anything <em>during</em> Rio, <em>after</em> Rio.</p><p>Her legs tense against their bonds and she's glad to have her arms free to stretch out into the sheets in front of her when finally, <em>finally</em> Rio presses their hips forward, fits the head of their cock to her dripping cunt.</p><p>Agatha's head drops down on instinct, but Rio isn't having it, "Come on, baby. Don't you wanna see how blissed out you get when you get me inside?" They push forward, a tease, just the head of the strap but even that's a lot when it's one of their bigger ones. "You look almost drunk on it."</p><p>She feels it, honestly.</p><p><em>"Rio,"</em> She mewls, dissatisfied, <em>"Please."</em></p><p>Rio isn't cruel enough to deny her for long, begins that delicious push that has Agatha stretching out around them.</p><p>They're so <em>thick—</em>only adds to the heaviness of her brain.</p><p>"Feel good?" They ask, hips pressed to her ass.</p><p><em>"Amazing—"</em> She'd be embarrassed to slur if she wasn't two orgasms deep and in the warm embrace of willing subspace already.</p><p>Rio's palm flattens against her spine, just below where the harness ends, "My good girl."</p><p>Agatha cries out as Rio snaps their hips against hers, starts building a rhythm, filthy-sounding with how wet she is.</p><p>"Keep watching us."</p><p>Agatha can't bear not to listen to them, manages to hold her own chin up enough to see them together.</p><p><em>They look good together.</em></p><p>Agatha won't tell them that. Idly, she wonders if Rio had the same thought last night when they were on their knees for her.</p><p>She feels her orgasm building as she watches them fuck her, the way they look in control, like Agatha's needs could never be too much, <em>"Fuck,</em> Rio."</p><p>"That's it," Rio murmurs, "Let me hear you."</p><p>Their name is the only thing she remembers how to say, lets them have it—their name, their scent, their voice fills the air and she is <em>surrounded</em> by them, and still it doesn't feel like enough.</p><p>"Please," She begs, needs this third orgasm, needs Rio deep inside her to even begin to satiate the burning hunger, "Please, Rio, <em>f-fuck</em>, 'm close—"</p><p>Rio's eyes lock onto her own in the mirror, and she thinks maybe she's bared enough for them to see everything she wants from this because that hand moves from her spine, glides up her back, curls around her shoulder and wraps around her throat. Their pace doesn't falter, and the even further slowing of her brain as Rio squeezes the sides of her throat, has her only able to focus on what she can <em>see</em> and <em>feel.</em></p><p>"Want you to come," Rio's eyes burn into her own, and she has to look away, drops her gaze to their strong forearm in the reflection as they choke her the way she likes. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em> "No, look at yourself."</p><p>Agatha hears a low rumble of approval as she meets her own gaze, and <em>fuck,</em> she looks <em>so</em> good like this, feels herself clench around Rio as her inevitable third orgasm hits, as Rio loosens their hold on her throat and she gasps in air.</p><p><em>God,</em> Rio knows her body so well. They know exactly how to give her what she wants, even when she doesn't know it herself sometimes—too quick in her greed.</p><p><em>"Another—"</em> Agatha begs, has barely even come down, is still shuddering through it, "I need, I need—"</p><p>Agatha trails off, can't get her brain to work enough to figure out <em>what</em> she needs, just that she—</p><p>"I know, sweetheart," Rio leans over her and she blearily makes out the sight of them pressing a kiss to her shoulder, feels it too—somehow the vision and reality feel like two different things—feels like she's experiencing everything twofold, and it's admittedly a lot, "You need more, don't you?"</p><p>"Yeah—" Agatha agrees, mindless, though she doesn't know what Rio's intention is.</p><p>"My greedy girl. Always needing more."</p><p>It's exceptionally evil, Agatha feels, to say something like that while they're emptying her of their cock. She whines, pushes back, forehead dropping to the sheets, upset. But Rio still doesn't fill her back up again.</p><p>"Where're you going?" She hears herself whimper when she can no longer feel any part of Rio on her. Agatha forces her head up enough to look in the mirror so she can see them. She doesn't really have it in her to feel any shame when she sees they're still right next to her, and they put a comforting hand on her ankle when they hear her as they rifle through her bag, now on the bed.</p><p>Agatha's eyebrows furrow and she twists as much as she can to work out what they're doing.</p><p>Her stomach clenches to see them essentially jacking themself off, lubing their cock up like her come hadn't been enough.</p><p>"The hell do you need lube for?"</p><p>Rio kneels back behind her, encourages her face back to the mirror, and—both curious and already feeling somewhat touch-starved, Agatha lets them. Heat coils in the pit of her stomach at the feeling of Rio spreading her open, hands solid on her ass; she burns hotter and hotter, eyes growing wide as she focuses on Rio's face, watches them gather spit in their mouth, doesn't have time even to moan her encouragement before she feels their spit hit her, starts it's slow drip in the same way her brain has been melting all evening.</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em></p><p>"I'll give you everything you want, baby."</p><p><em>Baby, baby baby—</em></p><p>She focuses on that as Rio presses a single wet finger to her hole. Agatha's eyes slam shut and she pushes back into the touch.</p><p>"See?" Rio's voice is gently smug, "I know what you need." They press inside her, bit by bit, doesn't stop until she's taken it all the way in.</p><p><em>"M—"</em></p><p>"More?" Rio gets there first, pulls back to line up a second finger. They usually work her up a little more, keep her wanting a little longer while they make sure she can take it. Today, they just give her exactly what she wants—which is simply as much of Rio as possible.</p><p>It feels good—so, <em>so</em> good but she still can't help her need to come again. And two fingers buried inside her ass is a lot more than those same fingers in her cunt but Agatha feels the emptiness all the same.</p><p><em>"Rio,</em> please don't tease," She begs, tries to appeal to them even though she <em>knows</em> they're not teasing, not really, "I need you to fill me up, I need to be <em>full—"</em></p><p>Rio soothes, <em>okay, okay</em> as they pull their fingers out. It takes everything in Agatha not to moan her disappointment, knows Rio wants to be inside her this way as much as she wants it.</p><p>She hears the squirt of lube again and soon, feels Rio's cock pressing against her. It's bigger than she'd usually take, she realizes when she gets the head inside, has to take a few deep breaths to calm down. Rio reaches around, presses a hand to the patch of skin available through the central diamond in the rope, right over her heart and it does what they need it to. This probably hadn't been their original thought for the night—just happy to go wherever Agatha's hunger leads them.</p><p>Rio is willing to do whatever she wants, she hears a voice that sounds like her own say, and still she is unsatisfied. Agatha will never be happy with what anyone is willing to give—always needs more, and more eventually. It is better not to want from someone so much that she opens up to take everything from them; this has been her mistake with Rio from the start.</p><p>She does manage to take them all the way inside, body accommodating like she knew it would. And when their hips start up a grind, not quite pulling out to thrust, just keeping her full, her toes curl and her eyes roll back at the delicious friction.</p><p>Agatha doesn't realize until she's drooling into the sheets that she'd let her head drop. She tries to push herself back up but her body doesn't seem to be working with her, can barely feel any parts of her body that Rio isn't touching, exists solely for pleasure.</p><p>The fingers that hadn't been inside her snake around to hold her stomach, <em>"Gorgeous,"</em> Rio whispers into her back, and then trail down to press light into her clit.</p><p>"Oh, <em>fuck—"</em> Agatha needs it, already feels like she's gone too long without an orgasm, "Need it, <em>need it—"</em></p><p>"You can have it," Rio's hips press her into the mattress, keep her there as they rock into her ass, makes Agatha feel hemmed in but not trapped. They gather come from her cunt, drags it up to her clit in its abundance, "Don't hold back, I want you to come."</p><p>That's all Agatha needs for another orgasm to rip through her, clenches the sheets between her teeth as she comes.</p><p>For a few moments—minutes, maybe—she just lies with them buried all the way inside, unmoving, and she feels <em>good,</em> satisfied for now.</p><p>But, like expected, like with everything, it doesn't last.</p><p>"Rio," She mumbles, mostly inaudible even to herself with the sheets still on her tongue. Agatha turns her head to the side, her own spit slides against her cheek, "Rio, I need <em>more."</em></p><p>She hears their breath hitch, "You're sure?"</p><p>"I just," Her mouth is cotton, "I feel so empty."</p><p>And she does. Her cunt clenches around nothing, she misses the ache in her jaw after they fill her mouth. Even her chest <em>gapes.</em> So yes, she's sure. She just doesn't know—</p><p>"Come here," Rio says, helps haul her up, slow with the strap still buried in her ass, and Agatha goes willingly, manages to be moved up onto her knees so long as she can lean back against Rio's solid body.</p><p>Rio feels so much <em>bigger</em> inside her this way, and her breaths come short as they wait for her to settle.</p><p>"Okay?"</p><p>She nods, back of her head moving against their shoulder, "Good."</p><p>Agatha is vaguely aware of Rio reaching across the bed for something, but she's happy enough to slide her eyes shut and wait for it, knows they can't go anywhere like this.</p><p>"Color?" Rio asks, voice pillowy and comforting.</p><p>Agatha inhales sharp—opening her eyes feels harder than anything right now. She blinks down to see Rio holding the second strap—the one she brought because it was the one they usually used for ass play. She shifts, glad to have the bigger one inside her right now, doesn't think she'd be half as satisfied with this one.</p><p><em>Color. Color?</em></p><p>"We don't have to," Rio says, as if Agatha's brain is spinning hard enough to know what they're talking about, "I just thought it'd help you feel full."</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>"Green," She gasps, hips rocking, "Please, I want it."</p><p>"Yeah?" Rio brings it to her cunt, grinds it into her, getting it wet and bumping it up into her clit every time, "You want me in your cunt too?"</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> Agatha hisses, "Fuck me. Please, fill me."</p><p>Rio angles the toy against her entrance, and she can feel herself clenching, like her body is trying to draw it inside. They press a hot kiss to the side of her neck, "Take a breath for me, baby."</p><p>Agatha does as told, unthinking.</p><p>Rio goes slower than Agatha probably would in her impatience, but they're right to, probably. It's smaller than anything she's taken in her cunt in a long time but it feels <em>so</em> much bigger with Rio's cock already deep inside her ass.</p><p>Her arm flies up to wrap around the back of Rio's neck—feels like if she doesn't hold on tight then she might float away from her body.</p><p>"You're doing so good, baby," Agatha's mind latches onto their voice—sounds much stronger than she does right now and so she has no reason not to believe them, "Just keep breathing for me."</p><p>Rio keeps her still—their cock buried deep inside her and unmoving as they thrust the new toy inside her bit by bit, keeps her fucked <em>and</em> full at the same time. Agatha can't think, can't breathe, can't do anything but cry out as Rio fucks her.</p><p><em>Full,</em> she thinks, and her mind trills happily.</p><p>She feels pleasure zip up her spine every time Rio pushes inside and she is completely filled, and she could come like this—of course she could, but—</p><p>Agatha's spare hand finds her own clit and she feels a tear drip down her cheek from nothing but pleasure. She can't form words anymore, just syllables that sound vaguely like Rio's name, and she's gonna <em>come—</em></p><p>The movements on her clit are far from perfect; she doesn't seem capable of anything but two fingers flatly rubbing, but still, it only takes Rio filling her up, holding her close, her fingers catching her clit at just the right angle to set her veins alight as she comes.</p><p>Agatha thinks as she blinks back into existence that maybe she blacked out for a moment there. Her breathing comes heavy and Rio is holding her close, likely so that she doesn't fall.</p><p>Her fingers are soaked, her thighs feel sticky with her own release.</p><p>"Good?" Rio asks, voice sounding loud now in the wake of Agatha's cries.</p><p>Agatha's tongue is heavy, "Mhm."</p><p>Her throat sounds dry.</p><p>She is still full, she doesn't think she's ever had sex this good, doesn't think she's ever felt so much <em>pleasure.</em> And even now, her chest still <em>aches,</em> and she doesn't feel like any amount of Rio she's had tonight compares to how much of them she wants.</p><p>Her stomach turns with her greed.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio stayed inside of her for some time, aware not to take what she's been begging for so quickly. The rope has been removed and Agatha finds herself able to form words now enough to ask Rio, now dressed in nothing but loose boxers, for water.</p><p>It is easier now with her brain still in that floaty state, and with Rio out of her eye line to say what she is afraid of.</p><p>"Baby," Agatha says, throat rough, mouth tacky—just to feel the word on her tongue one last time. <em>"Baby,"</em> She says it again—selfish—to commit the shape of it to memory.</p><p>Agatha can hear Rio swallow from somewhere behind her but they don't answer.</p><p>She knows it's probably going to hurt more doing it like this, but she knows she isn't brave enough otherwise, and she just can't keep going like this—because eventually she will take too much of Rio and she will ruin them. There's something about the comfort and safety of subspace that has her barrelling forward, "I think we need to start being honest."</p><p>"Honest?" Rio sounds winded, like Agatha just punched them. They come back into her view and her stomach drops but the damage is done.</p><p>Even through it, Rio drops next to her on the bed so she can have a drink.</p><p>"We both know this can't go anywhere and it's <em>still</em> getting too much," She says, watches as Rio draws back, as their hands wrap around themself, "It's too much, Rio. And we said from the start when it's time to stop, we stop. I think we need to go back to being friends. Just friends."</p><p>For a moment, she thinks Rio will say <em>no,</em> will tell her everything she wants to hear—</p><p>"Okay."</p><p><em>Right.</em></p><p>She doesn't know why that hurts more. She didn't want to fight with them about this. Agatha can imagine how it would be—a massive argument and no room left for their friendship to continue because <em>fuck,</em> it's all so messy and they <em>hate</em> each other for it, but—</p><p>Rio's hands are in fists and they bring one to cover their mouth, look a little like they might actually be sick.</p><p>"Baby," She says, habit.</p><p>Rio makes a pained noise and shakes their head. They look away from her and over to the pillows at the other end of the bed.</p><p>Oh god. She hadn't really thought about the consequences of breaking up with—breaking things <em>off</em> with Rio when she still has her come on her thighs, indents of rope in her skin, and her body hasn't gotten used to being empty again. She definitely hadn't thought about the consequences of doing this <em>here</em> when they can't get away from one another and Rio still has to drive them home.</p><p>"We can leave now," She says, hand reaching for Rio but deciding better of it, "If that's easier?"</p><p>"No," Rio shakes their head, turns to her with a grimace shaped smile on their lips—unnoticeable, she thinks, to anyone but her. "It doesn't have to be hard. That's why we said to do it like this, right?" Gone is the sick, anguished look from before, "But maybe we can save the <em>just</em> friends for tomorrow? I still need to perform aftercare."</p><p>Agatha's instinct is to say no, but she knows they're both going to feel worse in the morning if she doesn't let them.</p><p>"Fine. But I want a shower first."</p><p>Agatha tries to stand but her legs are shaky. Rio doesn't think twice before steadying her. They <em>do</em> think twice about their hand placement though—move their grip from her hips to her back. She knows she's done the right thing in the long run, but it's horrible to have Rio guide her to the bathroom without their wandering hands, without eyes that wander down her body. They ask if they can touch her to help her climb into the bathtub once they get the shower running, and they don't join her.</p><p>"I'll be right outside, okay?"</p><p>The shower makes her feel sick and cold and empty no matter how hot she runs the water.</p><p>She's in there for longer than she usually likes, fingers turning wrinkly. When she comes back into the bedroom, Rio is sitting cross legged on the bed, waiting for her. They scramble up when they see her, fit an old t-shirt into her hands. "Just—I don't know if you have anything to sleep in."</p><p>Oh. Agatha hadn't thought about that either, notices how Rio is wearing a t-shirt as well as their boxers now too.</p><p>It smells like Rio. For as much as Rio had said to wait until tomorrow for them to go back to being friends, she knows she can't sleep with them curled around her spine tonight. Agatha doesn't tell them she likes how it smells, but she holds it to her face as they rub balm into her skin before she's allowed to put it on.</p><p>And when she rolls under the sheets, feels the warmth of Rio's body next to her, but can't have it for herself, she brings the neck of the shirt up to her nose so she can pretend.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It must be something to do with Rio's stupid Subaru—maybe it's the heavy downpour of rain battering the roof, or maybe it's just plain cursed or something, because no matter how exhausted she is, she still can't fall asleep in this car.</p><p>She does pretend to be after Rio tries to talk to her, though.</p><p>Agatha can lie to Rio and say she's ready to be just friends again—that this was easy because there were never any feelings there, but she can't lie to herself any longer about what this has been.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has sort of been itching to get out of this car since she got in it, but even when Rio pulls up onto the sidewalk in front of her drive, she doesn't throw herself out of the door like she'd fantasized about doing for at least half the journey.</p><p>Leaving means it's over, she guesses. <em>Really</em> over.</p><p>"Maybe we could do something this week?" Rio sounds desperate and their eyes are glassy when she pulls up the courage to look their way, "Even just stay in and order a pizza or something?"</p><p>Agatha wants to say no. She can't imagine being alone in her house with Rio and <em>not</em> having sex right now. She can't say that to her best friend though.</p><p>"Sure. Yeah, whatever." And then, just to make sure she sounds casual about the whole thing, the past few months, the future, Agatha shrugs, "It's been fun."</p><p>"Yeah," Rio sounds about as wrung out as Agatha actually feels, "It's been fun."</p><p>She takes this as her awkward cue to leave, but she stays rooted to the seat with her fingers on the handle.</p><p><em>Honest,</em> Agatha had said last night, <em>we need to be honest.</em> Pretending this meant nothing isn't being honest.</p><p>Agatha slumps back in her seat, side eyes Rio for any sign she shouldn't do this. Their face looks as open as it always does.</p><p>"I think I fell in love with you when we started having sex."</p><p>Rio's face hardly changes, though their jaw clenches and unclenches. Eventually, after what seems like forever, they nod like this isn't new information. Maybe it isn't—maybe they've known for a while that she'd fallen in love with them and didn't know how to break things off because of it. Rio has always, <em>always</em> been careful with her heart.</p><p>Agatha feels sick at the thought, continues, "I know we're not going to be anything more than that. I think it's the," Agatha waves a hand between them with an eyeroll like <em>it's silly,</em> "proximity or whatever, but I'll get over it after a while of not doing… <em>this.</em> A relationship isn't exactly in the cards, I mean, we both know that, right?"</p><p><em>Right?</em></p><p>Fuck, she sounds hysterical—everything she's never wanted to be in love. But then again, she never thought falling in love was something she was even capable of—unloving mother that she had to learn from.</p><p>"Yeah, I—" Rio blinks at her like they want to look away from her, eyes shifting but ultimately resting on her face, "It's okay. I know that's not what you—"</p><p>"I'm just," Agatha cuts them off, "I'm no good for a relationship. I'm good for sex. You <em>definitely</em> know <em>that.</em> I'm not… I'm not someone people fall in love with anyway, I know that."</p><p><em>You're not going to fall in love with me, I know that.</em></p><p>This is when Rio finally looks away, stares into their lap, brow heavy. Agatha doesn't really want to stick around for Rio's pity, swings open the car door, narrowly avoids hitting one of her neighbors with it, "I'll see you later, yeah?"</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Fifteen minutes later and Agatha has finally made it upstairs.</p><p>The first few minutes after she shut the door were spent pressed <em>against</em> the door as she sobbed into her hands.</p><p>Then, she collected herself for long enough to take in her hallway through blurry eyes. And then she sobbed again because there isn't an inch of this house that Rio hasn't touched.</p><p>It's pathetic, she knows, but it's out of her system—the first step to healing.</p><p>Maybe. Whatever, she never went to therapy.</p><p>She wants to change into nothing but a robe and <em>rot</em> in her bed with Scratchy—after she changes the sheets that still must smell like them—but she notices Rio's car still outside her house. They're just sitting, hands on the wheel and staring, as far as she can tell.</p><p>Strange. But ultimately, if that's how they wanna process their emotions, it's a free country.</p><p>So, Agatha <em>does</em> change into a silky robe, and because she's not quite that sad yet, slips under a blanket but still <em>on top</em> of her bed with a bag of chocolate straight from the fridge—tries not to cry over Rio not being here to call her a psychopath for it, but not before checking for Rio's car again.</p><p>Still there.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>This is getting ridiculous.</p><p>Agatha feels like a comic villain the way she's been rolling out of bed every five minutes to peer over her window ledge at Rio, head barely visible in case they decide to look up and catch her spying.</p><p>It's been another half hour and—</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio's car is still there but Rio is not.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flicks the tv on, settles down to watch some shitty reality show where the love lives of these people are somehow more promising than her own.</p><p>She's just glad she has something to occupy her eyes with other than crying.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>"I'm coming!" Agatha shouts after whoever is <em>pounding</em> on her door decides to knock again only seconds after the first time.</p><p>No, she scolds herself, she's deciding to be honest now—she's already maybe ruined her life, it can't get much worse. It was the fourth time of knocking.</p><p>She flings her front door open, handle slamming against the wall and caving in the dent that had been covered years ago.</p><p>"I'll fix that later."</p><p><em>Rio.</em></p><p>She just <em>stares</em> at them. Her inner monologuing can only take her so far trying to turn her life into something of a comedy.</p><p>"Rio," She breathes, wraps her robe tighter around herself, rain coming down heavy and getting her bare feet wet even from standing inside, "You look like you've been drowned. What are you doing here?"</p><p>They hold up a takeout menu from <em>Herb's Pizzeria.</em></p><p>Agatha sighs, "I know we said this week, but that doesn't really mean <em>today."</em></p><p>"What?" Rio looks at the menu in their hand, blinks like they don't know how it got there, "Oh—no." They wave around the menu, "This isn't—well, it is. But, can I just—" They cut themself off with a wince, glance down at the menu and then back up to Agatha, "I need to just… We need everything out in the open. Honesty, like you said. And I need to not forget anything."</p><p>They look down at the menu again and Agatha follows their gaze. She sees now that it's been scribbled all over to the point that it's barely legible. She's so distracted trying to read it that she forgets to say anything.</p><p>"I know we broke up, but—"</p><p>"We didn't break up."</p><p>"W-what?"</p><p>It breaks Agatha's heart to say it, "We'd have to be together to break up."</p><p>"Right. Yeah. No, I know that," Rio looks down al their scribbled on menu like they're losing track of their thoughts, "I know we weren't <em>together</em> and I know it's done, and that it was getting too much—"</p><p>"Gee, thanks," Agatha scoffs, crosses her arms over her chest, "Did you actually have anything to say or did you just wanna make me relive that whole thing, because this is making me feel just <em>great."</em></p><p>She watches as Rio takes in a deep breath, takes hold of the menu in both hands, squints at the now soggy page, "You said you're not someone people fall in love with. I couldn't let you think that. And you've been honest with me, but I haven't been honest with you."</p><p>"Rio, what?"</p><p>"Agatha, I'm in love with you." Rio rushes out, eyes wide and looking at <em>her</em> and not the stupid pizza menu that Rio gives up on and shoves in their jacket pocket.</p><p>Agatha wheezes out what might be a laugh, "No, you're not."</p><p>Rio laughs, wet like this is absurd, takes a step closer to Agatha, ducking their head over the slight overhang to get out of the rain, "Yes I am. I've been in love with you since I met you."</p><p>The air rushes out of Agatha's lungs.</p><p>"I don't need you to lie to me to make me feel better," She says, though she doesn't even believe that herself. She knows how Rio looks when they lie. She changes course, "I wasn't even nice to you when we first met. Didn't I take your lunch money?"</p><p>"My whole lunch, actually," Rio says, smiles like this is a fond memory. Agatha doesn't remember it quite as well, "I thought you were beautiful."</p><p>It's ridiculous that this makes Agatha blush after all of the other things Rio has said to her over these past few months. "I was ugly in the way all teenagers are. And I didn't have a hair care routine," She adds the last part on for good measure.</p><p>"And I thought you were beautiful," Rio's shoulders sag like they have no air left in their lungs, "You're even more beautiful now, especially now that I <em>know</em> you."</p><p>Agatha just stands and blinks at them for a moment, before swiftly pulling them inside, presses her inner wrist to their forehead, tries not to think about how close they are, "How long have you been out in the rain? Do you have a fever?"</p><p>"No," Rio shuts the door behind them and suddenly it feels like there's no air in her house, "No, Agatha. I need you to listen to me and I need you to believe me. I'm in love with you. I didn't want to tell you because I thought it would ruin us, but I can't stand the thought of you thinking I couldn't be in love with you.</p><p>"I have <em>always</em> loved you. I think I fall more and more in love with you every day, and I know a relationship isn't what you want. I've known that for a long time and I've been okay with that because I was selfish and it was okay because it just meant I couldn't lose you to somebody else."</p><p>Rio holds their palms up like they have nothing else to give, "I replayed that conversation in the car over and over to myself in my head and I just… I wanted to make sure breaking up—breaking things <em>off</em> was what you wanted. Because, even though it goes against everything I've thought, it sounded like you wanted this."</p><p>"What?" Agatha rasps, "Like I want to be with you?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Rio's voice is small and Agatha can't stop the tears from fucking welling in her eyes, "We both know I can't want it. I've been content with what we've had. I've known this whole time this would never be anything more."</p><p><em>"Baby,"</em> Agatha can't help the choked wet sound coming from the back of her throat, "I am going to be in love with you no matter what. So, do you <em>want</em> this?"</p><p>"I—I'm not in a position to make a long term relationship work, Rio. I'll let you down."</p><p>Rio takes hold of both her hands, slow and gentle like they're approaching a wild animal, "We've been best friends for fifteen years and you've never once let me down. I've never thought being your friend was a mistake. I will walk away right now and we can forget about all of this, we can go back to just being friends if that's what you want. But if you're only saying that because you don't think it can work then, respectfully, I disagree."</p><p>"Friendship is different to a relationship," Agatha says, can't wipe away the tear that slips down her cheek because she doesn't want to let go of Rio's hands, "And love doesn't make a relationship."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Why not?" Rio says again, adamant, simple.</p><p><em>Why not?</em></p><p>"What would change if we started dating?" Agatha thinks this is the most confident she's ever seen Rio look about <em>anything,</em> "Because I've thought about it and I can't see how it would change much other than getting to hold your hand in public."</p><p>The illusion that Agatha had been having the same thought because she just doesn't know enough about relationships is instantly shattered.</p><p>"You could leave me if things get hard," She says, because it's really the only true thing she's ever worried about, and now she has another fear to add to that list, "You might fall out of love with me."</p><p>"Agatha," They squeeze her hands and then they smile a little, "If I'd wanted to leave you, it would have been when your mom put a ban on you <em>being friends with the dyke</em> and we had to come up with the most elaborate plans just to see each other. Things have <em>been</em> hard. I think I'll be in love with you forever, no matter what."</p><p><em>"Rio,"</em> She breathes but no other words join.</p><p>"Tell me you don't want to be with me."</p><p>And in the interest of finally being honest, Agatha finds she can't tell them that. She lets go of their hands only to wrap her arms around Rio's neck, pulling them in close. She waits, suspended in the moment before everything changes for a second time, and Rio just waits for her to make her decision, to close the distance between them and kiss them.</p><p>It's unlike any of their kisses before, and Agatha has been trying to keep her distance so much that she's been denying herself this. She had almost forgotten what it was like.</p><p>She sinks into the softness of their lips, their unhurried hands holding her close.</p><p>This kiss, the first kiss she's had with someone she is in love with, someone who she <em>knows</em> loves her back, is unparalleled to anything else. It's like all of the important colors burst behind her eyes and everything before this moment becomes a dull, irrelevant hum.</p><p>"Just," Rio pulls back enough to say that one word and then they sigh like being apart for more than a breath is painful, presses their lips back against Agatha's for a moment, "So we're on the same page," They say, hands coming to hold Agatha's face, look her dead in the eyes like they don't quite believe any of this is happening, "This is you saying you want to give this a try?"</p><p>Agatha almost wants to roll her eyes at the question, but this is exactly the same kind of hand waving that got them into this situation, "Yeah."</p><p>Rio's eyes light up and they pull her in to a kiss that's mostly teeth because they can't stop smiling. Agatha still thinks it's one of the better ones she's had.</p><p>As soon as she'd relaxed into the kiss, Rio is pulling away and holding her by her shoulders to keep her at arm's length. "I wasn't supposed to kiss you," They say, panicked like they've done something terribly wrong, "I want to take you on a date."</p><p>Agatha really wants to laugh, "Was that the next step on your pizza menu?"</p><p>"Yes." Rio looks entirely too serious.</p><p>So, Agatha takes a <em>respectful</em> step back, loosens the tie on her robe <em>just</em> a little to tease them. Rio's eyes drop to her exposed skin—nothing indecent, just the barest show of cleavage, "How's next week looking for you?"</p><p>Rio gapes like a fish at the curveball, and probably the realization that they won't be able to <em>touch</em> Agatha until then either, "I was thinking more like tomorrow."</p><p>"Come on. You love it," Agatha tilts her head down, looks up at them through her lashes, "The anticipation."</p><p>"I—" Rio looks past her like their resolve might be pretty weak, and then they nod, certain, "Next week."</p><p>They're about to leave, hand twisting the door handle when they pause, quickly spin around to pull Agatha into another quick kiss, just barely a press of their lips. It ends as quick as it starts and then Rio is pulling away with a gap toothed smile that has Agatha's stomach swooping. They press a finger to their lips and shush like someone might tell them the kiss was against their self imposed rules.</p><p>And then they're out the door.</p><p>"I'll text you," She calls after them, and even in the pouring rain they amble to their car like they want to stay near her for as long as possible.</p><p>"That's what scares me." Rio throws a grin over their shoulder.</p><p>Whatever that means.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows exactly what that means. Had known <em>before</em> she'd sent Rio a picture of two brand new sets of lingerie with nothing but a question mark as the message, but it was nice to get confirmation.</p><p>Rio has been cute all week. Usually their texts are friendly <em>or</em> sexual, and it's like Agatha has paid for an upgrade package because now she's getting texts like <em>'I can't wait to see you', and 'I keep thinking about how your lips feel against mine. I don't want to feel anything else ever again'.</em></p><p>Agatha hadn't wanted to admit it at the time, but she'd made them wait in case the novelty wears off quickly. She's new to this whole <em>keeping her heart safe</em> thing, but Rio seems to have bubble wrapped it a million times.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swears she could close her eyes and she'd know the route to the museum just by each turn in the road. That's how she knew that's not where they were going, because she doesn't weigh herself down with things like <em>road signs,</em> or <em>directions.</em> She does know the museum though.</p><p>"It's museum adjacent, and I didn't want you to know where I was taking you." Rio had told her as their one and only clue.</p><p>She had been vaguely skeptical about the whole thing, had teased Rio about taking her on a bad first date, until the aquarium came into view.</p><p>"You're logged into my account and you've been binging blue planet again." Rio shrugged like it was obvious, as if anyone else would even notice these things.</p><p>Agatha <em>had</em> been really into her jellyfish these past couple of weeks. She'd been a little jealous of their lack of brains.</p><p>That's where they are right now, nearing the end of the aquarium trail—staring at the jellyfish, their fingers intertwined and Agatha resting her head on Rio's shoulder.</p><p>"Did you know that box jellyfish have eyes?" Rio, fountain of random facts, says.</p><p>Agatha hums, "I did, actually. Twenty four of them." She'd learned that one from a different documentary just days ago, but it doesn't seem worth adding that.</p><p>Rio doesn't seem upset that Agatha already knows their fact, and their eyes actually light up when they look at her, "It's funny because no one really knows how they process the images."</p><p>"Imagine having to buy twelve pairs of glasses," Agatha mutters.</p><p>"I think that would bankrupt me." Agatha snorts, squeezes Rio's fingers, and then they say, "I think you'd be a jellyfish."</p><p>Agatha doesn't really know what the correct response to that is. She looks at the jellyfish floating around and hums, "Because I sting anyone who gets too close?"</p><p>Rio laughs, "Well, there is that. Just, there are these one type of jellyfish that can reverse their life cycle, and so they're sort of immortal. They just kinda remind me of you, I think you're exactly that kind of stubborn."</p><p>"You just don't like the idea of me dying."</p><p>Rio shrugs down at her, "Obviously."</p><p>Agatha grins, "Would you still love me if I was a jellyfish?"</p><p>"I'd relocate to a submarine in the mediterranean if it meant I could be near you every day."</p><p>Agatha feels like her lungs might fill with all the water in this aquarium if she doesn't kiss Rio right now. She fists her hands in the front of Rio's shirt—deep blue just for the occasion and slots their mouths together messily.</p><p>She doesn't ever want to kiss anyone else ever again, whines at the feeling of Rio's teeth scraping her bottom lip, desperate for everything they're willing to give her.</p><p>It takes Agatha licking into their mouth for Rio to break the kiss, still holding her close enough to taste their breath, "We probably shouldn't do this here."</p><p>"The jellyfish can't even see us."</p><p>"Yes, but I'm sure the people watching the cameras can."</p><p>Agatha rakes her nails down Rio's neck, relishes in their shiver, "It's not like we're doing anything <em>indecent."</em></p><p>"Baby, if you keep kissing me like that, there's no telling what I'll do."</p><p>Agatha swallows, "Not that I'm not having a good time, but maybe we skip past the gift shop and the cafe, and go straight home?"</p><p>Rio closes their eyes like even looking at Agatha is temptation enough, "I want to be a gentleman. I want to get this right."</p><p>"Would a gentleman leave me to touch myself after a kiss like that?" Agatha smiles, oh so innocent, "Is that the kind of boyfriend you are?"</p><p><em>"Boyfriend?"</em> Rio squeaks.</p><p>"You heard."</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't know a whole lot about what it takes to be a good driver, but she's fairly sure Rio just committed multiple violations in their attempt to make it home in nearly half the time it took for them to get there.</p><p>It's not something to dwell on when Rio pulls her up the stairs, stops to kiss her when they make it to the top like being apart had been painful, and then picks her up with ease to carry her the rest of the way to her bedroom.</p><p>"I love it when you do that," She gasps against their mouth, "I love how strong you are."</p><p>"Are there lots of things you love about me?" Rio grins as they throw Agatha on the bed, quickly unbuttoning their shirt as she shimmies her jeans down her thighs.</p><p>"Don't fish." Agatha glares up at them with a smile on her face.</p><p>For as quick and as desperate as they'd both been to get home and undressed, the moment they're both bare and Rio crawls onto the bed between Agatha's spread legs, their kisses grow languid. Agatha wraps a leg around their hips and rocks gently up into them, doesn't even want anything more for now.</p><p>Rio mouths against her neck, licks softly at the shell of her ear, trails kisses down to her breasts, and between it all, comes back to press soft kisses to her lips like they're returning home.</p><p>It sort of feels like their first time all over again—not a repeat, but just a <em>new</em> first time.</p><p><em>"God,"</em> Agatha whispers against their lips, "I love you."</p><p>Rio sort of looks like they might cry, "I love you too. I meant it the first time we did this."</p><p>"Yes, I—" Agatha burns, "I know that now."</p><p>Rio presses a kiss to Agatha's forehead then, and she thinks a small tear trickles down into her hair, but they don't mention it if it does.</p><p>"I want to make you feel good," Rio murmurs, pressing their lips back to Agatha's and knocking their teeth together as they speak. It might be off putting with anyone else.</p><p><em>"Please,"</em> Agatha holds their face in one hand, scrambles to grab at their hip with the other, "Please, I want you."</p><p>Rio presses a last kiss to her mouth before dragging their lips down her body, stops to give more attention to her tits—sucks her nipples into their mouth, nibbles gently on them and then soothes with their tongue. And then, when she grows sensitive, when she whines into the open and pushes up into their touch, they move on, leave dark bruises under their mouth on her stomach that they brush over with their thumbs.</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> Agatha breathes. She knows they don't mean to tease, but she needs more.</p><p>"I've got you."</p><p>They settle between her spread thighs and just look at her for a moment, as if mesmerized, before their arms wrap under her legs to hold her in place. They plant a kiss against Agatha's wet cunt and her hips strain but ultimately get her nothing more in Rio's strong grip.</p><p>"Patience, baby."</p><p>"I've waited for this forever," Agatha fits her hands over Rio's when they lift their head to look at her, "I lied when I said I fell in love with you when this started."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I think I've been in love with you for a long time and I just didn't want to see it. I didn't want to get hurt."</p><p>Rio presses a kiss to their joined hands, "I'm not going to hurt you."</p><p>Suddenly, they feel too far away, tightens her grip and <em>pulls,</em> "Come here." They don't deny her, presses their warm body back against her, "I want you like this."</p><p>"Do you want me to grab anything?" Rio glances over to her closet where she keeps her toys.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "I just want <em>you."</em></p><p>She gasps against their mouth when they fit their hand between their bodies, presses into her with two fingers, slow. Her hand finds its way to the back of their head, fingers playing with the ends of their hair as she melds around them.</p><p>"You want another?" Rio kisses her, high on her cheekbone, "You always take me so well."</p><p>Agatha nods, tilts her hips up as best she can with the limited space, and then gasps as she feels Rio pulling back to fit a third finger alongside. The push back in steals the air from her lungs just from how much she <em>feels</em> them <em>everywhere.</em></p><p>"My good girl," Rio whispers.</p><p><em>"Yours,"</em> Agatha agrees with a cry when Rio curls their fingers inside her, "And you're <em>mine."</em> She tilts her head to nip their jaw, encourages them to move just enough to give her access to their neck.</p><p>They don't seem to mind the very obvious hickey she's leaving on their throat, mostly mindless as she sucks and bites the delicate skin as she gets fucked.</p><p>Agatha does her best to keep her orgasm at bay, wants this to <em>last</em> even though she's pretty sure Rio isn't going to be done with her for hours. She just, she wants—</p><p>"I want you to come too," Agatha whines into their ear, "Can I touch you?"</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> Rio gasps, "Wanna feel you."</p><p>They lift up just enough for Agatha to push a hand between them, to fit her fingers against their clit. They're so wet there's barely any friction.</p><p>She's nowhere near filled to the extent she was the last time they did this, but still Agatha feels <em>full,</em> she feels like with every gasping breath she takes in enough air to sustain her, and her heart feels gently cradled with every rapid thud as she nears her orgasm.</p><p>"Rio, I—" Agatha slots their lips together, able to do little more than just pant into Rio's mouth, "I'm gonna—"</p><p>"That's it, my good girl. Come for me."</p><p>Agatha can't hold it off any longer, clenches around Rio's fingers, digs her nails into their shoulder as her vision spots behind her closed eyes.</p><p>Rio fucks her through it, slower as their hips buck into her fingers, chasing their own orgasm.</p><p>"My love," Her voice sounds <em>wrecked,</em> "You've done so good. Let go."</p><p>She keeps her fingers as solid as possible for them to slip against, making breathy whimpers against the side of her face until they shudder, fingers slowing to a halt inside of Agatha as they come.</p><p><em>"God,</em> I—" Rio's voice is tear-filled and choked when they speak, "I thought maybe you might disappear. Like I'd made this all up."</p><p>Agatha nudges her nose against Rio's, "I'm not going anywhere."</p><p>Preferably, Agatha would like to mean that in it's most basic form—doesn't ever want to leave this bed, doesn't want to be away from Rio for even a second.</p><p>She'll settle for a fourth finger stretching her out and making sure she'll still feel them inside her tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It is 3:37am and Jen's phone won't stop buzzing.</p><p>She leaves it on vibrate for <em>emergencies.</em></p><p>But Agatha doesn't call <em>unless</em> it's an emergency.</p><p>"What?" She might be willing to bury a body, but she doesn't have to be <em>happy</em> about it.</p><p><em>"I thought you should know first."</em> Jen can hardly hear her with how quiet she's speaking.</p><p>"Why are we whispering?"</p><p><em>"Rio's asleep,"</em> Right, they're having another one of their <em>very platonic</em> sleepovers where they definitely don't scissor to help each other fall asleep, <em>"But I couldn't wait."</em></p><p>"For <em>what?"</em></p><p><em>"Rio is my boyfriend. As of today. Or yesterday. Semantics."</em></p><p>Fucking <em>finally.</em></p><p>"Okay, cool. Night, Agatha—"</p><p><em>"Wait!"</em> Agatha's voice raises and then she repeats it, whispered, <em>"Wait, did you hear me?"</em></p><p>"Rio's your boyfriend, yeah I heard you. About time you made it official, it's been like mating season being around you."</p><p>Agatha splutters on the end of the line.</p><p>"If that's everything, I have a quick text to send into the groupchat I'm in with Alice and Wanda. They owe me money."</p><p><em>"You </em>bet<em> on us?"</em></p><p>"Four years is a long time to wait for fifty dollars, Agatha." Jen settles against her pillows again, satisfied.</p><p><em>"Four—"</em> Agatha is louder this time and Jen can hear her shushing Rio in the background, gentler sounding with them than she's ever heard her. Good for her.</p><p>"I'm not waiting longer than two days for you to tell us the whole story, by the way."</p><p>Agatha has the nerve to laugh like Jen hasn't pretty much had confirmation they were fucking since she <em>happened</em> to run into Rio, <em>"There's not a whole lot to tell."</em></p><p>"Maybe start at the beginning," Jen yawns, finger over the red <em>end call</em> button, "Fifteen years ago when you fell in love with each other."</p><p>And then she ends the call, about to be fifty dollars richer, and holding news that, ultimately, won't change a thing about their friend circle.</p><p>Rio's wacky neighbor Lilia already told her they'd work out and not to worry, that they <em>audibly had a lot of chemistry.</em></p><p><em>"My dear,"</em> She had said upon knowing Jen for five minutes, cupped her cheek in her hand like they were old friends, <em>"Love always finds a way."</em></p>
