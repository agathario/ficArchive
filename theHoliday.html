<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>December in New York was easily the time of the year Agatha hated the most. The streets were constantly crowded with families, cars sounding their horns, and the most cheesy irritating decorations humanity had ever created. And the snow. Agatha hated the snow, how it melted into unsanitary puddles in every single corner of the street, staining her clothes any time she accidentally stepped on them. The rain she could tolerate: it helped her plants survive, because otherwise she would never remember to water them. But the snow killed them even faster than she was able to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, as Christmas began to approach, she decided to plan ahead. She needed to get out of that city, away from the snow and from the people screaming into their phones every single hour of the day. Did no one ever sleep? Agatha opened her laptop and started searching for houses for rent on the West Coast, as far away from her apartment as possible. Somewhere warm, somewhere she would be able to see the sun while she worked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scrolled past a few websites, none of them convincing her. The apartments lacked personality, the houses were too big or full of family portraits. She hated every single one of them. It was impossible, she would be forced to spend the holidays stuck in her apartment listening to children screaming from the streets and their parents yelling at them. It was just her luck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath in. No. She would not let anything ruin her plans. Since she had started therapy at her friend Alice’s suggestion, she had been trying not to let small things bother her. And being unable to find a house where she could spend just a few nights in was a small thing, right? She closed her eyes. Counted: one, two, three, four, five. She opened them and stared at the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Small house for rent</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>California</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>December</span>
</em>
<span>. She typed the words into the search bar, patiently waiting for something to call to her. Once again, all of the options looked awful, but she kept going, scrolling down until the very last advertisement on the page.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>HOUSE SWAP! The easiest, fastest and safest way to find a getaway spot for your holidays!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was intriguing enough, Agatha decided before clicking on the link. There were users from all over the world posting pictures of their houses, with witty captions describing their homes in a lousy attempt at catching a potential renter’s attention. Agatha didn’t fall for any of them, her eyes flying over the thousand of images and words in big bold letters. To make things easier for her, she turned some filters on, focusing her search on beach houses in California. Only one ad popped up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The place looked more like a cottage than an actual house, Agatha noticed as she analyzed the pictures. It was clearly a small place, a small living room and kitchen on the ground floor, and one even smaller bedroom and bathroom upstairs. From the outside, the stone walls made it look like the kind of place you would find hidden in an ancient forest, and maybe it was exactly that quality that caught Agatha’s eye. Inside, it was tastefully decorated, and there were no portraits hanging on the walls. In fact, unlike the rest of the users on the site, the owner of the house had not posted a single picture of their face. The only clue Agatha had was a name: Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she scanned the page, Agatha waited for the other shoe to drop. Something had to be wrong with the place, she thought to herself. But no, it was just a 5-minute walk away from the beach in Malibu. It was free for her to rent starting the next day. And the owner was online.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clicked and opened up a text-chain between them.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hello</span>
</em>
<span>, she typed. </span>
<em>
<span>I like your house</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She waited a few seconds, but nothing happened. Maybe the thing was broken? She was about to close the page and throw her laptop away when three dots popped up on the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hi. Thank you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>How charming.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I would like to rent it</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha needed the conversation to be over as soon as possible. She did not like talking to strangers, and she wanted to have the entire holiday issue solved quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Can I see your place?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What? No</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha frowned at her screen as she replied. This person was starting to get on her nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s a house-swapping site. I thought the giant ad on the main page made it obvious</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood up from her chair and moved away from the desk, her hands covering her face as she tried to calm herself down. It was just a dumb vacation. A small thing. Breathe in. Breathe out. She sat down again in front of the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What do you want to know? I don’t have pictures</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Then describe it</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, that she could do.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s an apartment in New York. It’s not huge, but enough for one person</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat, no answer. She waited, thinking maybe she had not done a great job at selling her place. It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> actually huge, even compared to the Malibu cottage. And she loved the apartment, because it was hers. It was her safe place, where no one bothered her, where she could spend days locked up writing until her eyes melted or her fingers started to cramp. Maybe staying wouldn’t be so bad—.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud alarm coming from the street interrupted her train of thought. She needed to get out, fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers hovered above the keyboard as she thought of something to add.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m in. When can you come?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled to herself, and her entire body relaxed as she pictured herself on a beach, the sun warming her face.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How does tomorrow sound?</span>
</em>
</p>

<p>
<span>Having lived in California for most of her life, Rio Vidal was used to the warm feeling of the sun hitting her face in the morning just a few days away from Christmas. In fact, she loved waking up early in the morning when the light started to creep into her room through the blinds, which she left open on purpose. Every day, she made time to have breakfast in her backyard, enjoying the silence that was only briefly interrupted by the chirping sound of the birds. Half an hour later, her friend Jen picked her up and drove her to the flower shop Rio owned, and where Jen had also started working a year ago. Usually, they drove in silence until Jen began asking Rio about her day, trying to get her to talk. Once that failed, Jen started to chat about the new stray cat she had adopted alongside her girlfriend, Alice. Then they worked in the shop, Jen greeting the clients while Rio took care of the plants in the back, until they closed the place up, and the day found its end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a quiet, simple routine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio loved it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, during the past few weeks, both Jen and Alice had started suggesting Rio should take a small vacation. They were both leaving Malibu to spend a few days together in Brazil, so Rio could easily close the shop for a couple of weeks and get away. It was a sensible idea, and she had never, not once in her life, taken a day off, unless she was on the verge of dying. A break sounded nice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, one afternoon after work, she sat down on her sofa, her laptop on her lap and her friends  on either side of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, where do you want to go?” Jen started as soon as they all sat down, their bodies so close together in a way that would usually make Rio shudder uncomfortably. But these were her friends, so her usual barriers were a little more loose than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no fucking idea,” Rio replied, her brain considering the infinite options. “I’m open to suggestions”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want a beach? Or maybe going hiking? Swimming with sharks? Hot air balloons?” Jen went on, swiftly taking the computer from Rio’s hands and typing in different searches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve done all of that”. And it was true. Luckily, Rio had been everywhere when she was younger, before opening the shop. She wanted something new, something she had never seen before. “Somewhere with snow? I’ve never seen snow… that could be cool, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Alice jumped in, bumping her shoulder excitedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer was already typing something into her computer, her eyes scanning the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… how does New York sound?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice turned to face her girlfriend, frowning. They knew her too well, Rio thought when seeing the looks they exchanged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you insane, Jen? This one here,” she gestured her head towards Rio, “wouldn’t last a day in New York!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on, babe, it would be good for her. She’ll get a snowy Christmas! And plus, there’s tons of LGBT bars, so she’ll definitely get laid!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm, excuse me, I’m still here” Rio mumbled, her eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, sorry,” Jen replied, smiling at her. Her hands still lingered above the keyboard, silently typing. “So, what do you think about New York?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, finding an apartment there will be impossible—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already found one!” Jen interrupted her, turning the laptop around so Rio could see the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a huge picture of her own house on the screen. Rio frowned, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She read the words on the site. </span>
<em>
<span>Beautiful beach house in Malibu!</span>
</em>
<span> said in bold letters above a picture seemingly taken from outside her place. Rio looked at the name of the site: </span>
<em>
<span>HOUSE SWAP!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen,” she began slowly, trying her best to sound composed. “What the fuck is this, and why is my house on it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked proud of herself. When she didn’t reply, Rio turned to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice blushed, already nervous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, we did this thing before we booked our flight to Brazil,” she started. When Rio raised her eyebrows, she continued. “It’s just a site where you post your house, and if someone likes it, they’ll come to your place, and you’ll go to theirs. We posted your place just to see if we could find somewhere to go”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sounded truly apologetic, so Rio tried her best not to be mad. But she was mad. She was furious, for some reason she couldn’t yet fully grasp. She didn’t really mind them using the pictures of her house, to be honest. But it was under her own name, and when Rio went back to examine the screen again, she saw there was a chat already opened between her (or well, Jennifer) and some user named A. H. She took a deep breath in, not bothering to read what it said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay?” Jen asked. She was probably expecting an angry outburst from Rio, and was already prepared to handle it. But the calm and collected response took her by surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay. Who is this A. H., where exactly do they live, and when am </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> leaving?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked at Alice, smiling. They both turned to her at the same time, and Rio sighed. She hated when they were so in sync. It was disgustingly sweet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Jen who spoke, without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow”.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>In just a few hours, Agatha had already booked her flight, packed her small suitcase, and made an itinerary for the following three weeks. The constant noises coming up through her balcony from the streets served as a reminder of why she was in such a hurry, and why the whole thing was not a crazy idea, at all. She simply </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to get away from the city, that much was clear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she finished cleaning up her apartment for her guest —there were piles of clothes everywhere, pages full of writing scattered on the bedroom floor, and crumbs of something she’d eaten a few days ago all over her desk— she tried to register the suggestions that her friend, Lilia Calderu, was mentioning over the phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, each time you come out of the water, you have to reapply your sunscreen, okay?” she was asking. When no answer came, she pressed. “Agatha? Are you even listening to what I’m saying?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Lilia, yes,” Agatha replied in an exaggeratedly annoyed tone. “I’m just looking for something… do  you remember where I put my passport?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As much as Agatha enjoyed complaining about her friend, she knew she would drown without her. Lilia was basically the only family she had —not in New York, specifically, but in general. Her friend kept her in check, reminded her to drink water on a regular basis, and listened to her without an ounce of judgment. Agatha would probably never admit how much she loved and needed her in public, and luckily Lilia seemed to understand that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud tired sigh was heard from the speaker. “Yes, you idiot. It’s already in your purse”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, yes. I’m just—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud honk interrupted whatever half-assed excuse Agatha was about to provide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think my cab’s here".</span>
</p><p>
<span>Anxiously, she grabbed whatever piece of paper still on her desk (she would probably need them if she was going to get any work done, she thought) and shoved them into her purse. She placed her phone between her left ear and her shoulder, grabbed her suitcase, and left her apartment.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The flight hadn’t been that bad, probably because Agatha had spent the entire six hours sound asleep, thanks to the magic pill she carried for such occasions. She could not be bothered with boring small talk with whomever sat besides her, the mere idea of having to spend hours listening to some stranger’s rambling, unable to escape, terrifying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Noise-cancelling headphones were one of the greatest human inventions, Agatha Harkness thought to herself as she walked through the L.A. airport, dodging the thousands of tourists as she made her way to the door where a cab was already waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the car left the city, past Santa Monica and towards Malibu, Agatha took in the view through the window. It had been years since she had seen so much nature in one place. Having lived in New York for most of her adult life, Agatha was used to the sound of sirens, the overlapping of voices in a variety of languages that her brain was always too slow to understand, or the low but constant noise of some construction site. Her eyes were already trained to expect blocks full of tall buildings that seemed to extend infinitely upwards, or to appreciate (but sometimes despise) the dramatic outfits new-yorkers wore every single day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was not used to the silence that reigned in the highway when she took her headphones off, interrupted only by the sound of some birdsong. Surprisingly, Agatha found it soothing, not needing to have her ears covered to avoid the noises filling her brain. The contrast between the deep blue of the sea to her left and the sandy muted colors of the hills to her right somehow made sense, she thought to herself as the driver took her closer to her destination.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, Agatha found herself standing on the driveway of the house she’d seen online just 24 hours before. She lifted her sunglasses, placing them on her head, and took a deep breath, just as Lilia suggested she did whenever she felt stressed or anxious. Her chest filled with fresh air, and she smiled lightly to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The front porch was basically covered with plants, pots everywhere leading the way to the door. Agatha quickly spotted the one green pot near the entrance, where she found the keys to the house, just as the owner —Rio something, she tried to remember— had told her. Agatha picked them up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was sliding the key into the lock, the door swung open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back, startled. She looked up, puzzled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing in front of her, inside the house, was a black-haired woman a few centimeters taller than her, brown eyes finding her own and meeting her with a calmness that threw Agatha off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm, hi,” the woman said. She offered her hand. “I’m Rio Vidal”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was screwed.</span>

<p>Luckily for Rio, her friends had mostly finished planning their own vacation, which meant they were free to help her plan for hers.</p><p>After a short conversation about boundaries and not posting your friend’s house online without permission, Jen and Alice had decided to sleep over at Rio’s that night to help her pack, book flights, and tidy her place up. And Rio was grateful, because she was sure she wouldn’t be able to handle all of that on her own, not in less than a day. So, after dinner, while her friends were choosing outfits for her in her room, Rio sat on the couch, laptop on her lap, and began searching for things to do in New York. She tried making an itinerary, but gave up five minutes later as she realized it was too much information. Her head hurt, and she fell sound asleep right there and then.</p><p>When the sunlight coming in from the windows became too strong on her face, Rio woke up. Her body moved unwillingly, and every single bone in her back ached in response. Falling asleep on her couch? Not a good idea, apparently. She rubbed at her eyes, adjusting to the light. She opened them, slowly, and frowned when she saw Jen and Alice sitting on the table right in front of her.</p><p>“What…,” she began, but then remembered. She was supposed to leave for New York in a couple of hours. She sat up straight. “Good morning”.</p><p>Alice smiled at her in a way that concerned Rio. She seemed worried, for some reason. “Hey, sweetie”.</p><p>Rio looked at Jen then, and the frustration in her face was apparent. Alice was usually good at pretending and hiding her emotions, but Jen? Jen was the opposite, every single feeling showing up on her face just as strongly as she felt it.</p><p>So Rio looked into her friend’s face for an answer. “What is it? What 's wrong?”</p><p>Jen exhaled, then nodded towards the phone in her hand. She was pissed. “Your flight’s been cancelled. Some sort of strike going on, they said. I’ve been yelling at the company for the last hour, and they agreed to give you your money back, but there’s just no way you’re leaving today”.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio,” Alice added. “If it helps, our flight to Brazil has also been cancelled, so at least we’ll be together”.</p><p>Rio knew she should feel angry, or irritated, at least. Her one vacation, and it was over before it had even started. But deep down, she felt relieved. New York seemed like too much for her to handle, and she could still take a few days off from her shop and relax in her house, spend the holidays with her friends.</p><p>She shrugged the whole thing off, unworried. “It 's fine. I mean’ I’m sorry for you guys, but I’m fine staying here with you”.</p><p>Jen still looked preoccupied, which was not a good sign.</p><p>Again, Alice tried to ease her into what seemed to be more bad news. “There’s one more thing…”</p><p>“A. H., the newyorker who rented your house? They’re still coming today”. Jen sounded just as annoyed as Rio felt.</p><p>“Well, can’t <em> we </em> cancel?” Rio asked.</p><p>“They’re already on their way here. In fact, they should be here in an hour, at most”.</p><p>Rio sighed. She had just woken up only five minutes ago, but she was already exhausted.</p><p>“Fine. You guys go ahead, I’ll deal with this”.</p><p>“How? Alice knew her well enough by then: dealing with things, in Rio’s world, usually meant pretending they weren’t happening until they blew up in her face.</p><p>“I have no idea”.</p><p>Rio spent the following fifteen minutes convincing her friends she was fine while she washed her face and changed into more presentable clothes. Once she was dressed —an old gray cut-off shirt and a pair of denim shorts— she led her friends towards the front door, almost pushing them outside so she could, as she’d told them, “plan ahead” or, what was more accurate, sit outside in her backyard until the mystery tenant arrived.</p><p>And that was exactly what she did.</p><p>She did call a few hotels to check if maybe she could find a room somewhere else, but they were all fully booked. Just her luck.</p><p>So, when Rio heard a car approaching her house, she had absolutely no plan on how she would handle the situation. She did know she could not kick the tenant out, that late, without facing the possibility of being sued. And she really wanted to avoid being sued. Surely the mysterious A. H. wouldn’t mind sleeping in the guest room so Rio could stay at her house.</p><p>As she heard heels clicking along the stones that created a path to her door in the driveway, Rio stood up, heading for the door. Before the stranger had the chance to even turn the key, she opened the door abruptly.</p><p>“Uhm, hi,” she said, but her voice came out like a murmur. She extended her hand, trying to sound more confident. “I’m Rio Vidal”.</p><p>The first thing Rio noticed was how gorgeous the woman in front of her was. Her hair was messily tied into a sort of bun, but a few strands fell onto a face that could’ve easily fit into the front cover of any beauty magazine. She was wearing a striped creamy button-up and linen pants that hugged her body exactly where Rio would've want it to.</p><p>Rio was staring. She shook her head, an assured smile forming in her lips. This could be fun, she realized.</p><p>“You’re A. H., right? Come on in, please”.</p><p>Rio moved out of the way, letting the woman, who was still visibly shocked, into her house. Rio closed the door behind them, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Nice to meet you too,” Rio replied, a tinge of irony in her voice, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>But the woman wouldn’t budge. One of her hands was still holding onto the handle of her suitcase, the other resting on her hip. She looked defiant, seemingly unfazed by Rio’s charm.</p><p>Rio let out a sigh. “Okay, so my flight was cancelled a few hours ago,” she said, giving in. “I couldn’t buy another ticket, and most hotels here are already full. So, I’m here”.</p><p>The woman simply nodded, taking the information in. “And you expect me to leave?”</p><p>“What? No, no way. I figured you could stay in my guest room, I’ll stay in my own room, and we’ll share the rest. At least until we come up with a better idea”.</p><p>Rio could see the wheels turning inside the woman’s head, trying to decide whether she would stay or leave. “I promise I won’t bother you,” she said. “Not unless you want me to,” she added, sending a wink the woman’s way.</p><p>Surprisingly, the woman nodded again, but her eyes were elsewhere, looking around at the house. “Fine,” she murmured. “We have a deal”.</p><p>Rio didn’t know how they would live together for the following weeks, but she did know one thing: she wanted to sleep with this woman.</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha was screwed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Living with Rio Vidal was not exactly what Agatha had in mind when she planned her holidays. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Her housemate seemed programmed to behave precisely like Agatha’s own antithesis. Whenever she decided to sleep in, having stayed up until late writing the night before, Rio shockingly chose to wake up at 7a.m., the noises she made in the kitchen while making breakfast interrupting even Agatha’s heavy sleeping. Anytime Agatha headed to the living room with her laptop after dinner, Rio had already turned every single light off, signaling her going to bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not only did they have conflicting living schedules, but their personalities appeared to be a match made in hell. Initially, Rio had very clearly tried to establish a sort of friendship between them, joining Agatha for breakfast in the kitchen, sneaking up on her while she was reading with the weirdest noises. However, after a few days of utter silence from Agatha’s side, Rio had given up. And Agatha was glad, she really was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After their first encounter, when they had established a provisional living arrangement, Agatha had taken out her phone to stalk the other woman on social media. From what she gathered, she was a few years younger, owned some kind of flower shop and had two very close friends —Alice and Janice, or something like that. Agatha had taken a screenshot of her Instagram page and sent it to Lilia, with the caption </span>
<em>
<span>Owner of the house. Annoying</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her friend had replied something about how hot Rio looked in the pictures, but Agatha had very pointedly ignored the text. Once her mind was made up about something, or rather, someone, there was no point in trying to change her stance. And she had already decided she didn't like Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So no, she did not notice how good her arms looked whenever she showed up in the kitchen wearing a tank top, or the strip of skin that peeked from under her shirt when she stretched to grab something from a tall shelf. Agatha never once thought about the black jeans Rio usually wore, or how they highlighted her ass. No, she never once noticed any of those things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Days went by, and Agatha spent most of them at the beach either writing or reading. Her boss had told her she could take those few weeks off, but Agatha wouldn’t hear of it. Besides, if she didn’t work, she would probably die of boredom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Malibu was beautiful, and the weather so far had been nice enough that she could spend hours at the beach without feeling cold. However, she was made painfully aware of how alone she was. Without Lilia, basically her only friend, Agatha had no one to talk to. She did call Lilia every couple of days, and texted her every single thought that crossed her mind nonstop. Still, she was starting to feel lonely. Back at home, in New York, her lack of social life was usually covered up under the constant crowds surrounding her. That was precisely one of the things she both hated and loved about the city: she was never truly alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Here, that fact became inescapable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Besides, seeing Rio with her own friends didn’t help the matter. After their initial hostility (which yes, was mainly Agatha’s fault), Rio had mostly avoided her when she was at the house. They were cordial to each other, a quiet greeting whenever one of them came into a room. But they never really </span>
<em>
<span>talked</span>
</em>
<span> to each other. Agatha did notice that Rio spent most of her time outside, and whenever she was home she was usually on the phone with one of her friends, making plans for the evening. Rio wasn’t usually late at night, but she did dress each time like she was going on dates. Not that Agatha really cared, but it was hard not to notice it when she was working in the living room and Rio came out of her room in insanely attractive outfits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Usually, Rio walked right past her, whispered a small “Goodbye,” and left, the door closing behind her loudly enough that Agatha was reminded of her dislike for the woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I cannot tolerate her any longer, Lil!” she began before her friend had even the chance to greet her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, first of all, hi,” Lilia started. She tended to be way more calm than Agatha, so her soothing voice always helped when she was stressed, angry, or both. “Second of all, who the hell are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sitting on her bed in the guest room, and Rio had left a few hours ago for work or whatever it was she did on a Saturday mornings. “I mean Rio, the house owner. She’s impossible to live with”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her? She looked so… chill, I guess, from what you told me”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she’s not. She’s always waking up at insane hours, like 8 a.m., talking to her friends, going out every night like she’s going on a date or something. I mean, who even has that many dates in one week, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, waiting for her friend to immediately agree with her. As usual, she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds to me like she’s a normal human being, with a normal social life”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but since Lilia could not see her, she made her point by exhaling loudly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s annoying, and weird. And she won’t leave”. She was aware she sounded like a spoiled child, but she didn’t care. This was </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> holiday, and this woman was ruining it for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you could try being nice to her? Or you know, just not being a complete asshole when she’s around”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she quickly replied, not giving the suggestion a second thought. “Besides, it’s not like she likes me, either. She won’t even look my way when I’m near”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that, Lilia stayed silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello? What are you thinking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her friend seemed to wake up, and Agatha could’ve sworn she heard a smile in her voice. “Oh, nothing. Just that you seem to be paying tons of attention to what this Rio does, that’s all”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t like what you’re suggesting, and I don’t like your tone,” Agatha answered, and with that she hung up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was definitely </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> paying attention to Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>As if Agatha’s conversation with Lilia had summoned her, Rio showed up on Agatha’s door the following night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was laying on the bed, a book on her hand and her laptop thrown on the duvet a few centimeters away from her. She’d had dinner earlier that night, so she was already wearing her pajamas: some old black shorts that only barely covered her ass, and a white cami tank top. She was deep in concentration, having finally been able to focus on the words on the pages, when she heard someone knocking at her door.}</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” she shouted to the wooden door, annoyed at the interruption.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Rio. Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her head back against the pillows, dramatically. This woman was going to drive her insane. “No! Give me a second”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She got up, and as she walked to the door she caught sight of herself on the mirror placed against one of the walls. Quickly, she tousled her hair, trying to make it look like she had not been laying in bed a few seconds before. She also took the chance to adjust her chest in her shirt, because one never knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she opened the door, she found Rio looking like she did most nights: insanely hot. The woman was wearing her black pants but, instead of the usual white button-up, she had a black vest that exposed her toned arms. Looking up, Agatha noticed how the black liner around her eyes made them stand out, made her look entrancing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Normally, Agatha wouldn’t bother hiding her attraction for a woman. She tended to be unashamed, completely aware of her own charms, and knew how to flirt, how to fill her voice with lust in order to get what she wanted. This time, however, something in her body flinched. It was probably the extreme aversion she had started to build towards the woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you need?” she asked, her tone unwelcoming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth was slightly ajar, a sly smile on her lips, and Agatha arched one of her eyebrows. Rio’s eyes were clearly not on her face, but rather focused a bit lower. Agatha tried not to think about it, but she couldn’t help the heated feeling of pride that flooded through her. Swiftly, Rio’s eyes moved to meet her own, but she still said nothing. God, this woman was impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you here to tell me something, or just to annoy me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both, apparently”. Rio was smiling at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you need?” Agatha repeated, her patience draining out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio nodded, almost to herself. “My friends and I are going out to this bar tonight, so I thought maybe you would want to join us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was taken aback. She had expected some sort of complaint from her housemate, some passive-aggressive comment about the typing noises coming from her room late at night. She had surely not expected what seemed like an honest invitation to… hang out? Agatha was not used to that, to people other than Lilia inviting her to things. She didn’t know how to react.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” was all that came out of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, if you want to,” Rio added, cutting into her thoughts. “It’ll be fun”. She shrugged, her previous charm and wit suddenly apparently gone, something almost like nerves in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet,” Agatha replied before she could think twice. That was rude, she reminded herself, and so far it had been a polite interaction. She tried to correct herself. “I have work to do, but thanks for the invite”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something passed through Rio’s eyes, but Agatha was unable to decipher exactly what that was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, sure”. Rio moved away from Agatha, clearly not interested in insisting. “Well then, have a good night”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “You too”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a tight smile, turned around, and left her alone, standing against the door frame.</span>

<p>
<span>The music in the bar was loud enough that Rio had to lean in across the table to hear Alice’s story. Something about an old song she’d found on some weird witchcraft blog on the internet. It was hard to focus, with the pounding music and the dim lights that made it nearly impossible to see clearly. After days of going out, Rio was starting to hate the nightlife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the past week, Alice and Jen had dragged Rio to most, if not all, queer bars in Malibu, in a desperate but well-meaning attempt at getting her to flirt with someone. Although the plan had failed, Rio had actually enjoyed getting ready for those nights, wearing clothes that highlighted her body and makeup that made her feel confident in a way she hadn’t felt in years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had tried to make her intentions painfully clear, asking her housemate about her life, complimenting her, even lingering in the living room while she worked. And yet, nothing. Agatha very clearly disliked her: she practically grunted whenever Rio tried to talk to her, left the house when Rio came in, or ignored her presence entirely. So Rio had given up. She would not chase after a woman who couldn’t stand her, especially not in her own house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio couldn’t help mentally high-fiving herself whenever she found Agatha staring at her before a night out. Granted, Agatha still looked at her with that maddening combination of disdain and amusement, but every single night Rio lived for the moment where the former feeling dissipated, even slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had discussed the situation with her friends. Alice had suggested leaving the house more, avoiding conflict altogether. As per usual, Jen had been less forgiving. The solutions she’d come up with were more aggressive, ranging from threats of kicking Agatha out to giving her food-poisoning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she’s a bit rough around the edges, but she also seems kind of lonely, I don’t know…” Rio admitted one night. She didn’t fully understand why she felt the need to defend Agatha in front of her friends, but she did. Deep down, she knew her housemate wasn’t really all bad. She couldn’t be —not with that laugh that Rio had overheard late at night coming from her room. That laugh, so loud it was almost cartoonish, had to belong to someone fun, at the very least.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why don’t you just ask her out?” Alice proposed, shrugging it off like it was no big deal, and not the most terrifying idea Rio had heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you insane? She’d probably kill me in my sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on,” Jen chimed in, rolling her eyes. “Just tell her we’re all hanging out some night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It can’t be that bad,” Alice added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’ll simply kick her ass if she’s mean to you,” Jen said, and Rio had no doubt she was not exaggerating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That had been the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, as Rio tried to follow the conversation her friends were having, she knew that was it. She’d tried hitting on her, then ignoring her, then being polite, and finally being just a nice human being with basic decency. Agatha didn’t want them to be friendly? That was fine by her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio downed the contents of her glass, wincing as the liquid burned her throat. Alice was still rambling, but Jen was looking at her, her eyebrows raised. Rio simply shrugged in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio rose from her place at the table to order another round of drinks, her eyes moved to the bar’s entrance. Someone caught her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” she muttered under her breath, her eyes fixed on the woman coming in through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Rio’s life were a movie, the director very clearly hated her. It was unfair, how the low lights hit Agatha like she was a model, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders to meet the thin straps that gave way to a tight black dress that clung to her figure perfectly. The music seemed to fade, and Rio could do nothing but stare like an idiot. Agatha looked hot. Too hot for Rio’s already tipsy brain to process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had not noticed her yet, luckily. The older woman stood near the entrance, looking around the room, seemingly trying to find something. It was endearing, how lost she looked, Rio thought to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, after what felt like centuries, Agatha’s eyes found her. Those damn eyes. Even from a distance, Rio could still feel her train of thought getting derailed by those blue eyes. Rio was aware she must’ve looked stupid, so she gave Agatha a small wave of the hand. When the woman responded with a faint smile, Rio gestured towards her table. As Agatha started walking to her, Rio exhaled, trying to steady herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down to meet her friends. Jen still had that confused look on her face, frowning. Alice was smiling, clearly amused by the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes before they could tease her. “Just shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha said as she reached them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them were standing one in front of the other, next to the table, like they were sizing each other up before either a dance or a duel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio replied, trying to force back a smile. “You came.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, Agatha let out a huff that almost sounded like a laugh. “Yeah, I did.” She looked around the place, her hands gesturing to cover the entire room. “I figured I should come out and see what’s got my landlady so busy every night, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, a smile forming on her face against her will. “Right, of course”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mind was racing. She was painfully aware of the fact that both Alice and Jen were still staring at them, enjoying the entire scene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you even know I was here? I don’t think I mentioned the place,” Rio asked, the words coming from her mouth before she could consider them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows, and Rio wished she didn’t look that gorgeous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just lucky, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio had time to consider the answer, Alice coughed, moving an empty chair towards Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, this is Alice,” Rio said, her hand gesturing to her friends. “And that’s Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio sat down at the table, and Rio finally relaxed.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Hours went by as the four of them talked uninterruptedly —Alice revealing nearly every single detail of her life, Jen teasing her about it, and Agatha smiling kindly as she listened— but to Rio it felt like seconds. The only indicator that they hadn’t all frozen in time was the amount of people migrating from their seats to the improvised dance floor, and the switch from slow jazz to more upbeat music. The bar was slowly turning into the nightclub Alice adored, and Rio despised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There had also been a change in the people surrounding them: it was mostly women now, everyone with a drink in their hands dancing close together. A couple of girls had even approached her table, asking Rio to dance, sending smirks her way. Each time, she politely declined. Her mind was focused on something else that night, and she was genuinely having fun. She wasn’t looking for a date that night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Rio wanted nothing more than to get out, move the conversation elsewhere, but Jen and Alice were in the middle of telling Agatha the story of the time they visited Italy and ended up lost in the Alps. She could not interrupt that, not only because it was a great story —Jen had freaked out, thinking they would be buried under the snow, only for an old couple who lived there to find them and offer refuge— but also because she could not take her eyes off Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked stunning, the soft lights illuminating her skin, accentuating the delicate crinkles that formed near her eyes whenever she laughed, the strands of hair that fell on her face as she moved, and those lips—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music was growing louder, and soon it became hard to keep up a conversation between the four of them. As usual, Jen had snuggled against Alice’s side, whispering probably inappropriate things in her girlfriend’s ear. When Agatha looked at Rio with a smile, nodding toward the couple, Rio raised her shoulders and returned the grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a beat, Agatha got up. Rio was aware she was talking to her, but between the music and the fuzziness in her brain —caused by the alcohol in her blood, undoubtedly— she couldn’t hear a word. She stared as the other woman left the table, her eyes following that tiny black dress across the room like a magnet as she headed to the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Agatha was out of earshot, her friends were back to their normal selves, staring at her. Jen’s questioning look was back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She lied, you know?” she said after pulling her chair nearer so they could talk. Alice simply smiled next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About how she found you,” Jen started, but then corrected herself. “How she found the bar, I mean. It wasn’t luck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was it?” she replied, already annoyed by her friend’s conspiracies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She stalked me on Instagram, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it was Rio’s turn to look confused. “That’s ridiculous, Jen. She didn’t even know you existed before tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen held up her hands in mock surrender. “Listen, I’m just telling you what I saw. One Agatha Harkness saw the story I posted of you with this location, and five minutes later she was here”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s true, she showed me the second Agatha came in, ”Alice chimed in, supporting Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “So what? She was probably bored, wanted to come, and instead of texting me like a normal human being, she stalked you. What’s the big deal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words sounded harsher than she’d meant to, she realized as Alice shot a quick look to her girlfriend, amused by Rio’s defensive tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If anything,” she added, trying to soften her tone, “it proves she dislikes me enough that she wouldn’t even text me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just saying—” Jen began again, but the rest of her sentence escaped Rio’s hearing. Her eyes were suddenly back at the bar, fixated on a particular pair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was standing against the wooden bar, her back against an empty stool, a shot glass in her hand. But she wasn’t alone. Someone, a woman, was talking to her, smiling. And Agatha was laughing. Really laughing, her head thrown back, her cheeks slightly flushed in a way Rio hadn’t seen before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman was gorgeous, Rio had to admit. Her red hair was accentuated by her bright scarlet lace dress. Even from a distance Rio could notice she was hot. And Agatha clearly thought so too, if the way her free hand brushed against the woman’s bare thigh was any indicator. Rio felt her jaw tighten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Alice’s voice barely registered as a distant hum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a huff in response, her breathing accelerated, her blood running hot. The woman was now standing closer to Agatha. Rio didn’t look away, </span>
<em>
<span>couldn’t</span>
</em>
<span>. Her hand was holding her empty beer pint, and her fingers closed around it strongly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe we should head out now…” Alice suggested, her tone cautious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio wasn’t listening. The woman stepped closer still. Agatha didn’t pull away. Her head bent down towards Agatha, who was smirking confidently. Rio’s grip on the glass became ironclad. She felt the tension spread through her body, heat rising to her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the redhead moved to Agatha’s neck, seemingly whispering something in her ear, Rio felt the blood rushing to her ears. She was holding her breath, waiting for one of them to move away, for something to break the spell. She was witnessing the scene in utter silence when the glass finally gave in, shattering between her fingers.</span>

<p>
<span>As soon as Rio closed the main door behind her, Agatha started pacing around her room. Her brain was overflowing with thoughts and questions. Was Rio actually being nice to her? And why did she feel an inexplicable urge to go after her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached for her phone, discarded on her bed, intending to text Lilia, but stopped at the last second. She knew if she texted her friend it would only lead to overthinking the situation. And she was tired of overthinking things. Besides, Agatha could not refuse the opportunity to annoy Rio Vidal in public.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had not given her the address for the bar —probably because Agatha had rejected her invitation with no hesitation— but a few minutes of harmless stalking fixed that. Rio’s friend, Jennifer, had posted a story minutes ago showing Rio and their location. In the picture, Rio was looking away from the camera, her neck and jaw exposed to the lens. The rest of the bar faded in the background, and Agatha’s eyes lingered for a moment, taking it in. Agatha was mature enough that she was able to put her dislike for the woman aside to appreciate how striking Rio looked. That picture alone was all the motivation Agatha needed to go out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Proud of her stalking abilities —and completely oblivious to the fact that story views were public— Agatha decided to change.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Half an hour later, Agatha Harkness strode into the L.A. bar wearing the smallest black dress she’d brought from home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes scanned the room. She wanted to spot Rio and her group first, so she could then decide her next move. But the lights were dimmed, and the music was loud. The place was packed, full tables covering most of the floor, except for the bar area, where a few women stood on their own ordering drinks. It had only been a few seconds, but Agatha was already tempted to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio found her first, because of course she had to ruin even her smallest plan.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha spent most of her night hanging out with Rio and her friends, Alice and Jen. It turned out, they weren’t that bad, after all. Rio was mostly quiet as the rest of them talked and drank, and Agatha couldn’t figure out why. She was actually trying to be amicable, cracking jokes and following the conversation, even though she honestly didn’t really care. Alice and Jen were a sweet couple, she could admit that. But Alice talked non-stop, and Jen kept looking at Agatha like she was waiting for her to fail some sort of secret test. Meanwhile, Rio remained silent, smiling and offering soft chuckles on cue whenever anyone said something even remotely funny. Agatha tried to shoot her a few quick glances, but Rio didn’t look back at her. Not once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What annoyed Agatha the most, though, was the amount of people, women specifically, coming up to their table. Coming up to Rio, in particular. Throughout the night, more than five women walked towards them and asked Rio to dance, or offered to buy her a drink. Agatha rolled her eyes every time. Rio handled it with grace, smiling kindly before rejecting them. But as each one walked away, Agatha’s patience grew thinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she was being honest, she found it a bit embarrassing how no one was trying to flirt with her, and seeing Rio’s line of women made it sting more. And there was something about watching it all unfold right in front of her eyes that made her skin crawl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So when Agatha saw an opening —Jen and Alice were quieter and closer together now, cuddling— she got up and headed towards the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna go get something to drink,” she said abruptly before walking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked, she flipped her hair away from her face, partly because she figured Rio must’ve been watching, and partly because the woman waiting for her at the bar definitely was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had noticed the redhead looking at her from across the room just when she was starting to grow tired of feeling invisible. The woman was beautiful, her red dress bright enough that whenever she moved, everyone turned to look at her. As Agatha walked to her, she saw that the lace fabric revealed matching red lingerie underneath. A confident smirk tugged at her lips. Maybe Rio wouldn’t be the only one having fun that night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” the woman greeted her as soon as Agatha was close enough to hear. “What are you drinking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever you’re having.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They hit it off immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The redhead —Wanda, as Agatha learned later— was a single mother of two who was spending the holidays in Malibu as well while her ex took care of the children, for once. She was funny, hot, and exactly what Agatha needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They spent the rest of the night talking at the bar. Initially, she had tried to seduce the woman, leaning in, letting her hand fall on Wanda’s leg as she laughed, moving to stand closer to her until their bodies nearly touched. She’d been aware of Rio’s eyes on her at first, but after a few drinks she forgot all about her housemate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An hour later, when she finally turned to their table, Rio was gone.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>As it turned out, Agatha and Wanda were better off as friends. That night, they talked for hours until the owner of the place finally kicked them out. Agatha walked Wanda back to her hotel and, when she leaned in to kiss her, the redhead tried to suppress a chuckle —and failed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Agatha questioned, though she was smiling. Both of them were slightly drunk and fully aware that neither of them would be getting laid that night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha stepped back, they started giggling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, I would kiss you if I didn’t desperately need a friend. But I do,” Wanda said once their laughter faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in agreement. “So friends it is,” she replied in a quiet voice, letting the words settle in her brain. They sounded nice, to her surprise. “I promise I won’t kiss you unless you ask for it,” she added with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They smiled at each other for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Want to grab drinks tomorrow night? Same place, same time?” Wanda suggested, her body turning to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you there, friend,” came Agatha’s reply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So there they were the following night, at the exact same bar. They were sitting next to each other, their nearly empty glasses set on the wooden counter. Maybe it was the two bottles of white wine she and Wanda had shared in the span of an hour, but Agatha suddenly felt the urge to tell the other woman all about her many incidents with her housemate. She started spilling her many problems with Rio —how she’d ruined her vacation by staying in L.A., how their schedules clashed, how often she went out, and how frustratingly attractive she looked the entire time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her cheeks were hot and probably red, but alcohol always turned her into a more lenient and sincere version of herself. And maybe that was going to turn into a problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha got up to take a quick trip to the restroom, she saw her problems. More specifically, she saw how the room started to slowly rotate in front of her eyes, Wanda’s concerned face spinning in the middle of it. She reached out and grabbed the back of her chair, holding on to it as if the ground might crumble beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Wanda said, placing one of her hands rapidly on Agatha’s shoulder to steady her. “I think that’s enough wine for us tonight, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded faintly. She knew she was drunk, knew she needed to get home soon, drink water and collapse into her bed as fast as possible. But something about going back home seemed terrifying, suddenly. She sat down on her stool again, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, hun, don’t worry,” she replied in her most confident voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure you are,” Wanda shot back, rising from her seat and grabbing her purse. “Who can come and give you a ride home?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha blinked at her completely disoriented, Wanda went on. “My hotel is two blocks away, remember? And I’m pretty sure you mentioned your place —Rio’s place, I mean— was a bit far,” Wanda pressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the mention of Rio’s name, Agatha closed her eyes unwillingly and turned her face away from her friend. The mere mention of the name conjured images of bare strong arms, tanned skin peeking out from under a loose shirt, and dark eyes. Dark and deep, so much so that Agatha thought she could stare into them for centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s name had provoked another kind of reaction in Wanda, though. The redhead had heard all about Agatha’s complicated relationship with the woman, but she also knew Rio was the only other person Agatha knew in Malibu. Wanda would deal with the consequences later. Right now, she needed to get Agatha home before the bartender started complaining.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as Wanda grabbed her phone from the table, too hammered to connect the dots and stop the redhead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi? Yes, hi, I’m Wanda, a friend of Agatha’s…” Wanda was speaking on the phone, but Agatha was too focused on downing the rest of her drink in a quick gulp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few seconds, Wanda handed the phone back to her, placing it gently on her hand. She smiled at her apologetically. “I think your ride will be here soon. Please don’t kill me tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could respond and question her friend, the door opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal walked in.</span>

<p>
<span>After several nights of going out and not much sleep, Rio was looking forward to having a peaceful evening staying in. And when she realized Agatha had left, she decided she should take full advantage of the fact she finally had her place to herself. Christmas was close already, merely two days away, so she figured a quiet night of rest would be the perfect antidote to the impending classic holiday chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slow jazz music drifted from the speaker on her nightstand, and a book lay open between her hands while she stretched out on her bed. Rio wanted to make the most out of the rare silence in the house, and savoured the few minutes of quiet. But her brain refused to cooperate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Try as she might, images of Agatha flirting with that redhead kept coming back to her. Agatha, with that woman at the bar, leaning close, smiling, flirting so effortlessly. How stupid had she been, thinking she’d had a shot with that woman? Not only did Agatha dislike her, but she also clearly had no interest in spending more time than necessary with her. While Rio had spent the night refusing advances from women, Agatha had taken the first opportunity to leave their table and go home with somebody else. The memory stinged. It was a blow to Rio’s ego, her confidence shaken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head and forced her eyes back to the words in front of her. The last thing she should’ve been doing was thinking about Agatha Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, sinking deeper into the mattress. And then her phone started ringing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked it up, the sound pulling her from her thoughts. It was late, too late even for Jen or Alice to be calling her. A number she didn’t recognize showed up on her screen. She declined without a second thought. Only a lunatic would call her at 2 a.m., and she was not in the mood for insanity that night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A second went by before the phone was buzzing, again. Same unknown number.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who the fuck—” she muttered before picking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello? Is this Rio…” the voice, a female voice, trailed off, seemingly talking to someone else. “Vidal, right. Is this her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could hear music in the background. Her brows furrowed. She didn’t remember giving her number to anyone when she went out, but maybe one of her few hook-ups had found it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she replied flatly. “Who is this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, you don’t even have her number saved!” the woman exclaimed, sounding more surprised than offended. Before Rio could answer, she went on. “I’m with Agatha, Agatha Harkness, and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio interrupted her as soon as she heard the name coming from the other end. She could not deal with Agatha anymore, or she would end up going insane. “No, listen, it’s late. Tell her next time she can call me herself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman laughed, and Rio felt anger bubbling up. “I would, but she’s so drunk she would probably throw up on my face if I told her that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated for a moment, deciding her next move. She wanted to not care about whatever was going on with Agatha and simply hang up, but something in her chest tugged at her, urging her to ask about her, to know more, to go look for her. No matter how much she told herself she didn’t care, something about Agatha always managed to wedge its way into her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I wouldn’t be asking if I had another choice, but you’re the only person she knows here. I just need you to pick her up and get her safely to your place.” When Rio didn’t immediately reply, the woman added, “Please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, running a hand through her hair to relieve the stress. Agatha Harkness was like a nightmare she could not wake up from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Text me the address,” she finally replied. “I’ll be there in five minutes.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Exactly five minutes later, Rio walked into the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike Agatha the night before, she didn’t hesitate at the door. This was her bar, the bar she and her friends frequented most nights, and she knew it like the back of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She strode toward the bar and, recognizing her instantly, the bartender smiled at her and nodded their head towards the end of the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the second night in a row, Rio’s eyes found Agatha first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older woman sat slouched on a stool, dressed in black jeans and a white button-up, her long wavy hair loosely covering her face. As she approached, Rio noticed the pink on her cheeks, a telltale sign of drunkenness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to find the source of the voice. Walking in her direction —and Agatha’s, for that matter— and holding a glass of water in one of her hands was a woman that Rio couldn’t quite place, although she looked vaguely familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry I dragged you out of bed, I didn’t know who else to call.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right. Agatha’s friend was the same redhead Rio had seen her flirt with the previous night. And they were hanging out. Again. At a bar. And getting drunk.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This is fine. I’m fine</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her left eye twitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio said nothing, the woman offered her free hand. “Wanda Maximoff. Pleasure to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her hand silently and before she could force her brain to come up with a coherent string of words, Wanda was already moving past her to meet Agatha. She took a deep breath in, trying to get a hold of herself, and started again towards the two women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only this time, while Wanda leaned to talk to her, offering what Rio guessed was some kind of explanation, Agatha was looking over the redhead’s shoulder, straight into Rio. And she did not look happy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio stepped closer, Wanda started to step back, meeting her a meter away from where Agatha was sitting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna go now, alright? Thanks for coming,” Wanda said, already slowly walking away from them. “Tell her to call me tomorrow!” she added when she was nearly at the door, raising her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the redhead disappeared through the door, leaving Rio both worried and irritated. She was now standing next to Agatha, who had hidden her face between her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t want her to call you, just so you know,” Agatha whispered from behind her fingers. She rose up unsteadily to face Rio, revealing a couple of undone buttons in her shirt that Rio tried extremely hard not to look at. Her mascara was smudged, tiny specks of black around her eyes, and her lips were tinted with a shade of red. It was messy, but somehow she managed to still look beautiful, Rio thought to herself. It was frustrating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m sure of that,” she replied, a smile tugging at her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed one of Rio’s arms for support as they moved through the empty tables, Rio guiding them towards the door. Rio felt the warmth of her touch burning the skin on her arm, and she felt her face heat up in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked side by side in silence until they reached Rio’s car. She opened the passenger door for the older woman, leaning in to help her buckle the seatbelt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They spent most of the drive in silence as well, Rio sneaking quick glances to her right, checking on Agatha. But the woman was looking out the window, both her hands placed tightly against her knees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took them fifteen minutes, but after what felt like an eternity, Rio finally turned onto her street. Once they were approaching the house, Agatha abruptly turned to her. “Why did you come?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio inhaled sharply and then shrugged, not taking her eyes off the road. “You called.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, like that two-word answer was enough to satisfy her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrived, Rio quickly got out of her seat, rushing to get to Agatha and help her out. The woman stumbled as she descended, clinging to Rio’s arm again, laughing as she did so. As she led them through the house and into the guest bedroom, Rio was painfully aware of every bit of skin where Agata’s hands met her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio walked them through the door, Agatha let go of her and staggered to her bed, plopping down on the mattress while maintaining her satisfied smile. Rio hurried to her, kneeling down in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay? she asked, concern flooding her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again, the sound soft and disarming. It made Rio’s whole body relax, and she looked down, trying to hide the smile growing on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re hot, you know that?” Agatha’s voice was low and teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s head jerked up. Agatha was leaning back, both hands pressed firmly against the bed as she offered an infuriating smile, her eyes following Rio’s expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re drunk,” Rio countered as she got up, putting some distance between them so that the other woman could not see her blushed cheeks. Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> drunk, because Rio was sure she hadn’t meant what she’d said. “Can I trust you to get to bed without dying?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms in front of her chest and pouted. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Rio exhaled, turning to face her. Rio was trying her best to be a responsible adult, but the sight of Agatha pouting and sitting like a demanding child was almost adorable. She could not fight the smile that came back to her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. If you leave, I’ll probably die or something, and then you’ll have to deal with my corpse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at the ceiling, praying for someone to get her out of that room before her entire body went into combustion. “What do you need, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman patted the space next to her on the duvet, her gaze glued on Rio. “Sit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, but before she could even start to argue, Agatha interrupted her, her voice an octave lower. “Sit,” she repeated intently, and something in her tone sent a surge of electricity through Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She complied, sitting down on the bed next to Agatha, close enough that she could catch her if she needed to, but far enough that they weren’t touching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio was next to her, Agatha dramatically buried her head in her hands, her hair falling over. “My head hurts!” she grunted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, and before she could stop herself her fingers were brushing through Agatha’s dark curls, adrenaline rushing through her veins like she was touching the forbidden fruit. Agatha shivered at the touch, and Rio’s hand darted away as though it burned. She had to get a hold of herself, before she ended up doing something she’d regret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I ask you something?” Agatha said, her voice quite as her face became visible again, her eyes once more locked onto Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shut her eyes for a second, bracing herself. The atmosphere in the room seemed charged, a sort of spell making her head feel dizzy, and her heart beat fast. “Sure,” she replied, feigning a composure she definitely did not feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you stop wearing those tight black jeans?” she started. “And the tank tops as well, those are terrible.” When Rio blinked, confused, Agatha shrugged, a deep smirk on her lips. “It’s distracting. Oh, and that vest you’re wearing right now, that needs to go too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, but she was smiling already. How did this woman manage to get a smile out of her whenever she talked?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what you’re saying is, you want me to walk around the house naked?” she replied, raising her eyebrows, her tone playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed at that —an actual, genuine laugh that made her eyes crinkle at the corners. She scooched closer, so that their legs were grazing one another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I meant what I said before,” Agatha murmured, her voice softening and her upper body turned to face the younger woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a tension building on her chest, heat flushing through her body and reaching her gut. She wanted to speak, but her brain could only come up with senseless sentences.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you’re hot.” Agatha’s words hit Rio like a punch. The woman looked away for a second before adding, “Actually, I think you’re gorgeous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her cheeks turning hot and red, but she didn’t look away. Her eyes searched into Agatha’s, looking for signs that she could trust what she was hearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha was simply looking at her, probably the longest she’d paid attention to Rio since she came to Malibu. “I think you’re beautiful” Rio heard herself answer almost in a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s embarrassing,” Agatha taunted, but she was smiling, her face rose-colored.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly. “Shut up,” she said under her breath. She bumped their shoulders together, pushing Agatha away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A quiet settled over them, but soon Agatha was moving even closer to Rio, their faces turned to each other, mere centimeters away. The older woman raised one of her hands, her long fingers grazing the skin on Rio’s jaw. The touch was scorching, leaving a trail of heat in its wake. Agatha’s eyes moved to Rio’s mouth, and Rio mirrored the gesture, her gaze settled onto red lips.Their breaths mixed, and Rio knew it would only take one small move to get her what she’d wanted since they met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Agatha moved forward, Rio ducked her head away. Her heart hammered against her chest, and her thoughts became a clouded chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat, stood up and rushed to the door, purposefully avoiding Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have a goodnight,” she muttered before closing the door behind her. Rio pressed her back against the wooden surface, closing her eyes.</span>

<p>
<span>When Agatha opened her eyes the following morning, her brain protested with a sharp throb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone had drawn the curtains, leaving the room in a soft light, and placed ibuprofen and a glass of water on her nightstand. Agatha didn’t remember doing either of those things, but then again, she didn’t remember much about the previous evening at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stretched to grab her phone, her head pounding head wincing at the brightness of the screen lighting up. A string of texts began pouring in, and she rushed to silence the chiming sounds. There was one message from Lilia, and then almost twenty from Wanda. Rolling her eyes, Agatha turned her phone off, dropped it back onto her nightstand, and closed her eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Memories from the night before started to surface in her mind. She remembered going out with Wanda, hanging out at the bar. And wine. So. Much. Wine. Even thinking about it made her stomach turn. She remembered Wanda leaving, and her being too drunk to leave on her own. She sat right up, her hand instinctively covering her mouth as the details became clearer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was going to kill Wanda Maximoff.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took one of the pills, washing it down with a gulp of water. She couldn’t believe Wanda had left her with Rio, especially after everything she’d told her. Her friend should’ve known better than to leave her wasted and alone with the person who was driving her crazy. But the person she was most pissed at was herself. Agatha hated not being in control, and drunkenly confessing her attraction to her roommate was definitely something she should’ve been able to control. The worst part, though, was not her own admission, or even Rio’s, for that matter. No. The scene that kept replaying in her head was her own leaning in for a kiss —a weak, impulsive mistake, as she could now see— only for Rio to flee the room, a loop stabbing directly at her ego.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She got up, grabbing her phone and hurrying to the en-suite bathroom. As she looked at herself in the mirror, her eyes dark with smudged eyeliner, her cheeks flushing as the memories became sharper, she started replying to Wanda’s numerous texts, cursing her in every language Agatha knew. And that’s when she realized the date.</span>
</p><p>
<span>December 24th.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Christmas’ Eve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not only did Agatha have to face Rio Vidal after their mortifying </span>
<em>
<span>incident</span>
</em>
<span>, but she would also have to spend Christmas Eve on her own, since she refused to talk to Wanda for at least a couple of days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned over the sink, splashing cold water on her face, forcing her brain to wake up. As she combed through her hair, tying it up in something that resembled a bun, she tried to take a few deep breaths, just how Lilia had taught her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could do this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would simply try to evade Rio and, if need be, she could always pretend she didn’t remember whatever had happened between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling slightly more relaxed, Agatha opened her door slowly, checking for any sort of noise that would indicate Rio’s presence nearby. She waited until she felt sure no one was home, and hurried down the corridor towards the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But of course, the universe was against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she turned left on the corner, her fast pace was interrupted by another moving object. Rio’s body, to be more specific, colliding with her with full force.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Rio exclaimed, stumbling back. “Good morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried her best to sound calm, but her eyes seemed intent on focusing anywhere but on Rio’s face. “Good morning,” she muttered, her voice quieter than she’d intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha looked up, she found Rio’s concerned face. The same face she’d had last night, right before—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you feel?” Rio asked, her body fully blocking the entrance to the kitchen. Agatha had no escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a polite smile to her lips. “I’m fine, don’t worry,” she replied. “Thanks for picking me up, by the way. I’m sorry Wanda bothered you, but I appreciate it,” she added, her eyes finally meeting Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger woman seemed to blush at that, offering a sincere, disarming smile. Agatha tried her best to ignore it. “No problem,” Rio said, her smile wide. “It was fun, actually. You talked a lot—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t remember anything about last night, to be honest,” Agatha interrupted, cutting her off. Her tone was casual, but her entire body tensed up. “I called Wanda, and she told me how you came and saved me, but I don’t remember much about what happened after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something flickered behind Rio’s eyes before the woman quickly looked away, something almost like hurt. Her smile had vanished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt something tightening in her chest, a tiny voice in her head —probably Lilia’s— yelling at her. “But I found the ibuprofen on my bedside table, so thanks for that, as well,” she went on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, sure,” Rio said, a newfound harshness in her tone. “Have a good day,” she said before brushing right past Agatha, her shoulder bumping firmly against Agatha’s torso.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her back against the wall. Something almost like guilt settled in her chest as she watched Rio disappear into her own room, the door closing with a loud thud behind her.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>By the time the afternoon sun was beginning its descent, casting a low light into the house, Agatha found herself sitting on the living room couch, the TV playing on mute, a book laying open next to her, and her notebook in her lap. She was trying to focus, to get some work done and write something decent enough she could send to her boss and feel even a tiny bit better about herself. She could not control her relationship with her housemate, but work? Work she could do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But whenever her pen hovered above the blank paper in front of her, Agatha’s hand stopped in the air, that tightness in her chest nagging at her since the morning. Rio had not come out of her room for the entire day, which was unusual for her. Earlier, Agatha had heard a whispered conversation coming from the hall, so Rio’s friends probably knew all about how she’d messed up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, gripping her pen tighter and trying her best to concentrate. And then she heard the rattling sound of a door opening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head snapped up and she found Rio walking down the hallway in her direction, talking on the phone, her voice muffled. She was wearing a gray tank top, and Agatha winced as she remembered how she’d basically begged Rio to stop wearing them in the house because of how unfairly good she looked in them. Now, staring at her, she was reminded of her embarrassing words, her throat closing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Alice, I will,” Rio was saying, her voice soft but tired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hung up when she reached the living room, and stopped at the door frame when she caught sight of Agatha right in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha said, but her voice sounded more like a plea than a greeting. She cleared her throat, but didn’t say anything else. She didn’t know what to say, how to take back what she’d done the night before so they could go back to pretending the other did not exist. Even that would be better than this awkward middle ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped further, stopping just in front of the couch. “Hi,” she replied. Her tone was less severe than it’d been in the morning, but it was still not fully welcoming. Agatha suddenly missed the easy smile Rio used to wear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, uhm,” Rio started, her weight shifting from foot to foot. “Alice, Jen and I are going to spend the night at the bar tonight, so I thought, if you don’t have plans—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood up, abruptly. Pity? She did not want Rio’s pity, not after she’d rejected her. Her face flushed hot, a combination of humiliation and anger building up inside of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please,” she said, her voice laced with hurt, “let’s not pretend like you like me, okay? I know you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, clearly startled by her outburst. “Yes, I do,” she answered quickly, matter-of-factly, taking a step closer to Agatha, her gaze steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing face to face, Agatha felt her pulse rushing, feeling the heat radiating from Rio’s skin. The temperature seemed to rise, the whole world stopping for a second. She could feel her heart hammering against her chest, her hands buzzing with the need to reach out, to close the space that separated them, to touch— </span>
</p><p>
<span>A sudden crack of thunder pulled them out of their trance, the ground beneath their feet seeming to rattle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit!” Rio yelped, jumping back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could not contain her laughter, her body letting go of the tension, thankful for the distraction from their charged moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Scared of some rain, huh?” Agatha taunted, jockinly grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was looking at her, brows raised in defiance, but soon her alarmed expression gave way to a light smile. “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood like that for a moment, smiling at each other as rain started to pour outside, hitting the windows. The warm feeling in Agatha’s chest did not fade, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio started after a beat, “are you coming tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, but only for a second. “Sure, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, then,” Rio nodded, her smile widening. “Go put on some fancy outfit,” she said, turning her body back to the corridor to leave. “And I’ll do my best to avoid tank tops, black jeans, and… what was it? Right, vests.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with her back turned to her, Agatha could hear the smirk in Rio’s voice. Despite herself, her lips curved into a smile, the warmth lingering in the room even after Rio disappeared from view.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>An hour later, Agatha stood in front of the mirror, taking a long look at her reflection. Outside, rain continued to drum against the roof of the house, the rhythm helping to soothe her nerves, even if slightly. She didn’t fully understand </span>
<em>
<span>why </span>
</em>
<span>she was nervous in the first place, but the feeling was beginning to annoy her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s like I want to throw up,” she was saying, her phone resting on the bed behind her. Lilia was on speaker, her voice calming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About?” her friend prompted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything? I don’t know, Lil. Having dinner with her, her friends, knowing they know what I did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had recounted the events from the previous night to her friend. To her surprise, Lilia had not scolded her for being rude or an idiot. Instead, for maybe the first time in their years of friendship, she had said nothing, simply humming in agreement as Agatha talked without interruption.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re aware it sounds like you have a crush, right?” Lilia asked, her tone pointed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze as she was fixing her hair, turning to glare at her phone. “I don’t!” She heard her own voice, coming out too loud, too defensive. She closed her eyes, realizing she sounded like a child, and added, “I just don’t want to feel any worse than I already do about the whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re gonna be just fine, Agatha. Now put on your dress and get out of this room, before you drive both you and me insane, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, Lilia hung up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did as her friend said, slipping on her black dress —the one she’d worn the first time she went out with Rio. It was comfortable enough, sure, but in the back of her mind, Agatha knew she’d chosen it because she had a feeling Rio would enjoy the sight. She took one more look at her reflection, smirking. She looked amazing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha opened the door, Rio was coming out of her room. They both stopped in their tracks, catching each other’s eye, shy smiles tugging at their lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was dressed in a skirt and a matching black button-up, although most of the top buttons were undone. Agatha noticed she wasn’t wearing a bra, and her eyes trailed downwards, from the curve of her collarbone to her breasts. Agatha gaped at her, looking her up and down shamelessly, this time. When her eyes finally reached the other woman’s face, Agatha found a faint rosy flush covering Rio’s cheeks, and the nagging feeling at her stomach grew stronger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Agatha said, her voice almost restless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look… great.” Rio’s voice came out low. She was staring at Agatha, her dark eyes wide, and her mouth slightly parted. Agatha felt her body heating up at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a small laugh, and gestured to the hallway. “Shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After you, my lady,” Rio replied light-heartedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked down the hall, Agatha leading the way, Rio’s phone rang in her hand. Agatha kept moving, not wanting to intrude, but she could still catch snippets of the conversation. Apparently the rain had gotten pretty bad, and something about checking the news? Agatha turned to Rio, who was looking back at her already with the same confused frown. The younger woman gestured towards the TV, and Agatha turned it on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The news anchor was explaining how the heavy rainfall had triggered a mudslide in the city. Roads were blocked, rivers of mud dragging everything in their way. According to the woman on the TV, the damage so far wasn’t catastrophic, but police were urging everyone to stay home for Christmas Eve this year.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, just call me if you need anything,” Rio said before she hung up. She stepped closer to Agatha, slipping her phone into her pocket. “So, that was Jen. The bar is obviously closed tonight, so we can’t do that anymore,” Rio began to explain, sitting down on the couch in a somewhat defeated manner, her shoulders slumping. “And with most roads closed, Jen and Alice can’t come over. I mean, and </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span> can’t leave either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio talked, Agatha watched her worried expression, sensing the anxiety coming from her housemate. She sat on the coffee table in front of her, a sudden urge to help, to make her feel better, coming over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, we’re already dressed up,” she said, but her voice was rigid. She was not used to being the cool and collected one. She was used to Lilia being the voice of reason, and her being an agent of chaos. She tried to soothe her tone. “What I mean is, we can just celebrate here, right? I can cook —or well, it’d be better if you cooked, to be fair, unless you want to get poisoned, and I have a couple of wine bottles hidden in my bedroom…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was rambling, she realized, words spilling out as she nervously tried to come up with a plan to help Rio. But when her eyes settled back on Rio’s face, she saw her worried frown was gone, replaced by a light amused smile on her lips. Agatha shifted in her seat, Rio’s intense gaze unsettling her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or you can do whatever you want, and I’ll stay in my room pretending this is just a regular night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio interrupted her. Her smile was so sweet it was contagious, and soon Agatha found herself returning the gesture. “I’ll cook,” Rio said, standing up. “You grab the wine and set the table.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a beat, Agatha just stared at her, her stomach flipping. “Deal.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>During dinner, Agatha talked incessantly. She was terrified of an awkward silence settling over them, scared of where that could lead them, so she made a point of talking non-stop, basically recounting her entire life story to Rio. She told her about her college experience, how she met her best friend Lilia there, about her current job as a literary critic and reviewer. Agatha tried to describe New York to Rio, knowing she had missed her chance to visit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio mostly listened in silence, asking only a few questions when Agatha seemed to provide insufficient details. It was surprisingly nice, Agatha thought to herself, having someone’s undivided attention. But whenever she stopped, her eyes would catch Rio’s. And the way the other woman looked at her made her stomach do somersaults.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After they were done putting the clean dishes away, Agatha grabbed the unopened bottle of wine —their second that night— while Rio carried their glasses to the living room, setting them on the low table, turning the speaker on so she could play some slow jazz in the background.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat down on the couch, a safe distance separating them. Agatha had run out of things to ramble about, though. The dreaded silence settled over them, each of them taking a sip of their glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio who broke the quiet. “So, can I ask you something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did not dare look at her. She was clinging to her glass with both hands, the coldness calming her nerves. “I don’t know, </span>
<em>
<span>can </span>
</em>
<span>you?” she replied, a desperate attempt at evading a more serious conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, like she had expected deflection from her, and turned to look straight ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a deep breath in, Agatha forced her eyes to meet the other woman. “Ask away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you really not remember anything about last night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach dropped at that. She swallowed, hard. Rio was not looking at her, though, and it made it easier for her to reply with honesty. And the wine, which had already made her tipsy, loosened her tongue as well. The words still seemed to catch in her throat, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I may have lied about that,” she said, pushing through the feeling of embarrassment that washed over her body. “I remember everything, I— I remember what I said,” she added, and that was the moment Rio decided to look at her with a blank expression. “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I was really drunk, and alcohol makes me…brutally honest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded her head, and Agatha could feel her entire face heating up under her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why did you lie, then?” Rio pressed, her body turning on the couch so that she was fully facing Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clicked her tongue, looking away. “I was embarrassed, okay?” she let the words out quietly. She could not believe Rio was making her admit it all. She felt exposed, vulnerable. “I tried to kiss you, you rejected me, so I thought I would try to save me from complete humiliation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha dared to set her eyes on Rio once again, she found the other woman staring at her, a playful smile finally on her lips. A disarming smile that somehow managed to soothe Agatha’s nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding, right? I thought you were trying to spare </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> the embarrassment after I ran away!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha grasped the full meaning of Rio’s words, her lips began forming a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s partially the reason I asked you to join us for dinner tonight,” Rio went on. “I wanted to return the favour, if that makes sense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a second, staring at each other. Rain was still heavily falling outside, the drops hitting the grass on the backyard the only sound in the house. A breeze slipped through the open window in the kitchen, but the air between them felt hot, charged with electricity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up, abruptly, saving them from an eternity of silence. “You want to dance?” she asked, offering her hand out to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older woman chuckled, looking at the hand, the long fingers covered with silver rings. “I’m a shit dancer, so no, thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cocked an eyebrow up. “Come on, I’ll teach you”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was practically begging, and Agatha had not yet mastered the art of resisting Rio Vidal’s smile. So, like the weak woman she was, she sighed before taking the hand, sending a current of sparks down her arm, right to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her up, making Agatha stand up. Not giving her time to process what was happening, Rio pressed her body against Agatha’s, one of her hands placed softly yet firmly on her waist. Instinctively, Agatha rested her hands on the other woman’s shoulders, steadying herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this okay?” Rio said, but her voice came out like a low whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha silently nodded, her eyes looking down to meet Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music was slow, Rio guiding them on the floor, swaying in place. Agatha could feel her heart pounding against her chest, so hard she thought it might break through her ribcage and end up on the floor in front of them. She was acutely aware of Rio’s long fingers holding her in place by her waist, slightly toying with the fabric of her dress. And then, to make matters worse, she felt Rio’s free hand on her lower back, delicately, but dangerously close to her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha´s head was spinning, intoxicated by the combination of alcohol and the adrenaline of having Rio so close to her, so seemingly devoted to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The swirling sensation in her stomach came back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was something making her insides turn upside down. Almost like some sort of devious insect.</span>

<p>
<span>Rio felt like her body might combust at any second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After getting past her initial disappointment at the sudden change of plans, Rio found spending Christmas Eve with Agatha Harkness was a far better idea than she’d initially thought. A great one, actually, she thought as she watched the woman on the opposite side of the dinner table. Agatha seemed intent on telling Rio all about her, speaking animatedly, and Rio had to remind herself to focus, her brain getting distracted as her eyes were drinking in the other woman’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The confession from earlier still played in her mind. Agatha’s admission of her lie regarding the previous night’s incident had only worsened the chaos stirring inside Rio. She was already dangerously attracted to Agatha, but the confession, the vulnerability it entailed, made a surge of warmth run through her body. At dinner, the feeling had been innocent, tender, chaste even.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now? Now, as they swayed together in harmony, dancing in her dimly-lit living room, the feeling of having Agatha’s body pressed flush against hers was turning those feelings into something needier, making her head dizzy. Heat pulsed between Rio’s legs, Agatha’s warm breath against her ear sending shivers down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was trying to keep her hands still, resisting the urge to let them wander lower. But when she looked up and found Agatha’s gaze on her, her blue eyes gone dark with unmistakable hunger, resistance became futile. In a wave of bravery —aided by the numerous glasses of red wine she’d had— she allowed her hand to slide down, just barely grazing the curve of Agatha’s ass. As she did so, she locked her eyes on the other woman’s, her gaze laced with an unspoken challenge, daring. When Agatha smiled, slow and knowing, it felt like permission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasted no time, pushing Agatha backwards, searching for a surface to steady them against.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t about to surrender so easily. Just as Rio was trying to move them, Agatha slid one of her hands up to Rio’s neck, fingers wrapping around the side of her throat. The unexpected touch made Rio’s breath hitch, her pulse thundering under Agatha’s hand. For a moment, they struggled for control, pushing and pulling in a clear fight for dominance. And Rio was willing to let her win, the feeling of Agatha’s thumb digging at the sensitive skin on her neck enough to make her surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her back slam against the wall behind her. She gasped and looked up. A slow smirk curled her lips as she met Agatha’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many times have you thought about this?” Agatha whispered, her hand still pressed firmly against the curve of Rio’s jaw, holding her face in place. “About touching me? Feeling my body against yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio parted her lips, her mouth suddenly dry. “Don’t act like you haven’t thought about it, too,” she muttered, her voice raspy with want as Agatha strengthened her hold over her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a wicked smile, her free hand tracing a path along the bare skin on her shoulders, her touch featherlight and deliberate. Rio watched silently as Agatha’s eyes dropped lower, lingering on her chest. She shuddered under her gaze, heat pooling achingly low in her stomach. Her pulse was racing, and the anticipation was unbearable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And finally, Rio snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could get another teasing word out, Rio surged forward, her lips crashing against Agatha’s. The older woman didn’t hesitate —she kissed her back just as fiercely, their mouths colliding greedily, drinking each other up in hunger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Agathas’s hands were everywhere, roaming over her body like she couldn’t get enough of it. Rio tangled her fingers in Agatha’s hair, pulling her closer, taking the opportunity to deepen the kiss, parting her lips in a silent invitation. And Agatha obliged with no hesitation, her tongue dancing against Rio’s, swiping her lower lip, teasing, claiming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room filled with the sound of ragged breathing and wet, desperate kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her body harder against Rio’s, caging her against the wall. When Rio leaned back just a centimeter to breathe, Agatha followed her, capturing Rio’s lower lip between her teeth, tugging just enough to make Rio whimper. Agatha smiled against her mouth when Rio kissed her, clearly pleased with the reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, Agatha tilted her head back. Their hot breaths mingled between them, their chests heaving up and down in unison. Rio felt aware of every single one of her nerve cells, her body heated and electric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older woman studied her, eyes dark and lidded with desire, her lips parted as she regained her composure. “Are you sure about this?” she murmured, her hands resting innocently on Rio’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “Agatha,” she replied, the name almost like an exhale coming from her lips. “</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all Agatha needed to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately closed the distance between them, their mouths colliding, stealing the air left in Rio’s lungs. Rio gasped, but melted into the kiss without a second thought. It felt desperate and insatiable, neither of them being able to pull back for air. If she had to die asphyxiated by Agatha’s kiss, then so be it, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved her hands to hold onto Agatha’s waist, desperate for more. But as soon as her fingertips met the soft fabric of her dress, Agatha’s hands were grabbing her wrists, pinning them against the wall above her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Breaking the kiss, Agatha stopped to look at her, clicking her tongue. “No touching for you.” Her voice was low. “Not yet, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to complain, but Agatha raised a single brow, a silent dare behind her eyes. Rio swallowed hard and nodded, her hands relaxing under Agatha’s strong grip. Agatha kissed her again, slower this time, dragging it out. As they kissed, she shifted her thigh between Rio’s legs, forcing them apart, pressing her knee against Rio just enough to make her exhale into the kiss. The feeling of Agatha’s bare leg brushing against the sensitive skin on her thighs sent a wave of pulsing heat through her body. She closed her eyes as Agatha’s lips trailed lower, following the line of Rio’s jaw, her hands still holding her in place against the flat surface of the wall. Agatha pressed wet kisses against Rio’s throat and jaw, nibbling at the skin, scraping her teeth against it. Rio tilted her neck, offering herself to Agatha with no hesitation. When Agatha found a sensitive spot just below Rio’s ear, she bit down gently and soothed it with her tongue. Rio shuddered beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No moving,” Agatha warned against her skin, her tone commanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered but obeyed, her fingers scratching the wall behind her as Agatha released her wrists to hold her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands trailed upwards, ghosting over her ribs, her mouth still attached to Rio’s jaw. She reached Rio’s breasts and cupped them gently over her shirt, her thumbs swiping over hardened nipples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and tilted her head back against the wall, the feeling overwhelming, arching instinctively into her touch as a strangled moan slipped from her lips. She squirmed as she felt Agatha’s knee press harder against her, making her suddenly aware of how wet her underwear was already. The heat between her legs was becoming unbearable, her body pulsing with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha” she groaned, hips rolling in search of more friction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman chuckled and rolled one of her nipples between her thumb and her index finger, eliciting a loud moan from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed light kisses at the corner of Rio’s mouth. “What?” she asked, her voice full of mocked innocence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she pulled back just enough to show a smirk planted on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take your shirt off,” Agatha ordered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did as she was told, tugging her shirt off without bothering to undo the buttons. She felt her cheeks flush hot at the sudden lack of coverage, her bare chest exposed to Agatha. She was about to turn her face away, self-consciously, when Agatha held her head in place, her hand firm on her chin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A heavy exhale left her lips as Agatha leaned in, pressing slow, open-mouthed kisses to her shoulder, her collarbone, her chest, leaving a path of wet marks on her skin. Finally, Agatha’s mouth closed around one of her breasts, her tongue drawing painstakingly slow circles around it, flicking her tongue against her nipple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moan escaped from Rio’s lips, the sound of Agatha’s name tumbling out like a desperate plea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed against her in delight, sucking on her breast, and when she bared her teeth, scraping ever so lightly, a sharp, helpless cry escaped Rio’s throat, a wave of pleasure coming over her. Her hands went to Agatha’s shoulders, gripping her tightly, and this time Agatha did not push them away. Rio’s hips jerked forward, seeking for relief against Agatha’s thigh still firmly pressing against her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha, please,” Rio groaned, practically begging, urgency threading through every word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pursed her lips, clearly amused at the whine in Rio’s tone. “So polite, Vidal,” she purred as her lips left her chest, her face once again at Rio’s eye level. “What do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes in exasperation, defiantly refusing to let Agatha see just how bad she needed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Use your words,” Agatha continued, her mouth whispering in Rio's ear, “or I’ll have to let you finish by yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio inhaled and bit down her bottom lip, feigning annoyance. But the thrumming within her body revealed just how much she was enjoying Agatha’s whole act.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, fuck me, Agatha” she said, making sure the words were crystal clear as they left her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s better,” Agatha murmured, her breath hot against Rio’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved one of her hands down Rio’s body, her fingertips brushing her ribcage, her waist, until they settled over the fabric of her skirt. Rio breathed in, the anticipation making her heart drum against her chest. Agatha kept moving, a single digit tracing a path over Rio’s skirt until she reached its hem. She tugged, gently, before slipping her hand underneath it, her hand squeezing her leg, roaming until she found the sensitive area on the inside of her thigh, her nails scraping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There?” Agatha asked, her mouth dangerously close to Rio’s, her touch lingering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breathed in, her gaze locked on Agatha’s dark blue eyes. “No,” she managed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head as her fingers trailed higher up, finding the edge of Rio’s underwear. “There?” she repeated the question, clearly not satisfied with the previous answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio replied, her breath catching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly. “Show me, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio straightened her neck, hesitant, her eyes finding Agatha’s, looking for clarification. The other woman simply raised an eyebrow, her fingers still playing with the hem of the underwear. Slowly, she reached down, her hand settling over Agatha’s. She grabbed onto it, guiding it higher. The moment Agatha’s fingertips brushed against her center over the fabric of her underwear, Rio’s breath hitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a good girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s words slammed into her, her body jolting at the praise. Rio rolled her hips against the woman’s hand, chasing after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Agatha,” Rio whimpered, her hand forcing Agatha’s to stay there, where she needed her the most.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha placed two fingertips against her, applying just enough pressure to make Rio shudder. “You’re soaked, Vidal,” she murmured, her mouth ghosting over Rio’s as she spoke. “Move your hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed instantly, her entire body pulsing with hunger. She tensed as she felt Agatha’s hand on  her, pushing the soaked fabric to the side. Her fingers trailed along her, gathering the slickness between them, her knee still settled between Rio’s legs, pushing them farther apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she felt Agatha’s fingers on her, bare and direct, Rio groaned, a current of electricity flowing through her body. Agatha dragged her long fingers along Rio, softly at first. She pressed harder then, her fingertips placed strategically against Rio’s entrance, teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so wet for me, Vidal,” Agatha hummed, a playful smirk dangling from her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned, her body twitching, barely able to stand up straight on Agatha’s hand. “I need you, inside,” Rio murmured, burying her flushed face on the other woman’s neck, inhaling her scent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you now, huh?” Agatha replied coyly, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, abruptly, she slid a single digit inside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A strangled groan tore from Rio’s lips against Agatha’s neck, her hips moving involuntarily against Agatha’s hand. Agatha moved deliberately slowly, her thumb grazing the sensitive and swollen bundle of nerves at Rio’s center, eliciting curses from the younger woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, Agatha, just fuck me already.” Rio’s voice dropped an octave. She felt the blood rushing through her entire body, unable to take the teasing movements for much longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was ready to comply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman added a second finger then, picking up the pace as Rio’s moans became more desperate, her breathing ragged against the crook of Agatha’s neck. Agatha clearly knew what she was doing, her fingers sliding in and out rapidly, curling them in just the right way, her thumb working her clit. Rio whined, biting down on Agatha’s shoulder to muffle her cries. She slipped a hand around Agathas’s waist, her fingers reaching up her dress until her nails were digging against the bare skin on her back, leaving faint, crescent-shaped marks. Rio rolled her hips against Agatha’s hand, chasing the rush, and Agatha held her steady, the hand around her waist keeping her exactly where she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it,” Agatha murmured, her voice rough. “You’re being so good for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled herself closer to Agatha, her nails scratching harshly at her back as she held on, Agatha’s mouth on her earlobe, biting gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m—” she gasped, unable to finish her sentence, the feeling of Agatha’s fingers in her too much, too good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, sensing how close she was, Rio’s walls pressing against her fingers. She tilted her head back, her fingers curling inside of Rio. Rio’s free hand grabbed onto Agatha’s shoulder, pressing herself harder against the other woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just when Rio was nearing the edge, Agatha tilted her head back, her other hand going to Rio’s hair, grabbing her and forcing her to meet her gaze. “Let me see you come, Vidal,” Agatha said under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fixed her eyes onto Agatha’s, and she could feel the other woman’s heart beating hard, her breathing accelerated as well as she kept her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair. Knowing she could have this effect on Agatha turned her even more on. Rio made sure she kept her gaze on Agatha’s as the woman fucked her harder and faster, her lips parted as she exhaled heavily. Rio threw her head back as she came, her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, drowning in dark blue, her legs shaking violently and threatening to let her fall onto the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha kept her in place, her hand leaving Rio’s hair to hold her waist again, her fingers now slowly moving against her and finally sliding out of her as Rio tried to get her breathing under control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without breaking eye contact, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, holding it up. Her long fingers glistened against the soft lights of the living room, and Rio felt a rush of arousal. As Agatha watched her intently, her gaze darkened further, her lips slightly parted, Rio brought the hand to her lips, her tongue dragging along the length of Agatha’s fingers, licking them clean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Merry Christmas to me,” Rio said, a taunting smile already on her lips as she let go of Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, her blue eyes wide, her breath unsteady. Before Rio could add another snarky remark, Agatha surged forward, kissing her hard. She pushed against her with greed, her tongue sliding into Rio’s mouth, her fingers digging into Rio’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned softly into her lips, heat rushing through her at the force of Agatha’s kiss, their lips moved against each other in sync. She returned it, pressuring, her tongue teasing against Agatha’s, arousal growing back within her. Rio grinned against Agatha’s mouth and broke away just enough to murmur, “So impatient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, and before she could reclaim Rio’s lips, Rio placed both hands on Agatha’s shoulders, pushing her firmly backwards and towards the couch. Agatha raised an eyebrow curiously but didn’t resist, allowing herself to be guided to the sofa until the back of her legs bumped against it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a sly smile, her tongue pressed against the inside of her cheek. Then, with an intentional push, she forced Agatha to sit down on the couch in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha whispered, a hint of warning in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio had already dropped to her knees in front of her, and any further protest died on Agatha’s lips. Instead, she opened her legs with no hesitation, her dress hiking up slightly, inviting the other woman to settle between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her through her lashes. Agatha was watching her closely, her pupils gone dark with hunger, her hands carefully placed on her sides, gripping the sofa, fingers curled into the fabric. The sight alone sent a wave of arousal coursing through Rio’s trembling body, making her press her thighs together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All she could think about was making Agatha feel good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s legs, the tips of her fingers brushing over her calves before tracing a path upwards, smirking as she reached her thighs. She moved with intention, her touch light, teasing. As she reached Agatha’s Agatha’s lower back, she applied more pressure, gripping her firmly. Then, she pulled her forward, forcing her to sit closer to the edge of the sofa, closer to her. Agatha gasped at the sudden movement, her chest heaving up and down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel the heat radiating from Agatha’s body, her muscles tensed with anticipation. It made her mouth water, knowing she was the one working her up like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pushing Agatha’s dress higher up, Rio let the fabric gather on the woman’s lap until she was able to lay her eyes right between Agahta’s legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Black, lacy, and sheer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sight was enough to knock the air from Rio’s lungs. Her lips parted as she curled her fingers against the waistband, and she had to bite down her bottom lip to stifle a groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dark, barely-there lace, teasingly transparent —it was sinful, and it sent a wave of arousal straight to her core, her pupils blown wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up to meet Agatha’s eyes, seeking permission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“May I?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, the sound deep and entertained. Without a word, she lifted her hips, giving Rio exactly what she wanted. And Rio didn’t hesitate. She pulled, dragging the fabric down Agatha’s legs before tossing it to the side. The moment Agatha spread her legs again, Rio inhaled sharply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was wet. Soaked, actually, the curls on her center glistening right before Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A deep, aching hunger twisted in Rio’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time since she’d met her, Agatha was silent. No orders, no teasing remarks, just charged anticipation thrumming in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It caught Rio off guard for a moment, but as soon as she leaned in, her tongue meeting heated flesh, all her doubts melted away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck!” Agatha groaned, her head falling back against the couch, closing her eyes sharply. Rio looked up at her from between her legs and smiled, proud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, she did it again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand flew to Rio’s head, her fingers tangling in her hair, guiding back towards her, holding her in place. Rio complied eagerly, her mouth closing gently over Agatha. Rio’s tongue began tracing slow, deliberate circles over Agatha’s center, adding pressure whenever she heard a moan escape from Agatha’s lips. Agatha’s grip tightened, her nails scraping against Rio’s scalp, keeping her where she wanted her. Each flick, each stroke, each added bit of pressure was met with loud moans and curses. Rio’s eyes trailed up, finding Agatha staring back at her, her mouth agape as she let out screams that grew louder and louder as Rio dragged her tongue along her folds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was unraveling under her, and Rio felt herself grow wetter just from the sounds alone. Rio inhaled, drunk with the taste of Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tilted her head slightly, angling herself better, and flattened her tongue against Agatha’s clit, dragging it firmly before sucking it between her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp, breathless cry, one hand grabbing at the fabric of the sofa, the other holding Rio in place, gripping her harder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned against her in response, and the vibration made Agatha buck her hips against her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, don’t stop,” Agatha gasped, her voice wrecked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her pulse quicken as Agatha rolled her hips desperately against her mouth, her eyes snapping shut. She could no longer feel her knees hitting the floor, and she didn’t care. All that mattered was Agatha, how good she felt in her mouth, how loud she was screaming. Rio felt another orgasm building up between her legs, and she chased it, drinking Agatha up. She tightened her grip on Agatha’s thighs, her fingers pressing into the soft skin, keeping the woman in place as she lapped at her mercilessly, Agatha’s hips rolling against her hungrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sucked Agatha’s clit, causing a surge of uninhibited gasps and screams coming from Agatha. She kept her lips closed over the bundle of nerves, her teeth grazing the skin. She watched as the woman opened her eyes, the deep blue meeting her gaze, her grip on Rio’s hair shaky. Agatha’s entire body was trembling now, her thighs shaking on either side of Rio’s head. Her nails bit into Rio’s scalp, but she didn’t care. She wanted to push Agatha over the edge, wanted to see her fall apart completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And finally, Agatha did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cry was guttural, raw, her back arched, her fingers tightening painfully in Rio’s hair. Rio followed her, keeping her mouth over Agatha’s cunt as she came on her knees. Her thighs clenched around Rio’s head, locking her in as she rode out her orgasm, her body convulsing under its force. She tried to drag Agatha’s orgasm, her tongue licking the slickness between her folds, her chin wet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t stop, dragging their climaxes, her tongue gathering the slickness between Agatha’s folds, her own chin wet. Her movements slowed down as she allowed Agatha to ride it out. Finally, Agatha tugged on Rio’s hair, pulling her back. Rio bit down a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio licked her lips and looked up. Agatha looked disheveled, her hair messy around her face, her cheeks burning red, her blue eyes gone dark, pupils blown wide, her chest rising and falling rapidly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted herself up on her knees between Agatha’s legs, and soon the woman’s mouth was on hers again, tasting herself on Rio’s lips. Rio moaned against her, kissing her back slowly as she regained her composure. When Agatha leaned back, breaking the kiss, Rio stood up to sit on the coffee table in front of Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the other woman was already standing up, her hands pulling her dress down to regain some semblance of composure. Agatha leaned down, her mouth hovering next to Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come to bed with me,” she whispered, her breath still hot, her voice raspy and agitated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words sent a shiver down Rio’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did not have to say it twice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jumped to her feet and followed Agatha to her room.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On Christmas morning, Agatha woke up to the sound of rain. The rhythmic pattering against the windows filled the room, mingling with the soft hum of her own breathing. She blinked, slowly, adjusting to the dim light filtering through the blinds, and shifted against the pillows. She felt a warmth against her she didn’t recognize.</p><p>A body.</p><p>Frowning, she leaned back, her head resting against the wall as memories from the night before came rushing back to her brain. Her gaze drifted to the figure sprawled across the mattress.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The sight made her expression soften.</p><p>Rio’s bare legs were tangled awkwardly in the sheets, one arm hanging off the bed, the other resting between them. Her dark hair was messy, strands falling across her face as she slept soundly, completely unbothered by the uncomfortable position she had twisted herself into. Agatha watched her in silence, her eyes tracing the gentle rise and fall of her stomach barely visible under the thin fabric of her white cami, moving upward to her chest, her neck, the curve of her lips.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corner of Agatha’s mouth. A warm, unfamiliar and consuming feeling flooded through her.</p><p>She shifted on the mattress, and the small movement was enough to stir Rio.</p><p>Rio scrunched her nose, mumbling unintelligibly as she blinked sleepily. Her lashes fluttered, her dark eyes adjusting to the morning light before landing on Agatha.</p><p>The second their gazes met, Rio’s lips curled into a soft, drowsy smile.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks reddening. She returned the smile, hesitant yet genuine. “Good morning.”</p><p>Before she could fully register what was happening, Rio was sitting up, leaning in. Her lips brushed against Agatha’s —soft, unhurried, lingering. A stark contrast to the kisses they’d shared the night before.</p><p>This was different. Gentler. More dangerous.</p><p>Agatha sighed into the kiss, her fingers instinctively finding Rio’s waist, pulling her closer. She could feel the heat radiating from Rio’s skin beneath her fingertips, could feel the way her body melted into the warmth of the other woman.</p><p>Rio hummed against her lips, the sound vibrating through Agatha’s chest as she felt the woman’s thumb brush against her cheek. Then, Rio pulled back just enough to rest her head on her hand, her pillow cradling her elbow.</p><p>She was staring at Agatha again.</p><p>Dark eyes locked onto her, her smile lingering on her face.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her pulse thrumming against her throat. Unable to bear the weight of Rio’s gaze, she turned away, fixing her stare on the wall across the room.</p><p>“Why do you do that?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, Rio’s voice pulling her back.</p><p>She shifted under the sheets, her fingers unconsciously pulling the blanket higher over her chest, covering herself up. “What do you mean?” she asked, turning back to face the younger woman.</p><p>Rio was smirking, seemingly entertained by Agatha’s awkwardness. “Turn away. Hide.” Her tone was amused, but there was a softness underneath, an honest curiosity. “Why?”</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly.</p><p>She wanted to look away again. She wanted to avoid the conversation, to brush it off with a witty remark and a roll of her eyes.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, she exhaled, letting a smile form on her lips.</p><p>It was almost like magic, how easy it was for Rio to pull it out of her, and how impossible it was for her to resist it.</p><p>“I don’t know…” she started, her voice barely above a whisper. “I feel nauseous when you look at me. It makes my stomach twist and turn.” She frowned.  “It’s weird.”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted, her smile stretching wide and wicked. “Are you saying I make you nervous?”</p><p>She sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling with amusement, the corners crinkling as she grinned.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and scoffed. “Shut up.”</p><p>But Rio only laughed, and despite herself, Agatha’s smile grew wider.</p><p>Her body relaxed against the sheets, her shoulders losing their ever-present tension.</p><p>Rio was still watching her, dark eyes warm, patient. And it no longer felt suffocating.</p><p>It felt almost nice. </p><p>Rio stretched, then threw the blanket off to hop out of bed, holding out her hand. “Come on, I’ll make you some breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only half a second before slipping her hand into Rio’s.</p><p>She let Rio pull her up and into Christmas.</p><hr/><p>They spent the rest of the morning on the couch, their bodies pressed together, their legs tangled lazily over the coffee table as rain drummed softly against the windows. The television flickered in front of them, playing a movie neither of them was really watching.</p><p>Agatha had an arm draped over Rio’s shoulder, and Rio, nestled against her side, absentmindedly played with the loose curls of Agatha’s hair, twisting the strands between her fingers.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze fixed on the screen, but her mind was elsewhere, the movie they were watching long forgotten. She felt every gentle tug, every accidental pull of her curls, the soft brush of Rio’s fingertips against her skin. She was hyper aware of the warmth radiating from the woman beside her, they way Rio’s legs pressed against her own.</p><p>Last night, with Rio, it had been… probably the best sex Agatha had had in years. Maybe in her entire life, if she was being honest. But that wasn’t what had her pulse quickening, what had her chest tightening in a way she refused to name.</p><p>Because whatever had been growing inside her for the past few days wasn’t just lust —it wasn’t just the undeniable, allconsuming attraction between them. It was something gentler, steady. A quiet feeling that reminded her of the kiss they’d shared that morning.</p><p>And it terrified her.</p><p>The buzz of Rio’s phone interrupted her thoughts, the screen lighting up with Alice’s name and photo. Rio huffed in feigned annoyance, grabbing the remote to pause the movie before answering.</p><p>“Hey, weirdo,” she greeted, her tone light.</p><p>Agatha turned from her, trying to offer some sort of privacy. As Rio talked, Agatha’s thoughts went inevitably back to Rio, back to them.</p><p>As much as she hated to admit it, Rio was right. She did make her nervous. But it wasn’t just nerves. It was something much more intoxicating. Being near Rio was a rush, charged and electric, like holding on to a live wire, the instinct to act stronger than all rational thoughts.  It was intense and passionate at times, making Rio addictive. And then, like a switch that had been pressed, her presence could bring a sense of peace Agatha had never known. And she was willing to let herself become addicted to it, to her, if it meant she could keep feeling like that for even a bit longer.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, pressing her fingers to her temple.</p><p>She was in trouble.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s voice pulled her back and she turned, glancing down at the woman still curled against her side. “Yes, sorry,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio tilted her head towards her phone, already abandoned on the coffee table. “Alice says the roads are opening again, and she and Jen are having a few people over for dinner. She’s wondering if maybe you wanted to join us.”</p><p>Agatha watched her carefully, noticing how Rio’s gaze flickered from her to the TV, then back again to her. She was nervous as well, Agatha realized. It was endearing, and it made her own anxieties settle a bit.</p><p>In spite of herself, Agatha smiled tenderly. “Yeah, sounds great,” she replied, her hand moving without thought to fix a loose strand of Rio’s dark hair behind her ear.</p><p>Rio lifted her eyes, following the motion, her breath catching as Agatha’s fingers barely brushed her face. Their gazes locked, and for a moment, neither of them moved.</p><p>Agatha watched the way Rio’s lips parted, the way her chest rose and fell just a little quicker. A faint blush crept onto her cheeks, and against all better judgement, Agatha let her thumb brush over the softness of Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whispered, a trace of warning laced in her tone.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. She was playing with fire.</p><p>Before she could do something reckless—like kiss her, or worse, admit just how much she wanted to—Agatha forced herself to look away, tearing her gaze from Rio’s lips, from the confusion flickering in her dark eyes.</p><p>She needed to get a hold of herself. To stop acting like some love-struck idiot over a meaningless crush. Because that was all it could be. A short-lived fling.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself to her feet, stepping away from the couch, away from the warmth of Rio’s body.</p><p>“I’m going to get some sleep,” she said, her voice steady.</p><p>Rio blinked at her, unmoving.</p><p>Agatha turned to the hallway before she could second-guess herself. “Come get me when it’s time to leave, okay?”</p><p>And with that, she walked away, her head high.</p><p>She didn’t dare look back.</p><p>Because if she did, she was afraid she might run straight back into her arms.</p><hr/><p>A couple of hours later, Agatha was following Rio across her front porch towards her SUV, the sharp clack of her heels against the scattered cobblestones barely audible over the rain. The storm hadn’t fully passed, a steady drizzle misting the air.</p><p>Agatha was trying —really, genuinely trying— to be respectful. But her eyes were glued onto Rio’s ass in front of her, those sinful black jeans once again forcing all rational thoughts away from Agatha’s brain.</p><p>They had yet to talk about the previous night. They weren’t really talking, exactly, not since they’d had breakfast together in the morning and Agatha had been dangerously close to doing everything but proposing to Rio over a plate of scrambled eggs. Which was insane. Completely and utterly insane. She had to behave like a normal person. Had to stop this ridiculous crush before things got messy.</p><p>Except right now, sitting beside Rio as they drove in silence to Alice and Jen’s place, all Agatha could think about was how badly she wanted to kiss her again. How she wanted to hold her face, to feel the muscles on her arms tense under her hands.</p><p>Restraint had never been Agatha’s strong suit. And apparently, when it came to Rio Vidal, it was entirely nonexistent.</p><p>So when Rio sent a quick glance her way, the ghost of a smile lingering on her lips, Agatha decided she could handle it. She had to.</p><p><em> It’s just sex </em> , she thought. <em> It can be just sex </em>, she kept repeating to herself in her head. She could do it. And she had to prove it to herself that she could control it.</p><p>Keeping her eyes on the road straight ahead, Agatha allowed one of her hands to drift from where it was neatly folded in her lap, her fingers landing lightly on Rio’s leg, just above her knee.</p><p>Immediately, the younger woman shot her a confused glance. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, nonchalant, her expression unreadable. “Nothing. Just keep driving.”</p><p>But as the words left her lips, her hand started their slow ascent, tracing a lazy path upward over the rough denim. The sharp inhale Rio took when Agatha’s fingertips brushed against the inside of her thigh made her smirk. A pretty blush bloomed across Rio’s cheeks.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio said, her voice low, edged with warning.</p><p>Agatha ignored her, her thumb rubbing small circles against Rio’s inner thigh, fingers pressing gently into firm muscle. Agatha watched intently, studying her reactions. Rio gripped the steering wheel firmly and pressed her thighs close together, her foot pushing harder on the accelerator.</p><p>And when Agatha’s fingertips grazed between her legs, finding Rio’s center, Rio finally turned to her, an incredulous frown on her face.</p><p>“Are you trying to get us killed?” she asked, her voice serious.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha replied innocently.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose, gripping the wheel so tightly her knuckles turned wait, and she turned to face the road again. “I will literally drive us into the fucking ocean if you don’t stop.”</p><p>But when she glanced Agatha’s way, her composure wavered.</p><p>Because Agatha was smirking, a devilish grin on her face.</p><p>And then, with slow, deliberate pressure, she pressed two fingers harder against Rio’s core.</p><p>Rio shut her eyes for half a second, clearly agitated.</p><p>Then, finally, and inevitably, her legs parted, just slightly.</p><p>“Then pull over,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice.</p><p>She found a secluded spot off the highway and parked the car behind a small mound of rocks and bushes. It was late, and the sun was already setting down, the mild darkness and the rainfall allowing them more privacy.</p><p>As soon as Rio pulled the handbrake, Agatha started moving.</p><p>Her fingers curled under Rio’s jaw, tilting her face up, mouths colliding in a feverish, urgent kiss, their lips moving like it was muscle memory. Rio brought her hands to Agatha’s wrists, holding her closer to her, anchoring her in place.</p><p>Their movements were slower this time, more deliberate. A simmering, aching hunger rather than frantic desperation. Like they knew they had all the time in the universe, like the world could burn around them and it wouldn’t matter.</p><p>Rio leaned back, her head hitting the seat, eyes flickering to the ceiling as she struggled to catch her breath. “We need to get to the party,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows, a cocky grin on her face. “I can be quick.”</p><p>When Rio didn’t protest any further, Agatha lifted herself off her seat, gracefully climbing onto Rio’s lap. The driver’s seat was cramped, but Agatha made it work, her knees pressing into the edges of the cushion, locking Rio beneath her.</p><p>She paused, just for a second. She searched Rio’s face for hesitation —for doubt. Because Agatha wanted this.</p><p>More than that, she needed it.</p><p>Because if she could sleep with Rio without her heart bursting open with warm, terrifying feelings, then she would be okay.</p><p>Or so she was trying to tell herself.</p><p>But when Rio finally met her gaze, there was no trace of hesitation, no uncertainty.</p><p>Her big dark eyes were inviting, her lips already stained with Agatha’s lipstick.</p><p>It was all the permission Agatha needed.</p><p>She leaned in, her mouth colliding against Rio’s, her hands tangling in dark hair, tilting Rio’s face up as she kissed her deeper, harder.</p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into Agatha’s waist, gripping her like she was afraid to let go. Agatha slid her tongue into her mouth, her lips parted like an invitation. Whenever Agatha leaned back, teasing, Rio chased her lips with a greediness that sent shivers down her spine.</p><p>Agatha bared her teeth, nipping Rio’s bottom lip and tugging just enough to make her moan, rough and needy. The sound sent a wave of arousal to Agatha’s stomach. When Agatha’s hands slid down, her fingers pressing against Rio’s jawline, she leaned back far enough to break the kiss, but staying close enough that their ragged breaths mingled between them.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss on Rio’s neck, feeling her rushing pulse under her lips.</p><p>“I thought I’d told you to stop wearing these jeans…” she murmured against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“And I didn’t really care,” Rio replied, the amused smirk on her face enough to drive Agatha insane with need. “What are you going to do about it?”</p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to meet her gaze. “Oh, I have a few ideas in mind,” she hummed before dragging her tongue along the line of Rio’s neck, reaching her jaw, the skin taut under her touch.</p><p>She watched as Rio closed her eyes, a slow exhale dropping from her lips, her head tipping back, exposing more of her throat to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“People could see us” Rio muttered, weakly, seemingly protesting, though the way her hands gripped Agatha’s waist indicated the opposite.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her lips curling into a wicked smile. “And you would love that, wouldn’t you, Vidal?”</p><p>As she spoke, Agatha brought one of her hands down to Rio’s waist, her fingers playing with feign innocence with the button of those too-tight jeans.</p><p>Agatha leaned away, her back pressed against the wheel, watching Rio with a satisfied smirk.</p><p>“Take your shirt off,” she ordered.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She grabbed the hem and yanked it over her head, tossing it into the backseat without a second thought.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her pulse spiking.</p><p>As her fingers skillfully undid the button of Rio’s jeans, Agatha pressed her free hand to Rio’s ribs, her eyes locked onto the golden expanse of her skin, her toned stomach, the perfect curve of her breasts beneath a simple black bra. Her mouth fell slightly open, breath hitching, desire thrumming through her body, her fingertips grazing the warm, soft skin.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, the words slipped from her lips, barely a whisper.</p><p>“God, you’re so beautiful.”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply, the sound shaking Agatha out of her trance. She looked up, meeting Rio’s wide, dark eyes, her own face flushed.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, but before she could speak, Agatha leaned in, not letting the words fall from her lips. She couldn’t. Whatever Rio was about to say, Agatha was sure it would ignite those feelings she was trying so desperately to ignore. And she wasn’t willing to take that risk.</p><p>Instead, she kissed her with force.</p><p>Her fingers worked Rio’s zipper down as their lips moved together, and she allowed her hand to slide into Rio’s jeans, her fingers trapped between the denim fabric and the heat of her underwear. The moment Agatha pressed two fingers against her, Rio broke the kiss with a gasp, her head snapping back against the seat’s headrest, a sharp hiss escaping from within her.</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself, her pulse hammering, the warm slickness on Rio’s underwear making her head spin.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio murmured, her voice breathy, unsteady.</p><p>Hearing her own name like that —like a plea, like something much heavier than it should be— made Agatha feel lightheaded. Her stomach turned, her breath caught, and for a split second, that unbearable tenderness threatened to mix with her arousal.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t let that happen.</p><p>All Agatha could do to shut those emotions off was press the tips of her fingers more firmly against Rio’s clit over the soaked fabric of her underwear, a devious smile planted on her face, her idiotic feelings cast aside.</p><p>Rio groaned, her body arching into Agatha’s touch, her lips parting on a sigh as she buried her face against Agatha’s neck. “<em> Fuck </em>,” Rio murmured, pressing her lips to Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself to lean into Rio’s mouth, let herself sink into the heat of her body.</p><p>She felt Rio tug at the hem of her blouse and she pulled back just long enough to let her pull it over her head, revealing her bare breasts to her. She’d decided against wearing a bra tonight, and the sharp inhale Rio took at the sight told her it’d been the right choice.</p><p>She watched Rio watch her, eyes dark, jaw clenched, and she relished feeling so wanted, feeling how desperate to touch her Rio was.</p><p>“Are you going to touch me or are you just going to stare at my tits forever?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, the air escaping from her lips hot against Agatha’s face. “Shut up.”</p><p>And before Agatha could tease her further, Rio ducked her head, her mouth on her chest, her mouth closing over a nipple, moaning against her, her tongue circling and flicking.</p><p>Agatha was caught off guard, her head snapping back as a guttural groan was ripped from the back of her throat. She barely had time to recover before Rio’s lips moved to her other breast, her teeth grazing sensitive flesh, her hand on Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Fine. Two could play this game.</p><p>With Rio’s lips sucking on her other breast, Agatha pushed her hand past the waistband of Rio’s underwear, her fingers slipping against her wet folds. It wasn’t a comfortable position, but Agatha was so desperate she didn’t even care if her fingers snapped.</p><p>The moment she touched her, Rio groaned loudly, her hips instinctively rolling against Agatha’s hand. She bared her teeth, catching a nipple between them, drawing a curse from Agatha’s lips as her eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>Rio pulled back, and Agatha shifted on her lap, sitting taller. Their faces hovered close, her loose curls falling around them like a curtain, closing them off from the rest of the world. Agatha kept her gaze on the younger woman, her fingers trailing over her folds, exploring through her wetness. A shiver ran through Rio’s body when Agatha’s fingertips grazed her clit.</p><p>“I need—” Rio’s breath hitched, her chest rising and falling against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her touch slow. “What, <em> honey </em>?”</p><p>Agatha caught the moment the pet name registered in Rio’s brain, the way her pupils dilated, her cheeks flushed a hot red. Her lips parted as if to respond, but no word came. And Agatha —God, Agatha wanted nothing more than to kiss her, to melt into her, to let Rio take her apart piece by piece.</p><p><em> No </em> , she reminded herself. <em> Just sex. No weird, confusing feelings </em>.</p><p>She pressed harder against Rio, the tips of her fingers hovering at the edge, teasing, drawing another gasp from Rio.</p><p>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver, her head tilting back, following Agatha’s every movement. “Please,” she murmured, her voice strained. “I need to touch you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a knowing, confident smile. She grabbed Rio’s hand and guided it to the zipper of her own jeans, silently granting permission. Rio didn’t hesitate, her hand breaking free from under Agatha’s guidance, undoing the zipper, and slipping under the older woman’s underwear, her target clear. The moment Rio finally touched her, Agatha pushed inside, feeling Rio pulse and tense around her fingers.</p><p>They moaned, their hips rolling and grinding against one another, seeking for more friction, for relief, a desperate rhythm building between them. Soon, Rio’s fingers were inside Agatha as well, and she pushed deeper in return, their bodies in perfect syntony, picking up a faster pace. Agatha leaned in for a kiss, but her head was forced back when Rio grabbed her ass and added another finger, forcing a breathless cry from Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” she gasped, her breath shaky, leaning back in to capture Rio’s lips between hers, hungrily kissing her.</p><p>Agatha pressed deeper, and Rio followed her lead, her thumb draggin over Agatha’s clit with agonizing precision. Agatha tilted her head back, her mouth agape as silent pleas escaped her lips, but Rio was relentless. She trailed her lips along Agatha’s jawline, leaving a trail of kisses down her neck, sucking and biting at the soft pale skin, marking her.</p><p>“Are you seriously giving me a fucking hickey?” Agatha said, though her voice was barely a rasp, almost incoherent.</p><p>Rio pulled back to meet her gaze, a gleam in her eyes that drove Agatha insane.</p><p>“Is that a problem?” Rio asked, genuine concern in her tone.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky laugh, something tender slipping through the cracks of her resolve. “God, no.”</p><p>Because right now, all she could think about was Rio’s fingers pumping inside of her, pushing harder in, her big eyes fixated on Agatha’s. She tried to regain her focus, sliding her own fingers out and back into Rio with force. But it was too much. Rio was too much, too warm, too close, too addictive.</p><p>Their movements grew desperate, their bodies tightening. Rio’s fingers worked in tandem with hers, their gasps turned into whimpers with every thrust, and Agatha felt Rio’s walls clench, which only helped push her harder towards the edge as well.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>, fuck,” Rio pleaded, but she didn’t stop, her hand on Agatha’s lower back pushing her harder onto her fingers.</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio by her chin with her free hand, forcing her to hold her gaze as they grinded against each other, the sounds of their ragged breathing growing louder as they both chased the edge together. Rio tried to tilt her head backwards when Agatha pressed harder against her clit, but Agatha tightened her grip on her chin, forcing her to meet her gaze. In synchronicity, they rolled harder against the other until they were finally coming on each other’s hands, Agatha’s moan guttural, Rio’s cursing like a whimper, shuddering under the older woman.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved.</p><p>Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s hips, holding her close, their bodies still tangled. Rio kept staring at her, her lips parted as she recovered, and Agatha had to bite back a smile, slowly removing her already stiff hand from inside Rio’s underwear. Agatha watched her intently, and she thought she saw something gentle and tender flickering behind the woman’s eyes. Something that terrified her.</p><p>Something she was afraid she might be reflecting back.</p><p>Before either of them could speak, Agatha pulled away, climbing off her lap swiftly, settling back on the passenger seat like nothing had happened.</p><p>She cleared her throat, smoothing her hair, grabbing her blouse from the floor and putting it back on, making sure it covered the marks on her neck.</p><p>“Well,” she said, her voice breathless but laced with forced nonchalance. “We better hurry to this dinner before it gets too late, don’t you think?”</p><hr/><p>As soon as they walked into Alice and Jennifer’s place, Agatha wanted to run away. The house was packed, the sound of nonsensical chattering and clinking glasses filling the air. A few coloured lights flickered in the hallway, and a modest black pine tree stood in a corner, decorated with guitar picks and strange runes. The amount of people made her chest tighten, anxiety bubbling up, but then Rio was taking her hand and guiding her through the crowd, introducing her to anyone she knew.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, letting her body relax next to Rio’s.</p><p>At some point, though, Agatha had drifted away from Rio, losing her in the crowd. Agatha decided it was a good chance to wander around the house, investigating the bathroom, a guest room, and a big wooden door that led to a kind of basement —which was locked, because otherwise she would’ve been prying into the room already.</p><p>She was staring at pictures of Alice and Jennifer when she heard a familiar voice.</p><p>Agatha followed the sound, intending to ask Rio about the absurd number of toothbrushes she’d found in the bathroom. Seriously, why did two people need that many? It was suspicious at best.</p><p>But she was stopped abruptly on her feet when she heard Alice’s voice saying something that sounded weirdly similar to her name.</p><p>She hesitated before stepping closer, staying just outside the room, where the light from inside cast long shadows across the wooden floor.</p><p>“But? What happened between the two of you?” she heard Jennifer ask.</p><p>Rio audibly sighed, and Agatha braced herself for whatever she was about to hear. “Nothing,” Rio said. Agatha felt her stomach twist. “We just fucked, that’s it.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw so hard it hurt, and she had to physically restrain herself from bursting into the room and kicking Rio’s ass, her arms tightly crossed around herself. They’d <em> just </em> fucked? As if Rio hadn’t been on her knees, begging for Agatha to let her touch her. As if she hadn’t been desperately whimpering against the wall just the night before, squirming just a few hours ago in the car under Agatha’s hands. As if it hadn’t meant anything to her, no more than <em> just </em> sex.</p><p>She took a deep breath in. Wasn’t this exactly what she’d wanted? For it all to mean nothing? Agatha shook her head, willing herself to focus.</p><p>“Oh come on, Rio,” Alice pushed. “You have to give us more than that, and you know it.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her heart beating so hard against her chest she wanted nothing more than to rip it out and throw it in Rio’s stupid face.</p><p>“I just—” Rio hesitated. “I just think I need her to go back to New York soon, because—”</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t listen anymore. Yes, she was a sadist, but she wasn’t a <em> masochist </em>. Not yet, at least. She couldn’t stand there and listen to Rio list all the reasons she wanted her gone. She thought higher of herself than that.</p><p>She walked away and towards the empty kitchen, her vision blurry. She wasn’t hurt. No, she was fucking pissed. And she couldn’t even figure out why.</p><p>Agatha braced her hands on the counter, taking slow breaths before reaching out to the pile of used dishes waiting over the sink. If anything else failed, she could always count on some mechanic chore to help her clear her head.</p><p><em> It’ll be over soon </em>, she reminded herself. Rio didn’t know it —Agatha had deliberately avoided mentioning it to her— but she would be out of her hair soon. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, to be more specific. So she only needed to get through tonight before both of them could forget this mess had ever happened in the first place. The thought calmed her down. It would all be over soon. She would forget all about Los Angeles, about Rio Vidal, and none of this would matter.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Still, something heavy sat in her chest. Like a rock not even doing the dishes could move.</p><p>As she rinsed the dirty plates, she heard footsteps behind her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn. She didn’t need to. She already knew it was Rio, her presence so familiar already she could almost smell her perfume from across the room.</p><p>Without acknowledging her, Agatha kept her hands working under the water. But the rest of her body froze, her back rigidly turned to the other woman, Rio’s footsteps stopping close behind her.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, her voice light and easy. Like nothing was wrong.</p><p>It only pushed her irritation further. There she was, anger bubbling inside of her, her brain incapable of pushing that impossible woman away from her thoughts, feeling like a goddamned idiot. And Rio was able to waltz right in as if everything was fine.</p><p>No. If this was their last night together, Agatha would damn well make sure she got everything off her chest.</p><p>Without turning to face her, she inhaled sharply. “I heard you, you know.”</p><p>A pause. She could almost see Rio’s head tilt to the side in confusion. “What?”</p><p>“I heard you talking to Alice and Janice.”</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio corrected.</p><p>Agatha turned around, facing Rio, her arms crossed. The woman was leaning against a wooden table, her fingers gripping its edge.</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha said, wiping her hands on her jeans. “I heard you, and you don’t have to worry about me anymore. I’m leaving tomorrow. Flight’s booked. First thing in the morning,  I’ll finally be out of your way.”</p><p>The words tumbled out of her before she could think them through, and Agatha had to pretend she couldn’t hear the shakiness in her voice. She knew she was being childish, petty even, but she didn’t care. She was beyond caring, and all she wanted to do was make sure Rio knew exactly that.</p><p>Still, the rock in her chest seemed to grow heavier when she saw the pained look on Rio’s face.</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“Because you <em> literally </em>said you needed me to leave,” she snapped, raising her brows like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “It sounded pretty fucking clear to me.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio shut her eyes for a second, inhaling, visibly stressed. “I bet you didn’t catch the rest of that sentence, did you?” she said, stepping closer.</p><p>Agatha took a step back.</p><p>“I said I needed you to leave soon because I—” Rio continued.</p><p>“Because what?” Agatha practically snarled. “What’s so terrible about me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed. “Fuck, Agatha.” Her voice was sharp, her patience gone. Agatha thought she had never seen her look angrier and sexier. “Because I like you.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair, exhaling shakily. “And it scares the shit out of me just how much I like you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, not fully grasping the meaning of the words she was hearing. “What?”</p><p>“Please don’t make me say it again,” Rio muttered, blushing.</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t fight the smirk growing on her face. Her chest felt suddenly lighter.</p><p>She took a step towards Rio. “You like me?” she said, teasing.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, annoyed. “Now’s not the time to be an asshole.”</p><p>The smile on Agatha’s face was only growing wider, her eyes crinkling, her cheeks flushed. <em> God, she’s cute when she’s flustered </em>.</p><p>“I like you too, you idiot.”</p><p>“You’re drunk, Agatha,” Rio scoffed, shaking her head and looking away.</p><p>“I’m not,” she replied, taking another step towards her.</p><p>Rio tried to move away, but she was already trapped, her body caged between Agatha’s and the table behind her. The air in the room felt charged, electric, the distant sounds of the party fading in the background.</p><p>Agatha let the moment stretch, waiting until Rio met her gaze, dark eyes meeting blue. She wanted her eyes on her when she said it.</p><p>“I like you, Rio,” she murmured, exhaling. “And it terrifies me.”</p><p>There. She’d done it.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind, she was half-expecting an applause. A dramatic soundtrack, maybe. When <em> that </em>didn’t happen, she leaned back.</p><p>“I wasn’t lying, though. I really am leaving tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio looked down, and Agatha felt that already familiar warmth coursing through her body.</p><p>Agatha reached her hand out, her fingers holding Rio’s chin up, making her meet her gaze. “I want you to come with me.”</p><p>“What?” Rio said, her brows pulled together.</p><p>“Come spend New Year’s in New York with me.”</p><p>Agatha watched as the words settled in, her pulse pounding. She felt nervous, like a highschool girl expectantly waiting for her crush to circle on the <em> yes </em> on a crumpled piece of notebook paper after asking her to prom. Which was pretty accurate, to be fair.</p><p>After what felt like centuries, Rio smiled.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her like she was drowning and Rio was the only thing keeping her afloat.</p>
