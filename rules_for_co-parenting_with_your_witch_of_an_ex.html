<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! Slightly extensive author's notes below.</p><p>TW for this chapter for discussion of abortion and mild ableism (technically canonical/based on animosity between two characters in canon). I have put an elaboration (with spoilers) on this trigger warning in the end notes on this chapter. Scroll to end of the page to read.</p><p>This fic would not be possible without the help of my beloved friends shannen, why_didnt_i_get_any_soup, and smallblueandloud for beta reading this fic and letting me bounce ideas off of them. I also appreciate weirdhotandtalking on tumblr for reading this with 0 context and telling me that it did make sense. An additional extra special thank you to smallblueandloud and her mom for translating the Spanish in this fic for me.</p><p>Pretty much from the time the show ended I've been wanting to write a fic of Rio and Agatha attempting to co-parent together. I tossed around a few ideas before coming to this one. I will absolutely give credit to the amazing fic "heart's desire" by curiositysdarling for the inspiration for a more "modern" setting while maintaining that Agatha and Rio are witches (you should absolutely read that fic by the way, the pining is so good).</p><p>Just to establish to avoid confusion: Agatha and Rio (plus the rest of the female members of the coven) are witches, but Agatha is not The Witchkiller and Rio is not Death. They both keep their powers as as purple (spirit) and green (life and death) witches. Lady Death is here and she is a separate character. She and Rio are two different people.</p><p>And finally, I love Agatha All Along and I love fandom and I love parts of the Agatha All Along fandom, but I've been seeing some people be pretty awful to others so I want to make this clear: If you are someone who maintains that the AAA fandom is only for cis people, or people who conform to their gender, or exclusively for lesbians, this is not the fic for you, as this fic is written by a bisexual woman who loves trans and gender non conforming folks. &lt;3</p></blockquote>

<em>Alice: Hey did you block Agatha? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: No</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: ...ok because she's asking if you did </em>
</p><p>Rio blinked. Once. She stared blankly at the pile of paperwork in front of her that she had been doing her best to complete when the text from Alice had come in. She looked back at the little blue bubbles of Alice's messages. </p><p>Alice was a good friend—a great friend, even. Rio might count her among her best friends, if she was the sort of person to catalogue her friendships like that. One of the things that made Alice was great was how well she had been keeping her individual friendships with Rio and Agatha separate. In the year since the break-up, Alice had never texted Rio about Agatha even once. </p><p>Rio looked back down at the paperwork and made the executive decision that it could wait. </p><p>
<em>Rio: I mean, I muted her. I didn't block her entirely. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Rio...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Weren't you the one who told me it was ok to block her???? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I'm very proud of you. Good job. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: But apparently she's asking????</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: ...Jen is saying that I need to tell you to unblock her. Or unmute her. Whatever.  </em>
</p><p>Rio's exhale whistled through her teeth. Jen...Jen was Agatha's best friend, even though they would mutually die before admitting it. Jen had once called Rio a "creepy lurker" when she and Agatha had first started dating, a label that Rio wore with pride. She hadn't liked Rio for the entire duration of the relationship and, if gossip was anything to go by, was happy that Agatha and Rio had broken up. </p><p> If <em>Jen</em> was saying that Rio needed to unblock Agatha, it had to be something serious.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Well if Jen says so. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Please tell me when you unmute so I can tell Jen so she stops annoying me about it</em>
</p><p>Rio pulled up her contact for Agatha and hit the unmute button.</p><p>Immediately, her phone began to vibrate with a deluge of missed messages.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You asshole</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You fucking asshole </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You did this on purpose didn't you????</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: I swear to the Mother, Vidal, when I next see you</em>
</p><p>
<em>[One missed call from Agatha Harkness]</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Pick up the phone you bitch! </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Did you fucking block me????</em>
</p><p>Rio jabbed her thumbs aggressively at the keyboard.</p><p>
<em>Rio: You were muted. </em>
</p><p>The three dots that showed that Agatha was typing popped up. Then they went away. Then they came back.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Rio, I need you to be honest. Did you do this on purpose? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Do what? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Rio, I'm serious. Did you???</em>
</p><p>Rio stared at the phone, feeling the furrow in her brow deepening even further.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Agatha. I do not know what you are talking about. </em>
</p><p>The three dots showed up and then went away again. Rio had begun to type a series of question marks when an image came through.</p><p>It was a picture of Agatha's (gorgeous, amazing, wonderful) hands. One of those hands was flipping Rio off. The other hand was holding a positive pregnancy test. </p><p>Rio felt her stomach lurch. Oh shit. <em>Oh shit. </em></p><p> </p><p>You see, when a mommy witch and a mommy witch love each other very much, they can....</p><p>Scratch that.</p><p>When a mommy witch and a mommy witch love each other very much, but their own separate trauma conga lines make it pretty impossible to be good romantic partners to each other (Agatha refused to communicate and would shut down while Rio tried overly hard to communicate. To a fault), they break off their relationship in a god awful fight their former neighbors are still talking about. They promise their mutual friend group that it's all good, that they can behave themselves, but proceed to be such absolute terrors to one another in public that it's mutually decided amongst their friends that they will be invited to separate events until they can behave. And so it goes, until they are both, separately, invited to Lilia's Summer Solstice party and, under the influence of not seeing each other for a year (and more than one substance), fuck in the bathroom about it.</p><p>And, as can happen, when a mommy witch and a mommy witch come together in the midst of a fertility festival and declare their love for one another, the Divine Mother will bless their union with a child.</p><p>Or so Rio was told, growing up. Now, as she chewed on her bottom lip, she contemplated her hazy memories of what had happened in the bathroom. She vaguely remembered talking to Hela and spying on Agatha flirting with Wanda across the room, which had made Rio's stomach curdle. She remembered Lilia giving her a tea which she drank of deeply, which made everything seem hazy and vague. She remembered Alice handing her a flower crown to put on her head, then tugging her outside to see the bonfire. She remembered the feeling of her green magic unwinding joyfully around her before cozying up against Agatha's spirit magic. If she thinks particularly hard, she can vaguely remember the sensation of pushing Agatha up onto the sink before sliding two fingers inside her. </p><p>But she can't remember what was said, what intentions were set, just the feeling of the push and pull between her and Agatha that had felt so strong and so familiar.  She did remember Agatha's mouth, once it was all over, twisting harshly and spitting out "I told you I didn't want to see your face. This was a mistake" before she hopped off the sink and left Rio, bereft, with her underwear damply clinging to her and her hand sticky. </p><p>When she'd woken up the next morning and remembered these pieces of memory, shoddily strung together like the world's worst friendship bracelet, she'd finally muted Agatha in her phone, if only to keep the latent hope from flinging itself around her chest. </p><p>
<em>Maybe she'll text me. Maybe we'll find our way back to each other. Maybe maybe maybe maybe. </em>
</p><p>They had found their way back to each other, Rio supposed. Just not the way she ever expected it to happen.</p><p>She was still staring at the picture of the pregnancy test, her heart racing, when the phone began to ring. Part of her assumed (hoped) that it would be Agatha's name on the screen, but instead, it was Alice's. </p><p>"I unmuted her," Rio said, in lieu of a greeting, when she picked up.</p><p>"Ok, ok," Alice said. "Did she say why she wanted to contact you?"</p><p>"Uh, yeah."</p><p>"Cool." </p><p>Rio heard a rustle, as though Alice was moving the phone away from her ear, then a bellow. </p><p>"Jen! Will you tell me what the fuck is happening now?"</p><p>"What the fuck, Alice?" Rio asked, moving her phone away from her own ear, which was smarting from the high decibels. </p><p>"Jen wouldn't tell me what's up with Agatha until she told you."</p><p>"Maybe you should let Agatha tell you herself," Rio muttered.</p><p>"No way. You're all being weird and cagey about it, so I need to know now." Her volume, somehow, increased from the previous yell. "Jen! Tell me!"</p><p>"Wouldn't Jen telling you be like a HIPPA violation or something?" Rio asked.</p><p>Alice gasped. "Oh my Gods. Agatha's pregnant?"</p><p><em>Oh fuck. </em>Rio groaned. "I didn't say that, I—"</p><p>Alice hung up and the line went dead. Rio groaned again and rubbed her fingers together, in hopes the movement would provide its usual soothing abilities. </p><p><em>Shit.</em> She hadn't responded to Agatha's picture and now she'd taken long enough that the delay was probably weird. She resisted the urge to google <em>what to ask your ex when she tells you she's pregnant</em>.</p><p>Finally, she settled on texting Agatha a <em>How are you feeling?</em></p><p>Her phone buzzed in response almost immediately.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Horrible. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Morning sickness isn't only in the morning. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: I had to call out of work twice this week. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Oh shit. I'm so sorry. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: What can I do? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Have you considered going back in time and never meeting me? </em>
</p><p>That hit Rio like an arrow through the chest. <em>Fuck.</em> Rio bit at her lip until it hurt and texted back.</p><p>
<em>Rio: I mean, you can talk to Lilia about that if you want to make it a reality. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Yeah, that's not how her magic works. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Well green doesn't have anything to do with time. So. </em>
</p><p>Rio stroked her fingers against the rubbery edges of her phone case (still not nearly as soothing as it usually was), then hesitantly sent Agatha another text.</p><p>
<em>Rio: What's the plan as of now? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Sleep and try not to throw up</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: No I mean, like. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: ...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Spit it out. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Are you keeping it?</em>
</p><p>There was a long pause. Not even any typing dots. Rio resisted the urge to call Agatha and beg for...something. She wasn't sure what. </p><p>
<em>Agatha: Oh fuck you Rio. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: ????</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: I don't know what I did</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Fuck you </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Agatha I just want to know if I need to start preparing to co-parent or if I need to have a conversation with Jen. </em>
</p><p>There was the three dots for what felt like forever, and then no response. Rio let her phone drop down onto the stack of paperwork and buried her face in her hands, breathing as deeply and steadily as she could. It took her several long moments for her to steady her breathing. When she thought that it was as good as it would get, she picked up her phone again and texted Jen.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Hello Jen. I don't know what has been discussed between you and Agatha, but let me know if my magic is needed. </em>
</p><p>There. Professional. Rio silenced her phone so she couldn't hear it anymore and crossed the short distance from her desk to her bed. She flopped down, burying her face in the pillow. She heard her tarantula familiar, Victoria, give a hiss of concern from her tank in the corner but Rio couldn't bring herself to raise her head to reassure her spider. </p><p>The summer and winter solstices were, arguably, the most important days of the year for witches (depending on the practices, traditions, and culture of the witch in question). The spring equinox and Halloween kept a green witch like Rio busy (cycle of life and death and all of that), but it was the solstices where the veil grew thin and everyone's magic went more than a little wonky. </p><p>A child conceived during a solstice was usually powerful from the start of their existence. Traditional abortion methods, if that was Agatha's choice, would fail and a very special working would need to be done by a powerful green witch in order to end it. A healer, even one as good as Jen, would not be able to cut it. </p><p>Rio wasn't a midwife, she was a death doula, but she'd been hired to perform the working twice before. But that of course had been with clients, strangers. She had no idea how she would approach this with Agatha. With Agatha being pregnant with her kid.</p><p>She ended up falling into a fitful, anxiety filled, nap and only checked her phone when she resurfaced. There were no texts from Agatha, but Jen had responded.</p><p>
<em>Jen: I'll let you know if it's needed but I highly doubt it. </em>
</p><p>Rio merely had the energy to send a thumbs up emoji before she fell back into bed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't hear from Jen or Agatha for the rest of the week, though Alice texted her most days with a false casualness and Lilia, as she was wont to do, sent her a blurry picture of a tarot spread that Rio didn't take the time to parse through. Despite her usual boundaries with her work and life balance, she threw herself into her job. It would be rude to obsessively check her phone when she was with her patients and their families. They deserved to have her entire focus.</p><p>She was leaving the hospital from a new patient intake when she finally received a text from Agatha.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: I need you to go to lunch with me on Saturday. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: This is not a date. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha:<u> Link to calendar invite. </u></em>
</p><p>Rio felt her eyebrows rise nearly to her hairline but sent back a quick <em>I can be there</em>. </p><p>She got a phone call from Alice about an hour after she made it home.</p><p>"Jen told me that Agatha told her that she was inviting you to lunch," Alice said, after their customary greetings.</p><p>"Yes," Rio confirmed. "And?"</p><p>"Is it in a public place?"</p><p>"Yes," Rio repeated. "It's at a public cafe. I have been there before, even."</p><p>"Ok, that's good," Alice said. "You two are much more likely to behave in public."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Based on previous experience, I foresee this meeting ending in either a screaming match or the two of you hooking up in the bathroom," Alice said.</p><p>"The bathroom there really isn't clean enough for that," Rio said.</p><p>"So, you thought about it then?"</p><p>"What! No! It's a public bathroom, Alice! It's barely sanitary to go to the <em>bathroom</em> in there."</p><p>"Well I'm glad that you won't have sex with Agatha in the bathroom, then."</p><p>"Alice, she's angry with me. That's...that won't be happening."</p><p>Alice's voice somehow became more skeptical. "You once got super drunk and told me how much you missed angry sex with Agatha."</p><p>"That's-What? That's different."</p><p>"How?" Alice asked.</p><p>"That was within the parameters of our relationship," Rio explained. "And therefore, was acceptable within the bounds of that relationship. We're not in a relationship anymore."</p><p>"And this baby happened how, then?"</p><p>"I don't-I'm-" Rio stuttered. "I don't know-"</p><p>"You made a kid and you don't remember how it happened?" Alice asked, incredulously.</p><p>Rio rubbed at her forehead. "Lila's drinks were really strong, ok? I don't remember much after you and I went outside to the bonfire."</p><p>"Huh," Alice said. "I didn't think the drinks were that strong."</p><p>"Well, guess I'm a lightweight," Rio said, peevishly. </p><p>"Sure," Alice said, her voice still skeptical. "Please don't fuck Agatha in the bathroom."</p><p>"I won't do it again," Rio promised.</p><p>"Again?" Alice shrieked, her voice shrill enough that Rio's ear was still aching for thirty minutes after she got off the phone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arrived at the cafe fifteen minutes early. Maybe it was her being overeager, but she was able to order a pastry and a drink and grab a table. She debated ordering for Agatha, since Rio still remembered all of her favorites, but then discarded the idea. Agatha might get pissed off at her for that, might see it as Rio overstepping.</p><p>She was playing with her phone and nibbling half-heartedly at her pastry when Agatha's shadow fell over the table. Rio looked up as Agatha slid into the seat across from her, her face stony.</p><p>"Hi," Rio said, politely. "How're you?"</p><p>"Did you know, that in order to form it's own bones, the fetus steals calcium from the mother's?" Agatha asked.</p><p>"Uh, I think I did actually." Rio vaguely remembered Jen mentioning that, maybe, at some point. </p><p>"Cool. And you did this to me anyway?"</p><p>"I don't...you keep accusing me of doing something and I'm not sure what exactly?" Rio said, the pitch of the sentence rising with her confusion. </p><p>"You're telling me that you, a green witch, with domain over life and death, are seriously claiming ignorance in how I got pregnant?" Agatha demanded. Her voice rose loudly enough that a few people at nearby tables started looking over.</p><p>"Keep you voice down!" Rio hissed, not wanting to draw unwanted attention or to interrupt the people around them. </p><p>"Seriously? You're policing my tone now?"</p><p>"Agatha no! I don't know! I-" Rio floundered. "I remember only half of the party. I vaguely remember being in the bathroom with you and what happened there. I don't. I don't remember. I wish I did—"</p><p>"Seriously?" Agatha repeated, but her voice was a little softer. </p><p>"I don't know what was in my head at the time that it happened. Maybe I did think something errant, something that lead to...I don't know. But I'm sorry." Rio swallowed hard. "I'm sorry I stuck you with this. I texted Jen already. I'll do the working for you. I'm strong enough. It'll work. If that's what you want."</p><p>Agatha's face grew dark. "If that's what I want?" she repeated.</p><p>Rio nodded. "I've done it before, for a few patients. I can do it for you." She suddenly became aware that her hands were shaking against the sides of her cup and she gripped it tighter in hopes of ending the movement. "I'm not going to make you do something...keep something that you don't want."</p><p>Agatha's anger seemed to deflate. "You are such an idiot," she muttered.</p><p>Rio looked at her, at her perfect face, at her long fingers that drummed against the table, at her windswept hair and thought to herself, <em>Yes. I'm an idiot. I let you slip through my fingers. </em></p><p>"What am I being idiotic about this time?"</p><p>Agatha glared at her. "I'm keeping the baby. Obviously."</p><p>All of the air in Rio's lungs punched out of her. A baby. Agatha had called it-them a baby. Agatha was keeping the baby.</p><p>
<em>Agatha was keeping Rio's baby. </em>
</p><p>"Oh, wow. Ok," Rio could barely catch her breath. Agatha just stared at her expectantly. "Ok, so. What do you-what do you need from me?"</p><p>Agatha reached into her pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. "I've created a series of rules for us to use to navigate this..." her lips pursed, "situation."</p><p>Rules. Rules were good. Rio <em>loved </em>rules and clear expectations. She took the paper from Agatha's hand, knowing that she was appearing overeager, and unfolded it.</p><p>
<em>Rule 1: Agatha Harkness, the mother of the child, recognizes that Rio Vidal is the father of this child. As such, Rio Vidal has certain rights to the child. Once the child is born, Agatha Harkness expects that Rio Vidal will secure a family lawyer for herself in order to create a reasonable and enforceable custody agreement that is in the best interests of the child.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rule 2: The care of Agatha Harkness and the unborn child will be overseen by Jennifer Kale. Agatha Harkness will make medical decisions based on the recommendations of Jennifer Kale and her team. Rio Vidal is permitted to voice opinions and suggestions for care, but Agatha Harkness will make all final determinations for care of herself and the unborn child. Once the child is born, medical decisions will be made based on the created parenting plan. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rule 3: Agatha Harkness expects Rio VIdal to make appropriate preparations for the child, such as and including reading parenting books, taking parenting classes, and purchasing materials for the child.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rule 4: Communication between Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness should focus on the child and should not include unrelated topics. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rule 5: Rio Vidal is not to make physical contact with Agatha Harkness unless given explicit permission. </em>
</p><p>Rio finished the list and took a deep breath. This was good. She had guidelines now. Parameters. She could work with this. She would be the absolute best co-parent possible for Agatha for the next 8ish months.</p><p>"Is this my copy?" she asked, her voice surprisingly steady. "Or should I take a picture of it?"</p><p>Agatha's eyebrow raised slightly in surprise. "No, that's your copy," she said.</p><p>"Excellent," Rio said. She skimmed through the rules again. "I think these are all reasonable requests. Do you need any financial assistance from me to proceed with medical care?"</p><p>Agatha seemed to relax. "No, not at this time. It's all new enough my insurance is still determining coverage."</p><p>"We can split all of the costs 50-50 until the birth of the child," Rio said. "Maybe that should be included as Rule 6." She pulled a pen out of her pocket to write on the paper. "Otherwise, financial support can be determined once the child is here and the custody arrangement is figured out. I know that custody won't be split 50-50 until the baby is older."</p><p>Her script was messier than Agatha's, but she managed to cram in <em>Rule 6: All costs related to the child will be split 50-50 until the child is born or a custody agreement including child support is created.</em> Rio slid the paper and pen over to Agatha's side of the table. "Do you have your own copy? So you can make sure you have the same wording." </p><p>"I'll take a picture," Agatha said. </p><p>"Ok, well, I think that's all I have to add," Rio said. "But I can contact you if I think of anything else."</p><p>"Yes, you can," Agatha said. She snapped a picture of the rules paper with her phone and then handed it back to Rio. </p><p>"Great." Rio folded the paper and stuck it into her pocket. "Is there anything else you need from me?"</p><p>"That will be all."</p><p>"Then I'll be on my way. Please let me know if you need anything. Anything at all." Rio slid her chair back, cringing as it scraped loudly across the floor. "I would appreciate if you keep me updated on how you and the baby are doing. I'll...well. I'll worry otherwise."</p><p>Agatha seemed caught off guard. "I will." She swallowed. "Rio, you swear you didn't do this on purpose?"</p><p>Rio licked her lips. "You think so little of me," she asked, lowly, "that you think I would get you pregnant, without your consent, on purpose?"</p><p>Agatha seemed to deflate a little. "I don't know. No. Maybe. It's all so unexpected."</p><p>"Well, I didn't," Rio spit out. <em>This </em>was why she'd let Agatha slip through her fingers. The accusations that Agatha would throw at her, not caring how much it would hurt. She stood up and nodded sharply at Agatha. "Te veo" she said, before walking out of the coffee shop.</p><p> </p><p>A day of work and a few texts exchanged with Alice later (<em>It was fine. We didn't fight. I swear I'm not lying. Agatha gave me some rules she wants me to follow while she's pregnant. We'll be able to be civil</em>), Rio stumbled home to her lonely shoebox of an apartment. The walls were a stark gray and the lightbulbs made her eyes twitch, but she'd filled every available space with as many plants as she could possibly cram in. She searched the pots to find Victoria, who she had let out to explore before she left for the day. She found Victoria in the tarantula's second favorite plant to hang out in and Victoria waved her little legs to Rio as she approached. </p><p>"Ay, tremendo día, Victoria." She picked up the tarantula and let her make her way up Rio's arm and across her shoulders. "I'm gonna be a dad. ¿No te lo dije? Agatha's gonna have our baby."</p><p>Victoria seemed to start at this. Her little legs drummed out a frantic pattern against Rio's shoulder.</p><p>"...Solo un nene. No somos arañas, acuérdate. There won't be many. Pues -- at least, I think it's one. Jen will be able to check."</p><p>This didn't seem to comfort Victoria at all and she made her way up Rio's head.</p><p>"Coño, I'll need to get a new apartment. There's not enough room here for a baby. We'll need to find a place with enough room for all of us. Tú, yo, el nene, las plantas..."</p><p>She let her voice trail off and hang in the space around them. Victoria burrowed deeper into Rio's hair, nesting. In the peace and quiet, Rio closed her eyes and let herself drift. </p><p>At first, she found herself trying to picture what the baby would look like. Rio was an only child, but her parents had both had giant families. It had felt like every time she'd attended a family function, there would be a new baby.  That experience helped her picture a bundle, with a little hat and a blanket, but found a hard time picturing a baby's face. Would their eyes be brown or blue? Would their hair be her darker shade, almost black, or Agatha's brunette? Would they smile like her or Agatha? Would they inherit one of their forms of magic or develop one all their own? Blood witches tended to take after their mother, so it would stand to reason that this child would be a spirit witch, a siphon, like Agatha. The thought made Rio smile and she found herself picturing it more easily. A small child of indeterminate gender, scrawny, with long hair, following Agatha around, little purple sparks drifting off their fingers.</p><p>Purple sparks...Rio closed her eyes, her face pinching. She remembered the purple sparks. She remembered...</p><p>
<em>Lilia's bonfire crackled in front of her, the flames leaping high. They shifted a rainbow of colors, leaping from red to purple to blue. In Rio's floaty, out-of-it state, she couldn't tell if it was magic or just her imagination. </em>
</p><p>
<em>She crashed into someone's shoulder. Alice. It was Alice's shoulder. Alice's warm orange magic swirled around her, tickling. It felt like a giggle would sound, the feeling helped along by Alice's laughter. Their hands tangled together and Rio pressed a sloppy platonic kiss to Alice's cheek, which made Alice laugh harder. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I've missed you," she whisper-shouted in Alice's ear. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I missed you!" Alice exclaimed. For once, Rio didn't flinch at the volume of her voice. "We need to hang out!" </em>
</p><p>
<em>"We doooooo," Rio drawled. "Just you and me." </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes! Yes! Yes!" Alice agreed, nodding fervently. Her face was flushed from alcohol and the heat of the bonfire. Rio's green magic spiraled around them with a crackling playfulness, until it was shoved along by Alice's protection magic. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"I'm going to get us another drink," Alice declared, turning back to go back inside. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ok!" Rio said. "If Lilia has marshmallows, bring those too! We can make s'mores!" </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice gave her a thumbs up as she went inside. Rio felt jittery, her magic still swirling around. Normally, it felt like this at the equinoxes or Halloween, not during a solstice. It began to jump around, swirling from person to person. Lilia's other friends who she had invited, that redhead Agatha had been flirting with, the sweet Hispanic kid that Rio had talked to for a little bit in Spanish, Lilia herself, Jen who was wrapped around Lilia, and...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha. </em>
</p><p><br/>
<em>Rio's magic slammed into Agatha's magic hard enough that Rio felt the jolt resonate through her body. She fell forward, grasping at nothing, and felt her hands and knees scrapping along the ground. Her magic though, was spiraling into an excited dance with Agatha's purple. It went round and round and round and Rio, dizzily, felt like she was going around with it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Someone came and picked her up. She clutched at the strangers arms, lurching, her body unsure of which way was up. She felt, somehow, even more lightheaded than before. Her whole body felt warm and tingly. She groaned a little. Her magic was twining around Agatha's, tightly coiling themselves together.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Rio," came Agatha's voice. She also sounded intoxicated. Exacerbated too. She frowned down at Rio, who knew her facial expression must be idiotic. "You hurt yourself. Come on, let's get you cleaned up." </em>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi! I'm so glad people liked the first chapter!</p><p>TWs for this chapter: discussions of hospice care/the death process, minor character death (one adult and one teenager, both OCs), racism against a hispanic person, mildly dubious consent for sex between two characters under the influence of substances and magic. Elaboration with spoilers in the end notes. If you want more details without the spoilers message me on tumblr at <a href="https://paperairplanesopenwindows.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">paperairplanesopenwindows.</a>. I'd hate for anyone to accidentally trigger themselves with this fic &lt;3.</p><p>A big inspiration for the way Rio talks to her patient in this chapter was a clip from the show "Dying for Sex" that I saw out of context on Tik Tok. I really liked the way that the hospice nurse in the clip explained the dying process to the main character of the show and her family. Also I should mention that the way that magic works around the solstices in this series is inspired by a Klaine series I read in my Glee days where the Glee kids were mages and I cannot find it again but I will try harder to dig it up before the next chapter so I can credit that properly.</p><p>Thank you to smallblueandloud for both the Spanish help and the beta. She's also, once again, the MVP for this chapter because she really helped me with developing Rio's cultural background for this fic and gave me tips based on her own lived experience. Additional thank you to Shannen for the autism help and the copy edits.</p><p>This chapter was posted as a reward to myself because we had a weather hold at school today and I was trapped in a room with 28 7th graders for an hour longer than I was supposed to be. At least my AC didn't go out like it did yesterday.</p><p>Reminder once again, that Rio isn't Death in this fic and Death is an entity separate from Rio!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Lilia had a friend who knew someone who had a friend and so, Rio was able to obtain a family lawyer.</p><p>The consultation was free. The man behind the desk, while not a witch himself, had enough knowledge of the community to not completely balk at Rio's blunt "I fathered a baby with my ex-girlfriend." He kindly laid out that there wasn't much that could be done until the baby was born, but he would represent Rio in court, if needed. Hopefully, though, she and Agatha would be able to mediate and avoid a drawn out legal battle.</p><p>He laughed a little when Rio shared the rules with him. "Well, at least she's willing to work with you," he said. "While animosity helps line my pockets, you're better off with someone who is going to come to the table with you in the kid's best interest." </p><p>Rio had agreed with him and signed the paperwork necessary to hire him on. When she left the office, she thought about telling Agatha, but didn't know if that would break Rule 4. Instead, she texted her group chat with Alice and Lilia. </p><p>
<em>Rio: Lawyer acquired. Thanks for the rec, Lilia. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: ALREADY? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Yeah. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Seems kinda soon. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Figured it was good to get a start on that now</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lilia: You're welcome! </em>
</p><p>Rio wasn't sure who told Agatha (she would bet on Alice, though), but wouldn't say that she was surprised when she got a text from Agatha the next day. </p><p>
<em>Agatha: You got a lawyer? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Yes.</em>
</p><p>There were the three dots for a moment, then.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: That was fast. </em>
</p><p>Rio almost texted back "Lilia knew somebody" but figured that would break Rule 4.</p><p>In lieu of that, she texted back <em>Do you need his contact information for your lawyer?</em></p><p>The three dots, once again, started then stopped.</p><p>
<em>Agatha: I don't have one yet, but send me the contact information for when I do. </em>
</p><p>Rio sent a thumbs up emoji and a link to the lawyer's website and thought nothing else of it.</p><p>Rio was hanging out with Alice a week later, when Alice told her "Agatha was bitching about you getting a lawyer."</p><p>"Why?" Rio asked, then quickly followed up with. "No, wait, don't tell me. We've been good about you, you know, not sharing information about Agatha. You shouldn't break that now." </p><p>Alice looked at her quizzically. "She's having your baby."</p><p>"Yeah, well. She didn't plan to. She set a bunch of boundaries and I want to respect them." Rio licked her lips. "It's the least I can do."</p><p>Alice frowned at that and Rio gave a little shrug. "You know," she elaborated, "she's going to be growing a human being for a total of nine months, then go through the whole birthing process, which I hear is awful. And then after all of that, she has to hand the kid off to me, her ex she detests, half the time. It's a lot. I feel like she got the short end of the stick. So, yeah. Don't give me updates on her, I don't think she'd like that you're doing that." </p><p>Alice nodded in sympathy. "Sure, I can stop it." She stabbed her straw aggressively into her drink.  "I just had to put up with Jen complaining about Agatha being a bitch more than usual all week."</p><p>Rio nodded sympathetically. "I know Agatha can be a lot but. She is pregnant."</p><p>"Yeah," Alice sighed. "We have what? Eight more months."</p><p>Rio's stomach fluttered. "Uh, seven ish. I think." She counted in her head. "She's close to nine weeks now, I believe. I don't know the date of her last period and that's when they start counting." </p><p>Alice muttered something under her breath that Rio didn't catch.</p><p>"I will say," Rio added, ignoring her friend's muttering. "I don't know why she's being bitchy. <em>She</em> told me to get a lawyer. It was in the rules that she gave me."</p><p>Alice's brow arched. "Agatha gave you rules?" </p><p>"I told you that," Rio said. </p><p>"You're right, I should've realized that you were being literal," Alice said. "What were they like?" </p><p>"Clear and straight to the point," Rio said. "Thank the Mother. It really helped. Now I know what she needs me to do while we wait for the baby to get here."</p><p>"Do you have a copy of these rules?" Alice asked. "I'm just curious."</p><p>"Sure," Rio said, bemused, and handed her phone over with a picture of the rules displayed. Alice read them, her eyebrows climbing higher and higher on her forehead. She fully took the phone out of Rio's hand and began typing on it.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Rio asked, vaguely alarmed. </p><p>"Just texting myself a copy of these," Alice said. Her voice was slightly high pitched.</p><p>"Why?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Just. You know. As your friend and Agatha's friend. Seemed good to know. Huh. Agatha wrote these?" </p><p>"Yes, she wrote them. What, do you think she ran it through AI or something?" </p><p>"Nope," Alice said, handing Rio her phone back. "That absolutely sounds like Agatha's voice. I can hear her reading them in my head." </p><p>"Cool, well. I'm just doing my best to follow them. I want to show her that I'll be a good co-parent, despite our past issues." </p><p>"Rio," Alice said, sadly. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>Alice's mouth opened, then closed again. "You're going to be a great parent," she finally said. </p><p>"Being a good parent and being a good co-parent are two different things," Rio pointed out. </p><p>"I know," Alice said. "But I think you'll be great at both." </p><p>A week later, Agatha texted Rio. </p><p>
<em>Agatha: I have my 10 week appointment on Wednesday at 4 pm. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Ok. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Thank you for letting me know. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You're busy at that time? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: If so I can reschedule it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: OH. No. I am available at that time. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: <u>Link to calendar invite</u></em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Make sure you are there at least 15 minutes early. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: *thumbs up emoji*</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was weird to be at Jen's office as a....Rio wasn't sure what the right term to use was. Patient? Maybe? She'd heard about it off and on over the years, when she'd listened in on conversations Jen had with others or on the occasional times that Jen had deigned to speak to her. To be sitting in a chair in the lobby that she had only ever heard about was disconcerting. </p><p>Agatha was already there when Rio arrived (despite Rio being promptly fifteen minutes early), looking uncharacteristically nervous. She was staring at her phone, not scrolling, so Rio just breathed out a quiet "Hi" when she sat down. Agatha barely glanced up at her. </p><p>"What is this appointment for?" Rio asked. "The ten week?"</p><p>Agatha doesn't look up from her phone. "I thought I told you to do research to prepare for parenting." </p><p>"Right," Rio said, seeing no point in arguing that Rule 3 was for "appropriate preparations for the child" and had no mention of Rio needing to familiarize herself with the ins and outs of Agatha's medical appointments. She pulled her own phone out and googled <em>what to expect at 10 week pregnancy appointment</em>. Blood tests checking for fetal abnormalities, apparently, but also hear the baby's heartbeat and see them on the sonogram. That cheered Rio up a bit, that she might get to see the baby for the first time. </p><p>The nurse appeared and called for "Agatha." As Agatha rose gracefully from her chair, Rio dutifully gathered her things and followed behind. The nurse was a little too cheerful, keeping up constant chatter as she checked Agatha in and weighed her. When they were in the individual room, she asked Agatha a stream of questions, which Agatha answered more and more tersely as the questioning went on. </p><p>When the nurse left, Rio and Agatha breathed identical sighs of relief. Rio could tell that Agatha was side eyeing her a little bit, so she busied herself with her phone. </p><p>"She didn't ask who you are," Agatha finally said. </p><p>"What?" Rio asked, looking up. </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. "She didn't ask who you were." </p><p>"She asked my name," Rio said, confused. </p><p>"No-she-" Agatha huffed. "She didn't ask if you were," Rio knew that she was looking at Agatha with rapidly increasing confusion, which seemed to only multiply Agatha's frustration. "She didn't ask if you were the baby's other parent or my friend or what!" </p><p>"Oh." Rio hadn't noticed and now that it had been pointed out, that did feel weird. She blinked a few times. "Maybe she thought we were sisters or something." </p><p>"Sisters," Agatha hissed. "If she thought that we were sisters..." </p><p>There was a knock at the door and Jen stepped in. "Agatha, Rio, hey." She smiled pleasantly and didn't show any surprise that Rio was there. Rio supposed that Agatha had probably told her ahead of time that Rio would be coming. "Let's get started on the appointment." </p><p>"Your nurse is homophobic," Agatha barked. </p><p>"What?" Jen said, taken aback. </p><p>"She didn't ask what my relationship to Agatha is, so Agatha has concluded that the nurse must be homophobic," Rio said. The look Agatha gave her was so abrasive it could take paint off the wall. Rio sat further back into her chair, crossing her arms. </p><p>"Ok," Jen said, in her special <em>I can't believe I put up with you, Agatha</em> tone. "I can assure you that every single person who works here has indicated that they are Queer affirming, otherwise they wouldn't work here. I will speak with the nurse, however, to make sure that there wasn't an issue I'm unaware of." </p><p>Agatha's mouth twisted. "Good." </p><p>"Now, I know you had to answer a bunch of questions already, but there is some more information that I need to get from you," Jen said. </p><p>Jen did ask more questions about how Agatha was feeling, sleeping, and eating. Rio listened attentively. Agatha reported that while she felt very tired and had morning sickness, her sleeping and eating was otherwise normal. "I had that weird metal taste for a bit that you said was normal," she said. "But it went away. Though I was chewing gum nonstop."</p><p>"Excellent," Jen said, making a note. "And how are you doing, Rio?" </p><p>Rio flinched. Jen leveled her anticipatory gaze onto Rio. Even Agatha looked over at her. </p><p>"I'm fine," Rio said, automatically. When Jen continued to look at her, clearly expecting more, Rio elaborated a little. "It's all just a shock, is all." She wiped her sweaty hands off on her jeans. "I've been reading about, you know. Pregnancy and what to expect. So that I know what's happening." </p><p>She let herself lapse into silence. Jen was still looking at her, but when Rio didn't continue to speak, Jen reset and turned her focus back to Agatha. </p><p>"Let me go get our ultrasound technician so that we can take a look at the baby." </p><p>"Ok," Rio and Agatha said simultaneously. It was weird to hear their voices together. Rio looked off towards the door and silently ran her fingers over the armrest of her chair until the ultrasound tech and Jen reentered the room. </p><p> </p><p>Not long after, Rio found herself in the car, staring at the sonogram print out she'd been handed in the office. The baby looked like a couple of blobs, with a round circle at the top that would grow to be the head and a sort of oblong shape for the rest of the body. Jen had said that the baby had reached the most critical part of development and would start kicking and stretching the next week, though Agatha wouldn't be able to feel the movement until further down the road. She'd also pointed out the baby's little arms to Rio and Agatha, but Rio could only sort of see them in the sonogram when she squinted. </p><p>Still. Her heart swelled. That's her kid. The weird little chunky blob is her kid. </p><p>She snapped a quick photo of the sonogram and sent it to Lilia and Alice. </p><p>
<em>Alice: That's the baby????</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lilia: Oh Rio. They're precious. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: They're a weird little alien blob but they're my weird little alien blob</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I can't wait to see them when they have a proper little faaaaaaaaaace</em>
</p><p>Rio laugh reacted at Alice's comment and put the phone away so that she could drive home. </p><p>When she got home and checked her phone again, there was a text from Agatha. </p><p>
<em>Agatha: Thank you for coming today. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Will you be able to make the next appointment? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: <u>Link to calendar invite</u></em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: I will need to check my schedule with my patients. I will let you know once I know for sure. </em>
</p><p>She sat in the car, waiting, but there was no response from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>After the doctor's visit, Rio started to make proper preparations for the baby, </p><p>She ordered the top rated parenting books that she found online. She booked herself back into therapy, in hopes she doesn't push any generational bullshit onto her kid. She told her gossipiest cousin about the pregnancy and let it spread throughout the larger extended family (she loved her family, especially after how they'd rallied behind her after her parents' deaths. But by the Gods, the idea of calling every aunt, uncle, and cousin and telling them about the pregnancy filled her with dread).</p><p>Her lease would be up in about six months, which felt like an impossible length and not nearly enough time, so she began searching a little to see if she could find a two bedroom in her budget within the neighborhood. The sonogram print out and the to-do list of shit she'd need to get done over the next seven months went up next to each other on her fridge. </p><p>Parental leave as an on call death doula would, by necessity, not be the most traditional leave (if Rio was able to take one at all), but on the advice of a fellow doula, she updated her website to reflect a pause on intake of new patients for the time being. It'd be good to just focus on her current patients, she reasoned, and she could always make adjustments as needed when they get closer to the due date.</p><p>Raquel was the first of her patients to notice any sort of change. Rio had set the sonogram as her phone lock screen for the day (sue her, looking at it made her happy) and Raquel was a pretty observant teen when she wasn't in horrible pain.</p><p>"Is that a baby?" she asked with a squeal when Rio's phone lit up from a notification. </p><p>"Yep," Rio said. She swiped the notification off the screen so that Raquel can see the picture better. </p><p>"Is it your baby? Oh my god, Rio you're pregnant?" she asked, her eyes growing wider by the second. </p><p>Rio couldn't help but smirk a little. She quickly schooled her face as Raquel's eyes seemed to grow even wider. "Well. It's my baby, but I'm not the one that's pregnant." </p><p>"Huh," Raquel said. Her eyes flicked from the sonogram, to Rio's stomach, and then back. "Is this a witchy thing I never learned?" </p><p>Rio felt her face soften. Raquel was a blood witch and had been in the makings of a protection witch, like Alice, when her illness started. Her diagnosis and frequent hospital visits had kept her from having a formal magic education and, now that she was in hospice, she never would. </p><p>"Two witches can make a baby together, yes," Rio said, hoping to keep the conversation there. </p><p>"Huh," Raquel said. "And it's a girl baby?' </p><p>"What makes you think that?" </p><p>Raquel shrugged. "Cause of the chromosomes? You need a Y chromosome to have a boy and girls have two X's. If I'm remembering my Bio class correctly, anyway." </p><p>"Well, it depends," Rio said. She watched Raquel shift a little uncomfortably on the bed. "Do you want me to adjust your pillows?" </p><p>"Yes, please," Raquel said, gratefully. "But then I want you to give me the witch version of 'The Talk.'" Rio pulled a face at that and Raquel pointed her finger at her. "You told me on our first appointment that you would answer all of my questions!" </p><p>"I meant about the death process." </p><p>"Well, you told me that life is a cycle, so it's not <em>not</em> part of the death process." </p><p>Rio laughed at that and Raquel grinned in that pleased way that teenagers will do when they'd gotten one over an adult. Rio reached around Raquel to adjust the pillows. "Well," she said, once the task was done, "it's not that different from the normal making of a baby. You have to be having sex with someone, but the intention of making a baby needs to be there. Your magic has to...combine, I guess is the best way to say it. Witches have different methods for setting the intention. I've heard of incantations and runes. But some swear that all you have to do is think about it." </p><p>"Ok," Raquel said. "And all the babies are girls? Is that why witches are mostly girls?" </p><p>"Yes and no," Rio said, as she settled back into the armchair next to Raquel's bed. "Babies conceived by two female witches are more likely to be girls, statistically. Like you said, witches are more likely to be girls and a baby conceived from magic is more likely to be magical." </p><p>"There's boy witches though," Raquel said. </p><p>"Right, they're just more rare. And there's warlocks, which are mostly boys and only some girls, but a warlock's magic works differently than a witches magic." </p><p>"Can two boy witches have a baby? Or two warlocks?" </p><p>"There has to be a uterus involved."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"For witches, if you're two cis men, there's a work around if you have a willing surrogate. Rituals for warlocks are different in general, so I'm not sure what it's like on their end. It's not something that I've personally looked into for what I think are obvious reasons." </p><p>Raquel laughed. </p><p>"When you set the intention," Rio continued to explain, "you're inviting a soul in. There's different opinions on what's happening there. But sometimes the chromosomes rearrange." Rio wiggled her fingers theatrically. "And that's how two female witches can have a boy baby." </p><p>Raquel made a disgruntled noise. "That's so weird." </p><p>Rio shrugged. "Magic likes to take the path of least resistance. Maybe the magic that creates a baby is so powerful it can override the rules of science. Some people think it's fate or prearranged before we're born, who we will be and who our parents are. Others think that when the boy babies are made, it's a soul from the great beyond who wants to be born so much that he makes it happen." </p><p>"Like reincarnation?" Raquel asked. </p><p>"Some witches believe in that."</p><p>"Do you?" </p><p>Rio sat back a little in her chair. "Honestly? I'm not sure."</p><p>Raquel frowned. "You're a death doula." </p><p>Rio chuckled. "You'd think I'd have a better sense of the afterlife what with my job, but I don't." She smiled at Raquel and knew it was a little sad. "I'm very familiar with the death process but what happens after? It's a blank to me." </p><p>"What's the process like for you?" Raquel asked. </p><p>"Well, like we talked about..." </p><p>"No, not how it's going to be for me. What it's like for you." </p><p>"Hmm..." Rio shifted in the chair. Raquel looked at her expectantly. Rio let the silence draw out. When Raquel opened her mouth, Rio held up a finger. "I'm not trying to avoid the question. I'm thinking of how to explain." </p><p>"I know," Raquel said. She picked at the blanket across her lap. "You always answer my questions." </p><p>"It's literally my job," Rio said and Raquel cracked a little smile. They sat in silence for a few long moments as Rio gathered her thoughts. </p><p>"I guess..." Rio finally started. "What does it feel like for you to use your magic, when you're able to use it?" </p><p>Raquel bit her lip. "It hurts a lot of the time. Because I'm so sick." </p><p>"Sure, it's your body trying to keep you from using all of your energy." </p><p>"But when I was little, it felt warm and safe. I would draw little protection circles around my stuffed animals to protect them from my brother." Raquel grinned a little at the memory. </p><p>"That's adorable," Rio said, picturing a little Raquel carefully drawing her circles with chalk around her stuffies. </p><p>"Yeah," Raquel said. "I was a cute kid. So, your magic?" </p><p>Rio hummed a little. "Green magic is two sided. Life and death, right?" </p><p>Raquel nodded. </p><p>"It's a cycle. From life to death and from death, life. They feel and look a little different from one another, but when I reach for them, it's that same sort of feeling. Warm. Safe." Rio shifted in her seat. Not uncomfortable, per say, but unsure how Raquel would react to the next part. "Because of the death magic, I work closely with Lady Death." </p><p>"Oh," Raquel said, in awe. "The Lady Death?" </p><p>"Yes," Rio said. </p><p>"Can you see her? What does she look like?" </p><p>"I think she looks a little different for everyone. I'm not even certain she's a she for everyone. But my teacher when I was growing up, the one who taught me Green Magic, I mean, is Mexican and she introduced me to her tradition, the Santa Muerte. And I think that informs how I percieve Lady Death." Rio smiled a little. "My family taught me what we know of the Taino God of Death, who is a man and has a dog that guards the spirit realm. So sometimes, when Lady Death appears for me, she has a dog that looks like Opiyelguabirán."</p><p>"And you'll be able to see her? When she comes to get me?" </p><p>Rio nodded. "I see her when it's time for any of my patients to pass on. She enters the room and that's how I know it's time. If needed, I feed a little of my death magic to my patient so that it's an easy transition. But usually, once she's there, it's time to go." </p><p>"What's she like?" </p><p>Rio shrugged. "A little imposing. I've never had a conversation with her, but I greet her properly when she appears." </p><p>"And does it hurt? When you use your death magic on a patient?" </p><p>"No," Rio said, as comfortingly as she could. "It's warm. It tickles a little." </p><p>Raquel giggled. </p><p>"Having never been on the receiving end myself, I can't say what it feels like for my patients. But they never seem in pain. They always seem peaceful after I've fed it to them." </p><p>"Okay," Raquel said. "I'm glad the magic is nice for you to use. I thought it would be, you know, scary." </p><p>"Death is part of life," Rio said. "It's not scary. It just is." She checked her phone to see the time. "Now our time is almost up. What can I do to make you more comfortable before I go?" </p><p> </p><p>Raquel's mom, Alba, was outside the hospital room when Rio exited. She smiled a little at Rio, but in that strained way, when someone is overwhelmed with stress and is trying not to show it. "How was she?" </p><p>"She was great," Rio said. Patients were easy, their families could be harder. She focused on the spot between Alba's eyebrows in order to mimic eye contact. "She had good energy and we talked for a while. I helped her change her socks before I went. We talked a little about the death process again. And also, in case she mentions it, how two female witches can have a baby." </p><p>Raquel's mom gave a startled little laugh. "Oh, gods. How did that come up?" </p><p>Rio smiled sheepishly. "She, uh. Saw the sonogram I have as my background." </p><p>"Oh," Raquel's mom said, her eyes widening. "Congratulations." </p><p>"Thank you. I'm not the one pregnant, so I'm not quite sure what parental leave will look like. I'll communicate with you as we get closer." </p><p>"Right," Raquel's mom said. Her lips thinned a little. "How long?" </p><p>"Sixish months until the due date.  Like I said, I will communicate with all of my patients. My current plan is to not take anyone new on, so I will just have my current patients to focus on. And I'll make arrangements with another doula if I'm going to be out." </p><p>Alba sighed. "You should be out, taking care of your partner." </p><p>"Well, that's only if she wants to be taken care of," Rio said, only half joking. "And I'd rather avoid leaving my patients with someone else, even my very capable colleagues, unless it's absolutely necessary." Rio double checked that she had all of her items and then turned back to Raquel's mom. "I'll be here next week at our usual time, but as always, please call me if anyone needs anything."</p><p>"Of course, thank you Rio." Alba's face seemed a little lighter and she returned Rio's wave as Rio leaves. </p><p> </p><p>Rio found a pregnancy app that was not super in her face about "being pregnant." She checked it each morning when she got up, reading about how the baby is developing (The baby can make sucking movements. The baby's eyelids have formed. The baby has teeth??? That feels weirdly too soon). Despite her wanting to text Agatha about every little thing, like how they'd be able to see the baby's toes at the next ultrasound, she held herself back. </p><p>Rio's friend Yelena's sister-in-law had baby number three a year ago. Rio assumed that Yelena mentioned Rio's impending motherhood to said sister, sister-in-law, and their husband at some point, because the next time she visited she brought over two duffel bags filled with infant supplies and said, "They swear it's the last one and you can have literally everything" before tossing the duffel bags onto Rio's living room floor. "Give them a day and they'll load the truck up and bring everything else over for you." </p><p>"Uhhhhh," Rio said, very much not expecting a mid week delivery of baby supplies. "Thank you? And them? I think maybe the truck should wait until I move." </p><p>Yelena grunted. "Well, I'll tell Natasha that. Though she might start pitching stuff in celebration of being done with the infant stage. Also, all three of them said that you should start buying diapers when they're on sale. Get a stockpile." </p><p>Sure, made sense. Rio was getting a lot of unsolicited advice these days, but most of it was useful. She cleared out a corner of her bedroom and began to compile the diapers bought on sale, the supplies passed on from Yelena's family, and the occasional adorable outfit or toy she couldn't keep herself from buying. </p><p>Agatha had just entered the second trimester when Alice's birthday rolled around. It wasn't a milestone birthday, so Alice simply sent out a mass text that invited everyone to her apartment the weekend after her birthday for drinks, dinner, and dessert. Rio took one look at the list of numbers that had also received the text and promptly sent Alice a message outside of the text chain. </p><p>
<em>Rio: Are you getting RSVPs for your party? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Yeah, but only to know how much food to have. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: It's not going to be a big group, if you're worried about that. You've met everyone at one point or another.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Will you let me know Agatha's RSVP?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Why would you need to know it? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: I don't want to start issues. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I thought you two were getting along?????</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: We are! </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Just you know. I don't want to make things awkward. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: You both are my friends and I want you BOTH at my party </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: You guys can get it together an be mature, reasonable, adults for one night </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: You're literally having a baby together. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Not to mention that it's my fucking birthday!!!!</em>
</p><p>Rio gnawed at her lip for a moment before texting Alice in response. </p><p>
<em>Rio: I don't want to make her uncomfortable. Not just because of the baby. You know how she gets when she feels like shes been backed into a corner. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I know. But it's my birthday</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Pregnant or not, I'll kick her out if she starts something,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: That goes for you too. I will also kick you out if you start something. Just watch me. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: lol ok. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: If you're sure. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: It has just become my single most birthday wish. You and Agatha, at my party, being polite and behaving yourselves. Best gift I can receive. </em>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but sent Alice a thumbs up emoji anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Rio got to the party a little late (68-year-old Reynolds had gone peacefully. His family had cried, but he'd been in so much pain, it was more out of relief. His wife had kissed Rio on both cheeks and thanked her). It was a small party, just Alice's closest of friends, so while everyone was well into their drinks and finishing the appetizers when Rio walked in, it was still fairly chill and quiet. Alice sprung out of her seat when Rio entered and gave her a huge hug, which Rio returned. She tried to pass Alice her present, as Alice scowled at her. </p><p>"Thought I told you your presence was my one and only birthday wish," she said. </p><p>Rio wiggled the present a little. "But I picked it out special and I know it's something you'll like." </p><p>Alice took it with a grumble and put it in the corner with the rest of her presents. Rio gravitated into the rest of the group and gave everyone a hesitant smile. "Sorry. Work."  </p><p>"And how was the Lady Death?" Lila asked, raising her cup towards Rio in greeting. </p><p>Rio shrugged. "She stared at me unnervingly. It's kind of her thing. How was all of your days?" </p><p>There was a chorus of positives from most of the group, but Agatha frowned. </p><p>"What's up?" Rio asked. </p><p>"Agatha was just complaining about how expensive diapers are," Jen helpfully explained. </p><p>"Oh, yeah," Rio said, nodding in agreement. Alice brought a chair over and Rio took it gratefully. Once she was seated, she elaborated "Every time I run errands, I check and see if there's a sale. I'm getting quite the stack in the corner of my bedroom. Victoria hisses at them each time she's out of her tank." </p><p>Agatha got a little wide in the eyes. "You're buying diapers already?" </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. "I figure, if I space the purchases out, maybe I won't give myself such heart palpitations with how much everything costs." </p><p>"Hm," Agatha said. </p><p>"How bad is it, really?" Alice asked. </p><p>Rio shrugged. "Like I said, I think if I get a jump on sales it won't be so bad. And I got lucky that my friend Yelena's sister has a bunch of baby stuff she's off loading. Having a kid is expensive though. Agatha is right to complain about diaper costs." She noticed then that Agatha's face had taken on a pinched look. Rio tried to think. Had she broken one of the rules with her comment? Maybe Rule 4? She wasn't sure, so she decided to change the subject. "Alice, you said there would be drinks?" </p><p>"In the kitchen," Alice said, gesturing her on. "Want me to grab you some?" </p><p>"The birthday girl fetch me a drink? Absolutely not," Rio exclaimed, as she rose from her seat. "Anybody want me to bring something back, though?" </p><p>When she received the couple of requests, she headed into the kitchen to peruse the selection at hand. She ended up with a hard seltzer (she did have to drive home at the end of the party, after all) and was looking for a pineapple one for Lilia, when Jen walked in. Rio gave her a little nod and said "Hey." </p><p>"Hello," Jen said. She gestured towards the hard seltzers. "Lilia changed her mind and sent me in for something different." </p><p>"Oh, sure" Rio said, stepping out of the way. "Have at it."</p><p>"Cool, thanks," Jen said, beginning to rummage in the cooler. </p><p>Rio nodded, figuring that was the end of the short conversation. She grabbed one of the grapefruit seltzers and went to turn out of the room when Jen asked, "How're you doing? With everything?" </p><p>Rio paused. She let her fingers drum against the sides of the can. "Good?" she said, her voice raising on the end of like the word was a question. </p><p>Jen fully stood up, Lilia's drink in hand. "That doesn't sound very sure." </p><p>Rio shrugged. "You know, I'm just. Adjusting." </p><p>"Pregnancy is a big adjustment," Jen said, some of her doctor tone coloring her voice. "Or so it's been expressed by my patients." </p><p>"Right," Rio agreed. "It really has been." </p><p>Jen was still looking at her, with that same look she'd given Rio in her office, like she was expecting Rio to say or feel more. Rio wasn't sure what to do with this conversation. It was the second time Jen had been pleasant, even nice to her. Rio could explain away the office niceties as professionalism, but now, at a mutual friend's birthday party? It seemed even more notable. </p><p>"It's just not how I pictured having a kid," Rio finally said. </p><p>"Yeah?" Jen asked. She leaned against the counter and seemed genuinely interested in what Rio had to say. "I get that, most people expect to have a kid with someone they're actively in a relationship with. Every time there's some sort of baby mama or daddy situation in the office....yeah, the dynamic is weird."</p><p>Rio nodded, maybe a little overeager. "Yeah, you've seen it. It's definitely like that. I  always assumed the kid's other parent would at least be able to tolerate me." </p><p>Jen's face seemed to fall a little, almost sad. "You both seemed to get along ok at the appointment," she said. </p><p>Was that sad expression <em>pity</em>? If so, that made Rio uncomfortable. She shuffled her feet a little.  "That was an appointment for the kid, you know?" </p><p>"Is that not normally how your interactions go?" Jen asked. </p><p>Rio shook her head. "Most of the time I don't hear from her unless it's a cost that needs to be split or an appointment coming up." Her fingers had been drumming this entire time against the sides of the can, she realized. She tried to cease the movement. "So, I'm just focusing on doing what I can to be the best parent possible, you know?" </p><p>There was a sound at the doorway and Rio turned to see Agatha. She still had that weird pinched look on her face. Rio didn't know what to make of it. </p><p>"Hi Agatha," Jen said, before turning back to Rio. "I can send you some resources that I usually hand out to patients. You can always text me, too, if you have questions." </p><p>Rio gave her a little smile. "Thanks Jen. I appreciate it." She nodded at Agatha and headed back over to the dining table where Alice and the rest of the party were. Rio wasn't quite sure what to make Jen's offer to help, but, well. It took a village and all. </p><p>It wasn't later, until she got back home and was thinking the party over, that she realized Agatha had been uncharacteristically quiet the entire night. </p><p> </p><p>The weeks passed. Agatha invited Rio to her 20 week appointment and Rio managed to make it work with her schedule. </p><p>Jen asked for the usual updates, explained the testing they would be doing, and then posed the question. </p><p>"Will we be learning the gender today?" </p><p>That hadn't been discussed between them. Rio turned to Agatha, who shook her head. "No, I don't want to know yet." Her lips thinned in discomfort, presumably because of both Rio and Jen looking at her. Rio looked away from Agatha and back to Jen. </p><p>"Rio?" Jen prompted. </p><p>"What Agatha says goes," Rio responded, even though she was burning with curiosity. </p><p>Jen had nodded and when the ultrasound tech came in, merely pointed to the baby's developing limbs and face. Rio left with a new sonogram, which she texted to Alice and Lilia before setting it as the lock screen on her phone. </p><p>Autumn began to properly set in. Rio's magic started to get a little weird around the fall equinox as the power built in preparation for Halloween night. The second week of October, Lilia texted her about making preparations for the upcoming holiday. </p><p>
<em>Lilia: Hello my dear! Jen and I will be holding a little gathering for Halloween. Just us, Alice, Agatha, and hopefully you. Let us know if you can make it and if not, what your plans are for the evening. I'd hate for you to be alone while the spirits are out visiting! </em>
</p><p>Rio pondered. For Green witches, the Spring Equinox and Halloween were the holidays that took the most toll. The Spring Equinox, rife with fertility and so many things growing, could stretch her magic thin, but Halloween could be dangerous, with the spirits of the dead returning to visit Earth. Green witches, with their connection to the cycle of life and death, could be more susceptible to possession. It was best practice to spend the evening with a coven or at least a protection witch to help prevent this or, one could do what Rio had done last year, take a sleep aid so they were not awake for any moments of the holiday. </p><p>It would be better to be with a group of others, under Alice's protection. Not to mention, Rio enjoyed the ancestor honoring aspects of the holiday. When she'd decided to decline Lilia's invitation the previous year in order to not share space with Agatha, her sleeping through the night had knocked her magic off kilter. It had been sluggish and slow to respond for a week after. </p><p>So, she texted Lilia back <em>Thank you for the invite! I think I should be free. </em></p><p>
<em>Lilia: Excellent! Bring dishes for your ancestors!</em>
</p><p>Rio found herself looking forward to the gathering, as she prepped her costume and determined the Puerto Rican food she would bring (she eventually settled on arroz con dulce, since it had been a favorite of her father's ). She texted Alice about what costume Alice was wearing (and was repeatedly rebuffed) and tried not to think too much about the costumes she and Agatha had worn together when they had been dating. </p><p>And then, on Halloween, Raquel died. </p><p>Rio had known for the past week that it had been coming, as Raquel's body slowed and she spent more time sleeping than awake. She was sedated at the end, but not before her family and friends had had the opportunity to say their good-byes. Rio had been holding Raquel's hand when Lady Death entered the room. She'd squeezed Raquel's hand and then looked straight into the Lady's eyes and said "Take care of her. She's special." </p><p>The Lady had merely blinked. Alba had begun to sob and Raquel's hand went fully limp in hers. Rio hadn't even needed to use her death magic to ease the transition.</p><p>Rio tried to not have favorites, but. Kids and teens were always hard. And Raquel had been a great kid, even through her time in hospice. Smart and sweet. She would've been a great witch, if she'd gotten the chance. </p><p>Suffice to say, Rio was not in the mood to go to Lilia's. Rather, she went home, took a shower, and sat on the couch in a lump until the vibrating of her phone finally got to her. </p><p>
<em>Alice: Riiiiiioooooo</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Riiiiiiiiiiiioooooooooo</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I thought you were coming where are youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu</em>
</p><p>
<em>[One missed call from Alice]</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: We don't want to get started properly without you Rio. Call or text me back so that we know when you'll get here. </em>
</p><p>
<em>[One missed call from Lilia]</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lilia: Hi dear! If you were invited to another party, let me know. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Rio. Seriously. Text or call me back. I'm worried. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Do you need me to come and pick you up? I can do it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: Rio. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: RIO. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You know it's not safe for you to spend Halloween alone. </em>
</p><p>That text made Rio jolt out of her skin. Agatha? Breaking her own no contact rule? Inconceivable. But that gave her the push to text the group chat back.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Rough day at work. I'm not up for a gathering. I'll see you all another time. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: RIO. NO. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: I AM COMING TO GET YOU BE READY.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: You can't say no to meeeeeee</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice: ETA 25 minutes BE READY TO GO WHEN I GET THERE</em>
</p><p>Rio threw her phone down and then herself across the couch. She lay there, wallowing, until she heard Alice knocking on her door once, twice, then a third time. At the fourth knock that was becoming more of a bang, Rio drug herself over to the door to open in. Alice stood there, dressed in a costume that reminded Rio of the cover of an MCR album, glaring. </p><p>"Took you long enough," she groused. She stared at Rio in her hoodie and sweatpants. "Where's your costume?" </p><p>"I'm not feeling up to it, Alice," Rio explained. She rubbed her forehead. "Seriously. Rough day at work doesn't even begin to cover it." </p><p>"Rio," Alice said, as though Rio was a child, "if you're not in a costume, you're going to end up sharing space in your body with great-great-grandma Vidal. Think of how disappointed she'll be, an unmarried woman in your late 20s. You don't want that. So go put yours on." </p><p>Rio thought back to the intricate spider costume she had in her bedroom. The thought of putting in on and arranging all the arms was exhausting. "Alice, I'm really not feeling up to dress up and make merry, ok? One of my teens died." </p><p>Alice's face softened. "Ok. So. White shirt, black pants. I know Lilia has an FBI badge in her costumes box. Easiest costume in the world." When Rio just stood here, she added, "Either you put on your costume and come with me or I'm drawing the world's smallest protection circle here in this entry way, so that you'll be stuck here until dawn breaks." </p><p>"Fine," Rio said, conceding. "I'll do the white shirt thing. Give me a minute." </p><p>She turned and went back to her bedroom. Victoria hissed a little from the plant she was sitting in and Rio plucked her up. She stroked a little over Victoria's furry body. "Pórtate bien," she instructed, before putting Victoria into her tank. "Enjoy the visits from your ancestors, if that's a thing that tarantulas can do." </p><p>Rio put on what Alice had told her to. White blouse, black pants, and she twisted her hair up into a claw clip. She stepped out of her bedroom to find Alice scrolling on her phone on her couch. Alice breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Rio. "Let's go. I didn't start laying the protection circle, so we need to hurry." </p><p>"Ok," Rio said, grabbing her bag and her phone. She followed Alice down the stairs, where Alice swept her into the car with a dramatic gesture. Rio rolled her eyes at it but let herself smile when Alice walked around to the driver's car. </p><p>"I am really sorry about your patient," Alice said, once she started driving. "That really sucks." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. "She was a great kid. I really liked her. I told Lady Death she was something special." </p><p>Alice's jaw dropped. "You....talked. To Lady Death. On Halloween." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. </p><p>"Rio, do you have a death wish?" </p><p>"What? No."</p><p>"You spoke to Lady Death. On Halloween." </p><p>"It's not dangerous," Rio said, "to talk to her. Anyone can."</p><p>"On Halloween, though? What did she say?"</p><p>"She didn't say anything back," Rio said, slumping in her seat. "She never does." </p><p>Alice muttered something under her breath that Rio couldn't make out and was silent the rest of the way to Lilia's.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing Alice did was dig through Lilia's costume box until she came up with the FBI badge for Rio. Rio slipped it on over her head and adjusted the string so it wasn't crazy long. </p><p>"There," Alice said. "No way great-great-grandma Vidal will know who you are in that killer costume." </p><p>Rio poked her tongue into her cheek to stifle her laugh. </p><p>"You want a drink?" Alice asked. </p><p>Rio shook her head. "Hospice care rules. You don't drink when you're upset. It's a slippery slope." </p><p>"Sure," Alice said. "Well, it can be you and Agatha as the sober ones tonight." </p><p>Rio's stomach twisted unpleasantly. "Sure," she said. "Me and Agatha. The two sober ones." </p><p>"Well, at least I know you're here to DD if we need it." Alice lightly shoved at her shoulder. "Come on, come downstairs. Let everyone see your costume." </p><p>"My haphazard costume," Rio muttered. </p><p>"Your super hot haphazard costume," Alice said. She pulled Rio down the stairs, with Rio stumbling after her. </p><p>Lilia hugged her when she emerged downstairs. "It's so nice to have a complete coven again," she said. </p><p>"I was there at the summer solstice," Rio reminded her. </p><p>Lilia waved her off. "That's a much bigger party, this is just for us. I'm glad that you and Agatha have worked things out with one another." </p><p>"We're not...together, Lilia. You know that, right?" </p><p>Lilia's gaze could be disconcerting when she turned it all on you. "What? Yes, I know that you're not together now," she said. </p><p>Rio decided that if she dwelled on that "now" comment, she would go crazy. In hopes of changing the subject, she asked "I didn't do a good job of feeding myself today. What do you have on offer?" and followed Lilia into her dining room to partake in the food she had left out. It was Sicilian, for Lilia's ancestors, and Rio happily made herself a plate. Lilia or Jen had not only put her food out to share, but had placed an offering portion on her behalf on their ancestor altar. Rio was pleased by the sight. </p><p>She was halfway through her plate of food when there was a soft "Oh" behind her and she turned to see Agatha. Agatha was also wearing a simple costume, a jack-o-lantern shirt where the face curved perfectly over her small baby bump. Rio couldn't help her eyes from flickering between Agatha's face and stomach and Agatha's face seemed to harden in response.  "You made it." </p><p>Rio froze with a spoonful of rice halfway to her mouth. "You...texted me?" she said, her statement turning into a question in her confusion. </p><p>Agatha's face was unreadable. "You should be in the protection circle," she said. </p><p>"Yeah, well. No spirit is going to come for me while I'm out here eating," Rio said. She suddenly realized that she was breaking Rule 4 (though Agatha had broken it first) and clamped her mouth shut. </p><p>"Right," Agatha said, skeptically. "Because a spirit will definitely follow the rules like that." </p><p>Rio shrugged and went back to eating. She felt Agatha's eyes on her for a long moment until she finally stepped away and Rio was able to breath a sigh of relief. </p><p>She was scrapping the last few grains of rice up when Alice called out "Ok! The protection circle is finished! Come one, come all!" </p><p>Rio trashed her plate and headed towards Alice's voice, where presumably the circle was. </p><p>It turned out that Agatha was right to be concerned. There was an odd whooshing sound and Rio was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Spirit possession was fucking <em>weird</em>. </p><p>Things came to Rio in flashes. Were her limbs moving? She wasn't sure. There was a distinct feeling of being out of control of her motions. She hoped that no one came near her so she wouldn't hurt them if she was flailing around. The feeling of her skin felt like the awful sensory experience of touching a cotton ball, except it was covering her entire body. She shouted into her mind <em>Who are you? Who are you? What is your purpose?</em> But at first, she heard no response besides the roaring in her head. </p><p>The spirit coalesced in her minds eye. Long gray hair. Blue eyes that Rio knew and loved so well, but so much crueler. A sneer on her mouth. </p><p>This. <em>Fucking. </em>Bitch. </p><p>It was a little funny, how the two of them roared "How dare you!" at the same time, though. </p><p>"Get out! Get out of me! I cast you out!" Rio shrieked at the same time Evanora howled "You whore! You despicable! How dare you put your hands on my daughter!" </p><p>If Rio could move her hands properly, she knew they'd be curled into fists. "She put her hands on me first!" she snapped. </p><p>"Who are you? What is your bloodline? You have corrupted the Harkness line-" </p><p>"Oh fuck you," Rio spit. "It's only because of me that your precious Harkness line will live on. That is your legacy, you asshole. It takes two parents to make a baby." Maybe she could feel her fists. Maybe they were clenched. "I thought you told Agatha that she was born evil. That you never wanted her. You want to claim her now? After all of that?" </p><p>"You fool," Evanora said. In her mouth, the word <em>fool </em>sounded like a curse. "He has been waiting to be born for centuries. And of all the mothers he could have chosen, he chose you. You rotten, filthy—"</p><p><em>He. </em>The pronoun reverberated in Rio's mind. <em>We're having a boy. </em></p><p>Oh Divine Mother, Agatha would be the most insufferable boy mom, wouldn't she? </p><p>"Is that it?" Rio managed, cutting off Evanora's tirade about how Rio was poisoning her grandson's blood stream. "You're possessing me now because you're what? Jealous that someone actually chose your daughter for once? Is that it?" </p><p>"I've come to remind her what she is, who her family is." </p><p>"No, no way." Rio stood her ground, as well as she could in this strange liminal space. "You can't have her. She doesn't belong to you. Her <em>child</em> doesn't belong to you." </p><p>The ghost hissed like a demon. Rio laughed. "You think you scare me?" she said. "You're an old, dead woman who is cared for by no one. My tarantula is scarier than you."</p><p>Evanora lunged and Rio considered that it probably wasn't smart to taunt the person that was currently possessing her body. Lesson learned. </p><p>She deflected as well as she could before throwing herself at Evanora. Whatever weird space (was it in her brain? Another plane of existence? Rio still wasn't sure) they were in seemed to have some sort of floor. She brought Evanora down onto it with a crash the reverberated through both of their bodies. She wrestled for control but the old woman was wily and fought her back.</p><p>Rio managed to push her full body weight into Evanora's shoulders and pinned her. Evanora hissed and scraped her nails across Rio's face. Rio winced at the pain, but did her best to not lose her grip. </p><p>"You are not welcome here, I do not welcome you, I cast you out," she said, then repeated it again. "You are not welcome here, I do not welcome you, I cast you out." She narrowly avoided dodging a headbutt from Evanora. "Divine Fucking Mother, will nothing stop you, woman?" </p><p>The spirit of Evanora barred her teeth at her once again, then flipped Rio over. Rio shrieked and thrashed, wriggling out of Evanora's grip faster than she could hold her. "I cast you out, I cast you out, I cast you out," she repeated hastily, the words running together. She slammed her hand into Evanora's solar plexus as hard as she could and the woman howled in pain. </p><p>There was a shift in the air, or whatever could be called the space surrounding her. Evanora froze and then disappeared. Rio found herself on the ground, gasping, She turned and froze herself, seeing Lady Death in front of her. The woman, if she could be called that, stared at her impassively. It was hard to read feelings off of a face made of bone. </p><p>Tentatively, Rio asked "Is it time?" Her heart stuttered a little at the thought. She'd fully accepted her future passing that would one day come, but for it to be now? To never meet her son (her son, she was going to be the mother of a <em>son)</em>? It gave her a great heartache. </p><p>Lady Death blinked, in what Rio felt was surprise. "No," she said, her voice reverberating through the space. "It is not your time yet." </p><p>"Ok," Rio said, her breathing evening out. She knew better than to ask when her life would end. She licked her lips. "You have graced me with your presence. I..." she stopped, not knowing how to phrase the question politely. "If I may ask, my Lady, if I am not dying, why are you here?" </p><p>There was a pause. Then Lady Death spoke. "You crossed over the veil. You should be more careful." </p><p>"I think," Rio said, carefully, "it wasn't so much I crossed over as I was pushed." </p><p>Lady Death laughed. It wasn't a cruel sound, though it echoed through the space. Rio resisted the urge to cover her ears, worried that the Lady might be insulted by the movement. </p><p>"You need to have more precautions against the spirits on Halloween, Green Witch." </p><p>Rio nodded. "I'll take more care in the future." </p><p>Lady Death continued to stare at her until she too disappeared, leaving Rio on the ground of the dark space she had found herself then. </p><p>It was then that the memory rushed in. </p><p>
<em>"You need to pay better attention," Agatha lectured, as she supported Rio's hobbling to the bathroom. "Look, you're all scraped up. What would you do without someone to help you?" </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Die, I guess," Rio said, laughing. Everything was so funny. She felt a bit lightheaded, as her magic and Agatha's magic swirled around and over their bodies. It was still tangled from when the magic had crashed into each other, when they were outside. Rio wondered what color purple and green would make when the magics mixed together.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha frowned. "Why are you laughing?" She still sounded drunk. Maybe even a little drunker than she'd sounded outside. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio laughed again. "The drinks are strong," she said, drawling out the word until she could barely remember what she had originally said. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Mm," Agatha agreed. The door to the bathroom was open and Agatha pushed Rio in a little hard. Rio stumbled again. Agatha pointed to the toilet. "Sit there before you hurt yourself again," she instructed. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ok," Rio readily agreed, sitting down. She fought the urge to fidget as Agatha looked over her knees and hands. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Well, you didn't break the skin," Agatha said. She rooted under the sink, banging her hand a couple of times and swearing, before she came up with an alcohol wipe. "Use this to get the dirt off." </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ok," Rio agreed for the second time. She took the wipe from Agatha's hands, their fingers brushing. An electric current ran down her spine and settled, pooling, in between her legs. Rio licked her lips, maintaining eye contact with Agatha as she wiped her hands and knees off. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha began to fidget. "Is it hot in here? It feels hot." She began to pull at the collar of her shirt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The voice that left Rio's mouth didn't feel like it came from her body. "You can take it off," she said. Agatha didn't even hesitate and yanked her shirt off. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Even in this memory, Rio couldn't tell who had moved first. But her lips were on Agatha's, Agatha was pushing her tongue into Rio's mouth, and Rio had Agatha up against the sink. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Rio Rio Rio," Agatha was murmuring, over and and over again, her words slurring together. Rio didn't hesitate. She was unbuttoning Agatha's pants, shoving her underwear away, and finding Agatha's clit with her fingers. She felt like a woman possessed. She could still feel her magic and Agatha's, moving in time with her fingers.  It felt....it felt...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wrapped a hand around the back of Rio's neck and pulled her face in closer. She broke the kiss to pant into Rio's mouth. "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." Her voice cracked. Rio wasn't sure she'd ever heard Agatha beg that ardently before.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio obliged, sliding two of her fingers into Agatha. The angle was all wrong, and normally her wrist would be cramping, but she couldn't feel it. She could just feel Agatha. Agatha's breath, Agatha's hand on the back of her neck, Agatha's cunt wrapped around her hand, Agatha's magic. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Her hand moved exactly the way that Agatha had always liked it. They kissed until Agatha couldn't anymore and then they just panted into each others mouths while Agatha whined and gasped. Everything was so much, Rio was feeling everything all at once, and then. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha came, gasping out Rio's name. She clenched down on Rio's fingers, hard. Rio gentled her touch, guided Agatha through it, as Agatha's body spasmed over and over. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Agatha," Rio whispered. She pressed a kiss to Agatha's slack mouth once, twice. She felt full up with their magic, felt even drunker on it than she had felt with just the drink in her system. She kissed Agatha a third time, Agatha's mouth finally responding again to hers as she rallied. "Fuck," Rio murmured against Agatha's mouth. "I want to see you come again, let me fuck you again." </em>
</p><p>
<em>Her fingers twisted in Agatha, searching again for the right spot, the right rhythm to bring Agatha to the brink. But Agatha put a hand against her shoulder, pushing her up, and putting some distance between them. Rio stopped her movements just long enough for Agatha to push her own hand into Rio's pants. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio's hips jerked. "Agatha," she whined out. Everything felt so strong, too strong. Agatha pulled her back in, Rio's hand pinned between them, unable to move, as Agatha found her clit and began to rub. Once…twice…then Rio's orgasm crashed into her so quickly all she could do was gasp out Agatha's name over and over again. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Agatha, Agatha, Agatha," she cried, her hips jolting. Agatha shushed her and soothed her through it, her free hand gentle on Rio's head. Rio pressed her mouth sloppily to Agatha's face, kissing whatever part of Agatha's skin and hair she could reach. The words fell from her mouth without a single thought behind them. "I've missed you, I've missed you so much. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything." She pressed another kiss to Agatha's mouth, moving too fast for Agatha to reciprocate. "Come home with me? Please. Let me go home with you." </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha's hand was pulled from Rio's pants quickly. In response, Rio let her fingers slide from Agatha's body. The pleasure had fallen from Agatha's face and she was looking at Rio with an emotion that Rio, in her state, was utterly failing to read. </em>
</p><p>
<em>"Don't," Agatha said, her voice uncertain. Rio stepped back. The space between them felt like a gaping cavern, even though it was a foot of distance at most.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Agatha," Rio said, unsure. "Are you ok?" </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha licked her lips. She gazed around the bathroom. Her expression wasn't confused, per se, but it seemed as though she was having a dawning realization. She quickly pulled up her underwear, then stopped, hesitating. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio's stomach dropped. "Agatha, I....Agatha, I'm sorry. Did I...?" </em>
</p><p>
<em>This was the part she had remembered before, through her cloudy memory. Agatha's face twisting, snarling, "I thought I told you I never wanted to see your face. This was a mistake." She hopped down off the sink and pushed Rio back, so she could make her way to the door. </em>
</p><p>
<em>But what Rio hadn't remembered was Agatha's unsteady movements to the door, the way her hand had fluttered on the knob. Agatha had turned back. "You missed me?" she asked. The intoxicated slur that had been in her voice seemed to lift for a moment, her speech almost normal.  </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio felt herself nod, violently. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha's grip on the door tightened and then, she was through. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio had stood in the bathroom for several long moments, before she could bring herself to wash off her hands. Everything after that blurred, until she found herself in the Uber on the way home. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Her magic never stopped the swirling and feeling tangled with Agatha's, even when she crashed into bed and immediately fell asleep. </em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio first became aware of someone lightly shaking her shoulders, then of a voice repeating her name over and over. </p><p>"Rio? Rio can you hear me? Rio?" </p><p>Something was dripping down the lower half of her face. She licked at it and came away tasting pennies. </p><p>"I'm ok," she slurred. Or at least she thought she did. </p><p>The voice sounded like it was crying. "Rio, are you awake? Can you hear me?" </p><p>Rio slit her eyes open. She felt drained, like she had run a marathon and then collapsed immediately afterward. Her eyes tried to focus, but all she could see was a brown head of hair belonging to the person shaking her shoulders. </p><p>Agatha? </p><p>Rio tried to sit up and immediately felt dizzy. She let herself slide back down to the floor. </p><p>"Agatha," she heard Jen say, softly. "Move so I can look Rio over, ok?" </p><p>There was a hesitation, then Agatha slid out of the way so that Jen could move into her space. "Hey Rio," Jen said gently. It was the gentlest Rio had ever heard Jen speak to her. "Where'd you go?" </p><p>"The void," Rio groaned. "Spirit tried to possess me." She licked her lips again without thinking and tasted more of her blood. "What did you see here?" </p><p>"I didn't see much," Jen said. "We just heard a loud crash from the kitchen and found you on the floor. You were shaking like you were having a seizure, so I started seizure protocol before Lilia realized it was magical in nature. Then we dragged you to Alice's protection circle and your body calmed down." </p><p>Rio coughed. "Did I hurt anybody?" </p><p>"Probably some bruises on us all," Jen noted. "But no lasting damage." </p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio said at the same moment she heard Agatha gasp out, "Jen! Why would you tell her that? You're making it sound like it's her fault-" </p><p>Jen cut her off. "I'm not in the habit of lying to my patients." </p><p>"Rio isn't your patient, she's our friend--" </p><p>"Alice," Jen said, her tone commanding. "Take Agatha to go find something to clean up Rio's face. I think her nose bleed is finishing up." </p><p>Rio could hear Alice's hushed tone juxtaposed against Agatha's arguing. It seemed that whatever Alice said won out and the two of them walked out of the room. </p><p>"I'll put out another offering," Lilia said, rising, "for the Lady. You don't have to worry about it, Rio." </p><p>"Thanks Lilia," Rio said, absently. </p><p>"I think you'll be ok," Jen said, quietly. Her hands were gentle on Rio's head. "You'll probably feel like you have a hell of a hangover tomorrow. Or so I've been told when there's spirit possession." </p><p>"Thanks," Rio managed. Her body ached and when she tried to stretch, it's painful enough that she groaned. "I already feel like I've been hit by a truck." </p><p>"I think that's normal," Jen said. Alice and Agatha returned with a damp washcloth, which was passed to Jen, who began to methodically clean off Rio's face. </p><p>"Can I go home?" Rio asked, once the cleaning was done. "I feel like I need to sleep for a week." </p><p>Jen opened her mouth, but was quickly cut off by Agatha. </p><p>"No," she declared. Rio rolled slightly over so she could better see Agatha's facial expression, which was hard as stone. Maybe harder, like some sort of quartz or granite (Rio was vaguely aware she was delirious).  </p><p>"Agatha," Alice murmured. "This is literally Jen's job." </p><p>"Rio isn't an expectant mother," Agatha retorted. </p><p>"Agatha--</p><p>"I wouldn't recommend going home by yourself," Jen hedged, ignoring the escalating fight happening behind her. "Just because of all of the factors. What night it is, your powers, et cetera. If Alice is willing to go home with you, maybe." </p><p>"Or I could put you in my room for the time being," Alice offered. </p><p>"I'm not going to kick you out of your bed," Rio said. </p><p>Alice shrugged. "No need for that. Let me go change the sheets and do a chalk circle and then we can go from there. Agatha," she demanded, "come help me." </p><p>Agatha looked like she wanted to continue their argument but when Alice made grabbing hands at her, she sighed and followed out. </p><p>Rio felt too tired to keep her eyes open and she let them drift shut. Next to her, Lilia returned and began to hum, contently and perfectly on key. Jen also disappeared and came back. Rio cracked her eyes open enough to see that Jen had something in her hands. </p><p>"Apply this wherever you're most sore," she said. "20 minutes only and then take it off. I should see if Alice has any sort of heat pad too. If not, we can make one." </p><p>"Thanks," Rio said again. Jen handed over what she was holding, which ended up being an ice pack, wrapped carefully in a tea towel. Rio frowned a little. </p><p>"What's wrong?" Jen asked. She crouched on the floor by Rio's head and ran her fingers over it again. "Does something hurt?" </p><p>Whatever brain to mouth filter Rio would normally have seemed to be fully offline. "Why're you being nice to me?" </p><p>"Nice to you?" Jen echoed. Her fingers faltered for a moment before picking up their original movement. </p><p>"You don't like me." </p><p>Jen was silent. Lilia's humming stopped. It was quiet enough that Rio could hear Alice and Agatha, all the way down the hallway, rummaging around and talking quietly.</p><p>"I like you," Jen said. Rio began to protest, but Jen cut her off. "I'm not going to lie to you, Rio. I didn't always like you. I found you weird and off-putting. And your job freaked me out. But that's all on me. None of that is your fault." </p><p>"But you like me now?" Rio asked. </p><p>"Yes." </p><p>"I'm still weird and off-putting. And my job hasn't changed." </p><p>"Right," Jen said. </p><p>"So, what <em>did </em>change?" </p><p>Jen was quiet again. Her fingers fully lifted from Rio's head. Lilia resumed her humming. </p><p>"I didn't think you were good for Agatha. And now I do. So." Rio felt more than saw Jen shrugging. </p><p>"That's all?" Rio asked. </p><p>"Yes," Jen said. </p><p>"Just because you and Agatha are best friends or..." </p><p>"She's not my best friend," Jen said with a snort. </p><p>"Two of Cups," Lilia murmured. Rio couldn't see, but she could assume Jen was glaring at Lilia. A chuckle bubbled out of Rio's mouth at the thought. </p><p>Jen rocked back on her heels. "I admire how much effort you're putting into being a good parent to the baby," she said. "Do you know how many pregnant people come into my office with no one because their co-parent can't be fucking bothered? And you're showing up and being supportive even though you and Agatha aren't together anymore." She sighed. "And like, Agatha's a raging bitch on a good day, never mind being pregnant, and I know that's not easy. She hasn't been easy, the past few months. So I pity you, a little, and that makes me want to be nice to you." Rio could hear the scowl in Jen's voice. "It's a disgusting feeling, let me tell you." </p><p>"Would it help if I'm more weird and off-putting?" Rio offered. "I could hiss at you every time you talk to me, or something. Or talk to you in detail about the dying process." </p><p>"Ugh," Jen groaned. "I never want to hear that talk from you again. Which reminds me. I owe you pay back on that. I need to explain the childbirth and recovery process to you in detail. I hear it's bloodier and there's more screaming than your usual patients." </p><p>Rio felt the corners of her mouth shift up. "You're on. I bet I won't squirm once." </p><p>"You tell yourself that now," Jen said. "That just gives me more ammunition to make my descriptions even more gross." </p><p>Rio was still laughing a little when Alice reappeared.  </p><p>"Is Rio good?" </p><p>"She should be fine," Jen said, leveraging herself up to her feet and dusting off her hands. "I feel confident we don't need to go to the ER and I can safely turn her over to you." </p><p>"Alright," Alice said. "Come on, Rio. My bed is ready for you." </p><p>Rio wanted to make some sort of joke, but she didn't. She tried to lift her body off the floor, but found her muscles to be floppier than she expected. Alice leaned down to help pull her up and there was a second set of hands on her when she made it upright. Rio turned her head to thank the person, who she assumed was Jen, but found her eyes meeting Agatha's. She stared uncomprehendingly. </p><p>"What?" Agatha asked. </p><p>"Rule 5," Rio said, confused. </p><p>Agatha dropped her hands like Rio had burned her. Alice seemed to ignore the interaction and merely ushered Rio to her room. Rio collapsed on the bed and was asleep within seconds. </p><p> </p><p>Rio became aware that there was someone in the bed with her before she was really aware that she was awake. </p><p>Once she was awake enough to see who it was, she rolled over, fully expecting Alice and was surprised to see that it was Agatha, perched against the headboard and scrolling on her phone. </p><p>"Oh," Rio said, her brain not fully online. </p><p>Agatha peered down at her. "How're you feeling?" she asked. Her tone was softer than Rio had heard in months. Over a year. Not since before their break-up. </p><p>Rio licked her lips. They were dry. "Good," she said, her voice cracking a little. "How was the rest of the party?" she asked, before realizing that the question broke Rule 4 and promptly shutting her mouth. </p><p>Agatha's eyebrow raised. "Wasn't much of a party, after what happened to you," she said. She reached over, as though to smooth Rio's hair out of her face. Rio jerked back, harsher than she intended, and Agatha's face pinched. Her hand dropped back into her lap. </p><p>Rio licked her lips again. "But you're ok and the baby is ok, right?" she asked. </p><p>"Yeah," Agatha said, her face slowly releasing the pinched look. "Rio, who possessed you?" </p><p>Rio scooched as far away as she could on the bed, putting space between herself and Agatha. "I think we shouldn't talk about this," she said. </p><p>"Why?" Agatha asked. The pinched look had returned to her face. </p><p>Rio shrugged as well as she could under the blankets. </p><p>"Why?" Agatha repeated. </p><p>Rio couldn't meet her eyes. "I just don't want to." Agatha had enough trauma from her mother before she learned that she had also tried to possess Rio. </p><p>"Right," Agatha said. She crawled out of the bed so quickly it left Rio blinking. She stood at the foot of the bed, her posture so awkward Rio felt her jaw drop. Agatha was never awkward. "Do you want me to bring you anything before I go?" </p><p>Rio let herself slide a little further into the bed. "Could you send Alice in? If she's awake?" </p><p>Agatha nodded mechanically and left the room. In a few minutes, Alice entered, dressed for bed.</p><p>"Hey," Rio said, as she struggled to sit up. </p><p>"Hey, hey," Alice said. "Lie back down. Don't worry about that." She clambered up onto the bed next to Rio. "I'm glad to see you up." </p><p>"What time is it?" Rio asked through a yawn. </p><p>"It's like 2 am, it's officially All Saints," Alice said. Rio had barely opened her mouth when Alice added, scowling, "Don't you even think about going anywhere. The entire point of this party was to avoid possession, you dumbass. What the fuck happened?" </p><p>Rio burrowed further into the covers. "You can't tell anyone," she said. </p><p>"Anyone?" Alice echoed. </p><p>Rio lowered her voice, not wanting to be overheard. "It was Agatha's cunt of a mom."  </p><p>Alice made a grossed out face. "She was trying to possess you?" </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. "She's pissed off about the baby." </p><p>Alice still looked disgusted. "Is it a race thing? I bet it's a race thing." </p><p>Rio shrugged. "I think in general she had a 'hating Agatha' thing. I only met her once and I barely managed to walk away without a felony. Thank the Mother she's dead." </p><p>"God," Alice hissed. She sat back firmly against the headboard. "Rio, that was fucking scary." </p><p>Rio shrugged. "It comes with the Green Witch territory." </p><p>"I know but..." Alice gnawed on her lip. "You almost didn't come tonight. What if you'd stayed at home?" </p><p>"I mean, it would have been awful," Rio said. "But I ultimately would have been fine." She looked directly into Alice's eyes, in hopes Alice would believe her. </p><p>Alice, it seemed, did not. "Next year," she declared, "you're coming here early and I'm making you your own personal protection circle and you will not move under any circumstances." </p><p>"Sure," Rio agreed readily. </p><p>Alice glared at her a little. "And I will remind you how easily you just agreed when you try to fight me on this next year." </p><p>Rio snorted. "Alright, Al," she said. "I take it you're not letting me go home now?" </p><p>"Absolutely not," Alice said. "We'll share the bed and all it's protection spells for the night. Let me get you some pajamas and set up some wards in the bathroom so that you can at least go brush your teeth." </p><p>"Thanks Alice," Rio said. "You're the best." She laid there, still, listening to Alice move around the room. Some pajamas were chucked at her head and Alice said, "I'll come back when the bathroom is ready for you." </p><p>"Thanks," Rio repeated. When Alice shut the door, Rio slid out of bed, mindful of the protection circle and began to change. </p><p>When the door opened, Rio's head was covered by the pajama shirt, so she called out "I'm changing Alice! Give me a moment!" </p><p>"It's not Alice," Agatha's voice responded. Rio quickly pulled the rest of the shirt over her head, her face flushing (though that was stupid. Agatha had seen her naked before). Agatha was framed in the doorway, her posture still uncharacteristically awkward. "I wanted to stop in and see if you needed anything, again, before I left," she said. </p><p>Rio shook her head. "I'm good," she said. "Alice has got me taken care of." </p><p>"Right," Agatha said, drawing out the word. "And you're staying here for the rest of the night?" </p><p>"Yeah, I'll share the bed with Alice. We've done it before." Rio paused. </p><p>"Ok," Agatha said. "Is there something you want to tell me? About you and Alice?" </p><p>"Like, what?" Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers against her arm. "Like you're dating?" </p><p>Rio's laughter at the suggestion surprised both her and Agatha. Alice, reentering from the bathroom, was startled by it. "Rio!" she exclaimed. "What's the joke?" </p><p>"Agatha wanted to know if the two of us are dating," Rio giggled (maybe she was a little hysterical, but sue her). "Is the bathroom ready for me?" </p><p>Alice waved in the direction of the bathroom. Rio walked the few feet down the hallway to wash her face, brush her teeth, and braid her hair so it wouldn't get so hopelessly tangled while she slept. When she emerged from the bathroom and headed back into Alice's room, it was clear that there had been some sort of heated exchange between the two. The air was staticy with overcharged magic and the two women were glaring at each other. </p><p>"What'd I miss?" Rio asked, warily. </p><p>Alice opened her mouth and Agatha put up her hand. "Don't," she said sharply. She turned on her heel and left the room, shoving past Rio as she went. Rio watched her walk down Alice's hallway in confusion. </p><p>"What were you two arguing about?" </p><p>Alice hesitated for a long moment, then finally said, "I don't like the way Agatha has been acting. Is all." </p><p>"Ok," Rio said. "What's she done this time?" </p><p>Alice sighed. "I don't like the way she's been treating you." </p><p>"Agatha has been treating me fine," Rio said. She gestured at the bed. "Am I good to get back in?" </p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Alice said, waving her on. </p><p>Rio slid back under the covers. "Is this about the rules? You were weird about them when I first showed them to you." </p><p>"Yeah," Alice said. "I don't like them." </p><p>"Why not? I think they made things pretty clear." </p><p>"Clarity isn't what I don't like about them, Rio. I just...I don't feel like they came from a good place." When Rio looked at her questioningly, Alice added, "It was clearly an attempt from Agatha to control you." </p><p>"Sure," Rio said. </p><p>"No, like," Alice was becoming flustered. "They weren't good rules. It was just Agatha trying to gatekeep herself and the baby from you." </p><p>"Ok," Rio said. When Alice seemed to get even more frustrated, Rio added, "You're not saying anything I don't already know, sorry." </p><p>That didn't seem to make Alice feel any better. "I wish you wouldn't follow them. I hate how Agatha has always said 'Jump' and you say 'How high?'"</p><p>Rio snuggled further into the bed. "That was a problem when we were dating, yeah. But I don't want to be that parent that's always getting into it with their ex. We need to get along for the kid. And if these are the boundaries that Agatha wants to set, then these are the boundaries that Agatha wants to set." </p><p>"I just knew from the first moment that I saw them that you would follow them to a T and Agatha would be breaking them left and right." </p><p>"Agatha hasn't--" Rio started to say. </p><p>Alice interrupted. "I literally watched her break them three times tonight." She rubbed her face. "Look, let's not argue about this. I know you're in a tight spot. I'm sorry that I inserted myself." </p><p>"You're fine," Rio said. "I know...being a friend to both of us also puts you in a tight spot." </p><p>"Yeah," Alice said. She slid under the covers and playfully knocked her shoulder against Rio's. "I am glad we're friends, though. I'm glad you and Agatha dated if I get to have you as a friend." </p><p>"I'm glad we're friends too," Rio said. She fell back asleep within seconds of Alice turning off the light. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio woke up because there was a cold draft of air moving through Alice's room. She cracked her eyes open to see a familiar skull face at the foot of the bed. That was enough to get her sitting straight up in bed, faster than if an electric shock had been run through the mattress </p><p>"Seriously?" she asked, before realizing that snapping at Lady Death was, perhaps, idiotic. </p><p>The Lady, though, did not seem offended. Though it was hard to tell, as the skull face stared at her, unblinking. </p><p>"Is it my time? Is it Alice's?" </p><p><em>Just wanted to check on you, </em>a voice echoed in her head. </p><p>Rio clutched the blankets a little closer to her chest. "Yes, I'm fine." </p><p>The skull face continued to stare at her. It was the first time Rio had truly felt unnerved in the presence of Lady Death, though she conceded that this was the first time the Lady was focused directly on her outside of a spirit realm. </p><p>
<em>You should talk to her. </em>
</p><p>Rio thought about playing dumb, but again. Probably not the best idea to fuck around with a cosmic entity. "Agatha?" </p><p>
<em>Yes. </em>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. "I don't think there's much to talk about. She's made her stance to me very clear." </p><p>"Who're you talking to?" Alice muttered sleepily next to Rio. </p><p>Rio turned towards her and when she looked back at the foot of the bed, Lady Death was gone. </p><p>"I gotta go," she whispered to Alice. Alice grunted, clearly only half awake. "I'll see you soon, ok?" </p><p>"K," Alice responded, smearing the words into her arm. "Be good." </p><p>"Always," Rio said. She mussed at Alice's hair a bit, receiving a groan in response, before clambering out of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio went straight home, where she took some time at her altar, lighting a candle and blooming a flower directly out of her hand to leave as an offering for Lady Death. She stared for a little while at the effigy she had set up. </p><p>"What do you want?" she muttered, even though Lady Death's speech had left no room for interpretation. </p><p>She scowled a little at the effigy. "I didn't know you were one to get involved in co-parenting relationships," she told the tiny painting. For a moment, she could swear she heard distant laughter. </p><p>Rio took a shower, then checked her work phone and email to see if there was anything from her patients to distract her. No messages awaited her, so  she pulled out her personal phone to see what was there. </p><p>
<em>Alice: I only sort of remember you leaving this morning. &lt;3 Text me and Jen immediately if you don't feel ok and we'll come over. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Jen: Let me know if you feel weird or dizzy at all. Stay hydrated. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Lilia: [a shaky picture of a tarot reading with more cards than Rio could honestly make heads or tails of] </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Would you be free to meet with me this week? </em>
</p><p>Overwhelmed, Rio blinked at the messages before carefully beginning to respond. </p><p>
<em>Rio: Jen, Alice, I feel fine, but I'll let you know if that changes. I have a giant bottle of water next to me. </em>
</p><p>A lie for now, but easily rectified. She filled up the bottle at the sink and brought it next to her. Jen had responded by the time she finished. </p><p>
<em>Jen: Glad you feel better. </em>
</p><p>Rio stared at Lilia's tarot card spread for several minutes before finally texting her a series of question marks. Then, after avoiding it as long as she could stand, she replied to Agatha. </p><p>
<em>Rio: Barring a patient emergency, I'm free most evenings this week. And I can rearrange my Wednesday night,  if needed. </em>
</p><p>She would have set her phone down out of anxiety of receiving a response, but Lilia had texted her back. </p><p>
<em>Lilia: Fruitfulness</em>
</p><p>Rio wasn't sure how to respond to that message, so just sent Lilia a thumbs up emoji. </p><p>
<em>Agatha: Would tonight be too short of a notice? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: If you're feeling up to it. I should have asked. Are you feeling ok? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Yeah, I feel fine. I'm taking it easy. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: I could do tonight. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Great. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: <u>Link to calendar invite</u></em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You remember where to park by my house? </em>
</p><p>Rio stared for a moment. Agatha's house? She hadn't stepped foot into it since she'd moved her stuff out. Her stomach flipped a little.</p><p>
<em>Rio: Yes, I remember. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Ok. Then I'll see you at six. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt anxious intermittently throughout the rest of the day (this is what a sapphic relationship with Agatha Harkness will do to you. You'll develop late in life anxiety). Victoria seemed to sense it, or maybe the spirit possession from the night before. When Rio walked into her bedroom, Victoria aggressively tapped her little legs against the glass of her tank, until Rio pulled her out. Then she ran up Rio's arm and nested into her hair. Rio couldn't help but giggle. "Hey, muchachita," she told her familiar. "Come to keep me company?"</p><p>Rio could feel her little legs tapping against her scalp as she tried her best to distract herself by playing <em>The Sim</em>s, but quickly had to stop when she found the household she'd made for the sims version of herself and Agatha while they were still together (at least the kid their sims selves had was a girl). Finally resigning herself to being unable to ignore her feelings, she puttered around her own apartment for a little longer before heading out to Agatha's. She slipped Victoria back into her tank, the tarantula fighting her every step of the way, but she calmed down when Rio blew her a kiss and told her "Te veo."</p><p>Rio still didn't know what Agatha wanted to talk about. Maybe the events of last night had made her reconsider something with custody, though Rio couldn't think of what (it wasn't like she was susceptible to spirit possession more than one night a year). Perhaps Agatha wanted to show Rio the nursery she'd set up for the baby or something else that was only in her home. </p><p>Rio knocked on Agatha's door at 6 pm sharp. When Agatha opened the door, she looked soft. Softer than Rio was used to her looking. Her hair was clipped out of her face the same way Rio liked to clip her own out of the way for work. Agatha was wearing a big hoodie than was huge on her, hanging down almost to her knees and the sleeves going past her hands. </p><p>"Most of my others don't fit," Agatha said, when she caught Rio staring. "Our child has blown me up like a balloon. Come in." She pushed the door open more. Rio hesitated a little and then entered. </p><p>"What do you want to talk about?" Rio asked. </p><p>"Can I get you anything?" Agatha asked. "Is there something I can do to make you comfortable?" </p><p>"Are you being nice to me so that you can avoid my question?" Rio countered. </p><p>"What? No." </p><p>"Because this being polite is not like you," Rio said, suspiciously. </p><p>"Contrary to popular belief, I don't think that pregnancy hormones can make you more bitchy if you're already a bitchy person," Agatha said. </p><p>"I didn't call you a bitch," Rio said. </p><p>"You implied it. So? Tea? Coffee?"</p><p>"Herbal tea, if you have it," Rio acquiesced. "No caffeine, please. And sorry. For the implication." </p><p>Agatha shrugged. "I'm not offended." She stepped away to peer into her cupboard. "You're in luck. Pregnant people aren't supposed to have caffeine, so I've amassed quite the collection. I've got raspberry, apple and cinnamon, orange...." </p><p>"Raspberry would be fine, thank you," Rio said. She watched silently as Agatha set the kettle on and prepped the mug for Rio. Once Agatha had deposited the mug in front of her, Rio tried to return to the topic at hand. "Ok, seriously. You're not acting like yourself." </p><p>Agatha smoothed down the front of her hoodie. For the first time, Rio could really see a bump there, even if it was caused by an excess of fabric and her heart pounded. That was her son in there. She felt a little light headed and tried to sip the (way too hot, ack!) tea to calm herself down. </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, closed it, and opened it again. "I never apologized," she said. </p><p>"You? Apologize?" Rio couldn't help but snort a little at that. </p><p>Agatha drummed her fingers against the table. If it was anyone else, Rio would have though that she was anxious. Agatha took a deep breath. "I should have never accused you of getting me pregnant on purpose," she said. "That was wrong of me. And I'm sorry." </p><p>"Oh," Rio said, more than a little shocked. "I'm--thank you." </p><p>Agatha nodded curtly. "You aren't the kind of person that would do that," she said. "Baby trap a person." </p><p>"No," Rio said. "I'm not." She tilted her head. "Wait, are you implying..."</p><p>"No!" Agatha practically yelped. "I didn't baby trap you either!" </p><p>Rio crossed her arms. "Cool, glad we were able to clear that up," she said. </p><p>Agatha swirled her hands. "And I just--I don't know if you were pissed at me or whatever. So, if you're upset with me for that, I just wanted to clear you up." </p><p>Rio sat her mug down hard enough it clattered. "What do you mean?" she asked. "I'm not mad at you." </p><p>Agatha reddened. "You are, obviously," she stated. </p><p>"Cite your evidence," Rio said. </p><p>Agatha ticked off on her fingers. "You don't talk to me at all. You'll respond to my texts if I text you, but you ignore me at all costs. When we do talk it's about the baby or like, my health." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said, confused. "That's Rule 4." </p><p>Agatha kept going. "Or you'll ask about money stuff. You got a lawyer already. That's insane, you know that right? Are you planning on some sort of drawn out custody battle?" </p><p>"No," Rio said. "That's Rule 1." </p><p>Agatha went on, full steam ahead. "You and Jen are getting along now. She hated you when we were dating and you hated her back. Now you guys are friendly! It's all just to spite me, isn't it?" </p><p>Rio's eyes narrowed. "Because Jen is your doctor. We have a working relationship now, not just 'Agatha's ex who Jen hates.'"</p><p>"Working relationship? You've been super buddy buddy with her the past couple of gatherings." </p><p>"I think we've reached a mutual understanding due to your pregnancy."</p><p>"Mutual understanding? You call last night a mutual understanding?" </p><p>Rio was beginning to develop a headache. "Jen is literally a doctor," she said, wincing a little. </p><p>"<em>And</em> last night you wouldn't let me touch you even though I was the one closest to you!" Agatha exclaimed. </p><p>Rio was about three seconds from flipping the table. "Because you told me not to!" she shouted, loud enough that Agatha sat all the way back into her chair. </p><p>Agatha looked fully taken aback and Rio tried to calm her breathing. "You gave me," she said, once she was able to speak clearly, "a little piece of paper that had five rules on it. And I have been following those rules this entire time. Why are you upset? You wrote them!" </p><p>Agatha began to open her mouth, but then Rio quickly amended, "Besides Rule 6. I know that I wrote that one." </p><p>Agatha's mouth opened and closed, then opened again. "The rules?" she said. </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. "I don't believe you. Did you forget that you wrote them?" </p><p>"No," Agatha said, cautiously. "I guess I just didn't think you'd follow them." </p><p>Rio stared at her. "You gave them to me. To follow." She put her head in her hands. "Here I thought that I was proving that I could be a good co-parent and you just thought I'd disregard them." </p><p>"That's not what I—" Agatha's words stuttered to a stop when Rio glared at her. </p><p>"So you wrote them to fuck with me? Or to make some sort of challenge so you could trip me up? That's really fucked up, Agatha, when I'm just trying to be as good of a parent as I can while the baby is still gestating." She shoved the mug away from her. "I'm done with this. Text me when you have an update about you or the baby." She stood up from the chair. "Bye Agatha." </p><p>"No no no!" Agatha exclaimed. "Rio, sit down. Please! Please don't leave!" </p><p>It wasn't like Agatha to beg. Rio slowly lowered herself back down into the chair. "Ok," she said. </p><p>Agatha ran her hand through her hair, mussing it further. "I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry." </p><p>"You already said sorry about the baby trapping comment." </p><p>"No, I'm sorry about everything," Agatha said. Her eyes were starting to tear up suspiciously. "I'm sorry about all of it." </p><p>"Ok," Rio said. "What is...all of it?" </p><p>Agatha looked away from her, towards the wall, for a long moment. When she looked back at Rio, tears that had gathered in her eyes had begun to roll down her face. Rio resisted the urge to reach out and brush them away. </p><p>"I'm sorry for the rules," Agatha started. "I wrote them when I was angry, I was so angry. I thought you'd used your powers to get me pregnant on purpose so that I would get back with you." Rio opened her mouth to protest, but Agatha held up her hand to stop her. "I know, Rio, ok? I know you wouldn't do it.  I was just so fucked up about it and I was so angry and I was still so upset about our break-up and...I'm not good with emotions."</p><p>"Yeah, I know," Rio said. "I did date you for a long time." </p><p>Agatha heaved a heavy sigh. "I have a hard time processing them. The emotions. And when I don't understand them, I lash out." </p><p>"Sure," Rio said. Agatha gave her a blank look, like she expected Rio to be having a strong emotion to her confession. Rio shrugged at her. "You're not saying anything I haven't already observed about you during the duration of our acquaintance."</p><p>"So then you see how the rules were written because of that." </p><p>Rio titled her head in thought. "No, there you lose me." </p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look. "Rio, I wrote you a list of specifically targeted rules because I convinced myself you were trying to punish me in some way and then I gave them to you. And then you followed them. Happily." </p><p>"They seemed fairly reasonable to me," Rio said. </p><p>Agatha gave her a look. "They were unhinged. I wrote them and I know that they were unhinged." </p><p>Rio gave a single shoulder shrug. "You just wanted to keep yourself safe. I get it." </p><p>"No, I--" Agatha exhaled sharply. "I wasn't being fair to you. I'm sorry." </p><p>Rio pulled the mug of tea back towards her. "Three apologies from you in a conversation? I think I've died and gone to the afterlife." </p><p>Agatha gave her a sharp look. "Don't joke about that," she snapped. </p><p>"Ok," Rio said, raising an eyebrow at Agatha's tone. "I won't." </p><p>Agatha lowered her eyes. "Last night was really scary, ok? It was like you were having the worst seizure in the world. You wouldn't respond to any of us. I thought you--" She broke it off. "I know whoever possessed you is dead, but I would kill them. Again. If I could." </p><p>"I'm sure," Rio said. </p><p>"Do you know who it was?" Agatha asked. Rio wasn't sure what expression her face was making, but she could tell it wasn't a neutral one from the way that Agatha's jaw dropped. "Son of a bitch! Was it my mom? Rio, did my fucking mom try to possess you?" </p><p>"She's pissed about the baby," was all that Rio could say. </p><p>Agatha snorted. "Of course she's fucking pissed, she's a raging racist." </p><p>"I think that was barely part of it," Rio said. "Like, she called me filthy and despicable but didn't break out any slurs I would have expected her to." Agatha still looked pissed off, so Rio continued, hoping that her explanation would remove the murderous look on her face. "She was mad that like...the baby chose us, I guess? I don't know." She lifted her mug again and began to fidget with it. "In the interests of honesty, she did tell me the gender."</p><p>"She what?" Agatha's mouth hung open. "How does she know? We don't even know." </p><p>Rio shrugged again. "I, uh, she was really mad. I mean, obviously. She was going on about how like h-the soul had been waiting centuries to be born and that you were chosen to be the mom. I got the vibe that she had wanted to be this particular soul's mom? Or at least wanted the soul to be born within her coven? So like. I guess our kid is going to be powerful or important or something. So. Congrats to us, I guess." </p><p>Agatha put her head in her hands, before looking back up at Rio. "I don't care about any of that," she said. "I don't know why she thinks I would." </p><p>"Because she's a cunt," Rio said, bluntly. "And she never took the time to get to know you and now, even in death, she fundamentally misunderstands you." </p><p>Agatha laughed hollowly. "Was she super excited to ruin the gender reveal?" </p><p>"No," Rio said, shaking her head. "It was just part of the rant. I mean, she's dead. How could she know that we hadn't learned the gender yet?" </p><p>"Sure," Agatha said. She tapped her fingers against the table and then heaved out a heavy sigh. "Ok, tell me the gender." </p><p>Rio shook her head. "You didn't want to know, I don't want to ruin this for you. I can act surprised whenever you decide to find out." </p><p>"Rio, you're going to slip and use a pronoun and then I'll know and I'll be pissed about it, so tell me, ok?" </p><p>"...It's a boy," Rio said quietly. </p><p>Agatha gasped. "A boy? I'm having--we're having--" Her face broke into a delighted smile. "A boy!" She reached over and grabbed Rio's hand. "Oh my God. We're going to be the most annoying boy moms ever. He's going to hate us." </p><p>Rio couldn't help but stare down at their linked hands. "Yeah," she said, a lump in her throat. "We will be the worst." </p><p>"I thought that he'd be a girl because of the, you know," she indicated between the two of them. "But a boy! Oh my God, what will we do with a boy?" </p><p>"Raise him to respect women and not be an asshole?" Rio said. </p><p>"Yeah, yeah. God, my mother <em>would </em>hate this, us having a boy. She would be mad that I didn't give birth to a girl to be another witch. This will be the best revenge. Maybe that's why she..." the delighted look fell off of Agatha's face. She abruptly pulled her hand back from Rio's. Rio's traitorous heart mourned the lost connection. </p><p>"Agatha?" she asked. Agatha had begun to rub her fingers together anxiously. Rio resisted the urge to grab her hand back and cease the anxious movement. </p><p>"He's a boy," Agatha said. "And he chose us." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. </p><p>"After centuries, right? That's what my mom said." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio repeated. </p><p>"Aw fuck," Agatha said. "Ok. I know why my mom is pissed." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, your son is going to be a very powerful warlock," Lilia said when they called. Agatha stared at the phone resting between her and Rio like it was a bomb about to go off. </p><p>"What do you mean, very powerful?" Rio asked. "Like. What are the parameters here?" </p><p>"Oh, nothing much to worry about, dears," Lilia said. "He's going to be able to manipulate the forces of magic." </p><p>"He's going to WHAT?" Agatha exclaimed. </p><p>Jen's aggrieved sigh in the background was loud enough that the phone picked it up. "I told you not to tell them," she said, her voice getting louder as she moved closer to the phone. "It was just going to freak them out."</p><p>"What does manipulate the forces of magic mean?" Rio asked. </p><p>"Teleportation, energy manipulation, dimensional travel..." Lilia started to say. </p><p>"Lilia!" They could hear as Jen wrestled the phone from her girlfriend. "Guys, seriously. Don't listen to her. It's just going to stress you out more and that's bad for all three of you." </p><p>"Oh God," Agatha said. "I knew it. My coven tried to summon him when I was little." </p><p>Rio looked over at her. Agatha's eyes were glued to the phone. "Is he like, a demon?" Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha laughed hollowly. "No, he's just...a very powerful soul that was supposed to be born many years ago. He would be a boon to any coven. I don't remember who discovered the records, but it was decided to summon him and see if he would be willing to have a coven member carry and birth him. God, I remember how mad my mother was when he told her no. She was angry for <em>days</em>." </p><p>"Did she want to be his mother?" Rio asked, her eyes still fixed on Agatha, completely ignoring the sound of Lilia and Jen bickering on the other side of the phone. </p><p>Agatha shrugged. "I think it was more of an open invitation, but. You know. I think she probably hoped that she would be the one chosen. I was a disappointment." </p><p>Before Rio could say something reassuring in response, Lilia's voice called from the other end of the phone. </p><p>"Tell Rio she needs to start learning woodworking! She's going to need the knowledge!" </p><p>"For what?" Rio asked, giving the phone a quizzical look. </p><p>Jen sighed loudly. "Her time jumping has been happening a lot more frequently ever since she found out that Agatha was pregnant. Seriously. Don't listen to her, she's been saying the weirdest crap and started painting a tarot deck for your kid." </p><p>"That's really sweet," Rio said. </p><p>"Babies can't read tarot," Jen said. "She has like ten years to make it. She doesn't need to destroy our office while making it <em>now.</em>" </p><p>Agatha gave a little snort of laughter, which seemed to help her out of her anxiety spiral. "Well, whatever keeps Lilia happy, I guess," she said. </p><p>Jen sighed again. "Happy wife, happy life or whatever the straights like to say." </p><p>There was a lull in the conversation and then Jen spoke up. "Seriously, don't stress about this part. Having a baby is a crazy enough experience as is. You don't need to be worried about his magic on top of that. I can assure you that based on what I can make of Lilia's visions, he does not destroy the world." </p><p>"Well, that's something, I guess," Rio muttered.</p><p>"You can't say that when you know I'm going to keep worrying," Agatha groused to Jen. </p><p>"Yeah, well, as your midwife, I'm telling you to stop," Jen said. "I'll write a prescription for it, even. Rio too. Don't test me." </p><p>Agatha flipped Jen the bird, even though they were not on Facetime and Jen could not see Agatha's middle finger. </p><p>"Agatha," Rio hissed. </p><p>"What's happening?" Jen asked. "Is she flipping me off over the phone?" </p><p>"Yeah," Rio confirmed. Agatha glared at her. </p><p>Jen laughed. "I hate you too, you loser." She made a loud <em>Mwah </em>sound and then hung up the phone. </p><p>Rio sat back in her chair. "I can't believe our fucking son babytrapped us,."</p><p>"What?" Agatha asked. </p><p>"You accused me of baby trapping you and then it turned out it was our son the entire time!" Rio shook her head. "That explains so much. That's why...." She scowled in the direction of Agatha's stomach. "We will be having words when you finally make your entrance into the world, young man, about consent and not messing with other people's magic." </p><p>Agatha rested a hand on her stomach. "Is that why it felt so weird?" she said. "When we hooked up?' </p><p>Rio cocked her head. "We never talked about it. Do you remember it happening?" </p><p>Agatha nodded. "Most of it, I think. The magic was...really overwhelming, I remember that. And I remember wanting you even more than usual. But the memories are hazy." </p><p>"Yeah, same," Rio said, before fully processing Agatha's words. What the fuck was <em>even more than usual </em>supposed to mean? She continued talking even though her brain was spinning. "Though, I remembered more yesterday, after the possession. Maybe the surge of magic unlocked the memories that had gotten hidden away." </p><p>"Can...souls do that?" Agatha asked. "Manipulate people in the land of the living? Outside of Halloween, even?" </p><p>Rio shrugged. "The afterlife really isn't my area of expertise. But why not? During the solstices and equinoxes, the veil is thin. Magic is stronger. That's why we're supposed to have protections during our celebrations." She thought about the list of powers Lilia had begun to share before Jen had cut her off. "Based on what Lilia shared...it sounds like our son is going to be formidable." </p><p>"Powerful and used to getting his own way," Agatha muttered. "To the point he engineered his own conception." </p><p>Rio picked up her mug to sip the now very cold tea. "It's those Harkness genes coming through." </p><p>Agatha glared at her, but there was a surprising lack of malice to it. </p><p> </p><p>Turned out, having to face to terrifying prospect of having to parent a powerful warlock with control over the forces of magic was a bonding experience. </p><p>Agatha threw the rules out, even though Rio had put up a bit of a protest against the change ("There's still some good points in there!"). Obviously, Jen would continue handling Agatha's medical care and they'd split everything 50/50 and eventually custody would have to be worked out, but other than that, the rules were gone. </p><p>Rio found herself on the receiving end of more text messages from Agatha. Most of the conversations were along the lines of what they had previously been discussing (<em>Target is having a sale on diapers and wipes. Here's a list of free baby boxes we can send away for. Hey have you gotten a crib? My coworker offered me one</em>), but they were friendlier now. Rio felt comfortable texting Agatha and asking her how her day had gone and letting the conversation continue past the initial text exchange of Agatha confirming or denying her day had gone well. Agatha started inviting Rio over to help with setting up the nursery, which then began to lead to Rio staying for dinner, then dinner and a movie.</p><p>"So, you've gotten back together, then?" Alice asked over a Saturday lunch date with Rio a few weeks later. "Please just confirm you have so that the rest of us can prepare ourselves emotionally." </p><p>"What?" Rio asked, shocked enough that her soup fell off her spoon. "Agatha and I are not getting back together." </p><p>Alice gave her A Look. "Right." </p><p>"Listen," Rio said, "Agatha isn't interested in me in that way anymore. I'm just happy we're at a point where we're not at each other's throats and we're actually getting along, properly, with no rules designed to keep us at arms length." </p><p>"You sure?" Alice said. "You're sure that Agatha isn't interested?" </p><p>"Why?" Rio asked. "Has she said anything?" Her voice went up practically another octave as she spoke and she had to clear her throat. </p><p>Alice lowered her head and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like <em>These two idiots I swear to the fucking Gods</em>.</p><p>"What?" Rio asked. "What did I do this time?" </p><p>"Be oblivious," Alice said. </p><p>"Oblivious?" </p><p>"You're making my point literally right now," Alice said, before changing the subject. Rio let her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha: What are you doing this weekend? I finally returned the awful rocking chair and got a new one. I'd appreciate your help with assembly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: I'm going to be busy for most of the weekend, but maybe I can come by on Sunday evening. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: What are you doing? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Just told my apartment complex that I'm not renewing my lease so now I get to spend my weekend looking at apartments. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: You're moving? </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Also I just realized I've never seen your new place. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: You're not missing much. It's barely big enough for me and Victoria as it is. No clue where I'd squeeze the baby in. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Want some company with looking? I'd like to see the potential places my kid might be staying at every other week. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio: Sure why not. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha: Cool. Send me the time, date, and address and I'll be there. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was like apartment shopping with Goldilocks. </p><p>Agatha's complaints were reasonable, at first. </p><p>"You're not going to want a sixth floor walk up with an infant. You'll throw out your back if you carry the stroller up all of those stairs!" </p><p>"The bedrooms here are so small. You'd only have space for all of the baby's things if you put him in the master and you sleep in the second bedroom. And that one is basically a glorified closet." </p><p>"There is a trash pile outside the kitchen window, can you imagine how bad the bugs and rats get? And the smell?" </p><p>And then the comments got...weird. </p><p>"The windows face south. You'll never get any light." </p><p>"There's not good place to put crystals next to running water in this apartment to energize them." </p><p>"Agatha you know I don't do crystals—" </p><p>"But if you started them you'd want a place to energize them with running water." </p><p>"The energy in the living room is foreboding. I feel my hackles raising." </p><p>"The paint job in this apartment is the worst landlord special I've ever seen." </p><p>And then the comments took a turn into the delightfully absurd. </p><p>"The realtor said that the apartment is Victorian, but the decorating is clearly Art Nouveau. Ridiculous." </p><p>"You'd need to set up your altar in this corner and I don't think Lady Death would like it. It would be like putting baby in the corner. Like from that movie." </p><p>"The elevator has mirrors in it which means people hook up in it all the time. Don't look at me like that, you know it's true."</p><p>By the end of the day, Rio was exhausted, they'd looked at ten apartments, and not a single one had met Agatha's approval. Rio even double checked to be sure. </p><p>"There wasn't a single one that you liked?" </p><p>"No," Agatha said, but her voice was the one she put on when she was scheming. "They were all horrible." </p><p>Rio sighed. "Well, I liked the second and third ones well enough. I'll put applications in there." </p><p>"Absolutely not," Agatha said. "I will not allow you to raise our child in those apartments! Who knows what sort of pests run through those walls!" </p><p>Rio was rapidly running through her patience. "Ok, then, Agatha. Where do you suggest I look to find an acceptable apartment?" </p><p>"Well, the Westview Apartment Complex has some wonderful apartments. Fairly affordable too!" </p><p>Rio blinked. "Agatha, that's your apartment complex." </p><p>"Oh so it is!" Agatha's mouth dropped open in a faux shocked expression. </p><p>"I suppose if there's an empty unit in there I can take a look at it," Rio conceded. "Do you know what the number is? I'll try to find the listing." </p><p>"It's number 94." </p><p>Rio had nearly typed the number into Zillow before it hit her. She looked up and stared at Agatha. </p><p>"Agatha, that's <em>your</em> apartment number." </p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her chest and gave a shocked gasp. "What? It is?" </p><p>"Agatha," Rio sighed. "What's your game here? Drop the act." </p><p>Agatha, to her credit, did. "I think you should move back in with me," she said, bluntly.</p><p>"Agatha, you have a two bedroom." </p><p>"Yes," Agatha agreed. "I'm glad that you can count." </p><p>"And you're already turning the second bedroom into the baby's bedroom."</p><p>"As you should know, since you've been helping me set it up."</p><p>"So, where would I go? Would I be sleeping on the couch? You literally just expressed concern about my back earlier—" </p><p>"I think we should get back together," Agatha said. </p><p>Rio blinked. She had misheard or was hallucinating or maybe she was in a coma after her confrontation with Agatha's mom. "What?" </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. "You heard me. I think we should get back together." </p><p>"Pranks are only funny if the person you are pulling the prank on is also laughing," Rio said.</p><p>Agatha's face fell to a hurt expression. "It's not a prank. I think we should get back together. For real." </p><p>"I need to sit down," Rio said, as she felt the feeling disappear from her knees. There was a bench about ten feet away. Rio somehow got to it and sank down onto it, not minding how the cold metal stung her skin through the denim of her jeans. Agatha followed her and sat down next to Rio without asking for permission. Their legs briefly brushed together and Rio scooched over so there was more space between them. The extra sensory input was not needed or wanted right now. She didn't look at Agatha to see if her expression was hurt. </p><p>"Alice told me she thought you were interested in me again and I didn't believe her," Rio said. </p><p>"Well, you should have listened to her." </p><p>There was a long moment of silence between them, filled only with the sound of passing cars. It was only when Agatha began to shiver that Rio finally brought herself to speak. </p><p>"What brought this on?" she asked. Then she added, "Should we keep moving or? I don't want you to get cold." </p><p>"I'd like if we moved, thanks," Agatha said. They rose and started slowly walking down the street. "I think there's a coffee shop down this way. But, oh, you asked me what brought this on?" </p><p>"Yes," Rio said. "Agatha. Our break-up was horrible." </p><p>Agatha hummed. "It was," she said, quietly. </p><p>"I don't....I can't go through that again," Rio said, the ache in her chest returning like the break-up had happened a day ago and not nearly a year and a half before. "It was. It was bad, Agatha." </p><p>Agatha shoved her hands deeper into her pockets and took a deep breath. "I'm in therapy." </p><p>The news was so shocking that Rio screeched to a halt in the middle of the street. "Therapy?" </p><p>Agatha nodded. </p><p>Rio licked her lips. "Agatha...I begged you..." </p><p>"I know," Agatha said quietly. Shame flickered across her face. "I know and...I'm sorry." </p><p><em>Another </em>apology from Agatha Harkness. Rio really should go buy a lottery ticket or 20. "What finally happened?" Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha looked away. She started shivering again and Rio, without thinking, grabbed her arm so they could walk a little quicker up the street to the coffee shop. </p><p>"I started looking for a therapist after our first meeting, where we went over the rules," Agatha said. "Because I...well." She stopped speaking, her teeth gnawing on her lip. </p><p>"Well?" Rio prompted. </p><p>Agatha halted in the middle of the street. At this rate they were never going to make it to the coffee shop. She was shivering even more and Rio pressed closer to her, trying to warm her. </p><p>"Agatha," Rio said, changing gears. "You don't have to tell me now. Let's just get to the coffee shop and we'll get warmed up and then, if you feel up to it, we can talk about it." </p><p>Agatha didn't respond, so Rio tugged her along as carefully as possible. Agatha stumbled a little, then said, like it was torn out of her, "I'm so worried about being my mother." </p><p>Rio turned towards her as much as she could, while still moving them in the direction of the coffee shop. She couldn't look at Agatha head on, but she thought she could see tears gathering in the corners of her eyes. </p><p>"Agatha, no. No, you would never." </p><p>"But I treated you horribly," Agatha croaked out, the tears falling free down her face. If it was a few degrees cooler, they would have frozen, but instead they slid down her cheeks unrestrained. "I was horrible to you. I said awful, awful things. Things that I knew would hurt you." </p><p>"I pushed you," Rio said, in response. "I pushed you past your limits. I know I did that. I should've....there were times that I needed to give you space, you know. I can see that in hindsight." </p><p>Agatha shook her head. "You did that because you loved me and you wanted me to be better. I just wanted to hurt you. And that's what my mother did to me. She wanted me to hurt, like she hurt. And I thought," the tears were welling up again. Rio found herself making shushing, cooing noises. She slowed down their pace and rummaged in her pocket to pull out a handkerchief. When she wiped off Agatha's face, Agatha let her, though she was clearly trying to suppress her sobs. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she said. </p><p>"Shhh, sweetheart," Rio said, the pet name tripping off her tongue without her realizing. "Shhh, it's ok. You're ok." </p><p>"I just didn't want to do that to him," Agatha sobbed out. "To our son. I couldn't live with myself." </p><p>"Agatha, you would never," Rio said. "You're going to be a good mom. You're not your mother." </p><p>"But I can be like her," Agatha persisted. "I was like her when I hurt you. And I don't want that to happen. I can't let that happen. So, I found the therapist. And I saw her twice a week for awhile. Now it's only once a week." </p><p>"Oh, that's good," Rio said. "It means you got a good grade in therapy, so to speak." </p><p>Agatha gave a little watery chuckle.</p><p>"Come on," Rio said, tugging on her arm. "I want to continue this conversation, but you're clearly freezing. Let's get you inside. I don't want you to turn into a popsicle." </p><p>Agatha nodded, clearly still unable to speak clearly and they hurried the rest of the way to the coffee shop. When they got inside, Rio got Agatha tucked into a little corner booth with poor visibility, so that it was harder for someone to look in on Agatha crying, and went up to order their drinks. </p><p>When Rio returned, Agatha had composed herself and the tears that had streaked her face were gone. She accepted the cup Rio handed her with a quiet "Thank you." Rio slid into the booth across from her and watched as Agatha fidgeted with the lid of the cup. </p><p>"So, your therapy is going well?" Rio finally prompted. "Unless, you don't want to talk about it now." </p><p>"Yes, it's going well," Agatha said. She continued to play with the lid of the cup. "I mean, I already said a lot of what I needed to say outside. But." She shrugged a little. "It started out as me not wanting to be like my mom and then unpacking all of the things that I do to keep people at arm's length and how I am hurting not only them, but also myself with that and. Yeah. I treated you badly because of my own issues and that wasn't fair to you." She took a deep breath. "And I understand if, especially with the way our relationship ended, you don't want to get back together. But I miss you. I miss you a lot, Rio." </p><p>"I'm sitting right here," Rio said, a little stupidly. </p><p>The corners of Agatha's mouth twitched up. "You sitting here with me just isn't enough. I miss everything. All the little things. Sharing space with you, sleeping next to you, coming home after work and talking about my day with you. All of it." </p><p>Rio's mouth twitched. "And here I thought the one thing I brought to the table was the sex." </p><p>"I do also miss the sex," Agatha said. "But I figured that shouldn't be brought up first thing when I'm talking about how much I miss you." </p><p>Rio felt a sob escape her lips. </p><p>Agatha sobered. "I can't promise that it'll be completely different," she said. "But I will try. I can promise you that I'll keep trying. That I'll do my best to communicate with you, even when it's hard for me. I just might need a little more time to process, is all. I've been getting a lot less angry and wanting to lash out at others, since I started working on it in therapy." She shifted, her hands coming to rest on her stomach. "But also, you said you can't go through our break-up again. And I understand that. And you know. There's our son to think about." </p><p>"Yeah," Rio said. "Divorces always sucked for the kids that I knew growing up." </p><p>Agatha sucked a breath in. "Yes, yeah." She ducked her head. "It sounds like you're not willing to try again and I do understand." </p><p>Rio tapped her fingers lightly against the table. She felt as though there was a fork in the road before her, two paths to choose from. She nearly checked her phone to see if Lilia had texted her a photo of a tarot card pull. </p><p>On one hand, she and Agatha had been working hard on the co-parenting relationship, both with and without the rules. It was starting to solidify into a steady thing, something that could be relied on to support their son. It seemed like a bad idea, so close to his birth, to throw a wrench into it. On the other hand, Rio missed Agatha. Had missed her, for the year and a half they'd been apart, even when Rio tried to remind herself of all of the rough edges of Agatha that made dating her difficult. The allure of dating Agatha again, especially this version of Agatha that was working on herself and had finally gone to therapy, was very tempting. </p><p>Agatha, to her credit, sat there silently, letting Rio think. She sipped at the tea in her cup and waited until Rio's brain settled on a conclusion. </p><p>"My lease is up right around your due date," Rio said. </p><p>"Ok." </p><p>"So. I'm not going to move in with you now." </p><p>Agatha nodded. "Ok," she repeated. </p><p>"But," Rio gnawed on her lip. "We can try dating again. And see how it goes. If we have problems being in a relationship, we need to cease it immediately. I can't...we need to get along for our son." </p><p>Agatha nodded. "He's the priority." </p><p>"And we should probably do couples counseling. On top of the therapy we both already are doing. I think that would be smart. But yeah. Yeah. We can try to be in a relationship again." </p><p>"Ok," Agatha said. "Come over here so I can kiss you." </p><p>"Why do I need to come to you?" Rio asked, already moving. </p><p>"Because I'm carrying your first born son and heir," Agatha said and Rio promptly ruined their kiss by snort laughing. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rio: Agatha and I are back together. </em>

</p><p>
<em>Rio: We did already? </em>
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<em>Agatha: I do. </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nicholas was born on March 20th, in the midst of the Spring Equinox. The perfect birthday for a baby boy who brought with him joy, blessings, and new light. He was ten pounds even and Agatha shrieked when Jen announced his weight. "Rio, that has to be your fault! I was a tiny baby." </p><p>Rio had laughed deliriously. Nicholas was placed on Agatha's chest, where she openly sobbed and babbled to him slightly nonsensically. "Nicholas Nicholas Nicholas. Look at him, Rio. We made him from scratch. Nicholas Scratch. Our little Nicky." Rio was only vaguely surprised when she found herself writing "Nicholas Scratch Harkness-Vidal" on his birth certificate. </p><p>She looked at her son in his bassinet and squinted at him. "This is the middle name you want, huh? It was definitely not on the list your Mama and I made." </p><p>Nicky yawned. Rio decided that if somehow dictating his own middle name was the only evidence of his powers at this point, she'd take it. </p><p>Not that she cared about his foretold powers. Mostly she stared at his squishly little face, which Agatha swore up and down was a copy of Rio's own. </p><p>"You carry a baby for nine months and then he ends up looking like his fucking dad!" Agatha had whined, but she hadn't seemed angry. Rather, she had seemed perfectly delighted with him.</p><p>"I think he has your chin," Rio had argued. </p><p>"Yeah, no," Agatha said. "That's definitely yours, my love." </p><p>They'd stayed overnight in the hospital and Rio had blinked awake at one point in the middle of the night. At first she wasn't sure what had awoken her. The room was silent, nether Agatha or Nicky making any noise. Then Rio's eyes focused on Lady Death standing over Nicky's bassinet, a smile gracing her bony visage. Rio didn't even have the chance to call out or greet her or even ask what was happening before the Lady was gone. Rio had rushed to his bassinet to see that he was sleeping, little chest rising and falling with his breaths. </p><p>When Agatha had awoken and Rio had explained what she had seen, Agatha seemed bothered. </p><p>"It's not...his time, right?" she asked, adjusting the little hat on she'd placed on Nicky's head. </p><p>"No," Rio said. "It's not. It won't be his time for a long time."</p><p>Agatha adjusted the hat again, though the change was barely visible. "Well, maybe his great destiny is to be her assistant or something. She's checking in on her future employee's development." </p><p>"Weird thing to do when he's like, twelve hours old," Rio pointed out. </p><p>"Well, I don't know, Rio. You know her best."</p><p>Rio shrugged. "As well as one could know Lady Death." </p><p>Agatha snorted. "You say that like she hasn't clearly chosen you as her favorite." </p><p>Rio decided not to deign that with an answer. She looked over at Nicky, who was blinking up at them both with his big brown eyes. Rio knew their faces were too far away for his eyes to be able to focus in on her or Agatha, but it was a nice thought that he was staring up at them anyway. </p><p>It was still a little weird to come home to Agatha's apartment. Rio had only moved in a month prior and there was still that moment of Rio re-realizing every time she walked through the door that this was where she lived, now that she and Agatha were back together. </p><p>"Home sweet home," Agatha said, making her way to the couch and immediately making grabby hands for Nicky. Rio carefully passed him over. </p><p>"Do you want the nursing pillow to help support him?" she asked Agatha. </p><p>"That would be nice," Agatha said and Rio went into the nursery to fetch it. "What time is it now?" Agatha called after her. </p><p>"It's noon," Rio called back. She returned and passed the pillow to Agatha, who slid it under Nicky's body. "The coven should be over around three, but if we need more time I can text them and get them to delay their arrival." </p><p>"No, it's fine," Agatha said, though she was clearly distracted with staring at Nicky's face. She stroked her finger over his cheek. </p><p>"I suppose it is a little unfair that Jen has gotten to see him and Alice and Lilia have had to wait," Rio said. </p><p>"Mm," Agatha hummed. </p><p>Rio settled onto the couch next to her and rested her head against Agatha's shoulder. Agatha leaned her head against the top of Rio's and they sat there with Nicky until all of their breathing synced. Rio only rose up when it got close to 3 pm so that she could unlock their front door. </p><p>The coven traipsed in quietly, bringing with them gifts and blessings. Nicholas was passed around to each member (though Lilia and Alice did their best to claim priority, as Agatha and Rio had had the whole night with him already and Jen had had the honor of being the first to hold him). </p><p>"He's so cute," Alice commented, as she held him in her arms. Nicky was staring up at her with his big brown eyes. "Insane to think that he's supposed to end up being the most powerful of all of us." </p><p>Nicky gave a sweet little coo. </p><p>Alice laughed. "Look at him. The picture of innocence." </p><p>Nicky cooed again. </p><p>"Oh, you're going to be <em>trouble</em>," Lilia said in a sing-song voice. </p><p>"You would know," Jen said. </p><p>"Any insight you can give us?" </p><p>Lilia shook her head a little. "Just give him love and support. That's what he'll need." She paused. "And the woodworking. Have you started, Rio? It's very important." </p><p>"With what time?" Rio asked. "I was moving!" </p><p>Jen laid her hand on Lilia's shoulder and shushed her. "Don't rush Rio," she scolded. "We got her the voucher for classes for Yule, she'll use it when she's ready." </p><p>"Thank you Jen," Rio said, flashing her a smile, which Jen returned. </p><p>The coven left after a little longer, Nicky getting fussy and Alice having triple checked the protection spells she had previously placed around the apartment. Agatha fed Nicky and then Rio took him to change his diaper. </p><p>"You did very well meeting everyone," she said. "I feel like you're going to be much better at this social thing than I am." </p><p>Nicky fussed and whined a bit as she changed his diaper but didn't full out scream or sob. Rio shushed him as she put on the fresh diaper. "I know you're tired, I know." </p><p>She carried Nicky into the master bedroom, which she was back to sharing with Agatha. Half of her boxes were still unpacked, what with her move being so close to Nicky's due date. The tank for Victoria had been set up, of course, and she could see the tarantula watching Nicky with interest as Rio passed by with him. </p><p>"I wonder what familiar you will have," Rio said to Nicky. "I have a tarantula and your Mama has a rabbit. There's not an animal that is a good mix of those two." Scratchy, sensing he was being spoken about, hopped out from under the bed and headed to rest under Victoria's tank. </p><p>Agatha entered from the bathroom, her face washed and hair braided, rubbing her eyes. "He'll have something terrifying and rare, I'm sure," she said. "Just like his magic." </p><p>Rio placed Nicky on his back in the bassinet, holding her breath. He didn't cry or complain, just lay there, blinking. Agatha exhaled. "Good, good. He'll sleep for about three hours and then he'll be awake for food and maybe a change." </p><p>"I can get up with him," Rio offered. </p><p>"No, I—"</p><p>"My love, you need to sleep." Rio steered Agatha towards the bed. "You sleep as much as you can, I can do the night duty tonight." </p><p>Agatha's answering yawn was too large for her to argue back and when it was done, she glared at Rio. Rio chuckled and pecked her on the lips. "Rest now. There will be many more nights in the future to share in night duty." </p><p>"Mm," Agatha agreed, sleepily. She was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Rio stroked her hair, gazing over at their sleeping son. Or so she thought. He opened his eyes and stared at her, his eyes way too knowing for an infant less than 48 hours old. </p><p>Rio didn't flinch and merely went over to his bassinet. "Sleep, papito," she murmured. "It's the rule." </p><p>Nicky cooed a little and closed his eyes again. Rio fell asleep to the sound of Agatha and Nicky's matching soft snores and the magic from all three of them swirling slowly and soothingly around the room. </p>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Minor blood: When Rio comes to post possession, she has a nosebleed. She mentions feeling/tasting the blood on her face.</p><p>Mild ableism: Jen mentions finding Rio "weird and off putting" as part of a conversation where the two are coming to an understanding</p><p>Gendered insults: Multiple characters call Evanora a bitch and a cunt.</p><p>Racism: Rio repeats Evanora's insults directed towards herself. Multiple characters refer to Evanora as racist but nothing more serious than the last chapter is discussed.</p><p>Childbirth: Time skip to the end of Agatha's childbirth to once Nicky is born but there's mentions of being in the hospital and some post birth going ons. There are no childbirth complications for Agatha.</p><p>Mildly dubious consent: It's revealed that a third party (not Agatha or Rio) used their magic to cause/influence their summer solstice hook up. Neither Agatha nor Rio feel particularly upset/hurt/traumatized by the reveal.</p><p> </p><p>Guys I am genuinely so blown away with the response to this fic. I really hope the ending lived up to all of your expectations. &lt;3 Thank you for taking the time to read and comment and kudos, I really appreciate.</p><p>Please know that my friend Shannen, while betaing the fic, kept predicting the next events of the story and I had to keep being "I think you should keep reading the fic, Shannen" (though they had NO INKLING of the Lady Death backstory I shared hehehe).</p><p>You're not going to believe this, but you're able to find me on tumblr at <a href="https://paperairplanesopenwindows.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">paperairplanesopenwindows.</a></p></blockquote>
