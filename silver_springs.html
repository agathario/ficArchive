     The Meet Cute

<!--chapter content-->

<p>
     Rio Vidal rushed desperately into the first coffee shop she could find. It was one of those fancy ones that catered for the executive crowd, filled with people in suits,talking obnoxiously loud on their cell phones.
    </p>
<p>
     She ran over to the counter. “Hey, can I use the bathroom?”
    </p>
<p>
     The barista looked her up and down. “It’s for paying customers.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hated her instantly. “Then I’ll buy something.” She grabbed a bagged loaf of bread on the counter. “Here, I’ll take this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a line.” The barista nodded to Rio’s left and to her dismay, there were near a dozen people already waiting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, I really…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, hey hun.” a strong voice cut her off, and Rio looked to see the next person in line walk towards them. The woman was tall with long brown hair, piercing blue eyes, and a jaw that Rio was already obsessed with. The killer suit and confident smile also didn’t help her mind totally short-circuiting.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was wondering where you had gotten to,” the woman continued. “I was worried you’d got lost.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned at the woman, who simply stared her down expectantly. If she wasn’t totally distracted by the goddess before her, she probably would have gotten the hint quicker, but she got it in the end.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry sweetheart. I got held up at work.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” the woman assured. “Good choice on the bread. Grilled cheese for dinner?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “With that fancy cheese we got from the deli? Sounds amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It does.” A gleam of amusement appeared in the woman’s eyes, before she stared down the barista with a cool gaze. “My wife asked for the bathroom key.”
    </p>
<p>
     While the woman’s words sent a not unpleasant shockwave through Rio’s body, they startled the barista into action. She reluctantly held out the bathroom key, and Rio snatched it away with a spiteful smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be right back, babe,” she told the woman, who reached out and took the bread from her, their fingers just avoiding touching.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure hun, do you want your usual?”
    </p>
<p>
     “An iced coffee, yes,” Rio confirmed. “But I can get it when I get out…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember, what’s mine is yours,” the woman answered with a wink, and Rio had to bite her cheek to not giggle like a lovestruck girl. “I’ll wait for you out here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks sweetheart.” Rio shot one last glare at the barista before finally, FINALLY, making her way to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     In there, she thought over what had just happened. The most gorgeous woman she had ever seen just pretended to be her wife! Maybe her stepsister was right and she had officially gone crazy, because there’s no way that had just happened to her.
    </p>
<p>
     She got out her phone and decided to text said stepsister.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay either I’ve gone totally crazy after all or the world has decided I’m blessed today.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ???
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Long story but the sexiest woman on the planet just pretended to be my wife so I could get a bathroom key.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wait what?! I need more details!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      No time! I’m in the bathroom and she’s bought me coffee! What should I do?!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      GET OUT THERE AND TALK TO HER YOU IDIOT!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raced to freshen up before all but tumbling out of the bathroom door. Luckily, she recovered herself and strode confidently through the coffee shop. The woman was stood to one side, the bread under her arm and the drinks in her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled when she saw Rio walking over. “All good?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio tossed the bathroom key on the counter, and it hit the surface with a clatter. The barista (and several others) flinched, and she saw her fake wife bite back a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio accepted the iced coffee held out to her. “Thanks, how much do I owe you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry about it.” The woman held out the bread with a smile. “I’m Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.” The name rolled off Agatha’s tongue in a way Rio had never heard before. “Nice to meet you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Trying hard not to blush, she took a sip of her coffee. “Well, thank you for the help, and the coffee, and the bread.”
    </p>
<p>
     “In all honesty, I needed entertaining, and there is nothing better than making someone squirm.” Agatha looked over at the barista and pursed her lips. “Especially someone who has messed up my coffee order one to many times.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “We really did make her squirm, didn’t we?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips curled into a devious grin. “We make quite the pair of antagonists.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head. “You busy right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for her phone. “Well I can…not be busy, why do you ask?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you feel about finishing our coffees together. Somewhere other than here.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Agatha tap away at her phone and wondered if she had been too bold with her proposition. It wouldn’t be the first time; Alice always said she came on too strong.
    </p>
<p>
     When she stopped typing, Agatha pocketed her phone again and nodded towards the door. “Ladies first.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness wasn’t sure why she’d done it.
    </p>
<p>
     Since her assistant Ralph had quit, she found herself having to get her own drinks from the coffee shop around the corner of the office. Usually, she didn’t like being around so many people, all irritating in their own way. That visit, she been too preoccupied reading an email from one of her clients asking for his novel’s release date to be brought forward. She was just drafting a response email when she heard a commotion ahead of her. Over the bathroom key of all things.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Great
     </em>
     , she thought,
     <em>
      just what I need right now.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She only meant to steal a glance at the scene out of pure nosiness. Yet the moment she saw the woman arguing with the barista, she couldn’t look away. The face, the hair, the big brown eyes…Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off her.
    </p>
<p>
     She listened to the back and forth between the mystery woman and the bitchy barista, and the next thing she knew, they were married and having grilled cheese for dinner. Crazy? Even crazier was buying said woman bread and iced coffee, waiting for her to use the bathroom, and had cancelled the rest of her schedule for the day to wander through a nearby park with said woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do you do for work?” Rio asked. “I’m guessing you’re a boss or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or something,” Agatha confirmed. “I work for major publishing house. I’m in charge of making sure everyone is doing their job properly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you’re the boss?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but he’s scared of me so I might as well be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Well, I’m certain you look better in a power suit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled while subtly looking over Rio’s attire. She had a blazer on, and a white button up blouse and black trousers that, well, hugged. Her hair was up, and her make-up was neat. Anyone would think she fit into the corporate world. Yet the shoes gave her away.
    </p>
<p>
     Converse sneakers were not business attire.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve just started my PhD, so that takes up most of my time. I help out my sister too. It’s complicated but her mom’s estate is hard to manage alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was certainly intrigued. “What are you studying?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed awkwardly and bowed her head. “Erm…botany.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to cool her reaction, but her eyebrows had a mind of their own. “So…flowers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean I guess yes. My speciality is poisonous plants. I was actually meeting with a company to see if they’d finance a study I’m working on, but I guess we’ll see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, she was back on board. “That actually sounds interesting. So you’ve, like, handled all these plants?”
    </p>
<p>
     “With the correct safety procedures, yes. I also dabble in the study of arachnids, but that’s just a hobby. I have a tarantula.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A tarantula? Is that your idea of cute and cuddly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio answered without hesitation. “Have you ever held a tarantula? They’re actually very gentle.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take your word for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped her empty cup in a trash can as they walked by. “Okay then, what is your idea of cute and cuddly?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Something that doesn’t have six legs,” Agatha sassed, but when Rio stared her down, she sighed. “Fine, I like rabbits.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “Rabbits?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. She couldn’t believe she was admitting this to a complete stranger. “Yes, I actually just got a baby bunny…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped in her tracks. “Woah, woah, woah. You have a
     <em>
      baby
     </em>
     rabbit?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I see it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A photo or in person?” Agatha cursed herself. Why the hell did she ask that?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “In person is an option?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Agatha answered casually. “Unless you have other plans?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope, you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got out her phone again and texted her sister.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Can’t make it tonight. Something came up.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In true Rebecca style, she replied straight away.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      REBECCA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Work??
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced up at Rio, who was watching her closely, before responding.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      No, something else.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha indeed had a bunny, and Rio was in love. He had mostly white fur, with little beige patches and random black speckles, and the most precious little face. While she was not one to subscribe to conventional ‘cuteness’, he was certainly an exception.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s his name?” Rio asked from her stop on the floor, sat crossed legged with the rabbit cradled in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Senõr Scratchy,” Agatha answered from where she stood at the kitchen counter, making them some tea. “My nephew named him. He was originally his, but it turns out his dad is allergic to rabbits.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How old is your nephew?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s 14. He’s…well, he’s going through a lot. My sister and brother-in-law got him the rabbit to help, but then when his dad came out in hives…”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you took the rabbit instead?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you’re secretly happy about it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Though Agatha had her back to her, Rio could tell she was smiling. “It didn’t take much persuading.”
    </p>
<p>
     Other than the rabbit, Agatha’s living area consisted of a set of leather couches, an antique looking coffee table, rows and rows of bookshelves taking up the walls without kitchen fixtures and large windows that looked out over the city. It was an expensive place, Rio knew from the location, but it felt as homely as Alice’s box apartment in a pre-war building (where she was currently staying on the couch).
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha was done with the drinks, she carried it over and placed one on the coffee table, before settling at the far end of the sofa with her own. Rio instantly noticed the designs didn’t match: the white one Agatha was holding had ‘COOL AUNT CLUB’ printed on it in big purple writing, while hers was black with ‘WITCHES BREW’ written in white lettering.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to get a crazy rabbit lady mug,” Rio commented. “Alice got me a crazy plant lady one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused for a moment. “Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My step-sister,” Rio clarified, before smirking. “Was that a hint of jealousy I heard there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” Agatha frowned at her coffee like a sulking child. Rio’s smirk grew. She was definitely jealous.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m very much single.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her with a disbelieving look. “So there’s no one...?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Alice likes to set me up on blind dates, but I’m not a people person. I’m guessing you have plenty of admirers, though?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Jen says I scare everyone I meet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio set Senõr Scatchy down and  climbed onto the couch. She reached for her coffee and took a sip. “Jen, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     When she saw the other woman smirk, she knew she’d failed at playing cool.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now who’s jealous?"
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I was?” Rio quickly turned the tables.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’d say she’s my friend, and I’d be disappointed if you weren’t jealous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at her answer. “Glad to know we’re on the right page.”
    </p>
<p>
     They continued chatting about this and that: Rio gave Agatha a crash course in poisonous plants to watch out for, and Agatha told Rio about her love for literature, which she got from her grandmother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I lived with her for a while,” Agatha admitted. “My mother didn’t want me in her house but wouldn’t let me go to my dad’s more than the court allowed it, so I ended up there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you live there long?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The whole last year of middle school until the end of spring break freshman year. My dad got a good lawyer, and my grandmother was getting too old to give me the support I needed. It meant I got to live with my half-sister too, which gave us time to get under each other’s feet enough to form a sisterly bond.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Alice and I had plenty of time for that too. What happened to your grandmother?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She died not long after I finished college.” Agatha reached into shirt, revealing a chain with an old locket with a cameo image of three figures against a deep purple. “This was hers. A family heirloom. I know it’s not the fanciest of jewellery, but it was hers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like it,” Rio insisted. “It’s classic, and unique.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and tucked it back in her shirt. She looked out of the window and frowned. “Huh.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio followed her gaze and saw the sun had started to dip behind the buildings. “Wow, I didn’t realise it was this late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you have to be anywhere?” Agatha asked. “I mean, it’s fine if you do, but if not do you want to go get dinner? Or I can get us some take out?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I have that bread.” Rio nodded to the loaf that had been abandoned on the breakfast bar. “If you have cheese, we can have that grilled cheese dinner we talked about earlier.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anything for my darling wife,” Agatha teased, before getting up to gather what they needed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio used the opportunity to text Alice.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Having dinner with my coffee wife. Don’t wait up.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Weirdo but also tell me everything tomorrow.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sent her a wink face before following Agatha. Something she hoped would be a new habit.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They ate the grilled cheeses over the sink as they turned out to be messier than they anticipated, and between their laugher, Agatha found out Rio had never seen
     <em>
      The Conjuring
     </em>
     , so a movie night quickly followed.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio cackled at yet another jump scare, Agatha couldn’t help but laugh with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “How are you both wonderful and the strangest person I’ve ever met?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Strange is my superpower,” Rio answered. “And I saw you laughing too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine, I’m strange too I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted to rest her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “That’s why we get on so well.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha agreed. “Maybe.”
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the movie ended, Rio was pretty much in her lap, and when the credits rolled, she shifted until she was pretty much straddling Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed. “It’s late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Agatha agreed. “What shall we do about that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I could stay?” Rio suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     “You could,” Agatha agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     “But no sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked. “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want a one-night stand,” Rio clarified, and Agatha smiled in relief.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, yes, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But we could kiss, and cuddle, and maybe let our hands wander.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “That sounds like a reasonable plan to me. I’ll get you something to sleep in…”
    </p>
<p>
     She went to get up, but Rio pushed her back down. The next thing, Rio was straddling her properly, their faces so close, Agatha could feel her breath against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She waited for the kiss, waited for the floodgates to open, but it never came. Rio slid off her lap and walked towards the bedroom. “Come on then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t need telling twice.
    </p>
<p>
     She found Rio a baggy shirt and got her a toothbrush and towels to freshen up in the en-suite. Agatha changed into her own shorts and an old Carhartt shirt. Sitting on the end of the bed, she waited for Rio to emerge.
    </p>
<p>
     When the bathroom door opened, Rio stepped out in a Fleetwood Mac t shirt that sat at the top of her thighs. She placed her folded clothes on the chair in the corner of the room, and Agatha hadn’t failed to notice her bra was on said pile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay I love this shirt,” Rio announced. “I may have to steal it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe, but not tonight,” Agatha teased as she stood. She felt Rio’s eyes trail over her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I might steal that shirt at some point too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head and past her to head into the bathroom. “Make yourself at home.”
    </p>
<p>
     When the bathroom door was shut, she released a heavy breath. Rio was going to kill her. She had never wanted someone so much, but she also just wanted to hold her. Was this how it felt when you made a true connection? She didn’t know, but it was enough to make her handshake as she rushed to brush her freshen up and brush her teeth. Still, it took to long, and eventually her impatience got the better of her.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped out of the bathroom and spotted Rio laid out on the bed waiting for her. Without a second thought, she walked over and crawled on top of her, their chests, their legs, their everything touching, apart from their lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re beautiful,” she praised, closing her eyes as Rio’s hands cupped her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re magnificent.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha allowed Rio to pull her down, to crush their lips together, sealing a connection like neither of them had known before.

     The Morning After
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     As always, Agatha woke with the first sign of sunrise, her eyes adjusting to the room’s darkness. She checked the clock and saw it was half 5. Usually, she would just get up and start some work from home, but currently she had a gorgeous woman burrowed into her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her face as light began to faintly filter into the room. Rio looked so peaceful when she slept, her dark hair spread across the pillow behind her. A strand of it had fallen over her face, and Agatha carefully hooked it with her finger and tucked it behind her ear. Rio stirred, only to shuffle closer to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart fluttered, something she hadn’t experienced…well ever. She didn’t do stuff like this: just meeting someone and actually liking them. She never connected with someone like she had last night. They barely did more than kiss, but somehow it had been so intimate. So deep and true.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mind began to run away with itself, but she quickly pulled herself back. She wanted to enjoy the moment. With Rio, in their first morning after.
    </p>
<p>
     She was about to drift back into a light slumber when her phone vibrated on the bedside table.  With a sigh, she reached over to check.
    </p>
<p>
     Two messages from Rebecca.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha carefully pulled away from Rio to sit up and opened the texts.
    </p>

<p>
<em>
      He’s just left the house without his phone. Jeff has gone to look for him.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha got out of bed and rushed into the bathroom, texting as she went.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’m on my way.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Freshening up, she threw on whatever clothes she could find and was about to rush out of the apartment when she caught sight of Rio’s sleeping form once more. Agatha moved and sat on the edge of the bed. She looked too peaceful to wake, and it wasn’t even six in the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite herself, she leaned down and kissed her forehead, before moving through to the living area. She grabbed some sticky notes from her desk and scrubbed down a message.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Morning beautiful,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Sorry family emergency!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      The door pulls shut so leave whenever you want. Make sure to make some breakfast and coffee!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Call me later?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha scribbled down her number and pulled the note from the pad. Looking around the room, she tried to think of a place where Rio would definitely see it. A shuffling sound directed her attention to the cage, where Senõr Scratchy was currently moving around.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” she greeted him with a cup full of food, before securing the sticky note to the bars of the cage. “Make sure she sees this, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Senõr Scratchy was too busy tucking into his breakfast to care.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stole one last glance towards the bedroom, before grabbing her things and rushing out the door.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio woke up to the sound of her weekday phone alarm. Half 7 on the dot. She grumbled and buried her face in the pillow. A pillow that was softer than the one she was used to, and smelt like perfume and-
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled and bit her lip, her hand reaching out to the other side of the bed. Only to be met with a bare and cold mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled herself up, blinking at the light. Looking around the room, Agatha was nowhere to be seen. With a frown, she got out of bed and wandered through to the living area.
    </p>
<p>
     The only person there was Senõr Scratchy, who was too busy nibbling on something to acknowledge her presence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” She called out, but no reply.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked around for a note, even checking the floor in case it fell under something, but there was nothing. Agatha had just left her in her apartment without a word.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went back through to the bedroom and changed back into her now creased clothes, throwing the Fleetwood Mac shirt to the top of the bed with a frustrated growl.
    </p>
<p>
     How could she have been so stupid?
    </p>
<p>
     Checking she hadn’t left anything, she headed out, making a d-tour to see Senõr Scratchy as she went. He had now finished whatever he’d been doing and now looked up at her with an emotionless expression.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell your mom she can rot in hell,” Rio told him, before heading out of the apartment, slamming the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha eventually found her nephew walking down a street a mile or so away from his house. She slowed the car and rolled the passenger window down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     He looked at her, surprised at first before his expression turned to annoyance. “Mom called you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hell yeah she did. Now get in the car!”
    </p>
<p>
     William sighed. “You don’t understand…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha heavy braked. “William Kaplan, if you don’t get in this car right now…”
    </p>
<p>
     He scampered over and climbed in the passenger seat without argument. She unlocked her phone and passed it to him. “Tell your mom I found you and I’m taking you for a drive.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     He sighed and typed out the text as she set off down the street. When he set the phone down, Agatha waited until they were almost out of the neighbourhood they’d found themselves in before speaking, calmer this time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay kid, talk to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     William was silent for a moment, but eventually gave in. “They don’t get me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you ran out the house at 5 in the morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just needed to get away,” he admitted. “I haven’t slept.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I have too much on my mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and pulled up the car. She turned off the engine and adjusted in her seat to face him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     William looked out the window. “I got asked to go on a date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you don’t want to go?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I do,” William insisted. “I really…they’ve been my crush for ages.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then that’s good, isn’t it?” Agatha didn’t understand the new parameters of dating (or the old ones really), but she couldn’t see what was wrong with the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is but…it’s complicated with mom and dad. You know how they are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. She knew her sister and brother-in-law had a tendency to be overprotective, but they had their reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     “You think they won’t like the idea of you dating?”
    </p>
<p>
     William sucked in a deep breath. “I think they won’t like the idea of me dating a boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back in her seat and folded her arms. William stole a glance her way. “You don’t have anything to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like, I don’t know, you’re surprised…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well yes it’s shocked me to my core.”
    </p>
<p>
     He narrowed his eyes. “You knew already, didn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I knew.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. She wasn’t even dignifying that with an answer. “You do know that I’m a lesbian, right? If your parents had a problem with gay people, you wouldn’t even know I existed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not their son, and you’re no-“
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you dare bring that into this,” Agatha warned him. “Look, it’s scary for anyone, but you’re lucky. You have good parents, and even if they didn’t take it well, you have me. I can get an apartment with a spare room, but you’d have to share with Senõr Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     That succeeded in making him laugh. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt your bachelor lifestyle.”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh the irony, Agatha thought.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you think I should just tell them?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I do. We could tell them together? Or we could work out what you could tell them alone? But you’ll need to tell them at some point, and the sooner you do, the sooner you’ll have your mom taking you shopping for a date outfit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d rather you took me,” he admitted. “You’re cooler.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I am, but she’s your mom. Let her have this.”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded in understanding. “Also, I don’t want to be called William anymore. I want to be called Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a snort of laughter. “Good luck convincing your mom of that one.”
    </p>
<p>
     William, Billy, laughed along with her. “Hey, why didn’t you come for dinner last night?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that part of the reason you were upset?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No…well, I was going to talk to you about this last night, then I couldn’t get it out of my head.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, but Mom said it wasn’t for work, so what happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought for a moment, before choosing the truth. “I met someone yesterday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy bolted up in his seat. “You did? What’s her name? What she like?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Her name is Rio and she’s the most bizarre person I’ve ever met.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So she’s cool?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When are you seeing her again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Agatha answered regretfully. “I had to leave her in bed to come look for you…”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy covered his ears. “Please tell me you weren’t having sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?! No! I mean, she stayed over but we neve-why am I explaining myself? Let’s go talk to your parents so I can get back to the city.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And your girl,” Billy added with a smirk, earning him a playful shove.
    </p>
<p>
     As expected, Rebecca and Jeff took it well. Agatha stood by and watched the little family cry and embrace, before both parents looked to her for guidance as the old wise lesbian that she was. Eventually, she managed to slip into the kitchen to check her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Plenty of work emails, but nothing else. Nothing from Rio. It was almost 10. Surely she wasn’t still asleep?
    </p>
<p>
     “William said you were on a date last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Your son is a gossip.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca ignored her comment as she moved to stand beside her. “He said you left her when I text you. I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not. He’s our son, not yours. And now I’ve ruined your love life…”
    </p>
<p>
     “He comes first,” Agatha insisted. “No matter what I’m doing, where I am, who I’m with. If you need me, you call.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca patted her on the shoulder. They weren’t huggers, but that was enough for them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should go to her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I left my number, but she hasn’t text me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then go see if she’s waiting at your apartment. You’ve done enough for us today, so go do something for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her sister’s cheek before rushing out the house.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she got to her apartment building, she still had no texts. Agatha had hoped there would be something. An emoji, a cute little hi. Something she could reply to. Still, she headed up to her apartment with a mix of nervousness and anticipation. In her head, she formed a plan of Rio was still there. Explain what happened, ask if she has any plans that day, then kiss her like their lives depended on it.
    </p>
<p>
     As she walked to her front door, her heart beat heavy in her chest. Scrambling for her keys, she let herself into the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?” She called out as she shut the door, receiving no reply.
    </p>
<p>
     The note was gone from Senõr Scratchy’s cage, and there was no other sign of movement in the room. When she made her way to the bedroom, the only evidence Rio even existed were the screwed-up sheets and the Fleetwood Mac shirt discarded carelessly at the head of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up the shirt and brought it to her nose. It smelled like Rio. A scent that has been saved in her sensory memory.
    </p>
<p>
     Hugging the shirt to her chest, she sat on the end of the bed and called texted Rebecca

     Agatha waited, and waited, and waited.
    </p>
<p>
     It took her two days not to jump for her phone when she got a message, another week after that before she stopped obsessively checking if she had any new messages, and another month after that to stop hoping one would come. In the end, only one thing was certain…
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness had been ghosted, and she didn’t take kindly to that.

<strong>
      One year later…
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     “SHARON!”
    </p>
<p>
     The small lady toddled into Agatha’s office, all smiles like always. “How can I help?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you call the London office and ask them to send me their latest numbers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, sweetie. Do you need anything? Tea? Coffee? Chocolate?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m fine.” Agatha waved her off irritably, but as always Sharon didn’t seem to care.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon was currently her longest running assistant. She’d had enough of the fresh graduate crowd, so took a shot with the recent widow who ‘wanted to look after someone’. Her longest assistant before had lasted a month. So far, Sharon had lasted seven.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh and Jen called. She said you need to answer her texts.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Jen hasn’t text me.” Agatha reached for her phone and saw she had five messages and two missed calls.
    </p>
<p>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “I’ll call her now.”
    </p>
<p>
     She waiting until Sharon was out of the room before calling her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen answered on the third ring.
     <em>
      “Do you every answer your phone?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “If you gave me chance,” Agatha huffed. “What’s happening tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I need you to meet me at Josie’s Bar at eight.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You know I’m seeing that girl…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. She should have known. Jen had met a girl a month or so ago and hadn’t shut up about her since. While she was pleased her friend was happy, she was sick of hearing about the woman, and she hadn’t even met her yet.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Well, she wants me to meet her sister, and she asked if I had a friend, so she wasn’t a third wheel.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “This better not be a date,” Agatha warned, to which Jen laughed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You think I’d let you date my girlfriend’s sister? I actually want this relationship to work.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “So it’s official now, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Shut up,”
     </em>
     Jen huffed.
     <em>
      “See you at eight?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine, I’ll be there.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Great, and wear something sexy.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why would I…”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen hung up the phone, and Agatha cursed under her breath. She knew this was a set up. Her (only) friend and her sister had been playing matchmaker since the ghosting incident. But Agatha Harkness didn’t believe in love anymore, at least not romantic love.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked at the framed picture of her and Billy on her desk and smiled softly. He was doing better. He’d met a nice boy and seemed to be a lot more settled. There were still down moments, times when he regressed, but it was mostly fine. In a way she was glad Rio left her, as it meant she could devote herself to her work and her family.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she never wanted to see her face again.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
     Rio woke to the sound of the blender, and instantly cursed every decision she had made in her life. The blender meant one thing: smoothie day.
    </p>
<p>
     She got up and pushed her hair back out of her face. Throwing on a hoodie, she dragged herself out of bed and stumbled towards the noise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia,” she groaned as she staggered towards the kitchen, a hand over her face to conceal her eyes from the sunlight. “Why do you always blend so early.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s almost 9,” her roommate shouted over the blender. “And you need nutrients.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I need sleep! I was working late last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned off the blender and checked the contents. “What you need is a proper schedule. You’re acting like a college student.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am a college student.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re 18 months away from a doctorate,” Lilia reminded her as she poured the smoothie into two glasses. “You need to toughen up and think about your life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay mom,” Rio sassed, but accepted the smoothie. They weren’t that bad really, but she preferred the over-sugary cereal Lilia disapproved of.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia was older, wiser. She didn’t have any kids, too busy with her boutique and her famous tarot readings. Rio had expected their relationship to be unique when she answered Lilia’s ad for a roommate. What she didn’t expect was to become a pseudo daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as they were about to sit at the table, Rio heard her phone ringing in her bedroom,
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit.” She put down her smoothie and ran through, her heart dropping when she saw it was Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice never called.
    </p>
<p>
     She scrambled to answer. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Nothing,”
     </em>
     her stepsister assured.
     <em>
      “Just checking we’re still on for tonight.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Please say you didn’t forget…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I didn’t,” Rio insisted. “Just remind me when and where we’re meeting again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed.
     <em>
      “Josie’s Bar at eight. You’re meeting Jen, remember?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh yes. Jen.” How could Rio forget? Honestly, she thought she got down bad, but Alice was making her look hard to get. Jen this, Jen that. Not a conversation went by without Jen, Jen, Jen.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah well she’s just called and said she’s bringing a friend.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio put a hand on her hip. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “So you’re not a third wheel.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “So it’s not a double date?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Totally not,”
     </em>
     Alice answered.
     <em>
      “But Jen did say she’s single.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was Rio’s turn to sigh. “You know I’m over the whole dating scene.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Just because you had a bad experience…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t ‘Just’ anything and you know that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had been the first person to see her
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     morning after. She held her as she cried, calmed her as she raged. It wasn’t a bad date, or even a bad break up; it was Rio losing faith in love. All because she’d been stupid enough to think a random woman in a coffee shop was her soulmate.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I know,”
     </em>
     Alice replied.
     <em>
      “I just want you to be happy.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I am happy,” Rio insisted. “I have you, and Lilia, and Webbers.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You have your sister, your roommate who is twice your age, and a spider.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Tarantula.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Whatever. Just come tonight and meet Jen, and see what her friend is like. Okay?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rubbed a hand over her face. “What’s her friend’s name?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agnes I think?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Fine, okay, I’ll see you then.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Wear something nice.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Fuck you. My fashion sense is flawless.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice laughed and hung up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tossed her phone back on her bed and, after a moment’s thought, headed back to the living area.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?” Lilia was sat at the table with her smoothie in one hand and her phone in the other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you do me a reading?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia looked at her in surprise. “You hate my readings.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t. I just sometimes disagree with them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, pass me the cards on the table.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio retrieved the aged box of cards and handed them to Lilia as she moved to sit opposite her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia unboxed the cards. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just your usual past, present, future.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia knocked on the cards and shuffled them, before laying three on the table. She turned the past card, revealing the Three of Swords. Rio glared at it. “I always get that one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The cards don’t lie,” Lilia reminded her, but didn’t repeat the meaning of the card. Rio already knew the score: grief, heartbreak, pain. She guessed it had some truth to it.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned the present card- the Six of Cups.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a new one,” Rio commented. “What does it mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It means something from the past will be coming to the present.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not that kind of psychic.” Lilia turned over the future card, only to tense. “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
     “‘Oh’ what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia blinked at the card. “The Tower Reversed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There are no bad cards,” Lilia insisted. “It could mean a number of things.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Such as?” Rio pressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mostly, it warns that you’re going to go through a great change.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What kind of change?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t answer that, doll.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled and got to her feet. She hated those stupid cards.
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t have to be a big change,” Lilia reassured. “Just a big one.”
    </p>
<p>
     In Rio’s experience, all big changes were bad.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m meeting Alice tonight,” she announced. “Don’t wait up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be up anyway,” Lilia replied, and Rio knew that would be true. Lilia didn’t sleep much.
    </p>
<p>
     “You never know,” Rio said with a smirk. “I might meet my Six of Cups.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Lilia agreed with a sad smile. “Just…be careful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, though she wasn’t worried. It was only a stupid deck of cards.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha left work around 6 and headed home. She ate some leftover pizza and fed Senõr Scratchy, yet instead of her usual nightly routine of cuddling up with a good book, she ransacked her wardrobe and headed out in a slick black pantsuit over a black corset top.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen said look sexy, so she’d make her eat her words. If she was feeling really spiteful, she might have made a point of seduced her future sister-in-law, but she decided to settle on getting everyone in the room to fixate on her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She was just down the street from the bar when Jen called.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Where are you?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s not even 8 yet,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “But we’re all here already.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “And that’s my problem because?”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Jen curse.
     <em>
      “Where are you, Agatha?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Literally down the street.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’m stood outside.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn’t long before Agatha spotted her. Jen was wearing a long pink sundress which was too chilly for a September night, but she looked amazing, nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     When Jen saw her, she stomped over. “I’m sorry for snapping but I’m nervous.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because her sister looks super scary.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you spoken to her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I saw them in there and ran back out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head in disgrace. “I thought I taught you better than this. Be the scariest person in the room.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to scare her. I want to impress her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “This is pathetic,” Agatha said with grimace. “Take us inside.”
    </p>
<p>
     She followed Jen back into the bar, trailing her path through the crowd. Agatha spotted a short woman with bright red streaks in her hair rushing towards them before embracing Jen in a tight hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re here!” The woman’s voice was full of glee, and Jen’s smile was unlike any Agatha had seen before. They were already sickening.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s your sister?” Jen asked once they pulled apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s just getting drinks,” the woman, Alice, looked past Jen to Agatha and smiled. “Is this your friend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Jen moved to reveal Agatha fully. “Alice, this is…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart dropped in her chest. She knew that voice. She could never forget that voice.
    </p>
<p>
     A familiar face appeared beside Alice, who looked equally surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips. “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” Jen cursed. “Agatha, I didn’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head. Annoyingly, she was still beautiful, but her eyes had changed. They were no longer filled with adoration and desire. No, they were darker. Hateful.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been a long time,” Rio commented. “Picked up any girls in coffee shops recently?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Why, you jealous?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed bitterly. “No, why? Do you want me to be?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want nothing to do with you,” Agatha bit back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay.” Alice stepped between them. “Let’s calm down and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I see you for who you really are,” Rio accused, ignoring her sister’s attempt at peace. “A coward.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha growled in anger, wanting to wipe the smug look off Rio’s face, but instead stormed off towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it, run away,” she heard Rio call after her. “It’s what you’re good at.”
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha got outside, she stopped and sucked in a deep breath. This couldn’t be happening.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Jen stood beside her. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t know, I swear.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to see her,” Agatha insisted. “I won’t go back in there and I won’t see her again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No Jen,” she snapped. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t wait for Jen’s answer and stormed back down the street. She needed to get as far away from Rio as she could get. She never wanted to be anywhere near her again.
     <br/>
<br/>
     Rio knocked back another shot before slamming her hand on the bar. “Another.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, stop,” Alice ordered, but Rio accepted the shot and gulped it down.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m having fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, no one else is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went to wave at the bartender again, but Alice pulled her arm down. “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, I’m sorry. I must have misheard her name.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked at her sister. “No, I’m glad. I’ve been wanting to piss her off for a year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you’re upset,” Alice insisted, “I saw the way you looked at her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “With a thirst for revenge?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Alice countered. “With grief and pain.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her, the three of swords flashing in her mind. “What did you just say?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice didn’t respond, instead her attention was caught by something in the crowd. Rio followed her gaze and saw Jen walking towards them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, where’s Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s gone, and I’m going to head off too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Alice took hold of Jen’s hands. “You don’t have to, us three…”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen met Rio’s gaze and shot her an icy glare, before looking back to Alice with neutral expression. “I’ll call you tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen kissed Alice’s cheek, before walking away. Rio watched as her sister’s shoulders slumped and felt a little bad about it. A little. She was totally in the right; she just wished Alice wasn’t caught in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we going home?” She asked Alice, who simply nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     They shared a cab home: Alice only lived a block from her apartment, so Rio walked the rest of the way home. Her mind was fixed on one thing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The look on her face when their eyes met. The tiny spark of pain when Rio called her out. The way she ran away. It all satisfied the itch for revenge she had for so long, but it still wasn’t enough to make her feel any better.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn’t help that she still looked like a sexy sapphic goddess.
    </p>
<p>
     When she walked into the apartment, Lilia was sat on the couch watching the shopping channel, but quickly turned it off. Worst thing about living with a psychic? They knew when something was up.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your stupid cards were right.” Rio slumped onto the couch beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You met your six of cups I take it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio got up and walked to the kitchen, grabbing beer for herself and a coke can for Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I ever tell you about Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia accepted the can. “I don’t think so?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio settled back on the couch, her legs crossed. “She’s my six of cups, and my three of swords.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia nodded in understanding. “Tell me everything.”
     <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Taking a sip of her own beer, Agatha looked out over the city lights. She wasn’t paying much attention to it; just distracting her eyes while her mind went over the evening’s events.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Why did it have to be Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     Jen could have met anyone, anyone, and it was Rio’s stepsister. Oh, how the universe liked to torment her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha downed the rest of her whisky and headed over to Senõr Scratchy’s cage. Picking him up, she hugged him to her chest. He was a big boy now, which made him twice as cuddly. She rubbed her chin against the top of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw Rio again,” she told him. “She might have gotten the upper hand this time but trust me. She’ll learn I’m not someone to be messed with.”

<p>
     Rio had spent the next day studying a new specimen of dried azalea that had been found in a library book in Colorado. The librarian that discovered it had ended up in an induced coma, while others who handled it ended up in hospital. Everyone survived, so not too exciting, but the neurotoxins in the samples were still fascinating.
    </p>
<p>
     After decontamination, Rio returned home from the college to find Alice and Lilia sat at the dining table.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is this? An intervention?” she joked, but neither of them laughed. “Okay, what’s going on?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to talk to you,” Alice announced. “It’s important.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…” Rio sat at the head of the table. “What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I talked with Jen, and she told me Agatha’s version of that morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She did?” Rio folded her arms. “What did she say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That she left a note with her number on it, and you never called.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t leave anything,” Rio insisted. “Besides me, anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, that’s what Jen said.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, because your girlfriend is the fountain of all truths.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Lilia warned.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? I was the one there. I know what happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just let Alice finish.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stuck her middle finger up at her, which Lilia simply tutted at.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen told me why Agatha left,” Alice continued. “And we think maybe she thought she’d written the note but forgot in the moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How could she forget?” Rio questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her nephew had run away,” Alice explained. “She had to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, for the slightest of seconds, felt guilty…only to quickly think better of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “She could have woken me up if it was an emergency.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia scoffed. “Would be easier to wake the dead.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice cleared her throat. “Either way, Jen and I talked, and we think this is a big misunderstanding.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was about to ask why Alice and her stupid girlfriend felt the need to pass judgement on the situation, but a more important question came to mind. “What does Agatha think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen’s going to talk to her today,” Alice answered. “We want us all to be able to move on from this. You’re my sister, and Agatha is Jen’s best friend. We can’t go on like this, especially over a…”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you say misunderstanding one more time, I’m going to stab you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Used to her sister’s antics, Alice appeared more exasperated than threatened. “Well?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair. “If Agatha admits she forgot the note, I’ll think about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia looked to Alice. “Think that’s as good as you’ll get.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded in defeat. “I’ll take it. So if we organise a meet between you two…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a show of sighing. “I guess I’ll be the bigger person and talk with her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grinned and jumped to her feet. “This is great! Let me call, Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Alice run into her room with a skip in her step. She smiled to herself, only for it to drop when she caught Lilia’s eye. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you plotting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not plotting,” Rio insisted with mock insult. “I’m accepting peace negotiations.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice likes that girl,” Lilia warned. “Don’t mess this up for her, or for yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “For me?” Rio questioned, only to be interrupted by a loud scream.
    </p>
<p>
     “RIO!” YOUR SPIDER IS ON THE LOOSE AGAIN!”
    </p>
<p>
     With a cackle, Rio raced to her room, missing Lilia laying her tarot cards on the table.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I said no.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Look, Rio is up for settling this,”
     </em>
     Jen snapped.
     <em>
      “Why can’t you do this for me?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha clenched her jaw as she turned onto a new street. The only thing worse than Jen nagging her was Jen nagging her through her car’s surround-sound stereo.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you I never want to see her again.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Over a misunderstanding?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I told you there was no misunderstanding,” Agatha stated sternly. “I didn’t forget the note. She’s lying.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Why would she lie?”
     </em>
     Jen questioned.
     <em>
      “Alice said she was a wreck afterwards.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Maybe because she’s a psychopath.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You can’t say things like that, Agatha.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well I just did, and just because you want to hang out with the weird sisters doesn’t mean I have to.” Agatha pulled into her sister’s driveway. “I’ve got to go.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’ll send you Rio’s number,”
     </em>
     Jen declared, still unswayed by Agatha’s protests.
     <em>
      “Maybe when you’ve calmed down, you’ll realise how childish you’re be-.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hung up the call and put the car in park.
    </p>
<p>
     Her sister’s house was a world away from her life in the city. The street was quiet, with trees and lawns and an illusion of safety. Agatha walked up the drive and tried the front door, finding it was unlocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know anyone could just walk in,” she called out as she did just that.
    </p>
<p>
     A rush of footsteps rumbled above her, and soon Billy came hurtling down the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re late,” he commented as he walked towards her, arms open.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fashionably,” she added, wrapping her arms around him. Agatha didn’t hug, but she made an exception for Billy. Sometimes holding him was the only thing that calmed the conflicts in her mind. Because she could feel him, warm and solid. Alive and well. That was all that mattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy pulled away and smiled at her with adoration. “Mum and dad are in the kitchen.”
    </p>
<p>
     She followed her nephew to the back of the house and found her sister preparing a salad bowl while Jeff worked on turning steaks on the grill.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at you two,” she teased. “All domestic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve been married for 19 years,” Jeff reminded her, but Agatha waved him off.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re late,” her sister commented. Like mother like son.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just shrugged. “Traffic.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could tell Rebecca didn’t believe her. Her sister probably thought it was work, but it wasn’t. Agatha had been on and off the phone with Jen all day; over and over asking if she could have just ‘thought’ she wrote that damn note for Rio. Like she was trying to convince her she’d made it up. Unfortunately for her, Agatha’s mind was impenetrable, and her excellent memory was fuelled by her signature stubbornness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha set the table with Billy and helped carry the food through. They went through their usual routine: Jeff talked about work, Rebecca about the neighbours, and Billy complained about a project for school.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate science.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to pass,” his mother reminded him. “You need to make up for that mid-term.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but it’s hard.” Billy looked to his aunt. “Right, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up from her plate. “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca put her cutlery down. “Okay, what’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Agatha quickly replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that why you’ve been too busy pushing your food around to listen to the conversation.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was listening,” Agatha argued defensively.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t call the little old lady down the street a bitch, and you didn’t even bite when Jeff said he dinted his car in the McDonalds drive thru.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed loudly. “What happened? Did the big shiny M distract you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff, however, was unaffected. “That would have worked five minutes ago, but you missed your moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was about to shoot back an insult when her watch vibrated against her wrist. She checked it and saw a message from Jen.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Jen
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Here is Rio’s number. Just think about it please!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha scowled down at the digits. She didn’t know who she hated more: Rio or Jen for making her think about Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong?” Billy asked with clear worry. “And don’t lie.”
    </p>
<p>
     She waved him off. “Just some personal stuff. Nothing I can’t ignore and make go away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because that’s a really good coping mechanism,” Rebecca commented. Agatha shot her a glare.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me what’s happened,” Billy pleaded and, unable to deny her nephew anything, Agatha gave in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you remember that woman I met in a coffee shop last year?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The day before I ran away?” Billy questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t forget that day,” Jeff added. “My blood pressure…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up, Jeff,” Rebecca stopped him, before her eyes fixed on Agatha. “The woman who ghosted you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, yes,” Agatha confirmed. “Well, she just happens to be the sister of Jen’s new girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No way!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, neither of us knew until we unknowingly agreed to meet at a bar,” Agatha continued. “She was a bitch, and I walked out. Now Jen wants us to work things out, so it doesn’t affect her relationship.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would you work things out with her?” Billy asked. “She hurt you for no reason.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She says I didn’t leave a note,” Agatha explained. “Even though I most certainly did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did,” Rebecca confirmed. “You told me you did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Jen keeps asking me if I’m sure that I did and even though I’ve
     <em>
      told
     </em>
     her I am, she’s still not convinced. And now she’s sent me Rio’s number.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to text her,” Billy insisted. “You need to face her so you can move on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she needs to stay away from her,” Rebecca argued. “That woman will only hurt her even more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m right here,” Agatha reminded them, before looking to her brother-in-law. “What do you have to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, is she still hot?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeff!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dad!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Annoyingly, yes,”
    </p>
<p>
     “This is so gross,” Billy grimaced. “I kind of want to see her though. Do you have a picture?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. “Why would I want a picture of her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy seemed to think for a moment before a mischievous grin appeared on his face. “I just need to check something!”
    </p>
<p>
     “What…” Agatha watched her nephew jump up from his chair and bolt out the room. “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     She ran after him, chasing him up the stairs and through to his room. Her nephew was faster though, and he had already gotten onto his phone by the time she caught up with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Finding Rio,” he announced. “What’s Jen’s last name again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not tell…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Never mind. I’ve found her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was interrupted by her sister walking into the room. “What’s going on?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your son is antagonising me again,” Agatha accused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, and I wonder where he got that from.” Rebecca moved to stand by Billy. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sleuthing,” he told her. “Okay, I’ve found Jen’s girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How?” Agatha repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy held his phone to show her the screen. It was a picture of Alice kissing Jen’s cheek with the caption ‘she’s pretty cute’, accompanied by way too many heart emojis. It made her feel sick.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh good, she’s tagged her,” Billy tapped at his phone. “Now let’s see if I can find Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down on the edge of his bed. She was so glad she didn’t have social media.
    </p>
<p>
     She watched as Billy scrolled and Rebecca supervised. Naively, she hoped Alice hadn’t posted anything of her sister, but unfortunately it seemed the pair were annoyingly close.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gasped. “Is this her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh she’s gorgeous,” Rebecca commented, earning surprised looks from her son and sister. “What, she is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood up to look at the photo. It was taken on what looked like a fire escape, Alice grinning while Rio smirked, holding a cigarette close to her lips. She did indeed look (annoyingly) gorgeous.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy clicked on Rio’s tagged profile (
     <em>
      poisonhag
     </em>
     , which Agatha thought fit her perfectly) only to find it was private. “Should I request her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” his mother and aunt replied in unison. He pouted but went back to the photo. “Even I can see why me running away was a big inconvenience for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew he was joking, but she still didn’t like it. “You’ve never inconvenienced me, and it was probably for the best anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, can I join the party?” Jeff asked as he walked in. He moved to stand next to his wife and peered down at the phone. “Who’s who?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That one is Jen’s girlfriend,” Billy explained. “And that is Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff looked at Agatha sympathetically. “You weren’t kidding. She’s hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca elbowed him in the side.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Can you not see…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop digging your own grave, Dad,” Billy teased, earning a smirk from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that’s my job.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca sighed. “Can we get back to the matter at hand? Now I know what she looks like, I can see the appeal, but I still think you should stay away from her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why Mom? She looks cool.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She broke your aunt’s heart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough.” Agatha held up her hands to silence them. “Dinner will be getting cold. My love life can wait.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy smiled. “See, she said love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Downstairs,” all three adults told him, and Billy did as he was told.
    </p>
<p>
     “I swear he gets more like you every time you visit,” Rebcca huffed at her sister as she went to follow her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Agatha grinned, before she looked to her brother-in-law. “Well?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff patted her on the back. “Just do what you think is right. Gotta trust your gut.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave him a thankful smile, and the pair headed back downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful, and the Kaplan’s did give her the curtesy of not bringing Rio up again (even if she could tell Billy was desperate to do so).
    </p>
<p>
     When she made it back to her apartment, Agatha still hadn’t made up her mind on what to do. She went through her usual night routine: completed chores, picked out her outfit for the next day, then had cuddles and snuggles with Senõr Scratchy, before tucking into reading a manuscript draft.
    </p>
<p>
     Usually, she accompanied it with a glass of whisky, but that night, she decided to brew some tea. Warming, calming, soothing. Still, she had read the first page three times and couldn’t take in a word of it. She was too busy thinking about Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The pressure from Jen, the eagerness from Billy, the reluctance from Rebecca. They’d thrown her internal compass out of its usually trustworthy alignment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish you could talk,” she said to Senõr Scratchy, who was nibbling on some fresh veg she’d thrown in for him. “You’d probably give me some good advice.”
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, the only constructive advice had come from Jeff, which was quite unnerving.
    </p>
<p>
     “Follow my gut,” she muttered to herself. “You know what? Fuck it.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled out her phone and added Rio’s number to her contacts. Despite her temptation to give her an insulting nickname, she didn’t want to give the woman any more of her time, so she was simply Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened up a message and typed a few versions out:
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave me your number so what do you want?
    </p>
<p>
     Hey bitch heard you’ve been lying.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck you I hate your guts!
    </p>
<p>
     In the end, she settled on something bland and sent it before she could overthink anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     “There,” she said to Senõr Scratchy once more. “Now Jen can stop nagging.”
    </p>
<p>
     Senõr Scratchy peered at her out of his cage for a moment before continuing with his feast.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was sat on the fire escape outside of her bedroom window. She leaned against the mental rail, watching the world go by while taking drags of her cigarette.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia didn’t like her smoking inside, which is one of the reasons she shifted to just doing it socially. Beore she met Agatha, she used to smoke a pack every three days. After Agatha, she smoked two packs per day, some days more, until she moved out of Alice’s place. It had taken her five weeks to finish her last pack, but since Agatha came back into her life, she had gone through another in a matter of days.
    </p>
<p>
     It calmed her, sitting out on the fire escape with the golden glow from the streetlight illuminating the paths and roads, while sharpening the shadows of those walking by. The city was never quiet, but she found this time of night the closest to tranquil it could get.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone vibrated on the windowsill, and she leaned over to retrieve it. She saw the message and almost dropped her cigarette through the grate.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      (Unsaved number)
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Hey it’s Agatha. Jen gave me your number.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grinned wickedly. Oh, this was going to be fun. She saved Agatha’s number before typing back a reply.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Well, well, well. This is a surprise.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She took another drag of her cigarette, and by the time she had finished favouring the nicotine, she’d got a reply.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Yeah, yeah. Jen wants us to talk.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She pursed her lips as she responded.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Alice wants the same. What are we going to do about that?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      You free 2pm tomorrow?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. Oh this was too good.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Very specific.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Well?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I can be. Shall we meet at our coffee shop?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Fine.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      See you then sweetheart!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stubbed out her cigarette. She had some plotting to do.
    </p>

<p>
     Agatha paced outside of the coffee shop. People were looking at her like she’d gone crazy, but she had a good reason.
    </p>
<p>
     They agreed 2pm. It was currently 2:13. Rio was late.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hated lateness.
    </p>
<p>
     She checked her phone again, and saw she had no messages, no missed calls. Nothing. Cursing under her breath, she called her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio answered almost straight away:
     <em>
      Hello?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re nearly 15 minutes late,” Agatha snapped. “Where are you?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Chillax m’lady. Turn around.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha whirled round and saw Rio walking towards her. She was casual: baggy jeans, white t-shirt, with a black denim shirt over the top. Irritatingly adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hung up the phone and smiled at her. “Sorry. I took the wrong subway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s bullshit detector started ringing, but she chose to ignore it. She gestured to the door. “Ladies first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sauntered in and Agatha followed, only to end up ahead when they reached the counter. Unlike the last time they were both there, the place was pretty quiet. The barista was different also and greeted them both with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “What can I get for you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A black coffee and an iced coffee please.” Agatha glanced back to Rio, who appeared surprised. “Is that still your order?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and shot her a smile that was too wide to be genuine. Agatha looked away from her. She wasn’t in the mood for her antics.
    </p>
<p>
     The barista prepared their drinks and handed them over. Agatha swiped her cup and marched towards a vacant table by the window. She didn’t look back to see if Rio was following, but by the time she was sitting in her seat, the other woman was already settled opposite to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Agatha began.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Rio repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in awkward silence, neither willing to begin peace discussions. It seemed they had met each other’s matches in the stubborn department. Annoyingly, it was Rio that eventually had the guts to start.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice said you left a note.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s true,” Agatha stated. “Jen said you couldn’t find it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Maybe because there wasn’t one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, there was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay then.” Rio leaned forward in her chair. “Where was it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh no,” Agatha protested. “I’m not playing this game.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what game shall we play?” Rio challenged. “Because you seem very committed to your little lie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clenched her jaw. “I’m not lying.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well neither am I.”
    </p>
<p>
     She was, Agatha was sure, but this was getting them nowhere.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you,” she admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you too,” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I love Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I love Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So what are we going to do about this?” Agatha questioned. “Because I’m sick of Jen nagging me, and I imagine you’re the same with Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice doesn’t nag; she politely pesters.”
    </p>
<p>
     Weirdo, Agatha thought, but kept her outward civility. “They might not be together forever. Jen’s relationships don’t usually last long.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Same with Alice,” Rio added. “So what do you suggest? We just pretend we’re okay until then?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think I’m that good an actor,” Agatha grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s our only option.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So what?” Agatha questioned. “We just tell them we’re okay now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. “No, silly. They won’t believe us until they see it. Why don’t we suggest a second take of our little meet-up, give them what they want, then forever make excuses why we can’t see each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha eyed her suspiciously. “You’ve thought this through.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have,” Rio confirmed. “So what do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     The plan was scheming, manipulative, and downright yet devious. It was perfect, though she refused to admit it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well it’s the only plan we have.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a sip of her iced coffee, and to anyone else she would look the picture of innocence. “So we’re doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I suppose,” Agatha reluctantly agreed. “But you’re organizing this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh it will be my pleasure,” Rio grinned. “So, what do you think…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s phone beeped and she saw it was the planned reminder she had asked Sharon to send fifteen minutes before her next meeting. “I’ve got to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smiled dropped. “What? Now? We’ve barely sat down.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you 2pm,” Agatha reminded her. “I’m a busy lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Text me the details,” she ordered before waving. “Au revoir.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked out with her head help high, confident she had established her high ground.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio, on the other hand, thought everything was going to plan.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t been late. She had actually been twenty minutes early, finding herself a good hiding spot so she could watch for Agatha’s arrival. Soon enough, she arrived and stood outside the coffee shop, dressed in a navy power suit that made it all the sweeter.
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Agatha checking the time, her patience thinning by the second. Watched her pace and check her phone. Only when she turned her back and put her phone to her ear did Rio begin to walk towards her, answering the call with a wicked grin.
    </p>
<p>
     What she hadn’t expected, however, was for Agatha to remember her coffee order. It wasn’t a complex one. Pretty generic, really. Still, she remembered it, and Rio couldn’t help but wonder what else she remembered. Because she remembered everything about Agatha. Everything. Down to the smell of her pillows in the morning, with the perfume that caught her nostrils as Agatha moved by her to grab her coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     God, she hated how much it affected her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let the conversation run naturally, then dropped in her little plan. A plan Agatha was more than happy to go along with. Her plan B was blackmail, which would have been fun, but perhaps not as effective.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she needed Agatha in a false sense of control, and by the way she dismissed her with that teasing little wave, Rio knew she had her exactly where she wanted her.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was very happy with the news. She suggested they meet for drinks the next night. Same place and time as before. Rio had happily agreed and ticked off another part of her scheme.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia commented that Rio had been smiling most of the evening, but Rio kept her reasonings to herself. Why spoil the big surprise?
    </p>
<p>
     When Lilia decided to put on Real Housewives, Rio excused herself to sit in her room. She got Webbers out of her enclosure and allowed the tarantula to run up and down her left arm, while her right was other occupied setting in motion the next phase of her plan.

     Rio grinned in delight. Oh, how she was going to make her regret saying that. She thought for a moment, before messaging her again.

</p>
<p>

      Nothing.

</p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped replying after that.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cackled and manoeuvred Webbers into her palm. She lifted her up so her many eyes met hers. “Mommy is an evil mastermind, isn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Webbers wiggled one of her legs at her and she grinned. This was going to be so much fun.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha arrived at the bar wearing her favourite leather jacket and a simple black dress that hugged her hips just the way she liked it. She wanted to look like she didn’t make much of an effort, but she also wanted to put Rio in a tailspin. (Just like she had been in the night before, her mind plagued with images of Rio in ‘nothing’).
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice were sat at a table, Jen’s bag reserving a seat to her left while Alice guarded the one to her right with her boot-clad foot.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen smiled when she saw her and put her bag on the floor. “Here’s my best friend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hung her jacket on the back of her chair and sat down. “Just because I did as you asked.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And did it go so bad?” Alice asked, smiling with the false knowledge Rio had planted.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice shared a smile, and Agatha hid her grimace by looking at her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy had sent her a message.
    </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was about to type out a list of reasons why she would never, ever, join Instagram when she saw Alice wave at someone behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, over here!”
    </p>
<p>
     Forgetting her phone, she turned in her seat to see Rio striding towards them. She was wearing black slacks with a red blouse that cut low enough to show she wasn’t wearing a bra. Agatha quickly turned back to her phone, making a show of not caring.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>

    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      We’ll talk about it later.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Jen scolded. “Leave your work emails alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, it was Billy.” Agatha looked to Rio, who was now sat next to her. She forced a smile. “Hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Rio beamed. “Do you not have a drink?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I only just got here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood again. “Come on then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to protest, but she could feel Jen and Alice watching them closely, so put on another smile and followed Rio to the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     “What have they said so far?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing, really. They were too busy staring into each other’s eyes and I was too busy trying to deal with my nephew.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved over the bartender. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll order,” Agatha insisted. “What do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’ll get these,” Rio insisted. “You got the coffees.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a six-figure salary,” Agatha reminded her. “You can pay me back by not making this evening unbearable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “That was almost a perfect sentence.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at her with a confused frown, before deciding she didn’t want to know. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you’re having.”
    </p>
<p>
     The bartender reached them- a blonde twenty-something with a septum piercing and arms covered in tattoos. She looked at Rio first, before her eyes raked over Agatha with a delighted gleam. “What can I get you, gorgeous?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Two whiskeys on ice,” she answered, unfazed. Though she was a pretty little thing, she wasn’t Agatha’s type.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coming right up,” the bartender said with a wink. Agatha heard Rio mumble something beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t say anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     The bartender came over with the drinks. “Shall I start you a tab?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we’re good,” Rio spoke for her. “Aren’t we, sweetheart?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chose to ignore Rio’s teasing and paid for the drinks, before picking them both up of the counter. She carried them over, all too aware of Rio’s presence behind her, and placed the glasses onto the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at you,” Jen praised. “All gentlemanly.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot her a warning look as she sat down.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked between her and Rio with an excited grin. “So, tell us how you two ended up burying the hatchet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rio, who was all to happy to step up. “Well, she texted me after Jen sent over my number, and we started texting back and forth, then we called and talked about what happened. We met up yesterday and we realised something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and took some sips of her whiskey. She knew Rio would make this weird.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Alice asked. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That we still have feelings for each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chocked on her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, Agatha!” Jen patted her on the back. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and tried to catch her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry Aggie.” Rio placed a hand on her shoulder. “I know we were going to keep it to ourselves, but after last night and this morning I just…I can’t contain myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen hid her head in her hands. “Okay I don’t need to hear about my best friend having sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or my sister,” Alice added with equal disgust.
    </p>
<p>
     “We didn’t have sex,” Agatha insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s right,” Rio added. “We’re taking things slow, or at least we were. I don’t know, honey. I don’t think I can keep my hands off you for much longer.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen got up. “I need to go to the bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice watched her girlfriend go before looking to her sister in horror. “Is this a joke?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was about to take the out, but Rio beat her to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, this is real.” She captured Agatha’s hand on the table. “I’m sorry if this causes any issues for you guys, but technically I got there first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know what to do. Usually, she could talk herself out of anything, make everyone around her feel inferior and assert her dominance. Yet her mind wouldn’t work. No witty comments, no sarcastic remarks, nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     The shock seemed to wear off Alice at least, and she smiled. “This is actually great.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is?” Agatha questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, we can have cute double dates.”
    </p>
<p>
     This was a living nightmare.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the night went by in a daze of lovey dovey nonsense and Rio using any opportunity to turn the conversation to their ‘relationship’. After a few rounds, Jen and Alice said they were calling it a night, so the four of them headed out to wave down some cabs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sharing with us?” Alice asked Rio when Jen managed to get a cab, who shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to have a smoke first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll make sure she gets home,” she answered. Oh, she was not done with Rio tonight. Not by a long shot. She waited until the cab drove away before she stormed over to Rio. “What the hell was that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t reply, just lit her cigarette and took a drag. “Damn that’s good. Want one?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t. Why the hell did you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked as she blew out a cloud of smoke. “You said I could make up the story.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, the story. Not a fake relationship. You’re going to fix this right now!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a show of thinking. “Erm, let me see…nope!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because seeing you struggle, seeing you squirm. It really warms the heart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have a heart,” Agatha accused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I do. It’s black.” Rio batted her eyelashes ridiculously. “And it beats for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Blowing a puff of smoke in Agatha’s direction, Rio turned on her heel and walked towards a taxi that had just pulled up. Stubbing out her cigarette on a lamppost, she tossed Agatha a teasing wave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te veo”.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared at the disappearing cab. It seemed she had underestimated her rival, but two could play at that game.

<p>
     Rio waited in the foyer for the building; on a sofa that was probably more expensive than her and Lilia’s apartment, watching people walk by in suits that were also probably more expensive than her and Lilia’s apartment. And there she sat in her baggy jeans, bobbly black sweater, and off-white converse. Very out of place.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet she had been invited, with her first name at the front desk, and given the instruction to sit there until someone came to get her.
    </p>
<p>
     That someone turned out to be a tiny grandma with a big smile. “Are you Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am.” Rio got to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ms Harkness asked if I’d come down and get you. Please, follow me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio followed the woman to the elevator and waited until the doors closed to speak again. “Do you work for Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m her assistant,” the woman replied, holding out her hand. “Sharon Davis.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took her hand and shook it firmly. “Rio Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator opened on the twelfth floor, and Sharon led her out into an open space of desks, an expensive suit person sat at each one. They watched her as she followed Sharon across the room, all likely wondering what a girl like her was doing in a place like that.
    </p>
<p>
     Turning a corner at the far side of the room, Sharon stopped by a lone desk and picked up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, Miss Vidal is here for you…Yes, that’s her.” Sharon put the phone down and pointed to the door opposite. “She says go in when you’re ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the door, willing her legs to move. Messing with Agatha was all fun and games in the outside world but in this office, in this building, she had to admit she was a little intimidated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here.” Sharon handed her a polka dot backing tin. “That’ll soften her up for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Rio gave the woman a small smile before making her way through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s office was huge. Bigger than her apartment huge, with a conference table, an area with couches surrounding a TV, and bookshelves. Lots of those. She spotted Agatha sat at her large desk, her back to her as she stared out the window.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shut the office door and carried the baking tin across the room towards her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness,” she tested the name on her lips. “It suits you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at her and pointed to the chair opposite. “Sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat and put the tin on the desk. Agatha eyed it suspiciously. “What’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your assistant told me to bring it in.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward and tore off the lid, before shoving her hand in and retrieving a cookie. “This is why you hire a grandmother.” She took a bite out of the cookie and groaned in a way that made Rio slightly envious. “Fuck me, those are good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Curious, Rio took one and cautiously bit into it, only to moan in ecstasy. “Did she make these?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She did, now let’s cut to the chance.” Agatha placed her cookie down on her desk and folded her arms. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?” Rio asked through a mouthful of cookie.
    </p>
<p>
     “This little game you’re playing,” Agatha accused. “I want you to tell Alice and Jen we were messing around, and that we are barely even friends.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would I do that?” Rio leaned back in her chair. “I’m having so much fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, there must be something you want.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond, instead she reached out and grabbed a photo frame sat on the desk. She turned it over to see it was a picture of Agatha and a boy with black curly hair grinning at the camera.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this your nephew?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snatched the frame back and put it in her desk draw. “Well? What is it? Do you want money? Do you want me to apologise for leaving?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope, but I wouldn’t say no to either.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what is it?” Agatha demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared Agatha down. “I want you to admit you never wrote the note.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?” Agatha shifted in her chair. “So you want me to lie?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I want you to tell the truth,” Rio countered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood from her chair. “So you want me to say that I did write the note.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I don’t!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’m confused.” Agatha began to slowly walk round the desk. “Because you want me to tell the truth, and you also want me to lie. So what do you actually want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop playing games,” Rio demanded, but soon found Agatha towering over her. She watched as the woman leaned down, bracing her hands on the arms of her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     “You started it, hun. I’m just finishing it. Now what I want you to do is call up your sister and tell her we were just messing around, and then I never want to see you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed. She could smell Agatha’s perfume again, and she couldn’t think properly. “And if I refuse?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then you’ll be hearing from my lawyers,” Agatha answered. “A cease and desist, or a good old defamation suit. I’ll let them decide, just as I’m letting you decide what you do. But don’t take too long. I’ll be calling my lawyer tomorrow morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     Shit, Shit. Shit. Rio barely had enough money to get through her degree, let alone pay for legal costs.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t file anything against me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “I can’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, because I haven’t done anything wrong, legally anyway, and besides…you don’t even know my last name!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed and moved away from her. “Vidal right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Shit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed a sticky note and a pen. “Is that spelt V-I-D-A-L?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled smugly. “I hate you more.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glowered at her, before surging forward and grabbing a load of cookies.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Agatha protested, but Rio was already running out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for the cookies,” she said to Sharon as she raced by.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anytime dear,” Sharon called after her. “See you again soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond, just ran through the office and back into the elevator. When the doors shut, she leaned against the wall, the cookies still clutched to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was certainly a piece of work.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Another dinner at the Kaplans. Billy had nagged enough that Rebecca had invited her round, and since it was Friday and she had no meetings after 3, Agatha decided to head out early. She pulled up just as Billy was walking in from school, and seeing the grin when he saw her was worth the mountain of emails that would be waiting for her Monday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     It was said smile that also led to her being slumped on the couch while Billy tapped away at her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, what do you want your name to be?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How about my name?” Agatha frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “No I mean like your handle.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just stared at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll make one up.” He bit his lip in thought before grinning. “Please say this isn’t taken.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” She leaned over to see what he was doing. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you are mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What does that even mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s shoulders slumped in defeat. “Okay let me think of another one….Oh!” He typed something before showing it to her. “What do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     She read it and grimaced. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well do you have any better ideas?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snatched the phone from him and tested a few names before finding one that fit. She handed the phone back to him. “There.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the first one I wrote?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am a mother,” she argued. “To Senõr Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “MotherHarkness it is then.” Billy grinned. “Now for a profile picture. Let me go through your photos…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly took the phone off him. “Why don’t you send over one of your photos of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy eyed her suspiciously before picking up his own phone and scrolling through his camera roll.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I like this one.” He showed her a picture of her leaning in the dining room doorway with one of her work suits on.
    </p>
<p>
     “When did you take that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A few weeks ago,” he admitted. “For snapchat.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you put me on snapchat?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only to Eddie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha decided to let it slide. She quite liked Billy’s boyfriend, though she had been reluctant to trust him with her nephew’s heart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, send it to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll send a selfie of us too,” he added. “For your first post. Do you want me to show you how?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I…”
    </p>
<p>
     A notification appeared at the stop:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      You have been added to the group: Double date!!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha moved the phone away, but she wasn’t quick enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going on a…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope,” she told him, before opening up the message. It was from an unrecognised number, but from looking at who else was in the group, she knew who it was.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Hi ladies so we’re thinking of going for a picnic tomorrow. Are you two free?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored the message. It seemed Rio hadn’t told her sister yet, and she was already drafting the email to her lawyer in her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now,” she said, opening up Instagram again. “Let’s post something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy stared at her for a moment before nodding and pointing out what she needed to do.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time dinner was ready, Agatha had a cute profile picture, a snappy bio and a cute selfie of her and her favourite (only) nephew. She had followed Billy, Rebecca, Jeff, Jen, and a few authors she liked. It actually didn’t appear as fickle as she thought it would be. In fact, she was so engrossed, she had it open at the dinner table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, we have a no phone policy,” Rebecca reminded her. “Put it away or it’s going in the kitchen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and put it on her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave her be, Mom,” Billy quickly jumped to her aid. “She’s only just discovered social media.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well she can discover it after dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her watch vibrated and Agatha tapped her phone, only to see it was a notification from that stupid group chat. She discarded her food again to open it, hoping it would be Rio saying no, saying they weren’t dating, ending this stupid game once and for all.
    </p>
<p>
     Nope, it was Jen.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      And another miracle- Agatha Harkness has joined ig
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A response popped up as she was reading.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Followed you Agatha!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her Instagram and, sure enough, Alice had followed her. After a moments contemplation, she followed her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha honestly!” Rebecca huffed. “What example are you setting for Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That rules are for suckers.”
    </p>
<p>
     While her nephew and brother-in-law tried to hide their amusement, her sister wasn’t at all tickled by her antics.
    </p>
<p>
     “No more phone!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tutted and began stabbing her food with her fork.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca put down her cutlery and knelt her elbows against the table. “So I was down the grocery store the other day…”
    </p>
<p>
     “News of the century,” Agatha sassed, before her wrist buzzed with another notification, then another.
    </p>
<p>
     “I bumped into someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Agatha tapped on her screen and saw two new notifications:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag has followed you
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag has commented on your post
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Great.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well aren’t you curious who it was?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really,” Agatha answered as she opened the comment under her and Billy’s selfie
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag: cuteness must run in the family 😉
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was going to kill her. Honestly, she was going to…
    </p>
<p>
     “It was Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s head snapped up. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She came to drop the kids off at Vis’s place  and decided to pick up some groceries. She asked about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could feel Billy watching her closely. Concerned. She put on her coldest mask.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I don’t care about her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She asked if you were seeing anyone,” Rebecca continued. “She said she’s not. So I told her you weren’t, and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true,” Billy interjected, causing all the adults to look at him in surprise. Especially Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you talking about, kid?” Agatha said with a nervous laugh. “I’m not seeing anyone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I’m not,” she insisted before looking back to her sister. “What did she say next?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She asked me to pass her new number on to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha started stabbing her food again. “I don’t want her number.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “She doesn’t want it because she’s seeing someone,” Billy accused. “I saw her phone. She’s going on a double date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are?” Rebecca questioned. “Since when?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t lie.” Billy glowered at her. “Why won’t you tell me? I tell you everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’m a grown up and I don’t have to do anything,” she shot back.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not a denial,” Jeff pointed out. Agatha angled her fork in his direction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is she?” Rebecca asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s no one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So there is someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and sat back in her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Wanda seems interested,” Rebecca added. “And I know things were messy there, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     Nope, nope. Absolutely not.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, Billy’s right. I am seeing someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it!” Billy grinned. “Who?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a deep breath. She couldn’t believe she was doing this.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What are you smiling at?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Rio insisted, but Lilia wasn’t convinced.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been smiling at that phone for 10 minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scoffed. “No I haven’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shifted in her spot on the couch and looked back to the TV. “Whoever she is, I’m guessing she’s pretty.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked back at the photo: a teenage boy grinning at the camera, with Agatha smiling beside him. The picture of radiance. She bit her lip to stop herself from grinning at the memory of that morning. Even the threat of a lawsuit, the way Agatha leaned over, the way her voice went deep with threat.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh she was enjoying this so much.
    </p>
<p>
     She just wished she could have seen Agatha’s face when she saw her comment. It served her right for having her profile on public.
    </p>
<p>
     She continued to stare at the image until a notification popped up. When she saw who it was from, she closed Instagram immediately.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA

</p>
<p>
<em>
      Have you spoke to Alice yet?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Still haven’t made my mind up…you gave me until the morning.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn’t a lie. Rio had spent most of the day trying to decide what to do. Though the thought of going to court against Agatha being an entertaining one, she knew the reality of it wouldn’t be so much fun.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Hold off on that. What’s your address?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She bolted upright.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong?” Lilia asked, but Rio ignored her as she hastily typed out her address. She got a reply almost instantly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Come meet me outside when I text you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio jumped to her feet and daryed towards her room. “I’m heading out for a while.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where?” Lilia questioned. “It’s getting late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, but I need to change.”
    </p>
<p>
     As adorable as she felt in her comfy pjs, she needed to look good for Agatha. To help with the manipulation, of course. She threw on some jeans and a black hoodie, and applied some light make up. Enough to look good, but not enough to make it obvious that she actually tried.
    </p>
<p>
     It took Agatha a while to arrive, and Rio spent most of the wait alternating between pacing the floor and checking she looked okay.
    </p>
<p>
     When she finally got the text, she all but ran out the apartment, ignoring Lilia’s shouts to slow down. She made it down to the street and spotted a car pulled up outside: a slick black Mercedes that shimmered in the glow of the streetlamps. Yep, definitely her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio climbed into the passenger seat and greeted Agatha with a wide smile. “You wanted to see me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Want is a stretch.” Agatha indicated to pull out and began driving down the street.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are we going?” Rio asked, not too worried that she was being driven her away into the night by a woman who openly hated her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nowhere,” Agatha answered. “I’ll take you back when we’re done talking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, then what do you want to talk about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Us. This stupid situation you’ve thrown us in. My nephew saw that damn group Alice made and now my family think we’re dating too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. She certainly hadn’t anticipated that!
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not funny!” Agatha snapped. “They want you to come round for dinner at some point.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s laugh grew louder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will you stop laughing!” Agatha snapped. “It’s not like I wanted this to happen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wiped a stary tear from her cheek. “You could have just told them the truth, you know, or come up with a better lie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stayed silent.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait a minute, you
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     them to think we’re dating.” Rio grinned wickedly. “Oh you little liar.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” Agatha snapped. “I didn’t have a choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed again. “Whatever you say.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So I’ll play your little game as long as you keep up the charade when my family is involved.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Does this mean I get to meet your beloved nephew?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is to be decided.” Agatha indicated to go down a side street, and they started heading back towards Rio’s building. “Accept the picnic invitation. We’ll take photos, play our parts, then in a few weeks, we’ll break up and I never want to see you again. Do you understand?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do I get out of this?” Rio questioned. “Besides getting to tease you as much as I want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what I want.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’ll text Alice right now, and you’ll have to deal with whatever it is you need a fake girlfriend for.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha huffed. “I’ll do what you want, but after we ‘break up’.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like a good deal to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha braked harshly outside Rio’s building. “I’ll pick you up tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What a gentleman,” Rio teased as she climbed out of the car. “See you then,
     <em>
      lover
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio shut the car door, Agatha sent the car hurtling off down the street.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked in the night air and smiled up at the starless sky. Cosmic karma definitely adored her.

<p>
     Rio shrugged on her denim jacket and admired herself in her bedroom mirror. Cute jeans, cute top, cute open shirt. Yep. She looked good.
    </p>
<p>
     Waving bye to Webbers, she walked out into the living area. Lilia was sat at the table with her cards.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look nice,” she commented. “So is this a date?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Rio confirmed with a grin. “A double date.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shuffled her cards. “Want a reading?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was about to answer when she got a message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Outside
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and moved to sit down in front of Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about reading of gifts?” the older woman suggested and Rio nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia lay three cards and turned the middle one. “This is your focal point.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was the Ace of Cups.
    </p>
<p>
     “Perhaps love, perhaps a fresh start,” Lilia explained. “Perhaps a combination of the two. Eitehr way, it suggests peace in oneself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got another text.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Hello??
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Now the gift to give.” Lilia turned over another card. Judgement. “Forgiveness of past mistakes.”
    </p>
<p>
     A sharp sound of a car horn cut through the quiet apartment. Rio smirked deviously.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned the last card as the beeping continued. “The gift to receive. The Lovers.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grimaced at that. “Seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia chuckled. “This card looks very on the nose, but…what the hell is that racket?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My date,” Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here then?” Lilia questioned. “Go to her!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waited until she heard Agatha hold down the horn in one continuous honk before getting up. “Right I’ll see you later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Behave yourself,” Lilia called after her, but Rio simply laughed and walked out of the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got outside, Agatha was still pressing the horn, and didn’t stop until Rio was sat in the passenger seat.
    </p>
<p>
     “So impatient,” Rio teased, earning a glare.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well now we’re late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re still 45 minutes early.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I have to get there,” Agatha reminded her, “and park, and pay for the parking, and find a spot to set up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice will be there already,” Rio assured. “She said she’s got the perfect layout planned.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. “This is one of worst day of my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are the others?” Rio asked, but Agatha ignored her and sped off down the street.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite trying to initiate conversation, Agatha gave her the silent treatment the rest of the way there, only acknowledging her as they were parking up.
    </p>
<p>
     “No weird stuff today,” she warned her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t help it,” Rio argued. “I’m a huge weirdo.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh I know,” Agatha assured. “I mean don’t act like you did at the bar.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio batted her eyelashes. “But you said I could tease you as much as I liked?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got out of the car and slammed the door behind her. Rio smirked and followed her out of the car, only to find her rummaging in the trunk.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled out a wicker picnic basket before shutting the trunk with another slam. “It’s a picnic, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved to peak at what was inside, but Agatha swatted her hand away and strutted off towards the park entrance. They spotted Alice and Jen already sat under a tree, Jen leaning against Alice’s side as Alice draped an arm around her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stole a look at Agatha before moving to take her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly pulled away from her. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Holding your hand. We’re dating, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that really necessary,” Agatha argued. “Jen knows I’m not into PDA.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But we need to be convincing!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled but grabbed her hand anyway. Her hand was warm and soft, and Rio shifted hers to lace their fingers together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very,” Rio answered, trying to ignore the way her heart was doing silly little Summersaults.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen sat up when she saw them, clearly surprised. “Agatha Harkness all loved up!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.” Agatha handed the basket to Alice. “I didn’t know what you already had.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Chips and dip, mostly,” Alice answered. “And some diet cokes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once she and Agatha sat down, Rio crawled forward to help Alice unpack the basket. Fresh pastries, finger sandwiches, those fancy bottles of water. She knew Agatha had a flashy lifestyle, but this was another level of fancy.
    </p>
<p>
     “So Agatha what do you do for work?” Alice asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I work in publishing,” Agatha answered. “What about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shrugged. “I bounce around a lot. My last job was working security at a department store, until I got fired.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew the story but enjoyed seeing Agatha’s reacting frown. “What? Did you tackle someone?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we had an event and I slept with the special guest.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s frown turned to a scandalized gasp. She looked to Jen. “Did you know this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen chuckled. “Yeah, I was there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…wait you met at that pop up event you did?”
    </p>
<p>
     “They more than met that day,” Rio added, and Alice kicked her foot.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rio. “You knew?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s my sister. We tell each other everything, sweetheart.
     <em>
      Everything
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a tight smile. “It’s a good thing we’re taking things slow then, honey. I don’t think your sister would be able to look me in the eye.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen cleared her throat. “Agatha come find a bathroom with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Now,” Jen said as she stood.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and patted Rio on the knee. “Excuse us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her go, her fingertips instinctively brushing the spot that still tingled from Agatha’s touch.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Alice laugh and looked to her, confused. “What’s so funny?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got it bad,” Alice teased.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like you and Jen aren’t sickening,” she argued. “And we’re still in the honeymoon phase. You guys have no excuse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice held up her hands in defence. “Okay, okay. It’s just nice to see you so happy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I guess I am,” Rio smiled. She was certainly enjoying herself, anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s smile morphed into a nervous expression. “I need to talk to you about something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please tell me you’re not proposing,” Rio half-joked. “You know I support a good U-Haul but that would be too quick.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice chuckled. “No, no. I decided to go to Mom’s storage locker.”
    </p>
<p>
     “By yourself.” Rio usually went with her once a year to look through what remained of Lorna Wu’s physical estate: a cube storage locker off the interstate. It was mostly her old 70s garb, some cool and others dated. They each had one of her iconic necklaces too: Alice’s had an orange hexagon pendant while Rio had a Stevie nicks style silver moon. Alice wore hers every day. Rio only wore hers when she could stomach it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to take Jen,” Alice admitted. “So she can get to see what Mom was like. I went looking for some photo albums to show her, but I ended up finding something else.”
    </p>
<p>
     “An unreleased album?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I found her diaries.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was even more priceless. “Have you read them?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A bit,” Alice answered. “It’s weird. She should have been the one telling me these stories.”
    </p>
<p>
     “In a way she is,” Rio pointed out. “I’m glad you’ve got that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice gave her a sad smile. “You can read them with me if you want. She was your mom too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When you’ve read them, maybe.” Rio didn’t want to impose. If she had anything like that of her mom, she would hold onto it for dear life.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does Agatha know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “About your mom or mine?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Either?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re having fun at the minute,” Rio explained truthfully. “It’s not time for serious the stuff yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. It seems serious if you’re planning on waiting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “We’re courting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked at her cynically. “Whatever you say.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Jen.” Agatha tried to keep up with her friend as she marched across the park. “Jen, the bathroom sign said the other way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to find the bathroom,” Jen huffed. “I’m so mad at you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mad?” Agatha questioned. “Why? What have I done now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen whirled round to face her. “What game are you playing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not playing any games,” Agatha lied. “What are you talking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen scoffed. “Oh please. Alice loves the thought of her sister being happy so much that she can’t see you’re messing with her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me?” Agatha questioned, her outrage for real this time. “I’ve done nothing wrong here. You wanted me and Rio to get along, and now we are. I honestly can’t believe this. I can’t win!”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen folded her arms. “So you genuinely have feelings for her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you promise?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise you that the feelings I have for Rio are genuine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Technically not a lie. She genuinely couldn’t stand her.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stared her down, but Agatha remind firm in her twisted truth. Eventually, Jen gave up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, but stop talking about your sex life with my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is all Rio, and we’ve not had sex yet anyway. And won’t for a while either.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Jen questioned. “This isn’t Downton Abbey.”
     <br/>
     ”Because we’re still getting to know each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed at that. “Okay, look I admire the intention but you and I both know that you two will be pretty much living together this time next week.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms. “We’ll see about that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s smile dropped. “It wasn’t a challenge.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held out her hand. “Three weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Winner wins the satisfaction of being right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shook her head in disbelief but accepted her hand anyway. “I think I might have a shot of winning this one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A bit too confident, aren’t we?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen walked past Agatha to head back towards their dates. “I’m telling you this time next week…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, just smiled smugly as they returned to the little picnic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey sweetheart.” Rio patted the space on the blanket beside her. “Come sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat and tried not to move when Rio shuffled to lean against her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t get into any trouble while I was gone l, did you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not at all,” Rio insisted. “I’m your little angel, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha genuine laughed at that. “More like my little devil.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen made a gagging sound. “Okay you two are gross.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha met Rio’s gaze and put on her best smile, trying to ignore the genuine pull on her lips when she saw the way Rio’s eyes sparkled.
    </p>
<p>
     It seemed they were actually quite convincing.

<div>
<p>
     Agatha knocked on the apartment door impatiently. Rio had said she wasn’t ready yet and told her to come up, meaning she had to put money in a meter and abandon her car in what was an unsavoury neighbourhood in comparison to her own. She swore if there was a single mark on that car when they got back down there, Rio would be paying for every penny.
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened and an older woman with grey curls and flamboyant clothing opened the door. The woman looked Agatha up and down before folding her arms. “You’re Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am, who are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio’s roommate.”
    </p>
<p>
     Of course she was. “Is she ready?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet, but you can wait in here.” The woman let Agatha inside before slamming the door behind her. “Take a seat at the table.”
     <br/>
     Agatha sat down, and the woman quickly moved to sit opposite her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know who you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I gathered,” Agatha sassed.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I think Rio is making a huge mistake giving you another chance.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Funny, my sister feels the same about her.” Agatha countered.
    </p>
<p>
     “You hurt her, and I’ll hurt you,” the woman threatened. “Do you understand me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Wha-”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said do. you. understand. me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha avoided the woman’s eyes, keeping her composure the best she could as she nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” The woman put on a sickly-sweet smile. “You can call me-”
    </p>
<p>
     “LILIA!” Rio’s voice boomed from an adjoining room. “IS THAT AGATHA?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, she’s here!” Lilia called back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Send her in!”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia waved for her to go. “Don’t keep her waiting any longer than you already have.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a spiteful smile before marching towards Rio’s room and opened the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s taking so…nope absolutely not!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Rio looked down at her outfit. “You said to wear a dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     The dress was black, tight, and whole she couldn’t actually see anything, it was obvious she wasn’t wearing a bra.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “If you don’t like this dress, you won’t like my other ones.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Where is that blouse you wore at the bar?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pointed to a mountain of crumpled clothes in the corner of the room. Agatha hadn’t noticed it before; the room was generally just a mess.
     <br/>
     “Well you can’t go like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared her down before smirking and picking a black jumper off her bed. “I wasn’t going to,” she said before pulling the jumper on. “Better?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio grinned. “Just let me touch up my make up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down on the bed and properly took in her surroundings. The room was very…earthly. Lots of real plants, fake plants, pictures of plants, books about plants- most of which were left open on a desk that was almost hidden by all the mess.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that your laptop?” Agatha stared at the dated machine sat amongst the mess. “It’s ancient.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not that old,” Rio dismissed. “And it works fine most of the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips and carried on studying the room, her eyes soon landing on a tank filled with greenery. In it, a small brown creature was climbing on a rock.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that your tarantula?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Webbers, yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Webbers,” Agatha repeated as she got up to get a closer look. “It’s quite fluffy, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s beautiful,” Rio said with pride. “Do you want to hold her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly moved away. “Not on your life.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s reflection grinned at her. “Is the great Agatha Harkness scared of spiders?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” she quickly insisted. “I just don’t like them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her mascara down and turned to face her. “What do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Dammit, Agatha thought, she was stupidly annoying beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’ll do,” she said dismissively. “You ready to go?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and held out her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on.” Rio wiggled her fingers. “Let’s get into character.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled but took her hand anyway. This was already a disaster, and they hadn’t even gotten to her sisters yet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s family lived in a boring-looking house on a boring street in a boring town in suburbia.
     <br/>
     All the lawns looked the same, and they all had the same types of cars and curtains, and Rio guessed every house had the same floor plan.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a good thing she was here to liven things up a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Agatha said as they walked up to the front door. “Don’t touch anything, don’t start with the weird flirting, and don’t antagonize anyone. Well besides my brother-in-law. He’s fair game.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Noted.” Rio was definitely not going to follow any of those rules.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t even have chance to knock before the door flew open, revealing a tall teenage with familiar black curls and a scar across his eyebrow. Agatha’s nephew.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re both here!” He grinned. “Come in, come in.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked in like she owned the place, and Rio tried to enter as confidently as she could. No matter how much she enjoyed messing with Agatha, she was a guest in someone else’s home, and she was raised with some manners at least.
    </p>
<p>
     The boy stood before her and held out his hand. “I’m Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and shook his hand firmly. “I’m Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so glad you agreed to come over,” he said enthusiastically. “Mostly so I can tell you some of my best Aunt Agatha stories.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waited for Agatha to sass the boy, but she didn’t, instead she ruffled his hair and walked further into the house. “Rebecca?”
    </p>
<p>
     “In here,” a voice replied down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy signalled for Rio to go ahead, and so she followed Agatha through into the kitchen. There, a brunette woman in a navy dress was stirring something in a large pot (from the smell, she guessed a tomato-based dish) and a man in a cheap suit leaned against the counter looking at his phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Both looked up when they noticed them, their eyes going from Agatha, then to Rio, then to Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, this is my sister, Rebecca, and my brother-in-law, Jeff,” Agatha introduced. “Guys, this is Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca abandoned stirring to walk towards them, stopping in front of Rio. She was pretty, Rio decided. She didn’t have the same powerfully sharp features as her sister. Her face was softer, lighter, while her deep brown eyes contrasted Agatha’s blue.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s so nice to meet you finally.” Rebecca’s smile was forced. That kind of sickly forced smile that middle-aged housewives seemed to find second nature. “I’m guessing you’ve already met Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, though I feel like I’ve met him ten times over,” Rio lied. “Agatha talks so much about him.”
    </p>
<p>
     She saw Billy smile and duck his head, while Agatha hid her face in embarrassment. Neither of the boy’s parents looked surprised though.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dinner will be ready soon,” Rebecca stated as she walked back to the stove. “Please, make yourself at home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Follow me!” Billy insisted. He led them through to a living area filled with ugly furniture and family photographs. A family home, Rio noted. She couldn’t even remember what one of those felt like.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gestured to the couch. “Please, sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Chill, kid,” Agatha told him, her signature curt tone softer than usual. She sat down and Rio followed, their legs touching as they settled on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy perched in an armchair. “Rio, Agatha told me you like poisonous plants.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wouldn’t have put it quite like that. “I find them interesting, yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you seen a belladonna in real life?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Seen one? I’ve held one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy stared at her in awe, while Agatha looked, dare she say, concerned. “Can’t that kill you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know what I’m doing,” Rio assured. “The leading cause of plant toxin deaths is ignorance.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure it’s the fact they’re literal poison,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re not having this debate now, Aggie.” Rio savoured the warning look Agatha gave her at the nickname. “I’m sure Billy has a list of things he wishes to discuss, and I him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Billy sat up in his chair. “Ask me anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at Agatha. “What is the most embarrassing thing your aunt has ever done?”
    </p>
<p>
     A mischievous smile appeared on Billy’s face, and Agatha was quick to point a warning finger at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you dare.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy was unaffected by the warning and looked to Rio with humour in his eyes. “She dressed as Senõr Scratcy last Halloween and ended up getting so drunk on my dad’s spiked punch that she decided it was a good idea to ride up and down the street on my bike. We found her and the bike in a hedge, fast asleep. My boyfriend had to help me carry her back because my dad had also drunk too much punch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t even want to know what he put in that,” Agatha commented, but Rio just laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please say you’ve got photos.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy went to get his phone out of his pocket, but Agatha held up her hand to stop him. “William Kaplan, if you humiliate me in front of my girlfriend, Eddie is finding out about the Thanksgiving incident.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gasped. “You wouldn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know I would.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s shoulders slumped and he put his phone away.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re no fun,” Rio playfully scolded, but Agatha just rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “So Rio,” Billy said again. “Are you from here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m from many places,” she answered. “My childhood was spent moving more than staying.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel Agatha studying her curiously, but it was Billy who spoke up. “Like where?”
    </p>
<p>
     “New York, LA, Miami, Las Vegas, Paris, Barcelona, London, even Sydney for a few months.”
    </p>
<p>
     Both aunt and nephew blinked at her in surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve lived, like, everywhere cool,” Billy commented. “Was it fun?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Some of it was but living in hotels and travelling here, there and everywhere can be tiring.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you move around so much?” Agatha asked, before catching herself. “I mean you told me you moved a lot, but that’s a
     <em>
      lot
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “For my step-mom’s work,” Rio answered. “The good thing about it was me and Alice had some great adventures.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca called them through for dinner soon after, with Jeff at the head of the table and Billy sitting opposite Agatha, Rio found herself opposite Rebecca. Their eyes met across the table, and she could see the little housewife mask slipping off to reveal a shadow of distain.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca definitely hated her.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff luckily was oblivious and began to yapper on about his car as they tucked into to ridiculously good spaghetti and meatballs.
    </p>
<p>
     “The mechanic told me it would take more than the car was worth to get the bump out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not get a new car?” Billy suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I like the car I have,” Jeff answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then get the same car?” Rebecca suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I like
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     car.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pay to fix it then,” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “But they said it’s a waste of money.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio but her lip as not to jump in. Though Agatha had given her the green light, she knew Rebecca wouldn’t take it well if she antagonised her husband.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you get a second opinion?” She said instead. “That way, you might have options.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or you could live with the bump,” Agatha added. “That way you’ll always remember to turn when you see the shiny M.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “He bumped it in the McDonald’s drive through,” Agatha explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh. so it’s not just a bump, it’s a McBump.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy laughed, and she could see Agatha pushing down a smirk. Jeff looked like he was used to being the butt of the joke, but Rebecca glowered at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Yep, definite hatred there.
    </p>
<p>
     “How does it feel meeting the family?” Jeff asked. “Probably about as strange as it is for us.”
     <br/>
     Rebecca elbowed him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What, Agatha has never brought anyone for dinner since…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her knife in a dagger stance. “Wanna finish that, Kaplan?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed at their antics. “It’s nice seeing you all. It’s like seeing a bit of her origins.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a superhero,” Agatha sassed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was thinking more supervillain, but whatever.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stabbed one of the meatballs with her knife.
    </p>
<p>
     “Has Agatha met any of your family?” Billy asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s met all my family.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I haven’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you have,” Rio insisted. “Alice, Lilia, and Webbers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Webbers?” Billy piped up again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her tarantula,” Agatha answered, and the boy’s eyes grew in awe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you held it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s too chicken,” Rio answered. “She’s the cutest little thing, too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s no surprise,” Rebecca spoke up. “She’s terrified of spiders.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it!” Rio grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks sis,” Agatha grumbled. “I’m never going to hear the end of this when we get back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re never hearing the end of this ever!”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you have no other family?” Rebecca asked, and Rio shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m grateful for what I have.” She reached out and toughed Agatha’s shoulder. “And now I’ve met this one, I have more than I could ever ask for.”
    </p>
<p>
     She felt Agatha stiffen for a moment under her touch, but she didn’t move away. Instead, she watched Agatha lift her own hand up, caressing her own delicately. Rio tried hard not to pull away as her touch tingled her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy then decided that was the moment to ask if he could go see a concert in the city with his boyfriend, which caused his parents to argue and eventually suggested they take it to the kitchen. It seemed that the change of venue only made them louder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you have to ask that then?” Agatha scolded her nephew, who glowered back at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought they’d be cooler about it in front of a guest.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows. “How bratty.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t call him that,” Agatha huffed before glaring at Billy. “Brat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy bowed his head in shame. “They don’t let me do anything. I want to be able to do things for myself. Everyone else gets to do cool stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not 16 yet,” Agatha argued. “You might have to compromise with them on this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to compromise everything. You know that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave him a sympathetic smile. “I know, but it won’t be forever.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked between them. There was a story behind this, she was sure what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy then put on a smile for Rio. “Do you like music?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Doesn’t everyone?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I show you my record collection?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Agatha, who nodded. “I would love to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy led them upstairs to his room. But it wasn’t a room. It was like walking into his mind. Not a surface was left without a trinket, not a wall left without a poster. Even his floor was covered in stuff, from the various shirts that had been thrown in every corner, to the guitar propped up against a set of draws.
    </p>
<p>
     “I keep my records here.” Billy pulled out a big metal case from the side of his bed. “I need better storage.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to clean,” Agatha criticised. “I don’t know whose room is worse, yours or Rio’s.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Messiness is a sign of greatness,” Billy sassed back. “Right Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was only half listening. Instead, she stood in front of one of the many posters, staring up at a face that made her eyes sting with tears.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay, hun?” Agatha asked, moving to stand next to her. If Rio didn’t know any better, she would say she was worried. Agatha Harkness was a great actress, after all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” she assured, not looking away from the poster.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you like it?” Billy asked. “I got it at a yard sale. I screamed when I saw it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tore her eyes away from the poster to look at him. “You like Lorna Wu?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like?” Billy laughed. “I love her. Agatha bought me her album and I listened to it over and over for weeks. I’m guessing you’re a fan too?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Kind of,” Rio answered. “She was my step-mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     The room went quiet. She had managed to startle Agatha and chirpy mini me into silence, which she took as an achievement. It didn’t last long though; Billy found his voice quickly enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you know this?” he asked Agatha, who shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I…Wait so Alice is Lorna Wu’s daughter?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How did I not know this?” Agatha questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “You never asked,” Rio answered. “And it’s not something you really bring up. Like ‘hey, sexy lady, my step-mom was a rockstar and she died with my dad in a hotel fire’ doesn’t have a seductive ring to it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just stared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry.” Billy moved forward and engulfed her in a hug. Rio awkwardly patted him on the back and forced a smile when he pulled away.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a long time ago,” she assured. “And no one’s life is perfect.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Billy looked to Agatha, who had started picking up the clothes scattered on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to go tell your parents that I’ll be on standby while you’re at this concert,” she announced. “I’ll be right back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha march out of the room with a ball of her nephew’s shirts clutched to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “She doesn’t do emotions very well,” Billy said once Agatha’s footsteps had faded. He sat down on the edge of the bed and Rio sat herself in his desk chair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry for going heavy there, kid. I just didn’t expect to see her here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it,” he assured. “And I’m glad you shared it with us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are?”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded. “I think you two are good together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded again. “You have more in common than you think.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned and was about to respond when Agatha’s voice summoned them from downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy stood and smiled down at her. “Come on. I think my mom made pie for dessert.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stole one last glance up at her step-mother before following Billy downstairs. Back to Agatha, and back to the performance.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Luckily Rebbeca and Jeff had been argued out when she suggested her compromise, and after a quick dessert, she announced her and Rio’s departure.
    </p>
<p>
     The drive back was a quiet one. Agatha didn’t talk much anyway, but usually Rio was chattering away in an attempt to get a rise out of her. Instead, she just stared out of the window.
    </p>
<p>
     They were near the edge of the city when Agatha decided enough was enough. “I didn’t know you were her step-daughter, you know that right? If I had, I would have…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed weakly. “Agatha Harkness has a heart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know what it’s like losing a parent,” Agatha told her. “Mine and Rebecca’s dad died when Billy was a baby. It was horrible. I can’t imagine what it was like losing two at once.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t reply. She stared out of the window some more, and just as Agatha was about to ask if she was okay, she finally pipped up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are they so protective of Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s grip tightened on the steering wheel. “He…there was an accident. He got hurt. It was bad. He’s fine now, but he wasn’t for a while. It scared us all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I understand,” Rio assured. “He reminds me of you, you know?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but smile. “I’m the lesbian aunt and he’s the gay nephew. We’re a sitcom waiting to happen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s more than that,” Rio insisted. “I can’t explain it. He’s like you but, I don’t know, hopeful?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to stay neutral. “He’s a lot better than me.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed in a more comfortable silence until they pulled up outside of Rio’s apartment building.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for not being too weird,” Agatha relented. “Though you did push it a few times.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I had to make it fun, didn’t I?” Rio smirked. “So, I guess I’ll see you next time Alice and Jen text?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I guess.” Agatha watched Rio push the passenger door open and climb out. “What are you doing tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked back at her, surprised. “I have to be at the college until three, but after that I’m free as a bird.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you meet me somewhere at four? I’ll send you the address.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head with suspicion. “Is this an elaborate plan to murder me, Ms Harkness? Because I will tell you now, I’m a skilled poisoner.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You wish, weirdo. No, I want to take you shopping.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shopping?” Rio questioned. “You’re sugar-babying me now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?! No! I wouldn’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax,” Rio stopped her, “I was kidding. Text me the address and I’ll be there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked once more. “What can I say, I want my prize.”
    </p>
<p>
     She gave Agatha a little wave before shutting the door and striding into the building. Agatha watched long after she had disappeared from view and leaned back in her seat.
    </p>
<p>
     This was the worst idea she’d ever had.

<p>
     The address Agatha had sent her was a posh department store with a red carpet and a doorman. A doorman that was currently looking Rio up and down with suspicion as she loitered outside, her hand holding onto the strap of her college backpack.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m waiting for someone,” she told him. “I’m early because she’s usually early.”
    </p>
<p>
     The doorman just continued to stare at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually she saw Agatha marching towards her in yet another power suit (black this time).
     <br/>
     “Sorry, I got held up in a meeting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay. I was early.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her watch and frowned. “Yes, you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to the doorman again. “This is her.”
    </p>
<p>
     The doorman tipped his hat to Agatha. “Ms Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Norm,” Agatha acknowledged as he held the door open for her. “This is Rio, my partner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows. That was a new one.
    </p>
<p>
     She offered Norm a smile when he tipped his hat to her and followed Agatha inside.
     <br/>
     The place was all marble and gold and shimmer. Even the air smelled fancy, but she knew Agatha would at her laugh if she said that. It was all too fancy; she didn’t like it at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha led her over to a section of women’s clothes towards the back of the store. “Right, pick some stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pick some clothes you like.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “I thought we could get you a new outfit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned and folded her arms. “What’s wrong with the clothes I have?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Agatha said, too high pitched to be truthful. “I just…you know what, it doesn’t matter. Let’s leave.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, what were you going to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to suggest we meet Jen and Alice somewhere nice for dinner and I just thought we could make an entrance, you know. See the look on their faces when we walk in like a…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a power couple?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I thought it would be funny, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “My colour is green,” Rio told her. “And black.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Agatha moved down the rail. “We’ll get looking. And don’t worry. It’s my treat.”
     <br/>
     It was all expensive, Rio knew. Clothes someone like her was only meant to look at not wear.
     <br/>
     She tried a few things. A black suit, a sage jumpsuit. Each time she came out of the changing room and did a little twirl for Agatha, enjoying the way she looked her up and down. Every time she said Rio looked good, but Rio wanted more. She wanted a reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     As she pulled on her favourite ensemble so far, she wondered if it would feel more exciting if they really were ‘partners’. Would Agatha’s eyes openly appraise her? Would she reach out to touch her? Would she whisper her most sinful thoughts into her ear? Or would she praise, worship, gaze upon her like a moral in the presence of a goddess and be ready to fulfil her every desire?
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps the Rio a year ago had the chance of finding out the answer. The best this Rio could hope for was making her gay panic. And so she stepped out of the changing room in her best outfit yet: a buttoned-up dark green waist coat and matching trousers. No shirt, no bra.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was sat in the waiting armchair on her phone. She stole a glance at her, looked back at her phone, only to stiffen before looking up again. Rio tried hard not to grin as Agatha stared, her blue eyes wide and her mouth fell slightly open.
    </p>
<p>
     Gay panic indeed.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” Rio turned and made sure to stop with her body angled to one side, ensuring she got a good glimpse of side-boob.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cleared her throat and got to her feet. “I think that’s the one we should go with, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “If you say so.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked her up and down one more time before nodding. “I’ll meet you at the counter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her rush off and laughed to herself. Oh she was going to enjoy this outfit so much.
    </p>
<p>
     She made quick work in changing and carried her new favourite clothes to the counter. Agatha was pacing in front of a very nervous shop clerk.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m here,” Rio announced and placed the suit in front of the clerk. “I think that’s a winner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, just watched the clerk fold the suit up into tissue paper and carefully place them in a bag. With a wave of an American Express card, it was all theirs. Agatha pushed the bag towards Rio, who took it with a grin. She swung it on her fingers as they exited the store, saying goodbye to Norm as they stepped back onto the street.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio said. “I can pay you back, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you see the price tag?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. She had looked, but there wasn’t one there.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Agatha continued, “don’t worry about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio played with the strap of her backpack. “So I guess I better head back to campus.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “You said you were done with classes by three?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but Lilia has invited her psychic circle over for dinner, and they get a little too giddy when the wine gets opened. I usually don’t mind, but I have work I need to get done, so the library it is.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have no more meetings today, but I still need to finish some work at the office. You could work there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a study date?” Rio teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “If you don’t want to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no. I want to. I hate the library.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “You really are full of surprises, aren’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Oh you have no idea.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s laptop was loud. Too loud. It had taken ten minutes just to load up, and now she was tapping away on it so harshly that Agatha could barely concentrate on her own typing. Maybe they were sat too close. Rio was literally sat on the other side of her desk. Still, that didn’t account for the ridiculously useless machine Rio was working with.
    </p>
<p>
     In the end, she’d had enough.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed one on her phone. “Sharon, can you get one of the IT guys up here please.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure thing, sweet cheeks!”
    </p>
<p>
     The loud tapping stopped. “Is your laptop okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mine is fine,” Agatha answered. “Yours sounds like it’s about to take flight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Rio insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “No it’s not. Save what you’re doing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Save it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So bossy,” Rio grumbled but appeared to do as she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     With a knock on the door, Phil the IT guy (and his stupid moustache) walked in. “Can I help you, Ms Harkness?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, do we still have the laptops we fazed out last month?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We do,” he confirmed. “All ready to donate to the young writers program.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent. Clear your schedule for the afternoon.” She hit to her feet and leaned across the desk to snatch Rio’s laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio protested, but Agatha ignored her and handed the laptop over to Phil.
    </p>
<p>
     “Copy everything on here onto one of those laptops. Make sure everything is on there, but don’t snoop. Any problems, you’re fired.”
    </p>
<p>
     Phil took the laptop and fled the room, leaving them alone once more.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you I like my laptop,” Rio argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll get it back,” Agatha promised. “You’ll just get a new one too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t take a laptop off the young writers whatever.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There are like 200 of them. And anyway, just make sure if you ever want to publish one of your poison books, we’re your first choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and started rummaging full her bag. She pulled out what looked like a manuscript of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha returned to her desk and completed the email she was working on, stealing glances every so often to where Rio had moved to one of the sofas.  Whatever it was she was reading had set a deep frown on her face. She had a red pen in her hand and was chewing lightly on the end of it.
    </p>
<p>
     For some reason, it was very distracting.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t know why she had even suggested this, though she didn’t know why she suggested taking her shopping either. She couldn’t stand Rio. Just looking at her face made her want to scream, but she couldn’t keep away. A glutton for punishment, she guessed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned off her laptop and picked a manuscript up from her desk. Contemplating for a moment, she stood up and brought her own manuscript and pen to the sofas. Sitting at the opposite end, she began flipping through the pages.
    </p>
<p>
     She saw Rio peaking over at her. “What you reading?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A manuscript, you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My latest report towards my thesis.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s it about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This report or my thesis?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Either or?” Agatha answered. She was sure she wouldn’t understand it, but she was still curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well this report is about a study I recently took part in about azalea samples that recently put a woman in a coma, and my thesis is related to how easy plant-related toxins can be accidentally ingested.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cheery stuff then?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “What’s yours about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s about a guy who wants to be a pianist but can’t because blah, blah, blah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her work down in her lap. “You’re not enjoying it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been told I’m a harsh critic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped dramatically. “
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     , really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared back. “You would be too if you had a whole team dedicated to bringing you the best work and all I get is this crap.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chewed on her pen again. “Are you good at checking grammar and stuff?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was an editor in a past life,” Agatha answered. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked up her report and threw it in the space between them. “Let’s swap.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you check that my writing isn’t totally shit, I’ll tell you if you’re being a harsh critic or not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I don’t know anything about plants,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh the information is fine,” Rio said with confidence. “I just want to make sure it structurally makes sense.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah thought for a moment, Really, she shouldn’t be sharing submissions with anyone, but it wouldn’t be the full thing, and Rio wasn’t an industry spy. She was just a pain in her ass. So she threw it in the middle and they each grabbed their respective works.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flipped through the pages. “Why are the corners all ripped?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Senõr Scratchy has a taste for paper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed and found herself Agatha laughing with her.
    </p>
<p>
     They worked in comfortable silence, the only interruption being when Sharon told them it was time they ate some dinner. Agatha asked her to order some pizza and that she could head home. She needed to finish Rio’s report, and they had to wait for Phil to bring the laptop back anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     The report was interesting. Some parts went over her head, but she followed most of it. Rio wrote well overall. Some mistakes here and there, and some parts Agatha annotated with suggested structural changes, but it was actually a compelling read.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she was done, they had devoured most of the pizza and Rio was on her second can of coke. She closed it and placed it between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up at her in surprise. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “I left some comments, but it’s good work. What about you? What’s your thoughts?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed the manuscript with a slap before handing it over. “You were right. It’s pretentious crap.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you.” Agatha drew a dismissive line across the front cover. “That will be going in my reject pile. Probably one of the directors will push it for publishing though. Sometimes I swear I’m surrounded by idiots.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Am I one of your idiots?”
    </p>
<p>
     Annoyingly, Rio was too clever for her own good.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a pain in my ass.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her, and Agatha had the overwhelming need to bite down on her lip. Admittedly, she had been a bit edgy since the changing room. That suit, or more what the suit didn’t cover, was engrained on her brain. God, she wanted to be repulsed by her, truly, but she just couldn’t be. It would be like looking at the stars and denying their glimmer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted closer to her. “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I…”
    </p>
<p>
     A knock at the door made them both jump, and they both looked to see Phil cautiously enter carrying two laptops. “All done.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Rio jumped up and took the laptops, her heartbeat racing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked over the new laptop and grinned. “This is amazing! Thanks dude.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, thank you Phil,” Agatha spoke up. “Please, head on home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Phil nodded and quickly retreated.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is so cool,” Rio grinned. “Honestly, Agatha, thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Agatha dismissed as she headed back over to her desk. “You best be heading on home now. I still have some work I need to get done here, but it’s getting late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right. Yeah. Okay.” Rio began gathering her things. “So will I see you tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m quite busy,” Agatha replied. “I’ll talk to Jen about dinner, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Rio moved to stand in front of her desk. “Thanks again. Not just for the clothes and the laptop, but for letting me stay. I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Agatha insisted as she pretended to do work. “Let me know when you’re home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will.” Rio didn’t move though, just stayed routed to the spot. “So I guess I’ll see you soon?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a forced smile and a nod. She kept her head down after that, ignoring the disapproving click of Rio’s tongue, the retreating footsteps, the slight creek of the door.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only at the sound of the door slamming shut that Agatha gave up the charade. Letting out a heavy breath, she slumped in her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     Just over two weeks, she told herself. Two more weeks and Rio Vidal would be out of her life (and mind) for good.

<p>
     It had been two days. Two days of radio silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t called. Hadn’t texted. Nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t posted on Instagram either, but an Agatha update had come in the form of Billy sending her a follow request. His profile was public, so she scrolled through out of curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Most of his posts were of him and his boyfriend, and of his parents. There was still plenty with Agatha though. Mostly selfies with captions like:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      aunt of the year
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      check out my cool aunt
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      when your mom’s sister is also your bestie
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Cringe but cute.
    </p>
<p>
     What really drew her to the photos was the way Agatha smiled in every single one. The way she looked so happy. The way she goddamn glowed. If she ever saw her like that in real life, Rio was sure would simply combust.
    </p>
<p>
     Her favourite post though was one that didn’t have many likes. It was a bad photo with bad lighting, at some kind of party it seemed. Part of it was burred, and she couldn’t really see their faces, but it didn’t matter. Billy and Agatha were hugging each other in a tight embrace, spontaneous and candid.
    </p>
<p>
     The caption read
     <em>
      : bad photo but she’s the best person in the world (sorry mom and dad). she was the first person i came out to in my family and she gave me the confidence to be openly myself. she’s my greatest role model and the person who showed me that loving who you love is never wrong. i love you aunt agatha and i always will

     Rio had been looking at the post for a fifth time when she got a notification from the double date group chat.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      ALICE

</p>
<p>
<em>

<p>

</p>
<p>
     Rio grinned to herself. “Three, two, one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s name flashed up on her caller ID. Rio waited five rings before answering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Are you going on a date?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “How is that any of your business?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Because if you are, I can fake dump you with cause.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio laughed bitterly. “Oh no, Agatha. You aren’t getting out of this so easily.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What are you doing then?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Webbers and I planned to have a girl’s night.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Well your spider…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Tarantula.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Whatever. I really don’t care. Just put on the group chat that you were joking.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio thought for a moment. “Okay, I’ll do it.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Good.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “If…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh for fuck sake what now?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. She loved the sound of her swearing, even if it was in exasperation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Add me on Instagram.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “No.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re my girlfriend. It’s weird that we’re not following each other. Your nephew sent me a request this morning.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Did you accept?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I wanted to ask you first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed.
     <em>
      “Let me follow you, then accept him, but block him once we’re over. I’ll tell him I asked you to.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Honesty for once, Rio thought bitterly. Of course she would be for the boy.
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal. I’ll await your follow request.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hung up the phone and a few moments later, a follow request popped up. Rio smirked. She was definitely at the top of her searches. She accepted Agatha, then Billy, and followed Billy back for good measure.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening up the group chat again, she typed her reply.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      RIO
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay, I’ve been persuaded. Gives me an excuse to show off the new outfit Agatha bought me!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      JEN
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      You’re buying her clothes now Harkness?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      What can I say? I have a fantastic eye for fashion.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked over at her wardrobe and smiled wickedly. Oh Agatha really walked into that one.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Ava’s was the happy medium between casual and fancy. Enough for her to dress up in a black jumpsuit with a silver chain and feel neither under or over-dressed. Jen was in her usual pinks, and Alice had put on a black shirt and tie under her usual leathers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, however, was late.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’ll have been talking with Lilia,” Alice assured when Agatha checked her phone for the two dozenth time. “My sister has no concept of time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t I know it,” Agatha huffed as she typed out a text.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      AGATHA
     </b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Where the hell are you??
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why are you buying that girl clothes?” Jen questioned. “Can’t she get her own stuff?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just wanted to treat her,” Agatha answered defensively. “Don’t you buy Alice anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     The pair looked at each other and blushed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. “Okay, I don’t want to know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes. “Please, like I don’t know about that box…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jennifer Kale, if you finish that sentence I will ruin you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’ll ruin her and not me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes. Of course Rio had to show up at that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, sis. That’s an interesting outfit,” Alice commented, and Agatha looked to see the pair who were staring behind her in shock. At least it wasn’t just her then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you like it,” Agatha grinned as she moved to turn in her chair. “I think she looks…”
    </p>
<p>
     She too found herself in a state of shock.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t wearing the outfit. In fact, it was neither a suit nor was it green. No it was a skin tight brown dress that dipped low enough to show a sinful amount of cleavage. But that wasn’t what had her staring. No, the dress wasn’t just tight. It was sheer, and Agatha could see everything. From her black panties to the obvious visual that she had no bra on.
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her, she heard Jen laugh. “Now I see where the generosity came from.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips and turned back to Jen. “She’s beautiful, isn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed a hand on her shoulder as she glided into the seat beside her. “Thank you, my darling.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at her with daggers, but Rio just smiled back.
    </p>
<p>
     They were back to games? Fine, let’s play.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ordered a bottle of wine and two glasses, pouring one for herself and one for Rio. She pushed it towards her before dropping her hand to touch Rio’s forearm, stroking her thumb against the soft skin. She saw Rio swallow and reach for her wine with her free hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “I refuse to believe you two haven’t done anything more than kiss,” Jen commented, earning a light shove off her girlfriend. “Come on, look at them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited until Rio took a sip of her drink before replying. “Don’t worry, Jen. That box under my bed will definitely be getting some action soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio spat her wine back into her glass and wiped her mouth. Agatha resisted smiling and painted a look of concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay, honey?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Oh I’m fine. You know, I think we should invite your sister to one of these girls’ nights. I’m sure she’d love to hear all this girl talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh you have a sister?” Alice asked with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Half sister,” Agatha clarified. “But sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh we need to meet.” Alice was full of an innocent giddiness that even she had to admit was quite endearing. “Maybe while Jen is away on her work trip.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When are you going away?” Agatha asked. “You never told me about this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, I didn’t know I had to run my diary through you,” Jen sassed. “And in two weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Two weeks. Her and Rio would be over by then.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll see if she’s free,” Rio answered. “I think Billy will want to meet you though. Turns out he’s a big fan of Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Rio a warning look. Rebecca was one thing, but bringing Billy into this was a step too far.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh that’s amazing!” Alice grinned. “Does he like merch? I can get him some merch? I’ll go tomorrow and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe,” Jen stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right. Sorry.” Alice looked to Agatha sincerely. “Seriously, though. I love that he’s listened to her music. It’s like a whole new generation is getting to know her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded in understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was Agatha who introduced her to him,” Rio added as she brought her wine glass back towards her lips. “Seems like she’s a fan too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I took Rebecca to one of her concerts when we were teenagers,” Agatha answered simply. “It was a good time.”
    </p>
<p>
     She noticed Rio quickly put her glass down. “You saw her. Like, in real life?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Third row from the front.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gawped at her before looking to Alice, who just smiled in amazement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Rio, this is like something out of a movie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fought the urge to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. There had been upwards of eight hundred people there. It wasn’t that much of a surprise, just a coincidence.
    </p>
<p>
     The waiter came over to get their dinner orders. He was young, probably not much older than Billy, but he was old enough to spend the entire time staring at Rio’s chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen gave their orders, either not noticing the boy’s wandering eyes or not caring. Agatha couldn’t help but notice, and she didn’t like it one bit.
    </p>
<p>
     She said her order coldly, before turning to Rio and putting a hand on her thigh. “What do you want, baby?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her hand over hers and squeezed. “The lasagne please, my sweet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked back at the waiter and raised a challenging eyebrow. “She’d like the lasagne.”
    </p>
<p>
     The waiter quickly scribbled down the order before scurrying off. Agatha watched him go, only to freeze when Rio’s breathe suddenly tickled her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jealousy looks sexy on you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled her hand away from Rio’s and got to her feet. “Will you excuse me a moment?”
    </p>
<p>
     Making her way through the restaurant, she found sanctuary in the bathroom. She checked the stalls were empty before leaning over the sink and clenching her eyes shut. She needed to calm down. She needed to stop biting. Rio was just playing games. That’s all Rio did. She was cruel, manipulative…
    </p>
<p>
     The bathroom door opened, and Agatha didn’t even have to look up. She knew exactly who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just checking on my girlfriend,” Rio purred.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at the mirror and saw Rio’s reflection approaching hers. Soon, she felt the warmth of her pressed against her back, and she watched as a hand gently brushed her hair off her shoulder and to one side.
    </p>
<p>
     “You seemed pretty tense out there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio trailed a finger down the curve of her neck. “Stop what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jerked her head away from her touch. “Why are you wearing that? The suit cost me over a day’s wages.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh I’m saving it, my dear. I like this dress, and I thought you’d appreciate it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this because I didn’t call?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s laugh vibrated through her as she felt a hand move to caress her hip. “Maybe at first, but you showed your hand tonight, Agatha. I saw the way you looked at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t look at you in any way.” Agatha fought to keep her voice steady, but then she felt Rio’s breath tickle her neck and she had to bite down on her lip as not to react.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know the human body.” Rio’s finger trailed the side of her jaw. “I know how it reacts. I saw how your pupils dilated, how your breathing became strained.” Agatha felt her press two fingers against her pulse point. “Heart racing. Oh my darling, you’re burning with desire.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped the sink tighter. “Shut up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The great Agatha Harkness,” Rio teased. “Nothing more than a pathetic mess over little old me.”
    </p>
<p>
     That did it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whirled round and backed Rio up against the wall. She could tell by her eyes that Rio was surprised, and that made her smile all the more wickedly. She leaned forward, their cheeks brushing as her lips reached Rio’s ear. “Are you sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     She felt Rio shiver and pulled back to see her handywork. Rio’s cheeks were flushed, her eyes wide and darkened. Agatha pressed up against her until their noses were a mere breath apart. Her hands found their way to Rio’s waist, and she felt the other woman angle her hips instinctively forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “You call me pathetic? You think I don’t see the way you react when I touch you? If I’m burning with desire, you’re ablaze with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her for a moment, her breathing heavy. Then, she grinned widely. “So you do want me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha yanked herself away from her. That was the last straw. “We’re done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile dropped. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell Alice and Jen what you want. Tell everyone what you want. I don’t care. I never want to see your face again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped away from the wall. “We had a deal. You promised me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not giving you anything,” Agatha moved to the bathroom door. “You’ve taken enough of me already.”
    </p>
<p>
     She left Rio behind, leaving the bathroom and weaving her way back to her table. Her excuse was non-existent, just informing Jen and Alice of her departure, and she ignoring Jen’s calls after her as she walked towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t look back to Jen, didn’t look back to Alice, didn’t look back to see if Rio was following. She just stepped out into the street.
    </p>
<p>
     Away from it all.
    </p>
<p>
     Away from her.

<p>
     Rio lay across her bed, her arms propping her up so she could marvel at the figure approaching her. She licked her lips. “You’re a vision, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Even in just a bra and panties, Agatha was commanding. Confident. It made the warmth between her legs all the more desperate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha climbed onto the bed and kneeled before her. “You’re a work of art.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like the Mona Lisa?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha started to climb up her. “More like the dirty drawings I had in the back of my 10th grade geometry book.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled. “That’s very specific.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laid down on top of her, and Rio instinctively wrapped her arms around her waist from below, hugging her close. She watched Agatha smile as she leaned in.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been in my head all my life, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes, ready to finally feel Agatha’s lips…
    </p>
<p>
     “RIO! WHERE’S MY SPATULA?”
    </p>
<p>
     She groaned and forced one eye open. She was still in her bed, but now she was alone, daylight streaming in through the window, and Lilia was banging around in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “NEVERMIND. I’VE FOUND IT!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio buried her face in the pillow, desperately trying to catch the last images of her dream, but they were out of her reach. Instead, she had the memories of the night before to plague her heart and mind.
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to go after Agatha but had made it to the doors in time to see a taxi pulling off from the curb. Jen and Alice had questions, well Alice had questions while Jen demanded to know what she had done. In the end, she left them to their date and ate Lilia’s leftover lasagne before heading to bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Reaching to her nightstand, she checked her phone. A couple of ‘are you okay’ messages from Alice, but nothing more.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening her chat with Agatha, she typed out a message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Can we talk?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She debated sending it, hoping Agatha would have calmed down and that their ridiculous little plan would be back on. But Agatha’s voice echoed in her mind.
     <em>
      “We’re done.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t want to be done. She pushed too far, she will admit that, but that wasn’t any reason for this to be over. For them to be over.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned onto her back and stared up at the ceiling. Why the fuck did she do that? Why did she have to wear that stupid dress and ruin it all? There would have been better ways to bring Agatha back after she pushed away. They’d still had about a week left of their deal. She would have gotten her admission, and maybe even an apology. Maybe that would have been enough for her to walk away. Closure for a year of turmoil. This wasn’t. This just made her chest feel hollow.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled herself out of bed and headed out to see what Lilia was up to. Surprisingly, the blender was away, and her roommate was plating up some pancakes.
    </p>
<p>
     “She rises!” Lilia teased. “No classes today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going,” Rio announced as she slumped onto the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?” Lilia turned to look at her. “Are you ill?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio answered. “I got dumped.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha dumped you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia tossed the spatula into the sink with a clang. “That bitch! How dare she do that to you again?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Lilia. It was my fault. I was joking around and went too far.” She didn’t want to tell her older roommate they were a few choice words away from having hate sex in a public bathroom. “I mean, sure I may have pushed too far, but I thought that was our thing. I didn’t expect her to react like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio folded her arms. “What do you mean ‘ah’?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia sighed. “Rio, don’t take this the wrong way but you have a tendency to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Antagonize.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared back at her in disbelief. “When have I even antagonized anyone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia laughed. “Oh, come on. For the first month we lived together, I thought I’d let a serial killer move in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t that bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You put ice down my back when I was cooking, you always jumped out at me if I came home after you, you even put your spider in my hair.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Tarantula,” Rio corrected.
    </p>
<p>
     “And Alice must have nerves of steal because whenever I see her, you’re playing some kind of trick.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sisters do that,” Rio argued. “It’s normal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, what about the time that guy was trying to talk to her at that bar we went to, and you chased him around the place cackling like a witch?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, he was making her uncomfortable and I had to step in,” Rio defended herself once again. “And I’d had a few glasses of wine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia chuckled and shook her head. “The point is you were nervous about us living together, but even through your…uniqueness, I could tell you liked me enough, and I know you love Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do, but what does this have to do with Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe the reason you’ve antagonized Agatha too much is because you really like her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know about that,” Rio admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re dating her,” Lilia reminded her. “You wouldn’t be if you didn’t like her.”
    </p>
<p>
     If only Lilia knew the full story, Rio thought bitterly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess,” she shrugged. “We argue a lot, and sometimes she’s a total bitch. Then, sometimes, we just…we have these moments. We just click, and I don’t understand it. I hate her and I…”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia raised her eyebrows. “You what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “Doesn’t matter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you talked to her since last night?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia picked up the plates of pancakes. “Call her, message her, or do whatever you kids do. Then come back here, eat your pancakes, and think about how you’re going to get her back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed her suspiciously. “But you don’t even like Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t,” Lilia agreed. “But for whatever reason, you do and that’s all that matters.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio jumped up and headed back to her room. Picking up her phone, she looked at the message she had left unsent.
    </p>
<p>
     Taking a deep a deep breath, she pressed send.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had been waiting for the elevator when she got the message. She had a nine o’clock meeting with a literary agency across town and was about to spend an hour doing some catch up before her meeting with the execs.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d thought it was Billy when her watch buzzed, they’d been talking about his impending concert, so had opened it without thinking.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Can we talk?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a shaky breath. She hadn’t slept much the night before, plagued by images of deep brown eyes, a see-through dress, and a wicked smile.
    </p>
<p>
     She had no doubt she’d made the right decision. Whatever it was she and Rio were doing would have always ended badly, and this way she could just get on with trying to forget about her. Still, she could shake a lingering sadness when she thought of her.
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator doors open and she climbed aboard. Pressing the number for her floor, she waited until the doors were closed before looking at the message again.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew talking was healthy. The school therapist her dad made her see after she finally moved in with him had said it like a mantra. A lot of her youth had been spent hiding herself, and by extension her voice. Since then, Agatha had never shied away from making herself heard, especially to those who didn’t want to hear it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was different, though. Rio could stand toe to toe with her. Rio could trip her up without her noticing until it was too late. Rio could make her so vulnerable and take the opportunity to rip her heart. And most of all, Rio was a liar.
    </p>
<p>
     She also happened to be the one person Agatha had ever felt truly herself with, even if those moments had been fleeting.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she had made up her mind, and that was that.
    </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>
      No I meant what I said. We’re done with this.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha made it to her office, dumped her bag by her desk and slumped in her chair. She opened her emails and saw a reminder about the upcoming company function and two attached tickets. She hated those things, but usually she took Jen and they would cause some trouble. This year, Jen would be too busy following Alice like a lovesick puppy. Maybe she could bring Rebecca, or take one of their top authors. That would look good, she guessed.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone buzzed again.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Please just hear me out
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha jabbed back a reply.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I don’t want to hear it.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She put her phone down on her desk and returned back to her emails, only to soon find herself picking it up again.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening up Instagram, she searched up Rio’s profile and began scrolling through. Most of it was pictures of plants, all captioned with their Latin names and any other anecdotes she had. There were pictures of her tarantula, of course, and of Alice and Lilia. The photos Agatha stopped on were the ones of Rio, some of her pretending to be moody or scary, some goofy, and others the picture of radiance.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was beyond denying Rio was beautiful. How could she? If she was a painting, she’d replace the Mona Lisa. If she was a film star, she would be on every screen and magazine the world over. Instead, she was a pain in the ass PhD student who was brilliant and totally infuriating. And she just so happened to drop herself in the middle of Agatha’s life like a goddamn grenade.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t realise she had been staring so long until a knock on her office door made her jump.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come in,” she called.
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened and Sharon pocked her head in. “Your meeting is in 5, honey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, yes, thanks,” Agatha dismissed her with a wave. When Sharon shut the door, she stole one last look at her phone before putting it away and gathering her things.
    </p>
<p>
     The executives were two floors up, and she ended up stuck in the elevator with an intern that looked like was going to combust out of nerves. Agatha chose to ignore her and pushed by her when the doors opened.
    </p>
<p>
     Her watched buzzed with a text- this time from Rebecca.
    </p>

    </p>
<p>
     The conference room was already busy when she got there, filled with loud men and women who were trying to put their foot in. Agatha refused to associate with any of them and sat down in the far corner.
    </p>
<p>
     She checked her phone quickly as the executives began to file in, only to quickly regret it.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>

     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Just give me 10 minutes please
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha put her phone away. It wasn’t even midday, and she needed a drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Before we start,” one of the execs, Mike, began. “I wanted to let you know about a recent acquisition we are in the process of negotiating.”
    </p>
<p>
     An impressed murmur rumbled around the room. Agatha rolled her eyes. What had they decided to do now?
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re delighted to announce that we are in talks with none other than Maximoff Productions.”
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio lay on her bed, still in her Pyjamas and eating from a bag of skittles. She was scrolling through her socials, trying to distract herself, but it wasn’t working. Agatha hadn’t replied to her last text, and she had a sinking feeling that was that. Any more would be bordering on harassment, and she didn’t want to do that. If Agatha didn’t want to speak to her, she’d have to accept that was that.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened Instagram and saw Billy had posted. It was a selfie of him and his boyfriend with school lockers visible behind them. The caption read:
     <em>
      so grateful for my teenage romance.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That boy needed to stop with the sickly-sweet captions, or she’d get a cavity. Still, she liked the post anyway and continued scrolling until a message popped up.
    </p>
<p>

     She froze. What should she do? Agatha wouldn’t want her talking to him, but she couldn’t leave the kid on read.

</p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a sigh of relief. That looked to be the end of that. She had moved to Pinterest and was in the middle of adding photos to her deadly nightshade board when she got another message.
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn it, kid,” she grumbled but opened it anyway.
    </p>
<p>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She had many questions.
    </p>
<p>
     First off, what meal? Had Agatha neglected to tell her about it? Wasn’t the whole point of this to put on a show for her family? Or did she have other motivations Rio didn’t know about?
    </p>
<p>
     She tried not to think of the other part. Agatha was a good actor, and the kid just wanted to see her happy. (Maybe she wanted to see Agatha’s happy glow for herself too, even if she hated her lies.)
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she had an idea. Opening up the message, she typed back a reply.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
<br/>
<em>
      Thanks kid see you when I see you
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Right, she decided. Let’s do this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I just don’t understand,” Agatha argued as they walked away from the conference room. “Why do we need in-house illustrators.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They won’t be in-house,” Mike insisted. “Just under our umbrella.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, that’s the same thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you so concerned?” He questioned. “It won’t affect your role at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just think it’s a waste of time,” she lied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well the rest of us disagree,” Mike stated. “It’ll be good. You’ll see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched him head off to his office while she waited for the elevator. How could this even be happening?
    </p>
<p>
     She ran through her options in her mind: leave, hijack, or stay. All of which sounded equally as bad as each other. Maybe it was time to set up that indie publishing house she always wanted. even if the pay would be less, and more work, and maybe she’d need to get a smaller apartment.
     <br/>
     Still, anything beat having to see Wanda Maximoff’s face every day.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped into the elevator when it arrived and dared to check her phone. No messages from Billy, no messages from Rebecca, and more importantly, none from Rio. She should be relieved about that last one, but it just made her mood even worse.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she arrived at her floor, she stormed through the office, ignoring the ducking heads and the bodies diving out of her path. When she saw Sharon loitering by her office door, she groaned. Could her day get any worse?
    </p>
<p>
     “What now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have a visitor,” Sharon said with a smile that was somehow giddier than usual.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it urgent?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d say so,” Sharon answered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled under her breath as she pushed the door open.  She walked into her office with her head held high. Whoever it was that had decided to visit her without an appointment had some nerve, but she was the picture of professionalism.…until she saw who was leaning against her desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, her day could indeed get worse.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled back at her, two coffees in hand. “Hi.”

<p>
     Two things were apparent to Rio when Agatha walked in the door: First (and the most obvious), she was so hot in her work clothes. And second, she looked stressed as hell. Then, when she saw Rio, she was shocked. She stared back at her for a few moments, before her brow set in a frown.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I brought coffee.” Rio held up the two iced coffees for emphasis. “I got you this because I didn’t know how long you would be and, well, this can’t get cold. You know, because it’s already cold.”
    </p>
<p>
     She mentally kicked herself. Why the hell was she rambling?
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want it,” Agatha said dismissively. “Give it to Sharon on your way out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not…” Rio sighed. “It doesn’t have to mean anything. You’ve bought me coffee twice, and lots of other stuff too which I wish I could pay you back for but it would likely take me like two years if I was lucky. So this is me making us the tiniest bit even. And it’s also an apology. You know, for…the bathroom thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her again before abandoning her bag on the floor and flopping onto the couch. Rio stayed by the desk, still clutching the coffee cups. What the hell just happened? Had she just broken Agatha Harkness?
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Agatha shift to sit up. “Are you actually going to sit down then?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked across the room and sat at the other end of the couch. She handed Agatha one of the coffees and watched her bring the straw to her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah took a long sip and looked at it in surprise. “That’s actually not bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asked cautiously. “You seem a little…frazzled.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at that. “Only a little?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’re not okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s laugh died. “No Rio I am not in the slightest bit okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because of me or…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not totally but yes. You are one of the common denominators.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bowed her head. Though she expected it, hearing Agatha say it still stung. “I’m sorry. I was an ass, and I didn’t mean for any of it to go this far. Last night, or any of it. I was just so angry…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes. “I know. I was angry too. But last night was a step too far, Rio. You seriously crossed a line.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well maybe it was a line that needed crossing?” Rio challenged.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked away from her and sipped her coffee. It seemed that was not a conversation she was willing to have, so Rio tried something else.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your nephew messaged me on Instagram.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s head snapped up to look at her. “What did he say?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got out her phone and opened the app. Pulling up the chat, she handed the phone over for her to read. “Sorry, I felt bad leaving him on read.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say sorry so much,” Agatha commented as she squinted at the screen. “Your text is so small.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can read it to you,” Rio offered, but Agatha just got up and headed across the room. She picked something up from her desk and walk back over.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched in awe as Agatha unfolded the item with the help of her teeth and pushed them onto her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “No comment,” Agatha warned her as she sat back down. “This is a recent development.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, I’ll keep my thoughts to myself,” Rio promised. Though her comments would definitely be complementary. Agatha looked unbelievably sexy in glasses, especially thick rimmed glasses that sat so comfortably on her nose.  She admired this new look as Agatha read through the messages.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for telling him to get off his phone,” Agatha said as she handed Rio’s back. “He knows not to that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t tell him I told you. I feel bad about it already.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned again. “Why would you feel bad about it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it was private for him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I won’t,” Agatha promised. “I have a list of problems as long as my arm and I don’t need this adding to it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a sip of her drink. “What are your other problems? Well, besides me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not telling you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you said we were done. I’m a stranger to you now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows, and Rio realised the ridiculousness of that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, but still. I’m all ears.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slouched in her seat and took another sip from her straw. “That meal Billy mentioned is for Jeff’s birthday and both he and Billy want you to come.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “And we’re done.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll come to Jeff’s meal. I’m not an asshole.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It wouldn’t be a good idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Like any of this has been a good one?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at her drink. “I don’t like lying.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to point out the irony, but it wasn’t the right time to have
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     argument again. “It hasn’t all been a lie. We act the same around other people as we do when we’re together, just with a few pet names thrown in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A lie is a lie no matter how you sugar-coat it,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we’ve both accused the other of being a liar,” Rio reminded her bluntly. “And everyone else doesn’t know, so what’s the problem? Have you grown a conscience or something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t reply and took a sip from her coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “So is that the problem? Look, cards on the table, I want to carry on. It’s been nice not having everyone think I’m some unlovable weirdo, and I know you’ve had as much fun antagonizing me as I do you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled weakly. “It has been a little bit, but that isn’t the point.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what is?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward and put her cup on the coffee table, before putting her head in her hands. “I feel like my life is falling apart today. The aftermath of last night, this stupid meal, and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “And?” Rio prompted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her head, her eyes fixing on the view outside the window. She stared at it for a while, and Rio was about to ask if she was okay when she finally spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “I found out that my ex…best friend might be joining the company.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t stupid. She heard that pause, and it made her stomach twist into a knot. “On a scale of Billy to me, how much do you hate her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips. “I don’t know. I kind of hate you both, but I can…Wanda is different.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clenched her jaw. She definitely hated this Wanda with every fibre of her being.
    </p>
<p>
     “I haven’t seen her for a while,” Agatha continued. “She has a family now, her own business, everything. Me, I have…”
    </p>
<p>
     “An awesome job, a cool family, and an incredibly sexy fake girlfriend,” Rio finished for her. “And a kick-ass rabbit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed weakly before clearing her throat. “Rio, we can’t do this anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it’s crazy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You still need me for something,” Rio reminded her. “And I still need something out of you. So what will it be? Want to make your ex ‘best friend’ jealous and impress your family with your awesome girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha faltered for a moment, and Rio could practically see the thoughts dancing behind her eyes. She tried not to get her hopes up. Honestly, she had expected Agatha to throw the coffee over her, so even to get to this point was beyond her wildest expectations.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and was about to speak when Agatha held up a hand to stop her.
    </p>
<p>
     “On one condition.”
    </p>
<p>
     At that point, Rio would do almost anything. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t talk about last night again. Everything that was said needs to stay there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “You mean about…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, about that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ignoring it isn’t going to make it go away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I think it would complicate things more than they need to be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew she was right, and that she shouldn’t want to revisit what would obviously be a bad idea, but taking it off the table entirely didn’t make her entirely happy. Even so, it was a price she was willing to pay to keep Agatha a little longer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, deal.” She held out her hand and Agatha shook it. Rio savoured the touch and tried to stop herself from wondering what the warmth of her hand would feel against her cheek, on the small of her back, holding her with the rest of their bodies intertwined.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she definitely wasn’t thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what are you going to do for the rest of the day?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m going to text my sister, and I’m going to skim read my emails.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t Sharon do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I guess she could, but I don’t feel like reading crappy manuscripts right now, and all the talk in the office will be about the merger and I really don’t want to think about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     The merger. Wanda. Rio tucked that information away for later.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come play hooky with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “I can’t do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m needed here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked around the office. “Doesn’t seem like it to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on,” Rio pleaded. “You’re stressed and need the afternoon. You work your ass off here. If there’s an emergency, get Sharon to call.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to consider it as she sipped for of her coffee. “What do you have in mind?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Now that would be telling.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m not going down there,” Agatha announced as they stood by the subway steps.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. Why not?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness did not take the subway.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll get us a taxi,” she announced, but Rio just walked down the steps. “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You get a taxi. I’m getting the subway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked out onto the street, ready to do just that, then realised she had no clue where they were going, with a huff, she went down the stairs. Rio got her a ticket (Agatha refused to touch anything) and they headed to the platform they needed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop being a snob,” Rio snapped. “Have you seriously never ridden the subway before?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not since I stopped fetching people coffee,” Agatha clapped back. “It makes me claustrophobic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would you be claustrophobic?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because we’re under the fucking ground,” Agatha answered. “And we’re about to be squished into a tiny tin can with a load of total strangers. And I’m pretty sure I just saw a rat.”
    </p>
<p>
     She hated the damn subway.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Rio assured. “I got you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to stop the roof caving in and crushing us to death?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When has that every happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “First time for everything.” Agatha looked up at the ceiling with uncertainty. All that weight above and they were stuck in a void below. It was simple physics to her.
    </p>
<p>
     The train arrived quicker than she expected, and she followed Rio aboard, who pushed through and secured them too seats. Agatha tried to keep herself calm, but as the doors slid shut, and the train began to hurtle forward, she began to feel the telltale symptoms of panic.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried all the techniques she had learnt: close your eyes, steady your breaths, tell yourself it’ll be okay, and picture your happy place.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s first happy place had been her grandmother’s house, then her dad’s. Then as she got older, her happy place stopped being an actual place, but a person. It had been her grandmother, Rebecca, her first girlfriend, her college roommate (who became her second girlfriend), her dad. Then, from the moment he had been born, it had been Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     She pictured him, his curly hair, his wide smile, his moonstone eyes, the scar through his left eyebrow…
    </p>
<p>
     The train jolted and her mind reared left.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of beeping monitors filled her ears, the sound of Rebecca’s sobs as Jeff tried to comfort her through his own tears, the rhythmic sound of the machine that was making the chest of Billy’s lifeless body rise and fall. His eyes closed, skin pale, a bandage above his eye, a tube in his mouth as wires and IVs spread from his body like tree roots. And there was nothing she could do, nothing she could say. Her nephew, the light of her life, slipping away…
    </p>
<p>
     Something touched her hand, and suddenly Agatha was back on the train.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Rio laced their fingers together and squeezed. “You’re okay. You’re going to be okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squeezed back and sucked in a deep breath. “Can we get off at the next stop?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we can get a cab,” Rio promised. “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hid her face into Rio’s shoulder. She smelt like jasmine, washing detergent, and a scent that was just Rio. Closing her eyes, she focused on that until they reached the next station.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio helped her up and guided her off the train, never letting go of her hand. In any other circumstances, Agatha would have yanked her hand away. She’d barely put up with the handholding for appearances sake. It was unnecessary and impractical. Yet as Rio led back up to the world above, it was the one thing that kept Agatha grounded.
    </p>
<p>
     When they made it back out into the open air, Agatha pulled her hand away and shoved it into her coat pocket as Rio got them a cab. She watched as Rio spoke to the driver, before opening the back door for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “M’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, trying hard not to smile as she climbed in.
    </p>
<p>
     They spent the ride in a comfortable silence, both of them watching the city roll by, until the taxi pulled up outside of a park entrance. Rio went to pay, but Agatha flashed her American Express card before she could.
    </p>
<p>
     “That thing should be a registered weapon,” Rio commented, and Agatha laughed as she climbed out of the cab.
    </p>
<p>
     “So where are we going?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This way.” Rio walked a step ahead of her, and Agatha followed her down the street. Rio led her through the park. It was a decent enough day, not particularly hot but sunny enough. People were walking dogs, kids were playing, couples were talking arm in arm. She stole a look at Rio and wondered if she should do that too, then remembered they were by themselves. No point in making a show for no one.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon a building came into view, and suddenly it all made sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ta dah!” Rio held up her arms to frame the glass structure before them. “Welcome to the botanical gardens.”
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, Rio had a membership. Agatha should have known. Rio was a crazy plant girl after all. She did have a guest pass too, which meant she didn’t have to fast-swipe her credit card again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio led them to the glass conservatory building, her face like a child at Christmas (or Hanukkah as she now celebrated in the Kaplan household).
    </p>
<p>
     “This is where you come to unwind?” she asked as they stepped inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “This and playing basketball,” Rio answered, “but I thought this would be more up your street.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I came out in my teens. Of course I tried out for girls’ basketball.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you get on the team?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at the memory. “I did, but it didn’t last long.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How come?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I broke someone’s nose.”
    </p>
<p>
     “By accident?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a look and Rio nodded in understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     “Noted. No basketball for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “In my defence, she had thrown my girlfriend on the floor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, totally justified. Kind of.”
    </p>
<p>
     They started to walk round. Well, Agatha was walking, while Rio was jumping from plant to plant. Of course she knew every name, knew where they originated from, and what they could be used for. A lot of it didn’t make sense to her, but she listened to Rio anyway. The way she spoke so passionately was enough to keep her interested.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love coming here during the holiday train show,” Rio insisted. “And the orchid show. It’s divine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Divine,” Agatha repeated. “You know, I’ve never been here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I had a feeling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “You don’t have a very nature vibe, but we will work on that. Come over here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio led her outside and into vast gardens. Soon, they found themselves surrounded by roses of all sizes and colours, and Agatha honestly felt like she was in a children’s book.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you read the Secret Garden?” she asked Rio, who was studying one of the rose bushes with fascination.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, my mom used to read it to me,” Rio answered, her voice suddenly heavy. “Not Lorna, but my actual mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t thought or Rio having another mom. Logically, she had to have one, but she never mentioned it and every family was different. Still, the weight in her voice told Agatha there was something else there.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mom wouldn’t read to me,” Agatha admitted. “She said I had to learn for myself, so my grandmother taught me when she could. I spent most of my time at elementary school behind everyone else, so I tried to read as much as I could to catch up. I didn’t get to read the Secret Garden until I was in middle school.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her, and Agatha’s stomach dropped. Had she actually just told her that?
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you enjoy it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The book,” Rio clarified. “Did you enjoy it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Enjoy it? I read it over and over. I would dream about it. A secret place where I could run and play and be myself. It’s all I ever wanted.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at that. “I used to think that too. Go somewhere tucked away where the outside world couldn’t get in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha smiled sadly at the thought, before her eyes appraised her surroundings once more. “I wish I’d have come here as a kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I went to Kokedera in Kyoto as a kid, and it was unbelievable.” She could see the memories in Rio’s eyes as they glistened in awe. “Alice and I went with our parents. The gardens were unbelievable. I couldn’t believe somewhere could be so beautiful. We say so many beautiful gardens all around the world, but that was just magical.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that when you became interested in plants?” Agatha asked. “
    </p>
<p>
     “No, that happened before,” Rio answered. “One of my other favourite gardens is the poison garden at Alnwick Castle. It’s right on the boarder between Scotland and England. Alice and I went on a trip there one summer. She wanted to see the Harry Potter stuff and I went for the plants.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? So it’s like a garden full of plants that could kill you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, there’s a huge list of warnings before you go in. It’s so cool.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to admit, that did sound interesting. She watched Rio reach down and touch one of the roses.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re coming out bloom,” she commented. “Still beautiful though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Perfection is overrated.”
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned down to sniff the flower.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stay there,” Rio told her, and Agatha panicked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it poisonous?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, silly.” Rio pulled out her phone. “It’s a photo-worthy moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha instinct was to be difficult for the sake of it, but she had to admit she was having a good time, and a photographic reminder wouldn’t be too bad. So she moved back towards the flower, savoured it’s scent, before looking up at Rio with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “That any good?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A work of art,” Rio said with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, now I need one of you to be fair,” Agatha argued. “Pick a rose.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or we could take a selfie?” Rio suggested. “We don’t have one picture together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t?” Agatha frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay then.” She pulled out her phone and set up the front camera. Rio leaned against her, their cheeks pressing together, and Agatha tried her best to calm the jolt in her heart enough so she could get the right angle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfect.” She said after a couple of photos.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought perfection was overrated?” Rio teased, and Agatha playfully swatted her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     They walked round, took photos and chatted, mostly about plants, but also their interests. It turned out Rio was quite the basketball player, and maybe would have gone professional if she hadn’t spent her childhood on a tour bus, followed by a bad ACL injury in college that put the nail in the coffin. Agatha told her how she’d gone to college with the plan study law but ended up being an English major minoring in performing arts. Rio wanted to see videos of her performances, and Agatha assured her that would never
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     be happening.
    </p>
<p>
     They were about to head for a coffee when Sharon called. Mike had requested she deal with a situation that had the children’s fiction department at loggerheads, which in translation meant he wanted her to go scare the life out of them and make the final decision of what to do.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, they left the gardens, and Rio helped her wave down a cab.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to come with?” Agatha asked, but Rio shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to stay and talk to some people I know who work here,” she said. “I saw a few of them watching us, so I might as well get the twenty questions over with.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah?” Agatha said with a teasing smile. “And what are you going to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to say?” Rio threw back.
    </p>
<p>
     “No point in not sticking to our usual story, is there?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “My thoughts exactly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right well, I’ll talk to you later?” Agatah asked, trying not to sound too hopeful.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh you can count on it.” Rio then began to step back towards the garden’s entrance. “See you soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “See you soon,” Agatha repeated, trying hard not to giggle when Rio winked at her, and tried to push down her sadness as she watched her walk away.
    </p>
<p>
     Back at the office, the argument happened to be whether to request a plot change in the latest book of their most successful middle-grade series. After some discussion, Agatha said she would look at the data and told them to focus on the upcoming launch of their latest release in the meantime.
    </p>
<p>
     She walked out with Sharon around five and dropped her off at the station before driving home. She cooked some pasta and ate it alone as always (technically not though as Senõr Scratchy was also enjoying his nightly feed with an extra leaf of lettuce) and switched on the news, only to quickly tune in to a quiz show instead.
    </p>
<p>
     When she’d finished eating, she settled herself on the couch with a book from an author how’d ended their contract with their former publisher. Mike was eager to speak with their agent, but Agatha wasn’t convinced. Senõr Scratchy was also craving attention, so she had him on his mat on the floor, her free hand calmly stroking his fur.
    </p>
<p>
     One hour, eight chapters, a re-caged rabbit, and a glass of wine later, she received an Instagram notification.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag has tagged you in a post.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned and opened up the post.
    </p>
<p>
     There were three pictures, all of her. One of her smelling the rose, another from when she looked up to Rio, and another of her laughing as they walked through the conservatory. She had to admit, she did look good. And happy, despite the day’s events. What really made her smile though was the caption.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      The most beautiful flower in the garden (the rose is okay too I guess)
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha liked the post and was about to comment when she had a better idea.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t posted anything since Billy set up her account, but she pretty much knew what to do. She chose one of the selfies they’d taken and a few most of the gardens and of Rio standing by sculptures. Satisfied with her selection, she wrote a quick caption:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      The perfect date with my crazy flower girl
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She smiled to herself and tagged Rio before posting it.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy liked it first, within seconds, and commented soon after.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      @billlykaplann: you two are so cute!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen liked it soon after, and a few others: some work colleagues and old school friends that had found and followed her. Even Sharon commented a little heart in the comments, but none of that mattered. There was one person she was waiting on, and they were taking sweet time to check their phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to return to her book, but she was too impatient to concentrate. She felt like a teenage girl waiting for her crush to call, which was definitely not what this was. Not at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Then,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     , two notifications popped up.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag liked your post
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      @poisonhag commented: Anything for you, my love
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned and liked the comment. My love. That was a new one.
    </p>
<p>
     She was about to reach for her book again when she had an incoming call. Seeing who it was, she bit down on her lip as her thumb eagerly answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hey,”
     </em>
     Rio repeated.
     <em>
      “Can you send me the selfie. Like the non-cropped version.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Sure.” Agatha put her on speaker phone before manoeuvring through her phone to send the image. “There. It should come through soon.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Thanks,”
     </em>
     Rio answered
     <em>
      . “I’m setting it as my lock screen. Is that okay?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, sure, if you want.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “At the minute it’s just a photo of some plants so, you know, I thought it would be good for appearances. You can get away with it, because yours is Billy, but…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio, you can set your lock screen as whatever you want. And how do you know mine has Billy on it?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’ve seen it.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “When?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ignored her.
     <em>
      “Did you have fun today?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Considering we fake broke up, I found out Wanda is probably going to be working with me, and I had a panic attack on the subway, I actually had a great time.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah, it’s a great place, and the company wasn’t half bad either,”
     </em>
     Rio teased, before her vice became more serious.
     <em>
      “Did you get your work emergency sorted?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but it wasn’t an emergency, but I’ve ended up in charge of a decision I’m not too happy about making.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What kind of decision?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha took off her glasses and put them on her coffee table. With a tap, she took Rio off speaker and brought her phone back to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have this bestselling book about some middle schoolers who find this secret world. It’s getting turned into a movie, and it’s one of our flagship series. Well, the author submitted their draft for the latest book and they’ve had the main character fall in love with her best friend, who is also a girl.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Aw baby gays. That’s adorable.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well everyone is fine with it, but they’re worried it’ll affect how the book sells, and whether the series gets blacklisted by schools and libraries. I think Mike sent me down to make the decision because I’m the token lesbian, but I don’t know what to do. This could cause a lot of backlash and we could lose money, but I don’t know if I can deny some kid the experience of seeing themselves in a book for the first time. If that had been me at twelve, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped. She wasn’t even going to go there.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I get it,”
     </em>
     Rio answered. “
     <em>
      Have you read the other books in the series?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I was an editor on the first two.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “So ask for a copy of the manuscript and give it a read. You can’t make a decision on something you haven’t actually read.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “That’s true.” Agatha thought for a moment. “Then I can justify my decision too.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Exactly.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Thanks Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hey, I’m not just a pretty face.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled to herself. It was a very pretty face though.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hey Agatha?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Rio moving around on the other end of the call.
     <em>
      “You know early when we agreed we wouldn’t, you know…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha should have known this was coming. “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “No, I’m not arguing it,”
     </em>
     Rio insisted.
     <em>
      “I was just wondering if you wanted to, maybe, go on a fake date with me?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “A fake date?” She tried not to sound too surprised.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah, just dinner or something. You know, to make things more believable.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at that. “Well, we definitely need to be believable.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Most definitely,”
     </em>
     Rio teased.
     <em>
      “How about tomorrow?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart slumped. “I can’t tomorrow. Billy has his concert, and I promised I’d be available just in case.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh yeah, of course.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She could tell Rio was disappointed, and she was a little bit too. “Why don’t you come over? We could order some food and chat.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a long pause.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or we could do it another night?” Agatha backtracked. “We could go…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “No, tomorrow at your place sounds good,”
     </em>
     Rio insisted.
     <em>
      “What time do you want me?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Anytime. All the time. She quickly put those thoughts in line. “Say seven-ish? Do you remember…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah, I do,”
     </em>
     Rio answered quickly.
     <em>
      “So I’ll see you then. I’ll bring dessert.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You don’t…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha, please let me spend money for once.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay. So, seven?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Seven,”
     </em>
     Rio confirmed.
     <em>
      “See you tomorrow.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “See you tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Bye.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Bye.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Bye.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Bye.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “….Agatha hang up the phone.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled.
     <em>
      “Fine, but next time you are.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The call ended and Agatha bit back a grin. It hadn’t been a totally bad day in the end. Not at all.

<p>
      hi! thanks for all the comments! they really make me smile! this was meant to be half a chapter but got out of hand, so here we are!

<p>
     Her apartment was spotless, her kitchen was stocked with drinks and snacks, and she had changed into her best figure-hugging black pants and a low-neck blouse. Still, Agatha was panicking
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t know why. It was just Rio, and they were only getting take-out. And it wasn’t like Rio had never been there before, though last time they had ended up in bed together having straddled, kissed and caressed. That wouldn’t be happening again, but the memory of what almost happened weighed heavily in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed the buzzer at five to seven. With a smirk, Agatha spoke through the intercom app on her phone: “Hello?”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Let me up, m’lady. I have dessert!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and pressed the button to let her in. She paced the living room, wondering how long it usually took to get up there in the elevator. What if she forgot what floor she was on and got lost? Or if she couldn’t remember which was her apartment. She was sure the republican lobbyist on the floor above would love a chaotic lesbian knocking on his door asking for her. The thought made her smirk, but it worried her, nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon enough, there was a knock. It turns out, Rio remembered exactly where she lived.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a deep breath as she walked over to the door and opened it with a welcoming smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood there, dressed in an oversized grey button up and jeans. It was a simple look, but the way she smiled made Agatha’s heart so jumpy that she had to grip the door frame as not to embarrass herself. Rio’s hands were behind her back, and she titled her head, a cheeky gleam in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you know, most cakes are round because in ancient cultures they represent the sun and moon?” Rio brought a small carboard cakebox out from behind her back. “This one is square though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and stepped aside to let her in, shutting the door behind her. She watched Rio look around the apartment with familiarity as she moved to put the cake box in the kitchen. No sooner had the box touched the counter top did Rio make a swift b-line across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well haven’t you got big!” She leaned in so she and Senõr Scratchy were practically nose to nose through the bars of the cage. “How is the bestest rabbit in all the world?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked over and picked Senõr Scratchy out of his cage. “You remember Rio, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     She handed him into Rio’s waiting arms, and he was quickly nestled into a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “He does remember me!” Rio grinned. “He’s such a good boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course he is.” Agatha leaned in to kiss his head. “He’s my little ball of peanut butter, aren’t you my sweet boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel Rio staring at her and placed one last kiss to his head before standing up straight.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” she asked when she met her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Rio said softly, and it was then Agatha became aware of how close they were now stood. How instinctively she had moved into Rio’s space without even realising. Like it was natural.
    </p>
<p>
     Clearing her throat, she stepped back. “What do you fancy for dinner?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you want,” Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought for a moment. “Pizza?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfect,” Rio grinned as she rocked Senõr Scratchy in her arms. “Can we get a plain cheese?”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as we can also get a pepperoni?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ordered the food, then walked back over to Rio, who carefully handed over the rabbit.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s cuter than I remember.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that’s why he gets away with nibbling the corner of every book I read.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, you’re lucky,” Rio told the rabbit in Agatha’s arms. “These book nerds are very fussy about their untarnished corners.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a nerd,” Agatha huffed, making Rio laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, and I’m not a crazy flower girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hid her smile from Rio echoing her Instagram caption by kissing Senõr Scratchy’s head again. She put him back in the cage.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what do you want to do until the food gets here?” Agatha asked. “We could watch a movie or something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Movie sounds good,” Rio answered. “A horror?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “Most definitely.”
    </p>
<p>
     After some debate (because of course there would be), they settled on watching
     <em>
      Smile
     </em>
     . Rio of course found it hilarious, which in turn made Agatha laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     They both jumped when the pizza arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused the movie while Agatha went to answer the door, returning wit two pizza boxes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish you’d let me pay for something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You paid for dessert,” Agatha reminded her, and Rio pouted but didn’t argue.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put the boxes down on the coffee table and walked to the kitchen. “What do you want to drink?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we eating here?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked back at Rio, who stood awkwardly by the couch. “What, do you want us to go eat it on the street?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean on the couch,” Rio explained. “Shouldn’t we eat at the table?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to finish the film,” Agatha dismissed as she opened the fridge. “Now what do you want to drink?”
    </p>
<p>
     No reply.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked round again and when she saw her still stood there.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you know how I love tormenting you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I may slightly recall that, yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well property distinction isn’t my vibe,” Rio looked at the couch, “and I know the moment I start eating on that couch, I’m going to drop something on it and it looks super expensive.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine. I let Senõr Scratchy on it all the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t move and Agatha sighed in defeat. “Pick yourself something to drink and grab me a coke.”
    </p>
<p>
     She walked into the bedroom and grabbed one of her blankets. Carrying it back through to the living area, she threw it over the couch, covering the majority of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “There. Better?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and settled down, placing the two coke cans on the table. The moment Agatha opened the pizza, Rio jumped in and devoured a slice before she even had chance to turn the movie back on. They ate their fill between jumping and laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     After she’d had enough pizza, Agatha noticed Rio pull the blanket up at her side to wrap around herself. It wasn’t a particularly cold night, but Rio looked so snug wrapped up that she had to do the same.
    </p>
<p>
     “Copycat,” Rio teased, before shuffling closer so their side’s touched. Between the blanket and the warmth radiating from Rio’s body to hers, Agatha couldn’t remember ever feeling so cosy.
    </p>
<p>
     When the credits rolled, Agatha switched off the film, but didn’t move away.  “What did you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio answered. “Not great, but it was fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I agree.”
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in silence for a few moments, and the previous cosiness began to feel rather stiff.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Rio piped up, “what do you want to do now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want a glass of wine?” Agatha asked, “or some whisky?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you having any?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but you can if you want.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nah, I’ll just have what you’re having.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A coffee?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reluctantly pulled herself off the couch and went to turn on her coffee maker. As she prepared their drinks, she kept stealing glances back at Rio, who was leaning over the arm of the couch, grinning at Senõr Scratchy. The sight made her smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can feed him if you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to her hopefully. “Can I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pointed at the cupboard below his cage. “His feed is in there. Give him a couple of cups full.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quickly got up and knelt down in front of the cage. Agatha supervised as Rio scooped up some food and carefully poured it into Senõr Scratchy’s food bowl, who quickly moved to tuck in. She repeated the process again before shutting the cage and the cupboard so she could stand back and enjoy her handywork.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re good with animals,” Agatha commented as she finished up the coffees.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, my mom always said I had a green thumb. I guess animals come under that too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wondered which mom she was talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved to sit back down as Agatha carried the coffees over. She held the mug out to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here you go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, my love,” Rio teased with a wink, and Agatha tried desperately not to blush.  She sat down on the couch, leaning her back in the corner of the couch so she could face Rio fully.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s fine. She called me not long after we talked last night. She said we’re ‘adorable’”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. “I’m not, nor ever will be, adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Please, I have photographic evidence.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No you don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled out her phone. “Okay so there’s this one of you pointing at the lilly pads…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to grab her phone, but Rio was quick to dodge her. She hid her phone behind her back and held her finger up to stop her. “Stealing is a crime.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can afford a good lawyer,” Agatha sassed back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a sip of her coffee. “Try get it then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her coffee on the table and slowly crawled across the couch until she and Rio were face to face. “Is that a challenge?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze darted all over her face, and Agatha tried to ignore the way it loitered a beat longer on her lips. Eventually, their eyes met, and Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if it was?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled deviously, confident enough that Rio was adequately distracted. She cautiously snuck her hand behind Rio, before quickly snatching up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio went to grab it back, but Agatha jumped up out of her reach. “It’s got Face ID so you aren’t getting in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like that’s ever stopped me,” Agatha shot back, only for her smile to fade when she saw the lockscreen.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew it would be her and Rio. She even knew what picture it was. Still, there was something about seeing it. Seeing them smiling back at her like it was the most normal thing in the world. It made them look almost…real?
    </p>
<p>
     Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio put her mug on the coffee table. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha quickly insisted as she handed back the phone. “I like the lock screen.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel Rio watching her sit down, but she chose to ignore it. Instead, she reached for her coffee and looked out the window.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s dark out there. Billy will be getting out of his concert about now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you heard anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He let me know when he got to the venue, and Eddie is giving him a ride home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is Eddie his boyfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Agatha confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to admit, I stalked his profile a little. The post he put on about you being the first one he came out to was beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. She had to admit, she had scrolled through her nephew’s profile when she first got the app, and if the number of posts with her wasn’t heartwarming enough, the photo from his parents anniversary party and the caption underneath almost brought her to tears.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness wasn’t a crier (except when it counted).
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew for a while though,” Agatha admitted. “His parents were oblivious, but I could tell. I could see he had the same…” She wasn’t sure how to describe it. The inner turmoil, the feeling like you were being pulled in every direction, the excitement and the fear. She knew the fear the most pf all. “I waited for him to be ready, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Has he been out long?” Rio asked, and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. Rio looked at her in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “He told me a year ago,” Agatha answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her until the penny dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached for her coffee and took a large gulp. “Right. Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we move on?” Agatha suggested, taking a sip from her own mug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good idea,” Rio agreed. “So what’s the deal with this Wanda chick?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did not just say ‘chick’.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to call her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anything but chick.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned in clear annoyance. “Stop deflecting and give me the tea.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I already gave you coffee.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine. Fine.” Agatha shifted on the couch, tucking her legs underneath her. “We were friends, then we were more, and now we are neither.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Interesting.” Rio tilted her head. “Tell me more.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “We met through work. We became best friends. She got married. Her brother died and she…I’m not proud of it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her for a moment before bursting out laughing. “Wait, you were the mistress?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I was not,” Agatah huffed. “They had a trial separation, and she was lonely. We went out one night so she could let her hair down and we…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ended up fucking each other’s brains out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. “Okay, okay. Anyway, we started just casually…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Having sex,” Agatha corrected. “Then we started dating. She pretty much lived at my old apartment. Her house with her husband is not far from Rebecca’s, and her office was in the city, so she started staying over because it was easier. She told me he had gone back to England. He’s English but moved over here for college. Anyway, she said she was going on a business trip. She came back a week later telling me they were back together. Three months later, she announced she was pregnant with twins.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” Rio cursed. “That must have hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Worse things have happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, that must have been one of the worst days ever. Like if you had to pick a top five…”
    </p>
<p>
     “A top five worst days? That’s morbid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I can tell you mine if you tell me yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “I’d have to think about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll hold you to that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure you will.”
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was, Agatha knew what the five would be straight away, and Wanda leaving her was nowhere close.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what is Wanda doing now? Besides invading your workplace?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I blocked her on everything, and Jen cut her off too. Rebecca told me she heard the twins were boys, and she bumped into Wanda not long ago. Her and her husband have split up for real this time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha noticed Rio’s jaw tighten. “Are you interested?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not in the slightest,” she insisted. “Actually, the whole reason…” She quickly stopped herself. “Never mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, tell me!” Rio pleaded.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered it for a minute, before deciding she couldn’t lie about it. “Wanda wanted to pass on her new number when Rebecca saw her, and Rebecca wanted me to give her another chance.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh.” Rio clicked her tongue. “So Rebecca is Team Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she just thinks I’m lonely.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How can I be?” Agatha sassed. “Fake dating takes up most of my free time these days.”
    </p>
<p>
     That made Rio laugh. “Is that why you said we were dating? Because of Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it was because Billy started arguing with his mum saying we were dating, and I just went with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because he saw the group chat.” Rio clicked her fingers. “I remember now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now Wanda has wiggled her way back into my work life, so I’m just as fucked.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it when you swear.” Rio shuffled closer to her. “And must I remind you that you have an awesome fake girlfriend, so she can fester in the knowledge she let a good thing go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You think I’m a good thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, before things got messed up the first time, I thought you were my dream girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     It took Agatha a minute to fully compute what Rio had just said. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     She nodded. “Then I thought better of it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh you did, did you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded again. “But I can still see why you’re a catch for someone else.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d say back at you, but only a special person would put up with your nonsense.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cackled. “You put up with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Barely.” Agatha quickly checked her watch. “It’s getting late. Do you want me to give you a lift home?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that you telling me to go?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no. Just whenever your ready I’ll drive you home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can get a taxi,” Rio assured. “The kid will be on his way back to the burbs by now. Have a glass of wine with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to wait up until he texts you he’s home, aren’t you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You really are aunt of the year,” Rio teased, at which Agatha nodded. She took great pride in it, in fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Rio set her now empty mug aside and shuffled so they were once again sat side by side, “I want to share one glass of wine with you tonight, so I guess I’m waiting too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on. It’s Friday, and I’m not having your fifteen-year-old nephew stay out later than me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, fine,” Agatha gave in. It didn’t take much persuading. “What shall we do in the meantime?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know.” Rio’s voice was quiet now, and Agatha was suddenly aware of how
     <em>
      close
     </em>
     they were. “You tell me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha searched her face, and she felt Rio’s search hers. The air between them was heavy. No, magnetic. The pull was too much to fight even if she wanted to. And she wasn’t sure if she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart beat fast, her body tingled with anticipation, her eyes couldn’t tear themselves away from Rio’s soft, welcoming lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Screw it.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned in, and she saw Rio do the same. Her eyes fluttered closed the moment she left Rio’s breath on her lips. Closer, closer…
    </p>
<p>
     BANG, BANG, BANG.
    </p>
<p>
     They both jumped apart and look to the door.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She was up on her feet in and rushed across the room to yank the door open.
    </p>
<p>
     There was her nephew, with a cracked phone in his hand, and his face a mess of tears and eyeliner.
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy, what happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     He threw himself into her arms. “Eddie and I got into a fight and I threw my phone across the bathroom and he left me there and I didn’t know what to do and I can’t use my phone and I know mom and dad will never let me out the house again and I think me and Eddie are over and I didn’t know what to do and mom gave me the fob for your building…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay.” Agatha pulled him into a hug, rocking him like she did when he was a small child. He clung to her, crying into her shoulder. “I’ll call your mom and I’ll see what she wants us to do, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded and pulled away from her, wiping his cheeks with his sleeve. His gaze then travelled beyond Agatha, and he managed a small wave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey kid.” Rio patted the spot Agatha had just left. “Come sit with me while your aunt calls your mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy nodded and moved to sit down next to her. Agatha gave Rio a thankful look before scooping up her phone and rushing into her bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Aunt of the year? She deserved aunt of the century at this point.

<p>
     Rio sat awkwardly on the couch. She could hear Agatha’s voice coming from her bedroom, and from the sounds of it she was trying and failing to calm her sister.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy slumped beside her, sniffling and wiping away at his eyes. His eyeliner was everywhere, making him look like he was cosplaying The Crow. Though he had totally tongue-blocked her and Agatha (because really?!), she couldn’t be mad at the kid. She knew all too well heartbreak sucked.
    </p>
<p>
     “My first girlfriend dumped me in McDonalds,” Rio told him. “My mom was doing a two-month residency in Vegas, and we rented a house in the suburbs. I met this girl, and I thought she was some kind of angel. We dated two weeks, then she told me she’d cheated on me with a girl at her school because ‘I’d be gone soon so what was the point in committing?’”.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked at her in surprise. “What did you do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I threw my milkshake at her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No way!
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think if it happened today there’d a TMZ headline like ‘rockstar’s step-daughter causes havoc in McMilkshake frenzy!’”
    </p>
<p>
     That got a laugh out of him. “I forgot you’re kind of famous.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice is,” she clarified. “I’ll be just a footnote in a biography.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You could have been a total nepo-baby if you wanted to though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Once me and Alice thought about starting a band. She’s good with keys and I used to drum.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t anymore?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nah, I mean I can, but I don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can play guitar,” Billy told her. “And Agatha is a great singer. We could form a band!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know music is a medicine for heartbreak, kid, but I don’t think this is the answer.”
    </p>
<p>
     He nodded sadly. “It would be fun though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It would, maybe for one night only.” She moved to stand up. “You hungry?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A little. We planned on getting a burger on the way home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I can offer you pizza or cake? Anything else, I can’t authorize.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cake please.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Coming right up.” Rio went to raid the kitchen for plates and cutlery. She had just given Billy some water and was about to plate up the squares of cake she had cut when Agatha emerged. She had changed into a worn pair of jeans and a hoodie, and somehow looked even better than before.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your mom wants you home," Agatha said as she sat down with Billy. "Your dad was going to come get you, but I think it's easier if I take you."
    </p>
<p>
     Billy nodded in understanding. "Are they mad?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as Agatha rubbed calming circles into his back. "They just want you home."
    </p>
<p>
     Billy took a sip of his water, and Agatha took the opportunity to give Rio a guilty look. Yep, Rebecca was mad.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're having cake because the kid needs food," Rio announced. "Want some?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her watch. "Sure, why not?"
    </p>
<p>
     She plated the slices up and carried them over, handing them out before flopping down next to Agatha with her own. Billy devoured his cake like he hadn’t eaten in days.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is so good!"
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Agatha agreed. "Where did you get it?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tapped her nose. "It's need to know."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. "Fine, be cryptic and mysterious over a cake of all things."
    </p>
<p>
     "You like me cryptic and mysterious," Rio teased, not missing the way Agatha's lips curled at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sorry for interrupting your date," Billy said. "I didn't know what else to do."
    </p>
<p>
     "You did the right thing, kid," Agatha assured. "Right, Rio?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah. It's no big deal," Rio assured.
    </p>
<p>
     Only it was a big deal. If Billy had gotten there five minutes later, he would have been interrupting a full-on make out session. Maybe it was for the best; they had said they wouldn't cross that line again. Still, she wished he'd waited just another moment longer.
    </p>
<p>
     They finished their desserts and Agatha instructed Billy to go wash his face. As soon as he was out of earshot, Agatha looked to Rio with apologetic eyes. "Rio, I'm..."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay," she assured. "I'm just glad he's okay."
    </p>
<p>
     "Still, I'll drop you home on the way."
    </p>
<p>
     "Like hell you will."
    </p>
<p>
     "What?"
    </p>
<p>
     "You're not driving back that late by yourself," Rio told her. "You need someone to keep you awake."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll be fine," Agatha assured. "I've had a coffee."
    </p>
<p>
     "That may be, but it's still not a risk I'm willing to take."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're so annoying," Agatha huffed, and Rio knew she had won.
    </p>
<p>
     When Billy was ready, they all headed down to the parking garage and headed over to Agatha’s car.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shotgun!" Rio called, and Billy groaned.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come on!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Rules are rules, kid."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're such a child," Agatha scolded, but Rio just ran around the car cackling.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy chose to sit in the middle seat as Agatha drove them out of the city. For a while they were quiet, listening to the radio. Rio kept stealing glances at Agatha, admiring how the streetlights and shadows brought out the sharpness of her features. That jaw and that damn nose would be the death of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “He said I was being distant,” Billy suddenly announced.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned in her seat to look at him. “Why did he say that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He said he doesn’t feel like I’m as committed as he is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Agatha and saw her gripping the steering wheel a little too tight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did he have to tell you that tonight?” Rio questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “We started arguing because I wanted to get closer to the stage and he worried we’d get lost in the crowd. We ended up going to the bathroom and we started really arguing there. I told him he’s just like my parents sometimes. Putting me in bubble wrap and wondering why it makes me frustrated. Then he threw it in my face saying I should be more grateful people cared about me enough to do that. Anyway, we carried on arguing and he said I was trying to push him away, and that I needed to decide if I was ready for a steady relationship. I insisted I was, but he said I was being childish, and I got so mad. I threw my phone against the wall, and he started shouting at me saying I needed to calm down. Then some random security guy came in and told us to take it outside. Eddie stormed out and by the time I got out there, he was gone. I couldn’t call him, so I went to where we parked the car, and it was already gone. I panicked, but I remembered my way to Agatha’s building so walked from there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave him a sympathetic look. The only thing worse than teenage drama was queer teenage drama. “Well, you’re on your way home now. And I’m sure things will seem clearer in the morning, right Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t reply. Her eyes were fixed to the road, but she had hold of the steering wheel so tight that her knuckles were white, and her jaw was set tight making it impossibly sharper. It was both terrifying and incredibly sexy.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Right
     </em>
     , Agatha?” she repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you say, honey,” Agatha said stiffly. Rio looked to Billy, who seemed equally concerned. She had never seen Agatha this angry, and that was saying something.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cleared her throat and changed the subject. “So where are we heading for your dad’s birthday, Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We always go to the same restaurant every year,” he answered. “My dad loves it there. It’s in the city too, which is fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You like the city?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love going there, even if this time sucked.” Billy looked to Agatha, his eyes bright with adoration. “I want to go to college there, then Agatha will never get rid of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You wouldn’t want anything to do with me in college,” Agatha told him, her voice a little lighter to Rio’s relief. “You’ll be too busy having fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy thought for a moment, then shook his head. “Nah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and searched Agatah’s face for her reaction. A secret smile ghosted her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think Eddie has called me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stiffened up again, and Rio knew she had to bite the bullet before they ended up rear-ending a car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t answer him if he does,” she instructed. “He left you in the city by yourself. Forget about the little fucker.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha scolded.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? It’s true.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s not a little fucker,” Billy defended. “He’s the love of my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well if he is, he’ll apologise,” Rio insisted. “And if he doesn’t, screw him. You also don’t have to accept his apology, because I wouldn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a sideways glance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Love overcomes all obstacles,” Billy said. “Look at you two.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but we’re adults,” Agatha told him. “There’s no rush to meet the love of your life. Look at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And me,” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy leaned forward. “You do realise you two just admitted to being in love, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slouched in her seat, while Agatha reached behind and pushed Billy back into his seat. “Stop teasing. My love life isn’t the one under discussion.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then mine isn’t for the rest of this journey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine by me,” Agatha replied and turned up the radio. Rio bit back a laugh, only for it to stop when she felt Agatha’s hand reach across her, resting just above her knee. She looked to her, but Agatha’s focus was on the road.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled softly and placed her hand over Agatha’s. Suddenly the streetlights felt like stars.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, they pulled into the Kaplan’s drive and Agatha put the car in park. Rio could see the curtains twitching; anxious parents awaiting their son’s return.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took off her seatbelt and looked back at her nephew. “Billy, why don’t you head in. I need to talk to Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please.” It wasn’t a question.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy reluctantly climbed out the car, and they both watched him cautiously approach the front door. Rio had to admit, she felt bad for the kid. He had two helicopter parents and a terrifying aunt who all wanted the best for him, but he was too much of a teenager to understand that. He’ll probably realise how lucky he is when it’s too like, just like she did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Agatha in confusion. “What for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Saying what I wanted to.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did well holding your tongue,” Rio praised. “I know you hate seeing Billy hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at her lap. “You have no idea. Still, thank you. You really didn’t have to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “It pissed me off too. The nerve of that kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Agatha tilted her chin up. “No boy will ever be good enough for him, but I’d settle for him being with one who treats him well. This one no longer has my blessing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you a one-chance kind of girl?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why, are you?” Agatha threw back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I used to be,” Rio admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted so she was facing her fully. “And now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I might be…reevaluating my stance on the matter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but a sharp knock made them jump. They both looked to see Rebecca’s face at the drivers-side window.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled down the window. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you two are done canoodling, we’re having a family meeting.” She shot Rio an unfavourable look. “I guess she can come too, seeing as she seems to be attached to your hip.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh she’s certainly been attached to my….”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca covered her ears. “Nope, nope, nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both laughed at Rebecca’s retreating form, before looking to each other again. Agatha gave her a wink before climbing out of the car, and Rio of course followed.
    </p>
<p>
     The Kaplan family meeting turned out to be mostly shouting, and surprisingly not from Agatha. It seemed she wasn’t the only one in this family with fire. Rio found herself in the corner of the kitchen, watching it unfold with hidden amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are never EVER going in the city again!”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gave his mom a look of disdain that had Agatha all over it. “We’re going there on Tuesday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be a smart-ass,” Jeff scolded him. “You’re lucky your aunt was home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She said she would be,” Billy argued. “And you gave me the fob for her building.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha never said she would be home,” Rebecca clarified. “She could have been at Rio’s with her phone ready in case you called.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she wasn’t,” Billy looked to Agatha. “Are you going to say something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, who was sat on the countertop, looked back at him sympathetically. “You need to listen to your parents, kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…fine. Rio, you said I did the right thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly all eyes in the room were on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean the right thing to do would have been not to smash up your phone,” she offered. “But at least you knew to go somewhere safe.”
    </p>
<p>
     “See!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca shot Rio a glare, before looking to Agatha. “Do you agree with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled over at Rio. “The lady is always right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca put her hands on her hips. “Seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held up her hands. “Look, Rebecca, it’s all an unfortunate chain of events. I stayed home in case he needed me, and he did. Yes, he shouldn’t have smashed up his phone, but he’s a teenager and they make mistakes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, and so did Eddie,” Billy added.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, he chose to leave you,” Agatha reminded him. “Like Rio said in the car, he needs to apologise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca shot Rio another glower. “And why is your girlfriend getting involved?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rebecca…” Jeff warned, but Agatha had already jumped down from the counter. Rio bit her lip as Agatha approached her sister, the slight height difference doing overtime.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” Rebecca scoffed. “Not that long ago you hated her, and now she’s giving my son advice? This time next week she’ll probably be gone again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like you know anything about me and Rio,” Agatha shot back. “This isn’t some fling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever, Agatha. I don’t believe you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s true, Mom,” Billy jumped in. “They love each other. They said so in the car.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes snapped to meet Agatha’s, which were equally wide with surprise. Of course the kid remembered that bit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca seemed to soften a little. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stole another glance at Rio and shrugged. “What can I say? I like the crazy girls.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned at that and found the courage to step forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry if I was overstepping,” she told the Kaplans. “I just wanted to help. Sometimes you need advice from someone not in your family, you know?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff nodded in understanding. “Thanks, we appreciate that. Don’t we, Rebecca?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca reluctantly nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “And who knows,” Jeff said with a grin, “from the sound of things, maybe you won’t be out of the family for much longer!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved between them. “And I think it’s time we set off, right babe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, sweetheart,” Rio agreed. “You owe me a glass of wine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff checked his watch. “It’s pretty late for you to be heading back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll be fine,” Agatha assured, before putting her arm around Rio. “And the lady wants her wine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned into the embrace. Agatha was so warm around her that she just wanted to be totally engulfed in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you need to stay,” Rebecca insisted. “My blood pressure is high enough tonight, and I don’t need visions of you two in a car wreck making it worse. If you have plans tomorrow, you can leave early.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t particularly want to stay. Webbers was fed, and Lilia said she’d be disappointed to see her home (the words ‘finally seal the deal’ were shouted after her as she left), but this wasn’t her house. This wasn’t even Agatha’s house. It was her fake kind-of in-law’s house, and that just made it more awkward.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted to look at her. “I think I should get Rio home…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please stay,” Billy begged. “We can have a sleepover in the living room! Can we go to the gas station to get snacks?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are going straight to bed, Mister,” Jeff told him. “And I’ll have that phone, thank you very much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t even work,” Billy argued, but Jeff held his hand out anyway. He handed over the phone with a huff, before giving his dad a hug. Rio felt Agatha pull her a little closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gave his mom a hug, which she returned with an added kiss on the cheek. After he, he looked to Agatha, yet instead of b-lining for his aunt, Rio found herself pulled into the hug also.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for bringing me home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rubbed circles in his back while Agatha kissed the side of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anything for you,” Agatha told him. “Remember that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy nodded and smiled at both of them, before heading upstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca clasped her hands together. “Right, well, luckily I made the guest room the other day, so it’ll be ready for you both.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take the couch,” Agatha quickly offered. “I’ll grab some of the spare blankets…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, we’re not naïve,” her sister stated. “We know you two sleep together. It’s fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No buts.” Rebecca placed a hand on her shoulder. “Thank you for bringing him home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded in acceptance. “Come on, you guys must be tired too.”
    </p>
<p>
     They all retired upstairs. To Rio’s surprise, the guestroom had its own bathroom, and a queen-sized bed big enough for them to sleep comfortably side by side.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled open one of the draws and pulled out two t-shirts. “These should be okay for us to sleep in.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tossed one over to Rio, who unfolded it to see how big it was. “Erm Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Slight problem.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not wearing any underwear.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked back at her. “You’re not wearing underwear?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I never wear underwear.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did last time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Last time I had to sit in a conference room full of old men. It’s not like I thought I’d be sleeping with anyone tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sleeping next to,” Agatha corrected her. “And let me see what I have.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha rummage through the draws, before holding up a pair of boxer shorts. “There you go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed the boxer shorts suspiciously. “Who’s are those?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mine,” Agatha answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yours?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I must have left them hear last time I stayed over.”
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio was curious to see Agatha in boxers (and nothing else). She accepted them and looked to the bathroom. “Can I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Agatha answered. “There should be a spare toothbrush under the sink.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and retreated to the bathroom. After a quick change and a careful teeth-brushing, she headed back into the bedroom, just in time to catch sight of Agatha’s bare back, legs and black-laced panties as she pulled the shirt down over her.
    </p>
<p>
     She quickly retreated back into the bathroom and waited a beat before heading out again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bathrooms all yours,” she announced, and Agatha nodded before disappearing behind the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the time to explore the room. It was pretty plain. Not much on the walls, and nothing really personal. All besides a picture frame on the vanity. She picked it up to have a closer look. It was an old photograph of two girls. The younger one was smiling from ear to ear, while the other’s smile was forced, stiff. Though her features were lighter, she knew it was Agatha, aged maybe nine or ten, sat with her sister on a rock by the ocean.
    </p>
<p>
     The bathroom door opened, and Agatha slipped back into the room. Rio held the picture up to her. “You were cute.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rebecca was cute,” she corrected. “Come on, let’s get into bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio climbed into the left side while Agatha took the right. Once they were both settled, Agatha swapped the main light for the small lamp on her bedside table. The light was golden, catching light shadows around the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry about them,” Agatha said. “I didn’t want you caught up in family drama.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Rio assured. “The evening certainly hasn’t gone how I expected, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “You could say that again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nice you have such a good relationship with Billy,” Rio commented. “He really looks up to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “He’s just a kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But he’s a good kid. You get some credit for that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile faded. “I don’t know. There are things I’ve done…I just wish I’d done things differently.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to ask what, but she could see the pain on Agatha’s face and hated it too much to push further. “Well, from what I can see, you’re the person he trusts the most. You should be proud of that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess.” Agatha gave Rio a little shrug. “My mother used to say anything I touched turned out rotten. I just hope I haven’t done that to him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “Why did your mom say that about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted to look at the ceiling. “Mother…she said I was born evil. I can’t remember her ever being kind to me. She said I had the devil in me, and that I needed to repent. Sometimes she’d lock me in the pantry, and I would end up covered in spiders. At first, I didn’t understand what was going on and I was scared, but I got used to it. My grandmother and dad knew, but there wasn’t anything they could do. Any accusation was dismissed because there was no way Evanora Harkness-pillar of the community-would ever do such a thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her in disbelief. “What the fuck?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha then turned on her side to look at her. “She sent me to an all-girls catholic school, and I felt so alone. I didn’t believe in any of it. How could I? According to my mother, I was the spawn of Satan. Then I met this girl. She didn’t fit in, like me, so we started hanging out between classes. One day we snuck under the bleachers in the gym, and she kissed me. Suddenly the world became so much clearer, but also so much more terrifying. I knew Mother would kill me if she found out, and it wasn’t a really good idea to be out lesbians at a catholic school, so it was our secret.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then she found out?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “We were stupid. We’d used the photobooth at the roller rink, and we kissed in one of the pictures. I hid it in my room, but mother found it anyway. She locked me in the pantry for hours until I managed to kick the door open. I ran upstairs and packed a bag. I told her I was going to my dad’s, and she said she would get me back, and she’d make me ‘think the right way’.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clenched the sheet in a tight fist. She wanted to kill this woman more than anything.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said I was still leaving anyway and that I hated her. She just laughed and said…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Said what?” Rio prompted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, and Rio swore she could see tears shimmering in her eyes. “She said she should have killed me the moment I left her body. I haven’t spoken to my mom in over 30 years. Those were the last words she said to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence hung heavily over them. Rio didn’t know what to say, so instead she just stared at the ceiling. Eventually, the words came.
    </p>
<p>
     “She never deserved to be your mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “You’re not too bad, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I guess you’re not either, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     They exchanged smiles, before their eyes locked on to the ceiling again, laying there in the thick silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mom died.” Rio hadn’t realised she’d said it until it was out of her mouth, and wished she could push it back in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lorna?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, my birth mom,” Rio explained. “She died when I was six.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit,” Agatha cursed. “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She used to like making homemade teas from flower petals. She drank the wrong one. My dad found her when she didn’t pick me up after his weekend. She’d been there a while.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha covered her mouth with her hand. “Oh Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a long time ago,” Rio shrugged it off. “I don’t remember her much. Just what people have told me about her. The only parents I really knew were my dad and Lorna.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you have any pictures of her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “I’ll show you sometime. People say we look alike.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then she must have been one beautiful lady,” Agatha quipped, and that managed to make Rio smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess.” Rio thought for a moment before laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just realised how fucked up we both are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Darling, I’ve known that for weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both laughed, trying to keep quiet to not disturb the Kaplan’s. When they’d fallen quiet again, Rio looked at Agatha with soft eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry about your mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded in acceptance. “I’m sorry about yours too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached out and took her hand under the covers, and Agatha’s thumb began to rub circles into the back of her hand. The motion was comforting, soothing, and Rio’s eyelids became heavier and heavier. No sooner did they flutter close did she find herself awake again, only it was morning, and Agatha was alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking around the room, Rio saw her jeans and a hoodie she didn’t recognise folded on the bed. It seemed Agatha had picked her outfit for the day. She sat up and stretched her arms up before swinging her legs over the bed. Changing quickly (keeping Agatha’s boxers on because…well she just wanted to) and freshening up, she made her way downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     The Kaplan’s were sat at the breakfast table, with Agatha sat beside Billy sipping a coffee. When she saw Rio, she smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “There she is.” She got up and pulled out the chair on the other side of her. “I’ll make you a coffee. Help yourself to cereal.”
    </p>
<p>
     The last part didn’t happen. The moment she sat down, Jeff had put the bowl in front of her and Billy enthusiastically poured Lucky Charms into her bowl.
    </p>
<p>
     “These are my favourite,” he told her, and she smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mine too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s good seeing he gave you no choice,” Agatha commented from cross the kitchen, and Billy bowed his head sheepishly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca pushed the milk across to her. “Pour your milk before one of them decides to pour it for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     The boys looked embarrassed, and Rio smiled to match Rebecca’s smirk. She was starting to catch the family resemblance now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked over and handed her the coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio said as she took it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome, my love.” Agatha kissed the top of her head and sat down beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost dropped her drink but managed to catch herself. She set the mug aside and began to eat her cereal, trying to hide the blush burning her cheeks, and bit back the grin that threatened to split her face in two.
    </p>
<p>
     They said goodbye to the Kaplan’s after breakfast. Agatha got a bag of their things from the guest room before starting an argument with her sister about stripping the sheets. Eventually, Rio had enough and did it herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hugged her family goodbye, while Rio gave them all an awkward wave. Besides Billy, of course. He insisted on a hug from her too.
    </p>
<p>
     And then they were on the road. Agatha driving while Rio sat beside her, watching the morning traffic passing them by.
    </p>
<p>
     “You survived a night in the Kaplan house,” Agatha commented. “Well done you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like them,” Rio admitted. “I’m looking forward to the birthday meal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too.” Agatha stole a glance her way before looking back to the road. “I think even Rebecca likes you now, which is an achievement. It took her months to warm up to Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, she definitely likes Wanda now.” Rio hated saying the woman’s name, especially after what Agatha told her the night before.
    </p>
<p>
     “She just thought Wanda would be good for me,” Agatha explained. “Rebecca thinks that the route to my happiness will be a picket fence and a load of kids running around, and Wanda has that built-in now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you want kids?” Rio asked curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I do, but it just hasn’t happened for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It still might?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “I think that window has gone for me, and I wouldn’t want to do it alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We could have one,” Rio suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “What, are we going to get fake married now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but we could co-parent? We do make a good team, you have to admit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to slap herself. “Sorry, that was stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it isn’t,” Agatha insisted. “It’s just…let’s talk about something else?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in agreement. “So are you going to buy Billy a new phone?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m stopping by the Apple Store after I’ve dropped you off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking knew it.” Rio laughed, and Agatha joined in with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon enough they reached the city, and it wasn’t long before Agatha was pulling up outside Rio’s building.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Rio looked in the back. “Where’s my shirt?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll get it dry cleaned and bring it over,” Agatha replied. “Unless you need it soon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, that’s fine. So, I guess I’ll see you Tuesday?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Enjoy the rest of your weekend and thank you. For helping Billy and helping me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anytime,” Rio said with a grin. She stared back at Agatha. The morning sun was illuminating half her face in a golden glow, soft and warm against her cheek. She looked so pretty that Rio couldn’t resist.
    </p>
<p>
     She unclipped her seatbelt and shot forward, placing a quick kiss against Agatha’s sun-kissed cheek. She watched the other woman blink at her in surprise, and Rio grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Yep, this time she had definitely broken Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed open the car door and jumped out. “See you Tuesday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed and nodded. “S-see you Tuesday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shut the car door and with one last wave through the window, she headed into her building with a skip in her step. Maybe, just maybe, that date wasn’t all that fake after all.

     The moment her phone chimed, Rio was wide awake.
    </p>
<p>
     It was 8am on a Monday. Usually, she wouldn’t be up for another half hour; she didn’t have to be at the college until 10. Yet in some subconscious part of her resting mind, she knew exactly who that text was from, and that was more than enough to rise her from even the deepest of slumbers.
    </p>
<p>
     Reaching for the phone charging on her bedside table, she opened up the message with an untameable grin.
    </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
     There was a pause between the next message, and Rio took the time to get out of bed and head to the bathroom to start her morning routine.
    </p>
<p>
     She was wearing an oversized shirt and Agatha’s boxers, a new essential in her bedtime attire, but also it meant she could walk out into the living room without Lilia catching a glimpse of her butt.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia was up, of course, and was in the process of getting the blender out when she approached the kitchen area. “This is early for you,” she commented. Rio shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Woke up, so thought I’d start the day a bit earlier.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia eyed her suspiciously, but before she could say anything Rio’s phone chimed in her hand. Looking down, she saw Agatha’s reply.

      Mostly meetings. I’m recommending we leave the book as it is.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. They had discussed it a little the night before. Agatha had messaged her saying she didn’t know what to do. The book was amazing, apparently. The plot was gripping, and the love story was so well written, but the fact remained that it would damage the sales. After some exchanged texts, and a phone call that ended up lasting over an hour, Agatha had decided to sleep on it. Rio had been rooting for her to say yes, but she had to let Agatha make the decision herself.

<p>

      Oh you have no idea how useful I can be.

</p>
<p>
     The sound of Lilia clearing her throat brought her back to the present.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t even have to ask who you’re messaging, but will you tear yourself away from that phone for a moment to help me with these smoothies.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t we have pancakes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio set her phone aside and got to work slicing up the fruit.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two seem to be talking a lot more,” Lilia commented.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess,” Rio said dismissively.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can tell just from the way you look at her texts that you’re absolutely smitten, but don’t get distracted. You’re so close to getting your doctorate and I know new relationships are exciting…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha knows that,” Rio insisted. “And I’m doing fine. My tutor said I’m far ahead of schedule anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s phone dinged and she looked over at it longingly. She heard Lilia chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You two really need to have sex,” she said. “Before you explode.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not that bad,” Rio insisted, but that only made Lilia laugh more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh please. She sends you a text and you’re practically foaming at the mouth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I’m not!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just do yourselves and everyone else in a fifty-foot radius a favour and resolve that sexual tension already! Because I swear, if I spend another night having to hear you moan…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio covered her ears. “Lalala. I can’t hear you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, alright.” Lilai held up her hands. “But you get the message.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped her hands. “Great, now I have fruit juice in my hair.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia laughed again. “I’m not even to say what I was thinking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’re the one who needs to get laid,” Rio accused as she moved to the sink to wash the fruit off her hands. “And for that, you can finish the smoothies by yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked up her phone and flopped down on the couch, opening Agatha’s message.

</p>
<p>
     The bender turned on, loud and sudden.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio jumped in her seat, dropping her phone on the couch. She whirled round with a face like thunder. “Lilia!”
    </p>
<p>
     Her roommate just smirked. “So tense, and we all know why.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her the middle figure before turned back around and folding her arms. She hated that she was totally right.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha walked through the office with a warm smile, greeting her employees as she walked by their desks. Some smiled back, some offered weak waves, while others just stared. Sharon was the only one who greeted her with equal enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning, boss,” Sharon said with her usual grin. “You seem happy this morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am,” Agatha replied. “It’s a beautiful morning, and I get to come to work to see your wonderful smile.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon’s smile didn’t faulter, but the slight lift of her eyebrows showed her surprise. “Well I’m pleased to see you in such a good mood. And to make your day even better, I decided to do some baking yesterday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What kind of baking?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon moved around her desk and brought out three cake tins. “What do you want to start with? Brownies, cookies, or rocky road.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cookie, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon held out the tin and Agatha picked out the one she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anytime, sweetie. So now you know how I spent my weekend, what did you get up to?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio and I ended up staying at my sisters’ on Friday, then I spent most of Saturday trying to find the latest iPhone for my nephew. Why do those things always sell out? Surely, they must know everyone will want it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You and Rio seem to be going strong,” Sharon commented.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha nodded. “We are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad.” Sharon patted her affectionately on the arm. “Happiness suits you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Sharon one last smile before walking into her office, cookie in hand. She dropped her bag by her desk and placed the cookie on top of her closed laptop. Getting out her phone, she took a picture and sent it to Rio.

     Agatha chuckled, wishing she could see Rio’s reactions. She wished she could just see her, in all honesty. It was strange. They had gone days without talking and now even after speaking non-stop all weekend, she couldn’t get enough.
    </p>

     She opened her laptop and pulled up her schedule for the day.

</p>
<p>

     😈
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tipped her head back and laughed, swinging her chair lightly from side to side. She couldn’t wait until 2pm.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio waited anxiously in the lobby of Agatha’s work. Her morning class had dragged because she knew most of it already, and the lab was too busy for her to get much work done. What got her through was seeing Agatha, even just for twenty minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     She soon saw Agatha exit the elevator, dressed in a navy pantsuit that made Rio bite her lip. She watched Agatha survey the lobby before their eyes met.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and walked over to her. “Is that my hoodie?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down and cursed. In all the excitement, she forgot she was wearing the hoodie she borrowed Saturday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. Sorry I’ll get it washed and I’ll…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no.” Agatha looked her up and down appraisingly. “Keep it. It suits you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, bowing her head in the hope of hiding her blush. “So coffee?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but before I forget.” Agatha reached into her handbag and pulled out a small Tupperware box. “Sharon says hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!” Rio took the box and ripped the lid off. “No way! I get all three?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, you’re acting like I just gave you Superbowl tickets.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck the Superbowl. I’m hungry.” Rio stuffed the cookie in her mouth as they made their way out of the building, shoving the rest in her bookbag.
    </p>
<p>
     “How was class?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pointless,” Rio replied, chewing the last remnants of the cookie. “We had a guest lecturer, and he did a presentation about Atropa Belladonna. That’s like the gateway poisonous plant. I knew all about it by the time I was Billy’s age. He could have at least gone with something more obscure. Then the lab was full of master’s students getting an induction. And I’m having to sit through an undergraduate lecture based on the very essay I wrote.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The azalea one?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Apparently my findings are a great learning opportunity for the undergraduate class, but I’m just there to answer questions and take notes on
     <em>
      his
     </em>
     observations of
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     findings.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just wait until you’re the world’s leading expert in poisonous plants,” Agatha told her. “Then he’ll be begging you to lecture there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’ll probably take credit for that too,” Rio grumbled. “Anyway, enough about me. Have you had your meeting about that book yet?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what I’ll be heading back for,” Agatha replied, and Rio could hear an uneasiness in her voice. “I’m hoping I can make a convincing argument.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her in disbelief. “Wait, are you nervous?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I’m nervous. The hopes and dreams of every gay girl in this country and beyond rest on me convincing a room full of straight guys that it won’t flop.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t envy her. While morals sometimes came into her research, it was never this momentous.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish you could read it, Rio,” Agatha continued. “I mean, I always loved the main character. While I was editing that first two books, I loved her spunk and her drive to get what she wanted. I was a little sad when the third book went to someone else, but by then I had my big office and fancy couch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do like that couch,” Rio commented as the approached the door to the coffee shop. “But I get it. Sometimes success comes with personal sacrifice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Very wise of you,” Agatha teased as she pulled the coffee shop door open for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio smirked as she stepped inside. “I heard it on a telenovela.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a bit of a queue, but they soon found themselves at the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Usual?” Agatha asked, and Rio nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Two iced coffees to go please,” Agatha told the barista, who rung it up.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw the gleam of the American Express card out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.” She loaded up her apple pay. “I’m not letting you pay again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I’m not letting you pay,” Agatha argued. “I asked you to come all the way out here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted to,” Rio insisted. “Just let me pay. Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha relented, and with a smile, Rio loaded up her Apple Pay and was about to hover it over the reader when a flash of gold beat her to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, I couldn’t help it.”
    </p>
<p>
     The barista looked between them with a combination of fear and confusion before rushing to make their drinks. Once she handed them over, Rio took hers and stormed out of the coffee shop.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio wait!” She heard Agatha called after her and, with the stomp of sprinting stilettos, she quickly appeared beside her. “I’m sorry. I just don’t want you wasting your money on me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t be wasting it,” Rio argued. “You treat me so much. I just want to treat you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What you’ve done for me this weekend alone is beyond what money can buy,” Agatha insisted. “Look, I promise next time I won’t let you pay. I’ll even give you my card so I can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Rio accepted. Looking down, she noticed Agatha, the iconic leftie that she was, had her drink in her left hand. Rio’s was in her right, meaning their empty hands were just hanging there. Such a shame, she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     So, swinging her hand, she casually hooked her fingers with Agatha’s.
     <br/>
     She expected Agatha to freeze, even just for a second, but instead she found their fingers fully laced together. They looked at each other and smiled, before enjoying the quiet closeness on their way back to the office.
    </p>
<p>
     They stopped outside the main doors and Rio couldn’t help but mourn the end of their little interlude.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for meeting me,” Agatha said. “I needed this before I go into the hellmouth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll do fine.” Rio squeezed her hand encouragingly. “And remember, don’t underestimate the sapphic market. We’re a passionate bunch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll definitely keep that in mind.” Agatha lightly swung their joined hands. “I better go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio wanted to fall to her knees and cling to her legs, keeping Agatha there with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squeezed her hand in return. “I’ll let you know how it went later on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes I’ll be waiting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her hand one last squeeze before pulling away. Rio swore she felt the connection break in her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye,” Agatha said as she backed up to the doors.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye,” Rio replied, and watched her go.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, maybe Lilia was right. She was going to explode.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Later, during her designated reading time, Agatha found herself with the now familiar urge to message Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She had wanted to message her as soon as she got out of her meeting, but she didn't want to bother her while she was in class, or straight away when she got home.
    </p>
<p>
     It was ridiculous really. Even with Wanda, she hadn't wanted to see her all the time. They only messaged and called when they had to, and never organised to meet each other during the workday unless it was work related. Yet with Rio, it was different. She enjoyed their pointless conversations and random spontaneous meetups, maybe more than she was willing to admit to even herself.
    </p>
<p>
     She was contemplating what the message should say when Billy's contact photo filled her screen. Agatha answered it with a smile. "This is a surprise."
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I wanted to test out my new phone,"
     </em>
     Billy explained.
     <em>
      "Thanks again. It's awesome."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "I should hope so. I had to go to five different stores to find one. So, how was school?"
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Okay,"
     </em>
     he answered, suddenly not so happy. "
     <em>
      I saw Eddie."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Oh?"
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I waved to him, and he turned away."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hated this. She hated him being so hurt, especially when it was all because of some boy. "I'm sorry, kid, but maybe you'll be able to talk it out with him when it isn't so fresh."
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Maybe, but I've decided I'm going to focus on myself,"
     </em>
     he insisted.
     <em>
      "Like you said, it's worth waiting for the right person."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Exactly, there’s no rush. You’re barely in high school, and I know you really like Eddie. I really liked my high school girlfriend, but sometimes there’s a reason they’re your first and not your last.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I guess. I just wish I could meet my Rio, you know?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Your Rio?” Agatha questioned in surprise. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You know, someone who looks at you like you’re the centre of the universe.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She didn’t reply. She couldn’t reply. She could barely even think.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Hm?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You hadn’t noticed that, had you?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “She’s always looked at me that way,” she quickly dismissed. “She’s just…I don’t know…Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Please, you look at her the same. And you always smile at her all gooey.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t!”
    </p>

</p>
<p>
     “Billy, don’t you dare…”
    </p>
<p>
     He hung up the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” she cursed to herself, before looking to Senõr Scratchy. “What do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     He stared back her, chewing on something rather frantically.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is that?”
    </p>
<p>
     She got up to look and saw a piece of paper half dragged into the cage. “Really?” Reaching in, she snatched it off him, assessing the damage. It was the warranty on Billy’s phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are so lucky I got an email copy,” she said, ripping the paper up and putting it in the bin. “Otherwise I’d be making rabbit pie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Senõr Scratchy didn’t care. He knew her threats were empty.
    </p>
<p>
     Back on the couch, her phone dinged. Moving over, she was expecting more teasing from Billy, or Rebecca scolding her again for buying the phone. Instead, she was pleasantly surprised.

<em>
      Hey how did your meeting go?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, and she had to admit, it did feel a little gooey.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stared at where her phone rested on the arm of the couch, willing it to do something.
    </p>
<p>
     Had she only just messaged her? Yes.
    </p>
<p>
     Was she already impatient waiting for a reply? Also yes.
    </p>
<p>
     She had watched her phone like a hawk all the way through that dumbass lecture, all the way home on the subway, and Lilia had to tell her to leave it in her room during dinner. Yet, Agatha had not made true on her promise to let her know how her meeting went.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t Agatha’s fault. She was a busy lady, and Billy was probably being needy which of course had to be her priority. Still, Rio was desperate to know what happened, how the rest of her afternoon went, what she was up to now.
    </p>
<p>
     Any Agatha news was news worth knowing.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, as she failed to concentrate on the episode of Real Housewives Lilia was currently engrossed in, she bit the bullet and messaged first.
    </p>
<p>
     The wait between the outgoing text and incoming reply was not long in reality, but for Rio it felt like an eternity. And when her screen finally lit up, she scrambled for the phone and opened it without hesitation.

    </p>
<p>
     “Stop doing that,” Lilia scolded. “It’s a bad habit.”

      He’s okay. He loves the phone I got him, even if Rebecca is furious. She’s told me I spoil him too much, but he needed a phone. Even if it’s just for safety reasons. He called me to test it out, so all seems to work. Good job really. Senõr Scratchy ate the paper copy of his warranty! I asked him how school was and he told me he waved at Eddie and that boy turned away from him. The nerve! If I lived closer, I’d go round to his house and settle this myself.

     , admit what was now too powerful to ignore.

     Agatha had cleared her afternoon schedule. She was going to get her hair done, and had already arranged to pop buy a few stores in search of a new outfit, right down to what was underneath. She just had to get through the morning first.
    </p>
<p>
     The anticipation for the evening was near unbearable. She was looking forward to the family meal, no doubt, but she just needed to get Rio to that damn bar. To finally make sense of what was happening between them. Agatha just hoped they were on the same page. She didn’t know what she’d do if they weren’t.
    </p>
<p>
     Her desperation for the evening to arrive was making the morning drag. It seemed recently her work had been a hindrance rather than a passion, and as she sat in her office drafting her out-of-office email, she wondered if this was just a rut, or had she just  become distracted by other things. Or rather someone.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone vibrated on the desk, and when she looked at the notification, she smiled.

     Rio’s reply came in the form of a photo. She was in her room, Agatha could tell, wearing a black sweater with her hair loose in its usual way. Her head propped up by her arm, which seemed to be propped up by her desk. Those brown eyes. That smile. She was the truest beauty Agatha had ever seen.

</p>
<p>
     That had her biting her lip again. God, she couldn’t wait until seven.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hair appointment went without a hitch, and her shopping trip was…fruitful. She took the time to change, applied her make up perfectly and sprayed a ridiculous amount of perfume on. With Senõr Scratchy fed, and her apartment clean (just in case), she headed down to get a cab.
    </p>
<p>
     During the short ride to Rio’s apartment, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. What if Rio didn’t like her outfit? What if the meal went to shit? What if she messed up their talk at the bar? And what if Rio didn’t want her?
    </p>
<p>
     The worries evaporated as the cab pulled up outside Rio’s, replaced with the overwhelming desire to see her fake girlfriend as soon as possible. She offered the driver a generous tip if he waited for her, which he was eager to take, and walked into the building as fast as her stilettos would allow. She got up to Rio’s floor, sped down the corridor to her apartment door, and, sucking in a deep breath, she knocked.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia opened the door and, unlike the last time she came face to face with Rio’s strange roommate, the woman greeted her with a genuine smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, the princess has arrived.”
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps she did look like a princess that evening. She’d decided to abandon her usual suits for a hip-hugging black dress that even had the sales assistant stumbling over her words. Her hopes were for it to have a similar effect on her date for the evening, but she knew that would be unlikely. Rio always had something to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is she ready?” Agatha asked, and Lilia laughed as she shut the door behind them.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been like Project Runway in here, but I think she’s just about ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia walked over and knocked on Rio’s bedroom door. “Your girlfriend is here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just coming!” Rio’s voice carried through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia walked back to Agatha with a knowing smile. “I hope I don’t see her back here tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to hide her shock at the woman’s bluntness. “I’ll try my best.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both looked to the bedroom door as it creaked open, and Agatha swore her heart stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, in a black three-piece suit, no shirt or tie, one hand in her trouser pocket and the other pushing a strand of straightened hair behind her ear. Her lips were painted red, her eyes framed by dark eyeliner and shadow, and she shined with a glow that no make-up could ever replicate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could only stare as Rio looked her up and down with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Holy shit you look good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed and tried to snap herself out of whatever trance Rio had put her under. “You look amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you both look good,” Lilia agreed. “Now can you both go and enjoy yourselves!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked forward and held her arm out to Agatha. “M’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and linked their arms together, the touch electric and addictive. God, she couldn’t wait to get to that bar.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but state. The fresh curls in her hair, her sharp lipstick, and the dress…well that was outright sinful.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know you had a suit like that," Agatha commented as they walked from the cab to the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know you had a dress like that," Rio mirrored back, making Agatha smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "I guess we've both full of surprises then."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned deviously. "You have no idea."
    </p>
<p>
     The restaurant wasn’t as ridiculously fancy as she expected, but it was enough to make Rio glad she made an effort. The Kaplans were already sat at their table, and Billy jumped up so fast Rio thought he was going to go through ceiling. He gave Agatha a hug, before ingulfing Rio in one that was just as enthusiastic.
    </p>
<p>
     “You both look amazing!” He got his phone out of his pocket. “Stand together. I want a photo!”
    </p>
<p>
     They moved close together, and Rio placed a cautious hand on Agatha’s back. She knew they had been less tense when it came to touching, but what she didn’t expect was for Agatha to hook her hand on her waist and press their sides firmly together.
    </p>
<p>
     They smiled at the camera as Billy took the photos, and Rio tried her best to breathe normally. God, what Agatha did to her was downright torturous. She needed to take Lilia’s advice, and soon.
    </p>
<p>
     “Step back so I can take some full-body ones,” Billy instructed and Agatha put her free hand on her hip, still keeping Rio close.
    </p>
<p>
     “We may look like models, kid, but we’re not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     "Billy, let them sit down," his dad said playfully, and Billy relented.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved to sit next to Rebecca and Rio took the seat opposite beside Billy. She knew Agatha had done that on purpose. Though Rebecca had greeted her with a genuine smile, Rio knew she still hadn't completely won her over.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff sat at the head of the table, smiling with birthday glee.
    </p>
<p>
     "Happy Birthday Jeff." Agatha reached into her back and slid over a small black box with a matching bow. "This is from us."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave Agatha a confused look, which she just shrugged at. It seemed their fake relationship was at the shared gift stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff pulled open the box and pulled out a silver watch. “Woah, this is cool!”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked over and his eyes widened. “Don’t they cost…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rebecca gave him a warning look.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff put the watch on and admired it with a smile. “I love it. Thanks, ladies.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Agatha responded, and Rio nodded along.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, happy birthday, Jeff. Thank you for inviting me to celebrate.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, like I said on Saturday, you’re pretty much joining family now,” Jeff insisted. “Figured we best start the birthday traditions now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Agatha, who seemed totally unfazed by her becoming an honorary Kaplan. In fact, she seemed quite pleased about it from the soft smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     God, Rio just wanted to reach over and kiss her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca opened the wine menu. “Since I’m driving tonight, you ladies need to have a bottle of wine for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll have a glass of whisky,” Agatha responded. “I don’t want a repeat of your birthday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” Rio asked, and Billy burst out laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha had too much to drink and said she always wanted to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “One more word and I’m taking that phone back,” Agatha threatened, which affective ended the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about you?” Rebecca looked to Rio hopefully, but she shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wine makes me crazy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head curiously, but Rebecca just tutted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two are boring.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I assure you we’re far from boring.” Agatha winked at Rio, and she had to bow her head to hide her blush.
    </p>
<p>
     The meal went by in a blur of chatter and laughter. Rio could see why Jeff liked the place- the food was unreal- but it was the company that did it for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff was throwing out dad jokes left right and centre which Agatha heckled from her end of the table. Rebecca was also surprisingly witty, and Billy was, well, Billy. He was indeed in love with his new phone, and had insisted on taking some selfies, and got Agatha to take a proper picture of them both as his mom ‘made every photo look weird’.
    </p>
<p>
     They were a quirky family, she had to admit, but a loving one. It had been a long time since she experienced that. Sure, she had Alice, but sometimes a family of two was just as lonely as a family of one. Being an honorary Kaplan was nice, even just for the night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dessert!” Billy announced once their table had been cleared. “We need to have dessert.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We have cake at home,” his mom argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “But Agatha and Rio won’t get any!” Billy looked between them. “Don’t we need to have dessert?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m stuffed, kid,” Agatha admitted, but Rio shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m down if you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy grinned. “Okay, Rio is officially the cool aunt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not even your aunt yet,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Semantics,” Billy dismissed. “She’s still cooler.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I am,” Rio teased, sticking her tongue out at Agatha, who simply raised an eyebrow. She was amused though. Rio could tell by her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t have dessert and cake,” his mom told him. “That’s too much sugar.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But mom…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you share mine?” Rio suggested. “Then technically it’s not two.”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked to Rebecca for confirmation, and she nodded. Billy grinned and grabbed the dessert menu. “What are you getting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you want,” Rio told him, before her eyes gravitated to Agatha again. Agatha bit her lip and Rio felt something brush against her carf. The side of the stiletto heel if she had to guess. She smirked back at Agatha and cocked an eyebrow. Oh, they were going to have fun when they got out of here.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, Agatha’s face dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never seen her look like that. Her mouth hung open, her face paling, and her eyes grew wide with terror. She noticed Rebecca’s eyes had gone equally large, but her lip was pressed tight and nostrils flared.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked round and saw a woman with long grey hair and a collared dress walking over to them. Her eyes were dark and cold, but her face had a sharpness that Rio found strangely familiar.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness. Well I never.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked back to Agatha, who had now sat up in her chair, her jaw tight and lips pursed. Her battle armour. She cleared her throat and stared down the woman with a hatred beyond anything Rio had ever seen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello Mother.”

<div>
<p>
     Evanora Harkness hadn’t changed. Sure her face was now lined, and her hair was completely grey, but it was still the same face Agatha saw in her nightmares. The same voice that echoed in her mind when she saw at her weakest. The same eyes she hoped to never see again.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet there she was, stood behind the two people Agatha didn’t want her anywhere near.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is quite cosy,” Evanora commented, her eyes glancing to Rebecca. “And if it isn’t the little half-sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m more of a sister than you are a mother,” Rebecca shot back. “Please leave.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora ignored her and looked to Jeff. His face was stiff, the joy from moments ago completely gone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whose husband is this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mine,” Rebecca answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Obviously,” Agatha’s sassed. “He’s not going to be mine, is he?”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora’s face tightened. “Some things never change.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then her eyes fixed on Billy, something Agatha had hoped would never happen. Evanora smiled at him. “And who is this young man?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy, in his naivety, smiled back. “I’m...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t talk to her, son,” Jeff told him, and Billy looked between the adults, confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “But she’s Agatha’s mom?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rebecca, their shared guilt lingering in their eyes. Billy had asked about Agatha’s mom before, when he first realised his aunt didn’t call his grandmother mom. They had decided to tell him she didn’t see her mom because she lived far away, even farther than his grandma’s retirement community in Florida.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had always planned on explaining things to him when he was older, but he was young, and the world was shinny to him. Sure bad things happened, but in his eyes, love always won. He didn’t need to know how cruel people can be to people like him, and her.
    </p>
<p>
     “So are you the nephew?” Evanora studied his face. “Yes, you do look like my ex-husband. Poor boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” Agatha snapped. “My sister told you to go, so go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Such manners. I should have known you’d lose what little propriety you had when you left me. Now look at you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dared to glance at Rio, who was glaring at her mother so fiercely she was sure she’d burn a hole in her head. She was holding one of the dessert spoons like a dagger, and Agatha was both relieved and disappointed Jeff’s steak knife had been cleared away.
    </p>
<p>
     “She doesn’t need your approval, Evanora,” Rebecca snapped. “Now leave my family alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m talking to my daughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well she doesn’t want to talk to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her mother twist to face Rio. She looked her up and down with disgust. “Who are you to speak for my daughter?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood from her seat. “Her girlfriend, now back off!”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no.” Agatha jumped up and pulled Rio towards her with the back of her suit jacket. “She’s not worth it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved back but refused to sit down. Rebecca and Jeff had stood too, while Billy remained seated and confused. Agatha could feel eyes on them and saw the waiting staff edging cautiously towards them out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see your still up to your old sinful tricks” Evanora sneered. “Though I have no guilt in it. You were born sinful, unable to repent, and your father only encouraged it. Let’s hope your sister’s boy has escaped this infliction.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha surged forward, her hand aiming for the other woman’s face, but she felt strong arms wrap around her middle, forcing her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not worth it,” Rio repeated into her hair. “She’s just a bitter old bitch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora just laughed vindictively. “I’ll leave you to your meal. It was nice to see you, Agatha. It confirmed all my suspicions.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then finally, she walked away.
    </p>
<p>
     The shock and adrenaline faded, and Agatha began to feel panic building inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     She had to get away. She had to get outside.
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed herself out of Rio’s arm and ran. Ran out of the restaurant, ran down the street. The panic was consuming her, and she couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t breathe and that made her panic more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rebecca’s voice was muffled, but close. “Sit down.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha allowed Rebecca to lower her onto the sidewalk, knees up and hugged to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, remember, breathe and close your eyes. Think of something happy.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried.
    </p>
<p>
     Her grandmother.
    </p>
<p>
     Her dad.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy in a hospital bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy surrounded by tubes and beeping machines.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy unable to open his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy about to die.
    </p>
<p>
     She clenched her eyes shut, still unable to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     She gasped for air.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca’s voice was getting worried.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     Couldn’t breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     Couldn’t breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     Until a pair of brown eyes flashed in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio in the botanical gardens.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio working in her office.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio arguing with a barista for the bathroom key.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she could breathe again.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand cupped her cheek. “Are you okay now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and opened her eyes to look back at her sister. “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have nothing to be sorry for.” Rebecca helped her back to her feet. “I’ll get you in the car and we’ll take you home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll talk to her. Come on. Let’s get you somewhere quiet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha allowed herself to be walked away, wiping the tears from her cheeks. Yet again, her mother had managed to ruin everything.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha flee, Rebecca quick on her tail. She went to go after them, but Jeff put his arm out to stop her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just let Rebecca deal with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust me, I learnt long ago to let the sisters deal with this themselves.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to argue, but she knew that wouldn’t help anything. She sat back down and looked to Billy, who was staring at the dessert menu, his eyes glazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we get that dessert then?” she suggested in an attempt to distract him. Billy shook his head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not hungry,” he told her, before looking at his dad. “Why did you lie?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You said Agatha didn’t speak to her mom because she lived far away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She does,” Jeff insisted. “Her and your mom are from Cleveland, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Cleveland? Rio tucked that information away for later.
    </p>
<p>
     “But that isn’t the reason they don’t talk, is it?” Billy accused. “I’m not stupid. I saw how she looked at Rio, too. She’s homophobic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her tongue. He had much worse words to describe that woman, but they weren’t appropriate for adult ears, let alone a kid’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha didn’t want you to get upset,” his dad told him. “It happened and she’s fine now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She was having another panic attack,” Billy argued. “She hasn’t had one of those for ages!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. How often did these happen?
    </p>
<p>
     “Those weren’t about...”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I know,” Billy dismissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your aunt is pretty strong,” Rio added. “But she can’t be strong all the time. No one is.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not even you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Okay, maybe just me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy laughed weakly. “Did you know? About Agatha’s mom, I mean.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I only found out a few days ago,” Rio said. “I don’t know everything, but I know enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Was it bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Jeff, who shrugged defeatedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” she answered honestly. “But she survived, and she’s here and she has people who love her so much. That woman is nothing to her anymore. Just a sad old woman who will die alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked over to where Evanora sat, laughing with a woman of a similar age. “She doesn’t seem so lonely.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared over at them. There was no way that woman was leaving with a smile on her face. She would make sure of that.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you love her?” Billy asked. “Like
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     love her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy...” Jeff warned.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, it’s fine.” Rio gave Billy a warm smile. “I need to tell your aunt the answer to that first, don't you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy smiled and nodded in agreement, before looking to his dad again. “Sorry your birthday meal got ruined.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It didn’t get ruined,” Jeff assured. “I wanted family time, and that’s what I got. Maybe a bit too much family for one evening, but beggars can’t be choosers.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Rebecca returned, she looked shaken, and Rio’s worry intensified when she saw she was alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Agatha?” she and Billy asked at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     “In my car,” Rebecca answered. “We’re going to take her home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll go pay,” Jeff said.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I will,” Rio insisted. “You guys need to get her away from here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, that’s a lot…”
    </p>
<p>
     She shrugged. “I’m not as broke as I look.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff gave her a half hug and Billy gave her a full one, before they both headed out, leaving Rio and Rebecca alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can take you home, too,” Rebecca insisted. “It’s no bother.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’ll stay,” she looked over to where Evanora and her dinner companion were looking over the bill. “Unfinished business.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca followed her gaze, before looking to Rio with understanding. “Come round for dinner with Agatha some time this week. I’ll want to know everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     They gave each other a knowing nod before Rebecca headed out after her family.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went up to the bar and paid for their table, all the while watching as Evanora slipped on her coat, hugged her friend goodbye, and headed for the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she was right on her tail.
    </p>
<p>
     She caught up with her just down the street. Agatha’s mother seemed unfazed by the evenings events. In fact, she had a smug spring in her step that made Rio want to
    </p>
<p>
     “Evanora.”
    </p>
<p>
     The woman stopped and turned to face her, her surprise hidden behind a smug smile. A smug smile that thankfully didn’t resemble Agatha’s in the slightest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, well. If it isn’t my daughter’s latest whore. Or is it the other way round?”
    </p>
<p>
     It took all Rio’s strength not to smack her. “We need to talk?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did Agatha send you?” Evanora questioned. “She’s always been a coward. Always running away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s not a coward.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And defensive. My daughter must have you under a spell. She does that. Her grandmother was like it, too. Witches, the pair of them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped closer to her. “Evanora, the only reason you’re not on the floor right now is because I adore your daughter, and I don’t want to cause any more trouble for her. So I will tell you this only once. You will stay away from us. You will not come back to this city. You won’t even think of Agatha again. You won’t try and contact her and when you die, you make sure everything is settled because if it was up to me, I’d have you put in the trash. You’re not ruining her life ever again and if I ever see even a glimpse of your face, you’ll regret it. Do you understand me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Empty threats,” Evanora scoffed. “What could you possibly do to me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward and whispered in her ear. “I’m an expert in poisonous plants. I know their affects, how they work, how much they hurt. I see you again and I’ll make sure you die the most slow, horrific death in human history. And if that doesn’t finish you off, my roommate has a vast collection of kitchen knives. She won’t notice one going missing.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back to see the woman’s reaction and saw the smugness had disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you understand me now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good. Now go.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sight of Evanora Harkness fleeing her presence was incredibly satisfying, and Rio allowed herself a wicked smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     A smirk that disappeared the moment she turned around and saw who was standing a few feet away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her face was stained with tears and speckles of tried mascara, and her hair dishevelled. Even so, she was still the most beautiful thing Rio had ever seen.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted to say goodbye,” Agatha said, her voice unreadable.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, fuck, fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio avoided Agatha’s gaze. “How much of that did you hear?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer. She just started walking forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio braced herself. For whatever Agatha would say, what she would do. Though nothing could have prepared her for Agatha’s actions.
    </p>
<p>
     Soft hands held Rio’s face, guiding her as Agatha brought their lips together.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t a gentle kiss. Agatha captured her lips with such ferocity that it took Rio a moment to catch up. But she did. Her hands slip up to cup Agatha’s cheeks as she sunk into the kiss, enjoying a moment of pure relief, before pressing forward with everything she had.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s tongue grazed her lip, asking permission to enter, and Rio waited no time letting her in. The sensation of Agath’s tongue against hers was unlike anything she had ever experienced. Her hands moved to cling to Agatha’s arms, the only thing stopping her from flying away as her nose bumped against the other woman’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t sure where she ended and Agatha began. She didn’t care. She would give her mind, body and soul to her if it meant the kiss never ended. A kiss so molten it had fried ever nerve-ending in her body. A kiss that made her knees weak. A kiss that pooled a desperate warmth between her legs. A kiss that had ruined her for anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha pulled away, the kiss ending as abruptly as it began.
    </p>
<p>
     They stared at each other for a moment, and Agatha’s thumb brushed her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “I-I have to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and watched dumbly as Agatha race off back down the street. She blinked, bringing herself down to earth enough to string together a coherent thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She licked her lips, savouring Agatha’s lingering taste.
    </p>
<p>
     They had crossed a line, and there was no going back.
    </p>

<div>
<p>
     Rio was freaking out.
    </p>
<p>
     She had sent Agatha two texts when she got home night, and three when she got up ridiculously early the next morning. Still, as she finished her breakfast smoothie (blueberry for a change) she’d heard nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to give her space,” Lilia told her. “Last night will have been a big shock for her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just need to know she’s okay.” Rio checked her lock screen again and took the chance to stare at Agatha’s smiling face staring back at her. She needed to know Agatha was okay, then she needed to know that
     <em>
      they
     </em>
     were okay. The kiss had been earth-shattering, but emotions had been high, and she knew Agatha had a tendency to freak out when things got too real. But that had been before. Surely things had changed, right?
    </p>
<p>
     “I still can’t believe you said that to her mother,” Lilia said with a snort of laughter. “I wish I could have seen her face.”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as she stays away from Agatha, I’m happy to never think of that woman again,” Rio stated. “She’s the past.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you and her are the future?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her phone again. “I sure hope so.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you call her?” Lilia suggested. “Meet up, talk, and finally fuck each other’s brains out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia Calderu!” Rio gasped in mock horror. “That was pure filth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You two have driven me to this,” her roommate accused, before pulling out her tarot cards. “Let’s see. Are Rio and Agatha going to have sex anytime soon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you using them as a Magic 8 ball now?” Rio quipped, but Lilia still shuffled away. She lay down three cards and turned over the first.
    </p>
<p>
     “The past card. The reversed King of Cups. Suggests a lack of trustworthiness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered this. Not long ago, she wouldn’t have trusted Agatha as far as she could throw her, but things had changed. Yes, Agatha had lied, but in the past few weeks they had built something more. Something that made Rio almost not care about the note or lack thereof. Almost. A part of her still wanted that apology, even if her heart was too gone for it to make any difference.
    </p>
<p>
     “The present.” Lilia turned over the next. “The Queen of Wands. You need to be assertive in what you want, in order to get,” Lilia turned the last card, “the future.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the card. In it was a depiction of two adults embracing as children danced beside them. From the way she was looking at it, the two figures looked like total lesbians.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia smiled. “The Ten of Cups.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What does that mean?” Rio asked, and Lila shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “It means I think you need to try calling your girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried calling. She tried calling over and over all morning, but the call just kept ringing out. In the end, she had to go to class, even though that was the last place she wanted to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Sat in the lecture theatre with the masters students going over a recently submitted report on the rise of spotted water hemlock in Florida, she kept her phone on the desk beside her notebook. Each time her phone lit up, she scrambled to look in case it was Agatha, but it never was. Just emails and app notifications. Each more disappointing that the last.

     Just as they were discussing the possible correlation between the rise in plants and the changing climate (which usually ended in the good ol’ climate change debate), she got two more notifications.

     Rio frowned and opened the first post. It was one of the selfies he had taken with her the night before, while they were all still enjoying themselves. The photo made her smile, and she quickly screenshot it for her camera roll, making sure to keep the caption.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      name a more iconic duo than a gay and his gay aunt’s gay girlfriend
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Shaking her head at his antics, she opened up the other post. She had her suspicions what it would be, and she was correct. It was one of the shots from the impromptu photoshoot he had done of her and Agatha. They were good photos; she would give the kid that. She looked good, but of course the camera loved Agatha the most. Her hair, her face, that dress. She was a goddess that Rio couldn’t wait to worship.
    </p>
<p>
     Unlike the last caption, this one wasn’t so light:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      sometimes people can be cruel and hateful, and it can be hard being openly out when there are people like that in the world. that is why having my aunt and her awesome gf in my life is the greatest gift, along with two super supportive parents. they show me that being myself is okay, and that it’s always best to stand up to the bully than letting them stand on you. aunt agatha, you’re my role model, and rio, i can’t wait until the day i get to call you my aunt too.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was total cheese, but Rio still felt tears tickling at her eyes. She was starting to really like that kid.
    </p>
<p>
     She slipped her phone under the desk and texted Alice.

</p>
<p>

      Sure!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She half listened to the rest of the lecture and raced out when she was done. As she walked out of the building, she saved Sharon’s number and swiftly dialled it. The call picked up after two rings.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha Harkness’s office. Sharon speaking. How can I help?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey Sharon, it’s Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh hello sweetie! What can I help you with?” “
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Is Agatha in her office? She’s not replying to my calls.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yes, she’s here. Has something happened? She cancelled all her meetings and she’s barely eaten anything.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Shit. “I’m on my way!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the subway and sprinted the block to Agatha’s office, stopping off at a deli on the way to grab some sandwiches. She raced across the lobby and managed to squeeze into an elevator before the doors shut, jabbing the floor number she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator was full of nervous looking assistants dressed to the nines. All except a redhead, who was in all black besides a scarlet leather jacket. The woman looked her up and down.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you should leave take-out deliveries at the front desk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not…” She looked down at the wrapped subs in her hands and realised the mistake. “I’m going to see my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” The woman smiled. “That’s sweet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she’s stressed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She would be working in that office,” the woman said with a chuckle. “I like your hoodie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down. It was Agatha’s old hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks. It’s my favourite.”
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator doors opened, and the woman stepped out of the elevator. She gave Rio a smile before the doors closed.
    </p>
<p>
     Shrugging off the encounter, Rio watched the display count up the floors before it finally reached Agatha’s. The moment the doors slid open, she shot out and across the office, ignoring the curious heads popping up as she went.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon was sat at her desk, doing something on her computer. When she saw Rio approach, she smiled with clear relief.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s still in there, honey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks. Can you make sure no one comes in?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No one will get past me,” Sharon assured. “I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a thankful smile before pushing open the door to the office.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sat at her desk, and after a moment’s confusion, she looked around and saw her laid out on the couch with her laptop resting on her stomach. She peered over the screen, only to quickly slam it shut when she saw who it was. “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped the sandwiches on the coffee table and stood before her, hands crossed. “So you’re not dead then?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dead?” Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve texted you. I’ve called you. I had to get Alice to get Jen to get her to send Alice your assistants phone number so I could find out if you were here and not dead in a dumpster. What the hell, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio. I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No Agatha. I get that you’re upset after last night, but you don’t get to do that. I can’t stand the silent treatment when you decide this is too much. You kissed me last night, and you were the one that planned to talk about what we are, so you can damn well face the consequences. I’m so sick of you backstepping every time we get close to something real. Because this isn’t fake anymore. Not for me anyway, and I…”
    </p>
<p>
     The door to the office opened, and Sharon’s apologetic face appeared. “Agatha, Phil from IT is here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha put her laptop aside, but didn’t sit up. “Send him in.”
    </p>
<p>
     The IT guy with the stupid mustache shuffled into the room, holding an iPhone box in one hand, and a smashed phone in the other. He walked over and handed both to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I managed to transfer everything over for you, Miss Harkness. I put your new phone back in the box for safety.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent, thank you Phil.”
    </p>
<p>
     Phil gave Rio a cautious glance before retreating, shutting the door behind him.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the items in Agatha’s hands, who held up the smashed one for her to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “Turns out smashing your phone is contagious.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her right trouser leg to reveal a blackening bruise. “To put the cherry on top, I tripped getting out of Rebecca’s car last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine. My phone took most of the damage.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran a stressed hand through her hair. “So you weren’t avoiding me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio. I was not avoiding you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Rio’s shoulders slumped. She was an idiot. “Agatha, I’m so sorry. I just assumed the worst and, I don’t know, I was so scared you’d got home last night and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?” Agatha interrupted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked back at her nervously. “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just shut up and kiss me.”
    </p>
<p>
     It took her brain a beat to comprehend Agatha’s words, but the moment it clicked, Rio threw off her bookbag and shot over to her. She sat on the edge of the couch as Agatha sat up. Her hand reached out to her face, her fingers tracing the line of Agatha’s jaw. Then, embodying the Queen of Cups, she kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     The kiss was gentler than the one the night before. Soft and sweet, but it set Rio completely ablaze. The smell of Agatha’s perfume filled her nostrils, and as Agatha opened her mouth and nipped her bottom lip, something snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     She moved to straddle Agatha’s waist, and leaned down to press their chests together before kissing her with such fire in made her toes curl. Agatha’s hands cradled the back of her head, kissing her back just as feverishly. Fuck, she felt so good.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought she’d never survive this. It was so intense, so molten. Beyond anything the human body was capable of enduring. But she didn’t care. If this was how she died, she’d gladly welcome it. All she wanted was to kiss Agatha a little while longer.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips, however, had a mind of their own and took a journey along Agatha’s jaw and down her throat. The perfume was stronger there, and Rio couldn’t help but suck and bite at the skin offered stretch of skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned, the sound vibrating against her lips. “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes gorgeous?” she murmured against her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re in my office.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And if we carry on, I could potentially have a HR complaint on my hands.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked on her pulse point. “I don’t work for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but I don’t want the people who do to hear you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, looking down at her with a cocky smile. “How do you know I’ll be the noisy one?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked right back up at her. “Oh honey, you will definitely be loud.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned and rested her face in Agatha’s neck. “You have no idea what you’re doing to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have some idea,” Agatha chuckled, kissing the top of her head. “So you brought sandwiches?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Sharon said you hadn’t eaten.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I haven’t been hungry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you are now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “Well I can’t have the other thing I’m desperately craving, so food will do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned again and reluctantly got up to retrieve the sandwiches.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are they?” Agatha asked as she accepted the one Rio handed her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know what you liked so I got chopped cheese,” Rio said, sitting back down as close to Agatha as she could. “It’s my favourite.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re kidding?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why, don’t you like it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I love it. It’s my favourite too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, and Rio stole a quick kiss before unwrapping her sandwich.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Rio began between bites, “let’s talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded as she finished chewing. Once she was done, she put her sandwich in her lap and looked at Rio like she was the only person in the world. “You’ve kind of told me how you feel, so I think it’s only fair that I’m honest about how I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, Feeling more than a little nervous.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a deep breath. “I’m not good at this. I…I always thought I was too broken to build anything meaningful with anyone. My high school relationship was all self-discovery, and my college relationship was an extension of the same. I dated a woman for a year in my late twenties, but we could never get beyond that casual dating phase, so we called it quits. Then Wanda was fine. It ended badly, but the relationship itself was fine. We had fun, but we never…I’ve never had whatever this is between us before.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I miss you when you’re not here. I grin like a lovestruck idiot whenever you text me. I think about you all the time. I get distracted at work because all I’m thinking about is what you’re doing or when I’m next going to hear from you. When I see you, I feel my whole body light up. When you smile at me, I get butterflies. And when you stare at me with those big brown eyes, it’s like the whole world just fades away. It’s exciting Rio, but it’s also
     <em>
      terrifying.
     </em>
     I tried to stop this when I felt we were getting too deep, but now I can’t. And I’m scared because if we go wrong, I-I don’t know how I’m going to live without you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared back at her. Holy shit, was that real or was she in some kind of dream?
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Agatha prompted. “What do you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I say you don’t have to worry because I’m so…I’m sure if you looked in my mind, you’d be scared by how obsessed I am with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded with a grin. “You’re all I think about. I’ll be watching Housewives with Lilia and I’ll think ‘Agatha would find that funny’ and I’ll be in class and some jerk with say something and I’ll wonder what you’d say to put him in his place. And I get the being worried. If I’m being honest, this is the longest relationship I’ve ever had. I’ve always freaked people out in some way, and I accepted I was just an unlovable weirdo. Then I meet you, and I began to think maybe I wasn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re far from unlovable,” Agatha insisted. “How can anyone spend time with you and think you’re not amazing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned towards her. “Well I don’t want any other woman thinking I’m amazing ever again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn right.” Agatha pecked her lips quickly. “You’re mine now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re mine.” Rio leaned in and gave her a long kiss. “So can we officially drop the fake out of fake girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we need to go on some actual dates first,” Agatha suggested. “I think we owe each other that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reluctantly had to agree. She wanted that stage with Agatha too. “Okay, does right now count?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then when is date number two?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “So eager.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Can’t blame a girl for wanting to lock in the local goddess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay. Well I can’t meet tonight. I promised Billy I’d call him. He wants to talk about my mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guessed he would.” Rio reached out to take her hand. “Need some moral support?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I need to face this myself but thank you.” Agatha squeezed her hand. “How about tomorrow? Dinner? I’ll cook.”
    </p>
<p>
     “At your apartment?” Rio questioned. “That could be dangerous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “I like danger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to kiss her face off, but instead she steered the conversation back into safer waters. “Billy put some photos on Instagram. Kid almost wrote an essay under the one of you and me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for the iPhone box and pulled out her new phone. Tapping away, Rio watched her log into Instagram and find Billy’s profile. She expected Agatha to go for the one of them both, but her thumb quickly selected the selfie instead. She smiled at the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh I love this so much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, kid is good at selfies.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha set her phone aside and kissed her cheek. “We need to eat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and took a bite out of sandwich, trying hard to kick her feet like an excited child.
    </p>
<p>
     Her not-so fake girlfriend Agatha Harkness. It had a nice ring to it.

     Agatha stared down at Rio, who laid out on the bed, propped up on her elbows and looking up at her through her long eyelashes. She was in her usual hoodie and jeans, but somehow still looked unbelievably hot.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’ve got me here,” Rio purred. “What are you going to do now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha climbed onto the bed and crawled over her. She leaned down and nipped Rio’s ear with her teeth before whispering, “I’m going to make you see stars, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back to look into Rio’s eyes, which were now dark with desire. Agatha leaned in and kissed her, reaching for the hem of Rio’s hoodie as eager hands clawed at her own shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio beat her to it, pulling the shirt over Agatha’s head, her hands instantly moving to touch her bra-covered breasts. She feathered kisses around the edge of the cups. “Fuck, you’re sexy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I am,” Agatha smirked. “What I want to see is what you have hiding under here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reluctantly leaned back and held up her arms, fluttering her eyelashes. “Whatever you want, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha woke up with a groan. She had overslept and had been awoken by her in-case-of-emergency alarm. She sat up to switch it off, before flopping back into the pillows.
    </p>
<p>
     Thursday.
    </p>
<p>
     She hated Thursdays.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was younger, she was sent to a church group on Thursday evenings, and she’d hated every moment of it. They had to study the bible and talk over and over about what was sinful and what wasn’t. All the while she was thinking about the Jodie Foster poster she had on her bedroom wall.
    </p>
<p>
     When she moved in with her dad, she had therapy on a Thursday, and a tutor after school to try bridge the gap in her reading and spelling. Since then, Thursdays had always left a sour taste in her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     This Thursday, however, had promise to change her opinion forever. Rio was coming over for dinner. An actual date, though what had they been kidding. Every ‘date’ had been real; they just chose to deny it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was done with denying.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting up, she went through her morning routine before heading in the kitchen to make breakfast. As she did, she checked the cupboards. Pasta, check. Tinned tomatoes, check. Cheese, check. She just needed a handful of ingredients that she could easily pick up on the way home, and her grandmother’s signature pasta would be ready to go.
    </p>
<p>
     She fed Senõr Scratchy and fixed herself a bowl of cereal, before sitting down at her table. Chewing a spoonful of cereal, she opened her chat with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was on a study day, so wouldn’t be up for a while. Still, a good morning text was always nice to wake up to.

     Rio didn’t reply for a minute or so, and Agatha finished off her coffee, wondering if she’d been too forward. Eventually though, a reply came.

     Agatha sighed. She totally did
    </p>
<p>
     They carried on texting until Agatha had to drive to work, and she decided to leave it be for a few hours.
    </p>
<p>
     While she could have talked with her all morning, Agatha knew Rio had to get on with her PhD work. It was important, and the last thing she wanted was to distract from that. Plus, she had a lot of meetings to make up for from the day before.
    </p>
<p>
     Her first meeting was a pleasant one: a skype call with the author of her newly acquired project. The author was relieved she had taken over, and Agatha enjoyed giving praise for once. The second, however, had been an update of profit margins that had Agatha almost falling asleep. She had to daydream to pretend she was interested, which of course ended up being about Rio and how she really wanted to finish her dream from that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she got back to her office, she was in need of some Rio time.

     Next thing, a photo came through. It was taken in a full-length mirror, likely Lilia’s, revealing Rio in her basketball vest and shorts.

     The response came quickly.

</p>
<p>
     All too soon, Agatha was forced to abandon the conversation to head to the next pointless meeting. The execs wanted to discuss everyone’s responsibilities heading into the next quarter. Perhaps she should have been more interested, but the only thing on her mind was Rio in her basketball outfit.
    </p>
<p>
     She could imagine her, sweating in the midday sun, the muscles in her arms rippling as she maneuverer around her opponent, how she jumped up to shoot her shot, her vest lifting to reveal the slightest glimpse of her stomach…
    </p>
<p>
     Her watch vibrated and she discreetly looked to see who it was. Messages appeared one after the other.
    </p>
<p>

      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio’s hurt!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She shot out of her chair and rushed out of the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Mike called after her as he followed her down the corridor.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to go,” she told him as she dialled Jen’s number.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, but I think my partner has been in an accident.”
    </p>
<p>
     The phone continued to ring out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, okay, shall we cancel the meeting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, just do whatever,” she dismissed as she tried to call Jen again. “I’m sorry Mike, I have to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, get out of here. Let me know how she is!”
    </p>
<p>
     She gave him a thankful smile before rushing to the stairs. The elevator would take too long. She rushed across her floor and into her office, ignoring Sharon’s questions as she went by. Agatha quickly gathered her things and was out the door again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon, tell anyone who wants anything that I won’t be available today.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will do, but are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Something has happened with Rio,” Agatha called back as she rushed to the elevator. “I need to go!”
    </p>
<p>
     As she climbed into the elevator, she tried calling Jen again. “Pick up, pick up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen answered on the fifth ring.
     <em>
      “Agatha?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Jen where are you?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “St John’s. They’ve just got Rio a bed in the ER.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “She took a bad tackle. Hit her head, but she’s really hurt her knee.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Shit.” Agatha recalled Rio telling her about her knee injury in college. She hoped this wasn’t as bad, or worse.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Are you coming?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Of course I am,” Agatha snapped. “I’m heading to my car now.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Okay, Rio will be happy. She’s been crying for you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Crying. Agatha felt tears welling in her eyes. She needed to get to the hospital. Now.
    </p>
<p>
     She may have broken some speeding laws, but she made it to the hospital in good time. All but abandoning her car in the hospital parking lot, Agatha ran into the ER. She looked around, frantic, but there was no sign of Rio, Alice or Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Miss, you need to sign in,” a nurse told her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m here to see my girlfriend,” Agatha replied. “I got told she was here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s her name?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri-“
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Jen rushed over to her. “There you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed her to a bay and found Alice helping Rio back into bed. Relief washed over her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t look as bad as she imagined. Her head was bruised not broken, and her knee wasn’t popping out of her leg like she envisioned. Still, it wasn’t a sight she wished to see again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face lit up when she saw her. “Hey you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly moved to help Rio fully settle against the hospital pillow. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, just been for an X Ray but,” Rio bent her knee, pressing her lips together but Agatha still heard her wince. “I think it’s just bruised.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll see about that,” Agatha commented, before kissing the top of her head. “What about that bump?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I bump my head all the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t like that answer. “How did you get an X-Ray so fast?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone,” Alice gave Jen a disapproving look, “told the doctor she had a rich girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Jen asked defensively. “She does!”
    </p>
<p>
     “They didn’t need to know that,” Alice argued. “Getting Rio preferential treatment is unethical.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not the one giving her it so why is that my problem?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you brought it up!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio winced. “Okay so my head still hurts, and your domestic isn’t helping.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry.” Alice rubbed Rio’s shoulder. “Next time we’re going to a rec centre. Those guys just wanted trouble.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked between them. “Which guys?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Some corporate types in suits,” Rio grumbled. “They saw us playing and started whistling.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clenched her fist.
    </p>
<p>
     “Total jerks,” Alice added. “So Rio thought it was a good idea to challenge them 2-v-2.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “Yeah, and we were totally creaming them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Until one of them knocked you over.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was an illegal move,” Rio insisted. “I was mid-jump, and he shoved me in the side. Like literally hands out pushed me. They ran off when they realised I was hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cowards.” Agatha got out her phone. “Did you see what company they worked for?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, Alice shook her head, but Jen had her phone out. “They left their lanyards on the bench next to me. It was something like Master and Greeney, Mister and Gregory.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Marston and Greenway?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Our offices are in the same building. Do you know their names?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio answered. “Look, they got bested by some girls and got mad. I’ll get my revenge next time
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     see them. I can fight my own battles.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha lied. She was not letting this go.
    </p>
<p>
     They waited for the doctor to come see them and he confirmed Rio’s knee was fine, just bruised, and after Agatha inspected the X ray herself, she allowed the diagnosis. He said there was no sign of concussion but said if anything changed to get back there ASAP.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha insisted that she take Rio home, and Alice reluctantly agreed, but insisted on calling later to check in. Taking gentle care on the drive, Agatha drove to Rio’s building, parking as close as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     She jumped out of the car and raced round to open the passenger door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re not now take my hand.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did that without hesitation and allowed Agatha to help her out of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lean on me,” she instructed, but Rio just walked along with the slightest limp.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said I’m fine, the doctor said I’m fine. I am fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed and hurried after her. This woman drove her crazy in every was possible.
    </p>
<p>
     The made it up to the apartment and found Lilia sat at the dining table. She looked at them both with a frown. “I thought you went out with Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s limp had gotten worse, and she hobbled over to the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I fell, everyone overreacted, and now I’m home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shook her head. “I told you to keep studying.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was done!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms. “We’re going to get you fitted for some protective gear.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I play basketball not hockey. I don’t need protection.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want you getting hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe, sometimes it’s worth the risk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Lilia, who waved to the seat in front of her. “Care for a reading?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned. “Do not give my girlfriend a reading, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, loving the sound of Rio saying ‘girlfriend’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on,” Lilia encouraged. “Humour me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Rio an apologetic look. “Sorry, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     She took the seat opposite Lilia and watched as the psychic began to shuffle the deck.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia placed three cards down. “Have you done this before?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “My college girlfriend used to dabble.”
    </p>
<p>
     That seemed to get Rio’s attention. She limped across the room and sat at the head of the table. “Lilia will give you a better reading.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a side glance before looking back to Lilia. “So, tell me what the future holds.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s start with the past.” Lilia turned over the card. “Three of Swords.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I always get that one,” Rio complained.
    </p>
<p>
     “Heartbreak, sorry, grief,” Lilia recited. Agatha had to agree. Her past had a lot of all three.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t change the past,” Lilia told her. “But we can do something about the present.” She turned over the next card. “Justice. Balance, fairness, and truth. You need to accept responsibility for your mistakes in order to get.” She turned the next card. “The future.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the card. Ten of cups.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you got the lesbian card too,” Rio commented.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “The lesbian card?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, don’t they look like total lesbians to you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up the card to get a closer look. “Huh, guess you’re right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So our future is lesbianism?” Rio asked Lilia, making Agatha laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honey, for me that’s past, present and future.” She tossed the card back on the table. “So, what’s my future?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia just shrugged. “You have to deal with the present before you can get there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She wouldn’t tell me either,” Rio complained. “I’ll just google it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Google won’t explain this specific reading,” Lilia reminded her. “Only I can do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever.” Rio looked to Agatha hopefully. “Are you done with work for the day?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am,” she confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well then shall I go get ready and we can head to yours?”
    </p>
<p>
     A part of Agatha screamed YES, YES, YES, but her logical mind said different. “I think we should rain check. You need to rest.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can rest at your place,” Rio argued, at which Lilia laughed. They both looked at her, and she rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not stupid. I know why she wants to go.” Lilia pointed at Rio. “And why you don’t.” She pointed at Agatha. “Usually, I’d be totally behind Rio’s cause, but you can barely walk let alone…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay.” Rio stopped her. “We could just have dinner though?”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I don’t want you overdoing yourself,” Agatha countered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then a compromise.” Lilia clapped her hands. “I will make you both my signature lasagne. You get to have dinner together, Rio stays put, and you get the added privilege of my company. Everyone wins.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rio, who shrugged. “Her lasagne is very good.”
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, Lilia’s lasagne was better than good. If Agatha wasn’t so horny, she’d say it made up for the lack of sex.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you have a restaurant?” Agatha asked her as she accepted a second helping. “This would have people queueing round the block.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shrugged. “I wouldn’t like the commitment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So she tells fortunes and sells leggings,” Rio jested. “I think she needs to team up with Sharon, the Baking God. They’d get a Michelin star in no time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I actually think they would,” Agatha admitted. “I think Sharon is baking me a cake. She keeps asking me about my favourite sponge and frosting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s sweet of her,” Lilia commented. “A special occasion?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha answered quickly, but Rio caught it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why is she baking you a cake?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’m an amazing boss?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia eyed her suspiciously. “It’s her birthday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha suddenly hated her with a passion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your birthday?!” Rio bounced in her chair. “When?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sunday...”
    </p>
<p>
     “THIS SUNDAY?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but it’s no big deal. I don’t really celebrate it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No big deal?! It’s my girlfriend’s birthday. How did I not know this? You know when mine is!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, because last night you wrote a full paragraph about your moon chart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now I’m going to write one about yours!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. This was total hell.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing for your birthday?” Lilia asked, bringing the conversation back to normal decibels.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing. I might go see my family, but just a normal Sunday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like hell it will be,” Rio commented. “I need to get planning!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you like the zoo?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or we could drive out somewhere. Oh, like the sea!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or do you want to have a cosy day? Because I think...”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia cleared her throat. “Rio, that is enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But...”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia raised her eyebrows and Rio looked at her plate like a scolded child. Agatha bit back a laugh. She was so adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     After dinner, Lilia announced she had a show she wanted to watch and ‘didn’t want their canoodling distracting her’. They instead lay on Rio’s bed watching a film on her new laptop. Agatha was curled up into Rio’s side, away from her bad knee, her head rested on her soon-to-be girlfriend’s shoulder. It was a strange position for her- usually she had been the make-shift pillow, even during her catholic school situationship. The strangest part was she kind of liked it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish you’d have told me it was your birthday,” Rio spoke up. “Now I have to rush getting you something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t need anything,” Agatha assured. “Just you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re cute, but no. I already have some ideas.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just don’t spend too much money,” Agatha pleaded.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not entirely broke. My stepmom was a famous rockstar, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, sorry, money bags.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just want to make it special.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you’re like my favourite person at the minute.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her. “Just at the minute?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “We’ll see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted up and kissed Rio softly. It had been over twenty-four hours since they last kissed, and Agatha hoped she’d never have to wait that long again. They stayed lazily kissing for a while, slowly allowing it to grow in intensity. They’d forgotten about the movie, forgotten that Lilia was in the next room, forgotten about…
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly pulled back. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, just my knee.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to sit up. “I think you need to put ice on it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, come back,” Rio whined as she tried to drag Agatha back down. “Stay tonight. Lilia won’t mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Senõr Scratchy needs feeding,” Agatha remined her. “And you need to rest.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I want you here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at Rio sadly and reached out to tuck a stary strand of hair behind her ear. “Rio, tonight isn’t the night.”
    </p>
<p>
     She hated the sadness that crossed Rio’s face. “I know, but I wish it was.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed a kiss to her cheek. “We can’t plan stuff like this. It’ll happen, and once it’s happened, I’m sure we’ll make up for lost time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh definitely,” Rio grinned wickedly. “I hope you can put on a good sick voice, because you’re going to need it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m sure.” Agatha kissed Rio sweetly before climbing off the bed. “Now I need to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you must.” Rio sighed dramatically. “Leave your girl here injured and wanton.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll survive,” Agatha assured her. “I’ll call you tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Will I see you?” Rio asked hopefully, and Agatha had to lean down and kiss her again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll make sure of it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed the top of Rio’s head before making her way to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hate it when you leave but love it when you walk away,” Rio called after her, and Agatha gave her the middle finger before shutting the bedroom door. She walked by Lilia, careful to keep away from the TV.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she needs space to rest.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia nodded in understanding. “Next date you two go on I don’t want to see her for at least two days after.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll see what I can do,” Agatha replied as she gathered her things. At this rate, Lilia wouldn’t see Rio a full week.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha made it back to her apartment, fed and cuddled Senõr Scratchy, then got herself settled in bed with her book.
    </p>
<p>
     This one was a sapphic romance. Thus far it had been cute, but she had gotten to the part where the love interest had the main character pinned up against a door, three fingers deep, and Agatha cursed everything. Still, she read on, biting her lip as the scene grew in intensity.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as the main character was reaching her peak, her phone beeped. Agatha huffed and tossed the book aside in frustration, only to perk up when she saw it was Rio.
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Can’t sleep,”
     </em>
     Rio admitted.
     <em>
      “Alice text me asking if we wanted to meet her and Jen at the bar tomorrow. You in?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, but can you manage…”

<p>
<em>
      “Agatha, I’ll be fine in the morning. Maybe a little stiff, but I bounce back quick.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m sure,” Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What you doing?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Reading in bed.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Read to me?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “I’m not reading this to you.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Why? What is it?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Nothing interesting. Just some…romance novel.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cackled.
     <em>
      “Agatha Harkness, are you reading a dirty book?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s not that dirty,” Agatha stated. “Just the part I’m currently reading.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “No fair. You leave me here all hot and bothered while you’re enjoying your book geek porn at home.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s not porn, it’s literature.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Whatever. I guess I’ll just have to use my imagination instead.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed her thighs together. “And what would be happening in your imagination?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You, me, your bed, and the three T’s.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “The three T’s?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Tips, tongues and toys.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What was that dream about that had you all flustered this morning?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m sure you can guess.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’m sure I can. Tell me anyway.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. What the hell. “You were laid on my bed, still in your jeans and hoodie, and I was stood over you.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What were you wearing?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. A shirt. Definitely a shirt.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Sexy. Go on?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You asked what I was going to do now I had you here, and I crawled over you.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “And bit your ear.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Fuck, that’s hot.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “And I promised you I’d make you see stars.”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Rio groan.
     <em>
      “Then what?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “We kissed, and we started reaching for each other’s shirts.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Please tell me I got your shirt off.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you kissed along the edge of my bra.”
    </p>
<p>
     Another groan
     <em>
      . “I can’t wait to see you in a bra. I bet they’re all fancy.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Fancy bras turn you on?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “On hot women, yeah. Carry on.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I said I wanted to see what you had hiding under your hoodie.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “And you raised your arms, told me I could have whatever I wanted.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yeah?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “And then I woke up.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Fuck sake, Agatha!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey, imagine how I fel- wait, were you jacking off to that?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “No.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Okay fine, but I’m horny as hell and that was hot.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha considered her options. She could tease Rio silly, she could tell her to try get some sleep and end the call, or she could do what the heat between her legs were begging her to do.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid a hand into her pyjama pants, and groaned as her fingers touched her now overly sensitive bundle of nerves.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “If I didn’t wake up, I would have pulled off your hoodie and kissed all over your chest, before taking your nipple in my mouth.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Fuck, are you-”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand moved feverishly, her eyes clenched shut. “I’d go from right, then to left, then trail kisses down your stomach.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moaned.
     <em>
      “Yeah baby. God, I’d be arching into your touch, running my hands through your hair.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I’d get to the edge of your jeans, and I’d have to sit up to unbutton them, but I’d pull them off you quick. No underwear, so you’d just laid there. Bare to me. So beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’d be looking up at you,”
     </em>
     Rio said breathlessly.
     <em>
      “I’d be so ready for you. I’d just want you to take me.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I would be able to see how much you want me. I’d want nothing more than to get my head between your legs, but I’d want us to touch completely. I’d want to melt our bodies together.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’d sit up and help take your bra off. I’d have to touch you. Palm you in my hands.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha put Rio on speaker and used her now free hand to cup her breast.
    </p>
<p>
     “While you played, I’d take of my pants, then my panties. Then I’d push you back and shove my thigh between your legs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s moan was louder this time.
     <em>
      “God yes. Please Agatha. Grind against me.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I’d thrust against you. Slow at first, then faster and hard. I’d bite and lick your neck while I grab your tit and roll the nipple between my fingers.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Fuck!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You close baby?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yes!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Me too. Just keep going honey. God, I know you’d feel so good against me, so hot, so responsive.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha! I-oh god, oh god.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, Rio. Fuck, come on, come on.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’m-”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio-”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s world turned molten as she arched her back off the mattress, crying out into the night, the sound mingling with the sound of Rio’s own release. It took her a while to float back down, until the only sound was two heavy breaths caught in uneven rhythms.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh fuck,”
     </em>
     Rio gasped for air.
     <em>
      “Lilia definitely heard that.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Next time we’ll be here, and we can be as loud as we like.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Is that a promise?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love,” Agatha swore. “I promise.”

     Agatha woke up at the first sight of sun, her eyes squinting in the near dark, only to smile when she remembered the events of the night before.  Her body buzzed at the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     How could one phone call be better than most of the sexual experiences she’d ever had? She wasn’t sure she was ready to experience the real thing, but she also couldn’t wait.
    </p>
<p>
     Checking her phone, she smiled at her new lockscreen photo. She’d asked Billy to send her all his photos from Jeff’s meal. He probably expected she wanted the one of her and Rio for a wallpaper, but how could she when she had a selfie of her two favourite people ready and waiting? Seeing them both together made her heart flutter, and she couldn’t wait to have them both with her again.
    </p>
<p>
     She sent Rio a good morning text and carried on with her routine. She knew Rio wouldn’t be up for hours, but she wanted to show she was thinking about her. Because she was. All the time.
    </p>
<p>
     Since she was up earlier than the day before, Agatha decided to have some Senõr Scratchy cuddle time. She took a photo of him and sent it to Rio, then a selfie of them both for good measure.
    </p>
<p>
     She got a reply as she was walking into her office.

     Sharon shuffled into the office then. Agatha looked up at her and her smile dropped. Her assistant’s usual bright smile was replaced by tired eyes and a face etched with sadness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got up and walked over to her. “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon burst into tears and threw herself into Agatha’s arms. “He didn’t love me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha awkwardly patted her back as she cried. “Who didn’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My Todd,” Sharon sobbed. “I found letters he wrote, and printed emails. He was seeing another woman the entire time we were married.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wrapped a protective arm around her. If the man wasn’t already dead, she’d be on her way to make sure he was.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did I do wrong?” Sharon asked. “I could have been more attentive, maybe…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did nothing wrong,” Agatha insisted. “That man is worth no more of your time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He took all of my time,” Sharon said sadly. “I’m…”
    </p>
<p>
     “A beautiful mature woman in need of a good time,” Agatha told her. “It’s my birthday at the weekend. How about we go out Saturday night? I’ll get the girls together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back and put her hands on her shoulders. “Trust me. You’ll be okay. When my ex cheated on me, I thought that was that. Now I’ve met the person,..” She quickly stopped herself. “I’ve met someone who makes me happier than she ever did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a lot older than you…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Age is but a number. And anyway, nothing will make you feel young like a night on the town. What do you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped away and folded her arms. “As your boss, I’m requiring you to accompany me for drinks with my friends.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon sighed. “Fine, I’ll come.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled victoriously. “Excellent. I’ll message you the details and arrange a car to come get you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll be all, Sharon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded, wiping her cheeks and leaving the room with her head higher than when she entered.

     Agatha smiled as she replied.
    </p>
<p>

     </strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looked at herself in the mirror. Her planned outfit was now reserved for Agatha’s last-minute birthday bash, so she brought out something new. Something that should have been worn before, but she had done something stupid and almost lost everything.
    </p>
<p>
     This time she wouldn’t be so foolish.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking to the bar, she quickly spotted her pretty-much-almost-most-definitely-but-not-quite girlfriend. Agatha was sat with her back to her beside Jen. It seemed they were switching up the seating arrangements, but Rio was fine with that. It meant she’d have a gorgeous view of her girl all night. How could she complain about that?
    </p>
<p>
     Alice saw her first and smiled. “Here she is!”
    </p>
<p>
     Both Agatha and Jen turned in unison, and Rio relished in the way Agatha’s eyes widened.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen whistled. “Wow, green looks good on you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Rio walked by Agatha, brushing her hand across her shoulder as she went. “It’s also my favourite colour.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mine now too,” Agatha commented, smiling at Rio with adoration. “Especially when she’s wearing that suit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat down opposite Alice and reached over for Agatha’s hand. “It was a gift from my gorgeous girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Agatha take a sip of her drink, but Rio still saw her blush.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two are sickly,” Jen commented. “I thought people moved out of the honeymoon phase, but you just seem to get worse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio shared knowing smiles.
    </p>
<p>
     “See! Please say you’ve had sex already.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s none of your business,” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a no then,” Jen snarked. “You know waiting isn’t going to make it any better. Premature ejaculation is a thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took another sip of her drink, and Rio couldn’t help herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as it’s on me, I don’t care.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chocked on her drink, while Alice laughed, and Jen covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, you can’t just say that!” Jen scolded.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were the one who brought up ejaculation.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we please stop saying that word,” Agatha grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I second that,” Alice added, looking at Jen disapprovingly. “I expect this from my sister, but not you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen clicked her tongue. “Well, I can’t believe you guys are going out on the town without me tomorrow. Couldn’t we have done that tonight instead?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s just to cheer up my assistant,” Agatha insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “And to celebrate your birthday,” Rio added. “And don’t think a hangover is stopping your actual birthday extravaganza, because it’s not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a disapproving look, which Rio of course relished.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s up with your assistant?” Alice asked. “I hope she’s okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swirled her drink in her glass. “She found out her husband cheated on her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “Isn’t he dead?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, she found letters in his things. He’d been seeing someone else the whole time. While she was raising his kids and making a home, he was making his bed with someone else.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clenched her jaw. She fucking hated cheaters.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the fuck?” Jen sat up straight. “I wish I could cancel my trip. This woman needs to get laid ASAP.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen,” Alice scolded.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a grandmother,” Agatha stated, but Jen shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “She still needs to get laid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we’re bringing Lilia, so she doesn’t feel too intimidated,” Rio told them. “Though I think she’ll end up getting Sharon to join her psychic circle or something weird. She tried that with me, but none of her friends liked me that much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How come?” Agatha questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “I played an innocent prank…”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice let out a sharp laugh. “You threw your tarantula’s old exoskeleton at them. Those poor women nearly had a heart attack.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cackled and clapped her hands. “Oh that sounds hilarious.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was.” Rio grinned at the memory. “They all screamed.”
    </p>
<p>
     The server arrived to take their order, a young woman with a shaggy mullet. Rio watched her eyes circle round the table before landing on Agatha. Because of course they did. She was a walking sapphic fantasy. Didn’t mean Rio had to like it though.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I get you guys anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think we’re ready to order food yet,” Agatha answered, before holding up her glass. “But can I get another one of these.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, why don’t you come up to the bar with me and I’ll make it for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to answer, but Rio butted in. “Isn’t it your job to bring the drinks to us?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice elbowed her in the side as the server looked at her in surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Erm, yes, sorry. I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I would like the same as my girlfriend,” Rio told her, setting the record straight (in a gay way). “Or maybe we could get a bottle to share. What do you say, sweetheart?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at her. “Whatever you want, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled back at her, only to drop it when she looked back to the server. “You got that?”
    </p>
<p>
     The server nodded and scurried away. Alice slapped Rio’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were so rude!” Alice scolded. “That poor woman was only…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Checking out my girlfriend,” Rio huffed. “No one does that but me!”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed. “Please, everyone checks Agatha out. You’d have to literally fight off everyone on the planet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If that’s what it takes.” Rio looked to Agatha and saw she was watching her, her blue eyes darker than usual. She tilted her head, and watched as Agatha downed the rest of her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you have to say about this?” Jen asked Agatha, who smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip, trying not to laugh when her sister and Jen made sounds of disgust. Her eyes met Agatha’s again, both staring at the other deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     Desire coursed through Rio’s veins. She wished they were at Agatha’s apartment, alone (besides Senõr Scratchy), staring across the dining table. There, she could lean over, give Agatha the dirtiest kiss of her life, before taking her right there on the rug.
    </p>
<p>
     Throwing caution to the wind, she stretched her foot out and rubbed it against Agatha’s carf. It was a simple gesture, could be thrown away as an accident, but in this context, it made her intentions perfectly clear.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha jumped to her feet, Rio knew she’d made a mistake.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to go to the bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her retreat through the restaurant towards the ladies room. Dammit, not again.
    </p>
<p>
     She excused herself also and weaved through the tables to get to the bathroom. Pushing the door open, she found Agatha leaned against the sink. Just like last time. Only this time, Rio didn’t want to mess with her. She wanted to make things right.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m sorry. I got carried away, I promise…”
    </p>
<p>
     The next thing Rio knew, she was pressed up against the bathroom door, Agatha’s lips latched onto her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have no idea how fucking hot that was,” Agatha spoke against her skin, the vibration making Rio throw her head back. “I wanted to throw you on the floor and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Rio spoke breathlessly, one hand clutching the door while the other grasped the back of Agatha’s head. “The way you looked at me…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back, only to kiss her lips with burning desire. Rio moaned into her mouth, kissing her back with the same passion. Kissing Agatha was like drinking moonlight, and she couldn’t quench her thirst.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s right hand gripped harder on her waist, while her left slid downward, cupping Rio through her trousers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped against her mouth, her hand tightening in Agatha’s hair. “Fuck!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed against her lips. “No underwear. Very dangerous, Miss Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only when I’m around you,” Rio answered. “You make me feel like a teenage boy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s get out of here.” Agatha pulled back and held out her hand. “I can’t wait anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t hesitate. She took Agatha’s hand and let her weave them through the sea of tables back to their own, let her make their excuses to leave, let her lead them outside into the crisp evening air. Let her hail a cab and pull her into the back seat, giving her address to the driver between kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon they were at Agatha’s apartment building. Agatha paid the driver and dragged Rio inside and towards the elevator. She pressed the button for her floor and, as soon as the door shut, she pressed Rio against the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gripped her shoulders as Agatha attached herself to her neck again. “Are you trying to mark me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just love this damn neck so much,” Agatha admitted before sucking on another piece of skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Need I remind you we’re meeting our friends tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have good concealer,” Agatha told her. “And a whisk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t argue with her anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     When they made it to her floor, Agatha grasped her hand and rushed them down the corridor. Rio couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, but she wasn’t going to stop. She wanted Agatha too damn bad to care.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scrambled to get her door unlocked, and when she did, she kicked it open to let them in, and slammed it shut behind them. It gave Rio enough time to catch her breath before Agatha was on her again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bedroom,” Agatha murmured between kissed, and Rio found herself being backed up in the direction of said room. Her surroundings were a blur, her vision mostly of Agatha’s cheeks and hair. She was surprised when the back of legs met the edge of the bed, even more so when Agatha pushed her down onto the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared up at her breathlessly, watching as Agatha’s chest also rose and fell. Towering over her, Agatha looked like a goddamn goddess. She bit her lip at the sight, certain the evidence of her arousal would be visible through her trousers.
    </p>
<p>
     She expected Agatha to reenact their phone call. Gradually peeling off clothes, teasing the other until they were both bare and desperate. Instead, Rio watched in awe as Agatha kicked off her clothes, leaving her in a bra and panties.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” Rio cursed. “You’re so fucking sexy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed before biting her lip. “I’ll let you take these off.”
    </p>
<p>
     That did it. Rio reached forward and pulled Agatha onto the bed on top of her.  Her hands traced, her curves, from her barely covered hip up to the side of her bra. Her skin was so soft, softer then even the finest of silk, and pale like driven snow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “This hardly seems fair.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You had more layers to take off than me,” Rio argued. “Now we’re even.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, I’ll let you take off my bra if you…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quickly began to pull at the buttons of her waistcoat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swatted her hands away and took over, this time with more care. “If this was any other piece of your wardrobe, I would gladly rip it to shreds, but I know how much this cost.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I really don’t care right now,” Rio insisted. “I’ll pay you back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Want to pay me back five thousand dollars?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?! I’ve been walking around wearing five…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio never finished her sentence. Agatha finished unbuttoning the waistcoat and pushed the fabric out of her way. Delicate hands moved to her breasts, tracing them with light fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Beautiful,” Agatha whispered, her eyes marvelling at the sight before her. Rio just stared up at her, scared her voice would shatter the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Until Agatha lowered her lips to her right nipple. Then, Rio moaned.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands played with her lover’s hair feverishly as she gasped at the way Agatha’s tongue played with the sensitive bud. It felt so good, Rio thought she was going to break there and then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio groaned. “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha trailed kisses down her stomach before her hands moved to unbutton her trousers. Rio watched breathless as she caught the zip with her teeth and pulled it down. It made her raise her hips, and Agatha chuckled. She took the opportunity to carefully pull the trousers from her hips and down off her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was bare. Totally at Agatha’s mercy. She had never felt so alive.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached forward and pulled the waistcoat from her shoulders and folded the suit carefully on the chair in the corner.
    </p>
<p>
     “There.” Agatha crawled back onto the bed. “Now we don’t have to worry about that anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly, Agatha, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth cut her off. She devoured Rio’s lips with a hunger unlike anything she had ever experienced. Rio tried to give as much back, but she was totally lost in the sensation.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been wanting to fuck you for so long,” Agatha said against her lips. “But right now, I really want to taste you.”
    </p>
<p>
     The next thing Rio knew, Agatha’s head was between her thighs, her breath hot against her folds. She tried to breathe steady, her eyes locked with Agatha’s. It was a sight she wanted burned in her mind forever.
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha smirked and lowered her head, and Rio bit back a moan.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s tongue licked her twice, firm and long, before settling on her clit. Rio’s hand clutched the back of Agatha’s head as she tried to keep herself from being ridiculously loud.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be quiet on my account,” Agatha said between strokes. “I want to hear you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio threw her head back, allowing herself to let go.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s tongue moved in the same pattern she used on her nipple, and it made her gasp. Really, she shouldn’t have been surprised. Of course Agatha Harkness knew how to use her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet something was missing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tugged on her hair. “Get back up here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whined against her, the vibration making Rio bite her lip hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I want us to finish together. Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched as Agatha reluctantly shuffled back up her. Rio smiled up at her, her hands moving to the back of her bra. “Can I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said you could,” Agatha reminded her, and Rio didn’t waste a second. She popped the back open and pulled the straps from her arms. Once the offending item was out of the way, Rio took in the sight before her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked down at her. “See something you like?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled at Agatha’s thighs as she sat up, manoeuvring them until her love was straddling her waist. Her mouth dipped and pressed open-mouthed kisses against each of her breasts as her hand moved to squeeze her ass.
    </p>
<p>
     “So fucking gorgeous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha yanked at her hair, making Rio look up at her. “I need you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand snaked between them and stuck her hand in Agatha’s panties. She dropped her head to the crook of Agatha’s neck and moaned. “Fuck, you’re dripping.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed shakily. “You’re one to talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     A hand slid against the back of hers, and Rio gasped as two fingers pushed inside her. She looked up at Agatha and saw her sapphire eyes had turned to obsidian. Biting her lip, she gathered as much wetness as she could and slid her own fingers inside Agatha’s waiting body.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s moans were like music, akin to that of an angel’s song. Their bodies rocked together, their fingers thrusting into the other at a matching pace. A pace that started slow, before getting desperate and faster, and faster. Rio groaned and pressed a hot kiss against Agatha’s mouth, mingling their righteous moans.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please Rio,” Agatha groaned against her mouth, her voice getting higher and higher. “Please, please, please, please…”
    </p>
<p>
     They came gasping into each other’s mouths, eyes closed as they felt the other’s walls convulse against their fingers. A tear trailed down Rio’s cheek. She’d never felt like this before. So fulfilled. So completed.
    </p>
<p>
     They pressed their foreheads together as they came down, Rio’s free hand playing with the ends of Agatha’s hair while a tight hand gripped into her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Still inside each other, they opened their eyes, deep brown staring into crystal blue. They stayed like that for a moment before Agatha leaned forward and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio fell back against the bed, she knew her life would never be the same.

<div>
<p>
     It was nearly midnight, and Agatha was stood over her stove, wearing one of her oversized t-shirts. She smiled as she mixed the sauce with the pasta, her senses still tingling from her earlier activities. A part of her thought she was dreaming, but not even her mind could dream up something like that.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had come two more times after their first, soul-sealing orgasm: the second on Rio’s thigh, and the third on her tongue. That tongue. The thought made her bite her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t let Rio off easy either. No, no. She’d meant it when she said she wanted to taste her. Even after savouring two more of Rio’s climaxes, she used her fingers to round up to Rio’s fourth of the night.
    </p>
<p>
     Not that she was keeping score. Just making a mathematical observation.
    </p>
<p>
     In all their desire, they hadn’t realized they’d forgotten all about dinner until Rio’s stomach started grumbling. And so there she was, cooking for her lover to sustain themselves for the night ahead. Because she was nowhere near done. Not even close.
    </p>
<p>
     Two arms circled around her waist, and a chin came to rest on her shoulder. Agatha’s smile grew as she leant into the warm body pressed against her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “That smells good,” Rio commented. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was going to be our dinner on Thursday, though I think we upgraded.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure this will give Lilia’s lasagne a run for its money,” Rio insisted. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My grandmother’s signature pasta, but I’ve had to subsidise the parmesan for cheddar and the fresh chicken for chicken nuggets.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed against her ear. “I’m just imagining you sat here eating dino nuggets and tater tots....”
    </p>
<p>
     “Chicken nuggets,” Agatha corrected her. “And they’re a snack for if Billy comes over.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, yeah. Hey, I love dino nuggets. I had some last week.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never had a dino nugget in my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Liar.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not,” Agatha insisted. “My grandmother cooked everything from scratch, and I never really ate at my dad’s until I actually started living with him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We always went out somewhere instead,” Agatha explained. “You know, because it was a treat.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So your mother didn’t...”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “I don’t think she even believes in dinosaurs.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So she doesn’t believe in lesbians or dinosaurs?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or lesbian dinosaurs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed and hugged her tighter. “I will be your lesbian dinosaur”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Takes one to know one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Says the woman who has more books than Barnes and Noble.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “I wish.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nuzzled her neck. “I’ll buy you a whole bookshop.”
    </p>
<p>
     “With what money?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you. I have money. You’d be surprised how much Alice and I get in royalties. Alice is using it at the minute though. She’s still between jobs, but she’s using the time to go through our mom’s stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You still have a lot of it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course.” Rio kissed her neck. “We kept it in case either of us had kids. You know, so they can get the Lorna Wu experience.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at the thought of a tiny Rio running around kitted out in Witches’ Road merch. “Can I get the Lorna Wu experience?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, my love. But right now, you’re getting the Rio Vidal experience.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned in her arms. Rio was wearing yet another of her shirts- the Fleetwood Mac one she had wanted to steal last time upon her own insistence. Her hair was a mess, and her face bare apart from a relaxed smile. She leaned in and kissed her again.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted the Rio Vidal experience to last forever.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to deepen the kiss, but Agatha lightly pushed her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m cooking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let it burn.” Rio went to kiss her again, but Agatha pushed her back once more and turned back to the stove.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be a good girl and sit down at the table.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t just call me a good girl…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up and sit down.”
    </p>
<p>
     She plated the pasta and carried it over to where Rio sat waiting. For someone who wanted to abandon the meal, Rio certainly ate it fast.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why didn’t you tell me you’re an amazing cook?” Rio asked between mouthfuls. “This is amazing!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s just a good recipe,” Agatha insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, I bet if I cooked it, it would taste like shit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure it wouldn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust me, it would.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so another birthday gift can be for you to cook for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “No way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate cooking. Lilia has tried to teach me, and sometimes I can help, but I couldn’t do a whole dish from scratch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Doesn’t have to be from scratch,” Agatha assured. “Just edible.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s also a big ask.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just try. Please. For me?”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Rio stubbornness melt away. “That’s not fair. You know I’d do anything for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You would?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward. “Just ask and you shall receive.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve given me more than enough,” Agatha assured her. “How about we finish this off and get settled in for the night?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” Rio looked back at her nearly finished plate. “You want to go to sleep?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to hold back her smile. “Okay then what do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her, eyes dark with desire. “I want to see the box.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked at her in surprise. “The box?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The one Jen mentioned. Under your bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back. That had ages ago, when they met Alice and Jen for dinner and Rio was teasing her. “You remembered that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember? It’s all I’ve been able to think about.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed her plate away from her. “What have you been thinking about specifically?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just revelling in the unknown possibilities.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you like it to no longer be…unknown?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed her own plate away. “Very much so.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well then.” Agatha picked up the plates and quickly rinsed them in the sink, before taking Rio’s hand and leading her back through to the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just going to freshen up,” Agatha told her. “You know, brush my teeth and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you don’t have to explain to me what you’re doing,” Rio assured her as she sat down on the bed. “I’ll be waiting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha made quick work of her nightly routine, before getting out some toiletries for Rio. As she let Rio get herself ready, she crawled under her bed and hauled the box up onto the mattress. She didn’t lift the lid, but sat crossed legged on the bed, staring at it in contemplation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t a prude. She enjoyed sex, and she wasn’t afraid of showing it. Still, she knew the box itself was a little…much.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked out of the bathroom, and Agatha watched her instantly lock on to the box. Her eyes wide, she approached, staring at it in surprise before smiling with amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     “You keep your sex toys in a Chanel box?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged it off. “What can I say? I’m a woman of class.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned as she sat opposite Agatha, the box resting between them. “May I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, and watched nervously as Rio carefully lifted the lid.
    </p>
<p>
     “Holy shit!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, before you…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have half an adult store in here!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t overexaggerate,” Agatha huffed. She should have known this would happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I’m more impressed than anything, but it seems I’m a lot more innocent than you. I mean, what does that one even do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it spreads…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay. We’ll leave that one for today. So, how do you use them? With other people, I mean.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed softly. “Are you asking me if I strap up?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shuffled closer. “Well?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I do. And I don’t switch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Is that going to be a problem?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No but…do you not like it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’ve never tried it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You haven’t?” The surprise in Rio’s voice was just as prevalent as the surprise on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like being in control.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip and looked down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that okay?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you want to be in control, Agatha,” Rio lifted her gaze, pupils dilated with desire. “You can be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her relief was overthrown by her the overwhelming urge to push Rio into the pillows. “Pick which one you want,” she told her, smirking as Rio picked a toy out instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Setting her harness aside also, Agatha picked up the box and put it back under the bed. She didn’t bother taking off her shirt, just settled the purple toy in place before fastening the straps around her waist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had manoeuvred herself to the top of the bed, she too not bothering to take off her shirt. She spread her legs as Agatha moved towards her, and the shirt rode up over her stomach. Agatha couldn’t hold back. She was on her in an instant, reaching blindly for her nightstand.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think we need that,” Rio argued as she watched Agatha apply the bottle’s contents to the silicone shaft jutting out between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not hurting you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You won’t hurt me,” Rio assured. “I can handle big-”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her hard. “But you won’t have had better.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Rio asked, her breathing heavier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really,” Agatha said with confidence. No- determination.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what are you waiting for?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t wait and relished the gasp that left Rio’s mouth as she slid inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped halfway and studied Rio’s face. Her eyes were closed, her brow knitted, her lips pressed in a tight line.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, and Agatha let out a surprised gasp of her own as a firm hand clawed at her ass cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep going,” Rio said on sharp breaths. “Please keep going.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed forward again until she was fully inside, eliciting an even louder moan from the enchantress beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tipped her head back, her hands moving to clutch Agatha’s forearms. “Fuck, baby. You feel so good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slowly built up a rhythm, letting Rio’s moans guide her. At first, it was deep and slow. Her hand massaged Rio’s breast through her shirt, and her lips went to add more marks to Rio’s neck. The feel of her, the smell of her, her sinful gasps and groans in her ear. It was enough to make her moan along with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Then Rio moved her hips to meet hers, and the back of the purple phallus rubbed against her clit. The friction made Agatha gasp. “Rio, fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     They moved together, still slow, still deep, until Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. She moved faster, burying her face into Rio’s neck as she gasped against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands clutched to her shoulders, the sounds she was making closer to screams than moans. Agatha wanted her to get louder, but her brain was too clouded to comprehend encouraging her. All she could do was groan along with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Rio spoke her name with a rawness that made Agatha move even faster.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love?” She spoke against her lover’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m-” Rio let out a deep moan. “Fuck, I’m so close.”
     <br/>
     “Me too.” Agatha managed to lift her head, looking down at Rio. Her lips were wet, her eyelids heavy, a red flush across her cheeks. She had never looked so gorgeous.
    </p>
<p>
     She snuck her hand under Rio’s shirt and palmed at her breast again, the skin warm against her hand as she rolled her pebbled nipple.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio arched up into her tough. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. Agatha please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was so close. So close but she had to get Rio there first.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come for me,” she said. “Please, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s head tilted back, her eyes shut and thighs tightening as her mouth opened into a silent moan. The sight, and the way her body shuddered against her, was enough to make Agatha follow her into searing pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     She slumped back on top of Rio as she came down, twirling the strands of her that fanned around her on the pillow. She felt Rio’s own hands roam soothingly over Agatha’s back as their breaths began to slow.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio shifted, until their heads both rested side by side on the pillow, their faces inches apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re beautiful,” Agatha mused, moving a stray strand of hair out of Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward and captured her lips in a soft kiss. No tongue, no teeth, just two pairs of lips in need of connection.
    </p>
<p>
     When they pulled away, Agatha went to move, but Rio put a hand on the small of her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just stay another minute.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited until she felt Rio’s hand slide up her back and shifted her hips to pull out. Rio groaned at the loss, only for her hand to quickly move for the harness clasps. She undid it and pulled the straps from Agatha’s body.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll clean this,” she said, but Agatha grasped her hand. She took the harness and threw it in the direction of the bathroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her in confusion, and Agatha watched as it transformed into one of realization, and then anticipation the further she slid down her body.
    </p>
<p>
     She cleaned Rio with her tongue, the cherry lube mixing perfectly with Rio’s addictive taste. Accompanied by the soundtrack of deep moans, Agatha didn’t stop until she felt Rio tug at her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a sleepy grin. “I’m fucking amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “You really do know what you’re doing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I could say the same to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slowly shifted and swung her legs over the bed. Standing up, Agatha watched her shakily walk to the bathroom, picking up the strap as she went. Once the bathroom door shut, Agatha ran a hand through her hair and headed through to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     She fixed them both a glass of water. They certainly needed it after that. Senõr Scratchy was up, totally unaware of what had just happened in the room next door. Agatha smiled at him and threw in a bit of lettuce as a late-night snack. She left him nibbling away and carried the glasses back through to the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was back on the bed, still flushed but more alert as she sat against the headboard. She accepted the glass with a grateful smile, and scooted over so Agatha could settle beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for my new accessories.” Rio revealed the marks on her neck. Agatha winced. The marks were already obvious, let alone how they would look in the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a guilty sip of her drink. “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be sorry. You want to see the one I left on your shoulder.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly pulled back the neck of her shirt and spotted the red teeth marks on her left shoulder. She smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I like all of mine,” Rio insisted. “I wear each one with pride.”
    </p>
<p>
     They set their glasses on their respective bedside tables, before settling under the sheets. Agatha held Rio against her, smiling at the way Rio’s fingers played sleepily with the ends of her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha? Can you promise me something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed the top of her head. “Anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, just be here when I wake up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise, my love.” Agatha held her closer. “I’ll be right here with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head and kissed Agatha lightly on the lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Three words tingled on Agatha’s tongue, words that crept up on her all of a sudden but were also no surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet now was not the time for that. Instead, she tucked Rio’s head under her chin and allowed sleep to consume them both.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes flickered open, blinking rapidly as the adjusted to the light. Taking in her surroundings, she smiled. She had recalled that exact moment a thousand times. Laid on soft white sheets, wearing the same oversized shirt while surrounded by the smell of her now favourite perfume. This time, however, there was something firm and warm against her back, and a light hand softly rubbing her arm, coaxing her to wakefulness.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back into the body behind her, a content smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning.” Agatha placed a light kiss against her shoulder. “Sleep well?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know I did.” Rio grasped her hand and kissed it. “What time is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No idea,” Agatha answered. “The clock is behind me, but I’m guessing mid-morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well we did have a late night…”
    </p>
<p>
     “And a very active one too.” She felt Agatha wrap her arms around her waist, holding her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Last night was okay, wasn’t it?” Rio asked. “I didn’t push…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought I was the one doing the pushing,” Agatha quipped, kissing at her neck. “Last night was perfect. You were perfect.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled softly, a blush crossing her cheeks. “Thank you though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, need I remind you…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean for staying when I asked.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her neck again. “I promised I would, but now you’re awake I really need to pee.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed as Agatha jumped out of bed and raced to the bathroom, before star fishing out on the sheets. She could definitely get used to this. Stealing a glance at the clock, she saw it was just after ten. That left her with plenty of time to get done what she had to before Agatha’s big night out began.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha emerged from the bathroom and pulled two robes out of her wardrobe. She slipped one on before throwing the other at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pancakes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want pancakes?” Agatha asked as she moved towards the door. “I usually have them on a Saturday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is so adorable,” Rio teased. “And yes please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha playfully rolled her eyes before disappearing into the living area. Rio sighed and rolled out of bed. She slipped on the robe and headed to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t been kidding- her neck did look worse in the morning. Or better. She kind of liked looking at it. Each mark evidence of Agatha’s desire, not that she needed it. The pleasant ache between her legs was proof enough.
    </p>
<p>
     When she met Agatha in the kitchen, she found her busy with the pancakes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Smells good,” she commented before kissing Agatha’s cheek. “I may be needing that whisk though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned at her, only to let out a snort of laughter when she saw it. “You’re going to need a blender.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s yours?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha revealed her shoulder, showing the mark was still visible. “And before you get any ideas, remember my sister is coming tonight, and she doesn’t take kindly to people manhandling me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pointed to her neck. “Who was the one doing the manhandling?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh shush. Please can you feed Senõr Scratchy?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her cheek again and headed over to her favourite bunny.
    </p>
<p>
     They ate the pancakes with little hassle, until Agatha suggested they share a shower which ended up just being a very soggy make-out session. Soon, Rio found herself sat wearing nothing but a pair of Agatha’s jeans, while Agatha herself sat fully clothed beside her, working the whisk against her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio squirmed. “Be gentle.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gentle isn’t going to do anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it doing anything anyway?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It actually is,” Agatha said in amazement. “I didn’t think it would work.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you ever done this before?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A few times, but they all tapped out before I was done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was determined to see it through, but it didn’t take long for Agatha to sigh and set the whisk aside.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll have to do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the compact mirror Agatha had given her. The marks were better, but she would definitely need some concealer…and an ice pack.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want me to dry clean your suit?” Agatha said as she began moving around the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you need to put it in a vacuum bag and keep it in a safe,” Rio told her, only half joking. Who spent that much on a fake girlfriend? Even if they did end up being more. “Can I borrow something to wear home?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached into her wardrobe and handed her a shirt. “Here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied the item with a frown. “Isn’t this mine?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I meant to give you it on Thursday, so I hung it up to stop it creasing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You really are adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.” Agatha grabbed her waist and pulled her into a quick kiss, before Rio felt her tug on the shirt. “May I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio handed the shirt and held her arms up so Agatha could pull it over her head, kissing her again as soon as her head escaped the fabric.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to do something?” Agatha asked. “See a movie? Go for a walk? Look at some flowers?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wished she could, she really did, but she had too much to do in preparation for Agatha’s big day. “I actually have to run some errands.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I can help.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s the kind of errands I need to do alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     The disappointment was evident on Agatha’s face, and it made Rio want to hug her and never leave. Yet she had to.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll see you tonight,” Rio reminded her. “Then you’re probably going to be stuck with me until Monday morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just until Monday morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, if you want me to come to work with you, I will. You’ll just have to get me a pillow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A pillow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “For under your desk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at that. “You really are determined to get me a HR complaint.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I love a challenge.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer. She just kissed her again, and Rio relished every moment of it.
    </p>
<p>
     When they were reluctantly ready, Agatha walked her to the door and held it open for her to walk through. “Are you sure I can’t take you home?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going home,” Rio reminded her as she stepped out into the hallway. “And I don’t want any surprises getting spoiled.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate surprises,” Agatha grumbled. “They take me by…surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I love them, so tough.” Rio pecked her lips. “And I think you’ll love these ones. At least, I hope you will.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Will we end up naked in bed at some point during your big birthday plans?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pretend to think. “I can probably pencil that in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’ll have a great day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re no better than a man,” Rio said in mock disgust, earning herself one of Agatha’s sinfully dirty kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you stay another hour?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I need to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put a finger to her lips. “Agatha Harkness, you can survive a few hours without me. I’ll see you at the bar at six.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I pick you up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you pick me up?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered that one, before shaking her head. “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned and rested her head against the doorframe. “You’re killing me here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be dramatic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I walk you to the elevator?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio relented on that one, and quickly found herself walking hand in hand with her most-definitely-official girlfriend. Agatha pressed the elevator call button and squeezed her hand as they both watched the numbers rise on the display, pleading it would take forever.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn’t, and soon the doors opened. Rio let go of Agatha’s hand and stepped inside. She pushed the button for the lobby and offered Agatha a reassuring smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll see you later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “See you later,” Agatha repeated, but Rio could see the sadness in her eyes. She knew because she was feeling it too.
    </p>
<p>
     She waved at Agatha as the doors closed, her heart aching when she disappeared.  Only a few hours, she told herself, and tomorrow it would all be worth it.

<p>
     Agatha found Sharon stood awkwardly outside the bar, clutching her handbag to her chest with a worried expression on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why haven’t you gone inside?” she asked as she approached.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was waiting for you,” Sharon answered. “I went in, but I couldn’t see you or Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t in the best of moods. It had taken her forever to pick out an outfit, choosing to opt for a black jumpsuit, and her hair had decided to knot itself six ways to Sunday, which had taken up even more of her time, then her cab driver had been incompetent and taken her to the wrong place, so after a heated argument she’d  had to walk three blocks, making her even later!
    </p>
<p>
     And she missed Rio. That was the main issue.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha led Sharon through the bar, spotting her sister and Alice sat at a table together, deep in conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she didn’t like that at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca noticed her first and waved her over. “There you are! We thought you’d ditched us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Alice added, “where have you all been?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored the question. “How did you two find each other?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I recognized her from Rio’s Instagram,” Rebecca answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “You follow my girlfriend on instagram?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but your nephew is obsessed and keeps showing me posts.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. It was a good thing she and Rio were actually together now, though she hoped Billy’s investment in her love life would soon fade.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is Sharon,” Agatha introduced, and the older woman gave them her signature sweet smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice pulled out the chair beside her. “Come join. We’re discussing how long it’s going to take for Rio to U-Haul herself into Agatha’s apartment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not u-hauling herself anywhere,” Agatha told her. “We’re taking things slow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think they’re just so sweet,” Sharon said as she settled beside Alice. “On Wednesday, Agatha was having a bad day and Rio came running in with sandwiches.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sensed Rebecca looking at her but refused to meet her gaze, instead moving the topic along. “We both have the same taste in sandwiches. It seems we’re strangely compatible.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Compatible?” Alice laughed. “You’re her dream girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down beside her sister. “I doubt that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No seriously,” Alice insisted. “The day you met she was texting me in the coffee shop bathroom saying how perfect you were.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She did?” That had been just a few minutes after they met. How could Rio decide that so quickly?
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah. Even after...well, you know, she kept saying you had been like a dream come true.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought over this new information, too lost in her thoughts that she didn’t pick up on her sister’s chuckle until it was too late.
    </p>
<p>
     “This one was the same. Checking her phone all the time hoping she’d get a call. I guess it was for the best in the end, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “How so?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it was meant to be this time round,” Rebecca explained. “I mean, now look at you? Both in love...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Love?” Alice questioned. “Rio didn’t tell me you’d said...”
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t,” Agatha insisted. “It’s her son’s overactive imagination.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca scoffed. “Neither of you denied it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon grinned. “Oh, so you definitely do!”
    </p>
<p>
     “And Rio does. It’s so obviou...”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slapped her hands on the table. “Shall we get some drinks?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio told me not to let you,” Alice responded. “She wants to buy the first round.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her watch. It was almost quarter past and still no sign of either of the chaotic roommates.
    </p>
<p>
     “So Sharon,” she decided to pivot instead. “How are the grandkids?”
    </p>
<p>
     That successfully took Sharon and Rebecca onto a discussion about kids, which Alice tried her best to keep up with, while Agatha just watched the door. She didn’t want to bother Rio by calling, but she was impatient, and a little bit concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, she saw Lilia striding across the bar towards them. Greeting them all with a smile, she sat down next to Sharon. “Apologies. My roommate is being very high maintenance.” She pointed at Agatha. “And before you ask, she’s paying for the cab.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How much?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She said you’d ask that and told me not to tell you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue. “Okay then, Rebecca, Sharon, this is Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m the sister,” Rebecca explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m the roommate,” Lilia replied, before she turned in her seat to look at Sharon. “And you must be the assistant?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon held out her hand. “Nice to meet you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia smirked and took her hand, lifting it up to place a light kiss to her knuckles. “Piaciri di canuscirv.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon giggled in response. “What language is that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sicilian,” Lilia explained. “My ancestral tongue.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow.” Sharon’s cheeked had reddened with a blush. “How exotic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha side-eyed them both, before she felt the hairs on her neck stand on end.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking round, she saw Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Her Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The Rio that had left her house with damp hair and faded jeans, walking towards them like Aphrodite coming out of the waves.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hair was straight, her eyes dark with her lips painted a sharp burgundy, and her dress…
    </p>
<p>
     That fucking dress.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sheer nude, and strapless aside for two strings looped around her neck, bringing the top of the dress to a point just below the junction of her collar bones. The dress was loose enough to have a straight fall along her hips, but hugged to the under curve of her breasts, which could be seen deliciously through the material. Matching lace incorporated the top of the dress and the slit down the side, revealing the leg that had been wrapped around her head less than twenty-four hours before.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to fall to her knees there and then. Instead, she stood and pulled out the chair beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello my love,” Rio greeted, and Agatha placed a kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once Rio was settled, Agatha sat back down beside her, still marvelling at her beauty. “You look so good.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, sweetheart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When did you get that dress?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Last week,” Rio said before her lips went to Agatha’s ear. “I got it so you would finally fuck me, only it’s a bit redundant now, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked and shifted to whisper back. “Honey, I haven’t fucked you yet. Not even close.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cleared her throat and went to stand. “Drinks. Who wants drinks?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, watching Rio get everyone’s orders, and Sharon, ever helpful, went along with her to the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca slapped Agatha’s arm. “What’s with all the whispering?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t I whisper to my girlfriend?” Agatha questioned defensively. “My god.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t come all the way here only for you to instantly get in your Rio bubble the minute she sits down.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Please, can you remember when I flew home for your birthday my first year of college only for you to ditch me for whatever-his-face-was the entire week?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was sixteen!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Seventeen by the end of it, and what do you mean ‘my Rio bubble’. There is no Rio bubble.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca just laughed at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re being weird at the moment,” Alice accused. “They’re touchier, and they totally ditched me and Jen last night. We hadn’t even ordered food!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, that’s rude,” Rebecca scolded.
    </p>
<p>
     “So? I am rude.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca shook her head in defeat, but Alice continued on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen and I decided to go get takeout on the way home. She was a bit put out, especially because she couldn’t come tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure she’ll live,” Agatha sassed back.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not the point. You two are acting like you’re the only two people…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, shut up,” Rio interjected as she skilfully carried four drinks to the table, Sharon following her with two. She handed out the drinks, saving Agatha’s for last, holding it just out of reach.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s my payment?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked and kissed her. It was only a peck, but it was enough to make the table erupt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ew!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gross!”
    </p>
<p>
     “See, they’re touchy!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, shut up,” Rio said again, handing Agatha her drink before sitting down with her own. “Why are you all so bothered? You know we’re together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you don’t do that.” Alice pointed between them. “Jen said Agatha doesn’t like PDA.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen doesn’t know shit,” Agatha countered, putting her arm around the back of Rio’s chair. “I can kiss my girlfriend if I want.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No one said you can’t,” Rebecca insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s sweet,” Sharon interjected before sipping on her club soda.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was just a shock,” Alice explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “And out of character,” Rebecca added. “I think I’ve only seen you kiss someone twice, and once was by accident!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Both times were by accident,” Agatha corrected. “You don’t know how to knock.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just don’t understand,” Alice spoke up again. “Why are you both suddenly acting like a pair of teenagers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s because they’ve had sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes landed on Lilia, who took a sip of her martini with an all-knowing smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to strangle her, and Rio looked like she was ready to stab her with a paper straw.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Alice looked between them with wide eyes. “You two finally had sex! Is that why you left last night?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeez Alice want to shout that any louder?” Rio huffed. “Don’t think those frat boys in the back heard you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice got out her phone and started typing frantically. “I need to tell Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know they had sex?” Sharon asked Lilia, who chuckled and placed a hand on the other woman’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exhibit A: Rio didn’t come home last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I could have just slept on her couch,” Rio insisted. “That proves nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And so, for Exhibit B…” Lilia moved Rio’s hair to reveal her failed attempts at hiding the marks littering her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh come on!” Alice grimaced, before leaning over the table with her phone. “Let me get a photo for Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smacked her hand away. “Like you’ve never had a hickey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So they are hickies then?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her head in her hands. This was a nightmare.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait this whole time you hadn’t had sex?” Rebecca questioned. “Erm…why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because we wanted to take it slow,” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio backed her up, “excuse us for not rushing into things.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There is taking it slow then there is being totally repressed,” Lilia stated. “You two were leaning towards the latter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was not repressed,” Rio insisted, at which Lilia laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You forget how thin our apartment’s walls are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went bright red and sipped at her drink. Agatha saved that information for later.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we please stop talking about this?” Sharon asked. “I mean I’m happy for them, but I think it’s their business.”
    </p>
<p>
     The table grew quiet for a moment, before Rebecca and Alice began bombarding them with questions again. As she tried to weather the storm, Agatha heard her phone beep. Checking it, she saw it was a message from Jen.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Heard I won the bet! I expect details when I’m home.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and took Rio’s hand, squeezing it for comfort. This was going to be a long night.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Somewhere between bar two and three, the topic moved on from their sex life, much to Rio’s relief. Luckily the questions hadn’t been pushing for the explicit details; she would have never been able to look Sharon in the eye again. It seemed that their family and friends were very invested in the success of their relationship, which she guessed wasn’t a bad thing, even if their enthusiasm came with very little boundaries.
    </p>
<p>
     They walked down the street, Alice and Rebecca leading the way, while Lilia had Sharon giggling as they followed. Rio and Agatha trailed behind, hand in hand, enjoying some semi-alone time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you enjoying yourself?” Rio asked, and Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t say I’m bored.” She leaned over and kissed Rio’s cheek. “I do wish we were at home, though. You look so good. I actually don’t want your dress to come off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip. “That might cause some issues later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve already thought about it. We can more than make it work.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squeezed her hand. “High libido baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh sweetheart I know.” And Rio loved it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Rebecca shouted excitedly. “Look!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gaze followed to where Rebecca was pointing and frowned. “A karaoke bar?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. “Okay let’s go home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t.” Rebecca moved back and grabbed Agatha’s hand. “We need to give the people what they deserve, and that is the musical stylings of Agatha Harkness!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and nudged Agatha towards the door. Now this was going to be a good time.
    </p>
<p>
     They got a table while Alice run up and got a request slip for each of them. “No ifs, no buts. Everyone is singing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and looked through the extensive song list. She hated singing and she hated karaoke, but she’d sit through it if it meant getting Agatha up there.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we do duets?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent.” Lilia patted Sharon’s hand. “We’re singing
     <em>
      Islands in the Stream
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Aww that’s cute,” Alice said with a smile. Rio on the other hand eyed Lilia suspiciously, but her attention soon gravitated elsewhere.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we do a duet?” she asked Agatha, who glared back at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going for my favourite.” Rebecca handed her slip to one of the passing staff. “
     <em>
      Left Outside Alone!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh so you’re
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     drunk,” Agatha teased. “At least you haven’t moved on to
     <em>
      Don’t Stop Believing
     </em>
     yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca mocked a laugh. “Says Miss
     <em>
      B-B-Bennie and the Jets
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rebecca!” Agatha scolded, but it was too late.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Alice asked. “I wouldn’t have taken you for an Elton girl?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “It’s a good song, and it was one time!”
    </p>
<p>
     “One time that had the whole place screaming!” Rebecca insisted. “I thought she’d embodied a rock star!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. Oh, this was just too good. “Agatha please sing that!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope I never sing the same song twice,” she insisted. “And I’m not a performing seal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did performing arts in college,” Rebecca reminded her (and Rio). “She got scouted for Yale, but she turned it down!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up in her chair. “Why the hell did you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, just glared at her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like to know the answer too,” Lilia added, Sharon and Alice also nodding in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “We all told her she was being ridiculous,” Rebecca explained. “But you see, Agatha had dreams of her own.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put a hand on Agatha’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “What dream was that?” Alice asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gulped her drink down in one and slammed the empty glass down on the table. “I wanted to be a writer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a journalist?” Alice questioned, but Rio knew that wasn’t the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted to be a novelist,” Agatha admitted. “It was a stupid dream, but it got me into a job that pays more than anything either law or drama school could have gotten me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice leaned forward in fascination. “Where you any good?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, before waving to a waitress for another drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s fucking amazing,” Rebecca answered. “Which is why we decided to forgive the Yale thing. I just wish she’d pick it up again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her, too busy trying to get the attention of the oblivious waitress.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll get you it,” Rio assured as she stood. Alice jumped up too, declaring she would help.
    </p>
<p>
     The sisters walked to the bar, and after a moment of silence, Rio cut to the chase. “What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I read more of Mom’s journals today.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to publish her story.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved to the waitress. “Two double vodka and cokes, and a shot of tequila.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m listening,” she insisted. “Just…what’s in there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “About us?”
    </p>
<p>
     “About me and my dad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Alice admitted. “The point I’m up to, she’s not even pregnant with me yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip. She wasn’t drunk enough to deal with this.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Alice questioned. “Do you think there’ll be something bad in there?”
    </p>
<p>
     The waitress lined the drinks up on the bar, and Rio didn’t hesitate to knock back the shot. Wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, she looked to Alice with a serious gaze. “Just promise me something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep my mom out of it, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Promise me, Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded. “Sure, I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, and…when you get to that part, just let me explain. Okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, what do you…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked up the two drinks and walked back to the table without another word.
    </p>
<p>
     She handed Agatha her drink and sat back down beside her. “So, about this duet…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, it’ll be fun!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said no.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio brought her lips to her ear. “I’ll let you fuck me in the bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pass me that damn paper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca held it out, but Rio quickly snatched it. With a sneaky grin, she scribbled down their choice and handed it to one of the staff.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared her down. “What did you put?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “You’ll see.”
    </p>
<p>
     As promised, Lilia and Sharon’s duet was both humble and surprisingly good. Lilia took on Kenny and Sharon sang Dolly, and they seemed to love every moment. Though they did shoot a glare over at them when Agatha wolf-whistled whenever they talked about ‘making love’, something they all ended up joining in on by the end.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice did her usual routine of
     <em>
      No Scrubs
     </em>
     , and Rebecca’s
     <em>
      Left Outside Alone
     </em>
     was pretty good. Throughout it all, Rio waited in anticipation. This upcoming duet was going to go down in history.
    </p>
<p>
     When a bachelorette party had finished their group rendition to *NSYNC, the host got up on stage with the next request.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now we have Rio and Agatha, who are going to wow us with
     <em>
      Shallow
     </em>
     !”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rio in horror. “You fucking didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The sooner we do this, the sooner you get me in that bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and got to her feet. “Come on, then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, before grasped her hand and dragging her on stage.
    </p>
<p>
     The acoustic opening began as they stepped up the mics, waiting for the words to begin on the screen. As soon as Bradley Cooper’s opening line popped up, Rio saw Agatha prepare herself at the mic.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh no. That wasn’t happening.
    </p>
<p>
     As the line began, Rio jumped in first.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Tell me something', girl
      <br/>
      Are you happy in this modern world?
      <br/>
      Or do you need more?
      <br/>
      Is there something' else you're searching' for?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I'm falling'
      <br/>
      In all the good times, I find myself longing'
      <br/>
      For change
      <br/>
      And, in the bad times, I fear myself.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She stepped back from the mic, hearing some cheers from their table, and some small claps from around the room. Rio didn’t care about that though. As the acoustic interlude went on, she locked eyes with Agatha, who stared back at her with pursed lips, but she could tell by her eyes that she was secretly impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, it was Agatha’s turn, and the world around them stopped.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Tell me something, boy
      <br/>
      Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
      <br/>
      Or do you need more?
      <br/>
      Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I'm falling
      <br/>
      In all the good times, I find myself longing
      <br/>
      For change
      <br/>
      And, in the bad times, I fear myself
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t believe it. I mean, she’d had an idea that she would be good, but this…
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she hit the chorus.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
      <br/>
      I'll never meet the ground
      <br/>
      Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
      <br/>
      We're far from the shallow now
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The crowd whistled and whooped, and Rio had to snap out her trance to sing the next part with her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
      <br/>
      In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
      <br/>
      In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
      <br/>
      We're far from the shallow now
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio loved the way their voices mingled together but was eager to step back for the bridge.
    </p>
<p>
     This was it. Agatha’s moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice raised in intensity, hitting ever note, her voice getting stronger, and stronger, building up and up, until she faultlessly hit that last long note like she was pouring out her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio wasn’t already in total awe of Agatha Harkness, she certainly was now.
    </p>
<p>
     Cheers revolved around the room, but Agatha just jumped back into the chorus.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
      <br/>
      I'll never meet the ground
      <br/>
      Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
      <br/>
      We're far from the shallow now
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grinned at her girl and joined her for the outro.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      In the sha-ha, shallow
      <br/>
      In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
      <br/>
      In the sha-ha, shallow
      <br/>
      We're far from the shallow now.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The room erupted in applause, people getting to their feet and cheering them on. Rio took Agatha’s hand, and they both bowed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow!” the host said from the side of the stage. “That’ll be a tough one to follow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Encore!” Lilia shouted. “Do another song!”
    </p>
<p>
     Others joined in, clapping their hands in encouragement, but Rio was quick to step up to the mic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry guys, she’s a one-hit wonder.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t bite, instead using their joined hand to drag Rio off the stage in the direction of the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     To Rio’s delight, the bathroom was one room, lockable and spacious. Absolutely perfect.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha backed her up against the sink, lifting her onto it by her thighs. “So, my reward?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and took Agatha’s hand, leading it under her dress. “Go ahead, superstar.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked at the name, only for her eyes to widen when her hand met her target. “Where are your underwear?”
    </p>
<p>
     “On my bedroom floor,” Rio answered. “I told you this was a fuck-me dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll fuck you later,” Agatha said as she got to her knees, pushing the dress over Rio’s hips. “I hit the high notes for you. Now you’re going to do it for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed up her thigh, before latching on to a sensitive spot. Rio moaned softly, only to squeal and grab on to the sink as teeth pressed against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please Agatha. Please, please, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want, my love?” Agatha asked, her breath hot against her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please just fucking kiss me there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Kiss you where?” She felt Agatha’s lips trail down her pelvic bone. “Here?” Her lips moved to her mound. “Here?” Her lips kissed just above her clit, and Rio let out a deep moan “So I’m close?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Agatha asked. “Am I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh do I?” Agatha moved away, sitting back to look up at her. “Guess what I’m thinking right now, Miss Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That you want to torture me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “No honey. I want to make you scream.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped as Agatha drove in. Lips latching onto her clit, the motion made her grasp at the thick brown locks between her legs. Lips, tongue, the slightest graze of teeth. Agatha was eating her like a woman starved.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck Agatha.” She leaned back, her head pressing against the cool glass of the mirror. “Your mouth is so fucking amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t reply with words. Instead, her tongue dipped inside her, and Rio couldn’t help but scream.
    </p>
<p>
     A few thrusts of that skilful tongue, and she shattered. Burning white bliss, radiating through her like pure magic.
    </p>
<p>
     When she came down, she opened her eyes, staring up at the ceiling. Rio smiled to herself, playing with Agatha’s hair as she continued to lightly lick her clean.
    </p>
<p>
     This was the closest she’d been to heaven.

<p>
     Agatha left the bathroom with a smirk on her face and Rio’s taste lingering on her tongue. She made her way back to their table, aware of the people looking her way in admiration (and a touch of jealous). It seemed she was the resident celebrity for the evening.
    </p>
<p>
     As she sat down, she smiled at her friends, only to meet her sister’s disappointed stare.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” she repeated and heard Alice laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re not stupid,” Lilia told her. “We know exactly what you were doing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. She wasn’t even sorry.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you,” Rebecca huffed. “In a public bathroom of all places.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can get down from your high horse right now,” Agatha told her. “Need I remind you of your 4
     <sup>
      th
     </sup>
     July party two years ago? Or your fortieth? Or when we stopped at the diner when we were taking Billy to Disney…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay.” Rebecca held her hands up. “Point made.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I thought Agatha was the rebellious one,” Rio mused as she sat backed own at the table. Her eyeliner was slightly smudged, but the vision had been unblemished.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca scoffed. “I could tell you stories about her that would make your hair turn white.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like?” Rio prompted, but Agatha cleared her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we head somewhere else?”
    </p>
<p>
     They headed out onto the street. The sun had set, and the temperature had dropped along with it. Agatha had the forward-thinking to wear a coat, while Rio had decided to wander around in next to nothing. Something she hadn’t been complaining about until she saw her love wrap her arms around herself for warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     Hating to see her shiver, Agatha sighed and shrugged off her coat, draping in over her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “Won’t you be cold?” Rio asked, but Agatha simply tucked her under her arm. That was all the warmth she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where shall we go?” Sharon asked, her prior reservations replaced with enthusiasm as she walked arm in arm with Lilia. “I want to dance!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know a place,” Alice answered. “It’s only round the block.”
    </p>
<p>
     They all followed Alice’s lead, chatting away about nonsense in their tipsy states. Rio, however, was too busy looking at something across the street. Agatha followed her gaze and saw she was eyeing up what was probably the greasiest hole-in-the-wall burger joint in the city.
    </p>
<p>
     “You hungry?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snapped out of her thoughts to look at her. “Sorry. I know we had fries and stuff at that second bar, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t explain yourself,” Agatha insisted before calling ahead. “Hey guys, we’re just getting a quick bite to eat. You guys go ahead.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll text you where we are,” Rebecca said, before their group went on without them. Leading Rio across the street, Agatha headed up to the counter, ordering Rio a double cheeseburger. When it was all ready, she handed it to her (pretty much) girlfriend with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “There you go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t hesitate in opening the packaging and taking a large bite, letting out a moan that made Agatha both jealous and turned on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Better?” She asked, and Rio nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Much,” she said, still chewing. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I can’t be the only one eating out, so…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her with big eyes, before she took another bite out of her burger. Agatha had never wanted to be a beef patty so much in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio was done eating, she put her wrappings in the trash and took Agatha’s hand. “Where did they end up?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her phone. “Oh fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not going to believe this.”
    </p>
<p>
     They found Alice and Rebecca stood at the bar, bringing in a line of shots.
    </p>
<p>
     “A gay club?” Rio asked her sister. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shrugged. “Sharon wanted to dance.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around for her assistant. “Please tell me you didn’t lose her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax, she’s over there.” Rebecca pointed into the crowd, and Agatha looked to see Sharon and Lilia dancing away to Rihanna.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice handed out the shots before holding up her own. “To Agatha, the birthday girl and my sister’s longest girlfriend on record!”
    </p>
<p>
     They knocked back the shots, and Agatha quickly went to whisper to Rio again. “Longest girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Technically not yet,” Rio answered. “Two more weeks and you’re a winner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Interesting, Agatha thought. Very interesting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough whispering you two.” Rebecca handed out the next round of shots. “Let’s party!”
    </p>
<p>
     That part of the night was a blur. Lots of dancing, lots of laughing, which led Agatha to the middle of the dance floor, dancing to Britney Spears while Rio pressed up against her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wrapped an arm around her waist and leaned in to kiss her, sharp and hot. She smiled when she felt Rio moan against her lips. Pulling back, she marvelled at how the disco lights played across Rio’s face. She was so beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re unreal!” Rio shouted over the music. “So fucking hot!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Am I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you are!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah chuckled before kissing her again, this time with enough tongue that she heard a guy next to them whistle. Pulling away, she shot him a glare before looking back to Rio. “Wanna get out of here?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t need telling twice. She took Agatha’s hand and dragged her out of the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     They found Alice and Rebecca stood by the bar again, and Rebecca handed Agatha her coat (who instantly handed it to Rio).
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeff’s outside,” she told them. “He’s got Billy with him, so behave.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I always behave,” Agatha insisted before pointing to Rio. “This one, however…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m completely innocent,” Rio insisted, making Alice laugh loudly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around them and frowned. “Where’s Sharon and Lilia?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia wanted to show Sharon this jazz club she likes,” Rebecca explained. “I think she’s determined to show her a good time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She better take care of her,” Agatha huffed. “It’s taken me years to get a decent assistant.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Aw, for a moment it seemed like you cared,” Rio teased, earning her a playful nudge.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s all an act,” Rebecca accused. “She has the biggest heart here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared at her, even if the words did make her embarrassingly warm inside.
    </p>
<p>
     They headed outside and spotted Jeff’s car just down the block.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha saw Rio link arms with Alice. “I can’t wait for you to meet Billy. He’s awesome. And Jeff is pretty cool too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at Rio words. Sure, Billy had met Wanda a number of times, but she had never been too interested in him, or the rest of her family beyond what was necessary. Rio was different, though. Even from the beginning, Rio had been kind. She had been interested. She had just…fit. Both into her family and into her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca nudged Agatha’s arm, bringing her out of her thoughts. “You excited for tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded towards Rio. “Depends what that one has planned for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca chuckled. “You’ll have to wait and see.”
    </p>
<p>
     When they reached the car, Billy shot out the back and went to greet them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t it past your bedtime?” she asked as she pulled him into a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dad and I went exploring while we waited for Mom,” he explained. “Did you have a good time?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did.” Agatha answered. “It was certainly…entertaining.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s attention quickly drifted from her and he all but launched himself at Rio. Luckily, Rio seemed to sense it was coming and embraced him with equal enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey kid! This is a nice surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy pulled back to smile at her. “You look unreal, but is that my aunt’s coat?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I was cold and your aunt is a gentleman.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha heard Rebecca laugh and quickly elbowed her.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is my sister,” Rio introduced Alice. “Alice, this is Billy. Billy, this is Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked like he’d met his favourite celebrity. Because, in a way, this was probably the closest he was ever going to get.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s an honour to meet you,” he said, his hands on his cheeks. “I look up to your mom so much, and I love your sister too, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha warmed not just at his words, but at the smile they incited on Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m glad to meet you,” Alice insisted. “Rio has told me so much about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, do you want a lift home?” Rebecca asked. “I think this one has a lot of questions.”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as your husband doesn’t mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff’s head popped out of the driver’s window. “We don’t mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hugged Rio, before giving Agatha an awkward wave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy birthday for tomorrow,” she said. “Please don’t kill my sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would I want to…”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could finish, Rio jumped in and started pushing Alice towards the car. “Yes, yes, goodbye dear sister of mine. I am totally not going to kill you if you say another word.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once the Kaplan mobile was fully loaded and on its homeward journey, Agatha stepped to the curb to get them a cab, but Rio pulled her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Allow me,” she said as she shrugged off Agatha’s coat.
    </p>
<p>
     A cab was parked in front of them within moments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very clever,” Agatha huffed before handing the coat back to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be jealous baby,” Rio teased before climbing into the cab.
    </p>
<p>
     The cab driver looked at Rio more than the road, and Agatha hated it. She placed a hand on Rio’s thigh, in an attempt to assert her claim, but he didn’t seem to care.  Rio, on the other hand, hummed and placed her head on her shoulder, content and oblivious to it all. That made Agatha relax a little.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she didn’t leave a tip.
    </p>
<p>
     They made their way up to Agatha’s apartment, holding hands and sharing lazy kisses in the elevator. It was natural, peaceful even.
    </p>
<p>
     That changed the moment Agatha got them inside. She kissed Rio fiercely, before regarding her with a smirk.  “Go get yourself ready. If I recall correctly, I made you a promise earlier.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and rushed off to the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, and Rio?” Agatha called after her, making her halt in the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep the dress on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her grin returned, even more devilish than before, then disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Senõr Scratchy with a sympathetic smile. He had gotten an abundance of cuddles that afternoon while she had been missing Rio, but she hated leaving him alone on a night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe you need a friend,” she mused. Perhaps Webbers could stay next time too, as long as Rio promised no escape attempts. The thought of a tarantula roaming freely around her apartment made her shiver.
    </p>
<p>
     She fetched him some lettuce and got him some fresh water.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry,” she told him. “She may be my number one girl, but you’re the number one bunny.”
    </p>
<p>
     He didn’t care, too busy nibbling on his lettuce. He was an intense eater. Sometimes he managed to devour a full leaf without her even noticing. Lettuce, feed, paper…anything he had a taste for was gone before she could blink.
    </p>
<p>
     She was considering getting him out for a cuddle when she heard Rio’s voice float through the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m ready, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Senõr Scratchy one last smile before rushing through to the bedroom. She froze in the doorway, taking in the sight before her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, in that dress, sprawled out for her on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, sweetheart.” Rio propped herself up on her elbows. “I’ve had enough foreplay.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was then Agatha noticed the strap ready on the bedside table and bit her lip. She didn’t feel like the one doing the fucking right now, and strangely she didn’t mind it.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she stripped down to her underwear, before taking off her panties and fastening the harness around her. She went to take off her bra, but Rio held up a finger to stop her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep it on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did what she said, but quickly climbed on the bed, grasping hold of her hips as she leaned down over her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not in charge.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes sparked with excitement, and she giggled when Agatha skilfully flipped her over, arching herself for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha palmed her ass before slipping a hand under her dress. She found her clit with ease and rubbed it in lazy circles. Rio moaned, dropping her face into the pillow before her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shh.” Agatha slid her hand up and pressed two fingers inside her. “Gotta make sure you’re ready, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No lube,” Rio told her, her voice accompanied by the wet sound of Agatha’s movements. “Any more and I’ll be a slip and slide.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but laugh as she pulled her fingers from her. “I quite like those.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up and fuck me!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha used her slick fingers to prep the purple silicone jutting out before her, before carefully pushing the dress over Rio’s hips. “Patience, darling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You promised me you’d f-FUCK!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked as she settled her crotch against Rio’s ass, fully inside her. “Happy now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t reply. Agatha slid out slowly before pushing into her, fast and hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!”
     <br/>
     “I’m guessing that’s a yes.” Agatha set up rhythm, hard and fast. She relished it all. The wet sound of each thrust, their skins slapping together, Rio’s moans, the smell of sex, the way the strap rubbed against her. She never wanted this to end.
    </p>
<p>
     Until Rio let out a particularly loud moan.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she couldn’t wait.
    </p>
<p>
     “Close, baby?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So close, so close, so close, so cl-fuckfuckfuckfuckFUCK AGATHA!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed fully inside as Rio screamed and pushed back against her, shaking until her orgasm faded, and she fell limp against the pillows.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rubbed gentle circles in her back, waiting until Rio’s legs stopped twitching before pulling out. She took off the strap and unhooked her bra, throwing the latter aside before reluctantly leaving her lover to dump the strap in the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     When she returned, Rio had turned on her back, chest rising and falling as she fought to catch her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved over to her. “Let’s get that dress off.”
    </p>
<p>
     She helped Rio sit up, and she carefully removed the dress from her. There was no way Agatha was ruining that dress. In fact, she wanted to buy her ten more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, however, grabbed the dress and threw it aside, pulling Agatha on top of her. “You need to come.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Agatha insisted. “I like making you come.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then do it again.” Rio stuck her thigh between Agatha’s legs, pressing it against her wet folds. Agatha groaned, a groan which grew louder when she felt a wet press against her own thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared down at her for a moment before closing her eyes. Pressing their forehead together, she began to roll her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved together, their rhythm making them both gasp and moan. Their connection was just as intense as their pleasure, and it wasn’t long before they both reached a shared climax, their bodies smouldering into one.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fought to compose herself, fought to catch her breath, but it was too much. Too intense.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re perfect,” she said before she even considered the words. She lifted her head enough to look at Rio, who smiled up at her with sleepy eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You fucked me mind, body and soul.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed softly, letting her walls fall, opening her heart fully to the woman below her, even if just for a few moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head to the clock and smiled. “Happy birthday, my love.”

<p>
     Agatha looked so peaceful when she was sleeping. It was a sight Rio had missed out on the three times they had shared a bed, and it was a sight she found entirely captivating. While Awake Agatha was sharp and restless, Asleep Agatha was soft and peaceful. If she squinted, she could imagine what Agatha had looked like as a child, before Evanora made her fearful and guarded.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wished she could watch her for longer, but they didn’t have the time. So instead, she sat down on the edge of the bed, shaking Agatha awake. “Happy birthday!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled and hid her face in the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no.” Rio got her to turn back over. “You need to wake up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked up at her. “What time is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s just after nine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, it’s a Sunday! And my head hurts. Did I drink vodka last night?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we had shots.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha covered her face with her hands. “I hate vodka.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on. I have the whole day planned.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t we have a lazy morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kicked her feet in annoyance, before getting out of bed and stomping to the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     With a grin, Rio headed back into the kitchen. She
     <em>
      may
     </em>
     have borrowed Agatha’s keys to run to the bakery across the street and begged the owner to sell her some fresh pastries before they opened, praying Agatha didn’t wake up before she got back. She put them all on a plate and prepared them both a cup of coffee, arranging it all on the dining table until it looked as close to perfect as she could get it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha emerged in one of her big t-shirts, her hair an unruly nest. Rio smiled. She looked so adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     “When did you do all this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have my ways,” Rio grinned. “Come sit, M’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes but sat down anyway and picked up a croissant. “So, what are we actually doing today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just give me a clue?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. She loved the way she said that word, like it stripped her of all her power.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can tell you that the first stop we’re making is my apartment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Oh really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So I can get changed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t you wear that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her Fleetwood Mac shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could, but I’d be underdressed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what should I wear?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned at her. “I’ll help you pick.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a bite out of her croissant and seemed to give up arguing for now, though Rio knew she would start again soon. When left at a disadvantage, Agatha was like cornered cat, and her defence was the sharpness of her tongue. She just hoped she would soften when she started enjoying herself, otherwise it would all end in disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     The argument came as they were getting dressed after yet another heated shower. Rio had suspected this, but it wasn’t about what she expected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please borrow something of mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I still need to give you back those jeans,” Rio insisted as she put the dress on from the night before. “We’re literally going from your apartment to your car, then out of the car to my apartment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll catch a chill.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No I won’t.” Rio finished putting her dress on and smoothed it at the sides. “See, all good.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, but I’m lending you my coat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t argue with that “So, what do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at herself in the mirror and smiled approvingly. Rio was actually quite proud of the outfit she’d put together: black leather pants with a navy button up over the top. It did the trick for what they were doing that day, and Agatha did look relieved when she handed it to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you worry we were going hiking or something?” Rio teased, making Agatha chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know what to think.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked over and hugged her from behind, staring at their shared reflection. “I promise it’s nothing bad. I didn’t have time to book the skydiving experience, so it’s pretty boring really.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and leaned back against her. “I’m sorry. I’ll try to be more laid back, I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I know you like to be in control but letting me take the lead sometimes won’t hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we still talking about my birthday, or...”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hugged her tighter. “Oh we are so continuing this conversation later.”
    </p>
<p>
     They headed over to Rio’s apartment, only to find it quiet and still.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia must have gone out,” Agatha commented, but Rio was suspicious. There was no evidence that any form of breakfast had been made, and when she cautiously peaked into Lilia’s room, she found the bed made with a fresh set of pyjamas folded at the foot of the mattress. Had Lilia even come home?
    </p>
<p>
     She dropped Lilia a text before she led Agatha into her room. After a quick interaction with Webbers, which had Agatha fleeing to the far side of the room, Rio starts to get changed. Pulling up her smartest pair of black pants, she matched it with a white button up and blazer.
    </p>
<p>
     All the while, she could feel Agatha’s eyes on her, and when she turned, she found Agatha had laid out on the bed, resting on her side with her head propped up by one arm. Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want me to draw you like one of my French girls?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There better not be any French girls…” Agatha grumbled as she sat up.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m too busy with my sassy American,” Rio teased as she picked up the envelope on her desk. She sat cross-legged on the bed in front of Agatha and handed it over with a nervous smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Present number one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned. “There’s more than one?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept her eyes on her as she opened the envelope, before looking down to what lay within. She laughed at the front of the card. Rio had done a lot of searching to find the right one for this gift, and the delight in Agatha’s eyes made it worth it.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s your birthday,” Agatha read aloud, “you’re allowed to buy more books.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Read out the inside,” Rio prompted, eager for her to get to the actual gift part. Agatha eyed her suspiciously before opening the card.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy birthday Agatha! Your first gift is also your first activity of the day. This card allows you a personal shopping spree at the book shop of your choice. The rules are that you have exactly one hour upon entering the store to pick which books you would like, but they must also all be carriable by the gorgeous Rio Vidal, without the helps of bags or baskets- just pure upper body strength. Good luck!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted with laughter, and Rio had never been so endeared in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     “So we can go anywhere?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anywhere,” Rio confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “And as many books as I want within the hour?”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as I can carry them, yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned, leaning over to kiss Rio sweetly. “Thank you. This is amazing!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You should search up where you want to go, then we’ll get a cab.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can drive,” Agatha insisted. “And I already know where. Do we have some spare time in the schedule?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio checked the time. “Yeah, why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer, just pulled her into another kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     There were in the midst of a heavy make-out session when Rio heard the front door shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that Lilia?” She slid out from under Agatha and went to look. Sure enough, Lilia was in the kitchen pouring herself a glass of water, still in her clothes from the night before, her make up gone and hair dishevelled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio whistled. “Is this a walk of shame I see.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Lilia asked. “I thought you’d be camping at Agatha’s.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We were. I just needed to change. Right, babe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s right,” Agatha said as she walked out of the bedroom. She looked Lilia up and down, a mischievous smirk growing on her lips. “Looks like we aren’t the only one who got lucky last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, alright.” Lilia waved them off. “Excuse me for having fun in my golden years.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grimaced. “No more information, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms, her expression turned serious. “I hope you got my assistant home safely.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon is just fine,” Lilia assured. “As for me, I have a hangover, and I didn’t get much sleep last night…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a gagging noise.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shook her head and carried her glass back to her room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, and happy birthday, Agatha,” she said before shutting the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled. “I can’t believe she got laid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, she’s a handsome lady,” Agatha argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Rio put her hands on her hips. “Am I handsome?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.” Agatha stepped forward and wrapped her arms around her, pulling their bodies together. “You’re beyond what words could possible describe.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “Harkness, you flirt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up and come on. You promised me book shopping.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hang on.” Rio rushed into her bedroom and grabbed the large bag filled with all she would need for the day. She checked everything was there and grinned. As long as everything went to plan, this would be the best day ever.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t look in the bag!” Rio insisted as she scurried by Agatha to the door, who make a show of rolling her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know when someone tells me not to do something…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed dramatically. “Anything for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned back at her. “Anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Within reason.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll certainly be a topic for our second shopping trip of the day.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had to stop herself from laughing when she saw Agatha’s eyes widen. “Rio, what…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on,” she prompted. “We have stuff to do!”
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Agatha enter a bookstore was a sight she didn’t know she needed. Her face lit up with excitement, like a kid at Christmas, her eyes darting around to take it all in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped her just before the threshold. “The minute you step inside, the timer starts.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Does it include paying time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought for a moment. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Get that timer ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio set it up on her phone and hovered her thumb over the start button. “Whenever you’re ready, my sweet little nerd.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a warning look before rushing inside. With a chuckle, Rio started the timer and raced after her.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew Agatha was a passionate person. Their few days as physical lovers were enough to prove that. Yet this…this was something else. Agatha raced through the store, her fingers tracing the spines of books as she read each title. It had surprised Rio that she didn’t have her hands full already, but Agatha had only picked out two books:
     <em>
      The Mercies
     </em>
     and a fancy copy of the complete words of Emily Dickinson. Though the latter was a brick in itself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you really going to read this?” Rio asked, earning a confused look. She realised then that was a stupid question. So instead, she chose another. “When am I going to read something you’ve written?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t write anymore,” Agatha explained. “Well, not much. Sometimes when I’m bored on a weekend, but I can’t see that happening again anytime soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So I’m distracting you from writing the next great American novel?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re distracting me from wasting my time on something no one will ever read.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her and picked another book off the shelf:
     <em>
      The Witches, Salem 1962
     </em>
     . Rio didn’t know why she wanted that one, but she decided it was best not to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the timer went off, the book tower in her arms was pushing up against her chin, and Agatha smiled so brightly it made the ache in her neck more than worth it. She told Agatha to wait while she paid, and was glad Alice had sent her some royalties money the week before. Why were books so expensive?
    </p>
<p>
     With the books secured with Rio’s bag of tricks in the trunk of Agatha’s car, they set off again. Rio checked her watch. They were right on schedule. She directed Agatha to park on a street not far from her apartment and led her towards a restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     “A romantic meal for two?” Agatha teased as they headed inside.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “Not quite.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could question her words, a body collided with hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy birthday Agatha!” Billy hugged her close. Agatha wrapped her arms around him immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, what a lovely surprise,” she said, her voice muffled into his shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked over to Rebecca and Jeff, who were still sat at their table. Jeff gave her a thumbs up and Rebecca offered an approving nod. Looking back, she saw Billy pull out of the hug, only to take Agatha’s hand and lead her to the table.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked back at Rio, her face alight with genuine happiness.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Thank you,’ she mouthed, and Rio couldn’t help but grin as she followed them.  So far, so good.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Can we get dessert this time?” Billy asked as they finished their light meals. Mostly sandwiches and small pasta plates, but Agatha wouldn’t have swapped it even for a Michelin star dinner.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” both his parents said in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway,” Rio pipped up. “We need to exchange presents.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah yes.” Rebecca brought out a gift bag from underneath the table and handed it over. “This is from me and Jeff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took the bag and opened her card before digging into the gift. Her sister knew her well. She had gotten her a small
     <em>
      Coach
     </em>
     crossbody bag, simple yet stylish.
    </p>
<p>
     “You said you wanted a new bag for the gala,” Rebecca reminded her. “I know you have expensive taste, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it,” Agatha assured. “It is most definitely coming to the gala with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What gala?” Rio frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure I told you. My work has a gala every year. I got two tickets.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope so.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, her adorable little tooth-gap on full display. “When is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not this coming Friday, the Friday after.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got out her phone and Agatha watched her put it in her diary. Suddenly, the gala was something she was looking forward to.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy got out a wrapped present and handed it across the table. “This is from me and Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was Billy’s idea,” Rio was quick to insist. “I just helped a little.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked between them both suspiciously before opening the present, revealing a thin cardboard box. Inside was a folded picture frame. Opening it up, she gasped, tears instantly prickling at her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     The frame opened into three and Billy had already filled two of the frames: one with the picture of her and Rio at the botanical gardens, and the other one of the selfies Billy and Rio took earlier that week. The middle frame was left blank.
    </p>
<p>
     “The last one is for a picture of the three of us,” Billy explained. “We’re going to get a photos when we’re all done here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached across and hugged him tight. She loved that boy more than words could express. Then, her attention turned to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, my love.” She kissed her cheek as close to her lips as she could get. “You’re really making me feel special today.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good because you are,” Rio responded with a sweet smile. “Also, I hope it means you won’t kill me for this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What…”
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha saw it.
    </p>
<p>
     The candle-covered cake heading her way. She hid her face in her hands as the full restaurant sang to her, but what they didn’t know was that she was secretly smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     After enjoying her birthday cake and taking some pictures in the park opposite (which she wasn’t allowed to see until Billy picked the one he wanted for the frame), she and Rio bid her family farewell.
    </p>
<p>
     Jeff pulled her into a big bear hug. “Next year I want Rio to organise us a joint birthday. She’s surprisingly good at this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve trained her well,” Agatha teased, glancing over to where Rio was chatting with Rebecca while Billy practically hung off her arm. Yet when he noticed his aunt’s arms were free, he quickly turned to give her another hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope you’re having the best day,” he told her. “You deserve to be spoilt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Now I know how you feel every day of the year,” she teased him, before getting on her tip toes to kiss his forehead. “Thanks kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t thank me. Thank Rio. I messaged her panicking, and she helped me sort it out. I picked the photos though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. Her nephew was beautifully honest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca then hurried her son away so she could have her hug. “Happy birthday, big sis.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, little pain in my ass.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca chuckled before leaning in to her ear. “She’s a keeper.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Agatha answered, stealing a glance at Rio, who looked to be creating a secret handshake with her nephew and brother-in-law.
    </p>
<p>
     She was
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     going to reward her for all this later.
    </p>
<p>
     Once her family were gone, they climbed back into the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Agatha asked. “What next?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and pulled another envelope out of her pocket. “Here you go, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Another card?” she asked as she opened the envelope. “How many did you buy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just one more after this one.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha saw the card, she burst out laughing. “Happy birthday Lickalottapus?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and pointed to the cartoon stegosaurus. “See, you’re the lesbian dinosaur.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How the hell did you find this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gay village.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay so this time I won’t make you read it out loud.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha narrowed her eyes yet again, before opening the card to read the message within.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Happy birthday (again) Agatha!
     </em>
</p>
<p>

      This shopping trip is going to be a bit more…adult than the last. You may have a whole sex shop under your bed, but there’s no harm in adding more to the collection, so feel free to take another shopping trip to your favourite adult store! However, there are some rules. This time, you must walk around the shop in silence before heading back to the car, while your ever-observant lover, Rio Vidal, will aim to get you exactly what you want.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Can you trust her to get what you most desire? Only time will tell…
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at Rio, who was watching her closely with those big brown eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope you brought a change of clothes in that bag of tricks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “Oh sweetie, you have no idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s favourite store was on the other side of town. It was tucked out of the way, so discreet you wouldn’t know it was there without a google search. Still, it’s catalogue was…extensive.
    </p>
<p>
     She walked inside, well aware of Rio’s silent presence behind her, and began to peruse the aisles. Her imagine ran wild, as it always did, but instead of picturing some random faceless woman, it was Rio. In all honesty, it had been Rio for a year, but this time she could picture it so clearly. The way her back arched, how her breasts bounced with every inward thrust, how her body gladly took everything she had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
     It took all of Agatha’s self-control not to drag Rio back to the car and have her in the back seat. But she didn’t. She did as she was told and walked back to the car alone. She sat there in silence for a few minutes, before getting out her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     She had a message from Jen.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Happy birthday loser. Has Rio given you our gifts yet?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Thanks geek. And not yet.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Jen replied quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Ah so you’re still on your big day out. Rio’s still alive, then?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      For now, yes.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was then Agatha saw Rio approaching, swinging a large bag in her hand. She watched her climb into the passenger seat and put the bag in the footwell.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you get?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can look later. Now, let’s head home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha expected the rest of the afternoon be spent in bed with Rio and whatever she had purchased for her at the store.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, they were watching
     <em>
      The Babadook
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     “Gay icon,” Rio kept commenting, and Agatha had no idea what she was on about, but the film was fine and getting to snuggle with her girlfriend was even better.
    </p>
<p>
     Halfway through the film, however, Rio’s phone rang. Agatha caught sight of the screen and saw it was Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio jumped up as she answered it. “I’ll be right down, Al.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hanging up the phone, she paused the movie and ran to the door. “Can I borrow your keys? Alice has brought me something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Agatha answered, watching her snatch up the keys and rush out of the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     Shaking her head, her attention soon shifted to the bags on her dining table. There were the gifts from her family, which she had already opened, the books, which she knew of, and the bag from the adult store, which she could hazard a guess at. Rio’s bag? That was a whole other story.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to peak. Wanted to have an idea what Rio had in there. But she knew her love would be disappointed if she ruined the surprise, so she stayed put on the couch, and waited.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned with two gift bags and a brown paper one of groceries. She dumped the gift bags with the rest on the table before putting the groceries in the fridge.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is that for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Another present,” Rio answered. “I’m cooking you dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Don’t worry it’s more like my version of tapas.”
    </p>
<p>
     That didn’t fill Agatha with much enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “What kind of tapas?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop asking questions you won’t get the answers to,” Rio said teasingly as she moved back over. “Now let’s see what the Babadook is up to.”
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the credits rolled, they were making out on the couch, and Agatha had her hand up Rio’s shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved that she didn’t wear underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet when her hand shifted lower, Rio pulled it back. “Not yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned. “Rio, I’m dying here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked before shifting to stand. “Let’s open your gifts.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio retrieved the two gift bags, and something from her mysterious bag of tricks. Sitting cross-legged on the couch, she handed over the first bag.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is from Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “I already know what this is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Opening the bag, she rummaged through the bottles of Kale Kate products. “Every year. At least it’s good stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha set the bag aside and accepted the next one Rio handed over.
    </p>
<p>
     “And this is from Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened it up and pulled out what appeared to be a black t shirt. Unfolding it, she laughed when she saw the design.
    </p>
<p>
     “A Lorna Wu shirt?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a prototype from when a store wanted to do a range based around Mom. It fell through, but we got some cool t shirts out of it. My one request is please don’t wear it while we have sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled as she carefully folded up the shirt again. “Tell Alice thanks from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will.” Rio then held out the next gift to her. “And this is from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was a jewellery box, too big for a ring, but had a purple velvet case that Agatha was instantly obsessed with. Accepting it, she carefully lifted the lid and gasped.
    </p>
<p>
     There, resting on a long gold chain, was a half a golden heart. The metal with thin and stylish, and the moment Agatha felt it, she knew it was real gold.
    </p>
<p>
     She met Rio’s nervous expression with a grin. “This is beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You like it?” Rio asked hopefully. “It’s not too much?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s perfect.” She leaned across and gave Rio a quick kiss. “I’ve always wanted one of these.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have?”
    </p>
<p>
     She nodded, before frowning. “Speaking of which, where’s yours?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched as Rio pulled a matching necklace out from under her shirt. She held her half of the heart up, and with a chuckle Agatha brought hers up. Together, they made the heart whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s tapas consisted of fries, tater tots, chicken nuggets and…dino nuggets.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, just try one,” Rio pleaded. “You’ll like it. I promise!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up the offending piece of food. This one was a t-rex. Eyeing it cautiously, she slowly brought it to her mouth and bit the head off. Savouring the taste, she shrugged. “Tastes like a chicken nugget to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh come on! They’re dino shaped! Tell me you didn’t enjoy biting off its head.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “My girlfriend, the dinosaur killer.”
    </p>
<p>
     She expected Rio to laugh, but instead she stared at her with wide eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asked this time, suddenly nervous.
    </p>
<p>
     “Y-your girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m your girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart dropped. Had she totally misread everything? “Aren’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her a few more moments, before her face split into a wide grin. “I’m your girlfriend! I’m actually your girlfriend!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at her antics. “Yes, and I’m yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re my girlfriend!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha continued to chuckle as Rio got to her feet, only stopping when her girlfriend climbed into her lap and kissed her passionately. Running her hands up Rio’s back, the dinosaur nuggets were quickly forgotten.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, breathless. “I have one last present. I just need to go to the bedroom. I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and watched Rio pick up both her mystery bag and the adult store bag, before disappearing into the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     She locked eyes with Senõr Scratchy, who had long since finished his own dinner. “Guess I better say good night now, buddy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually Rio told her to come through, and Agatha all but ran across the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Close your eyes!” Rio instructed, and Agatha covered her eyes with her hand as she pushed through the door. Blindly walking into the room, she kept going until Rio told her to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     “Open your eyes, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved her hand away, and she was sure her heart stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was laid out on the pillows again, her legs crossed over each other seductively, wearing a mint green slip and panties, her nipples pointed under the shining silk. The two toys rested unboxed on the bed beside her. The first was an obvious one: a new dildo that Rio had picked out in a deep green. The second, well, Agatha had even surprised herself with that one.
     <br/>
     It was technically a double-sided dildo, but one end was much shorter, making it more like a strapless strap on. The idea hadn’t appealed to her before, but the thought of being able to feel each thrust she gave Rio…that was certainly an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     At the foot of the bed, was another card. Agatha ripped the envelope open, and she couldn’t help but laugh. On it was a cartoon peach, with ‘Happy Birthday Peachy Butt’ written underneath. She met Rio’s gaze again before opening the card. The message inside was simple.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘Fuck me birthday girl.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She looked up at Rio again, who simply smirked back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Want to unwrap your present?”
    </p>
<p>
     Then, Agatha was on her.
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed hot and fast, before Agatha moved downwards. She mouthed at her silk-covered breast, marvelling in her sharp moans.
    </p>
<p>
     That was it. She needed her now.
     <br/>
     Quickly stripping off her clothes, Agatha reached for her harness and grabbed the green dildo. The strapless strap was something they’d have to lead up to, but this would be more than enough tonight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do I need to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Already clean,” Rio assured. “How do you want me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Putting on the harness, Agatha lay down on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sit on my face.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha settled herself against the pillows. “Come on. I want to taste you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kicked off her panties and climbed over her, her thighs either side of Agatha’s head as she knelt above her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared upwards, the sight the closest to godliness she had ever been. Until Rio finally lowered herself, that was.
    </p>
<p>
     Her entire face got to work: her lips, her tongue, even her nose, which seemed to make Rio squeak. Staring up from between her thighs, she saw her girlfriend had gripped the headboard as she rocked her hips, her head thrown back in pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped her thighs, digger her nails into her skin as she controlled her movements.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio’s hips got faster, her moans got even louder, and Agatha could help but feel a little smug. Soon, Rio groaned with release, and Agatha licked up some of it, before pushing Rio back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get on me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her with hooded eyes, breathless from her orgasm. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ride me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought you liked being on top?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Honey, just because I’m on my back doesn’t mean I’m not on top.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved to sit on her stomach, the wet press of her hot against her skin while the lace edge of the slip brushed against her in light tickles.
    </p>
<p>
     A lazy finger traced the line of Agatha’s nose, making her stare up at her in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love your nose,” Rio commented. “I always have, but I love it even more now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched as Rio shifted back further, kneeling over her with the green rod stood between her thighs. She bit her lip. This was going to be a sight to behold.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up and reached down to position the strap for her, allowing Rio to brace herself on her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “You ready?” She could see there was a little bit of nervousness in her lover’s eyes, and she wanted to reach for the trusty bottle in her nightstand. Anything to make her more comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, Rio nodded, squeezing against her shoulders as she brought herself down.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her, careful not to move as Rio lifted herself up again, letting out a deep groan as she pushed back down.
    </p>
<p>
     Another lift and she pressed down, then she was all the way in. Rio moaned and rested their foreheads together.
    </p>
<p>
     Running her hands up her back, Agatha leaned in and kissed her softly. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio needed, before pushing Agatha back down against the pillows. A lustful grin appeared on her lips. “Never better, peachy butt.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked as Rio started rocking her hips, relishing the sight of her eyes fluttering closed as soft gasps felt her lips. Her hands found purchase on Rio’s hips, helping guide her movements, hypnotised by the way her chest bounced under the silk with each rock forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon, Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. She grasped her hips harder and drove up into her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh fuck!” Rio’s hand flew back, gripping Agatha’s thigh for support. Her hips moved faster, now in a deliberate up and down motion. Her cheeks were now flushed, her hair falling in front of her face. She looked devine.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted so her feet were flat on the mattress, giving her the leverage she needed. The grind of Rio’s hips was pressing the strap against her. Not enough to bring her to the edge, but enough to chase the sensation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Imagine this with our other new toy,” Rio told her breathlessly. “Imagine being able to feel every time you thrust into me.”
    </p>
<p>
     The thought made Agatha groan, arching her hips even further of the bed. Whatever she did, it sent Rio into a frenzy, riding her with pure desperation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please do that again. Please, please, please, please…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arched her hips again, and again, and again, before holding Rio to her and watching the silent cry of ecstasy wash over her face.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt wetness cover her crotch, thighs, even her stomach, and she couldn’t help but bask in the smug pride of her achievement.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fell down on top of her, burying her face in her neck as her body continued to twitch. Agatha stroked her back again, trying to ignore the desire between her own legs. She carefully maneuvered Rio’s hips enough to slide out of her, before settling her back comfortably once more.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t sure how long they lay there, and as Rio’s breaths slowed and her body relaxed, Agatha thought she’d fallen into a post-orgasm slumber. Until her girlfriend lifted her head, and stared at her with eyes so dark she couldn’t distinguish iris from pupil.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never done that before,” Rio admitted. “That was…I mean I’ve made girls do that before, but I’ve never…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha admitted. “One of my ex’s said I’m too tightly wound.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “I’d better unwind you then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you make those other girls do it?” Agatha asked curiously to which Rio blushed.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was, erm, when I was wearing the strap.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Oh?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Seems I’m quite good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Thoughts invaded Agatha’s head, and she quickly pushed them away. Instead, she cupped Rio’s cheek and placed a soft kiss against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for today. I was worried, but it’s been perfect.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It could have been better, but you didn’t give me enough notice. But there is always next year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Next year?” Agatha asked as Rio’s lips latched on to her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, and the next one and the next one and the next one…” Rio chanted it over and over as she trailed kisses between her breasts and down her stomach. She unfastened the harness and Agatha lifted her hips so she could remove it, tutting when Rio just threw it on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, that was covered in…”
    </p>
<p>
     Then Rio swiped her tongue between her folds, and she forgot about it in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ate her like she was some kind of delicacy. All consuming, but also savouring, giving Agatha the most delicious flutters of pleasure. Her fingers laced in Rio’s hair as her other held on to the sheet below her, scared she would float away.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel herself building, like she was soaring up to the clouds. Higher, higher, higher…
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, kneeling between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her with a frustrated glower. “Rio, please…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to make you feel good, Agatha.” Rio climbed up until she was hovering over her, a hand still loitering between her legs. “Can I?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded urgently. “Yes, please. Please let me come.”
    </p>
<p>
     Two fingers slid inside her, and Agatha threw her head back in ecstasy. It took ten thrusts, fifteen if she wanted to save face, before her back arched off the bed, and pleasure ripped through her like a hurricane.
    </p>
<p>
     As it settled, she stared up at the goddess above her, bare and breathless.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled out her fingers and sucked them into her mouth. She stole a glance to the left, and smirked. “It’s not even eight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, still in the haze of her orgasm. “I’m sure we’ll be able to entertain ourselves.”
    </p>
<p>
     The next morning, Agatha didn’t want to go to work. She really didn’t. It took everything in her to get up, to get ready. To kiss a sleepy Rio goodbye, lending her the apartment keys and holding to Rio’s promise that she’d drop them off for her at the office after her midday class.
    </p>
<p>
     She was twenty minutes late when she strode across the floor to her office, a large black coffee in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon,” she called out as she approached her assistant’s desk. “Move any meetings from midday onwards and get me a copy of that manuscript Mike emailed me about on Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon jumped out from behind her desk. “Agatha, before you go in…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, and I hope you had fun on Saturday,” Agatha said she reached for her office door. “You and Lilia seemed to hit it off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but listen, I told h…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was the most spectacular weekend,” Agatha told her smile an uncontrollable smile. “The best birthday I’ve ever had.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s nice, bu…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll just answer some emails, then I’ll come tell you all about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, wai…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped into her office, the door swinging shut behind her, her thoughts clouded by the memories of the days before. Of Rio, of her girlfriend, of the woman who now owned her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     That was until she saw the figure stood by her desk. Their back was to her, but she knew exactly who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Her smile dropped along with her heart. Suddenly ever ounce of happiness had been sucked from her body, replaced with the bitter memories of heartache.
    </p>
<p>
     Her visitor turned to look at her, the framed photo of her and Billy cradled in their hands. They looked the same. Same full lips, same sharp emerald eyes, the same auburn locks framing their face.
    </p>
<p>
     Her visitor smiled; a smile Agatha had hoped to never see again. “Hello Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened, the name tasting bitter on her tongue. “Hello Wanda.”

<p>
     Wanda Maximoff was the same as she always was. Noticeably older, likely thanks to her little rugrats running wild, but she was still put together, still statuesque, still beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     Nevertheless, Agatha hated the sight of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing in my office?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda ignored her, instead looking down at the frame in her hands. “William looks so grown up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stormed forward and snatched the frame from her. “It’s Billy now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Wanda said with a smirk. “Your sister told me a while back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop talking to my sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t have to if you talked to me yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her comment. “Why are you in my office?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought it would be best to come break the ice, seeing as we are going to be working together again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Please, we’re barely going to see each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda frowned. “You don’t know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Know what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re my point person in the company.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Agatha couldn’t believe this. She
     <em>
      wouldn’t
     </em>
     believe this. “Why? My job has nothing to do with your silly little drawings.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Illustrations,” Wanda corrected. “And I requested you. I was told you agreed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d never agree to this!” Agatha insisted. “And why the hell would you want me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re a good team,” Wanda replied. “We always have been.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, so good you left me. Cheated on me too, I might add.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Get out of my office.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sighed and walked past her to the door. “We will be working together, Agatha. You’ll have to at least tolerate me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have to do anything,” Agatha bit back, but it only made Wanda smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Agatha, you haven’t changed at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as the door shut, Agatha let out a frustrated growl and threw her handbag angrily on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “SHARON!”
    </p>
<p>
     Her assistant crept into the office. “I’m sorry, Agatha. I tried to stop her and I-I tried to warn you...”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held up a hand to silence her. “Next time that woman comes anywhere near my office, call security.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she works...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Security, Sharon,” she insisted. “Right away.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded and promptly fled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paced her office floor. How had this happened? Why did the execs do this? She had made it very clear how she felt about the merger. How could they think this was a good idea?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Because they were peabrains
     </em>
     , she thought bitterly.
    </p>
<p>
     But why did Wanda think she had agreed to this? She most certainly had not. Someone had been telling tall tales, and she was going to find out who!
    </p>
<p>
     Storming towards the elevators, she headed up to her boss’ office. His assistant tried to stop her, but she marched in anyway. Mike was sat behind his desk, typing away on his computer. He looked up and offered her a smile. “Good morning, Agatha. How can I help you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I don’t know,” she began, her voice laced with sarcasm. “Maybe you could explain to me why Wanda fucking Maximoff was in my office just now saying I’m her point person?”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike’s smile dropped. “Listen, Agatha...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t Agatha me. She seems to think I’ve agreed to something I certainly did not. Why is that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Technically, you did agree.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When”? She demanded. “Because there is no possible scenario in which I would even consider agreeing to this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When your partner went to hospital last week, you said you were fine with anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Shit.
    </p>
<p>
     “How is your partner, by the way?
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio is fine,” she answered, before pressing on. “I wish you wouldn’t have made such a decision without me. And I’ll tell you now, I will not be working with Wanda Maximoff in any way shape or form.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she wants you,” Mike argued. “The merger isn’t finalised for another thirty days. We need to keep her happy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well find someone else to do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t, Agatha. I’m sorry...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry isn’t good enough!” she snapped. “You have until Friday to fix this, or you’ll be getting my resignation first thing Monday morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you don’t mean...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I do,” she said vehemently. “I’d rather be flipping burgers than work with her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike stared at her for a moment. “Is there more than a professional history between you two?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed and walked out. Men were so stupid (besides her darling nephew, of course).
    </p>
<p>
     She headed back to her own office, slamming the door behind her. Needing to call her sister, she got her phone out of her bag, only to freeze when she saw her lock screen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     How was she going to explain this to her? Would she be upset? Would she be annoyed? She had to fix it. She couldn’t allow the slightest chance of this ruining their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     She called Rebecca, and her sister picked up on the third ring.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hey sis.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What’s wrong?”
     </em>
     Rebecca was quick to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes. “I’ve just seen Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “What? Where?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “In my office. She requested for me to be her person during the merger, and my stupid boss agreed.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Shit.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I demanded that she works with someone else, but my boss said there’s nothing he can do. I threatened to quit…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha, no,”
     </em>
     her sister was quick to interrupt.
     <em>
      “You can’t quit over this.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Then what should I do?” Agatha asked. “What should I tell Rio?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Just tell her you’ve seen her until you know what’s going on,”
     </em>
     Rebecca advised.
     <em>
      “There’s no need to make her upset if you can sort it out.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Do you intend to work with her?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed sharply. “I don’t even intend to look at her.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Well then.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha contemplated her options. “I don’t want to lie to her.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You’re not. You’re telling her you’re working together, which is true, and that you want nothing to do with her, which is also true.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca sighed.
     <em>
      “Remember Callum?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “No?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “My boyfriend in freshman year of college. The guy I brought home for thanksgiving.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rat face?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “He was handsome!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I was relieved when you brought Jeff home, and that’s saying something.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You like Jeff. Don’t lie.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “He’s family now. I don’t have a choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both knew that wasn’t true.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Anyway, back when I was working as a clerk, before Billy’s accident, he showed up for a week. Turns out he worked at another branch and wanted to show us how to use a new company-wide software. We spoke maybe twice that whole time, because we were pretty much strangers. Both with our own spouses and families. I told Jeff I’d seen him, of course, but I didn’t say I’d be with him all week.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “It stopped any drama, because we know nothing is going on, but they can’t help but worry.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio does get jealous,” Agatha mused. “She has no reason to be though. I would never look at anyone else.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Look at you all domesticated.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re literally a stay-at-home mom, and anyway I still don’t like this. Rio deserves the full truth.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Well that’s up to you,”
     </em>
     Rebecca answered.
     <em>
      “But while you’re telling her the truth, there’s probably some other things you should tell her.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Like what?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “For starters, about what happened with Billy.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s stomach dropped. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I said no.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “She deserves to know. She’s practically family now. It won’t change anything.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I know but…I don’t want to relive it, okay?” Agatha would rather relive every cruel moment with her mother than a single second of that time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You know it wasn’t your fault,”
     </em>
     Rebecca argued.
     <em>
      “It was an accident. You weren’t…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Rebecca, can we please not talk about this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her sister sighed.
     <em>
      “Fine, then at least tell her the other thing she needs to know.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Which is?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “That you love her.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s entire body tensed. “I-wha-I-how…”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha Harkness, you love that woman. I can see it, everyone else can see it. Just tell her already.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m not ready yet.” There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment Agatha thought she’d hung up. “Rebecca?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You’re waiting for her to say it first, aren’t you?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “What?! No!”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Yes, you are. Are you worried she won’t say it back? Because she’s obviously crazy about you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m not worried,” Agatha insisted.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Then what is it?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked out of her office window to the city skyline. “This is different. She’s different.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “And that’s good, right?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “It is, but I’ve always been the one in charge. I’ve always been in control of myself, and the situation. Then with Rio, there keeps being these moments when I’m not and…I don’t think I’ve ever felt so much like myself than when I’m with her. The real me. The one who didn’t end up being completely fucked up.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You’re not fucked up.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “I am, Rebecca. I’ve done well for myself, but that isn’t going to change the past. I’m still going to have nightmares, I’m still not going to relate when people talk about their favourite book as a kid, or when they talk about how their mom is like their best friend. Sometimes I get asked to read something out loud in a meeting, and I’m back in fifth grade with everyone laughing at me because I couldn’t read it.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Agatha…”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “But with Rio I forget about all that. She just gets me, as cheesy as that sounds.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I can see that. Look, it seems to me you have three things to tell her. Pick one and tell her the next time you see her. The rest is up to you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “How do I know I won’t mess all this up?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You don’t,”
     </em>
     Rebecca answered.
     <em>
      “Just have faith you’re doing the right thing.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     They said their goodbyes, and Agatha hung up the phone. She thought for a moment, before setting a new plan in motion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon! I’m leaving for the day!”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio, on the other hand, was having a fantastic day.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun was shining, her class had been riveting, and she had her girlfriend’s apartment keys rattling in her pocket as she walked out of the lecture building.
    </p>
<p>
     Girlfriend. Her girlfriend, Agatha. Agatha Harkness, her gorgeous girlfriend. Rio grinned to herself. It felt amazing no matter how she worded it.
    </p>
<p>
     As she walked down the steps out of the building, she swore her preoccupied mind was playing tricks on her. It wouldn’t be the first time she thought she’d seen her. In their year apart, she had thought she’d seen Agatha across the street, in crowded bars, in the line at coffee shops. This time, however, she didn’t change into a stranger the moment Rio blinked. Instead, she smiled back at her as she leant against her car.
    </p>
<p>
     It took everything in Rio not to run towards her, and instead quickly weaving through the sea of students to reach her girlfriend at a socially acceptable speed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed herself off the car, and Rio soon found herself in a warm embrace. She smiled against her girlfriend’s strong shoulder, before pressing a light kiss to her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is the best surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back, cupping her face. She smiled, but Rio could see her eyes were troubled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I needed to see you,” Agatha admitted. “I missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I missed you too.” Rio searched her face. “What’s wrong? Has something happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, plastering on a confident smile that Rio saw right through. “Fancy playing hooky with me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew something wasn’t right, knew Agatha was deflecting, and she planned to find out more later. Yet when those blue eyes looked at her so pleadingly, how could she say no?
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever shall we do? Go kiss under the bleachers?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “How about somewhere a little more private?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached into her pocket, pulling out Agatha’s keys. She held them up so they swayed between them. “I know a place.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took the keys, their fingers brushing as she did. “Let’s get out of here.”
    </p>
<p>
     No less than an hour later, Rio was naked, her head resting on Agatha’s expensive pillows as she stared up at the ceiling, one arm thrown lazily above her head, while the other reached down to run her fingers through the mass of messy hair that had taken up residence between her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had made her come three times already, all with her tongue, which still worked away as Rio rode the aftermath of that third orgasm. She wanted to pull Agatha up, to kiss her and return the favour, but she knew she shouldn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     It seemed her girlfriend had something on her mind, and if eating her out made her feel better, Rio wasn’t going to stop her. That was until she left hersensitive skin becoming sore, and she had no choice but to tug lightly on her lover’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, stop.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her head instantly. “Are you okay? Did I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re perfect,” Rio assured. “Just come up here.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could tell Agatha didn’t want to. That she wanted to remain in the sanctuary she had made herself between her thighs, but climbed up anyway, laying down on her stomach beside her, propping up her head to look down at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so beautiful,” Agatha praised, making Rio chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re the beautiful one,” she insisted. “I’ve memorised every feature of your face.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an amused eyebrow. “You have?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “And that’s how I know that there is something troubling you. I can see it in your eyes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip, averting her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Rio reached up to cup her cheek. “You know you can talk to me. About anything, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, before looking up at Rio, blue eyes wide and nervous. “Do you promise you’ll let me explain before you get mad?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart dropped. Fuck, this was serious.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she nodded and braced herself for impact.
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw Wanda at work today.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw Wanda,” Agatha repeated. “You know, my ex.”
    </p>
<p>
     Despite her relief it wasn’t something devastatingly serious, Rio remained concerned. “What? When? How?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She was in my office when I got there this morning. She said she wanted to break the ice seeing we are going to be working together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “And it turns out, I may have accidentally agreed to be her point person during the merger.”
    </p>
<p>
     The relief was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows. “You
     <em>
      accidentally
     </em>
     agreed?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a long story…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is,” Rio grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is!” Agatha insisted. “It was a huge misunderstanding, and I’m trying to fix it. I’m not working with that woman.”
    </p>
<p>
     Still, Rio didn’t understand. “But why would they put you together in the first place?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda requested me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but laugh. “Wow, okay. Should I be worried?”
    </p>
<p>
     “About Wanda?” Agatha laughed. “No, of course not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t still have feelings for her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not!”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you agreed to work with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a yes or no question.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you it’s a long story.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay then, tell me this long story. Let me see if you’re going to lie again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “When have I ever lied to you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence fell between them. Rio bit her lip. She shouldn’t have said that. She’d totally overreacted and…
    </p>
<p>
     Realisation crossed Agatha’s face, only to be quickly replaced by anger. “The note? Seriously?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we moved on from this. That stupid note.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We have!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Clearly not.” Agatha got up and shrugged on her robe. “Get changed and get out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m didn’t mean…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you did,” Agatha accused. “Now get changed and get
     <em>
      out
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha storm into the living area, slamming the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     What the fuck just happened?
    </p>
<p>
     Was this it?
    </p>
<p>
     Was that the end?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “Nope, nope, nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     She found her discarded shirt and shoved it on, before marching after her girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was stood in the kitchen, facing away from her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio approached cautiously.  “We need to talk about this, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck off, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, really mature.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Coming from you?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck sake, Agatha. Just come talk about this like a fucking adult.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whirled round to face her. Her face was filled with anguish, but Rio could see her eyes glistened with tears. “I have nothing to say to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, come on. I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha marched across the room and flopped down on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed and followed, perching herself on the edge of the coffee table. “Okay, let’s talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha refused to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You want to know how I ended up in this mess? Because of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When you hurt your knee, I was in a meeting. I told them before I left that I was fine with anything. I just needed to go. To get to you. Turns out this was on the itinerary.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio instantly hated herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “I called Rebecca, you know. I didn’t know what to do because I knew this would put strain on our relationship and I didn’t want that. You know what? She told me to lie because the truth would cause too much trouble. Because you’d get jealous, and it wouldn’t end well. But no, I had to be
     <em>
      honest
     </em>
     because the thought of lying to you hurt me, Rio. It fucking hurt, and then I find out that you just think I’m a big fucking liar anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t,” Rio insisted. “I know you must have just forgotten…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wrote the fucking note, Rio,” Agatha snapped. “I remember it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then where was it?” Rio questioned. “Because I looked everywhere, and I didn’t see it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not my fault you have the attention span of a fruit fly.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chose to ignore that comment. “Agatha, sweetheart, I looked everywhere. Either you hid it well, or you didn’t write it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or you think…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not crazy,” Agatha snapped as she got to her feet. She pointed an accusing finger at Rio. “Maybe
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     are the liar in all this? Did you lose the note then make up this little story to make yourself feel better? Or did you take offense that I didn’t prioritise waking up with you over finding my lost nephew? Because honestly, Rio, I don’t understand. Because the note wasn’t here when I got back, and I know I wrote it. I remember everything about that morning crystal clear.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got to her feet, folding her arms and staring Agatha down. “I’m not lying, Agatha. I’d never lie to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’d never lie to you,” Agatha insisted. “God, I wish I could! I can lie to everyone, but I could never lie to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you are!” Rio felt tears tickle her cheeks, but she didn’t care. “You’re lying right now!”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m not!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, tell me where you put this note? Go on! Tell me!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed bitterly. “You know exactly where I put it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t! I never saw even the hint of a note, and I looked fucking everywhere!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously?! How could you not see it?! I put it right on…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze, the anger fading on her face, replaced with wide-eyed realisation. “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio followed her gaze and met Senõr Scratchy’s blank stare. “Oh.”
    </p>

<div>
<p>
     They stood there in silence, taking in what had just happened. Rio’s mind raced to fit the puzzle of events together.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wrote the note.
    </p>
<p>
     Scratchy ate the note.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t get the note.
    </p>
<p>
     They hated each other for nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so absurd, so ridiculous. Rio couldn’t stop herself from laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” Agatha snapped. “It’s not funny.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not funny?” Rio said through her laughter. “This is hilarious!”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not.” Agatha grabbed her phone off the couch and started tapping away at it, her face set in a scowl.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her nervously. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at Senõr Scratchy with a murderous glare. “Looking up how to make
     <em>
      RABBIT PIE
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     The rabbit just sat there, totally oblivious to the chaos he had caused through his greed. That only made Rio laugh even harder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, this is not
     <em>
      funny
     </em>
     !” Agatha insisted. “He ate the note.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He ate the fucking note, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He must
     <em>
      pay.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, he’s a rabbit. I could put the Declaration of Independence in there and he’d gobble it up without a second thought. Why did you even put it there, anyway? You know he eats paper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha avoided her gaze. “I put it somewhere you’d see it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but why not the fridge, or the front door, or the toilet seat? Literally anywhere else?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha mumbled under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “I thought it would be cute.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “You’ve always been so soft for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop messing!” Agatha snapped. “This is awful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved over to her. “No, it’s not. Yes, it sucked that it happened, but don’t you see? This a good thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because we can finally move on from this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Rio, we can’t just move on from this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I hated you for a year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hated you too, but I don’t anymore.” Quite the opposite, but Rio decided to leave that part for another time. “And I hope you don’t hate me anymore. Right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I don’t hate you, but I did for no reason. I hate that. I hate that I hated you because some stupid fucking rabbit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to Senõr Scratchy and put her middle finger up at him. “Fuck you. Little clit-blocker bunny.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That was foul even for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve said so much worse than that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, but Rio could see the start of a smile. Okay, she could work with that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come, let’s sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     They sat down on the couch, and Agatha quickly reached for her hand. Rio squeezed it, pleased they could still do this, as moments ago she thought they were surely doomed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would never have ghosted you,” Rio insisted. “I was crazy about you from the moment we met.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha insisted. “I wanted to see you again. I waited weeks, just hoping you’d change your mind. It was quite pathetic really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I cried on the couch for three weeks straight,” Rio admitted. “And it wasn’t even my couch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Rio, I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry too, but we made it back to each other in the end.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Back to where we’re meant to be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in and pressed their lips together in a gentle kiss. The kiss didn’t deepen, the only progress being Agatha reaching up to caress her cheek. It wasn’t romantic, or sexual, it was just them. Agatha and Rio, bound by the universe despite the actions of a hungry bunny.
    </p>
<p>
     They pulled back and smiled at each other. It didn’t matter how they got to that moment, but they did, and that’s all either of them cared about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe it’s for the best,” Rio mused. “We’d have probably lasted a week, maybe two if we were lucky.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we’d be married by now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her in surprise. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “I think we’re better for having that time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The time we hated each other?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, the time getting to know each other. That night, you were my dream girl. Now, you’re…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “I’m your what.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      You’re the love of my life.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re my partner. My person.”
    </p>
<p>
     Luckily, it still made Agatha smile. “You’re my person too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’m sorry about the Wanda thing,” Rio said with genuine shame. “I guess I can get jealous sometimes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sometimes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you’re just as bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “Never said I wasn’t. But seriously, does this Wanda situation bother you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it does, but you said you’d try fix it, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “I told my boss I’ll quit next Monday if he doesn’t get Wanda away from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “I’ll quit right now if you want me to. You just have to ask. Just ask for anything, and I’ll do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     The selfish part of Rio wanted to say yes. Quit that dumb corporate job and come move into her tiny bedroom in her shared apartment. Rio would get ten jobs to look after her, maybe even more. But she knew how hard Agatha had worked to get where she was. The abuse from her mother, the struggles at school, the general saga of being a lesbian in the corporate world. Add failed aspiring author and that was one hell of a journey to success. She couldn’t ask her to throw all that away. She wouldn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t quit for me. We’ll work it out, even if I need to stand beside you like a guard dog.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “You know you can come to my office whenever you like. You can study, because I know this afternoon is eating into your research time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio. You keep saying you’re doing well, but I see no harm in getting even further ahead of schedule.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Rio huffed. “But there is something else…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio levied Agatha with a smirk. “You if I asked you for something, you’d do it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I have something that would make all this up to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha sat up, straight to attention. “Just tell me and I’ll do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not sure you’ll be happy about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Agatha sighed. “I knew you’d ask for this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “And I’ll do it, but we need some preparation first. No just diving in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I suggest we start with me using that new strap a few times then we’ll go to the store and pick out something small and manageable. And you’ll have to be gentle, and patient. The first time won’t be sexy, so we’ll do it a few times until I get used to it. But just because I’m giving you temporary strapping rights doesn’t mean you’re topping me. Even if I’m the one getting fucked, doesn’t mean I’m not the one in charge, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just stared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Agatha prompted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit back a laugh. “That wasn’t what I was going to ask.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stiffened. “It wasn’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But we can definitely discuss…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, lets forget about that completely,” Agatha insisted. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to read some of your writing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay so let’s revisit the strap…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio batted her eyelashes. “But you said I could have anything I wanted?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pouted her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said no.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pleeeeeease?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed in defeat. “Fine but give me a day or so to get something together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and kissed her cheek. “Still want to make rabbit pie?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared over at the cage again. “Perhaps not, but I will get my revenge.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed again. That bunny was totally getting away with all of this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They ended up moving to the bed. Not for sex, but for snuggling. Agatha didn’t feel emotionally ready to have sex yet, and she was sure Rio was the same. So, they lay side my side. Rio was buried in her embrace, her head resting against Agatha’s chest, her arms around her waist.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled as Rio played with ends of her hair. “You really can’t keep still, can you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just love your hair. It’s so long and wild and powerful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, placing a kiss on the top of her head. “You’re such a dork.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted so they were face to face. “And you’re a geek. Guess we’re a perfect match.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess so,” Agatha said softly, Rebecca’s words echoing in her mind.
     <em>
      Tell her, tell her.
     </em>
     “Hey, there’s something I have to tell you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her curiously, and Agatha sucked in a deep breath. She was ready. She was going to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     She was.
    </p>
<p>
     She really was.
    </p>
<p>
     …..
    </p>
<p>
     …..
    </p>
<p>
     …..
    </p>
<p>
     “Rebecca wants me to tell you about Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy?” Rio frowned. “What’s up? Is he okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart warmed at her girlfriend’s instant concern. “He’s fine. It’s just we think it’s right you know about what happened to him, and why, that morning, I left in such a panic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio propped her head up and stared at Agatha attentively.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was his Bar Mitzvah,” Agatha began. “Everyone was having a great time. I was trying, because Wanda had just left me for her husband and I couldn’t stand the pitying looks, but I put a smile on for Billy. Billy…he was different. He was more confident. He played soccer, he had loads of friends. Fundamentally he has always been the same though. Kind, intelligent, obviously gay. Still, I see the Billy before and after as two different people. I guess it just makes it easier.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked confused, but thankfully just let her continue. Agatha couldn’t stop. If she did, she’d never make it to the end.
    </p>
<p>
     “After it was all over, Billy wanted to go in my car. He begged and begged for me to drive him home, but I said no. I told him I needed to get home because I had work in the morning, but really, I’d just had enough. I just wanted to go home. If I could go back…” Agatha stopped herself. That wasn’t a rabbit hole she needed to go down. “So I was driving behind them, heading to the turn off for the highway while they were heading home, when a car cut Rebecca off. She swerved and lost control of the car. They hit a tree side-on. It all happened so fast….”
    </p>
<p>
     The images flashed in front of her eyes, and Agatha tried to blink them away.
    </p>
<p>
     “I pulled up, and I saw Rebecca and Jeff were out of the car. I was so relieved, because they were fine, then Rebecca screamed, and the bottom fell out of my world. The EMT said the crash must have caused Billy to slam his head against the window, but all I saw was blood. I-I didn’t know someone could bleed that much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The scar above his eye,” Rio commented, and Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “When we got to the hospital, the doctor said they would do all they could, but I know that’s just code for ‘he’ll be lucky if he makes it through the night’. He did though, obviously, but he was put in a coma. The doctor said all was well and there was so reason why he wouldn’t make a full recovery. We waited days for him to wake up. I pretty much moved in to Rebecca’s so we could take shifts in case he woke up. Sometimes two of us, sometimes one, sometimes all three. Rebecca and Jeff were there when he did wake up, and they called me to come down. God Rio, I’d never been so happy. He was fine. He was awake. Then I got to the hospital and saw them both loitering in the corridor, and I knew something wasn’t right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “Why? What was wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a shaky breath. “He knew how to talk, knew how to eat and drink. He could even tell us who the president was. He just couldn’t remember any of us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” Rio cursed. “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was hard. Seeing someone you’ve known their entire life look at you like you’re a stranger. Jeff and Rebecca were devastated, to the point they struggled to stay long at the hospital. I stayed though, and I guess that’s what made him latch on to me again. Rebecca always says that it’s just typical I ended up being his favourite again. When he came home, I used to stay whenever I could. He was better when I was there. More settled, less frustrated. When I wasn’t there, he started doing things like flying off the handle and running off. We tried everything, but the combination of his amnesia and his parents being paranoid he was going to get hurt again, he was just a walking powder keg. That’s why I go for dinner so often, even though he’s much better now. That morning was ironically his last bad turn. Partly, I think it was my fault. He wanted to talk to me, and I cancelled on him the night before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You cancelled for me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “He wanted to tell me about Eddie and once all that was out in the open, things have settled besides the usual teenage hijinks. His memory is still a mess, but a month or so ago he remembered I took him to the zoo when he was eight and I broke my heel near the monkey enclosure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You wore heels to the zoo?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really? That’s what you’re taking from all that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “No, I’m sorry. Fuck, Agatha, I’m so sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So am I. I keep thinking if I hadn’t been so hung up on fucking Wanda, I’d have driven him home. Even if the car crashed, Rebecca and Jeff would be fine. If I hadn’t been so selfish…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no. You’re not the blame. That guy who cut Rebecca off is to blame. Did he at least go to jail?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He got six years, but he’ll be out next year if he behaves.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s all?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “After all he did to Billy, to Rebecca and Jeff. All that pain and suffering it caused them. I’d throw him in a hole and let him rot for all he did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And for all the pain it caused you too,” Rio insisted. “I can’t imagine…I mean having to see…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “It was the worst day of my life, well one of them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Rio frowned. “What are the other ones?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, there are the days my dad and grandma died.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s understandable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then Billy’s accident.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And the day my mom found out I was gay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking bitch,” Rio grumbled. “Okay, those a some pretty shitty days.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered her next actions, before deciding she had nothing to lose. “There’s still one more.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “The day I came back, and you weren’t here. The day I almost lost you forever.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes went comically wide, but Agatha pushed on. She had to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you, Rio Vidal. And I know it may be sudden for you. It’s sudden for me, but also not really. Honestly, I think…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha started at her in awe. “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, before attacking her with kisses. “I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you...”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha giggled, but didn’t fight the kisses. How could she? They were from the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio snuggled into her once more. “I’m glad you told me. About Billy, and about loving me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad too.” Agatha placed a kiss to her head. “Now there’s nothing between us. No more secrets.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Rio mumbled into her chest. “No more secrets.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio hated lying, but sometimes it was for the best.
    </p>
<p>
     Sometimes the truth was just too horrible.

<p>
     Agatha watched as Rio played with their necklaces, bringing the two halves together to create the golden heart. They were in bed, the sun beginning to stream through the bedroom window. They would have to get up soon, Agatha for work and Rio to go to the college lab, but for now they were content. Side by side, as Agatha hoped they would spend every night for the rest of their lives.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s your old necklace?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, the old one with the three women on it. You showed me it when we met. You said it was your grandmothers.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “You remembered all that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Was locked in from day one, sweetheart,” Rio teased. “But you stopped wearing it. How come?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I broke the chain. I keep forgetting to get it fixed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached into her bedside table and pulled it out. She handed it to Rio, who sat up, crossing her legs as she inspected the damage.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I try fix it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, but I tried, and Jeff tried. It’s old. They don’t make them like that anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed it in a fist. “Challenge accepted.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and shook her head. She loved that woman so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on.” She swung her legs over the edge of the bed. “We need to get on with the day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, it’s like seven o’clock,” Rio grumbled. “It’s bad enough I’ve ended up with your ridiculous sleep schedule already. I refuse to actually get out of bed at this time. It’s unnecessary.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Agatha feigned a sigh as she stood from the bed, shivering as the cool air hit her cool skin. “Guess I’ll have to have that shower all by myself…”
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she reached the bathroom door, Rio was pressed against her back, pressing kisses to her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     After a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     long shower and a quick breakfast, Agatha dropped Rio off at the college before heading into work. By the time she was walking to the elevator, she had a text from Rio.

    </p>
<p>
     The doors to the elevator began to slide closed, until a hand reached out and stopped them. Agatha glanced up from her phone, and her happy mood quickly disappeared. She watched the woman step cautiously inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda moved to stand by her side, and Agatha instinctively stepped away, creating as much distance as she could without climbing up the walls.
    </p>
<p>
     They stood in silence for a moment, watching as the numbers slowly ascended on the digital display. Of course it was Wanda who felt the need to speak up.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see you’ve recovered from your tantrum.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I see you’re still a fucking bitch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed. “And you’re still as fiery as ever. So, did you get to the bottom of why we were both lied to?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Personal emergency. I left the meeting and said I was fine with anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Personal emergency? The Agatha I knew would have told them to leave a message.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t know me,” Agatha snapped. “Not really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I lived with you. Of course I know you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t even grace that with a response.
    </p>
<p>
     “I heard you got a rabbit…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to talk to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you’re still mad about Vision, but he’s gone. For real this time. I made a mistake, and I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t care,” Agatha dismissed. “I stopped caring about you a long time ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true. You can’t stand to even look at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because your face pisses me off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence fell again, and Agatha hoped it would stay that way. Of course it didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a rumour going round that you have a girlfriend. How long have you been with this one?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Its complicated,” Agatha answered, “and none of your business.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sighed. “Don’t be like this, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator stopped and the doors opened to Agatha’s floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not like anything,” she said as she stepped out of the door. “I’m nothing to you, you’re nothing to me. Let’s leave it that way.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t wait for the doors to close before turning her back on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Quickly retreating to her office, she shut herself inside and slumped in the chair behind her desk. She hated Wanda, hated her stupid face. It wasn’t like when she ‘hated’ Rio either. She genuinely wished to never see her again, but now she was here in her domain. Her equal, if not her superior.
    </p>
<p>
     At least Rio knew, and they were being honest. All cards on the table. It was the most open she had been with any partner, and she was sure Rio felt the same.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone beeped and she looked to see it was a text from her sister.

      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Noted we’ll see you then!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mood had now improved. No matter what Wanda could say or do, she could never change the fact that she had a girlfriend that she loved and her family adored. Nothing could change that, now. Nothing at all.
    </p>
<p>
     That reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened the bottom door of her desk, rummaging through the files before she found what she needed. With a triumphant smile, she set it at the top of the pile and slid the draw shut. That would come in handy later.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a soft knock at the door and Sharon shuffled in with a baking tin. “I made you cookies!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned, accepting the tin from her. “You’re the best assistant I’ve ever had.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I take it the bar was low,” Sharon joked as she sat in the chair opposite her. “I thought you’d need a pick me up after yesterday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back, remembering their interaction. “I’m sorry, Sharon. I didn’t mean to be a shitty boss again, it’s just…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t need to apologise,” Sharon insisted. “You were stressed. I get it. I just wanted to make sure you were okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. It was nice having someone looking after her. It was something she had missed out on- motherly care. It made her feel warm but was chased by a sadness that it was something she’d never truly have in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Agatha assured. “Exes, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded. “It’s better to concentrate on the now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “You’ve changed your tune.”
    </p>
<p>
     A light blush appeared on Sharon’s cheeks. “Saturday night changed my perspective on some things. You were right, it did make me feel better. Better than better, in fact.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I am always right,” Agatha reminded her. “We should do it again sometime. You and Lilia certainly seemed to hit it off.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon grinned and nodded, before standing up. “I best get on, but you know if you need to talk, I’m here. Not just as your assistant, but as your…friend?”
    </p>
<p>
     A few weeks ago, Agatha would have just waved her off dismissively. Yet she couldn’t deny the burst of emotion in her chest. It seemed Rio was making her soft. “Thank you, Sharon. I appreciate that.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched her assistant go with a fond smile, before cracking open the baking tin. As she munched on a cookie, Agatha checked her phone. She really couldn’t wait for Rio to get there. Pathetic? Maybe. Did she care? Not one bit.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stood in line at the coffee shop, sending Agatha a quick text.
    </p>

     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Anything for you, my love.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at her phone. She fucking loved that woman more than anything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coffee-run for the girlfriend?” a voice asked behind her, and Rio turned to see a redhead stood behind her. It took a moment for Rio to realise who she was, but soon realisation dawned on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you’re the girl from the elevator, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     The woman nodded. “Another cute hoodie too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. She was wearing Agatha’s old Northwestern hoodie. “Another stolen one,” she corrected, and the woman laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I remember stealing my husband’s hoodies, well ex-husband now. He has an Oxford one I am most definitely getting in the divorce.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’ve stolen all my girl’s hoodies,” Rio admitted. “She doesn’t mind. She loves me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Next please,” the barista called out, and Rio realised it was her turn to order.
    </p>
<p>
     “See you round?”
    </p>
<p>
     The woman smiled. “I’m sure we’ll bump into each other again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ordered her drinks and headed off towards Agatha’s building. She knew Agatha was waiting for her, but she wasn’t expecting to find her stood in the lobby.  The moment, their eyes met, Agatha strode towards her, a big grin on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     They shared a quick kiss, before Rio held out one of the cups. “Your coffee, m’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took it and placed a thankful kiss on her cheek. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad to be here,” Rio admitted. “Come on, lets head up. I want to be able to kiss you properly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     want me to get that HR complaint, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Perhaps…”
    </p>
<p>
     Laughing away, they waited for the elevator and walked in arm in arm. Rio loved that Agatha didn’t care. She didn’t hide her away. In fact, she seemed more than happy to flaunt her for all to see. It made her feel on top of the world.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as the doors opened, they stepped into the elevator, Agatha pressing the button for her office floor. Sometimes Rio forgot Agatha wasn’t just Agatha. She was corporate publishing badass Agatha Harkness, and it made her want to pin her up against the wall and kiss her silly.
    </p>
<p>
     But she couldn’t, because before the doors shut, two guys got in.
    </p>
<p>
     They looked at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     They froze.
    </p>
<p>
     She froze.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     The basketball guys.
    </p>
<p>
     One of them started to smirk, but the other quickly elbowed him. Both their eyes locked onto Agatha, who stood beside Rio with a confused frown.
    </p>
<p>
     The guys quickly turned their backs to them and Rio took a sip of her drink, avoiding Agatha’s questioning gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel her girlfriend eyes burning into her, but Rio kept her eyes on the digital display. Up, up, up, but not fast enough.
    </p>
<p>
     When she dared look to Agatha, she found her attention had moved on to the two men, her jaw tight and her brow fixed in a stern glare. Agatha wasn’t stupid. She had worked it out all by herself, and she was looking at the guys like she wanted to commit first degree homicide.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had to admit it was pretty hot.
    </p>
<p>
     Thankfully, the soon arrived at Agatha’s floor. Rio went to leave the elevator, but Agatha stopped, standing  before both men. To their credit, they looked absolutely terrified. It seemed Agatha’s reputation proceeded her.
    </p>
<p>
     She took grasped one of their ID badges and studied it. “Richard.” She reached for the other one. “Charlie. Nice to put names to the faces. Have a pleasant afternoon, gentlemen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped out of the elevator, heading towards her office with her head held high, leaving the worried men behind, their cockiness from the week before completely crushed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared at them, swiping her fingers across her throat before chasing after Agatha. She made sure no one was in earshot before whispering into her girlfriend’s ear. “Later, you can do whatever you want to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “I’ll hold you to that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio counted on it.
    </p>
<p>
     They passed Sharon, Rio saying a quick hi as she passed, before following Agatha into her office. The moment the door was shut, Rio found herself pressed against it, Agatha kissing her deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so sexy when you’re scary,” Rio told her between kisses. “You have no idea how much I want you right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked against her lips. “You know what I find so sexy about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ground her hips. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped away from her. “When you type up your lab results.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned and slumped against the door. “Agatha, please!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.” Agatha went and sat at her desk. “I have work to do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that the reward you promised me? Because I’d very much like you to fuck me on your desk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “No, your reward is an actual something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “An orgasm is an actual something, and you give the best ones.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’ll like this more than an orgasm.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Doubt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just get on with your work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saluted her. “Yes ma’am.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dork.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio settled on Agatha’s couch and got to work. Her first job was to copy up her messy table of evidence into something worthy of submitting in a scientific journal, which was easier than it sounded once you’d done it a few times. Rio had done it plenty and was in the middle of formatting her table when Agatha spoke up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay for dinner at my sister’s tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sweetheart, my diary is booked up every night with you, you, you,” Rio pointed out. “Would you be offended if I stayed at my place afterwards though. Lilia said she has a date, and I’d like to make sure she gets home okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A date?” Agatha smirked. “Who’s the lucky person?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know yet,” Rio admitted, though it had driven her crazy since Lilia told her that morning. “A week ago, I’d have complained she was getting more than me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now?” Agatha asked, and Rio looked over her with a huge grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could never complain with a lover like you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You complained not long ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you were teasing,” Rio reminded her. “But I know you’ll make it up to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I will,” Agatha assured. “Now, I want to see evidence when you’ve finished with all that. This reward is a special one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes ma’am,” Rio said again, before getting right to work.
    </p>
<p>
     Not long after, Agatha’s phone rang, and she quickly answered it. “Hello…oh Michael, hi…okay. I’ll have a look…” Rio watched Agatha tap away at her laptop. “Yes, that’s them…I appreciate that, Michael. I look forward to seeing you at our gala. All the best to your lovely wife and kids. Goodbye now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put down the phone and caught Rio’s eye. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Michael?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A colleague of sorts,” she answered vaguely. “Why, you jealous?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but laugh. “Please, you’re dykeatron300.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A lesbian. Big Lez. Lickalottapus. I’d even go as far as saying you’re a soft masc.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t understand any of what you’re saying.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re really fucking dykey, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And don’t you forget it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head and got back to work.
    </p>
<p>
     It took most of the afternoon to get it all done, from displaying her evidence to evaluating her findings, to adding it to the bulk of the thesis. She’d eaten three of Sharon’s cookies, which were of course amazing, and she and Agatha had gone for a walk to their coffee shop to get a top up on their twin orders.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she had it all finished, she approached Agatha’s desk like a student approaching their teacher, eager for praise. At some point in the afternoon, Agatha had put those damn glasses on, and Rio wanted her to drop to her knees and eat her out right then and there. Instead, she offered her laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     “All done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a suspicious look, before taking the laptop from her. Rio waited patiently while her girlfriend read it over, frowning and correcting grammatical errors here and there. When she was done, she handed the laptop back to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Rio asked hopefully.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leant back in her chair and took for her glasses. “Honestly?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s shoulders slumped. “What’s wrong with it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and shook her head. “I’m starting to realise I’m really not the smart one in this relationship.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her, processing her girlfriend’s words, before grinning like an idiot. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, a proud smile on her lips. “Not long now, and I’ll be calling you Doctor Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rubbed her hands together. “So, my prize?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you’ve certainly earned it.” Agatha admitted, pulling open one of her desk draws. “And it’s certainly a prize worth earning.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s mind raced, from sinful sex toys to courtside Lakers tickets. What Agatha pulled out instead was a ring-bound manuscript. She looked at it with a frown. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at the cover.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked it up and read the title.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      The Witches’ Road
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      By
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha Harkness
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “No fucking way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re only borrowing it,” Agatha told her. “I want it back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t care. She held the manuscript in her hands like she was holding the crown jewels. No, this was more precious. This was Agatha’s writing, a novel even. Based around her stepmother’s most famous song, no less.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is the best reward I could ever get.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Dork.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     When the clock struck five, Agatha announced it was time to go. She suggested they go to the store to pick up some things for dinner, then swing by Rio’s place to pick up some clothes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll clean out a draw for you. It makes sense, since we stay at my place more than yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was on cloud nine. She knew in the cosmic balance, she didn’t deserve any of this, but it seems she had been granted this gift somehow. The gift of Agatha, and as they waited for the elevator side by side, she wasn’t going to question her worthiness. She just welcomed in with open arms.
    </p>
<p>
     When the elevator doors opened, the basketball guys were stood there, their sad expressions matching the sad cardboard boxes in their hands. Rio took Agatha’s hand and led her in.  She loved that evil sexy woman with everything she had.

<p>
     “Have you ever thought of buying a house in the suburbs?” Rio asked as they drove through the quiet streets towards the Kaplan’s home. “You know, be closer to your family.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It would be impractical,” Agatha answered. “I work too late, and I wouldn’t like the commute. Maybe if I retired, or if…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked to her girlfriend with a frown. “If what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, if I had a kid. I don’t think raising one in the city would be a good idea. You know, a lot of dangerous stuff going on, and I think it would be nice to give them that picket fence experience.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like a garden I think,” Rio admitted. “I can have window boxes I guess, but it’s not the same. Sure, I’ll probably be getting my hands dirty wherever I can get a job in botany, but who knows where I’ll end up, and I’d sometimes I’d like to tend to plants that don’t come with a danger warning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What would be your dream job at the end of this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My dream would be to run a poison garden. You know, one that’s both cool and educational.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like that one in Scotland?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but closer to home. I don’t think I’m built for rural England, or rural anywhere really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought you were into nature?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am, but nature can be just as dangerous as the city.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched realisation cross over Agatha’s face. “Fuck, I’m sorry. I didn’t forget, I just didn’t think.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Rio insisted. “I just want an environment I can control, you know, to protect the potential little Vidals.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at that. “I bet they’ll be adorable. With cute little tooth gaps.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You think my tooth gap is cute?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it. Its one of my favourite things about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed her tongue against the gap. Suddenly she loved it too.
    </p>
<p>
     They pulled up in the Kaplan’s driveway, and Billy was rushing out of the house before Agatha had even turned off the engine.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled at his eagerness. “I think your nephew missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not just me,” Agatha replied. “Apparently the boys adore you. I think Rebecca likes you too, but she likes to play the protective sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like you didn’t scare off most of her boyfriends.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah cackled. “Most? I think Jeff is still a little scared of me, and he’s the only one that got my blessing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t believe any of that. Well, maybe that last part. She suspected, no, knew Agatha loved her brother-in-law. She was just too damn stubborn to admit it.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they were out of the car, Billy engulfed them in hugs, before taking both of their hands and dragging them towards the house. “I need to show you both something!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It better be PG-13, kid,” Agatha warned him.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is, just come on!”
    </p>
<p>
     They followed him upstairs, neglecting to say hello to the other two Kaplans as Billy led them to his room. They sat by side on the edge of his bed, watching him rummage through his school bag.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was in class today and someone passed me this.” He held it out to them and Agatha was quick to take it, holding it close to her face. “I can’t read a word of this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are your glasses?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “In the car.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You need glasses?” Billy asked. “Since when?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s all that reading,” Rio commented. “Strains the eye. Illiteracy is the cure to perfect eyesight!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up and read this for me,” Agatha huffed, and Rio was happy to comply.
    </p>
<p>
     “It says
     <em>
      do you still like Eddie?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hissed in disgust, before looking to Billy. “You better have said no.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He said
     <em>
      it’s complicated
     </em>
     ,” Rio answered for him. “Which I guess it is.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s complicated about him being an asshole to my nephew?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Need I remind you that we hated each other for a whole year?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t argue with that. “Did the other person reply?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio squinted at the messy handwriting before grinning. “Holy shit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It says
     <em>
      you’re too good for him anyway. Want to hang out on Saturday?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped. “What did Billy say to that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned the paper over and shrugged. “Nothing here.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both looked to the teen, who was now sat opposite them on his desk chair, a look of uncertainty on his face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Agatha prompted. “What did you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t,” Billy admitted. “I just stuffed it in my bag.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Rio gasped. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I don’t even know who it was. As far as I know, there are no gay guys in that class, so it’s either a joke or a girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or someone who hasn’t come out yet who wants to get to know you,” Rio pointed out. “You’re open and proud and that’s great, but not everyone is. Especially in high school.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Were you two?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My coming out was very open,” Agatha joked bitterly. Rio didn’t like that she’d made light of what happened, but decided now was not the time to voice that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I never even came out. I just started kissing girls and everyone was fine with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Billy looked at her in amazement. “Why didn’t I do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you don’t have this one’s ridiculous amount of confidence,” Agatha joked, before turning back to the matter at hand. “So you have no idea who sent it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Billy insisted. “I mean I have it down to three possibilities.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…” Agatha sounded as cautious as Rio felt.
    </p>
<p>
     “First is this girl who doesn’t get the hint that I’m gay. She asked me to the spring formal last year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Solid contender,” Rio agreed. “What about the others?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s Jack. He sometimes says things to me, you know, dumb jock things…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt Agatha tense.
    </p>
<p>
     “But his handwriting is illegible. Which leaves one more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who?” Rio pressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy pulled out his phone. “His name is Teddy. He’s been in my classes since middle school.”
    </p>
<p>
     He showed them the screen, revealing an Instagram selfie of a blonde, broad-shouldered teen wearing a football jersey. Rio had to admit he was a handsome young man. “Why don’t you ask him?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Billy quickly clutched the phone to his chest. “He’s really popular, and I mean he’s nice, but I don’t think all his friends are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’re friends with him?” Agatha questioned and Rio couldn’t help but smirk. Her tough, corporate girlfriend invested in high school drama. She loved this softer side of Agatha that came out when it came to Billy, and now her too. When all the walls and anger slipped away, and she was just Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Though Rio loved any version of her. Every single one.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess,” Billy answered. “We sit next to each other in home room, and we talk but never about Eddie. Just about our interests and stuff. He’s pretty cool.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And he thinks you’re pretty cool too,” Rio teased. “Send him a message.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, don’t,” Agatha countered. “Talk to him face to face.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at you all emotionally mature,” Rio teased, and Agatha shot her a playful glare.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy sighed. “I think I’m over Eddie now. He won’t even look at me still, and I’m not wasting my time waiting for that to change. I think what I miss most is the feeling of being loved, you know? Like when I see how in love you two are...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy, it’s taken us a year to get to this point,” Agatha reminded him. “And our relationship isn’t perfect. Far from it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We just try our best,” Rio added. “And we love each other. That’s all we can do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha took Rio’s hand in hers. “And if I hadn’t approached a very angry looking lady in need of a bathroom key, we wouldn’t be here now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we’d be friends-in-law,” Rio corrected, “and I’d be totally smitten.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’d have ended up together anyway,” Billy mused. “Like Jen and Alice would introduce you, and that would be that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Rio considered. “But we’d have the guilt of not wanting to ruin Alice and Jen’s relationship with our mutual attraction.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Speak for yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rebecca’s voice called up the stairs. “Are you up there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, we’re just talking to Billy,” she called back. “Gay business. We’ll be down when we’re done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca came up anyway, entering the room with clear suspicion. “What’s going on?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I needed advice,” Billy said. “Nothing bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca’s eyes moved to Agatha, before locking with Rio’s. “Do I need to worry?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” she assured. “Just high school gossip.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca stared her down for a moment before nodding. “Right well wrap it up. Dinner will be ready soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re done.” Billy got to his feet. “Can I set up Mario Kart?”
    </p>
<p>
     “After dinner,” Rebecca told him. “If we have time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Dinner was pizza, Billy’s request, and was a more casual than Rio’s previous meals with the Kaplans. Like it was just a normal dinner. Like she was one of the family. Somehow ‘just pizza’ was one of the best meals she’d ever had.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we need to go on a family day out,” Rebecca suggested. “Somewhere nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!” Billy grinned. “Somewhere cool.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put a hand on Rio’s arm. “Rio took me to the botanical gardens. It was amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at her, covering her hand with her own. “They’re probably thinking more like a theme park or...”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, that sounds like a good idea,” Rebecca insisted. “It’ll be nice. The five of us, and maybe Alice and Jen? Seeing that we’re all going to be family at some point.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen’s away,” Agatha supplied as she tucked into another piece of pizza. “Maybe best that she’s not there though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like Jen,” Billy commented. “When are you two going to have kids?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s initial shock was quickly replaced by panic when Agatha started chocking on her pizza. She patted her girlfriend on the back as she coughed, then rubbed it while she caught her breath and handed her some water.
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy,” his mother scolded. “That was inappropriate?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” he questioned. “I was just asking?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t ask that kind of thing,” Jeff told him. “Besides, they’ve only been dating…what, like a month?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. Technically, it was their weekiversary, but who knows when it actually became real. Perhaps it always had been. She wasn’t going to question it. She was too happy with the present to even think about the past. And for her, that was really something.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to have recovered, using a napkin to wipe her lips. “Kid, if Rio and I have kids, it needs a lot of planning and discussion.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio agreed, “like if we want to adopt, or try fertility treatment, and figuring out where we’ll live, how it’ll go with work…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d go part time,” Agatha answered. “And we’d see where your job lands you. Hopefully somewhere with good schools and a safe neighbourhood.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nowhere near any dangerous plant life,” Rio added. “But with enough green space for them to appreciate nature.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And a good public library and local bookstores,” Agatha added. “And a safe playground.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And a house with a decent yard.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And enough space for both a playroom and an office. Two if we both need one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or we can share?” Rio suggested with a grin. “Work side by side.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think that might be too distracting,” Agatha replied. “Though all work and no play…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca cleared her throat. “We’re all still here, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swore she saw Agatha blush and tucked that mental image away for later. For that night, when she would be in her own bed, sleeping alone for the first time in days.
    </p>
<p>
     Damn Lilia and her stupid love life.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway, we don’t even live together yet,” Agatha reminded her nephew. “One thing at a time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I do have a draw now,” Rio declared proudly, making Rebecca laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha gave up wardrobe room? Thought I’d never see the day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, that reminds me. Rebecca, can I leave some clothes in the spare room? Just until we can get a place with a bit more storage.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows at that, to which Agatha shrugged. “When we do eventually move in together, we’d need enough room for us and Senõr Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And Webbers.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine, and the tarantula too”.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned back at her. She was most definitely ready to U-Haul.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha escaped the first round of Mario Kart, as had her brother-in-law who insisted he had to catch up on work (they all knew he was watching sports), so Rio had been Billy’s first victim.
    </p>
<p>
     As she helped Rebecca, drying the dishes as she washed, she couldn’t help but smile at the shouts and laughter coming from the next room. A part of her wished she could watch the chaos, but she knew the moment one of them spotted her, she’d end up getting involved.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hated Mario Kart. Unless she was winning, of course.
    </p>
<p>
     “They get on well,” Rebecca commented. “Rio and Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They do.” Agatha would never deny that. It was one of the many, many things that she loved about Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s good for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “She’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca was quiet, and Agatha thought the conversation was over. Her mind drifted back to the living room, to her nephew and her girlfriend. She hated that she was dropping Rio home instead of them both returning to her apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     It had nothing to do with sex, even though she did very much enjoy that. She had stupidly gotten used to waking up next to her, to holding her as the first rays of sun crept into her bedroom. To breakfast and standing side by side as they brushed their teeth. To snuggling into the pillows and tangling their legs together as they fell into peaceful slumbers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t dreamed about her mother for nights. Not her insults, punishments, and most thankfully not that dark cupboard. She worried she would be locked in there again that night, without Rio there to bring her out. Perhaps she should have suggested they stay at Rio’s place together. She still could, and swing by her apartment on the way to work to freshen up properly the next morning. Only if Rio asked her though.
    </p>
<p>
     “I still have your ring here, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused her drying to look at her. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your grandmother’s ring,” Rebecca clarified. “You moved it here after your building had that break in.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha remembered. It had caused no end of hysteria amongst her neighbours.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you need me to take it back?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rebecca answered. “Just reminding you in case you need it anytime soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “W-why would I need it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her sister laughed. “You know why.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to respond, to question exactly what Rebecca meant, because surely she didn’t mean…because that would be ridiculous. Even in the timeline of their fake relationship, it was too fast. Moving in would be too fast.
     <em>
      THAT
     </em>
     would be absolutely stupid, and reckless, and…why was she arguing with herself?
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could make that argument to her sister, Billy came barrelling into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you need to take over. Rio is too good at Mario Kart.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s evil laugh echoed through from the living room. “You will never defeat me, Harkness!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tossed the dish towel aside. “Oh, we’ll see about that, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio won. Rio won every single race. Rebecca was in shock, Billy in awe, and Agatha…Agatha was not pleased.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh come on, sweetheart,” Rio said as they drove back to the city. “So you lost? Billy said you’ve lost plenty of times before.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot her a glare before fixing her eyes on the road again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeez,” Rio spoke up again. “I didn’t know you were such a sore loser.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re a sore winner,” Agatha accused. “You laughed in my face.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, you were all fighting talk until I hit you with that banana.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just don’t like losing,” Agatah huffed. “Sorry for not being a perfect person.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re perfect to me,” Rio quickly protested. “Like I’m in awe of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips curled at the edges. “Dork.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure you can’t stay at my place?” Agatha asked. “I’m sure Lilia will be fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure, but maybe next time she goes on a date, we could spend the night at my place? You know, just for a change?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. I don’t like leaving Senõr Scratchy alone all day and then all night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bring him,” Rio insisted. “He needs to meet Webbers anyway. Seeing as they will be stepsiblings at some point.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not being stepmom to a tarantula,” Agatah protested. “You know how I feel about spiders.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Arachnids,” Rio corrected. “And I know, but we come as a package deal. I’m not too keen on fluffy animals, remember? But I love Senõr Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You just don’t like them,” Agatha pointed out. “I hate spiders.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because of your mom?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to talk about it tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Rio accepted. “But I’d like to know some time. I’d like to know everything about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “So I can’t have any secrets?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought you told me them all?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t tell you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because it’s a big secret.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pleeeease.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, please, please, please, please, ple-”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want a baby with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     That managed to shut her up.
    </p>
<p>
     “No right now,” Agatha clarified. “But some day. I want them to look just like you, and for them to love plants just as much as they love reading. And to be totally in awe of Grandma Lorna, and adore their cousin, Billy. That’s my secret.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remained quiet, and Agatha dared to steal a glance her way. Her girlfriend’s eyes were wide, her body tense and mouth agape. Shit, shit, shit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, stopping at a red light. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t we have one right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Luckily her foot was on the brake, otherwise she’d have caused an accident. “We can’t have a baby right now, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?” Rio questioned. “It’s a long process. We might as well start it now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you want a baby?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I really want a baby, especially with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to finish your PhD.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The baby is more important.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The baby will wait,” Agatha told her. “You need to graduate.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so after graduation…”
    </p>
<p>
     “We can revisit the conversation,” Agatah suggested, moving to the gas as the lights turned green. “Discuss our options.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Rio accepted. “You need to accept my first-born son though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll think about it,” Agatha replied, knowing she was never going anywhere near that damn spider.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled up outside Rio’s building, like she had done so many times before. Each time had been harder to say goodbye, but this was the worst.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to miss you,” Agatha admitted. “I’ll call you when I get home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We could sleep on call?” Rio suggested. “Then it’ll be like I’m there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it won’t.” Agatha couldn’t pretend. It wouldn’t be anywhere close to the same.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned over and kissed her softly. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can count on it.” Agatha kissed her one more time and watched sadly as Rio climbed out of the car. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Rio grinned, before she headed off inside. Agatha waited until she had totally disappeared from view before driving away.
    </p>
<p>
     Making her way through the city traffic, she tried to think of other things. She was due some Senõr Scratchy time, and she was in the middle of a good book, and she and Rio were going to speak over the phone. But she wouldn’t be able to touch her, hold her, see her smile in real time.  And she was scared. Scared of sleeping alone. She didn’t want the nightmare. She didn’t want to be back in that cupboard again. She didn’t want to wake up panicked and alone.
    </p>
<p>
     She was a few blocks away when her phone rang. Glancing at her central console, she saw it was Rio. She quickly answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I’m not home yet. Just give me five…”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ,” Rio’s voice escaped the car speakers in nothing more than a whisper.
     <em>
      “Are you still close?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Worry shot through her. “Yes, why?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I need you to get back here now. Please, I need to get out of here.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t hesitate. She did a u-turn, flipping off those who beeped her, before racing back towards Rio’s apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened? Are you safe?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’m fine, but please hurry. I’ll meet you out front.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     By the time Agatha pulled up, Rio was racing out of the building and swiftly jumped into the passenger seat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go, go, go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sped off. “Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do we need to call the police?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Rio insisted. “Traumatised, but fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was awful, Agatha. I walked in, and I thought I was home alone because all the lights were off. Then I saw there were clothes all over the floor, and I thought Lilia had just had a bit of a wardrobe disaster, but there was like this really ugly grandma sweater that I knew Lilia wouldn’t even think of wearing. And then I heard it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Heard what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The moaning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Agatha slammed on the breaks, earning another beep from the car behind. “Rio Vidal, I though you were in danger! I’ve broke a dozen traffic laws to get back to you, and it was all because you heard you roommate have sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t sex,” Rio insisted. “They were fucking. Like dirty fucking.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head and started driving again. “So? Lilia was having a good time. Need a remind you how loud we can be?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s loud, and there’s
     <em>
      loud.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “It can’t have been that bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes, baby you’re doing so good! Just give it to me, baby! Give it to me!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Okay, I get the picture.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t,” Rio insisted. “That was just Lilia. Her date was screaming…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wished to could erase this knowledge from her mind. “Right, well, we’re going to my place now so you can just forget it ever happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will never forget,” Rio responded dramatically. “I’m serious, Agatha. I don’t think I can ever have sex again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Woah, woah, let’s not be too hasty there,” Agatah quickly jumped in. “I’m sure you’ve heard people moaning before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not like that! And not when I live with one of them!”
    </p>
<p>
     “So because you heard Lilia have sex, we’re never going to have sex again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Agatha didn’t know what to say. Her brain was totally frazzled. “We can still cuddle though, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Rio answered. “We’ll see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once at Agatha’s apartment, Rio played with Senõr Scratchy, before she decided she wanted an early night. Agatha let her get ready, pretending she wanted to finish a chapter of her book. Instead, she stood looking out at the city, contemplating the conversations that had transpired that evening. About their future homes, their future children, and the ring. She couldn’t forget about the ring.
    </p>
<p>
     Her grandmother's ring had been in the Harkness family for years, given to her grandmother by her grandfather. She had worn it every day since their engagement to the day she was sent off to the funeral home. Agatha had kept it safe, planning to give it either to her future wife, or to Billy to give to his future partner, until it became very apparent it would not be appropriate for her nephew’s future spouse.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, however, had the perfect hand for such a gem. A green emerald encased on a gold band. It was like it had been made for her. Maybe it had been, all those years go. Perhaps, as it was passed down from Harkness to Harkness, it was always destined to be on the finger of one Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could think more of it, her loves voice cut through the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, I want to cuddle.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled to herself and switched off the light, making her way to her bedroom. Rio was already snuggled in bed, looking at her over the blanket. She made quick work of getting ready, before joining her under it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Better?” Agatha asked as Rio instantly nestled in her embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     “Much.” Rio answered, resting her head on her shoulder. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed a gentle kiss against her crown. “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t have sex. They just slept. Agatha had no nightmares. Instead, she dreamt of emeralds, happy tears, and a breathtaking smile.

<p>
     It was Friday, and Rio was so excited.
    </p>
<p>
     She was meeting Agatha after she finished work and they were going out for a romantic meal. Just them. A proper date.
    </p>
<p>
     Going on a first romantic date after confessions of love and talk of babies was not usually how it worked, but it had worked for them. Still, Rio wanted to have this romance. Wanted to show off their love and share a bottle of champagne between courses and staring lovingly into each other’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had picked the place, but had sent over the details to check it was okay. It was expensive, but not ridiculously so, and the food looked amazing. What Rio loved about it, however, was that her amazing, gorgeous, absolutely perfect girlfriend had found a botanical themed restaurant, complete with indoor shrubs and in-theme cocktails. Pair that with the excellent company and the inevitable late night they’d have when they made it back to Agatha’s apartment, and it was set to be the most perfect evening.
    </p>
<p>
     After a morning of classes and lab work, Rio returned to her apartment with an excited spring in her step. Lilia was at the dining table, doing her daily readings.
    </p>
<p>
     “You seem happy,” she commented. “Of course you are. I haven’t seen you in days.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well you would have if you hadn’t brought your date home on Wednesday.” Rio was still totally grossed out. Luckily her aversion to the act itself had passed by the next morning, when Agatha ‘accidently’ brushed her inner thigh while they were cuddling.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia chuckled. “It seems we’re going to be like ships in the night from now on. Speaking of which I won’t be here tomorrow night. Think you can convince Agatha to stay over? I don’t trust that new guy down the hall.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s a veterinarian.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s a suspicious-looking veterinarian.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, I’ll ask her. She will want to bring Senõr Scratchy though. He’ll stay in my room.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is Mister Scracthy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Senõr,” Rio corrected. “He’s her rabbit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She has a rabbit? Like a bunny rabbit?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, an actual animal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia laughed. “I’d have thought Agatha would be more of a cat lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! One, there’s nothing wrong with cats, and two, I don’t like the insinuation behind that at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, defensive much,” Lilia teased before shuffling her cards. “You know, we only have two months left on our lease.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we had the option to renew?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We do, but I just wanted you to know, I won’t be offended if you want to back out?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “Why would I back out?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you’re in love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved her off. “Agatha and I discussed it, and we’re going to get our own place at some point, but until then we’re having our separate homes. Our own spaces.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia let out a loud laugh. “You don’t even have your own personal space at the moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you see Agatha here? No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because she’s at work,” Lilia reminded her. “Where
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     have been studying all week.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio crossed her arms. “How do you know that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia looked back to her cards. “Lucky guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could question her, her phone dinged in her pocket. She pulled it out, seeing it was Alice.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Need to talk. Can we meet for coffee?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart dropped. No, no, no. Not today. Please, not today.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I need to finish some work then I’m meeting Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was only half a lie.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Please? It’s important. I can meet you at that place near your apartment? Or are you at Agatha’s?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio relaxed a little. She seemed more eager than demanding, but she couldn’t be sure.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay but not for too long.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      ALICE
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Give me 20 minutes!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sighed and stuffed her phone back in her pocket.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m going to meet Alice.” Rio shrugged it off. “She needs to talk to me. Probably about Jen or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well that’s nice, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio forced a smile before rushing off to dump her stuff in her room.
    </p>
<p>
     After a quick check-in with Webbers, she headed off to the Starbucks round the corner. It wasn’t too far, wasn’t too fancy, and was Rio’s second favourite coffee shop. She wondered if she should take Agatha there sometime, but if this what about what she thought it was, the place would be forever cursed in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was already there, sat at a table in the corner with two iced lattes. Rio approached with caution, tensing when their eyes met. Then her sister smiled, and she allowed herself to relax.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t that. It was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” She slid into the seat opposite and took a sip of her drink. “Vanilla. You know me too well.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice chuckled. “I should hope. We did grow up together. So, you’re seeing Agatha later?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio grinned. “We have a dinner date. How’s Jen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s flying home tomorrow. She wants a double date when she’s back. Next week sometime, though. We’ll be, erm, otherwise occupied this weekend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I bet you will be.” Rio couldn’t imagine what she’d be like if Agatha went away on a work trip. She’d need a week in bed to make up for it. Perhaps even more. (Though if Agatha ever went on a work trip, she would just hide in her suitcase and go with her. That way they could have their own lover’s retreat on the company’s dime. HR would definitely hate them for that, but it would be so worth it).
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha makes you happy, doesn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned at the question. “Of course she does. Why are you asking that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m happy you finally met someone, and at the same time as me! Mom always said we always did everything together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, recalling how her stepmother found great joy in the sisterly bond that had formed quickly between them. She didn’t remember much from her time before…when she only spent every other weekend and holidays with them. What she did remember was the excitement to see Alice again, and how sad she always was to say goodbye. After, they weren’t apart for the following twelve years, even longer if you counted going to college on the same campus. Or when they lived two blocks away from each other in equally shitty apartments, or when Rio ended up sleeping on her couch for over a year. Even now, here they were, dating best friends.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was her one constant, and the thought of losing her was too much to bear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Speaking of Mom, I need to talk to you about something.”
    </p>
<p>
     Dread filled her again. Oh God, had she…
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve started writing her memoir, autobiography. Whatever. I’ve just written the first page, about what I knew about her early years. Her journals don’t start until her teens, but she told us both plenty of stories.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, instantly relaxed. Crisis averted. “Like the time her mom got mad at her for spending her birthday money on a Beatles LP.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. You know, the story of the American-born daughter of immigrants that did everything to just get by, and she used her love for music to make up for that sacrifice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always been a bit scared of Lorna’s parents. They treated her the same as Alice, but while Alice fit the good girl mould, Rio had always thought of herself as a bad boy, and would spend a lot of time at the receiving end of Mrs Wu’s disapproving gaze. Sometimes though, she caught a smile, and Rio suspected her step-grandmother secretly found her rebelliousness funny.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom made sure we’d never go without, like her family often had to,” Alice continued. “I miss her, and Dad. I know you do too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. She missed them every day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Especially recently now that I’ve met Jen,” Alice continued. “I wish they could have met.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I wish they could have met Agatha. Though I’m pretty sure her and Billy would just fangirl.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They were in the same room once, though,” Alice reminded her. “When Agatha saw her in concert.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was true. It wasn’t a meeting, per say, but they did breathe the same air for two hours.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wonder what show it was,” Alice mused. “Maybe we were there too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was when she and Rebecca were teenagers, so we must have been.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Find out which one and I’ll check. I still have the archive from Mom’s old tour photographer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The chances of you spotting Agatha in the crowd is next to nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But there’s still a chance.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we still have those photographs you took when Dad bought you that camera.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hid her head in her hands. “Please don’t remind me. I think it was some kind of baby crush on that photographer. I followed her everywhere.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No wonder none of us were surprised when you got a girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you were the surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh please, I was little Miss Biker Jacket and shirts from Hot Topic. Who looked at me and thought heterosexual?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “We thought you were just grunge.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head, taking a sip of her drink, before regarding Rio seriously once more. “Will you read what I’ve written at some point. You know, to make sure it’s not total crap.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, and I’ll get Agatha to look too. She’s got an eye for the written word.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Great and maybe you could help when we get to her meeting Dad. You know as much as that as me. Maybe more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re her daughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So are you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are in the way that counts.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but it’s not the same,” Rio told her. “Just…remember what I said…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I know. Leave your mom out of it. I’ve not even read that far yet, anyway. Dad and Mom have only just met. They were so smitten. I had to skim over the sex stuff, though. It’s so gross.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her head in her hands. Twice in one week. She’d been traumatised twice in one week.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed to herself as she worked. She couldn’t wait for that night. She couldn’t wait to see Rio. That was what her life had become now: wishing away the hours until she saw her incredible girlfriend. Partner. Fianc-no, no, no. She wasn’t thinking about that again. Though her mind seemed to be leading her back there at any given opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a knock on her office door, and Agatha called for them to enter. When she saw it was Mike, she took of her glasses and smiled stiffly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you here to tell me I need to write my resignation?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda still wants you,” Mike told her. “But I’ve buffered her with interns for now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you. Is that all, or…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you bringing your partner to the gala?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “I am, and if that’s a problem…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s no problem,” Mike quickly insisted. “We need two more people on your table, is all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My table?”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a knicks game on and some of our partners have tickets. It means we can invite a better mix of people though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Sharon can have one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She already has two spots at your table.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows. Was Sharon bringing one of her kids or did she have a date?
    </p>
<p>
     “So do you think you can fill the spaces?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can fill them,” Agatha assured. “I’ll confirm and send it over.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent. Thank you, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     She offered him another tight smile which she dropped the moment he was out of the door. Since the whole Wanda mess, she decided she hated everyone (except Sharon, of course).
    </p>
<p>
     Her laptop chimed and she popped her glasses back on to read the incoming email.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Hi Agatha,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      How are you?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      W
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha glowered at her screen as she typed back.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha Harkness
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Leave me alone.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The reply came quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Do you really want me to?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Agatha Harkness
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Yes.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I stopped by your office last night after you left. Your girlfriend is very pretty.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha clenched her teeth together. She deleted the emails and slammed her laptop shut. She looked at the photos on her desk. The new ones, of Rio and Billy, and herself but those two took up all of her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     She was tempted to still write her resignation. To give up her apartment and go more in with Rebecca. To write and try make something for herself away from all this mess, until she and Rio could find a place of their own.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet she needed the money, she needed the stability. She’d gotten all this all by herself, and she needed a better reason to throw all it away than an annoying ex. So she continued with her work, and watched the clock tick by.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon enough, it was five, and Agatha told Sharon to head on home.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are your plans tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m seeing a friend,” Sharon answered as she gathered her things. “What about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “About to get ready for date night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh that’s so darn lovely,” Sharon grinned. “You two are so good together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Agatha grinned. “Now you go start your weekend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once Sharon was gone, Agatha changed into her date outfit. It was nothing special, a pantsuit she had gotten for some kind of corporate event, but she knew Rio loved her in a suit. After sprucing up her make up and wafting herself with the perfume that she also knew made Rio go crazy, she headed out.
    </p>
<p>
     As she waited for the elevator, she got a message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Downstairs, my love
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled as she stepped forward into the opening elevator doors.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      See you soon, my love
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Alone in the elevator, her mind wandered back to that old wedding ring chestnut again. She could imagine it easily on Rio’s hand. She could see it glistening on Rio’s finger when she pushed her hair out of her face, could see it against their pillows at sunrise, could see it in every photo and precious moment they’d share thereafter.
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps it wasn’t too early. Maybe when you meet the right person, time doesn’t matter. She knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Rio. That was what mattered.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped out of the elevator, adrenaline coursing through her. She spotted Rio instantly, like always, but she also saw she wasn’t alone.
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha saw red.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio waited for Agatha, excited but also nervous. She’d put on her best little black dress and done her makeup dark and sharp, but she worried it wasn’t enough. It was stupid, really. She knew Agatha loved her, but she wanted to take her breath away. She wanted that night to be perfect, down to even the smallest details.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” a familiar voice called out, “you look a million dollars.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked and saw the redheaded woman from the elevator approaching her. She greeted her with a smile. “Thanks. I’m meeting my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s certainly going to be pleased to see you.” The redhead looked her up and down. “She’s one lucky lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m the lucky one,” Rio insisted. “She’s the best. Oh, and here she is now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled when she saw Agatha approaching, only to frown when she was the thunderous expression on her girlfriend’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what’s…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood between her and the redhead. “Back off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what the hell?” Rio questioned. “We’re just talking…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Agatha,” the redhead said with a smirk. “No harm done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. What was going on?
    </p>
<p>
     “You.” Agatha jabbed a finger in the redheads face. “Be quiet.” She the whirled round to face Rio. “Do you know who she is?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well kind of. We’ve met a few times,” Rio asked, looking between them. Why the hell was Agatha acting like this? And why didn’t she like this wom…
    </p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared at the woman. “You’re Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re my ex’s new squeeze. Rio, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know her name?” Agatha demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Office gossip. You never got someone fired for me, Agatha. I’m offended.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t talk to her.” Rio stepped up next to Agatha. “How long did you know who was?”
    </p>
<p>
     “As soon as I saw you,” Wanda admitted. “I’d recognise Agatha’s ugly hoodies anywhere. Though she never let me wear one. You really are special.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just leave us alone, Wanda,” Agatha snapped. “We don’t want anything to do with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked Rio up and down. “She is pretty, Agatha. I’ll give you that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?” Agatha demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just an observation,” Wanda answered. “Seems to me like you’re having a mid-life crisis with some charity case.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha surged forward, and Rio was only just quick enough to pull her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, don’t. She’s not worth it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged Rio off, before storming out of the building, interns jumping out of her path before she shoved the doors open and disappeared into the night.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to Wanda. “Happy now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really,” Wanda admitted. “The love of my life is running around with a college student. Kind of takes the joy out of things.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped closer. “You listen to me. She isn’t yours. She’s nothing to you now. We’re happy. We’re making plans. You don’t have a place in that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda raised her eyebrows. “Oh, don’t I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio answered swiftly. “Now if you’ll excuse me.”
    </p>
<p>
     With one last glower, she rushed out of the building to catch up with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Their perfect night was ruined.

<p>
     “Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Rio’s voice behind her, but she didn’t stop. She charged down the street with her head held high, her jaw set tight as her long coat fanned out behind her. She hated Wanda. She hated her before, but she really hated her now. Playing games with her was one thing, but playing games with Rio? THAT was crossing the line.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Rio reached her, gripping her arm as she caught her breath. “Agatha, stop for a moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha please!”
    </p>
<p>
     That got her to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     “She had no right to talk to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She has no right to talk to you either,” Rio replied. “I can’t believe I was so stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not stupid. I should have shown you a photograph or described her. I knew she could be a little unhinged at times, but this? Tricking you? It’s beyond...”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s crazy stalker shit and it needs to stop. Can’t you report her for harassment or...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing will happen. She’s too important to the company. Before I could deal with it but this, the emails...”
    </p>
<p>
     “What emails?” Rio frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “She emailed me today, told me she’d been in my office and seen a picture of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, this can’t continue.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Agatha ran a stressed hand through her hair. “I’ve had enough of it all, but I can’t leave. I can’t just abandon all my hard work because my ex is a crazy fucking…”
    </p>
<p>
     Her anger got the best of her, and she kicked a nearby trash can.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay.” Rio took her hand. “Look, it doesn’t matter. I’m fine, okay? A little creeped out but I’ll be fine. No need to beat up an innocent trash can.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked away with shame, but Rio quickly cupped her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, look at me. Whatever happens from now on, we’re a team. Us against the world and that includes your crazy ex.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just hate that this is affecting you now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was always affecting me,” Rio admitted. “She’s trying to steal my girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She never will,” Agatha swore. “Still, I hate being the one bringing baggage into this relationship. First my mom, now Wanda…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, I have loads of baggage,” Rio insisted. “They just all happen to be dead.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Morbid,” Agatha responded and Rio laughed softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You bring the drama, I bring the macabre.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Complete with a tarantula.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And a scheming bunny.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled. She still hadn’t totally forgiven Senõr Scratchy, but it was hard to be mad at someone so adorable.
    </p>
<p>
     “So shall we go have the most perfect evening ever?” Rio suggested. “Seeing as you look so handsome.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward and kissed her cheek. “Who am I to say no to the most beautiful person in the entire world?”
    </p>
<p>
     She got them a cab and gave the driver the address. It wasn’t far, a ten minute drive in city traffic, but as Rio talked about her morning at college and she about work, the time flew by. Soon enough, they were at the restaurant. Agatha paid the driver before jumping out and running round the car to open Rio’s door for her.
    </p>
<p>
     She held out her hand. “Allow me, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and took it, allowing Agatha to help her out of the cab and shut the door behind her. Still holding her hand, she led her gorgeous girlfriend into the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff wasn’t ruining this for them. Agatha refused to let that happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Once at their table, Agatha watched Rio explore the cocktail menu with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Lavender Lemonade looks nice. Oh, and the Elderflower Sparkler! The Bee’s Knees looks up your street, sweetheart.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slipped on her glasses to look properly. “It’s got vodka in it. I don’t want a hangover ruining my Saturday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I forgot it was your kryptonite,” Rio teased, before returning her attention back to the menu. “What about the Floral Sangria?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked it over. “That doesn’t sound half bad. What are you getting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Poison Ivy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her drinks menu. “You look so sexy with those glasses on. Please can you keep them on tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t need them once I’ve ordered,” Agatha pointed out.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean for later.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows, a slow smirk growing on her lips. “I have other plans for us tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really?” Rio leaned forward. “Tell me more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That would spoil the surprise. But maybe we can try with the glasses tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     She expected a teasing reply, but instead she noticed Rio shifted nervously in her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     “So I need to ask you something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is everything okay?” Agatha was quick to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     “Everything is perfect,” Rio insisted. “I just need to stay at my place tomorrow. Lilia is staying with her mystery screamer and wants me to watch the apartment. But you can come too and bring Senõr Scratchy. He needs to meet Webbers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Knowing him he’d tried to eat her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They will meet through their enclosures,” Rio clarified. “I love my baby girl too much for that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced. She didn’t get the appeal of that spider.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do you say?” Rio asked hopefully. “Care to have a sleepover at my place?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to braid my hair?” Agatha teased, pleased to see Rio instantly relax.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe, but you can definitely hold mine back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed her thighs together. She couldn’t wait to get her home.
    </p>
<p>
     They ordered their drinks and then their food, both of them quickly falling into the ambiance of the place. Rio took great pleasure in naming every plant she could see in both English and Latin, which Agatha found both completely adorable and totally hot.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her glasses away, causing Rio to pout, but she quickly moved on to something else.
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw Alice today. Did I tell you she’s writing our mom’s biography?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, when did this happen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She found Lorna’s journals a while ago, but she told me at the weekend she wanted to use them to publish something. She thinks it’ll be a good way to honour her legacy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha agreed. It was also a story many would want to read, including herself. Though her interest was much more personal now. It would have to include Rio, and she was intrigued about that life on the road. Rio didn’t talk about it much, even less so about her other mother. Her birth mother. Perhaps, if Rio allowed it, this story would fill in some of those blanks. Her professional head, however, saw the revenue this book would bring, with a possible screen adaptation and impressive book tour. Though non-fiction wasn’t her area of work, she knew the trade and knew this was going to be a success.
    </p>
<p>
     “She wants me to read some of it,” Rio continued, “but I don’t get all that writing critique stuff, so I was wondering if you could give it a once over? Just to give her some feedback?”
    </p>
<p>
     Ah.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Rio frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “You do know my feedback can be quite...harsh. I’m rather particular about the quality I expect.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can imagine,” Rio teased. “But I think she needs it. Better coming from you than the New York Times.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess that’s true.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I value your opinion, seeing as you’re a writing genius. I’m really enjoying your manuscript.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m still near the beginning, seeing as
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     keeps taking up most of my free time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve barely had time to read either,” Agatha admitted. “Shall we have a reading date tomorrow at your place? Get all snuggled together, nice and cosy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that like your dream evening?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Any evening with you is a dream.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Smooth. Back to my Mom, though. When did you see her in concert? Alice has been bugging me about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back. “It was during the ‘Return to the Road’ tour. They did a show in Cleveland. Why does she want to know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She got a bit emotional about our parents not getting to meet Jen, then got all starry eyed about you being at one of Mom’s concerts. And, you know, me being there at the same time. Like an invisible string thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a disgraced look. “You are so getting educated on the masterpiece of an album that is
     <em>
      Folklore
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, but didn’t argue.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The evening was, indeed, perfect. In fact, Rio had never had such a perfect dinner. The décor, the drinks, the food, but most of all, the company. As she took the last sip of her drink, she watched as Agatha spoke with the waiter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very good,” her girlfriend praised. “We will be back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I get you the dessert menu?” the waiter asked, and Agatha looked to Rio. She contemplated, before shaking her head. Agatha dismissed the waiter, requesting the bill.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is everything alright?” she asked with a frown. “Did you not enjoy it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I loved it,” Rio insisted. “But I want to get home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s frown deepened. “Are you sure…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio stopped her, “I want us to go home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her highly intelligent yet currently clueless girlfriend stared back at her in clear confusion, until finally the penny dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” A wicked smirk appeared on her lips. “Very well, then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had hoped for a cheeky make out session in the cab on the way back, but Agatha noticed the driver was listening to an audiobook, which led to them discussing literature the entire way back. She didn’t mind too much though. Seeing Agatha so engrossed and enthusiastic was quite enthralling.
    </p>
<p>
     Thankfully, Agatha wrapped up the conversation when they reached her building, and quickly paid the guy before dragging Rio out on the cab and towards her building.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eager,” Rio commented once they stopped to wait for the elevator.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned into her ear. “Honey, eager doesn’t even cut it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Yet Agatha didn’t touch her in the elevator, had even let go of her hand and just watched the display screen while biting her lip. Rio watched her curiously. If she didn’t know any better, she’d say she was nervous about something.
    </p>
<p>
     When they made it to the apartment, Agatha started running around like a mad thing. Feeding and giving cuddles to Scratchy, then making them both a drink, then raiding the cupboards. Rio would have laughed at the ridiculousness if it wasn’t so concerning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe,” she piped up, “what’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothings wrong,” Agatha insisted. “Do you want some ice cream?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I want you to tell me why you’re so nervous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “I don’t get nervous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio folded her arms. “Don’t lie to me, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched her love’s shoulders drop as she looked down, avoiding her gaze. “It’s stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I bet it isn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     A pause. “I want to use the strap. Not the usual ones. The one that…”
    </p>
<p>
     “The strapless strap,” Rio finished for her. “Okay, cool. I’m in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, and I’m excited, but I’ve never…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cupped her cheeks. “Do you really want to use it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Agatha admitted. “I really do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then come on.” Rio took her hand and led her through to the bedroom. She stopped them at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and moved a hand up to move stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face, tucking it safely behind her ear. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “And I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, enjoying being in change for once. She placed a hand on Agatha’s waist and pressed a soft kiss against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever reluctance existed in Agatha was gone in an instant, and Rio’s temporary control was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped her face, devouring Rio’s lips with her own. Hungry, desperate, and ready to go.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gripped her shoulders and allowed Agatha to take everything. Everything she had was hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back and Rio watched as she took off her suit and threw it aside, revealing her matching black lace underwear. Her mouth practically watered at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a goddess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If I’m a goddess, you’re an angel,” Agatha replied. “Or a demon. Pure temptation.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and reached for the helm of her dress, quickly pulling it over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes travelled over her and locked her lips. “I knew you weren’t wearing anything under that. Pure temptation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fluttered her eyelashes innocently, only to smirk when Agatha shook her head and stripped the lace from her body.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get on the bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio complied instantly, crawling across the mattress before lying back against the pillows, legs open and welcoming. Agatha was on her in an instant, kissing and sucking every inch of Rio’s chest, before trailing kisses down her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she reached her pubic bone, Rio grasped her hair and pulled. “Not now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “After,” Rio pleaded. “I need it as much as you do.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched as Agatha retrieved the toy, before disappearing into the bathroom to clean it. Rio stared down her own body, smirking at how hard her nipples were against the cool air that also tickled between her legs. She craved a warmth that only Agatha could give her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she returned, Agatha got the bottle of lube from her nightstand before moving to kneel between Rio’s legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands were shaking, the nerves having returned, but Rio wouldn’t allow them to stay. She sat up and took the bottle from her, applying the contents to the shorter curved end of the toy, before bringing it between Agatha’s legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands reached to join hers, and together they guided the toy inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha’s face carefully. Watched her lips pressed together, how her eyes slightly widened, before her brow knitted together, until the toy was fully in place.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran comforting hands up her arms. “Just relax, my love.” She kicked herself. She should have prepared her. Should have used her fingers instead of letting her take it in with only lubrication for assistance.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet Agatha relaxed, and Rio caught her biting her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand cupped were the toy joined her and pushed lightly with her palm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned. “God, it’s so deep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Imagine how I’ll feel.” Rio ran her hand over the shaft jutting out towards her. “Speaking of which…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Desperate, are we?” Agatha asked as she moved over her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Always,” Rio asked as she placed her hands either side of Agatha’s waist. “Now come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand went between her legs, her fingertips teasing her entrance. Rio moaned, but reached down to stop her before she could press inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I’m not fucking you when you aren’t ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m more than ready,” Rio told her. “Please, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     She could tell Agatha wanted to argue, but she did as she asked. The shaft pressed against her entrance, pushing inside with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groan mingled with Agatha’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, that feels so good.” She wiggled her hips against the shaft, and Agatha pushed forward the rest of the way. “Fuck Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I need to move, I need to move.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Move,” Rio insisted. “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thrust into her. “Fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio arched into her. “You like it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her answer came with another thrust and a deep moan. Then another, then another, then…
    </p>
<p>
     “FUCK.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha collapsed against her, breathless and shaking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. Surely not. She hadn’t…had she?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s body calmed and she groaned against Rio’s shoulders, this time with embarrassment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio craned her neck to look at her. “Did you just…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Agatha cursed against her, this time in frustration. “Fuck. Fuck!”
    </p>
<p>
     She began to pull away, and Rio wrapped her arms around her, keeping her in place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, look at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, it happens to everyone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha propped herself up over her, cheeks flushed and face tight. “It happens to loser guys who can’t last two seconds. Not a lesbian wearing a fucking strap.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied her for a moment. “Maybe my pussy just feels that good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared down at her for a moment, before she burst into laughter. Rio caught on too, and soon they fell into a fit of giggles. Once they calmed, Rio
    </p>
<p>
     “This didn’t end up being as sexy as I hoped,” Agatha admitted breathlessly. “I’m sorry, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wasn’t sexy?” Rio hoped she was joking. “Agatha, I’m pretty much a slip and slide right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaces, but she could see the amusement in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and rolled her hips. “See.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned, thrusting her hips to meet her. “Maybe you’re right. Because you do feel amazing, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moaned and tipped her head back, getting even louder when Agatha’s lips latched on to the now exposed skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” Agatha moaned, moving to bury her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, her thrusts catching an intoxicating rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clawed at her back. It felt good, so good, but it wasn’t enough. She reached down, rubbing circles against her clit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yes. Agatha, I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha angled her hips, hitting her g-spot over and over, while the wet press of Agatha’s folds slid against her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, come. Please come. Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hips moved widely, purposely moving her hand to stimulate them both. “I’m almost there. I can feel…oh Agatha. oh god. Oh fuck. Oh AGATHA.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed the strap as far as it could go within her, her body shaking as the waves of pleasure drowned out the rest of the world. It was just her and Agatha. Their love and their pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     In the distance, Agatha groaned loudly against her neck, and shuddered against her, until they both collapsed against the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s head rested against her chest, breathless and vulnerable. Rio wrapped her arms around her and placed a gentle kiss against her forehead. She would burn the world down for that woman, and every world after.
    </p>
<p>
     So if Wanda wanted a war, she was going to get it.

<p>
     Rio sat in front of her laptop. Lilia had gone, and Agatha was at an appointment so was picking up Senõr Scratchy before coming around for their pet sleepover. That gave her plenty of time.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening Google, Rio did the one thing she told herself she’d never do. Her fingers hesitant against the keys, she typed in three words:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Darkhold Publishing Wanda.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Articles popped up, all publishing trades, about the merger. She clicked on the first one:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Darkhold Publishing have finalized their merger with award-winning illustration and animation studio, Maximoff Productions.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Maximoff Productions was created eight years ago by Wanda Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro. After her brother’s death, Maximoff has built the small studio into a thriving company of artists and animators, which now under the Darkhold banner will work exclusively for the publishing house, sharing infrastructure and intellectual properties.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stared that the photo below, showing Wanda shaking hands with a smiley man in a sharp suit. She guessed was the Mike Agatha had mentioned about before. Her eyes fixed on Wanda and glowered. She hated that bitch.
    </p>
<p>
     Her next search was
     <em>
      Wanda Maximoff
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Various results came up. Profiles for trade magazines, production announcements, accolades. All praise, praise and more praise. Rio scoffed at all the fluffy quotes and headlines. If only they knew the shit this woman had and was continuing to put her love through.
    </p>
<p>
     She decided to go on images, in the hopes she’d find an embarrassing one, maybe a time when she had spinach in her teeth or a bad hair day. Instead, all she found was Wanda looking amazing in headshots, photoshoots, premieres, award shows. It seemed anywhere Wanda went, she looked amazing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio should have stopped after that. Should have logged off and looked at her lock screen, reminding herself who Agatha actually wanted to date. But no, she scrolled on.
    </p>
<p>
     That was when she saw it.
    </p>
<p>
     There, on Google for all to see, was Wanda and Agatha, both dressed in complementary formal dresses. She opened the image fully in a new tab. It was a candid shot at some kind of event, both laughing together. Agatha looked younger, freer. Happy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but stare. She looked so beautiful, but it hurt. It was stupid really. That was the past, and she was expecting Agatha to knock on her own front door at any moment, but it still fed the nugget of doubt that had begun to grow in her mind. Wanda was successful, established, beautiful, and existed in Agatha’s world more than she did. What did she have to offer? A tarantula Agatha wouldn’t go near, an unfinished PhD, and a boatload of childhood trauma? It wasn’t a fair contest.
    </p>
<p>
     She was about to dig further when her phone screen lit up, revealing her and Agatha grinningin the botanical gardens. Rio smiled at the selfie, and then at the message she’d received.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      We’re on our way up.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      We can’t wait to see you!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Closing her laptop, she threw it on her bed and cleared her desk, ready for Senõr Scratchy’s arrival. She saw Webbers was wandering around her enclosure and pointed at her warningly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t fuck this up for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Webbers settled in the corner of her enclosure, waiting for her sleepover buddy to arrive.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio headed to the living area in time to hear a knock at the door. With a grin, she went to open it, revealing her gorgeous girlfriend and her adorable bunny…and a ridiculously large suitcase.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you moving in?” she joked as she took Senõr Scratchy’s travel cage from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I only brought the essentials for me and my boy,” Agatha insisted. “Now, where is he going?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio led them both through to her room and placed Scratchy on her desk. “He has the place of honour.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked and leaned over to whisper in her ear. “I believe I’ll have the true place of honour later when I have my head between your thighs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip. Oh she hoped that was a promise.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fussed around the rabbit cage and started unpacking her suitcase. Most of the stuff was for Scratchy: food and spare bedding and straw in case of an emergency. Though she had brought three outfits (not including a pair of cosy pyjamas which Rio was certain wouldn’t stay on for long). She’d also brought a book, and Rio couldn’t help but chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re serious about this reading date, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You agreed and I’m holding you to it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her cheek softly. “I can’t wait, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned into her, a soft smile on her face. “Are we getting takeout for dinner?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I asked Lilia to make us Lasagne.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, before kissing her softly. “If you’re trying to woo me, it’s working.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, because I have a lot of wooing to make up for. What with all your fancy dinners and posh galas.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That reminds me, I’ve spoken to Jen and Alice. I’ve booked you and Alice a shopping appointment at my favourite store.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “Why aren’t I going with you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen and I are going together another time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled. “There goes my fantasy of changing room sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We can put a pin in that,” Agatha promised. “I want something to look forward to that night. Galas are stressful when you’ve got to network. At least this way, we can surprise each other with how amazing we look.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you wearing a suit?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want me to?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought for a second, before shrugging. “You’ll look sexy either way. You look sexy in everything, and nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes before pulling Rio by her shirt. “Come on. I want some of that lasagne.”
    </p>
<p>
     After an early dinner, Rio suggested they get a bath.
    </p>
<p>
     “A bath?” Agatha frowned. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought it would be nice. I have bubble bath.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply raised her eyebrows. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Creature comforts.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, let’s do this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio prepared the bath while Agatha tended to Senõr Scratchy. Once she was all done, she called through. “Sweetheart, it’s ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked into the bathroom, a stressed look on her face. “We best be quick. Your spider is eyeing my rabbit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Tarantula,” Rio corrected, “and I doubt she can even see him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know what I saw.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled off her shirt, instantly ending the argument.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have I ever told you that I love your eversion to underwear?” Agatha said as she began taking off her own clothes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You may have mentioned it.” Rio kicked their discarded clothes to the corner of the room, before putting her hands on her hips. “So, how we doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be the big spoon,” Agatha answered swiftly, and climbed into the tub before Rio could argue.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was settled, she spread her legs welcomingly. “Come on in, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio climbed into the bath, carefully manoeuvring herself until she was sat between Agatha’s legs, her lover’s breasts pressed against her as a gentle hand encouraged her to lay back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her shoulder. “Oh, I definitely like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed in agreement, closing her eyes as she settled back against her girlfriend. Why hadn’t they done this before?
    </p>
<p>
     When she felt a mischievous hand sneak down to trace her pelvic bone, she remembered why.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, we’re meant to be relaxing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “This is relaxing.” Agatha trailed a line of kisses down the curve of her neck, and Rio bit her lip to suppress a groan. “Unless you want me to stop.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I never said that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s teeth grazed her neck. “Lie back, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did just that as Agatha’s hand pushed against her thigh, encouraging her to spread her legs. She opened up as much as the tub would allow, enough for Agatha to hook her right hand under her knee to pull it up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” she praised. “I’ve got you. Just relax.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes again, the warm water prickling against her skin, as Agatha’s had slid down further.
    </p>
<p>
     She found her clit with ease. Rio swore Agatha’s fingers shared some kind of magnetism with it, because every time she hit the right spot without even trying. She bit her lip as her girlfriend’s fingertips continued to tease, shots of pleasure coursing through her.
    </p>
<p>
     It soon wasn’t enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, baby,” Rio groaned. “I need more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you need?” Agatha teeth grazed her earlobe. “Tell me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I need you in me,” Rio said without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very good, my love.” Agatha’s hand slid lower, and she didn’t wait before pressing a finger inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand threw back, grasping the back of Agatha’s head, that had buried itself in the crook of her neck, mauling at her like a horny vampire. After a few thrusts, she added a second digit, and Rio moaned loudly. Thankfully Lilia wasn’t home, though it would have been the perfect revenge for earlier that week.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s movements were leisurely. No urgency, no drive, no determination. Just a desire to make every moment as pleasurable as the last.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s toes curled. “Another.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Another?” Agatha’s voice ticked her neck. “Sure you can take it, honey?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know I can,” Rio replied, groaning as Agatha’s responding chuckle vibrated against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do, my love. You’re so good for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha added a third finger, and Rio saw stars.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was done, her body twitching and breaths deep, Agatha pulled her closer. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist before resting her chin against her shoulder. “We need to share a bath more often.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could only nod, but she most certainly agreed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had to admit, the bath had been
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     enjoyable, but she was glad when they finally got round to her most anticipated event of the evening- snuggling up on the couch with a good book. Well, she was reading a good book. Rio was reading
     <em>
      her

     book.
    </p>
<p>
     She peaked over the top of her book. The manuscript was printed on A4, so only the top of Rio’s hair poked out from behind it. Agatha wished she could see even a little bit of her face. Because it was her favourite face in the world, of course, but also to gauge her reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     The only other person who’d read it before was Rebecca, and Agatha was certain she hadn’t finished it, and she wasn’t the most impartial critic. She had a feeling Rio would also insist it was a masterpiece or think so simply through her blinding devotion. Still, she wanted to read her micro-expressions, to get a genuine insight into her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     In a way, Rio was the person she wanted to like it most, but she worried it would have the opposite effect. That she would think her untalented and ridiculous for even attempting to follow her dream of being an author. She knew realistically that her girlfriend would never think such a thing, but those formative years with Evanora had made her cautious. Guarded. And this? Rio reading the product of her imagination? Well, she was pretty much giving her a loaded pistol and giving her a clear shot at her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     “There doesn’t seem to be much reading going on over there,” Rio commented from behind the manuscript. “Your staring is putting me off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “This isn’t working for me,” she admitted. “You’re too far away.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scooted over, settling into Agatha’s side. “Better?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wrapped her free arm around her, holding her close. “Much.”
    </p>
<p>
     They continued to read, or rather Rio did, and Agatha tried to. She couldn’t help but steal glances Rio’s way, until she simply couldn’t take it anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think so far?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it,” Rio answered. “But I’ll share my full thoughts when I’m done. Which will be like ten years from now if you carry on looking at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her bookmark between the pages of her own book and set it aside. “I can’t help it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You wanted to have a reading date,” Rio reminded her. “You’re the resident book worm, not me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but you’re so much more interesting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really?” Rio carefully set the manuscript on the coffee table, before moving to straddle Agatha’s lap. “Agatha Harkness, scary book lady, distracted by little old me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Always.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned down and kissed her deeply. “I believe I owe you a mind-blowing orgasm.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m okay,” Agatha answered quickly, “Getting you off gets me off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up, concern etched on her face. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine. I just don’t feel like having sex right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, right, yeah, of course.” Rio went to shift off her lap, but Agatha’s hands quickly stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honey, don’t look so sad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not sad, I just…has something happened? Usually, you can’t get enough of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I couldn’t get enough of you in the bath not too long ago,” Agatha was quick to remind her, but Rio shrugged it off.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know but are you…are you sick of me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened. “Am I what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, bored.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d never be bored of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’re really just not in the mood? Or is this about…is this about last night?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but look away.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is!” Rio cupped her cheeks, lifting her face so their eyes met once more. “Sweetheart, I know you didn’t expect it to happen so quickly, but I thought it was really hot…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not that,” Agatha insisted. “Well, it is, kind of. I’ve just never felt that out of control before and, I don’t know, it…it scared me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay to lose control,” Rio assured her. “Some might say its good to let loose once in a while.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t lose control,” Agatha stated firmly. “I’ve given into temptation, and sure maybe I’ve been a little impulsive, but
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was like…like I couldn’t control myself, and I need to, Rio. I need to keep in control.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I disagree,” Rio countered. “You can trust me, Agatha. You know that. You can lose control with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. She couldn’t do this right now. “Look, can we just put a pin in this for tonight? Just, I don’t know, curl up on your bed and spend time with our animals. At separate times, of course. And I won’t be in the room if your tarantula is out of its cage.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Enclosure,” Rio corrected. “But fine. We need to talk about this properly though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We will,” Agatha promised, though she hoped Rio would forget by morning.
    </p>
<p>
     They headed into Rio’s room, and Agatha was pleased to see Senõr Scratchy safe and sound. She got him out for a cuddle, before handing him into Rio’s waiting arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know at some point you’ll need to hold Webbers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not happening.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Agatha. She’s practically family.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “That spider is no family of mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was then she noticed something on top of the chest of draws next to Rio’s desk. Behind a row of books was the edge of a small black frame, hidden from sight. With a frown, Agatha pulled it out.
    </p>
<p>
     In the frame was an old photograph of a woman and a grinning toddler. The little girl had big brown eyes and a cute button nose, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Little Rio was adorable. And the woman with her was beautiful, with the same brown eyes and sweet smile, minus the adorable gap though.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this your mom?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio replied simply as she put Scratchy back in his cage.
    </p>
<p>
     “She looks like you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why have you hidden it away?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t look at it sometimes,” Rio admitted. “Makes me feel bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because she’s not here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Something like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put the frame back where she found it and sat on the edge of the bed. “So, what shall we do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I had a lot of ideas, but those are on pause for tonight,” Rio teased, “so it’s the guest’s choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around the room, before spotting Rio’s laptop at the far end of the bed. “Let’s watch a movie.”
    </p>
<p>
     She reached for the device, but Rio was quick to swipe it up. “We can watch it in the living room.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s easier to snuggle in here.” Agatha looked her up and down. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m fine,” Rio replied, but the way she clutched the laptop to her chest said otherwise. Agatha’s bullshit senses were tingling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there something on that laptop you don’t want me to see?”
    </p>
<p>
     “N-no.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood up and held out her hand. “Give it to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hugged it tighter. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you’re hiding something, and I want to know what.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing bad,” Rio insisted. “I mean it might look bad, but its not. I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Possibilities raced through Agatha’s brain, from elicit chat rooms to a secret criminal empire. “I’d like to see for myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Shoulders slumped in defeat, Rio handed over the laptop. Agatha opened it, finding it had been locked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Password?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio mumbled something she couldn’t quite make out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha123, with a capitol A.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head as she typed in the password. Her finger hovered over the enter button. A part of her didn’t want to know, to carry on ignorant bliss, but she knew she couldn’t. She clicked the button, and an image filled the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     An image of her and Wanda at an event. The ‘Writers of the Future’ gala if she wasn’t mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart sank. “Oh, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped down defeatedly to sit on the edge of the bed, and Agatha moved to sit beside her, the laptop resting in her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honey, why were you looking at this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I found it by accident,” Rio admitted. “I was looking up Wanda. I know it was stupid, and now I wish I never had, because now all I can think about is that stupid photo.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at the photograph with a frown. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you look so happy there, and so glamorous, and Wanda is so successful and beautiful that, I don’t know, I don’t quite feel eno-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you dare finish that sentence,” Agatha told her. “You’re more than enough, Rio. You’re everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I’m not,” Rio said so harshly it made Agatha flinch, and when she looked into those beautiful brown eyes, she found them glazed with tears. “Maybe one day I’ll be a semi-successful botanist that’ll make an okay salary and will be remembered in a hundred years as a footnote in my stepmother’s wiki page. Wanda, she has all these awards…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Her company almost went bankrupt three times when we were together, and she had to borrow money to keep it afloat. Most of those awards are thanks to people she’s worked with, not herself, and most importantly I don’t love her. I love you. I’m stupidly in love with you. We could have nothing, and I wouldn’t care.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her sceptically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, maybe I would care, but you know what I mean.” Agatha looked at the photo. “That was one photo from that night. I don’t even remember what we found so funny, but I do remember the blazing argument we had on the way home and that I slept on the couch for two nights after.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What was the argument about?” Rio asked, at which Agatha laughed bitterly.
    </p>
<p>
     “At that point, we were arguing over everything and anything. I think it was the time I put my hand on a woman’s forearm. An old work friend, no less.”
    </p>
<p>
     Looking back, she couldn’t blame Wanda for wanting to leave. She perhaps wanted to as well but was too settled to admit it even to herself. That was no excuse for her betrayal though, nor her recent behaviour.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m terrified of losing you,” Rio admitted. “I don’t know how to live without you anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll never happen.” Agatha took her hand and squeezed it tight. “Nothing will break us apart. I won’t let it, and you know how stubborn I can be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled, before looking up at her with uncertain eyes. “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her for a moment, her mouth slightly agape, prepared to say whatever words that had stuck themselves in her throat. Then, like a flick of a switch, she smiled widely and reached over to close the image tab of the search engine.
    </p>
<p>
     “What film shall we watch?”

<p>
     Agatha was beginning to hate Mondays.
    </p>
<p>
     For starters, it meant her uninterrupted time with Rio was over, which always sucked. Then there was the backlog of emails that she was beginning to task Sharon with more often than not because she had lost interest in reading them all, and the fresh pile of manuscripts that were mostly below par…
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, and she had to see Wanda Maximoff. That was the main issue.
    </p>
<p>
     That Monday morning there was a meeting between all the top players. Unfortunately, she made the cut.  She arrived at the conference room early and made herself a coffee, before selecting a seat at the far end of the table. Her plan was to nod along and bite her tongue long enough to get through the hour without a formal complaint being made about her attitude.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d been told she was one strike away from a mindfulness course and that was NOT happening.
    </p>
<p>
     More people started filtering in soon after, choosing to sit either at the front, eager for brownie points, or in the happy middle. Some tried to sit by her, but she shot them a glare and they quickly left her alone. She hated them all with a passion simply for the fact it was 9am and they weren’t her girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     To her, that was a good enough reason.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda arrived surprisingly (annoyingly) promptly, and the air shift in the room upon her entrance. Everyone else looked at her adoringly, eager to earn the attention of the company’s new golden girl. Yet, of course, Wanda only had eyes for her. Their eyes had met almost instantly, but Agatha had quickly looked down at her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had a meeting with her thesis advisor that morning, and she didn’t want to bother her, so instead she shot Jen a message.
    </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>
      Wtf?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She saw a flash of red in her peripheral vision, and looked up to see Wanda had taken the spot opposite her. There were still plenty of extra seats, much better for someone who will most likely be at the centre of the meeting’s agenda. But no, she had to sit right opposite her with those pesky green eyes and irritating smile, which only grew when Agatha glared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could attempt to speak to her, however, Wanda’s attention was pulled elsewhere.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey Wanda, did you have a good weekend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did, thank you.” Wanda’s voice was so sweet it made Agatha want to gag. “Did you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, just same old same old,” the person, a manager in another department whose name Agatha hadn’t bothered to remember, continued. “Did you get up to anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was my weekend with the twins, so we had some quality time at the zoo.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that sounds amazing! How old are they?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Three in a few months.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked. Had it been that long already?
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s adorable!” the busy-body manager gushed. “What are their names? Did you give them matching ones?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda chuckled. “No. Seeing as there were two of them, we decided to name one each. Their dad wanted to name one after his dad, so he named one Tommy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried not to listen. She had guessed long ago, when she gave a fuck what Wanda was doing, that one of her twins had to be called Pietro, in honour of her brother. She didn’t need that confirming. Instead, she checked her news app and took a sip of her coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what name did you choose?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jolted in her seat, chocking on the hot liquid stuck in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone looked her way, both in confusion and concern. Everyone except Wanda. No, she had the infuriating ability to keep her face totally blank to the rest of the world, while allowing Agatha to read it like a book.
    </p>
<p>
     This one spelled amusement, and Agatha wanted to punch her in the face.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet she couldn’t. She had to play ball.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she put on a look of exasperation and held up her phone. “Ain’t the news just crap these days.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sat awkwardly in her chair, watching as her advisor read over the new draft of her thesis.
    </p>
<p>
     Doctor Odinsdottir was the best lecturer in the college, if Rio said so herself, though she had been taking a break from academia to work on a new project that took her back to her native Scandinavia. Yet, despite her sabbatical, the acclaimed botanist had insisted on still being Rio’s thesis advisor.
    </p>
<p>
     Most of the time, they spoke over teams or by email, but the proclaimed professor was back in town for a while and wanted to meet face to face.
    </p>
<p>
     Though Rio had always gotten on well with the professor, and had thrived under her mentorship, she was still nervous. Nervous she would disappoint her somehow. That it wouldn’t be good enough and the person she had looked up to for almost ten years would see her as nothing but a failure.
    </p>
<p>
     Hela leaned back in her chair and closed her laptop, before meeting Rio’s anxious gaze with her masterful poker face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well?” Rio prompted. “Is it okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela tapped her fingers against the top of her laptop. “Is it okay? No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s heart dropped. She knew it. She’d let herself slip. Lilia had warned her. Agatha had warned her. She had been too busy masterminding a fake relationship and falling in real love with her fake girlfriend that she’d let all those years of work fall to the wayside.  That was it. It was ever. She’d never graduate. She’d never work in botany. She’d never…
    </p>
<p>
     Hela’s lips grew into a smile, a mischievous gleam glistening in those ice blue eyes.  “It’s great. Seriously, I’d even be proud of writing this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela nodded. “I can’t wait to show this to my colleagues. Seriously, this could lead to some groundbreaking stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but grin. “That’s amazing, Hela. Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, thank
     <em>
      you.
     </em>
     And I must say, it reads really well. No spelling mistakes at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My girlfriend makes me read it to her and she tells me when things don’t sound right,” Rio explained. “She doesn’t get the scientific stuff, though. She’s more on the artsy side.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela smirked. “A girlfriend? About time. What’s her name?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Rio got out her phone and showed off her phone screen. “She works in publishing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a catch, but is treating you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No complaints at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad.” Hela then opened the laptop again and began tapping away at something. “I have to give you something to work on, so I’ll give you one piece of advice. A way to make this stand out from the rest.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward. “Tell me and I’ll do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Add that personal touch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That what?” Rio frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember when you were in freshman year and you came to me wanting to join my already full class?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remembered. She had been so desperate to join the class that she had sought after the professor during her office hours to plead her case. It had taken some persuading, but Hela had eventually agreed, and when she finished top of the class by a mile, she soon became Doctor Odindottir’s little protégé.
    </p>
<p>
     “You came to me, and you said you wanted to join the class,” Hela recalled. “You told me how interested you were, and I was a little disappointed you had been shut out, but most of the class were juniors and seniors. I couldn’t move heaven and earth so an eager freshman could sit lost at the back. Then you told me your name, and I asked you…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You knew what happened to my mom,” Rio concluded. “And you asked me why I wanted to take this class after that happened to her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela nodded. “And what did you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed harshly. “I wanted to make sure no one made that mistake again.”
    </p>
<p>
     The professor leaned back in her chair. “There you go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t understand?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your research has a reason, a purpose in the grand scope of things. Yet sharing what this means to you, sharing how this could prevent such a horrible thing from happening again. I think that would be…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exploitative?” Rio suggested. “I have to be honest, I don’t feel comfortable with this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela held her hands up. “I’m just giving a suggestion. And it’s not exploitative. It’s real, and it’s what makes you a good botanist. Because for you, this is personal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered the professor’s words. She understood, of course she did, but the thought made her stomach lurch. It just didn’t…she didn’t…it was too complicated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just think about it,” Hela suggested. “Shall we meet against next week? Perhaps grab lunch?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Lunch sounds good.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Can you believe her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I certainly can’t,” Sharon replied. “What a strange young lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been in a fowl mood after the meeting. The events before it even began had already soured her, yet the meeting ran over by half an hour which had meant more time under Wanda’s beady gaze. The moment it ended, she bolted out the door without pleasantries or decorum, stomping through the corridors like an intern’s worst nightmare.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon, in her wisdom, had decided a walk would do some good, and they could pick up some lunch along the way. Agatha had bit her tongue for a while, but by the time they’d picked up their boxed lunches (Agatha got a Greek salad and a sandwich for Rio in case she showed up), she desperately had to tell someone what happened.
    </p>
<p>
     It seemed her assistant was the perfect sounding board in the absence of Rio, though in a way she was glad her girlfriend wasn’t there. The Wanda stuff was clearly getting to Rio, and Agatha needed to blow off steam before she told her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what to do,” Agatha said as they stood in the elevator on their way back to the office. “I hate her so much, but I’m stuck with her here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you looked for another job?” Sharon suggested. “Surely another publisher would snap you up?”
    </p>
<p>
     They would. She got calls all the time trying to scout her, but why should she leave? She had worked her way from the very bottom to get where she was, and why
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     she leave because Wanda was a clingy little bitch?
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not leaving,” Agatha said with her head held high. “This is my company. I’m not letting it go without a fight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon gave her a sympathetic look. “Honey, sometimes letting go of something is better than letting it drag you down. It’s taken me way too long to realise that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond, and instead watched the digital display go up and up.
    </p>
<p>
     When they made it to their floor, they walked side by side across the floor to their office space. Once they got there, they were surprised to find a pretty brunette loitering by Sharon’s desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and strode ahead, balancing the food in one hand so she could pull Rio into a one-armed hug. “What a wonderful surprise, my love. How was your meeting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio replied. “Well, mostly. What about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled a face, and Rio seemed to read it. She nodded in understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to talk then?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Seems so. I got lunch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I got drinks.” Rio nodded to the three identical iced coffees on Sharon’s desk. “Care to join the venting session, Sharon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh no, dear,” Sharon replied as she went to unbutton her coat. “I have a lot to get on with. Agatha has already filled me in on her side of things, anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a good listener. She even lets me finish a story without stupi….” Agatha stopped, watching as Rio’s eyes widened, a look of horror appearing on her face. “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to talk,” Rio took the food from her and grabbed her arm, pulling her towards the office door. “Bye Sharon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But your coffees!” Sharon protested, and Agatha managed to swipe them up as she went.
    </p>
<p>
     Once in the office, Rio dragged Agatha across the office, as far away from the door as they could get. She dumped the food on the coffee table and began to pace the length of the window.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is wrong with you?” Agatha scolded while putting the drinks down also. “Why are you being weird?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran a stressed hand through her hair. “I’m freaking out. Oh God, this is…oh my God…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, speak,” she demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know when I heard Lilia having crazy screamy sex with her new hook up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How could I forget? You almost gave me a heart attack that night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved her off. “Remember when I said there was a granny sweater on the floor?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Vaguely.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Sharon is wearing that exact same sweater right now!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “So Sharon shops at the same place as Lilia’s mystery woman?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just stared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     The penny dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand shot up to cover her mouth. “No!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!”
    </p>
<p>
     “So she and Lilia are…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Having sex.” Rio nodded. “And I fucking
     <em>
      heard
     </em>
     them!”
    </p>
<p>
     Another wave of horror washed over Agatha. “Sharon is the screamer?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grimaced. “This is a nightmare! I’m never going to be able to look at her the same again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me neither,” Agatha admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     They stood there in silence, the new information slowly sinking in…
    </p>
<p>
     Then, they burst into hysterics.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not funny,” Rio said though her own laughter. “Please, Agatha, I’m traumatised!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat on the arm of the couch, wiping tears from her eyes. “I’m sorry, Rio, but this is the funniest thing ever.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not! I thought Sharon was straight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon herself probably thought she was until Lilia came along,” Agatha mused. “Good for her, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in agreement. “Lilia is happy too. It seems like our love just keeps bringing people together. First Jen and Alice, and now Sharon and Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen and Alice don’t count. They had no idea we’d met. And if you say it’s that damn invisible string again, I’m kicking you out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pouted. “You said you liked Folklore?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up and let’s have lunch.”
    </p>
<p>
     They settled on the couch, Rio inhaling her sandwich before Agatha had barely got the lid off her salad.
    </p>
<p>
     “So how was your meeting with your advisor?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It went well. Hela said…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hela?” Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You’re on a first name basis with your professor?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t get jealous. She’s married, and I only have eyes for you, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Better stay that way, too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked with amusement. “Anyway, she said my work is good. Really good. There wasn’t any criticism, really.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s amazing!” Agatha leaned over and kissed her cheek. “So you’re done?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I still have some data to add, and I…Hela wants me to add something else to it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio played with the sandwich wrappings in her lap, and Agatha instantly knew something was up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She wants me to put in about what happened to my mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you don’t want to?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she said it could make a big difference. I mean, I thought about it on the way here and people are going to heed to the advice knowing it’s been given by someone…” Rio looked down at the wrappings again. “I just don’t want to open all that up again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand,” Agatha reached out and squeezed her hand. “No matter what you decide, your thesis is going to save lives, and I couldn’t be prouder to call you my partner.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Partner?” Rio’s eyes gleamed. “So I’m not just your girlfriend anymore?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve never been
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     anything to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted their joined hands and kissed Agatha’s knuckles, agreeing without the need for words. “What about you? How was your meeting?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Besides Wanda casually dropping she named one of her demon spawns after my nephew? Pretty boring.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped her hand. “She
     <em>
      what?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “I couldn’t believe it. Why the hell would she do that? I mean it’s a common name, but the coincidence…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Was she even close to Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, and that’s what makes this even worse.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s her game?” Rio questioned, and Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who knows? But I’m not playing. I just want to focus on the good things, especially my super girlfriend who’s going to take the world of botany by storm.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, before leaning over to pick at Agatha’s salad. “What’s in this anyway?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t know what’s in a Greek salad?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had another meeting, but she insisted Rio stay and pointed her towards the staff library on the other side of the floor. It had everything from unabridged editions to advanced reader copies of the company’s best work.  Rio would rather pass the time reading Agatha’s masterpiece, but that was safe in her room under the watchful guard of Webbers, so she had to settle for lesser works.
    </p>
<p>
     She was reading the back of one when she heard a voice behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I enjoyed that one. The twist at the end kept me up at night, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to see Wanda stood by one of the other bookshelves, a confident smile gracing her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     How she hated that woman’s stupid face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned away from her and put the book back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you mad at me now?” Wanda asked. “We got on so well before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know who you were then,” Rio reminded her. “But you played on that, didn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t play,” Wanda replied, at which Rio scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, all you do is play games.” She turned to face her again. “Like naming your kid after Billy? What? Was Aga
     <em>
      thor
     </em>
     too on the nose? Or Harker? You could have gotten away with that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Forgive me that I wanted to have something of hers,” Wanda snapped. “I was grieving. I was lost. I made a mistake, and I love my boys, but I never meant to lose her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you did lose her,” Rio confirmed. “And that sucks for you, but it’s over. Leave us alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you can.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda folded her arms. “Could you walk away from her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This isn’t about me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Answer the question,” Wanda pressed. “You say you love her so much, can you honestly say you could walk away from her and never look back?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to stare her down, but her gaze soon dropped to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Wanda spoke up again. “You can’t judge me for loving her when you do exactly the same.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The difference is I wouldn’t hurt her like you did,” Rio snapped. “I never ever would.”
    </p>
<p>
     The amusement had dropped from Wanda’s perky facade, revealing the true face that lay beneath. One that was cold and pained and ruthless. She stepped up to Rio, their identical height making her wild eyes impossible to avoid.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t want to push me, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you don’t want to push me,” Rio countered, pure rage causing through her. “You have no idea what I’m capable of, Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that a challenge?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a threat,” Rio told her. “Leave us alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, she grabbed a random book off the shelf and stormed off. She heard Wanda laughter echoing far behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nice talking to you, Rio. See you next time.”

<p>
     Agatha decided to take the day off from work. She needed a break from that place before she committed a homicide.
    </p>
<p>
     She noticed Rio was off after she got back from her meeting and it had taken much persuading when they got back to the apartment for her to voice what happened. To say Agatha was angry would be an understatement. She was ready to track Wanda down there and then, but then Rio had asked if they could cuddle and watch a movie, and who was she to refuse?
    </p>
<p>
     So, instead, she focused on other things. She woke up snuggled with her beautiful girlfriend, had a shower together that was steamy in more ways than one, went to a café for breakfast, and walked Rio to campus before heading off to meet Jen for their shopping visit. Pure perfection.
    </p>
<p>
     Or so it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen waited until they were in the store, searching the racks of dresses and pant suits for the gala that Friday, before she decided to start her meddling.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you, Rio, sex. Discuss.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not talking about our sex life with you,” Agatha replied as she put yet another dress back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on! I need to know everything! Is it good at least?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine, it’s amazing. Happy now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen squealed. “I knew it! That sexual energy was too strong to not be mind-blowing! So, is she the best you’ve ever had?”
    </p>
<p>
     “As crudely as you put it, yes. She’s the best I’ve ever had in every way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen patted her on the back. “I’m so happy for you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you.” Agatha felt a smile pull at her lips. “We’re happy too. If I can only get rid of Wanda, then we’ll be just grand.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe the audacity of that bitch,” Jen huffed. “I can’t wait to see her on Friday. I’m going to spill red wine down her dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cackled at the thought. “You have my full permission to do so.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen picked out a few dresses, and Agatha chose a dress and suit she quite liked. They headed to the changing rooms to try them out, and Agatha hoped that would be the end of the sex conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “So have you two gone all the way,” Jen asked from her dressing room.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Agatha asked as she pulled on the dress. “Do I need to explain the many layers of lesbian sex to you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed. “I mean have you, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t know.” Agatha pulled back her curtain and stepped out to look in the mirror. “I don’t know about this dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen emerged in a bright pink dress that looked like a big feather boa. She looked Agatha up and down. “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No good?” Agatha looked down at herself. She liked the dress itself. Liked the shade of red, the shape, and mostly the neckline. But Jen was right. It didn’t look right on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’d prefer it on someone else,” Jen teased, earning a glare. Though Agatha had to admit, Rio would look amazing in red.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do I look?” Jen did a twirl for emphasis.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a flamingo,” Agatha sassed before returning behind her curtain to try on the suit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rude,” she heard Jen huff, then pull her own curtain shut. “You avoided my question.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What question?” Agatha asked as she got out of the dress. “All I remember is you talking in riddles.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want mean to be blunt?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for the suit trousers and began climbing into them. “If it means I’ll understand what you’re saying, sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean have you given her your strap virginity yet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha almost stumbled through the curtain. “Jesus, Jen!”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard her friend cackle. “I’ll take that as a no then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, of course not. I strap up, not the other way round.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I get it’s not your thing, but you’re missing out. Alice may be great with a strap, but she loves it when we switch too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You two switch?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. I mean not often, but sometimes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tucked her t-shirt into the trousers. “Rio and I don’t do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What, is Rio against strapping up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but she knows I don’t want to, so that’s fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’ve never discussed it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused. “I never said that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it! You want the strap! You’re so weak for her that you want that strap so bad!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up!” Agatha hissed. She stormed out from behind the curtain and looked over her attire. The suit was better, even if she had to substitute the planned white dress shirt for the Lorna Wu tour tee Rio had gotten her for her birthday. Still, it looked great.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen emerged from the changing room in a gorgeous baby pink dress that flowed so beautifully she looked like a goddess. And that was Agatha’s opinion as Jen’s best friend and biggest hater. She figured Alice would practically salivate.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen whistled. “Look at you, hot stud.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not too bad yourself,” Agatha said as they stood side by side in front of the mirror. “Hopefully we’ll look at least half as good as our ladies, because I have a feeling Rio’s look will be the death of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Simp,” Jen teased. “Just let her strap you so we can all move on with our lives.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Need I remind you, she’s practically your sister-in-law.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet,” Jen pointed out. “Alice and I already agreed a year before we even consider moving in together, let alone anything else.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, why? Do you think that’s too quick?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, not at all.” Agatha busied herself looking at a suit jacket. “Do you not see a future with Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I do. I love her. I’m also an adult who wants a healthy, chill relationship? Why, are you…wait, are you and Rio moving in together?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve talked about it,” Agatha admitted. “We want to get a new place together when my lease is up, then after she graduates, we’re going to look at other things.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Other things?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you know, like kids and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “KIDS?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I mean we both want at least one, so we want to look at our options…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, just rewind a little.” Jen took hold of her shoulders. “Are you telling me you’re planning to have kids with this woman, and you haven’t let her strap you yet?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you kidding me?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “A lot of lesbians only give, Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know but I think you should still try it at least once. I understand you have your reasons, but if you’re going all in with Rio then maybe you should consider it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I’ll think about thinking about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was a lie. She’d thought about it plenty already. Even dreamed about it once, but that didn’t mean anything…right?
    </p>
<p>
     “Or at least consider it before you even think about marriage,” Jen added. “Not that I wouldn’t love to be a bridesmaid…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Jen a sheepish look and watched as her friend’s eyes grew wide.
    </p>
<p>
     “AGATHA HARKNESS, YOU BETTER BE KIDDING ME?!”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Can I at least get a clue,” Rio begged as they walked up the Kaplan’s driveway. “Like the style or the colour? Anything!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope,” Agatha replied. “It’s a surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, then you’ll hear nothing about my choice tomorrow,” Rio declared, praying Agatha took the bait. Unfortunately, her girlfriend didn’t bite.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, then we can surprise each other on Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio whined. “But I want to know
     <em>
      now.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine, it’s a…”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Asshole!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cackled as she rang her sister’s doorbell. “Honey, you will get to see it on Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know. I just get impatient. You’re like my hyperfixation.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well concentrate on how cute I look tonight then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. She had been playing with Agatha’s hair and put two little braids at the top of her hair, just enough to pull it from her face. Even Agatha admitted she looked adorable and allowed her to take some photos. Persuading her to keep them in for dinner was an entirely different battle, one she won by promising to let Agatha play with her hair later on. Needless to say, the braids stayed put.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rebecca opened the door, she greeted Rio with a smile, before doing a double take at her sister.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look…pretty.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t ask so surprised,” Agatha huffed as she pushed her way into the house. “Where’s my nephew?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca looked to Rio once more and gave her an impressed nod. “She never let me play with her hair, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I’m special, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca chuckled. “You most definitely are.”
    </p>
<p>
     After dinner, the Kaplan’s dispersed, and while his dad headed out to watch a game at a neighbours and his mom dragged Agatha upstairs to help her sort through something, Rio found herself needing to entertain Billy. Or perhaps it was the other way around? She couldn’t be sure.
    </p>
<p>
     They ended up sat in the living room, watching the Sonic the Hedgehog movie on the TV. Though she would never give Agatha the ammunition, she had to admit she was quite enjoying it, until she noticed Billy getting twitchy.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s up, kid?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” he quickly deflected, but he continued to fidget nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on,” she encouraged. “Is it that note business from class?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That? No, no, nothing has happened with that. Teddy and I have been hanging out a bit, though. You know, between classes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “That’s good, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess.” He looked back at the TV, but Rio could tell he wasn’t watching it. “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you love Agatha? Like really love her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio answered. “In fact, I really, really, really love her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you wouldn’t hurt her, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. “I’d never hurt her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you promise?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked at her, his face serious. “You know about my accident, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, then you know I don’t have many early memories of anything, or anyone. I have some, but not like most people. So my first memories of everyone, the memories that are clear, are pretty recent. My first memory of Agatha was the day I woke up, or rather the night. The first memories I have of my parents are them crying beside me while the doctors crowded me, and I was scared, but now I understand they were scared too. Still, it was a lot. It most have exhausted me or something, because I passed out not long after. I remember the next time I woke up it was dark, and the only light in the room was the security light. My parents weren’t there. I guess they must have stopped home or something. I was glad people weren’t crowding me, but I was still scared. I didn’t know what was going on or who I was. I didn’t want to be alone. Then I saw Agatha. She was asleep in a chair at the end of my bed, an open book in her lap. I don’t know. Maybe it was some kind of muscle memory in my brain that the crash just couldn’t get rid of, but as soon as I saw her, I felt safe. I guess I could feel her love even if I didn’t remember it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. Agatha’s love was powerful. She knew that first hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy continued. “I know she loves you, like a lot. Maybe almost as much as she loves me. Almost.”
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t help but chuckle. “Okay, I get it. You’re her favourite.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Joint favourite…with Senõr Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, kid. I get it. I’m third in line.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she does love you a lot. Like a lot a lot. And I just wanted to make sure you felt the same way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed him suspiciously. “Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s brought all this on? Has something happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t say.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’m not meant to know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “About what? Billy, please, you’re kind of worrying me right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked towards the living room door before turning up the volume on the TV. Rio was about to question what was going on before he shifted on the couch to face her fully.
    </p>
<p>
     “I heard my parents talking, and I heard my mom saying about Agatha’s grandmother’s ring.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom said she thinks Agatha needs to get it cleaned.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dad asked why, and she said because Agatha might need it soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “For what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy gave her a nervous look.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s frown deepened. Agatha? A ring? Needing it soon? What was Billy getting a-
    </p>
<p>
     The pieces fell together, and something akin to the Big Bang happened in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted in her seat. Fuck, this was happening. Or at least in the preparations of happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Marriage.
    </p>
<p>
     To Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon?
    </p>
<p>
     Her head was going to explode.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t freak out!” Billy pleaded. “I shouldn’t have told you! Look, she hasn’t planned anything, but I got scared, okay? I needed to find out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Find out what?” Rio asked, her brain going absolutely haywire.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you’d say no.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. “Would you want me so say no?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No! I love you, Rio. I’d love for you to be my aunt.”
    </p>
<p>
     Warmth filled Rio’s frantic heart, yet she knew he wasn’t finished. “But?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want you to break her heart.”
    </p>
<p>
     She searched his face, a face he saw more of Agatha in every day. She looked into his worried eyes and gave him the best smile she could while her mind, body and soul struggled to comprehend this new information.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d break my own heart before I broke hers. I swear to you, Billy. I’d never, ever, do that to her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” Billy managed a smile. “Thank you, Rio and I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be sorry, kid.” Rio reached over and pulled him into a hug. “At least I won’t faint now when it actually happens.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll cry though, won’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lika a baby.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Rebecca please enough,” Agatah groaned. “I want to go back to my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop being such a baby.” Rebecca held up another jumper. “Do you want to keep this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s the same as the last two.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like that jumper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca shook her head. “Pick one and the rest are going.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared sadly at the pile of clothes on the bed. All hers. All sentenced to the thrift store.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you said that you wanted to move stuff in here,” Rebecca reminded her. “And most of this stuff has been here since before Billy got out of hospital.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not most.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I think if you’re having a spare outfit or two here it’s only fair you make room for Rio, seeing as you’re planning to move in together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a very loose plan,” Agatha reminded her. “My lease isn’t even up yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And that’s not it.” Rebecca stood before her, hands on hips. “Jen called me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Motherfucker.” Agatha was going to kill her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, I don’t pretend to know the insights of lesbian sex-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please can we not…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, I tried watching the L Word, but I didn’t get into it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What a surprise,” Agatha replied dryly. “I don’t want to have this conversation with my straight sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well too bad because you are. I don’t see what the problem is? This obsession you have with not letting people in. Literally!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio has been inside me plenty, thank you very much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t need to know that…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then why are we having this conversation?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca sighed. “Agatha, I just want to say that I understand that you’re guarded. Fuck, if I had a childhood like yours…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please don’t make this about my mom. That’ll make me want to do it less.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, will you please just listen,” her sister huffed. “As I was saying, for some reason you have latched onto this idea that this is the last frontier of intimacy, and I just want to tell you that it’s not. You can have penetrative sex and it mean nothing and not have it and it mean everything. It’s about the person and the experience.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha understood that. Sex with Rio wasn’t sex. It was like two pieces coming together to create a whole.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never wanted to do it,” Agatha admitted. “I guess I didn’t want to have anyone touching me like that. I figured it just wasn’t my thing, like some people don’t like fingers or hate people going down on them. I thought that was just my preference.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Now I don’t know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’ve thought about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I have, but I’m too old to try something like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you’re not sky diving. You’re letting your partner stick a silicone co-”
    </p>
<p>
     The door to the bedroom opened and Rio walked in, Billy in toe.
    </p>
<p>
     Both sisters froze.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Agatha with cautious eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy glanced between them all, confused. “What’s going on? Why are you both in here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorting and talking,” Agatha answered, before studying Rio closely. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m great. Just missing you.” Rio pointed to the clothes on the bed. “What are those?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s old jumpers,” Rebecca answered. “She doesn’t need them so they’re getting donated to Goo- Rio what are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit back a laugh as Rio scoop the lot up in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re getting donated to the needy girlfriend charity,” Rio explained. “Committed to stealing any thread of their partner’s wardrobe in an effort to become apart of her through osmosis.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy grimaced. “Gross…can I have that orange one?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, kid. Why don’t we set this out in your room and decide what we each want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed as they both went, earning a glare from her sister.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Very.” Agatha replied. “And Rebecca?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “For what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Helping make up my mind.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     With two bags of Agatha’s old shirts and hoodies in the back, Rio settled in the passenger seat of her girlfriend’s car, a content smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart was still making strange little movements, and her mind was still fuzzy, but she was happy. How could she not be? Agatha loved her enough to even consider giving her a ring that had belonged to one of the most treasured people in her life. To propose to her. To marry her. To live happily ever after.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought alone was a dream, but to know there was the smallest chance that would be a reality…Rio wasn’t sure she could wait.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, as they reached the city limits, she heard Agatha clear her throat, and a jolt of anticipation ran through her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to ask you something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up. Was this it? Was she going to ask her then? In the car? Just like that?
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s not really a question,” Agatha specified. “More a request.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned. This was a strange way of proposing. “Okay…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept her eyes on the road, but she could see her hands were gripping the steering wheel tight and watched her suck in a deep breath. Rio braced herself. Oh god, she was going to ask, and she was going to say yes, and then…
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you to fuck me.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was…not what she expected.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want me to fuck you?” Rio repeated. “Okay, I mean, I kind of hoped…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio,” Agatha interrupted. “You don’t understand. I want you to fuck me with a strap.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened, her mouth dropping open, and she was sure she looked ridiculous, but she couldn’t help it. If a possible proposal was a surprise, well this…there wasn’t words to describe it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t look at me like that,” Agatha huffed. “Look, just forget…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh no, no, no. I’m not forgetting anything. You want me to strap you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t,” Agatha grumbled, and Rio couldn’t help but grin. Oh, this was going to be fun.
    </p>
<p>
     They made it back to the apartment, and after saying a quick hello to Senõr Scratchy, Rio turned her attention to the task at hand. She looked to Agatha, and swiftly moved in to kiss her, hot and dirty. Guiding them towards the bedroom, she stripped Agatha off her clothes and pushed her down on the bed, enjoying the way her tits bounced as she hit the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you smirking at?” Agatha questioned breathlessly, and Rio relished the way her eyes darkened as made herself bare. She climbed onto the bed, moulding their bodies together before devouring her lover’s lips in another deep kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Agatha murmured against her lips. “Rio, we need the strap.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet. I need to warm you up first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, just do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m not…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio, just get the harness…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you’re shaking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m not. I just want you to fuck me now come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed and sat up. “Okay, I veto the strap tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? No, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cupped her cheek. “Baby, you’re not ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glowered up at her. “I know when I’m ready or not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You do, but you’re also damn stubborn, woman.”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down at Agatha, who was staring off across the room. Rio wouldn’t pretend to understand why this had become such an issue, and she wished she hadn’t bought that stupid strapless strap in the first place. But that was done now. It had shifted something in Agatha, and there was no going back. The only way out was through.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought for a moment, before shifting their legs, putting one of Agatha’s on her hip before straddling Agatha’s hip with one of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her curiously. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking you without the strap,” Rio told her, before pressing their centres together.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a sharp gasp but quickly began grinding her hips upwards.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like that baby,” Rio asked as she rocked her hips, relishing the sensation of their intimate connection. “Is it good?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So fucking good,” Agatha groaned. “God, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just imagine this with a strap, babe,” Rio encouraged. “Close your eyes and picture it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned deeply and her eyes fluttered shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just think of me inside you,” Rio encouraged. “Pushing inside you over and over. Hitting parts of you no one has before. Stretching you so good your walls can’t help but suck me in deeper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s movements became erratic and Rio grinned. “Close already, babe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I need you. I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.” Rio ground her hips harder, and Agatha began to scream. “I can’t wait to be cunt deep inside you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hips shot up, her folds brushing Rio’s clit just right, making her explode along with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fell backwards, her head almost dangling off the end of the bed. She laughed as she came down from the euphoria. “You okay, babe?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer. Instead, she felt their legs untangle, then the familiar tickle of her girlfriend’s tongue between her legs. Her laughter was soon replaced by moans, and Rio ended up pulling those cute little braids out of her hair.

<div>
<p>
     Rio grumbled at the sound of Agatha’s work alarm. “Babe, turn that off.”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Agatha chuckle, before pulling away from her to do as she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pouted still. “Come back!”
    </p>
<p>
     “So needy this morning,” Agatha commented as she wrapped her arms around her again, placing soft kisses to the back of her neck. “Good morning, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled onto her back, grinning when Agatha quickly climbed on top of her. “Good morning to you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned down to kiss her. Rio was sure it was meant to be a chaste kiss, but she took her opportunity. She cupped her cheeks and deepened the kiss, hellbent on making Agatha forget she had a job. Or a life. Or a name.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few delicious moments, Agatha pulled away. “Rio, I need to go to work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to bring her back down. “Call in sick. I’ll reschedule with Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you need to get a dress for Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pouted again. “I don’t want to get up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No one is making you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you’re getting up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled off her. “I need to go to work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled. “Why can’t it be the weekend already?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust me, I’d love that,” Agatha said as she sat up. “Then that stupid gala will be over and done with too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I’m looking forward to that!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure.” Rio propped herself up on her elbows. “You’re not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hours of putting on smiles and networking. Oh yes, sounds like so much fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I meant more about us hanging out with our friends while looking all fancy, then stealing a bottle of champagne so we can take it home and fuck until morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Agatha bite her lip and the sight almost made her groan.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really enjoyed last night,” Rio told her. “You were so fucking hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blushed. “I did too. I’m just…I’m sorry for freaking out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up. “Why are you sorry? We had a good time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I wish I could just get over this fucking strap thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t care if I never wear a harness again,” Rio insisted. “I love you, I love our sex life, and I loved last night. Okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, but Rio knew her girlfriend. She wasn’t going to let this go easily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we make some breakfast?” Agatha suggested. “Start our day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned and fell back against the pillows. “It’s too early.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just have breakfast with me then you can come back to bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t. You have to go to work, which means I have to go home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t. Just stay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t like borrowing your keys all the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and got up from the bed. She moved towards the wardrobe and fished through one of the draws, before finding what she was looking for. When she turned back to Rio, she had a small black box in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened.
    </p>
<p>
     It was too big to be a ring box, though she couldn’t be sure. Whatever it was had been wrapped perfectly, with a little purple bow holding it shut. Definitely the Agatha touch.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was going to give it to you on Friday,” Agatha explained, handing her the box. “But this seems like the most opportune moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the time to study the box before carefully pulling the ribbon, allowing it to fall onto the bedsheets. She stole a glance at Agatha, who was watching her closely. Looking back to the box, she carefully lifted the lid and stared at what lay within.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a key, silver and shiny, with a little fob and the most adorable silver rabbit keychain to match.
    </p>
<p>
     She was giving her a key!
    </p>
<p>
     “Figured since you’re here more often than not.” Agatha shrugged her shoulders awkwardly. “If you’d rather wait until we have a place together, that’s fine. I just wanted to…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio surged forward and encased Agatha in a tight hug. “I love it! Thank you! Thank you!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her cheek. “No, thank
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . Really, Rio. You deserve so much more, especially for dealing with my Wanda shit recently.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, your shit is my shit,” Rio insisted, before deciding to take a gamble. “What’s mine is yours, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her cheek again. “Exactly.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, butterflies going crazy in her stomach. She was totally marrying this woman.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was always the elevator.
    </p>
<p>
     Why, whenever Agatha least expected it, did she end up stuck in an elevator alone with Wanda Maximoff?
    </p>
<p>
     She’d gotten in first. If she’d seen her in there, Agatha would have taken the stairs out of spite. But no, she’d gotten in at the garage level, while Wanda appeared as the doors opened to the lobby. And like hell she was giving her the satisfaction of getting out. So, they stood there, side by side, watching the floor numbers go up.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked her phone. Rio was meeting Alice at eleven, and said she would stay at the apartment until then. She imagined Rio pottering around her home, hanging out with Senõr Scratchy, making herself at home. The thought made her smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s things with Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smiled soured into a glare. “None of your business.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is my business,” Wanda argued. “Seeing as she’s stolen the love of my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not the love of your life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you are,” Wanda insisted. “I made a mistake, I admit that…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sleeping with your ex-husband and getting pregnant with twins is a
     <em>
      mistake
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stared at the closed doors in front of them. “He’s leaving.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Vis. He’s going back to England. He loves the boys, but he doesn’t have a life here anymore. He’ll see them during holidays and they’ll video call, but that’s it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you left me for a guy who happily abandons his family?” Agatha questioned, earning a look of hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Enjoying twisting the knife?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Agatha answered, before sighing. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her feelings for Wanda were one thing, but it was the boys that would suffer, and she had no ill-will against them. None at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t enjoy any of this, Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me neither,” Wanda admitted. “I wish they were yours. The boys, I mean. At least then I’d still have a part of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chose not to respond.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted kids. She’d always wanted kids, even when her life was shitty. She used to babysit for a couple down the street when she was younger and would love it. Susan was gearing up for middle school, but Johnny was still little. She loved looking after them both, playing games and watching movies. Even on the chaotic nights when Johnny threw up or Susan would cry over jealous girls picking on her at school, she was always sad to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     In adulthood, she hoped to have at least one, but the chances got slimmer and slimmer as the years went by. Then came Rio, and there was suddenly hope. She could almost see them. With Rio’s smile and her brown hair, stood adorably with a rabbit plushie in their little hands. The most beautiful thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s boys weren’t hers. They were never meant to be.
    </p>
<p>
     The doors opened at her floor and Agatha stepped out without saying another word. She could feel Wanda’s eyes on her as she walked away, but didn’t look back.
    </p>
<p>
     She walked into her office after a quick hello to Sharon and dumped her bag on her desk before dropping into her chair. Stretching her legs out, she leaned back and closed her eyes. She was wishing the day away already.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard a light knock at the door and groaned, sitting upright. “Come in.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Sharon shuffled in, she smiled. “Oh good. I thought it was Mike coming to nag at me again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon didn’t say anything, just sat down opposite her, a nervous expression on her face. The smile faded from Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon, is everything okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Sharon looked down at her hands in her lap. “I have to tell you something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you found another job? Because I can offer double!”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no,” Sharon insisted. “You’re not getting rid of me that easily.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha relaxed a little. “Then what’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon looked up at her nervously. “I’ve met someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A woman.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s…it’s Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “OH?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon stared at her for a moment. “You already knew, didn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a guilty smile. “I did, sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon stared at her in shock. “How?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I know everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did Lilia tell Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But Rio knows?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I told her,” Agatha lied. “We don’t keep secrets.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon looked to her nervously once more. “So, what do you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do I think? I think it’s great. I’m happy for you both.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but do you think it’s…am I okay to…am I too old to do this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Too old?” Agatha frowned. “To date?”
    </p>
<p>
     “To realise I’m, what’s the word? Bisexual?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I don’t see the problem.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My kids aren’t like you,” Sharon commented. “I wish they were.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded. “They inherited their fathers…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Selfishness?” Agatha offered. “Adulterousness?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Narrow-mindedness,” Sharon concluded. “They don’t have a heart like yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have a heart, just a swinging brick,” Agatha joked, only to be met with something she wasn’t sure existed: Sharon’s angry expression.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please don’t talk about yourself like that. I won’t hear of it. You, Agatha Harkness, are a wonderful person who took a chance on a woman who thought her life was over. You gave me back my life in ways I never thought possible. I’m sure your mother is proud to have a daughter like you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not,” Agatha concluded. “But thank you for saying that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded and got to her feet. “You could have warned me though. I never knew how long sex could go on for!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a bark of laughter. “You have no idea. So, how are you finding it? Very different from what you’re used to, I’m guessing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded, her cheeks flushed. “I’m still getting to grips with it all, but Lilia is a good teacher.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “Oh, I can imagine. My best piece of advice is once you find the spot, and you’ll know it when you do, fucking go for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll keep that in mind.” Sharon nodded in acknowledgement, before heading back to the door. “Would you like a coffee?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d love one,” Agatha replied with a grin. “And Sharon?”
    </p>
<p>
     Her assistant stopped to face her. “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Make sure Lilia leaves her cards at home on Friday. It’s not a psychic night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Easier said than done,” Sharon admitted, “but I’ll try.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her leave and laughed to herself as soon as the door was closed. She couldn’t wait to tell Rio about it later.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t happy. Nor was Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     It appears not only had Agatha and Jen made them an appointment to have exclusive access to the store’s most coveted collections, but they had set up a tab to buy whatever they wanted. AND arranged champagne in the dressing room while they tried on their selections.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do I feel like Cinderella?” Alice asked as they sat, her in an orange dress and Rio in a green one, sipping champagne flutes. “I hate this dressing up shit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like the look of that suit jacket you picked out,” Rio noted. “With the chains.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I like that red dress,” Alice offered in return. “Red suits you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “Maybe, but I want to look good next to Agatha, and red isn’t very neutral.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what are you going to do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I still have a dress to try,” Rio looked back to the dressing room. “I’ll see what that looks like.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you should get the red one anyway. It looks too good to lose.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, there is a reason why there are no price tags on these things. We can’t afford them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice swiped Rio’s phone off the chair arm, and Rio watched her put in the passcode.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice angled the screen so she couldn’t see and typed away with a mischievous grin. When she handed it back, Rio assessed the damage, which happened to be a text to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I have found two dresses I like but can’t decide.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Why the fuck did you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I think Agatha will appreciate that dress a lot more than I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared at her and was about to text Agatha to explain when a reply came through.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Put both on my tab
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio showed Alice the screen. “Now see what you’ve done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes and finished the last of her champagne. “I’m going to try that jacket on again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scowled at her as she headed back behind her curtain. She walked towards her own, typing as she went.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That was Alice. I don’t need two dresses
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Buy both and I’ll take you somewhere fancy to break in the other one.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha no…
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Honey it’s my money and I like to spend it on you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond and focused on trying on the last dress. This one wasn’t dissimilar to the red one, yet this one was black and had a single shoulder strap. She had hoped to not like it as much, or perhaps more, yet they were both equally good choices. Better than good. She had never looked so good in dresses before, only to find two in one day.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she sent Agatha another text.
    </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’m not a quitter, Rio. When we get back from Jen’s, you and I have unfinished business.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Are you sure?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I am. Definitely this time.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay, but if you can’t, I told you I don’t care.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      So you don’t want to fuck me until I scream?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip even harder as her cheeks began to burn.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I never said that!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That’s settled then.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice’s voice brought her back to attention. “Well, how does it look?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back the curtain and gave her a little twirl. Except Alice wasn’t looking at the dress.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are your cheeks so red?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” Rio huffed, the blush burning even hotter. “I’m getting both dresses.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. “Say no more.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her another glare before admiring herself in the mirror, this time with renewed confidence. She couldn’t wait for Agatha to see her in it on Friday. And she couldn’t wait to see Agatha in nothing that night.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen took her tapas nights very seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     She had done the entire time Agatha had known her, yet they had become less and less frequent as the years went on. Most due to Jen’s hostzilla tendencies making everyone conveniently make other plans whenever they were invited.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha always went. She was an asshole, but not that much of an asshole.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, as she approached Jen’s apartment door, she was a little worried about what she would be met with inside. Rio would be fine. She would laugh, and if Jen was cruel, she’d just come to her for a cuddle and all would be good again. No, it was Alice she was concerned for. More specifically, Alice and Jen’s relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     Because there was Jen and there was Tapas Jen. One was Regina George; the other was Gordon Ramsey.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet as she knocked on Jen’s front door, she could hear no shouting or crying. That only made her even more nervous. The door opened and she was greeted with Jen…smiling?
    </p>
<p>
     “There you are! Rio said you left work ages ago!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry,” she said as she cautiously stepped inside. “Traffic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes travelled round Jen’s apartment, the immaculate interior now covered in fairy lights gold balloons. Her usually fine dining table had also had a makeover, now covered in a floral tablecloth and servettes folded into swans. Agatha wondered if she’d stepped into an alternate universe.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s tapas night with a twist,” Jen explained with a grin. “I’ve made some tasty dishes, and I’ve ordered some pizzas too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your apartment looks different.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Alice and Rio came over and we dressed the place up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ah. That explained it.
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened to Jen’s room and Alice walked out, Rio in toe. “Babe, where’s your Bluetooth speaker?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shrugged. “Just use the Alexa.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we want to hook up Rio’s playlist!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you tried the bathroom?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice clicked her fingers and rushed off, but this time Rio didn’t follow. Instead, she approached Agatha with a soft smile. Wordlessly, she wrapped her arms around her neck and kissed her softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled against her lips. “Hello, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, brown eyes big and glistening. “I missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I missed you too.” Agatha placed a quick peck to her lips. “Where are your dresses?”
    </p>
<p>
     “At my apartment,” Rio answered. “If I can’t see yours, you can’t see mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I can’t wait for this surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen cleared her throat. “You two are being gross and I have food in the oven, so…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and reluctantly stepped back from Rio. “I’ll remember this next time you and Alice are snuggling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s snuggling then there’s that,” Jen argued. “You were practically fucking in my living room.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed while Agatha rolled her eyes. “Jen, if we were fucking, you’d know it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we’re not exactly quiet,” Rio added. “Quite the opposite.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen made a sound of disgust just as Alice skipped through with the speaker.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio made a playlist of every song Mom ever performed, even the ones where she’s guest vocals or uncredited!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It took a lot of research, but I did it,” Rio said with a triumphant grin. “The Lorna Wu masterplaylist!”
    </p>
<p>
     The opening chords to the Ballad of the Witches’ Road began to play as Jen’s intercom buzzed.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll be the pizza!” she announced, and the Wu-Gulliver-Vidal sisters jumped to attention.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll get it,” Alice announced. “Be right back, babe!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, sweetie,” Jen replied as she headed back to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked to Rio, smirked at the wink she received as her girlfriend followed Alice out the door. She made her way to the kitchen, and Jen handed her the salad bowl.
    </p>
<p>
     “Put some dressing on that will you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Following her instructions, she dressed and tossed the salad, before placing it on the dining table. When she returned, Jen was platting up some meatballs, humming the Witches’ Road as she worked. Agatha couldn’t help but stare. She couldn’t believe it.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked to her and frowned. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve gone soft!”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gasped. “I have not!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have. You’re soft for Alice, and that’s made you an all round big old softie softerson.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen scoffed. “Look who’s talking! You’re such a bottom at the moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you! Rio this, Rio that. I swear you guys get worse the longer you’re together. And don’t get me started on the strap situation. When you finally do it, you’re going to be insufferable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms. “How do you know we haven’t done it already?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” Jen scoffed. “You’re still looking at Rio like you’re going to combust.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m-”
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened, and Alice appeared, followed by Rio and the pizza.
    </p>
<p>
     “Delivery for Jen Kale and her hot best friend,” Rio said as she placed the pizza on the kitchen counter, before picking up the pile of plates beside it. “Allow me to help set the table, m’ladies.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but giggle, earning a smug look from Jen, who then leaned over to whisper in her ear. “Soft as fuck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Elbowing her best friend in the side, she went to help her girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     After dinner, Alice insisted they all sit in the living area before rushing off into Jen’s room. Agatha and Rio sat side by side on the couch while Jen perched in her armchair, a smug smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha eyed her suspiciously. Something was going on.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice returned with a gift bag and placed it on the coffee table before them. “It’s a joint gift.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded to Rio, who picked up the bag and peaked inside with a frown. “A frame?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but its more what’s in it,” Alice insisted with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen chuckled. “They know that, sweetie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled the frame out and examined the photo within it. Agatha watched her frown deepen before something clicked, and her eyes went wide. “No way!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Way!” Alice clapped her hands excitedly. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw it!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned over to get a look at what all the fuss was about, only to find herself in an equal state of shock. “Holy shit!”
    </p>
<p>
     There, in black and white, was Lorna Wu. Mid performance, with the camera man capturing her from behind, showing the crowd before her. Yet in that sea of faces, a small portion of the crowd was in the camera’s focus. And right there at the barricade was her and Rebecca.
    </p>
<p>
     Rebecca looked so young, while Agatha was surprised by how old she seemed. Maybe it was the clothes, or the lighting, or the fact she’d lived through a lifetime of hardship before she got to that point. Still, she was smiling, watching her future mother-in-law perform without even knowing it.
    </p>
<p>
     “How?” she asked, looking between the two sisters, however it was Jen who answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice has all the old tour photography. We were looking through the collection from that show to see if there was a crowd shot we could see you in, but we didn’t expect this!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clutched the frame, tears forming in her eyes. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smiled, tears forming in her own eyes. “I know they’re happy for us, and proud.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her arm around Rio, placing a kiss to her cheek. She knew all three of Rio’s parents would be proud of their daughter, the same was she was proud to call her the love of her life. And she was happy she had this. Happy they had this. She couldn’t wait to have this in their home, amongst their family photos, and being able to explain the story to their child one day, so they too could connect with their story.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved Rio Vidal so much, and she was ready to give her all she could give.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio clutched the frame to her chest as she followed Agatha into her apartment. Her new prized possession. A physical part of their invisible string. Agatha and her mom. She would treasure it always.
    </p>
<p>
     For the night, she placed it on one of Agatha’s bookshelves, a safe distance from Senõr Scratchy. She stepped back to look at it, imagining it in their future home surrounded by pictures of Alice and Jen, and the Kaplans, and Lilia, and their future baby whoever they may be. Perfect.
    </p>
<p>
     More perfect than she ever thought she’d have. More perfect than she deserved.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s arms wrapped around her waist, hugging her front behind. “You okay, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back into her. “I’m amazing.”
     <br/>
     “Yes, you are.” Agatha placed a kiss to her neck. “Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     She allowed Agatha to lead her to the bedroom. The Chanel box was quickly pulled out from under the bed, but then Agatha produced something else. A little gift bag of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m getting spoilt tonight,” Rio said with a grin. A grin that fell when she looked in the bag.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope it’s okay,” Agatha said. “I wasn’t sure what kind you liked to wear.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled out the green harness, examining it closely. “It’s more than okay. How much did this cost you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Not much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re hellbent on spoiling me today, aren’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You?” Agatha questioned. “No, they’re all for me. You’re just doing the modelling.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio held the harness up. “Want me to model this now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s confidence instantly disappeared. She bit her lip and nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pick what you want me to use then,” Rio prompted, smirked when Agatha threw the lid off the Chanel box and pulled out a green toy. Not their largest but bigger than what she thought she’d choose.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t comment, just stripped off her clothes and adjusted the harness on her hips with the toy jutting out. Agatha sat on the bed in front of her, still fully clothed, the only thing gone being her blazer that had been thrown somewhere across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood over her, watching as Agatha bit her lip again, this time with hints of a smile. She looked so fucking good. It took everything in her not to dive right in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s attention dipped lower, and Rio’s gaze followed. She smirked when she realized what she was looking at. She hooked her finger under Agatha’s chin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at me, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed Agatha’s head back up, and this time the smile was gone, her mouth slightly open, blue eyes near black.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never been so turned on in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back. “Take your clothes off and lie on the bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, and for a moment Rio thought she’d pushed too far. Then, her girlfriend stood, and slowly peeled off her clothes, down to the bra that popped off with ease, and her panties. Noticeably soaked, they slid down her legs so fast Rio was sure it was a new world record.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Agatha was on the bed, she couldn’t hold back. Rio climbed over her, placing a hand beside Agatha’s head to hold herself up. She stared down into those lustful eyes, marvelling at the desire burning in her irises, but she still had to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want this, Agatha? Truly?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, her hand reaching down to wrap around the strap. “I want you. All of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up, pushing Agatha’s hand away. Her hand slid between her lover’s thighs and stroked through her soak folds.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned and tipped her head back. “Don’t tease, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked and slowly slid a finger inside, then another, pumping them in and out until she was sure she was ready. She relished Agatha’s whine when she pulled out, but she had a job to do.
    </p>
<p>
     Leaning over to the bedside table, she grabbed the bottle of lube Agatha was so fond of and stroked the thick liquid over the silicone shaft.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared down at Agatha. The woman was a vision. Breathless, flushed and wide open for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost came on the spot.
    </p>
<p>
     She got herself into position, the tip of the shaft at Agatha’s entrance. “Tell me when.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a deep breath before nodding. “When.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slid inside. Slowly. Carefully. Pushing until Agatha’s eyes widened.
    </p>
<p>
     She stilled, carefully moving strands of hair from her love’s face. “You okay, baby?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Keep going.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back before pushing back in again, further this time. Agatha groaned.
    </p>
<p>
     “More.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kept her eyes fixed on her face as she thrust again, this time to the hilt. Agatha’s legs shot up, wrapping around her waist while her fingers dug deep into her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” she said shakily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asked again, starting to panic. “Just relax so I can pull out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “NO, no, no. Please stay, please I’m so close.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. Already?
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed there for a while, joined and still, Agatha’s eyes closed while Rio mapped every micro-expression in her face.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha canted her hips upwards, she began to move. Slow at first, getting Agatha used to the sensation, but her moans were so sinful, and Rio was getting close too.
    </p>
<p>
     She picked up the face, and Agatha gasped louder than a scream.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Rio. That feels so fucking good.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It does?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, give it to me. Give me everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s pace picked up even more, until she was practically slamming into her. Over and over, the sound so dirty she had to try ignore it as not to come on the spot. She reached down, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s clit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!” Agatha’s hips thrust up against her, fast and frantic, and Rio was struggling to keep up.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so close. So fucking close.  But she couldn’t come yet. She needed to see Agatha come apart on her. Needed to see her through it.
    </p>
<p>
     Two more thrusts and Agatha screamed, her hand flying back to press her palm against the headboard.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right there, right there. Oh FUCK.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s back arched and Rio couldn’t help herself. Her lips latched on to her left nipple, and then Agatha was shaking under her. She fucked her through it, teasing her breast as she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand clutched the back of her head, her hips still kicking up against her. That was enough to keep Rio going. She chased her own release, pounding into her over and over, pulling away from Agatha’s grasp to tip her head up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so good at this, Rio,” Agatha gasped. “So good. So good to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So good to you,” Rio said breathlessly. “Love you. Love you so much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha said, before moaning loudly. “I’m close again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come with me,” Rio pleaded. “Come with me, Agatha. Please, come, come-”
    </p>
<p>
     White hot pleasure ran through her. Her hips slamming forward and through her haze she heard a euphoric cry, the legs around her waist squeezing as wetness washed over her thighs.
     <br/>
     Rio fell forward, her head resting in the crook of Agatha’s neck. They both lay there, catching their breaths as the last shots of pleasure coursed to their nerve endings.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was amazing.” She kissed Agatha’s neck. “I’ve never come like that wearing a strap before.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t reply, and it was then Rio realized she was still squeezing her hips, still clawing at her back. Then she heard the first sob into her shoulder. Quiet at first, until Agatha’s body shook uncontrollably as she cried into her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her pleasure was quickly replaced with panic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Agatha sniffle, the clawing hands now holding her tight.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” she said through her sobs. “I love you so much, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed a kiss to the side of her head and held her as she cried. “I love you too. More than I can ever say.”

<p>
     Agatha couldn’t sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared up at the ceiling while Rio slept deeply beside her. A glance at her clock told her she would have to get up in an hour or so. Ready for another day at work. An ordinary day. But it wasn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     No, Agatha felt like something inside her had been forever changed that night.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had held her as she cried, then helped her up for a shower before they returned to snuggle in bed. Agatha had fallen asleep for a while, but when she next opened her eyes, little time had passed, and she was unable to drift back under.
    </p>
<p>
     She considered getting up and going to read on the couch, but she knew Rio liked her there when she woke up. So, she stayed, staring up at the ceiling, waiting for her alarm to ring. Then, she would put on a smile and pretend everything was fine.
    </p>
<p>
     And it was, in a way. Just different. She had let Rio in, literally and figuratively. Closer than she’d ever let anyone ever before, too scared they would hurt her like she had been hurt by the one person who was meant to love her unconditionally.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought back to the photo currently on her bookcase. If she ever found a photo of Rio near her mother, she was rip it in two to keep them apart. Rio’s tragedy was death, hers was pain. Two different cuts that ran just as deep, but while Rio could love so openly, she had struggled. Until last night. Now she was open wide.
    </p>
<p>
     There was movement beside her, and when she looked, she was met with big brown eyes, glistening in the darkness.
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe, you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Agatha insisted. “Just can’t sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shuffled closer. “What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just wired, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this about the strap or the crying?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s about you being stupidly good at
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     and now I’m a mess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Regret not trying it sooner?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed a kiss to the top of her head. “Not one bit. We didn’t just have sex night, Rio. It felt like…I feel different. Like I’ve let go of something. Something I’ve held on to for too long and maybe I’ll only let it go when I’m with you but…I don’t know what I’m trying to say.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I do,” Rio assured. “And I agree. I mean I we’ve made love a couple of times, but that was like…soul-soldering.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Soul-soldering?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, like our souls were soldered together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought about it for a moment before sighing. “Dammit that’s actually good”.
    </p>
<p>
     “Feel free to use it, sweetheart.” Rio placed a kiss to her neck. “And use me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s inner conflict was replaced with sheering desire. She leaned down and kissed Rio deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Rio asked against her lips. “Want me to strap up again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned at the thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt Rio smirk. “Be right back, babe.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raced to the bathroom and emerged a few moments later, her sleep shirt still on but she had replaced Agatha’s boxers with her new accessory.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes latched onto the silicone shaft and quickly reached down to pull her panties down, kicking them off somewhere at the end of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio climbed under the sheets and hovered over her. Lubing up, she pressed the shaft up against her, and Agatha couldn’t help but bite her lip in anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it when you do that,” Rio said. “Almost as I love it when you do this.”
    </p>
<p>
     The shaft pushed inside her, and Agatha gasped.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio buried her face into her neck and started thrusting into her. She placed a kiss to her neck that lasted dangerously long.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled at the back of her shirt. “Rio V-Vidal, you better not, oh fuck, give me a hickey before-oh fuck me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Working on it,” Rio said against her skin. “And don’t worry. No one gets to see how fucked you are besides me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dug her fingers into her back again. She had always thought it was the stretch and depth that made people crazy for the strap, because otherwise what difference would it make from fingers? As it turned out, hips moved differently to fingers. They pushed and pulled and swirled and snapped and
     <em>
      fuck!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio thrust slow and deep, grinding her hips into her with purpose.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.” One of her hands moved up to stroke Rio’s hair. “I can’t believe we didn’t do this sooner, though I’m planning to make up for lost time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed against her neck. “If you’re making full sentences, I’m doing this wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio sat up, still inside her, and pulled Agatha’s legs up to her waist. The angle changed and the shaft pressed against a new spot.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped, gasps that turned into screams when Rio thrust into her hard and fast.
    </p>
<p>
     “You like that,” Rio asked, her voice raspy and breathless. “You like it when I fuck you like this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     She thrust harder and Agatha clawed at whatever she could. The bedsheets, the pillows, Rio’s forearms. Anything to keep her from being carried away by the flood of pleasure growing between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Answer my question, Agatha,” Rio pressed. “Tell me who you belong to.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You,” Agatha insisted. “Always you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You love me so much,” Rio said. “Spoiling me all the time. Now I’m going to
     <em>
      ruin
     </em>
     you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then she hooked a hand under her knee, pulling it harder. The tip of the shaft hit her most sensitive spot over and over, until Agatha found herself swept away.
    </p>
<p>
     Still lost and shaking from her orgasm, she could feel Rio thrust into her a few more times before pressing deep with a long groan, inciting another wave of pleasure from her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fell against her, catching her breath. “Fuck, babe. You were so good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Still in her hazy post-orgasm state, Agatha laughed to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re like a different person when you’re on top. More like, well, me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Learned from the best,” Rio grinned. “I’m going to get a shower. Come join me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Give me a moment and I’ll meet you in there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed a kiss to her lips before getting off the bed. She pulled her shirt off as she went, revealing the red scratches littering her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped. “Shit Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned round. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so sorry!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your back!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” Rio moved to the mirror and twisted herself to get a look. “Yeah, I know. I think my dress will cover it though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I don’t care.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. Of course she didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Rio got her attention again. “You know I’d tell you if I didn’t like this, and I do like it. Like, a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Reminds me I made you feel so good you lost control.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. She had lost control, totally and gladly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio unbuckled the harness, pulling out the shaft and carrying it to the bathroom. She turned back in the doorway and beckoned her to follow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was up in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By midday, Rio was sat in her living room, flicking through the TV channels.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you have work to do?” Lilia asked from the kitchen. “You know, for that degree you’re so masterfully neglecting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did some this morning at Agatha’s.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned away from her. “You’re there most of the time now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I’m here during the day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You won’t be now you have that key.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the set of keys resting beside her on the chair arm, the key for her own apartment now added to the set. One of the many gifts she had received the day before, each equally as special.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll still be here, Lilia. It's just because Agatha gets up ridiculously early.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but I miss you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re just as busy as me,” Rio reminded her. “Don’t tell me you don’t spend all your time with Sharon these days.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned to face her. “Agatha told you, didn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just laughed. “Am I wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but...oh whatever. We’ll get to hang out on Friday, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Oh yeah, I can’t wait!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we all going together? Sharon is getting ready here, and I’m assuming Agatha will be bringing a car?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. I’ll ask her.”
    </p>
<p>
     She checked her phone, only to see a message from said beautiful lady pop up.

</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’m on my way. Put it on and lie on the bed for me.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio jumped to attention. She needed to hide her dresses. She needed to find her shoebox, but she also needed....
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia, can you open the door to Agatha when she gets here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but why can’t...”
    </p>
<p>
     “And can I put my new dresses in your room? I don’t want her to see.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, but Rio...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, Lilia. I owe you one!” Rio rushed into her room and grabbed the two garment bags hung up on the front of her wardrobe. She carefully carried them through to Lilia’s room and lay them carefully on the bed before returning to her own room.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid off her pants and changed into her best vest top that made her boobs look amazing. Reaching under her bed, she found her shoebox. It wasn’t as extravagant as Agatha’s, nor did it have as adventurous content, but it would do.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was strapped up, Rio laid out on the bed, ready and waiting, her bottle of lube ready on the bed beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Time moved slow, but eventually she heard Lilia’s voice, then the unmissable hum of Agatha’s. Her anticipation grew as the clicking of heels got closer and closer, until the bedroom door opened, and Agatha slipped inside.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled as she shut the door behind her, dropping her back down in front of it. “You look gorgeous, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled back at her. “So do you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was wearing a dress suit that day, one that made her ass look amazing. She shrugged off the jacket, but kept on the rest, rolling her skirt up above her lips, before pushing her panties down, kicking them off somewhere on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t care about the mess. She was just mesmerized by the woman climbing on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swung her leg over her thighs so she was straddling her, the shaft jutting up against her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     “We getting right to it?” Rio asked, knowing the answer already.
    </p>
<p>
     “I only have an hour.” Agatha checked her watch. “No, fifty-eight minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We best get a move on then.” Rio grabbed the bottle of lube and held it out to her. “Want to do the honours?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squirted the liquid into her hand before rubbing it over the shaft. She bit that fucking lip again, and Rio wanted to shoot up and bite it herself.
    </p>
<p>
     When the shaft was ready, Agatha sat up, positioning the tip between her folds. She stayed like that for a while, looking down at the shaft with hesitance.
    </p>
<p>
     “You sure about this?” Rio asked, moving her hands to stroke her sides. “I can get on top.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha instantly shook her head. “You stay right there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha sunk down. All the way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe, Lilia is outside.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t care.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went to argue, but then Agatha lifted herself up only to slide back down the shaft, groaning as she went.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio didn’t care either.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha set a steady rhythm, and Rio watched her face for any sign of displeasure. When she saw her frown with frustration, she grasped her sides and moved her hips forward a little, keeping hold as she thrust up into her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned and tipped back her head. “Oh fuck! Rio, I’m close, I’m so fucking close. I can’t, I can’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can!” Rio insisted. “Baby, just come for me!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s thighs locked around her, and Rio stared in awe at the shaking body above her, relishing the long moan of pleasure before she flopped forward on top of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nestled her face into Agatha’s hair, savouring the feel, the smell. She was addicted to everything about her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she caught her bearings, Agatha sat up and slowly slid off the shaft, before landing back beside her. She looked to Rio, her pupils still wide. “Did you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but I’m okay. Seeing you like that was just...wow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and traced her finger down Rio’s nose. “I love your face.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit back a laugh. Had she literally fucked Agatha silly?
    </p>
<p>
     “I love your face.” Rio traced her nose in return. “Especially this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I know how much you love my nose. Especially when it’s between your legs.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love it in general. It’s powerful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up to look at her. “You think I have a powerful nose?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s the kind of nose Greek sculptors would give their Gods. Like Aphrodite. No, Athena. Wait, no, Hecate.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “Dork.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Geek.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back down, hovering above her, their lips inches apart. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too.” Rio leaned up, kissing her sweetly. “How long can you stay for?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat back up and checked her watch. “I have to leave here in half an hour.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Want a picnic in bed?”
    </p>
<p>
     “In bed?” Agatha questioned. “Where we’ve just had sex?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’ll see what we have.” Rio got up and unclipped the harness, kicking it across the room and finding a pair of shorts. She grabbed the robe from the back of her desk chair and shrugged it on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Agatha looked her up and down. “A
     <em>
      Minecraft
     </em>
     robe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? It’s cute!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Whatever you say, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved towards the door, before stopping. “Oh, and Lilia wanted to know if her and Sharon are going in the car to the gala with us?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Might as well,” Agatha answered. “Jen and Alice are meeting us there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cool. I’ll let her know.”
    </p>
<p>
     When she walked out, she spotted Lilia at the dining table, shuffling her cards. She shot Rio a disapproving look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Could have at least tried to keep it down.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked to herself as she headed to the kitchen. “Can we have the left-over pizza?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Lilia answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh and Agatha said we’ll all go in the same car tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as you don’t have another sex show in the back seat.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry Lilia,” Agatha shouted from the bedroom. “That’s the plan for the way home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia hid her head in her hands. “I hate you both.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cackled as she carried the pizza through to her room. Revenge had never been so sweet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat at her desk, contemplating, well, everything.
    </p>
<p>
     It was ridiculous. She’d had sex with Rio twice already that day, yet she wasn’t satisfied. Well, her body was (for now), but her mind? Not so much.
    </p>
<p>
     She had an idea though. Or rather a fantasy. It had crept up on her during a zoom meeting and she’d spent most of it trying to stop herself from biting her lip. It was sinful, too naughty even for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet she wanted to do it.
    </p>
<p>
     So she did.
    </p>
<p>
     She picked up her phone and sent Rio a message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>

</p>
<p>
<em>
      Need to stay at work. Come keep me company?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The reply came quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      On my way!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned wickedly. Now she had to get ready.
    </p>
<p>
     She struck her head out of her office door and smiled at Sharon. “Want to head home? I’m staying late tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon checked her watch. “It’s already six! Won’t Rio be missing you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s coming here,” she answered. “We’ll head out together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon began to gather her things. “Well make sure you two are home and settled, otherwise you’ll be yawning all through the gala like you have most of the afternoon!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to admit that she was tired, her night without sleep catching up to her. Hence why she was doing so reckless. “I’ll make sure I get plenty of sleep, I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched Sharon head out, and suddenly the floor was quiet. There were people upstairs still, Mike, and she could imagine Wanda was up there somewhere. Agatha didn’t care. Instead, she headed back to her office and cleared her desk of anything breakable, making sure her photographs of Billy were locked away in a draw.
    </p>
<p>
     After that, it was a waiting game. She moved to the windows, staring out at the city as the sun began to set. She didn’t switch on any of the lights, instead allowing the sharp orange glow to fill the office, the shadows sharpening as it faded into deep purple.
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost dark when she heard someone on the floor. She prayed it wasn’t a cleaner, or an intern, but when she heard rushing footsteps approaching her office, she knew exactly who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     The door to her office opened and Rio walked in. “Hey Babe. Why’s it so dark in here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was watching the sunset.” She walked across the office and Rio went to meet her. Agatha smirked and walked right by her to the door. “Can I lock it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, but I thought you were working?” Rio looked around. “Where’s all your stuff gone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for the lock. “I put it all away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the lock clicked, she kickstarted her plan into action.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pull down you pants and bend over the desk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared back at her, eyes wide. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pull down your pants and bend over the desk, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     She relished the sight of her girlfriend’s shock, but much more enjoyed watching her do as she asked. Soon, her bare ass was in the air, her upper body laid out on the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked and walked up behind her. She swatted her ass lightly, earning a surprised yelp.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned down to whisper in her ear. “I wanted to thank you for earlier.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wha-oh!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, her middle and ring finger all the way inside her. She pumped them in and out experimentally, enjoying the groan they dragged from Rio’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to be quiet, my love,” she whispered in her ear again as she set a punishing rhythm. “Anyone could hear us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned. “I can’t stay quiet. Not when you’re doing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nipped her ear. “Guess I’ll have to shut you up then.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stuck a third finger in, and Rio screamed. “FUCK.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shh.” Agatha licked along the curve of her ear as she shoved her fingers deep inside her, over and over. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” Rio gasped. “I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha adjusted her hand so her thumb rubbed her clit with every stroke. “Come on, my love. Be a good girl and come all over my desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!” Rio’s legs buckled and Agatha caught her hip, making sure she didn’t fall. She held her through the waves, enjoying the way she squeezed her fingers in sharp pulses.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the shocks passed, Rio slumped against the desk, her cheek flat against the glass, and Agatha hoped it left an imprint. Something she could look at in the morning and remind her of what she’d just done.
    </p>
<p>
     Sliding her fingers out of her, Agatha picked Rio up of the desk, turning her round to sit her on the edge of the desk. She brought her wet fingers up to her mouth, making a show of cleaning them thoroughly. Then, she simply smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we pick up dinner on the way home?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared back at her, her chest still heaving with her eyes still wide like a startled Bambi. “You’re fucking crazy, and I love you.”

<p>
     It was gala day, and the offices of Darkhold Publishing were buzzing with excitement. Assistants ran around organising cars and chasing up RSVPs, while interns fetched drycleaning and raced around trying to meet every request from their fastidious bosses.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, however, perched on the edge of Sharon’s desk, eating a cookie. She was all set for the night ahead and so found the chaos most entertaining.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do they leave everything so last minute?” Sharon questioned. “I booked all your appointments in weeks ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because they’re imbeciles,” Agatha answered. “Why have one good idea when you can have two bad ones?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well at least we were prepared. What time are you leaving?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My hair appointment is at two,” Agatha answered. “Where are you going?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Straight to Lilia’s,” Sharon answered. “Her friend is a hair stylist, so she’s doing all our hair.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Even Rio’s?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio said she’d do it herself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. Of course she did.
    </p>
<p>
     She went to pick up another cookie when a familiar shade of red appeared in the corner of her eye. Agatha looked to see Wanda approaching, a smile plastered on her face, but she knew her ex well enough to know it was fake. She could also see the nervousness in her eyes, something she hadn’t seen in a long time.
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped in front of them, her hands clasped in front of her. “Hello Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon dived for the phone. “I’m calling security!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon, wait,” Agatha held up a hand to stop her. “What is it, Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I-I want to apologise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded. “I had a chat with a friend last night, and she made me realise how inappropriate I’ve been. I know you’re with Rio, and while I don’t understand why you would lower yourself to a student…”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      PhD
     </em>
     student,” Agatha specified. “Nearly a doctor in her field of science. And I’m not lowering myself at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda held up her hands. “I’m sorry. I didn’t come to start more drama. I came to ask for a truce. At least until after the gala. We have some important investors coming, and we want to show a united front.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We? As in you and Mike?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shrugged. “Look, it’s one night. We’ll probably barely see each other, but can we at least pretend to be professional?”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you quit with the weird shit, I don’t see it being a problem.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Very good.” Wanda began to step back. “I look forward to seeing you there. I’m guessing you’re going with Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I am.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda hummed. “Let’s hope that goes well, then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her go, a confused frown set on her face. She looked to Sharon, who shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m new to this gay thing, but I think she still likes you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a smile before heading back to office. She had some work to do before she could begin her own gala preparations.
    </p>
<p>
     It was set to be an interesting night.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the page in front of her. She read the last line over and over, committing it to memory.
    </p>
<p>
     She had finished it. The Witches’ Road. The book Agatha never got published. And it was a masterpiece.
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, she may be a little bias, but it was good. Stupidly good. So good she wanted to show anyone and everyone. It would be a bestseller. A modern classic. A piece that would be studied as a prime example of brilliant literature.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, she was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     giving Agatha one hell of an ego boost later.
    </p>
<p>
     She sent Alice a message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I just finished Agatha’s book and it’s amazing!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She set her phone aside and walked through to the living room, where Sharon sat on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Lilia?” Rio asked, looking around for her roommate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her and her friend are washing her hair for styling,” Sharon answered, pointing to the bathroom door. Rio heard Lilia’s sharp laugh filter from the ajar door and shook her head. It was a good think she’d already washed hers, otherwise there would be no way she’d be ready on time.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Sharon answered. “She’s gone for her appointments.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So, no drama this morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The opposite actually,” Sharon answered. “Wanda stopped by and they’ve called a truce.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A truce?” Rio folded her arms. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only until after the gala, but it’s something.” Sharon looked to the bathroom door before sitting up. “Between you and me, I think Wanda still holds a bit of a flame for her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed bitterly. “Oh, I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you have nothing to worry about,” Sharon insisted. “The way Agatha looks at you says it all. Since the day I first saw you together, I could see that she was absolutely besotted with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked in surprise. “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     The first time Sharon had seen them had been when they weren’t even really together. When they actually hated each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded. “Her eyes sparkle when she looks at you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to cover her shock with a smile. “I better start getting ready. Got to make a good impression to my lady’s colleagues.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll be amazing,” Sharon assured. “Just be yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded before retreating back to her room.
    </p>
<p>
     What had Sharon meant? Did that mean Agatha never really hated her? Did she ever hate Agatha? Had all that, the lies and the tricks, just been because they were hurt?
    </p>
<p>
     Had they loved each other all along?
    </p>
<p>
     She picked up her phone, frowning when she saw Alice hadn’t replied. Perhaps she too was busy getting ready, right when Rio needed to speak to her most.
    </p>
<p>
     She tossed her phone on her bed and picked up Agatha’s manuscript again.  She wished she could keep it, but she knew Agatha would want it back. Though, maybe soon, there wouldn’t be a divide between ‘Agatha’s’ and ‘Rio’s’. It would just be theirs, ‘til death do they part.
    </p>
<p>
     An idea popped into Rio’s mind. A crazy, stupid idea. So stupid she shouldn’t do it, she couldn’t, but she was. She picked up a pen and did something that couldn’t be undone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared down at her work and smiled. Oh, she couldn’t wait for that night.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened her suit jacket before knocking on the door. She could hear movement within the Vidal-Calderu residence, and soon the door opened, revealing her very-glammed assistant.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you look amazing!” Sharon looked her up and down. “Wow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “Lilia really has awoken something in you, hasn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon blushed and waved her inside. “Come on, you. Your date looks like she’s about to implode.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shut the door behind her and stepped fully into the apartment. She looked round and spotted Lilia stood by Rio’s bedroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia grinned at her before looking to the door. “Rio, your prince charming is here.”
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened and Rio stepped out, a little purse in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put a hand over her heart. She had never seen such a vision in her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s dress was a simple black number, with one shoulder and a v neck, revealing a classy amount of cleavage. The dress hugged her perfectly, while dark tights covered her legs.  Agatha couldn’t wait to take them off later.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hair was up in a neat ponytail, her bangs framing her face. God, her face. Her eye make-up was dark and smoky, while her lips were a rich cherry red. She wished she could kiss it off there and then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, you look…I don’t even have the words.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes roamed over her, gleaming in delight. “And you look…I almost want to get right to the end of the night when we get into the backseat…”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia clapped her hands together. “We’ll meet you both at the car. Come on, darling.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both watched the two women rush out the apartment, waiting before the door shut behind them before laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “That was cruel.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted a moment alone with my girl, and it worked.” Rio stepped up to her, playing with the lapels of her velvet jacket. “You look so fucking hot in a suit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you look fucking
     <em>
      sinful
     </em>
     in that dress.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled, before a concerned expression appeared on her face. “Hey, have you heard from Jen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her purse and pulled out her phone. She checked the screen and frowned. “Alice just hasn’t replied to me in a few hours, that’s all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got her own phone out of her jacket and sent Jen a text.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      About to leave Rio’s. You guys good?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “There. She probably didn’t see your message. Jen can be a little fussy when getting ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess. It’s just not like her not to reply.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Agatha reached out to cup her cheek. “If something was up, Jen would have called us, okay? Don’t worry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nuzzled her hand, smiling at her sweetly. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I love you.” Agatha stroked a thumb against her cheek. “Shall we go?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hang on! I just need to grab somethings from my room.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared after her as she rushed off in her little black stilettos. If she wasn’t totally in love before, she certainly was now.
    </p>
<p>
     Her phone beeped.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’m good. Alice is being weird, but I think she’s just nervous.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Weird how?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      JEN
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Not sure. There’s just something off about her. You guys probably won’t notice though. She’s still all smiles. Like you’d know if something was up with Rio, right?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back to the night with the Wanda photo. How Rio had reacted, and how she had started saying something but backtracked. She hadn’t forgotten that.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I get it. We’ll talk in person.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She heard Rio’s heels approach and quickly put her phone back into her pocket. When her love reappeared, she was wearing a black jacket and had something else besides her purse in her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “Is that my manuscript?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is.” Rio grinned at her. “I finished it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You did?” Agatha looked at her feet. “What did you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up hopefully. “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “I did make an amendment though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, to the title page.”
    </p>
<p>
     She eyed her girlfriend curiously before taking the manuscript from her. She ran her eyes over the title page, her eyes locking onto Rio’s scrawling addition.
    </p>
<p>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the amendment in awe. Was she asking what she thought she was asking?
    </p>
<p>
     “We can discuss it more later.” Rio took the manuscript from her and placed it on the table. “Shall we go?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was incapable of speech, every nerve-ending in her body on fire. Instead, she nodded and held out her arm, grinning when her partner- perhaps almost-fiancée- took it without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     This was going to be the best night of her life.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The gala was as extravagant as Rio expected. From ice sculptures to champagne fountains, it was like stepping into another world. There were people everywhere, men in suits in deep discussions and women gathered together in fine dresses engaging excitable chatter.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked in on Agatha’s arm, feeling invincible. Her girlfriend looked so hot in that suit. The dark velvet, her hair loose and powerful. She could just melt into her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia and Sharon had gone to find her table, but Agatha had to socialize. Or her version of socializing which was faking a smile and nodding at people as they crossed paths. They circled the room a few times, and soon Rio got restless.
    </p>
<p>
     She got her phone out of her purse and checked her notifications. Alice still hadn’t replied. Had she broken her phone or something?
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Agatha spoke up. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her phone away and smiled. “Of course, though I’ll be better when I have a drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Your wish is my command.”
    </p>
<p>
     They headed to the bar and ordered two whiskeys, which they received in matching crystal glasses. As they walked away, a man stepped forward to greet them, one Rio recognized.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, glad you could make it. And am I right in assuming this is the famous Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Infamous,” Rio corrected. “And yes. You must be Mike.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am.” He looked her up and down. “You’re a lucky lady, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh I know.” Agatha pulled her closer. “Now, we best find our table.”
    </p>
<p>
     As they walked away, Agatha grumbled under her breath. “Asshole.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sleezebag,” Rio added. “How do you work with these people?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “By making them afraid of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     They found Lilia and Sharon at their table, sharing a bottle of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two don’t waste time,” Rio commented as she folded her jacket on the back of her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia held her glass up to her. “When in Rome.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled out her chair, waiting for her to sit before taking the seat next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two are such a gorgeous couple,” Sharon commented.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for her hand. “This one is the gorgeous one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio intertwined their fingers. “Then you’re the handsome one, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, before leaning in to whisper in her ear. “I can’t wait to eat you out with that dress on later before you bend me over the bed and fuck me so good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a sip of her whiskey, hoping to keep her blush under control.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are Jen and Alice?” Lilia asked. “They’ll be late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re on their way,” Agatha assured. “Jen always likes to be fashionably late.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was then Rio spotted something out of the corner of her eye. A flash of red. She looked to see Wanda, wearing a flowing scarlet gown covered in sparkles, her hair back in a bun while bangs fell in front of her forehead. She wore an obnoxiously large necklace with diamonds Rio was sure had to be as faux as the woman wearing them.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda must have sensed her watching as their quickly eyes met. She raised her glass of wine to her, and it took everything in Rio not to shoot her the bird.
    </p>
<p>
     Truce or not, she didn’t trust that bitch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah finally!” Agatha stood and walked round the table. Rio followed her gaze and saw her sister and Jen appear through the crowd. Alice wore the jacket and white shirt she’d picked out the other day, along with a pair of black pants. Jen towered over her, wearing a flowing dress in her signature pink, a bright smile on her face as she pulled away to greet Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your work is so fancy!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only when they want to be,” Agatha answered. “Most of these guys are notorious slobs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped up to Alice. “Hey, you okay? I texted you but you didn’t reply.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice stared at her, her face muted and eyes emotionless. “We need to talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s stomach dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     She stole a glance at Agatha, who was laughing at something Jen had told her. So beautiful, more than she ever deserved.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes met Alice’s again. “Not here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Alice grasped her hand and began to drag her off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?” Agatha called after her, and Rio plastered on a smile to look back at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just heading to the bathroom, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then she followed Alice, through the faceless crowd and muffled chatter towards the restrooms.
    </p>
<p>
     Here it was. The moment she had dreaded all her life, and there was no way of escaping it now.

<p>
     They found some bathrooms up on the second floor. Rio wasn’t sure if they were meant to be there, but she didn’t care. Once the door was shut behind them, she checked the stalls for any potential occupants. Satisfied they were alone, she finally faced her sister.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you read it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “How much?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” Alice held up her hand. “You can’t explain this away, Rio. I mean seriously, what the fuck?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to keep cool, even if her heart was throwing itself around in a frenzied panic. “I understand this is a shock…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shock?” Alice questioned. “Finding out my mom slept with Joan Jett was a shock! This? This is…I don’t even have the words!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why didn’t you tell me?” A tear fell down Alice’s cheek, leaving a black trail of eyeliner in its wake. “Why did none of you tell me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom and dad didn’t even want me to know,” Rio insisted. “They didn’t want it to weigh on us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you did know, and you didn’t tell me,” Alice accused. “When did you find out?
    </p>
<p>
     “When I was fifteen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Fifteen
     </em>
     ?” Alice stared at her in disbelief. “And you never once trusted me enough to tell me? Even when you knew I’d find out reading the journals.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hoped she wouldn’t have written it down,” Rio admitted. “But I do trust you, completely. I was just scared you’d never look at me the same way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you just decided not to tell me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a long time ag…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Rio! You killed your mom!”
    </p>
<p>
     There it was.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth loitered in the air between them. Rio wanted to grasp it and lock it away somewhere it would never escape. But she couldn’t. It was out there, and there was no undoing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t,” Alice stopped her. “Does Agatha know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, and please don’t tell her. Or Jen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice crossed her arms. “Just because you’re okay keeping secrets, doesn’t mean I am.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Alice.”
     </em>
     Tears stung at Rio’s eyes. “Please. I get that you’re mad, but I can’t lose Agatha. I know I did something awful, but I was a kid! I didn’t understand and I’ve been trying to make up for it my entire life. Even if you never want to see me again, please don’t make me lose her too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grabbed some tissues and reached out to dab Rio’s cheek. “You’re not losing me, but I can’t pretend this never happened. Or pretend I’m not mad as hell.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in understanding. She took the tissue and cleaned Alice’s cheek. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re not done,” Alice insisted. “We’re going to talk about this properly, but our girls are waiting for us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, and after a quick mirror check, they headed back to the others.
    </p>
<p>
     When they re-entered the dining hall, the tables were busy with dapper-dressed guests, while waiters weaving between them with flutes of champagne.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood when she saw them approach. “Did you two get lost?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We were just chatting,” Rio said dismissively, leaning in to kiss her cheek before they both sat down. “What did we miss?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not much,” Jen answered, smiling as Alice dropped into the chair next to her. “Just missing you two. Must have been one hell of a sister meeting. We thought you’d miss the first course.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked up her whiskey and downed it in one.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia whistled. “Careful. We don’t want to be dragging you out of here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her the middle finger and reached for a champagne flute from a passing waiter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure you’re okay?” Agatha asked, her beautiful face marked with concern.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put on a sweet smile. “I’m just fine, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There was something wrong with Rio. Agatha knew the moment she saw her returning through the crowd. She put on a smile, got involved in the conversation, and laughed along with their jokes, but there was something off.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought back to what Jen had said earlier. How she just knew something was wrong with Alice. Rio had been fine before she went with her sister to the bathroom, and whatever ‘sister chat’ they had changed that.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to know why.
    </p>
<p>
     They finished up their main courses, Rio having cleared her own plate, Lilia’s, Sharon’s and eaten the entire basket of breadsticks in the middle of the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where do you put it all?” Lilia teased her, but Agatha could see she knew something wasn’t right.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to the bar.” Agatha stood up. “Who wants what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A whole bottle of champagne,” Rio answered. “Each.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon and Jen unknowingly laughed, and Lilia put on a good show of joining them. Alice just smiled weakly. Agatha met her gaze with a questioning expression, and Alice quickly looked down.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, she was not having this.
    </p>
<p>
     Once everyone had given their real orders (thankfully Rio had asked for a coke), Agatha clasped her hands together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfect! Jen, mind helping me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen sighed and got to her feet. “You have a whole girlfriend for this, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her and led them through the sea of tables. Once she was sure they were out of their eyeline, she pulled her best friend aside.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, something is wrong with Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Jen frowned. “She seems fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The same was Alice seems ‘fine’?” Agatha challenged, and realisation crossed Jen’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Was she like that earlier?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean she was a bit agitated about Alice not texting her back, but then they went to bathroom and she’s…something isn’t right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen nodded in agreement. “We need to find out what. But how?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We won’t get anywhere while we’re here. We just need to keep an eye on them until we get them alone later. But if they want us to keep it to ourselves, we have to. We can’t betray their trust.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are you and what have you done with Agatha Harkness?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “But we have to let the other know if it’s serious or not, or if we need to intervene. That way at least we have some clarity.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen nodded. “We just need to know they’re okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly.”
    </p>
<p>
     They headed to the bar and Jen took back the first lot of drinks while Agatha waited for Lilia and Sharon’s bottle of wine and Rio’s coke. Her mind was racing. It had to be something to do with family. Had something happened with Lorna’s estate? Had there been a push back with the book? Surely, though, it couldn’t be that bad. At least not enough to prompt such a reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so deep in thought that she didn’t notice the flash of scarlet beside her until it was too late.
    </p>
<p>
     “Looking very dapper tonight, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     She sighed. “Not now, Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we agreed to get on for the evening?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stole a glance her way. She had seen Wanda from afar, in her glamourous attire, yet that wasn’t what she noticed. Wanda had put her hair up and let her bangs roam free. She had loved her hair like that when they were together, and Wanda knew that very well.
    </p>
<p>
     It still looked good, and Agatha had to admit, she liked the hair. Yet her mind was still focused on the beautiful brunette across the room, and so she looked back to the row of spirits behind the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s getting on and you doing this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This.” Agatha gestured between them. “You flirting, me getting pissed off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then don’t get pissed off.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then don’t flirt with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t help it,” Wanda insisted. “I’m sorry but I didn’t expect you to show up in a suit like
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you look very nice also, but I have my beautiful date waiting for me.” Agatha clicked her fingers at the bartender. “How long does it take to get to pour a fucking coke?”
    </p>
<p>
     The bartender quickly gave her the wine and likely broke the record in pouring a glass of coke from tap. He placed it on the bar in front of her and Agatha snatched it up, glaring at him as he retreated.
    </p>
<p>
     “So can we dance later?” Wanda asked. “Show of solidarity and all?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a chance,” Agatha told her, before taking her drinks back to the table. When she got there, everyone was quiet. Jen was staring at Alice, Alice and Lilia were staring at Rio, Rio was looking at Agatha, and Sharon just looked confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wine for the ladies.” Agatha handed Lilia the bottle, before placing the glass of coke in front of Rio. “And a coke for you, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     When she sat back down, Rio looked at her cautiously. “Was that Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What did she say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not much,” Agatha assured. “Don’t worry about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her for a moment, before squeezing her hand and taking a sip from her coke. Agatha looked over to Jen, who simply shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Something wasn’t right. Not at all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The gala moved into the ballroom, and all the boring guys in suits stayed back at the tables to set the world to rights while everyone else headed to the dancefloor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loved a good dance, especially when her girlfriend looked fucking hot shaking those gorgeous hips of hers. That and the champagne was almost enough to distract from the heavy cloud hovering over her.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost.
    </p>
<p>
     The DJ must have been a Tina Turner fan because after starting up with ‘The Best’, they went straight into ‘Proud Mary’. Rio had tried to keep up, but it seemed she wasn’t as young as she used to be, and had to tap out before the end.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed her to the edge of the dancefloor, laughing breathlessly. “I forgot how fun that song is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. “You’re a party animal, Miss Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness-Vidal,” Agatha reminded her. “Mrs.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet,” Rio pointed out, but Agatha waved her off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Semantics.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could reply, the Spice Girls started to play, and Jen came bursting through the crowd. She dived forward and grasped Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s our song!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha made a show of sighing. “Be right back, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched Agatha being ‘dragged’ onto the dancefloor by her best friend, laughing at their coordinated dance moves. Maybe Agatha was the dork in this relationship after all.
    </p>
<p>
     She noticed Alice step up to stand beside her. “They’re certainly a pair.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They are,” Rio agreed. “Where are Lilia and Sharon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Out there dancing. They’re actually a cute couple.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re all cute couples,” Rio reminded her. “Especially me and Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you day,” Alice answered lightly, but the pause that followed was heavy, and Rio waited for whatever it was her sister was struggling to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, she found the words.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do the cops know?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “I don’t think so.”
    </p>
<p>
     The story alone would have made headlines; add the fact she was a rock star’s stepdaughter, and she’d have been the subject of TV documentaries and podcasts for years to come. Branded an evil child, never able to have a normal life. That’s what her parents had shielded her from.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice frowned. “So they really think it was just an accident.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was an accident.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but they think…”
    </p>
<p>
     “They think the story everyone knows,” Rio insisted. “And that’s how it’s staying.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not ruining my life, Alice.” Rio looked out to Agatha, who was still dancing and laughing with Jen. “For the first time in as long as I can remember, I’m happy. I’m settled. I’ve found the love of my life. I’m not throwing that away. Neither of my moms would want that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hung her head. “I just don’t know what to do. I just can’t believe you’ve lived with this alone for so long. How can you do it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t reply. She had no answer to that, because the guilt ate her up every day.
    </p>
<p>
     The song changed, and the opening chords to ‘Don’t Dream it’s Over’ rang through the room. Agatha walked back to them and held her hand out to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dance with me, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and took her hand gladly. She allowed Agatha to lead her back onto the dancefloor, and as firm hands grasped her hips, she hooked her hands behind her girlfriend’s neck, letting her sway them to the music.
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw them once,” Agatha said over the music. “They’re one of my favourite bands.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you don’t just like it because of TikTok?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and shook her head. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned. “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     They shared a sweet kiss, and Rio savoured it as if it was her last. She never took a moment with Agatha for granted, but she wanted to cherish this one more than usual.
    </p>
<p>
     When they pulled apart, she found Agatha’s eyes studying her face. “Is everything okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Rio kept on a smile. “I’m great.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Agatha pressed. “Because you and Alice have been acting kind of weird. Jen and I are a bit worried.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be,” Rio quickly insisted. “We’re fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you su-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you mean what you said before?” Rio asked. “About wanting to be Mrs Harkness-Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, we’re already planning to have kids. Of course I want to marry you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then let’s do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked at her. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s go get married. Right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you joking around? Because that isn’t funny.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m serious,” Rio insisted. “Let’s get married.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her for a moment before shaking her head. “No, Rio. Somethings not right and you’re not telling me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you don’t want to marry me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I never said that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then let’s go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, well, well,” a familiar voice said beside them. “Aren’t you two just adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tore her eyes away from Agatha to shoot Wanda a fiery glare. “Get lost.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda gasped in offense, placing a hand over her heart. “Excuse me for wanting to make conversation with my colleague and her partner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “Wanda, we’re dancing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a social event, Agatha,” Wanda pointed out. “You need to socialize with people other than your friends and…her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda,” Agatha warned. “You said you weren’t going to do this tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like she ever wasn’t going to,” Rio grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda pursed her lips. “How about we talk somewhere more private?” She stole a disgusted look at Rio. “Minus the date.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scoffed. “That’s so not happening. So do you mind getting the fuck away. We’re busy here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked Rio up and down. “I’m sure you are, dressed like that. Practically draping yourself over her like a wh-”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled away from Agatha. “You want to finish that sentence?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha yanked her back. “Just ignore her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ignore her?” Rio questioned, loud enough for people to look their way. “I’ve had enough of her bullshit, Agatha. I’m so fucking done with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha agreed in a quieter tone. “Just not here, honey. Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio relented and put an arm around her. “Let’s get out of here.”
    </p>
<p>
     They started to walk off, and Rio couldn’t wait to leave. To get out of that damn gala, away from Wanda and the secret she now shared with her sister. Back to Agatha’s, where she was safe. Where the outside world didn’t matter. Where it was just them, and nothing else.
    </p>
<p>
     Besides Scratchy of course, but he was no trouble.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so close to walking away. So close to the end of a horrible night. But that
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     voice had to pipe up again.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, she was never embarrassed of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swirled round. She couldn’t help herself. She just saw red.
    </p>
<p>
     It was like she was in her body, but unable to control it. One moment she had her arm around Agatha, and the next she was storming back. She saw her arm swing, before feeling the sharp collision of her fist against Wanda Maximoff’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda fell to the ground with a thump, accompanied by gasps from all around. The music cut off, and suddenly the room was still.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha raced to her side. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her hand and saw she’d cut a knuckle. Shit, shit, shit.
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze fell to the ground, where Wanda lay, clutching her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     People came running over, kneeling beside Wanda to check she was alright. The suits came running through, all startled and confused. One of which was Mike the Sleezebag.
    </p>
<p>
     He knelt beside Wanda like a fucking knight and took her hand. “Wanda, are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do I fucking look okay?!” she cried. “That mad bitch hit me!”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike stood and looked to her, then to Agatha. His face was set in a stern glower. “What the hell is this?”
    </p>
<p>
     The panic hit her like a freight train.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d messed up again.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d done something bad.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to run.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she did.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raced out of the doors after her. She’d left the scene behind without a thought. She didn’t bother with their coats, or bags, or anything. All that mattered was Rio. Her lovely, caring, compassionate Rio who was in total crisis.
    </p>
<p>
     She managed to catch up with her on the sidewalk, grasping her by the shoulders. “Rio, wait.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled from her touch quickly but didn’t run. She faced her, cheeks stained with tears.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to go back inside, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going anywhere.” She moved to step towards her, but Rio staggered backwards. Agatha held up her hands. “It’s okay, Rio. You’re with me. We can fix this. Everything will be fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was a lie. There was no good way of fixing this other than begging Wanda to not press assault charges. The rest, well, the rest didn’t matter in that moment. Only Rio mattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Fresh tears fell down Rio’s face. “You don’t understand, Agatha. I’m bad. I’m really bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re not,” Agatha insisted. “You did what I’ve wanted to do for weeks. We get mad sometimes, and it was just a punch…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t
     <em>
      understand
     </em>
     .” Rio’s breathing got heavier, her body shaking with the tidal wave of tears that took over her. “I’ve always been bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you ha-”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t mean to,” Rio sobbed. “You have to believe me, Agatha. I loved her. I loved her so much. I didn’t mean to hurt her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “Honey, I don’t understand. Are we still talking about-”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hugged her arms around herself and sobbed impossibly harder. “I thought they were pretty flowers.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was completely lost. “Honey, what flowers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She always used pretty flowers. She looked so sad that I was going, and I wanted to make her smile. I put them in the pot when she wasn’t looking. I wanted it to be a surprise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha understood.
    </p>
<p>
     Tears prickled her eyes. “Oh, honey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know what it was, Agatha. I didn’t. I didn’t. I didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t,” Agatha agreed, taking a step forward. “You didn’t mean to. I know you didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     She reached for Rio, but she flinched away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I can’t. I can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s go home,” Agatha encouraged, trying to stay calm while her heart beat hard in her chest. “Let’s talk properly there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m bad,” Rio said again. “I’ve ruined everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You haven’t ruined anything,” Agatha insisted. “I love you. Nothing else matters.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her for a moment before shaking her head. “No, no, I can’t. Agatha, I can’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can.” Agatha reached forward to touch her arm, to take her hand. “I lo-”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed her away. “No!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fell backwards.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to brace herself with her hand, but the fall was too harsh. A sharp pain ran up her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!” She tried to sit up, but she couldn’t. The pain was too much.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood over her, eyes wide with horror. “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” A rush of footsteps approached them, and soon Jen was stood between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get the hell away from her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen!” Agatha cried, her voice mingling with Alice’s identical cry.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio staggered backwards. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’d never…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bullshit!” Jen snapped. “I saw you! You pushed her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen, no,” Agatha tried to sit up, only to wince again. Jen whirled round to look at her, while Alice knelt at her side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it your arm?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re hurt.” It was a statement, not a question, but Agatha still shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine.” She looked up to Rio. “Rio, I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her, her face etched with a sadness to pure for her to stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stepped up to Rio. “You get the hell out of here right now!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen, no. She didn’t…”
    </p>
<p>
     But it was too late. Rio darted off, faster than before, disappearing into the night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit!” Alice jumped to her feet and raced after her. “Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen moved to kneel beside Agatha. “Let me help you up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slapped her hand away. “You’ve done enough, Kale.”
    </p>
<p>
     More footsteps approached, and Lilia and Sharon came into view. Sharon was beside her in an instant and helped her sit up. “Are you hurt?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to say no, but Jen beat her to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s hurt her left hand.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared at her, only to wince when Sharon touched the hand in question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Agatha, I think we need to get you to a hospital.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll go find them,” Lilia insisted, stepping to the curb to hail a taxi. “But you need to get that checked.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon wrapped an arm around her. “It’ll be okay, sweetie. It’ll all be okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let the tears flow. In that moment, she couldn’t see anything being okay ever again.

<p>
     Her wrist wasn’t broken, just a bit of bruising and some muscle strain. The doctor said she was lucky. A fall like that could have ended with her snaping her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t feel lucky. Not at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll make you something to drink,” Sharon said as she and Jen followed Agatha into her apartment. “Then why don’t you get into bed?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond. She had her phone to her ear. The line rang and rang, but Rio didn’t pick up. She cursed under her breath and ended the call. “Pick up, Rio. Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, come sit down,” Jen pleaded. “You’ve still hurt yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her wrist did still hurt, but it was nothing compared to the pain in her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     She glared at Jen. “Call Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen frowned. “Why can’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you’re the one who got us into this mess,” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me? What about your psycho girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t call her a psycho!”
    </p>
<p>
     “She pushed you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was an accident!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, enough.” Sharon stepped between them. “Jen, call Alice and see what’s happening. Agatha, please just sit down for two minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Both women did as they were asked, and as Jen stepped into the bedroom to call her girlfriend, Agatha accepted the cup of hot cocoa Sharon handed her and slumped onto the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon sat beside her and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. “I hate seeing you so sad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate being so sad,” Agatha admitted. “Thanks for looking after me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to thank me, hun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah looked down at her cup of cocoa. “She won’t answer my calls, Sharon. I don’t know what to do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just give her some time to cool off. She loves you so much. She’ll call you back and all this will be sorted.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her hopefully. “You think?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded. “You two belong together. You’ll find a way back to each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “Our invisible string.” She looked to Sharon and saw she was confused. “It’s something Rio says. She says we were always tied by a string that led us to each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then have faith it’ll work again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen walked back into the room. “Alice said that Rio is fine and resting. She’s going to keep me updated. She said to give them space.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a sip of her cocoa. It was still too hot, but she didn’t care. She enjoyed the burn.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe you should get to sleep,” Sharon suggested. “Let yourself rest, so you can look at everything fresh in the morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “I don’t think I can.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio hadn’t slept.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice had tried to calm her down. She’d insisted on taking her back to her apartment and snuggled up on the bed with her. Like they did when they were kids.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice kept saying she was sorry, but Rio didn’t speak. She couldn’t. Her whole life had fallen apart in the space of ten minutes and now she had nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     In the end, she pretended to sleep. She just lay there, numb, listening for the door. Wanda was going to call the police if she hadn’t already. She was sure of it. A part of her hoped she would. She just wanted it all to be over.
    </p>
<p>
     It was early morning when the knock came, and Alice jumped off the bed to answer it. She heard Lilia’s voice in the living room and Rio sat up in time to see both women enter the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello you.” Lilia sat on the bed and held out her little purse. “You left this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the bag with a weak smile. “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome.” Lilia looked between her and Alice. “Now, will one of you tell me what the hell went on last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s really complicated,” Alice began. “A lot happened, and I don’t think one thing, or person, was totally to blame for what hap-”
    </p>
<p>
     “I killed my mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia eyes snapped to her. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked in a sharp breath. “She put flowers in her tea. You know, to make an infusion. She was good with plants. She grew all kinds for people to buy, and I’d help her in the nurseries when I was with her. It was all at the back of our house. She’d gotten a bit of money in the divorce and bought some land. She always told me to explore but to stay out of the little greenhouse. It was important I didn’t go in there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My mom wrote that she was growing plants for a local college lab,” Alice added. “Things weren’t as strict back then. Not as much red tape.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway, there were these white flowers. I used to look at them through the glass, but the door was always locked, so I could never go in. Anyway, Mom was getting me ready to go to my dad’s and, I don’t know, I guess she was sad. She hated it when I left. I wanted to cheer her up, so I went to find her some flowers. The greenhouse must have been open or something, I can’t remember, and I got the plant and managed to throw it in the tea she was brewing on the hob.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia reached out to take her hand. Rio braced herself and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got a nasty rash over my hands and my dad took me to hospital. The doctor gave me some stuff to help but told my dad to keep me away from poisonous plants. He got mad that my mom had let me near them, so went to confront her. That’s when he found her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My dad and Lorna put two and two together, so asked me if I’d put anything in the tea. I said yes, but I was too little. I didn’t understand what I’d done. They decided to keep it between them, so I wouldn’t have to live with the guilt. Then when I was fifteen, we were on tour, and we got taken on some nature walk by our hosts. Alice and I were messing around, and I fell into some poison ivy. Lorna insisted I see a doctor, and while I was there, he noted I had a similar case in my notes from when I was six. By then, I didn’t remember that. I was too little, but I remembered that weekend. I remembered my mom had died because she ingested large quantities of Lily of the Valley. I researched it, and touching the roots cause irritation. I confronted my dad about it, and he told me the truth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’ve had to live with that?” Lilia asked. “All these years?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “I was already interested in plants, but then it became my mission to educate people. To stop another little kid being able to do what I did. I know it can never make up for what happened, but I was trying. I really was. I hated myself, and I did for so long. I can’t change what I did. I wish I could. I wish I could more than anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia reached over and pulled her into a hug. “I know, my dear. I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now I don’t know what to do.” Fresh tears began to fall. “Alice found out through Lorna’s journals and we talked about it last night…”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia looked to Alice. “You couldn’t have just spoken to her another time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hung her head in shame. “I’m sorry. I know I reacted badly. I just…what bothered me more was that she hid it from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course she hid it,” Lilia snapped. “And now look what you’ve done.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t do anything,” Rio insisted. “I did. I killed my mom. I kept the secret. I punched Wanda. I…I hurt Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you didn’t,” Alice insisted. “We all saw you were just trying to keep her back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen didn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Jen is an idiot,” Alice stated firmly. “I love her, but she was out of line.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I…”

     “I think everything got way out of hand last night,” Lilia settled, before pointing to the bag. “Now, that thing has been going off like crazy, so you better check it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened the bag

      53 missed calls from Agatha

<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio answer your phone!!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Rio please I’m really worried
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      AGATHA
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I love you please talk to me.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Jen said she’s back home but wants to see you,” Alice told her. “She’s totally fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There you go,” Lilia grinned. “Call her back and everything will be alright!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the messages, and a sickening feeling rose in her gut. Perhaps Agatha was okay now, but how long would that last? She was a disaster. A cursed disaster who just seemed to do nothing but hurt the people she loved most. And she loved Agatha more than anything.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t do this.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened Agatha’s contract information and scrolled down to find those harsh red letters:
     <strong>
      Block Caller.
     </strong>
     Rio pressed the button before tossing her phone aside.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Alice gasped. “Why did you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t be near her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t just shut her out,” Lilia argued. “You need to just take a moment and…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve taken enough moments,” Rio insisted. “I hurt her. It’s over.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” she snapped. “It’s done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Lilia shared a concerned look, but didn’t argue. Not that it would have made a damn bit of difference.
    </p>
<p>
     She would never hurt Agatha again. This was her way of making sure of that.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha banged her fist against the apartment door. It was mid-morning, and her patience had worn thin. “Rio, open the door and speak to me, right now!”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried the phone again, but it wasn’t even connecting now, and her texts kept bouncing back. Which either meant she’d busted her phone, or she’d blocked her. She suspected the latter, and Agatha wasn’t having it.
    </p>
<p>
     She slammed her hand against the door. “Rio, if you’re going to break up with me you can do it to my face!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked round to see Lilia approaching her from the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia, I need to speak to Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not here,” Lilia told her. “She’s at Alice’s.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, what’s her address?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t tell you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her arms. “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia’s shoulders slumped. “Come inside.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed her into the apartment and stood by while Lilia put away her coat away, before they both sat at the dining table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is she okay?” Agatha asked first.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s…it’s a lot, Agatha. Years of pain and hurt have just collapsed onto her. She needs time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, Lilia, but I need to see her. She won’t talk to me, and she’s blocked my number. I just want to be there for her. I mean, we’re pretty much engaged. She can’t just ghost me like this!”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia gave her a sad smile. “I know you want to see her, and Alice and I think she’s making a mistake, but she thinks that…she doesn’t want to hurt you. This is her way of making sure of that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But she’s hurting me now!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but she’s so low she can’t see straight. Just be patient. Perhaps she will see reason once things calm down. Has there been any news about Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. That side of things had also been radio silent.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lets hope it stays that way.” Lilia reached for something at the end of the table “Now, I believe this is yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was the manuscript. The manuscript Rio had amended, with a promise for the future scribbled on the front. A future that may no longer exist.
    </p>
<p>
     Tears stung at her eyes. “I love her so much, Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, my dear. I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha headed back to her apartment and decided to call Rebecca. Her sister answered after two rings.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hey, how was the gala?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a breath. “Rebecca, can I stay at your place tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Why? What’s wrong?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A tear trailed down her cheek. “I think me and Rio broke up.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh.”
     </em>
     She heard her sister rummaging around on the other end.
     <em>
      “I’ll come pick you up.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “No, Rebecca.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “You’re not driving all that way on your own. Just get yourself and that rabbit of yours ready, okay? I’m setting off now.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Thanks, Rebecca.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Anytime,”
     </em>
     her sister insisted.
     <em>
      “Now go pack a bag!”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rebecca arrived quicker than she expected, greeting her at the front of the building with a big hug. “My big sister.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grimaced and pulled away. “I may be heartbroken, but we’re not doing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine. Look, I hope you’re not mad, but I didn’t come alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha watched as the passenger door opened and Billy jumped out. He raced around the car to hug her tight.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” he said into her hair. “I overheard Mom on the phone, and I had to come get you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes and held him tight. This was the hug she needed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice ordered take-out, but Rio couldn’t eat. All she could do was stare at the TV, her eyes not comprehending what was on it. Her mind was too busy torturing her.
    </p>

    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laid on the sidewalk, pain etched on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked the memories away and checked her phone. Lilia had messaged her, asking if she was okay, and Jen had sent a half apology, half telling off message that she chose to ignore. As she read through an email from the college about lab protocol, an Instagram message popped up.
    </p>
<p>
     From Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tensed. Why had he messaged her? Did he know?
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you okay?” Alice asked beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Rio insisted, before opening up the message.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      BILLY
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Why won’t you talk to Agatha?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip, trying to think of the best way to explain this to a teenage boy. In the end, she used the cop-out.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      It’s complicated.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     His reply came quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      BILLY
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      You promised you wouldn’t hurt her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I didn’t mean to.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      BILLY
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I really liked you. I thought you’d make her happy. Now you’re ghosting her? Why would you do that?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A tear trailed down her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      RIO
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I don’t want to hurt her anymore.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      BILLY
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I hate you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She tried to reply, but Billy had blocked her account.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio searched up Agatha’s account. Her girlfriend hadn’t used it much, but there were enough photos on there for her to look at.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t bother with the ones of them together. She didn’t want to see her own face. Instead, she looked at the pictures she knew Billy had made her post. Selfies of them together, Agatha the proud aunt beside her much-loved nephew. Rio looked at both of them. She loved Agatha, but she’d grown to love the Kaplans too. Especially Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Another person she’d now hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put her phone aside and looked to Alice. “I made a mistake, didn’t I? I should have called Agatha back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You still could.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to hurt her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. “For fuck sake, Rio. Enough. You know the way you hurt people most? This avoidance shit. Thinking you’re sparing their feelings by keeping something from them or keeping yourself from them. You love her, she loves you. She clearly wants to see you. Fucking call her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her phone. “Okay, you’re right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly! Call her now!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I will. After whatever this is. Is that Tom Cruise?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not even watching,” Alice accused. “I could hear your brain ticking from over here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay but just give me a minute. I need to think of what I’m going to say.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, but the more you put it off, the harder it’ll be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew this was going to be hard either way, but she’d push through it. For Agatha, even if it was to hear her voice one las time.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat on the floor in her sister’s guest room. The room she had once lived in for weeks, months even. Back then, she spent a lot of time in that very spot, the cool floor stabilizing her panic. Those days had been so uncertain, from not knowing if Billy would ever wake up to wondering if he would ever remember them again.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, she was nursing an aching heart.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio. The one person she’d ever given her whole heart to, her whole body, her whole soul. The love of her life. Her entire future. And just like that, she’d ran away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had tried to understand it all. Her panic, Wanda, the truth about her mom…
    </p>
<p>
     Just thinking about that last part made her feel sick. She could picture the photograph in Rio’s room of her and her mom. Tiny Rio, with her little grin. Tiny Rio, who made a mistake, and now Big Rio was breaking at the seams.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to be there for her, to hold her. To stay by her side, for better and for worst. But Rio had pushed her away, had put up a wall of people and technology to her from getting close.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted forever, but in that moment, she would take ten minutes. To talk, to try persuading her not to give up, or at the very least to say goodbye.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a light knock at the door. She smiled, knowing exactly who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on in.”
    </p>
<p>
     The door creaked open, and Billy slipped inside, already in his plaid pyjamas. She guessed by the way he tiptoed that his parents had gone to bed, and really, he should be at least pretending to sleep in his own room.
    </p>
<p>
     He went over to wave at Scratchy in his cage, before sitting on the floor beside her. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “What does okay even mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Billy admitted. “I used to say it a lot after the accident. It’s easier than being specific.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No word from Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     She shook her head. “I’ll wait a little longer.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy bowed his head. “I hate her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do. I told her so.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up. “What? When?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Instagram.”
    </p>
<p>
     She’d forgotten about that!
    </p>
<p>
     She went to get up, to grab her phone, to send another message, but Billy touched her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy fished out his phone and opened his camera roll. “I screenshot our conversation before I blocked her.”
    </p>
<p>
     He showed her the screen, and Agatha read over the messages. “Billy, you shouldn’t get involved.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I hate seeing you like this. I don’t want you with someone who can just cut you off like this. Like Eddie did to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio isn’t Eddie.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she’s worse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “How so?”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked to her, his eyes glistening with tears. “Because she didn’t just make you love her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Billy.” She wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him close. “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have nothing to sorry about.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I was ridiculous. I shouldn’t have let you two get so close so quickly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You thought she was the one,” Billy argued. “Right from the beginning. I could tell!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. She wanted to scream the truth. That it hadn’t been real, until it was. Yet she could see he was upset, and she hated to see him like this. The look on his face brought back memories of searching the streets at 2am and consoling him as he cried and cried.
    </p>
<p>
     It was that look that ignited a fire inside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, if Rio wants to ghost me, I’ll ghost her back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Billy sat up. “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached for her phone and opened Rio’s contact details. She hovered her thumb over the block button, the image of Rio’s sweet smile flashing before her eyes. It hurt like a knife through the chest, but instead of sorrow, the pain turned to anger.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed the button, before blocking her Instagram also, cutting off Rio completely.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her head high. Two could play at this game, and she would always win.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio threw her phone down. The call had cut off. She knew what that meant.
    </p>
<p>
     Sitting on the floor at the foot of Alice’s bed, she leant her head back against the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d waited too long, and now it was done.

<p>
     Agatha entered Mike’s office with a black coffee in her hand and her head held high. Despite the fact she had barely slept for three nights and that her heart felt like a brick weighing down her chest, she went in with a strong front. After all, she was ready for a fight.
    </p>
<p>
     Mike was sat at his desk, reading something on his computer. He looked up when he heard her enter and gestured to the seat opposite him. “Agatha, please sit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down, putting her coffee on the desk before her. “Well, come on then. Tell me how this is going to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike sighed and sat up. “Agatha, I know this wasn’t your fault, but something needs to be done.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a physical assault.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that all you have to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I don’t know what you expect me to say.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike shook his head. “I don’t understand what’s going on between you and Wanda, and I’m sure there was some reason for Friday’s ruckus, but what your girlfriend did....”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not my girlfriend,” Agatha said quickly. It was the first time she’d admitted it to someone else, and to herself. It hurt more than she thought it would. “Not anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike blinked at her in surprise before smiling. “That’s brilliant news!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah folded her arms. “Me breaking up with my serious partner is ‘brilliant news’?”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike held up his hands. “Forgive me, but I’m glad. After all, the board is not too happy about all this. It’s nice to see that you are putting the company first. ”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to cry out and say it had nothing to do with the fucking company, that she had been ready to stay with Rio through thick and thin. That she would have packed her office up that morning and left without a second thought. But Rio pushed her away and seeing Billy so upset had been the last straw. She couldn’t cause him, or herself, anymore heartache.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet while Rio had taken Agatha’s heart, she had not taken her mind, and she was too smart to miss an opportunity that would go in her favour. And so, she forced a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” she lied. “Anything for the company.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda has been gracious enough not to press charges, but she has asked that Rio be banned from the building. She has also asked for a meeting with you and the board later to discuss the steps forward. You can tell them of this new development then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept up her fake smile as she stood from her seat, picking up her coffee with one hand, while holding out the other. “I will be there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Great, I’ve already sent the details to your assistant,” Mike shook her hand firmly. “I’m pleased, Agatha. Truely.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha lied once more. “Onwards and upwards, as they say.”
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was awoken by a loud bang at her bedroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio Vidal, get up!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned and checked her phone. It was barely past nine!
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong with you?” Rio called back, burying her face back in the pillow. The door swung open, and Lilia stormed her way inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve had enough of this moping.” She pulled the sheets off her. “Get up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio jumped out of bed. “Lilia, what the hell?!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t just stay in bed all day, Rio. I know you’re upset, but you need to do something about it or learn to get on with it. Either way, I have nowhere to be today, and I will spend it keeping you out of that bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled and stormed out of her room. She made her way into the living area and laid herself out on the couch instead. Lilia followed and stood before her, hands on her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aren’t you meant to be meeting your thesis advisor today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll cancel.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you won’t. You’ll go and get the feedback you need to finish this degree. And I want to you to talk to Agatha today as well. This ridiculousness between you two has gone on long enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How?” Rio questioned. “She blocked my number.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, before the days of cell phones, we did this magical thing called talking face to face.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat herself up. “What if she doesn’t want to see me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then make an excuse. Don’t you have some of her stuff here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not much.” Rio thought over what she had. Lilia had already told her she gave Agatha back the script. That left some clothes she’d ‘borrowed’, the key to her apartment, and her grandmother’s locket.
    </p>
<p>
     “Drop whatever you have off to her after you see your advisor and use the excuse to talk with her. Take it from an old wise lesbian; even if you can’t salvage anything from this, you need closure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t want closure. She wanted everything back to the way things were. If she kept her cool, if Alice hadn’t said anything, and Wanda hadn’t been a total bitch, they’d still be happy. Perhaps they’d have even talked about what the amendment she made, and their future would well and truly be underway.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet she guessed Lilia was right. She needed to get out of this limbo, for both their sakes.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about a reading?” Lilia grabbed her card and made Rio move up to sit beside her. She shuffled the cards before laying three face-down on the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     “The past.” Lilia turned over the card and revealed The Tower Reversed. “You had this before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A great change,” Rio said bitterly. Things had certainly changed a lot since then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now the present.” Lilia turned over the card. “The Star. A message of hope, optimism, and offers guidance to the future.” She turned the last card and smiled. “I hoped as much.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the card and frowned. “The lesbians again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Ten of Cups,” Lilia corrected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will you tell me what it means now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shook her head. “The only way you will know is if you acknowledge the past and take hold of the present.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a crap psychic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia chuckled. “We’ll see about that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled herself up from the couch. “I best get ready. Professor Odinsdottir won’t like it if I’m late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Take my advice,” Lilia told her. “You’ll regret it if you don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio headed back to her room. She needed to get dressed…and maybe put together a bag.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wanda Maximoff appeared late morning, slipping in when Agatha had asked Sharon to get her some paperwork from upstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wondered how long she had waited for the opportunity to strike. After all, Mike was likely all too happy to inform his new favourite colleague of their conversation earlier, and she could imagine her ex was of
     <em>
      so delighted
     </em>
     by the news.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda entered wordlessly and sat in the chair opposite her, her hands in her lap. While she looked the same as always, Agatha did spot a bruise under her eye that her make-up couldn’t quite conceal, the only proof of what transpired three nights before.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her, choosing to instead focus on her emails. After a while, however, her intense stare was grating her too much to concentrate. She took of her glances and levelled Wanda with a glare.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come to gloat?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Wanda answered. “I came to see if you were okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you care?” Agatha snapped, only for Wanda to give her an exasperated look.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know why, Agatha. And I wanted to tell you myself that I don’t intend to go file any charges against Rio. I know from personal experience that losing you is punishment enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha said nothing. She refused to discuss any of this with her. The silence didn’t seem to put her off though.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know this is fresh, and you’re still processing everything, but I would like to remind you again that you have other options.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up. “Wanda, I’m not talking about this again so please get out of my office.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have a ready-made family waiting, Agatha. Me and the boys. Our boys.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re not mine, Wanda. Their Vis’s. You know, the guy you cheated on me with.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Biology doesn’t matter. They’ll love you. We can have cute family days out and boring days when we’re just dropping them off at school before work and have family vacations and spent the holidays with your sister’s family. Billy will love having two little cousins, I’m sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough,” Agatha snapped. “Wanda, I’m really not in the mood for this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s go for dinner tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed. “I’m not going to dinner with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll let you consider it,” Wanda countered. “I’m eager to move things along, Agatha. You need to consider the idea that all this unfortunate business may have led you right where you were always meant to be. With us. With a family who’ll love you deeply.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could respond, the door to the office flew open. Sharon ran in, pointing her finger at Wanda accusingly. “She snuck in! I’m calling security!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, Sharon. Ms Maximoff was just leaving.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sighed and got to her feet. “Just think about it, Agatha. It can just be dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once she left, Sharon folded her arms and looked at Agatha. “You’re not going on a date with her, are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “No, Sharon. I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, because I’m still rooting for you and Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha offered her a weak smile, before holding out her hand. “Is that the paperwork?”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded and handed it over.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you.” Agatha flipped through the pages. “And Sharon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please don’t talk about Rio. Not today, anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon nodded in understanding. “I’ll be at my desk if you need me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah watched her go, waiting until the door shut before tossing the paperwork on her desk and leaning back in her chair. She looked at the photos on her desk. The ones of her, Billy and Rio. She wanted to crawl into the photos and stay there forever, back when everything was good and happy.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted Rio. Her Rio. The Rio who’d never do this to her. A Rio that she guessed never existed in the first place. And if that was the great love of her life, then she decided it would be the last.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was done with love, and she would show the board just how committed she really was.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By the time Rio got to the café, Hela had already ordered them a selection of desserts to share.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a sweet tooth today,” she explained. “And thought this would be fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded before taking a sip of her coffee. She wasn’t in a fun-having mood.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Hela began again. “How’s the thesis going?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not putting my mom in it,” Rio told her quickly. “I’d rather get a lower grade then bring all that up again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Thankfully, Hela nodded in understanding. “I appreciate that. I must say though, Rio, you look tired. Please say you’re not overworking yourself. The thesis in its current state will get you your doctorate without a doubt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not that,” Rio assured. “I…me and Agatha broke up. Or at least I think we did. We haven’t spoken since Friday. She’s blocked my number. Well, I blocked hers first but…it’s a long story.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It always is,” Hela said lightly. “Have you tried speaking to her face to face?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to try after this,” Rio admitted. “I don’t think it’ll do much good, but I have some of her stuff, so I guess that’ll get my foot in the door.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela whistled. “You must have done something really bad, Vidal. I’m almost impressed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her lap. Oh, she had no idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” her professor continued, “this may not be the most opportune moment, but I did hope to discuss something with you before we get fully into thesis talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?” Rio had to admit she was intrigued, if not a little bit nervous.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know I’ve been working back home writing my piece on native Scandinavian plant-life and their development. Well, I’ve found some samples of a mutated variation of digitalis purpurea. I was wondering if you would like to come work on the research with me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her in surprise. “Come with you? You mean go to…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Norway, yes. You could finish your thesis out there, and arrangements can be made for you to be back to defend it and to graduate. I wanted to offer it to you anyway, but I knew you were unlikely to leave your partner for months on end. However, if that is in fact all over and you need to get away, we can fly out on Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Friday? Like
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     Friday?”
    </p>
<p>
     Hela nodded. “I’ll need an answer by tonight so I can make all the arrangements. I’ll respect you decision either way, but I’d like it if you came. I think we’ll make a good team, you and I.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in understanding, and as Hela began to chatter about how the trip could further benefit her thesis, her gaze dropped to the floor. To the beat-up duffle bag filled with Agatha’s things.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t just leave. That had been her problem since the beginning. If only she hadn’t left that morning a year ago, and if she’d had pushed through her panic Friday night and stayed by Agatha’s side. Yet perhaps this was the guidance Lilia had talked about. The universe was guiding her forward, to a future she didn’t want, but would keep her moving. It would help others, prevent more families falling apart like her own, and stop another kid becoming as fucked up as she was. It would give her purpose, even if life would never be as colourful as it was before.
    </p>
<p>
     It was like she was at a crossroads, one path clear and the other blocked by thorned vines that would cut her limb from limb, though it led to the greater treasure. Norway was her escape, her getaway car. A path forward she didn’t have that morning. It was the clear way. The easy way.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet Rio knew she had to push through the thorns, even if it tore her apart in the process.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had been reading yet another mediocre manuscript when Sharon stepped sheepishly into her office.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I need to talk to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s up?” Agatah took off her glasses. “Is everything okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you said you didn’t want to talk about Rio? Well, I kind of need to right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sickening worry filled Agatha like a flood. “Is she hurt? What happened? Is she okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s fine,” Sharon quickly assured. “She’s just, well…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Spit it out, Sharon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s downstairs.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s
     <em>
      what?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “In the lobby,” Sharon specified. “Security stopped her. Mike got her banned from the building, but she’s insisting to see you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jumped to her feet, adrenaline shooting through her as she went to leave her office. “I’ll deal with this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, just keep calm,” Sharon called after, but Agatha didn’t listen. She stormed towards the elevator, ready for whatever battle waited for her at the bottom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was stood by the main doors, talking to one of the security guys. She seemed calm, a huge contrast from the last time Agatha saw her: all wide eyed and frantic, like a cornered animal. Yet when their eyes met, she saw the anxiousness in her lov-no,
     <em>
      ex’s
     </em>
     eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Agatha demanded, before dismissing the security guys. They backed off, knowing her reputation enough to trust she would handle the situation better than they ever could.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted to see you,” Rio answered. “To talk with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you should have thought about that before you ran off and blocked my number!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hung her head in shame. “I know and I tried to call you later on, but by then, you’d blocked me back. Which I totally understand, I do. I just I…I didn’t want the last time I saw you being that night. Not with…all that happening.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So that’s it?” Agatha questioned. “Are we just…done?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio replied. “Do you want us to be?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer. No, she didn’t want them to be done. She wanted to kiss Rio there and then and hold on to her forever. Yet things were complicated. With Billy, with work, with the entire nature of their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” she answered honestly. “I still love you, but I’m angry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in acceptance. “I get it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, it’s fine. I did this and I’m sorry. I truly am. I hate myself for hurting you, and I understand why you may never be able to forgive me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My wrist is fine…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not just talking about your wrist.” Rio looked down at her feet. “Look, this probably isn’t the best timing, or maybe it is, I don’t know, but my thesis advisor has asked me to come join her research lab in Norway. If I go, I leave on Friday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s anger returned full throttle. “So you’re running away from this? From me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no,” Rio quickly insisted. “Agatha, if there is even the smallest possibility that we can even just become friends, I’ll stay. Without question. But if you want me out of your life, then consider it done.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know whether to drop to her knees and beg her to stay or throw it right back in her face. She chose not to respond at all, and Rio seemed to get the message, as her shoulders slumped in defeat.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to give an answer by tonight. I’m going to go think it over for myself. Just let me know if you…Just know that I’ll love you no matter what you decide. If anything, I’m just glad I got to see you again, even if it is for the last time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn’t sure what to say. Her words weighted heavy on her chest, suffocatingly so.
    </p>
<p>
     “I brought you your stuff.” Rio held out a battered duffle-bag.  “I fixed the locket for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Agatha reached for the bag, their fingers brushing as she took it. Her fingers tingled with their warmth, and she wondered if that was the last time they’d ever touch.
    </p>
<p>
     She could see tears in Rio’s eyes, but she smiled. Not brightly, or happily, but lovingly. The kind of smile that comes with a goodbye.
    </p>
<p>
     “Before I let you go, I just want to say that the time we spent together was the happiest I’ve ever been. You’re amazing, Agatha Harkness, and I hope you have the most amazing life.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her leave, watched her walk by the windows in the direction of the subway station. Watched her wipe her cheeks with the back of her hand, before disappearing out of view. A tear trickled down her own cheek, but she quickly brushed it away and headed back to the elevator.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she made it back to her office, she placed the duffle bag on her desk. She had plenty of Rio’s stuff too. Mostly clothes and toiletries scattered around her apartment, and of course the photograph Alice had given them. She hadn’t wanted to move any of it, a part of her enjoying the illusion that Rio was still there. That she had just popped out and would be back with smiles and kisses at any moment. Unhealthy, she knew, but it brought her a small amount of comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     Off the top of her head, she couldn’t recall what she could have left at Rio’s. After all, she had only stayed there once, and she was certain she took everything home with her. Intrigued, she pulled open the zip to see what was inside.
    </p>
<p>
     On top was the set of keys she had given Rio a matter of days ago. Agatha picked them up and looked over the rabbit keychain, smiling softly. She wondered if Rio would have given her a spider one if she ever got a key for her and Lilia’s place. Though, knowing Rio, she’d give her multiple keychains, each as ridiculous as the last.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest seemed to be hoodies and shirts, some Agatha wouldn’t have cared to lose, or even noticed they were gone. One made her pause though. Her Fleetwood Mac t-shirt. She held it up to look at it properly. Memories flashed in her mind to that night over a year ago. When Rio emerged from her bathroom wearing it, how she had laid out on the bed in it waiting for her, how it rested between their chests as they kissed. How Agatha had brushed her hands against the soft material as they snuggled into each other to sleep, both believing they were at the start of something special.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha brought the material to her face and inhaled deeply. There was the underlining scent of her detergent, but the rest was all Rio. She hugged it to her chest and closed her eyes. In her mind, she was about to wake up that Friday morning with Rio in her arms, and it was all just a bad dream. Everything was fine. Everything was good. Everything was how was it should be.
    </p>
<p>
     She kept the t-shirt in her lap as she pulled the last pieces of clothes out, leaving only a jewellery box at the bottom. She recognised it was the one she had given Rio’s apartment keys in. A slight smile crossed her lips; Rio had wanted to keep the locket safe.
    </p>
<p>
     Opening the box, she found the locket resting safely inside. She picked it up and turned it over in her hand before opening it up. Something pink fell onto the desk. Agatha frowned. There hadn’t been anything in it before?
    </p>
<p>
     She picked the flash of pink up from her desk and examined it closely. It was withered and drying, but she could see what it was. A rose petal, at least a week or so old. She chuckled and shook her head. Only Rio would put a random flower petal in an antique locket.
    </p>
<p>
     She put it back and fastened the chain back around her neck, the locket clattering against the flat metal of her half-heart necklace that had taken its place. She reached up to touch them both, wondering what she should do. Whether she should call or not call. Whether she should try or if she should just let her go.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could make up her mind, there was a knock at her door, Sharon’s voice quickly following. “Agatha, your meeting with the board is in five minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     With a sigh, she shoved the clothes back in the duffle and got to her feet. “On my way.”
    </p>

<div>
<p>
     Agatha walked towards the conference room, her heart thumping hard in her chest. She tried to focus on the meeting, on her job, on the career she had spent years carefully crafting. Yet all she could think about was Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaving.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio in Norway.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio so far away that she’d never see her again.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought alone physically pained her. Yet could she really ask her to stay? To give up on an amazing opportunity to say with her, even though neither of them were sure what they were anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     She was almost at the conference room door when she heard someone call out her name. She looked round to see Wanda rushing towards her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad I caught up with you,” Wanda said once she reached her. “We can walk in showing a united front.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her and walked towards the conference room door, her jaw clenched tight. When they reached it, Wanda stood in the way with an irritating smirk on her lips. .
    </p>
<p>
     “I was wondering where that awful locket went.” Her eyes narrowed. “What’s that other necklace you’re wearing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha covered the broken heart with her hand. “Rio got me it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda hummed. “I’ll get you a better one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her tongue and reached for the door handle. “Shall we?”
    </p>
<p>
     With a smirk, Wanda stepped aside, and Agatha let herself into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     The board was already in the room when she entered, with Mike sat in the middle. She sat down in the first available seat, while Wanda quickly perched in the one opposite her.
    </p>
<p>
     This was going to be torture.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Mike began. “How are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Been better.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike nodded in understanding. “Well, to keep everyone updated, you and I had a discussion this morning regarding the incident on Friday night. However, an hour ago I was alerted that Miss Vidal had been stopped by security downstairs. Care to explain her reason for being here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She just brought me something,” Agatha answered, but she could see by the expressions of the board that it wasn’t an adequate answer. She didn’t have to say more, though, and she wouldn’t. Especially not with Wanda watching her so intensely.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand reached for her locket, running her thumb over the cameo image. She could lie, come up with an excuse that would satisfy the board and keep her ex at bay, but her mind wasn’t in the room. It was wherever Rio was, wondering if she’d made her own decision yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, regardless of that,” Mike continued, “Agatha told me something this morning which I believe will reassure us all that we can maintain a positive working environment, while also showcasing Agatha’s unrelenting loyalty to this company. I for one believe it shows she has exactly what it takes to be considered for a more senior role within our ranks.”
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes fell on Agatha, awaiting her to explain this precious piece of information, while Wanda and Mike looked on expectantly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio won’t be a problem,” Agatha answered simply. “For any of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How can you assure that?” A member of the board shot her a disapproving glare. “You’ve brought your dirty laundry here once, so why not again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, tell them what you told me,” Mike prompted with an eager smile. “Right when I raised similar concerns.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around the room. If she was honest, her decision had been made long before she entered the room. Before she left her office. Before Rio walked away from her in the lobby. A glance at Wanda Maximoff’s smug face gave her the push to see it through.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told Mike that Rio and I are no longer together,” Agatha answered, taking in the grin that appeared on Wanda’s face before raising it with a devious smirk of her own. “Which I intend to rectify as soon as possible.”
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Wanda’s face drop was satisfying beyond words.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Mike questioned. “Agatha, I thought we agreed this was the best for the company?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s not what’s best for me. I love Rio and there’s nothing anyone here can do about it.” She looked back at Wanda, who’s entire face seemed to have tightened with anguish.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is highly unprofessional,” Mike told her sternly. “How can you possibly expect to work here, with Ms Maximoff, and still remained involved with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I don’t intend to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mike frowned. “Don’t intend to what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Work here.” Agatha got to her feet. “Consider this my resignation.”
    </p>
<p>
     They called after her, of course they did, but Agatha walked out of the room with her head held high, a huge weight off her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     She headed back up to her office, saying hi to Sharon as she passed, before setting to work gathering her things. Luckily, she hadn’t brought many personal items (it was meant to be a productive space not a cosy one) but there were still some odd things floating around.
    </p>
<p>
     She tipped out a file box and got all the toiletries Jen had gifted her out of the bathroom, as well as the scented candles she had placed on the coffee table. She cleared her desk draws, before picking up the one item that mattered: the photo frame. Agatha looked at it and smiled, before wrapping it in one of her hoodies and shoving it in the duffel bag.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was all packed up, she put her handbag over one shoulder, the duffle over the other, and carried the box with both hands as she left her office for the last time.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon was stood by her desk nervously. “How did the meeting go?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha answered. “I quit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon’s eyes widened, before her face split into a huge grin. “Good for you!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was about to respond when she heard stomping feet heading their way. They both looked down the corridor to see Wanda Maximoff charging towards them.
    </p>
<p>
     Sharon reached for the phone, but Agatha shook her head. No, this she was facing head on.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell was that?” Wanda demanded. “You can’t just quit, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can and I did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re seriously throwing away all you’ve worked so hard for to be with
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh stop pretending to care about my career,” Agatha snapped. “If you did, you wouldn’t have pushed your way in here like a fucking parasite.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I only want the best for you, Agatha,” Wanda insisted. “And I know that’s being here with me. I’m the only one who understands you. Who understands your drive and ambition. You won’t find anyone better for you than me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I already did,” Agatha answered with conviction. “In a coffee shop a year ago. She’s worth more to me than any of this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda laughed bitterly. “How can she be? She’s nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a soon to be doctor of botany,” Agatha corrected with a pride. “With a gorgeous smile, ridiculous sense of humour, and the biggest, warmest heart I’ve ever known. From the moment I saw her, she was the one. I didn’t know it at the time, but I do now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s still nothing,” Wanda insisted. “And she’ll be worth even when I get her arrested for assault.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’ll report you for harassment,” Agatha levied. “Let’s see how that goes down for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s eyes widened. “Agatha, you know that’s not true. I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Said by every true stalker,” Agatha sassed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha please,” Wanda begged. “Just think about this. Is this what you really want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” she answered without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Goodbye Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Agatha…” Wanda tried but Agatha walked right past her towards the elevators. She had barely stepped inside the metal box before someone else rushed in. She expected it to be Wanda, and readied herself for another fight, but instead she was met with Sharon, wearing her coat with her handbag comically full.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Leaving,” Sharon answered as the doors slid shut. “I’m your assistant. Without you, I have no job.”
     <br/>
     Her heart dropped. She had been so caught up with emotion that she didn’t consider… “Sharon, I’m sorry. I didn’t think!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, none of that.” Sharon waved her off. “I’m happy you finally stood up for yourself. And I think you’ve made the right decision. You’re far too good this place, and I for one am looking forward to a bit of a break to spend time with my girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Girlfriend now?” Agatha teased. “Do I need to get you a bi flag pin?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you have a lesbian pin?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not,” Agatah lied. In fact, she had several. “Are you sure you’re alright? Money wise…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have Todd’s pension to keep me going,” Sharon assured her. “Though you must promise me if you need another assistant, I’ll be your first choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t want anyone else,” Agatha said truthfully. She would miss having Sharon with her most days, though if all went well there may be some hilarious double dates in their future. Not that she was allowing herself to be too hopeful.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what are you going to do?” her now former assistant asked. “Tell her you want to be with her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess?” Agatha shrugged her shoulders. “She said she was going to go think things over. I just hope we’re still on the same page.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to call her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha answered. “I know exactly where she is.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The botanical gardens became Rio’s special place when she moved to the city. She and Alice went the first time, wanting to explore more than the typical tourist traps. Of course she was going to love it, there was no doubt, but as they wandered through the carefully crafted gardens full of the finest and most beautiful plants, she felt so peaceful and safe. Despite being in the middle of a bustling city, with people walking through chattering while children ran around enjoying the adventure, her mind just seemed to drown out the noise. She could think, really think, about things she often struggled with.
    </p>
<p>
     She went there two days after her parents died. Alice said she needed to be alone for a while, so she went there to process. It didn’t make the pain go away, because nothing could, but it helped her make sense of things in her head. Since then, whenever something happened, she went there. Like when she was decided whether to do her PhD, and when she was debating to answer Lilia’s roommate ad, or when the hot lady from the coffee shop had ghosted her for no reason (though that turned out to be a classic case of bunny sabotage).
    </p>
<p>
     And so she figured it was the best place to go to think about what she should do next.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted Agatha. No doubt that trumped everything else. Yet she knew that was unlikely. The security had stopped her for a reason, and it wasn’t because Agatha told them to. That totally wasn’t her style. Which meant it was an order from somebody else in the company, most likely Mike, definitely encouraged by the red devil herself. Which would make them being together even more difficult than it already would be.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew how important the job was to Agatha. Though she had been complaining about it lately, she knew Agatha took great pride in all she had achieved in her career, and she couldn’t expect her to just throw all that away. Not after she had treated her so poorly.
    </p>
<p>
     The real question was did she actually want to go to Norway? Hela had talked a lot about Oslo, and Rio had to admit she was intrigued, but could she just leave like that? She didn’t want to lose her apartment, and the thought of leaving Alice and Lilia behind was a hard one, let alone leaving behind Webbers! Oh no, how could she?
    </p>
<p>
     (There was also Agatha. Even in the future when they were done for good, Rio knew she would always hold on to that hope. A hope that one day they’ll see each other in the street and end up going for coffee for old times sake. How they’d end up rekindling their romance and become a story of love defying all odds. Of that invisible string bringing them right back together where they both belonged).
    </p>
<p>
     Yet Hela’s offer was an opportunity others would dream of. To work on the ground, exploring plant life in a totally different environment and examining this newly found specimen. It sounded exciting, but she didn’t feel it. Perhaps it was broken heart, or perhaps she simply didn’t want to go. Even if it would distract her from her current pain.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood in the grand Victorian greenhouse, studying the white petals of the bloomed flower before her. So lost in contemplation that she didn’t notice someone had moved to stand beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that one called?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swore she imagined the voice. Swore her mind playing tricks on her, and she would look and see someone else stood there, totally unaware of the deep pain their words had unintentionally caused. Yet as she looked beside her, and her brown eyes met glimmering blue, there was no denying it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness, live and in person.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stewartia ovata,” she answered, her voice slightly shaken. “Or Mountain Camellia, if we use the most common term.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we certainly wouldn’t want to do that,” Agatha replied, and Rio couldn’t help but chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you know I’d be here?” she asked curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Last time we were here you said this was your place to unwind. This and basketball, but I figured this would be the place. Though I have been walking round the gardens for about twenty minutes looking for you. Why is this place so damn big?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You could have just called me,” Rio reminded her. “I unblocked your number.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Agatha admitted, “but I figured this would be more romantic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Romantic? Rio’s heart leapt. That sounded good…right?
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha stopped her. “You got to talk earlier. Now it’s my turn.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed nervously, before nodding.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I meant what I said earlier. You hurt me, Rio. You can’t just push me away like that. I was so worried, and I was confused, and it was like a living hell. But I guess I understand. The way I see it, communication has always been our issue, and the times we work, when we really work, are when we actually talk to each other. Face to face. No notes or messages or calls. Just you and me. So here it is. Rio Vidal, I think you should go to Norway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart dropped. No, no, no. This couldn’t be it. Not over some stupid trip she wasn’t sure she wanted to go on anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     She went to argue, but Agatha held up her hand to stop her. “It’s a huge opportunity, and you should grasp it with both hands. Your work is important, and this could be huge for your career.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bowed her head sadly. She guessed she was right, even if she hated it.
    </p>
<p>
     “But if you asked me what I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     you to do,” Agatha continued. “Well, that would be a totally different answer.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her head shot up. She thought she understood, but she had to be sure. “Y-you want me to stay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I want you to stay, you dork. I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but grin. “I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you can’t stay for me,” Agatha insisted. “We’ll make it work. We can call, and facetime, and I can come out to visit? I mean, I don’t want to assume, and I know we have a lot to talk about. A whole lot. But do you still want to try?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help it. She leaned forward and placed a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips. Oh, how she missed those lips. This kiss deepened, enough to make her breathless. She never wanted to wait this long to kiss her ever again.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled back, Agatha’s cheeks had an adorable red hue. Rio couldn’t help but be proud  of herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “That a good enough answer?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, clearing her throat. “Yep, got it loud and clear.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, but the niggle of doubt in the back of her mind made it fade. “How is this going to work?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “We’ll work on it together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But your job…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not an issue.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio frowned in confusion. “But how?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Simple. I quit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened. “You
     <em>
      what?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t working there anymore, not after everything. I should have quit the moment Wanda started meddling or at least tried doing something to stop her. I’m sorry I let it go so far.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in understanding. “And I’m sorry for punching her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. “Are you really?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Okay, maybe not, but I’m sorry it caused you trouble.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well now I’m free of her and that place, and I’m now totally available to visit you in Norway all the time! Maybe I could stay for a few weeks at a time? I don’t want to leave Scratchy for too long, but I’m sure Billy would love having him, even if it means plying his dad with allergy medication.”
    </p>
<p>
     The thought of having Agatha totally available to her was indeed an enjoyable one, though not entirely practical. “But what are you going to do? Find another job?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I have a lot of savings, and I have connections that I can use to get some freelance editing gigs. Maybe I’ll even work more on The Witches’ Road?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is very good,” Rio insisted. “I’d like to read it again sometime.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That can certainly be arranged,” Agatha teased, and Rio couldn’t help but blush. This woman was something else.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we go somewhere and talk?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds sensible,” Agatha agreed, stepping in the direction of the exit. “You coming?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold on.” Rio pulled out her phone. “I just need to do something first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t keep me waiting, Vidal. I’m ready to enjoy unemployment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head at her antics before typing out a message.
    </p>
<p>

     “Honey?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled as she pocketed her phone and took hold of her hand. “So, coffee?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “Coffee sounds good.”

     Coffee went well.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been worried, despite the hopefulness of their conversation in the conservatory, but it had thankfully worked out just fine. They had been honest, and some parts hadn’t easy, but they decided a plan going forward.
    </p>
<p>
     They would still kiss, still hug, hold hands, have their little nicknames, and still say ‘I love you’ (Rio had been very insistent on that and Agatha didn’t argue with her). But they’d pause any talk of marriage or babies, would try not to see each other
     <em>
      every
     </em>
     day, and absolutely, positively
     <em>
      NO
     </em>
     sex. And they were adamant, confident even, that they would have the determination and willpower to see that plan through.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, they were so confident that Agatha asked if she wanted to come say hi to Senõr Scratchy.
    </p>
<p>
     And after her rabbit cuddles, Rio had been confident enough to ask if she could grab a few of her things to take back to her apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     And they were confident enough to both go into the bedroom to collect said items.
    </p>
<p>
     All it took was for them both to reach for the same thing at the same time, and the next thing Rio knew, they were both tangled in the sheets, breathless and grinning like idiots.
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps no sex was an unachievable goal.
    </p>
<p>
     They ended up spending the rest of the week in and out of bed, only really being apart when Rio had to go to classes or the lab. Rio counted that as not being together all the time…right?
    </p>
<p>
     The future, however, was still up in the air. Mostly due to the fact Agatha seemed to be enjoying her unemployment a little too much. Not in the traditional sense of rotting on the couch or doomscrolling TikTok all day. No, no. She had instead channelled her managerial energy into being an active friend, sister, aunt and, most of all, a very devoted girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     That morning, Rio woke to the smell of brewing coffee and pancake batter. She smiled to herself, snuggling against her pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something smells good babe!”
    </p>
<p>
     Soon enough, the bedroom door opened, and Agatha wandered in. Her perfect hair and powerful pantsuits had been replaced with unruly waves and baggy t shirts. Still stunning, just relaxed and totally free.
    </p>
<p>
     The only downside was they were the t shirts Rio liked to steal, but she had discovered her girlfriend had a secret stash of plaid shirts, so had successfully stolen one of those the night before instead. After all, a girlfriend shirt was a girlfriend shirt no matter the style.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood by the side of the bed, smiling down at her. “Good morning, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning,” Rio grinned, still cuddled up in the sheets and the oversized shirt. “What time is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just before eight. I was letting you have a few more minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled up at her. “Why don’t we use those few minutes to cuddle?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “We both know if I get back in that bed, we won’t be leaving it again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds good to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Up. Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled out of bed, quickly running up to press up against Agatha as they walked out of the bedroom. “But we can share a shower, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I already have that in the schedule,” Agatha assured, and Rio grinned. She was quite enjoying this side of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     After breakfast, a
     <em>
      long
     </em>
     shower, and a quick change, Agatha drove Rio to the college.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want me to come pick you up?” she asked as she parked outside the science building.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be fine,” Rio assured. “I’m meeting Alice a few blocks from here, anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her sister had messaged the night before asking if they could meet up. They hadn’t spoken much since the weekend before, and while her sister had looked after her, comforted her, practically scarped her off the metaphorical floor, they hadn’t properly talked. Not about the past, the present, or the future.
    </p>
<p>
     (And if Agatha’s side of the phone calls were anything to go by, Jen didn’t want her friend having anything to do with her, let alone her girlfriend.)
    </p>
<p>
     Baby steps, Rio told herself. It’d all work out somehow. It had to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall I meet you back at my place?” Agatha suggested. “You have your key, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio held searched her backpack and pulled the set out by the silver rabbit. “Good to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Excellent.” Agatha leaned over and placed a soft kiss to her lips. “I’ll see you later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “See you later, my love.” Rio pushed open the car door and climbed out. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I love you.” Agatha smiled, a smile so bright and free that Rio just wanted to climb back into the car and kiss her silly. “Now go before you’re late.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blew her a kiss before rushing up the steps of the science building, a giddy grin on her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha arrived at the Kaplan residence around mid-morning.
    </p>
<p>
     With her husband at work and her son at school, Rebecca always loved it when she had time to stop by during the day, and had been excited when she rang the night before asking if she could swing round the following morning. Only when she got there, Agatha found only one of the Kaplan boys was where they were meant to be.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m ill,” Billy insisted from where he sat at the breakfast table. “I threw up last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatah grimaced. “Gross, kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or so he says.” Rebecca eyed her son suspiciously. “Eitherway, his school has a 24-hour absence policy for sickness, real or not, so here he is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked at his deviousness. “Are you sure he’s your son and not mine?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s all me,” Rebecca insisted, placing a kiss to the top of her son’s head as she walked past him to the fridge. “You’re just a bad influence.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was ill,” Billy insisted once more. “But I’m okay now. Shall we go bowling or something?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely not,” his mother told him. “Now, head upstairs. I want to talk with your aunt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy huffed and sulked his way upstairs. Rebecca waited until they heard his bedroom door slam shut before laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s a terrible liar,” she said as she carried over their coffees. “When he found out you were coming, the whole sickness act started.”
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as he doesn’t make a habit of it. Seeing I’m now unemployed, you’re going to be putting up with me more often.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh great,” Rebecca joked, yet the moment she sat down, her face turned serious. “Have you looked at job vacancies yet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “But I have an editing gig coming through on Monday that’ll give me a bit of extra cash. I’ll just keep trying and networking. Hopefully something will come up, preferably before I run out of rent money.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know if you need to, you have a room here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, but the commute is too long. Also, I’m not doing the medium distance relationship thing. A lesbian trope I am not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, Little Miss U-Haul,” Rebecca teased. “How are things with Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha said with a smile. “We’re taking things slow, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “But?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her head in her hands. “I still want to marry her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You still can! Just let things settle,” Rebecca advised. “You had a big blip, and soon everything will settle down.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not just that. We talked about kids, and I really want us to have that, but I worry the longer we wait the chances of conceiving…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Woah, woah, woah.” Rebecca held her hands up. “Agatha, you don’t have a job. You can’t plan for a kid on top of that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I know.” Agatha sat up and smiled at her sister. “You and Rio are keeping me sane right now. I can’t cope with this lack of routine. Did you know I organised Jen’s calendar for the next year? She said I can come work for her, but I think one of us would get arrested for killing the other.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Especially if she kept on bad-mouthing Rio
     </em>
     , she added in her head. Rebecca didn’t need to know about all that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well you know, family dinner was very much missed here this week. I think next week you should just come here all day. We can do some sister bonding, and I know Billy will be pleased to see you here after school.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds perfect. I’ll see what Rio’s schedule-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Erm, Agatha,” Rebecca interrupted awkwardly. “I think maybe it’d be best if only you came this time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “Why? You said Rio would always be…”
    </p>
<p>
     “That was before,” Rebecca explained. “And before you say anything, I may not know the whole story, but I like Rio and I’m happy you worked things out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?” Agatha leaned back in her chair and folded her arms. “Then what’s the problem?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We thought he’d be as overjoyed as we were when you told us you and Rio had worked things out, but he got upset. He kept saying how he hated her, and how he doesn’t want her coming to the house. We’ve tried to talk to him, but he’s inherited his aunt’s stubbornness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, right, okay.” Agatha got to her feet. “I’ll be right back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are you going?” Rebecca asked as Agatha headed for the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     “To talk to my nephew.”
    </p>
<p>
     When she made it upstairs, she knocked lightly on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come in,” Billy’s voice called out, and Agatha walked inside.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy was sprawled out on his bed, his Switch in his hands. She offered him a warm smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” He set his Switch aside and sat up. “What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down on the edge of his bed. “I talked with your mom, and she said you’re upset about me and Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy looked down at his lap. “I think you could do better.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You loved Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did until she hurt you! If she did it once, she can do it again. I can’t trust her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Billy, you don’t need to worry about that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But…”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” she told him firmly. “I’m a grown adult, Billy. I can make my own decisions.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy scrunched his face and folded his arms; muscle memory from when he was a small child. “I still don’t like her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart dropped sadly. She wanted her two favourite people to be as inseparable as they were before, to see them laughing and joking together. Though it seemed now she’d be lucky to get them just in the same room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well.” Agatha stood back up. “I’ll leave you to whatever ridiculous game you were playing. After all, I have a coffee downstairs getting colder by the moment.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had almost made it out of the door when he piped up again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you angry with me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha answered honestly. Maybe slightly annoyed, but not angry. “I just wish you’d give Rio another chance, but I understand why you’re feeling this way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy nodded in acceptance. “You’re coming for dinner this week, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put on her best smile. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world, kid.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Alice sat opposite each other at the small table in the cramped coffee shop. They both had their coffees, and had exchanged a bit of small talk, but that was all.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t sure what to say. She was scared of saying the wrong thing. What if she just started talking about college and came across too casual? What if she jumped right into it and came across too crass? Then the ridiculousness of her being nervous about trying to talk to her own sister finally sunk in, and so she just said the first thing that popped in her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha told Jen to fuck herself on Wednesday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice almost spat out her drink. “She never told me that!”
    </p>
<p>
     “She did! I heard her shouting from the other room!”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice laughed. “What were they talking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me apparently,” Rio said with a casual shrug, but the fleeting high mood had already dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Rio, just ignore Jen,” Alice insisted. “She’s just defensive and I swear she enjoys arguing with Agatha so will find any excuse to start one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think Agatha enjoys it too,” Rio admitted. “But I get it. What she saw…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wasn’t what happened, and everyone has told her that,” Alice reminded her. “Just leave Jen to me, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have something for you.” Alice reached into her backpack and handed over an envelope.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took it cautiously. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The pages from Mom’s journal. I might find more, but that’ll be the most of it. I figured you should have them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You ripped up Mom’s journal?” Rio held the envelope close, knowing how dangerous and precious its contents was. “Why would you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because some things are more important than dragging up the past.” Alice reached across the table and took Rio’s hand. “No matter what, you’re my sister. I do wish I knew sooner, not so I could judge you but so you had someone to talk to. I can’t imagine how lonely it must have felt carrying a secret like that around with no one else to lean on. But now you have me, Lilia, and of course, Agatha. We’re here for you, always.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio squeezed Alice hand as tears began to pool in her eyes. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And whatever you decide to do with the pages, I’ll support you,” Alice insisted. “Without a doubt.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, as a tear trailed down her cheek. “I love you, Al.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice smiled, her own eyes glistening. “Love you too, sis.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha arrived back at her apartment, she found Rio sat on her living room floor with Scratchy running around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re cleaning up his mess,” she told her. “Whoever gets him out, sorts him out. Those are the house rules.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really?” Rio smirked up at her. “What other rules are there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, to take out the trash whenever you notice it’s full.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a given.” Rio got to her feet. “Anymore?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped towards Rio. “To share the covers equally.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a rule for you, not me,” Rio teased. “But continue.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha brushed a piece of lint off Rio’s shirt, right above her heart. “Whoever makes dinner gets dessert.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cocked an eyebrow. “I better learn how to cook then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And whoever wears the strap, cleans the strap.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What if we both wear one?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “How would that even work?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, but we could try?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed her girlfriend sweetly. “Let’s cuddle on the couch instead.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flopped on the couch and patted the space beside her. “M’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and settled beside her, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. “Did you have a good day?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just yeah?” Agatha teased. “How was Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s good, and we’re good,” Rio said with a smile. “We talked and laughed and cried. It’s what we needed, I think.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh honey, I’m so happy for you.” Agatha linked their arms and squeezed even closer. “And you’re right. Communication is key to any healthy relationship.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that your mantra now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is! I’m considering becoming a motivational speaker.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed loudly. “Please don’t. You’ll make them cry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped dramatically. “I’ll have you know, I give great pep talks! Look at Sharon. Thanks to me, she’s living her bisexual dreams.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s all thanks to Lilia and whatever spell she uses to make herself catnip for women over sixty, and under sometimes.” Rio grimaced. “No, you’d be like one of those body-builder guys who get paid to shout at people until they cry and finally try to improve themselves.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha considered Rio’s words. Perhaps that was a plausible career move?
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could think much into it, Rio reached into the pocket of her hoodie and pulled out a folded envelope. “Alice gave me this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tore open the envelope to reveal a half dozen small pieces of lined paper, all ripped down one edge, covered in fine, spiralling handwriting. Agatha knew what they were instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     “She gave you the pages?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, turning the papers over in her hand. “She said its up to me what I do with them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart beat fast. “And what were you thinking?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I’m not dating you through visitations. If you step foot in a police station…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going to the police,” Rio assured. “I’m not stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you’re not.” Agatha tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “But you’re too honest.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, the only options I’m thinking of are hiding them or burning them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I vote burning!” Agatha went to stand, but Rio dragged her back down.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to think about it, okay? I don’t know if I want to read them, or if I just try to move on. I don’t know.” Rio looked down at the pages, and Agatha could see the struggle in her eyes. “Can we just forget for now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took the papers and tossed them on the floor. “Out of sight, out of mind.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “You’re a menace.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t you know it,” Agatha grinned, until she remembered she had a confession of her own. “Hey, I need to tell you something too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?” Rio looked both curious and concerned. “What’s up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rebecca’s asked me to go round for dinner next week, but just me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” Rio shifted away from her. “Is she mad-”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she’s fine. Really. It’s, well. It’s Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy?” Rio’s eyes widened, and Agatha couldn’t bare the sadness that began to wash over her love’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s just taking it hard,” Agatha assured. “He just needs time, but…you know what? I’m going to call Rebecca and cancel.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? No, Agatha. You can’t cancel! They’re your family!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well you’re my family too,” Agatha insisted. “You’re the person I’m going to marry and have kids with, and that’s something Billy will just have to learn to accept.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her, eyes wide and mouth agape. Agatha realised what she said and kicked herself. So much for taking it slow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I-”
    </p>
<p>
     The next thing she knew, she was on her back with Rio Vidal sprawled on top of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want to marry me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Agatha confirmed. “I really, really do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “I want to marry you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared up at her in awe. “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “So does that make us engaged?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope, I want to ask you properly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, why can’t I ask you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I want to ask you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to ask you too!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not if I want to ask you first!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanna bet, Harkness?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t want to bet me, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned down and kissed her fiercely. Every time they kissed it was magical, but when Rio kissed her like that, Agatha felt like she was floating.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled away, Rio smirked down at her. “Wanna take this show to the bedroom?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slipped out from under her. “Let’s hydrate first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned. “Fuck hydration, Agatha. I’m too wound up for this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Patience my love,” Agatha said as she got to her feet. “Now, let me get us some lemonade.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had almost made it to the kitchen when she heard Rio screech.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whirled round. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned down and picked a shredded piece of paper off the floor. “Scratchy ate the pages!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the mess of nibbled papers surrounding the bunny who was chewing away, once more oblivious to his actions.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried, she really did, but she just couldn’t hold in the laughter bubbling inside her. To her relief, Rio joined her, flopping back on the couch as she burst into giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Senõr Scratchy remained blissfully unaware of the chaos he had just caused, just happy that he was safe in a home filled with love and excitement…and tasty paper too.
