<strong>
      2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha Harkness decides to die is the first day of the rest of her life. Sinking into Rio’s mouth, feeling Death’s tears against her cheeks and the want in her fingertips, Agatha recalls only a strange sense of lightness. The feeling is overpowering. She wishes to feel this kiss, this embrace, this hungry, panting decision, or drown in the sadness of her son, and of Billy, but really. There is only this lightness. Years are being scraped off of her like plaque being cleaned meaninglessly off teeth. Rio’s poison power filtering unbidden into Agatha’s throat, as simple and momentary as cigarette smoke passing from one lover's mouth into the others. And only, instead of the gulping pits of loss, she feels… elation.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha is tired. Her hands on Rio’s face are soft, they are barely holding onto each other, and Rio lets Agatha rise as if she is a balloon, slipping through the fingers of a curious child. Agatha feels Rio watching her, she can only imagine what her love, her Green Witch, her Lady is feeling, and she wants to see her eyes, to return her gaze, but there is only a gentle ebb of gray in Agatha’s vision. A distant roaring in her ears, like thunder. She would call it dizziness if she could.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘Agatha
     </em>
     ,’ a warm voice echoing in her head. ‘
     <em>
      Go gently, my darling
     </em>
     .’
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha exhales. How long has she been holding this breath, down at the bottom of her lungs, trapped under her rib cage? It passes from her lips. It melts tenderly into the ribbons of pitch black Death like snow.
    </p>

<strong>
      1693
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness becomes a murder. Brimming with magic and volatile with pain, she wills herself to move and to not look back. She doesn’t want to see these bodies ever again, she is screaming and weeping and tearing through the forest. But something moves silently through the abandoned grave, collecting souls like leaves of paper. Death hums quietly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1702
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha is washing blood off of her hands the first time she feels herself being watched. The skinned rabbit pelt lies drying by her side, and her thumb is currently working dried flecks of blood out from her nail beds. She sniffs hard and sits up, breath heavy as she looks around.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is nothing. Still, Agatha brings a wet hand to the back of her neck, scratching at the raised hairs. Her intuition has never failed her in her life. To be met with nothing, Agatha knows, is only a sign to be patient.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1709
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness is visited often by the feeling. Most particularly during thunderstorms, full moons, and October. Something about it becomes familiar. She recognizes it more intimately now. She recognizes it as not only a feeling, but also a scent, like dried, crackling leaves dying under a hot autumn sun, and a taste, tangy like red iron-rich soil, and a sound. Always, she hears buzzards.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She has never spoken to her watcher, but Agatha has never been one to deny her amusement. She hums for her shadow, hunting game and deboning fish, whistles, while she brews potions and siphons magic from a handful of crickets into her herb bed. She’s getting better at her magic. Rebuilding her strength with caution, tenderness. Learning the bounds of her power in solitude. And the better she gets… soon. She thinks she will be able to see her shadow soon.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1716
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It is the first time Agatha has killed since she became a murder. The body of the young hunter seems torched beneath her. Agatha pants slowly, deeply, shaking, trying to regain any staggering sense of composure as she holds her heavily bleeding arm. An arrow is lodged into the tree next to her. But the hunter is dead, and the arrows' companions are now strewn on the forest floor next to his body.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘You’re bleeding.’
     </em>
     Buzzard screech. Tangy, iron, the taste of blood in her mouth. Agatha shudders and stands slowly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She wades a slow circle, looking through the trees for the voice echoing in her head. She faces again towards the body and stares down at it in muted shock. There is no power to be siphoned from him. The kill had been made out of fear and instinct. Agatha looks up, and is met with bone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She gasps and falls backwards, scraping herself down the side of the tree. Pain flashes through her arrow-notched arm. She yells out.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The cloaked figure in front of her bends down slowly. A hood obscures their face, but Agatha watches the hand of a skeleton trace feather-light over the mangled, wide-eyed body. The figure straightens, and their hood falls.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stares at a woman. The feeling, standing before her, the stare of her round brown eyes more familiar, more welcoming than any embrace she has ever known.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Who are you?” Agatha whispers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re asking the wrong question, mistress.” Her voice is tougher than it’s bell-like ring in her head. It’s more feminine here, more tangible. Agatha almost believes she could reach out and touch her voice. Touch it with her fingertips, and feel that it is the texture of scales, or ice. “You will not think me a
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     , but a
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Are you a witch?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Of sorts.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blinks slowly, she reaches her hands out towards the standing figure. She is still on her knees, and the earth feels cold under them. The witch approaches Agatha very slowly. There are threads of dark, sparkling green woven into the cloak, like strands of emerald. She takes Agatha’s hands in hers, and they are no longer bone, but actual flesh.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “A green witch,” Agatha asks again. It feels half like she is guessing, and half like she is demanding confirmation. The witch chuckles instead. She walks over the body of the hunter and bends down in front of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re bleeding, mistress. Allow me to help.” Agatha looks down at her hot wound, registers its throb, sees that it runs deeper than she had thought. She cannot heal the wound herself, though could she deny the green witch if she tried?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I demand to know your name first, witch. And I will tell you mine.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The witch smiles. Agatha cannot look away from her face. “I know who you are, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Then I must know your identity even more, if you know mine. Then we will be on equal footing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The witch studies Agatha’s face carefully. She is leaning closer, hovering over Agatha’s legs. There is something not unlike amusement playing across her eyes, but Agatha holds her ground, her jaw clenched, pressing against the back of the tree with all the strength in her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Fae etiquette does not apply to me, nor does it apply to you, spirit witch. But fine, I will humor you. You may call me Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     ,” Agatha whispers. The name in her mouth is ticklish. She wishes to say it again. But it is a half truth, at best. A lie at worst. But there is an intensity about Rio’s energy, something that scares her on a very deep, instinctual level. She feels the urge to run, but not for any reason she can particularly think of, just in the way a rabbit must flee at any heavy footfall. “Th- Then will you heal me or not?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio laughs a soft, deep chuckle. Not humorless and unaffected, but certainly amused in the way indifference always is.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “As you wish, mistress,” Rio whispers lowly in smiling reply.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio climbs atop Agatha, straddling her splayed legs and crawling onto her hips. Involuntary, panicked grunts escape Agatha and she pushes herself further back against the tree, turning her face away and staring at Rio from the corner of her gaze, breath quickening.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hush,” Rio consoles, “I will not hurt you. Be still.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Fighting to gain control over the wild panic absorbed into her, Agatha steadies her breath, whimpering lightly. She is exhausted. Her power had exploded out of her in the surprise of the encounter with the hunter, knocking him dead before his body could even hit the ground, and expending Agatha of the power she had been saving carefully. Combined with the wound, she feels powerless.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pushes Agatha’s patchy coat from her shoulders, ripping the sleeve of her dress off and revealing the babbling gush of thick red blood sliding down her elbow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Taking Agatha’s arm in her hands, Rio levels an unblinking stare at Agatha, who meets it doggedly, braced in preparation for whatever the witch may do to her. But then Rio’s head ducks, and her lips part, and suddenly her tongue is trailing flat against the wound, and Agatha cannot help but release a moan that comes from an entirely unfamiliar part of her, and at the sense of immediate relief that follows she thrashes in shivering delight against the dark, pinning figure of Rio atop her. She bites her lip, a pleasure groan rumbles and dissipates in her throat, and, unable to stand the feeling, wrenches her arm out of Rio’s grasp.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moment she does this, however, Rio strikes out and pulls Agatha forward by the collar of her shirt, their faces centimeters apart, only to push her down into the grass. Agatha lands with an oof, reeling from the whiplash while Rio takes the opportunity to pin both of Agatha’s wrists in her hands.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What are you?” Agatha screams, jerking in vain trying to escape Rio’s grip.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “An observer,” is Rio’s simple answer. “But ultimately, your destiny.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My… destiny?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s face inches closer. Her mouth hovers above Agatha’s. She licks her lips. “Yes, Agatha. Your destiny, your fate, your future. Whatever you wish to call it. Yours. Soon, my mistress.” She deftly averts her lips meeting Agatha’s only to press a light, trailing kiss against Agatha’s neck. Her eyes fall shut, she inhales sharply, her hips rock, and ankles dig into the dirt, and when she opens her eyes, Rio is gone.
    </p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1721
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A coven of wide-eyed witches at her feet. Agatha’s hands, brimming with power. Her blood brimming with power. A shocked smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘I
     </em>
<em>
      wasn’t sure you had it in you
     </em>
     .’
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha has been waiting for her. She’s prepared.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I was. And I do.” Her fist curls into itself, laced with tendrils of purple. She looks around slowly, scanning for Rio. “I figured you out, green witch.” Agatha calls out steadily, searchingly. Opposite her the ring of fallen witches, Rio appears. A spring green robe volante over a whale bone corset, her emerald black cloak.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Good afternoon,” Rio bows. “I’ve dressed up for you. What do you think?” She swings the hoop of the dress in an almost girlish manner, looking playfully up at Agatha beneath dark eyelashes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Does Death need be so elegantly dressed to escort these fine souls to the afterlife?” Agatha says, eyeing Rio warily though with a sharp firmness in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s face doesn’t seem to change. She bends down to study the body in front of her. The corpse is leached of all life, of all energy, a gray husk wrinkled like a raisin in the sun.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Uncanny,” Rio says aloud, seemingly to herself. She looks up at Agatha from her place squatted in front of the body and Agatha stifles her gasp. Two bright brown eyes blinking at her from behind a skull, a smiling and placid look on her skeletal face. She looks back down, and the moment is gone. Agatha swallows grimly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Why are you here?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands. She looks around at the bodies. “Take a gander, mistress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re just here for these bodies? Then why reveal yourself to me?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio tips her head. Her eyes trace up and down Agatha. She wonders if she is being hunted. She swallows. She blinks. When she opens her eyes, Death is inches from her face. Agatha gasps and startles backwards, but Rio wraps a hand around her waist to keep from falling. With a yell, Agatha pushes her back, her fingers misting with purple, and Rio takes her wrists in her hands, tutting softly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “None of that here, mistress. You have already caused enough damage for the decade, wouldn’t you say?” She releases Agatha, who stumbles backwards, barely catching her footing and panting.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Decade?” she manages, her voice wavering. “This will last me to the next century.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death giggles. “Must I wait that long to see you once more?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You have found me anyway, haven’t you? You are my shadow. I have always felt your gaze.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is a quietness between them. Rio’s eyes narrow. “Yes. I have watched you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The admittance is far more vulnerable than Agatha can bear. “And I have sung to you, whenever I have felt your eyes upon me.” Rio says nothing. She just blinks, and watches. Agatha straightens her gown and fixes her hair. She feels like she is glowing. She feels radiant. The power in her blood, just underneath her skin. Boiling her alive. “Why is it then? That you follow me? Is it because I’ve cheated you, and you are waiting for the chance to strike down my mortal soul?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha feels like prey. It is that feeling again. That fear. She is powerful. She is not
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     powerful, to be standing in front of Death and taunting her. But she will anyway, she is Agatha Harkness after all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio seems to know this. The same amused, knowing smile hangs on her lips. “You have not cheated me, witch. You will age, preserved in your eternal beauty, like all semi-immortals. You are not the first of your kind. And yet,” she gestures to the strew of bodies. “This beautiful display is… impossible to stay away from.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You needn’t reveal yourself to me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Don’t I?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Agatha crosses her arms, glowering. A put together composer, despite the fear tracing delicately down her spine. “You must want something from me. A deal.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio tosses her head back and laughs. It is eerie. Agatha’s heart squeezes. “Death does not make deals, foolish witch,” Rio growls, green power flashing across her eyes like those of a cat in the night. “You forget yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Then remind me of my place,” Agatha says, exasperated at the lack of answers she has been able to find for herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death approaches Agatha slowly. Agatha stands still, though she is sure that her breath gives away her uncertainty. Her fear. Death reaches a slow hand up and Agatha goes rigid as she strokes her fingertips across Agatha’s eyebrow, her cheek, under her chin. “I find you beautiful, spirit witch.” Agatha’s breath leaves her. What? In the ache of silence, Rio twirls a strand of Agatha’s hair around her finger. “Do you not find me beautiful? You have left me all these presents.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I…” Agatha fumbles for words. Her eyes trace Rio’s face. The plush of her lips, the tender sharpness of her eyes. She comes up with nothing. What could she say? What was there to say?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I see,” Rio whispers. She brings Agatha’s hand to her mouth, her lips brushing her knuckles. “Te veo, mistress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And then she is gone. Agatha’s hand still hanging limply in the air. The brush of Death’s lips like a burn against her skin. “Wait,” she says quietly, but Rio has vanished.

<blockquote>
<p>
      writing for this fandom where there is a sense of reverse dramatic irony where the characters know so much more than the audience, i’ve noticed that it’s like doing a fill-in-the-blank test except you have all the answers in their places and need to draw up the context around it. it’s like putting together puzzle pieces, you have the final picture and just need to fit the pieces and find it.
     </p>
<p>
      i’m doing my absolute best to make it as close to what i think these characters would say bc i got sick of reading fanfiction and agonizing over how true it sounded to the source material. writing what i wanna read lmfao

     There are really no rituals to summon Death incarnate. Agatha reads every spell book she can find, searches for the face she sees in her dreams, and comes up empty. There are akin spells, one to summon a nearby green witch, one to stitch yourself momentarily in the spirit world, one to send a confession to anyone you can imagine.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But confess what? Agatha supposes she could call out, but she cannot. It is undignified. What if she didn’t come? But she thinks of her, and thinks of her, and thinks of her, and
     <em>
      dreams
     </em>
     of her (
     <em>
      God,
     </em>
     these
     <em>
      dreams
     </em>
     ) running herself around in useless circles and coming up empty-handed as to a real reason to see her. She has nothing to say. No words to put to the confusing whirl of emotions. The dual heat and ice, the enchantment and the fear, the…
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Sure. The want. Why not? Agatha
     <em>
      wants
     </em>
     to see Rio. There is nothing more to it than that.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     So. She divinates. She steals from pieces of each spell. Black string, green candles etched with runes and dripping with frankincense, four dead corvids, the skull of a buck. Bay leaves, lavender, a secluded spot in the woods, a pool of moonlight. Fire.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And Agatha, on her knees in front of it all, holding two black stones in each hand.
     <em>
      ‘Quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
     ,’ she whispers. Her body jerks with magic, her eyes close.
     <em>
      ‘Quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
<em>
      quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
<em>
      quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
<em>
      quaerite-
     </em>
     ’ the cracking of bones, a gust of wind, the forceful tug of magic on Agatha and she yells and is pushed down into the dirt, she is on all fours, her hair caught in her mouth, ‘
     <em>
      Quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
     ,’ the ground quivers, the dirt moans, Agatha pants into the dead leaves beneath her,
     <em>
      ‘Quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
     ,’ the earth erupts, splits, a figure rising from it, the skull lifting under mountaining dirt, rattling, the roots and beetles twist into shape, arms, bones splintering,
     <em>
      ‘Quaerite me quaerentem te
     </em>
     ,’ the figure screeches and Agatha covers her ears, squeezes her eyes shut, murmurs the spell over and over,
     <em>
      ‘seek me as I seek you,’
     </em>
     and then a final burst of magic empties from her and she straightens on her knees, convulsing with agony of it, and-
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A black figure, robed in dirt, face hidden underneath the buck skull. It tilts its head to the side, the antlers tipping down. Agatha pants, shaking, squinting through the nighttime.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Good evening, mistress.” Agatha collapses to the ground. On her back, she stares up at the leafy rooftop, watching the moonlight cut through it. Antlers, starchy white, the black figure in the skull leans hauntingly over Agatha. “Boo.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hello, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness is pretty sure there are rules warning against inviting immortal deities into your home, but in her cottage, she brews tea while making Rio stand outside and shake dirt off of herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “There were easier ways to get my attention, mistress.” Rio calls into the house as she bats away the dirt. “Ways that did not require such… unagreeable methods.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha fills two cups with tea. “I thought the skull was a nice touch,” she replies. Rio steps through the door. The lights flicker. Rio raises her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Are these wards for me?” she asks playfully, but Agatha can see the crack of truth in it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She swallows heavily. In truth, the wards
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     for her. In part, anyways. Agatha has been dreaming. Almost every night she dreams. She dreams of Rio, of green tendrils of magic, of a black cloak, of fingertips, of lips, and every morning she wakes up gasping, cold with sweat, her sheets wet, her clothes partially on, or not on at all. The wards were to keep the dreams away. A sort of test. If they worked, it meant the dreams were being sent to her. And if they didn’t, then perhaps a spell had been placed on Agatha, or a curse. Or, that the dreams were merely her dreams.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The ward had partially worked. Often she didn’t remember her recent dreams, or could wake herself up from them, or recover a bit of lucidity whilst in them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha scowles. “You know what you’ve done.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do I?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio takes her cloak off politely, hangs it up. Her gown is black and depressed, the hoop skirt broken and abandoned in the summoning, the fabric tattered and dirty. She is a mess, and she doesn’t seem to mind but for Agatha’s minding.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Of course you do,” Agatha hisses. “My- My dreams?” She wills the heat in her face away. Rio sits on a chair opposite Agatha and says nothing. Her face gives away even less.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What happens in your dreams, mistress?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands abruptly. “And who are you to be calling me by such a name?” Rio shrugs her unaffected shrug, smiling up at Agatha. “If anything,” Agatha paces around the room, “am I not the one who is supposed to call you mistress, my Lady Death?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Be my guest,” Death purrs. A horrid chill trickles down Agatha’s spine, accompanied by an even worse ache of heat in her stomach. Agatha scoffs and whirls away with a flourish. In the kitchen, she pats herself with a cold towel. She returns carrying a plate of bread and apples.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio is studying Agatha’s cottage when she sits back down. “Do I frighten you, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Yes.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You are Death incarnate. You are the most powerful creature I will ever meet. You thread yourself between the stitches of time. You wait for nobody, and nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And you are scared of me?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She could respond with yes. Maybe it is even what Lady Death wishes to hear. Her eloquent preamble didn’t seem to do the trick. But there is only partial truth in answering the affirmative. Agatha is scared of Rio, but not in her heart, and not in her head. She is scared in the fabric of her being. She is scared in her fingertips and the ends of her hair. It is fear, but it is not
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     fear. It does not belong to Agatha’s senses. It is the overpowering urge of instinct. But instinct can be tamed, with a firm mind and a steady heart.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I do not know if I can trust you,” Agatha settles with saying. She can tame the wild thrill of instinct, but should she?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The response is blunt.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Of course you cannot. You said it yourself. I wait for nobody, and nothing. My power is limitless, and I am the puppet it summons onto the mortal plane.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What are you saying?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “If I cannot trust myself, then how can you?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It is the saddest thing Rio could have said in this moment, but her features betray none of its emotion. She says it as if it is the simplest of facts and the most whole and undeniable truth.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Unsure how to proceed, Agatha gestures to the bread. “Will you eat?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will not.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha manages a half-hearted smile. “I believe
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     are the one that dismissed faery etiquette between us. You may eat safely.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiles, but does not make a move to touch the plate of food.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is a pregnant pause, and Agatha finds herself holding her breath. There is a pressure on the back of her neck, she has many questions, and none of the will to ask them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands. “Perhaps it is best if I leave you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands abruptly. “After all the work it took to summon you here?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I said it before, you could have asked.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And you could have come anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A tense and sharp silence, like a blade falling through air between them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And why,” Rio asks quietly, “
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     you bring me here?” Agatha clenches her jaw. She looks to the side, then the floor, her gaze flickering everywhere but on Death before her. In the silence, Rio tilts her head softly. “What do you dream about, my dear?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha exhales a shaky breath. “If I tell you, you will not leave again?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Something in Rio’s features cracks. There is a small, impossible moment of sadness (or maybe surprise?) in her eyes, and then it is gone, leaving only solemnity in its wake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will not leave, Agatha. Unless you wish me to.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart beats fast. Too fast. Her breath is uncontrollable and shaky. Her head is light.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I dream…” her voice cracks and she swallows, shaking her head. “I dream of you, my Lady.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You dream of me,” Rio echoes. She takes a small step forward.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I dream of… of you in the woods. Or in my cottage. Or… anywhere really. Sometimes you look like… like Death. And sometimes as you do now.” Agatha pauses, waiting for Rio to intercede, but she merely nods her head for Agatha to continue. “You don’t- don’t say anything. You don’t need to. I can hear your heart beating. I can hear it beating for me.” Rio takes a quick step forward in a manner that makes it seem almost involuntary. Agatha flinches but remains rooted in place. “You… sometimes. Sometimes you-” her cheeks burn, “sometimes you circle me without touching me.” In these dreams she orders Agatha to strip her clothes while she watches. “Sometimes you,” she looks at the ceiling, “kiss me. Sometimes, I kiss you. Sometimes you undo my corset. You lead me to my bed. Or I lay you down on the foliage. Sometimes it is a nightmare, all teeth and blood.” Those feel the best. “In my dreams, you touch me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And you think I sent you these dreams?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Embarrassment flares in Agatha’s chest and she takes a deep, unsteady breath. Under her clothes, she burns. She must stand absolutely still. She does not know what will happen if she moves.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The wards… I was testing in case you did.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And what did you find?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head slowly. “I do not know.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio steps closer. Their faces, closer. Agatha stares unabashedly, even uncontrollably at Rio’s mouth, flicking around her eyes, looking at her neck, her collarbones, her ears.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Would you like me to have sent you these… dreams, mistress?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s chest feels near to burst, her ears burning, halfway to seeing double, lurid. “What,” she breathes, “What sort of spell are you putting on me?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “There is no spell,” Rio whispers. She takes a step closer, places her hands on Agatha’s hips, the touch is light but Agatha exhales shakily. “It is just us, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No, no I -” Rio closes the distance between them, her mouth crushing against Agatha’s, pulling her waist tight against her body. Agatha yelps, though it is muffled against Rio’s mouth, and she tries to push her away, only to find her strength failing her, Rio’s hold on her tight.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her body submits a bit, loosening under Rio’s hands, inviting her to take more, to push harder. And she does. Agatha takes a few harried steps backwards, Rio chasing into her. Rio’s hands knead into Agatha’s hair, eliciting a moan from her throat before she is yanked away.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Your dreams, mistress. Your bed?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Even in her dreams, Agatha Harkness is not one to submit easily, ever. She prefers control, but fighting this, here,
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     , seems futile. She has been nothing but persistent from the moment she swept into Agatha’s life. What can she do but want? And she does. Want. Rio’s fingernails digging into her skull, the brazen touch of her lips, it was barely even a kiss, just means to an end, just a desire, a need of sorts, but her? Her of all people, to be so coveted by Death?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio is looking at her, her lips parted, that familiar glower, the lust in her eyes, lust on her tongue, lust buzzing in her fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha submits.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Without breaking her gaze from Rio’s, she takes Death’s hands in her own, leading her backwards. Agatha maneuvers to her bed, Rio advancing upon her, a small smile of triumph on her mouth. The backs of her legs hit the soft cushion. Agatha breaks away from Rio’s gaze to look behind her at the bed, and the moment she does she is pushed down.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wastes no time climbing on top of her, a tangle of cloth, of dress fabric, Rio’s hand gripping Agatha’s chin, her tongue in her throat, her rumbling moans. Agatha’s hands climb Rio’s back, attempting to unlace the corset before Rio’s mouth moves to her neck, and she bites down over her pulse. Agatha groans, her back arching, and before she can stop herself, magic spills from her fingertips and rips down the bodice of Rio’s dress and Agatha’s hands find her bared back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death shudders into a chuckle against Agatha’s skin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m glad to see you so eager, mistress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’d be gladder to see you out of this dress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio leans up, and Agatha takes the opportunity to flip her over. She prefers this. Her heart thrums heavily, and she feels hot beneath her stomach, a dense feeling burning under skin. And Rio, under her, an impish smile playing across her lips, one eyebrow arched softly. Agatha kisses her. Slowly and deeply, Rio seems to be drinking her in, it is almost consuming, yet Agatha feels all the more powerful. She rids Rio of her ruined dress, her hands on her ribs, her breasts, her sides and her stomach, enjoying her jolting writhe, marveling because she didn’t know that Death could be this warm, could have such a sweet whimper against her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha’s hands find Rio’s thighs, fingers crawling high, teasing and light, she tosses her head back, toes curling eagerly, and Agatha is half smiling and half awed, and then is touching her, wet and warm, curling inside of her, inhaling each of Rio’s moans and curses and gasps, other hand holding her down, her flinching and wild body, she is so tangible, she smells like comfort.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio sobs, and then with a yell and a burst of black spooling magic, Agatha finds herself ripped off of the warm body of Death, crashing belly-up on the bed, the frightening, shadowy magic curling around the both of them, strapping Agatha down onto the mattress, a slight convulsion to Rio’s form as she impatiently straddles Agatha’s waist. Pushing up Agatha’s skirts, she grinds herself onto Agatha’s thigh, and Agatha can only watch in furious impatience, fighting the bounds of magic, as Rio whimpers, tosses her head back, her two palms pressing down into Agatha as she rocks into her, wet, so wet, dripping down Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio bites her lip, smiling down at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No fun,” Agatha pants, her hips bucking. “You could at least help me out of my garments, my Lady Death.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio leans down, hovering tantalizingly over Agatha’s mouth, laughing lightly. “I wished to take you without rush.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re the one-” Rio bites Agatha’s ear, drawing blood, beckoning a groan, “the one rushing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio kisses Agatha, blood on her lips like a brilliant rouge, Agatha moans at the tang, it’s familiar, it reminds her of Rio, when Rio was only a shadow, was only the audience of a solemn song.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I wished to see you at my mercy.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Should I be frightened?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I wished for you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The black tendrils tear achingly at Agatha’s dress and she shudders at each desperate rip, each tingling slide of dark magic under her skirts, against her thighs. Her breath hitches fitfully, and then the corset loosens, snaps, the magic recedes, replaced by Rio’s mouth on her, everywhere on her, tongue sliding, lips bruising, teeth ripping at her flesh, she knows there is blood, she knows she is smeared with it, and all she feels is Rio, is Death’s sandy magic twisting around them, all of her pleasure and power.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio moves, crawling, up Agatha. “I like that you’ve watched me,” Agatha murmurs, her eyes on Rio’s as she inches closer to her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio presses herself against Agatha’s mouth and moans, muting her, riding her tongue, her mouth. “I have watched you,” she hisses, nails scraping up Agatha’s stomach, breaking skin in her wake. “I don’t know what you dream, but I watch you sleep.” Agatha moans inconsolably, lapping, delirious, scratching Rio’s back, ass, claw marks down her thighs, beads of blood under her fingernails. “I watch you and think about this.” She punctuates with a head toss, humming, panting, whimpering, Agatha’s fingers against her clit, thighs squeezing tightly, shivering into an orgasm, cursing under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She falls down atop Agatha, laying above her, her knee between Agatha’s thighs, groaning softly as her hands flutter down Agatha’s stomach, playing against her folds.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha whimpers and Rio pins her wrists together above her head. “How does this feel, lovely witch?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha exhales, eyes fallen shut, “Keep going.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Anything for you,” is the whispered reply.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please,” she says.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Of course,” she replies.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “More.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio obliges.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes,” says Agatha. “Yes, yes, yes.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio is gone the next morning, a few crow feathers drifting down into the sheet the moment Agatha opens her eyes, listening to the murmured promise of return faint in the air like dust.

<strong>
      1726, April
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sweeps cinnamon through her living room. The days inch pervasively into nighttime. She hates the summer solstice, and treats spring time as kindly as she can. Orange peels sit on her sills, bunches of dried lavender hang from her ceiling, she wraps her hair, long and thick and dark, in a headscarf. Wind chimes clatter gently outside, and then stop.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pauses, straightens, and feels for a breeze that does not come.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A buzzard cries, distant. Agatha turns around.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My Lady,” she says softly, bowing her head to the pale figure of Death appeared in her doorway. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s hair is braided down her back, and in brown leather, belted around the waist of her soft green dress, swing bundles of dogwood and thyme. She holds a bouquet of daffodils.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Tis my off season,” Death replies. “I’ve come to wish you a merry Ostara.” She offers the flowers, smiling.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Carefully, Agatha approaches. “I’m not particularly celebratory.” She takes the daffodils, smells them. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turns to bring them inside. Rio lingers. “Will you invite me past your wards, mistress?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looks over her shoulder, blinking innocently. “What wards?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio chuckles darkly and steps inside. The moment Death has crossed her door, Agatha feels a familiar chill trickle across her skin, a certain breathlessness. She inhales steadily, heat curls in her stomach, and swallows hard to calm herself before facing Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Why have you come, without summons?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death follows a stream of sun alighting a square on Agatha’s floor. “In the season of warmth,” she says distractedly, “I found the sun to be lacking.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath catches. She returns to her broom. “It is a cold spring we are having,” she replies evenly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A soft whoosh, a hard wind against Agatha’s back, and then she feels Rio’s breath on the back of her neck, a pool of black dissolving quickly under her feet. A quiet whimper as Rio’s fingertips flit up her sides, twisting the hair at her nape that has escaped from the head scarf.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha turns around, and Rio kisses her severely the moment they meet face to face. “You haven’t summoned me,” Rio whispers against her mouth. Agatha sighs into the kiss, her hands cupping Rio’s face, dragging lightly down her sternum.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The side of Rio’s nose pressed against Agatha’s, their foreheads touching, heavy breaths, “Have you been waiting for me?” Agatha whispers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have been waiting.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “For too long, dear?” Agatha mocks, Rio humming gently against her neck, nibbling, tasting, testing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do you find me impatient?” Rio’s hands push the sleeves off of Agatha’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I find you,” a tug, a breast exposed, Rio’s mouth, hot and wet around her nipple, Agatha’s moans soft and throaty, “whetted.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looks down, her eyes catching Rio’s, and she swallows, the back of one hand rising to her mouth as Death sinks to her knees in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I think you’ll find me quite wet indeed, my mistress,” she says calmly, her hands grabbing testingly at the hem of Agatha’s dress. Agatha’s hands dig into Rio’s hair, without hesitation she yanks the dress down the length of Agatha’s body, leaving it a cottony puddle around her feet. Rio hums in pleasure, her palms skimming up Agatha’s thighs, tongue up her navel.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha tugs Rio’s hair sharply, eliciting a dark, smiling gasp from her as she faces towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha says haughtily. She steps, naked, out of Rio’s reach. “We will break fast.” She pulls her hair from her head scarf, and Rio watches with a taut smile and glimmering eyes as Agatha’s hair spills down her back, over her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Will we?” Rio whispers tensely, standing slowly, eyes unmoving from Agatha, hungry.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’ve baked a grain bread. I have butter. Berries grow outside. We will drink tea.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “May I ask why, my mistress?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pauses, already holding the loaf on her board, the sweep of her hair as she cocks backwards brushing against her breasts. Rio licks her lips. “No, you may not.” She spins back. “Berries. You will make haste.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands outside Agatha’s window, watching her set up their dishes and bread, making tea, spooning out butter. She lazily picks berries off of Agatha’s bush and tucks them between her teeth, watching. A sort of frustrated amusement. She seems up to no good, Agatha thinks, prancing naked around her house with a bread knife in one hand and a steaming kettle in the other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I admit to appreciating this view,” Rio drawls, leaning into the window, though a tense twinge in her voice hints impatience and Agatha smiles, meandering, reticent, flaunting.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Is there a ‘but’, dearest?” Agatha pulls her hair over one shoulder. Rio squishes a red berry in her fingertips. She beckons Agatha to the window, chasing at her heels with nipping sheets of black. Leaning on her palms, Agatha takes Rio’s berry-stained fingers in her mouth, sucking the juice and seeds from her skin. Their eyes linger intently on each other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Come,” Agatha commands. She pulls out her chair and sits, waving impatiently for Rio to join her. With an intense pause, Rio disappears and reappears in the opposite chair in a flourish of implosive black magic. In the sheaths of sunlight she sees the black wisps woven with violet and emerald, crow feathers, tourmaline. “My Lady Death seems to be… appetent today.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Perhaps she is.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I see. Well, she has come quite without invite, one mustn’t misremember.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “She felt welcome enough.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My reaper can be particularly convincing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands abruptly, pacing slowly forward and grabbing Agatha’s jaw, forcing her to meet her eyes. The other grabs the back of Agatha’s chair, rattling it with the force of her movement. “Not convincing enough, apparently,” she hisses.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grips two hands on Rio’s wrist, clearing her throat carefully. “Don’t tell me I have offended you,” she coughs, “my Lady.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Be obliging to your guest and lay down, mistress. I starve, and you are ripe for the picking.” Agatha only laughs in reply.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio forces Agatha to her feet, her body taut at Rio’s arm length. With an awful strength, Rio pushes Agatha the distance of a few paces, crashing her back-first on the bed, Agatha a kicking and scratching flurry of blankets and abrupt, howling yells.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moment Rio’s hand leaves Agatha’s throat, purple magic sweeps into Rio, pulling her like a drowning tide beneath Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio only grins, “This is more like it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Happy we agree,” Agatha says, her magic ripping swiftly through Death’s dress and shedding it to the floor as Agatha bites down on Rio’s bottom lip. “I waited for you too,” she whispers against Rio’s mouth. Blood on her lips, staining her teeth. Hands between legs, Agatha’s lips pressed against Death’s ear, “I still dream, do you still watch?” a hand covering Rio’s mouth before she can answer, an offended grunt, “Have you been watching the times I've gone to bed in nothing at all?” Fingers in Rio’s shuddering body, she writhes and bucks with the rage of a predator, hackles and sharp points and throaty growls. “When I’ve touched myself before I sleep, or when I wake up in the middle of the night and I can swear I smell you on the air?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio twists over and Agatha narrowly dodges getting kicked in the side of the head. Agatha falls on her fours over Rio, now on her stomach, hands callously exploring, rude and greedily. Rio arches into the mattress, Agatha’s fingers fill her deeper, and Rio tears open the pillow with her teeth, sending downy feathers exploding to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “How destructive,” Agatha murmurs into Rio’s hair, biting at her nape, knowing, or perhaps just realizing, she could never truly hurt Death incarnate but toeing the line anyway. She seems inhuman, nails clawing through the bedding, skin flinching at Agatha’s mouth, all groans and throaty laughs and severe arches and angles.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha holds the back of her neck, pushing Rio’s face into the mattress, continuing fucking her with the other, almost leashing her. When Rio snarls into orgasm, Agatha watches, concentrated, smiling, her mouth slightly open, “ahh ahh,” she purrs, consoling, urging softly. Every strained muscle in Death’s body loosens, and she turns, her back sinking softly into the cacophony of quilt and cotton and feather, Agatha humming affirmatively, kissing her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Lovely,” Agatha sings. She kisses Rio’s collarbones while she pants, still and shivering. Death’s hands pull Agatha down on top of her. She flinches at it, at the tenderness of two bared bodies pressed together, being held and holding, and Rio buries her face into Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Ah.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The thought erupts in Agatha’s mind, a burst of crow calls and feathers, like a stone thrown through the middle of a peaceful flock.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My Lady,” Agatha whispers, kissing Death’s cheek. Rio sighs and turns her face into Agatha’s. They kiss. “My Lady,” Agatha murmurs, “I wish to fetch you water, but I fear you will not be here when I return.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pulls Agatha closer into her, hands demanding, almost pathetic. Soft and malleable. “Then stay.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Will you find me again soon?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Stay, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha kisses Rio’s temple. “I will stay.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The day will pass without us.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Let it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’ve ruined my bed. And another dress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio hums. Her fingers dig into Agatha’s shoulder blades.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I see,” Agatha takes Rio in her palms, where she is soft, and feels for her pulse, “I understand.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And she does. Crow feathers fall in her mind's eye. They settle so gently amongst the grass. Rio is falling in love with Agatha Harkness, perhaps already has. Death chooses a mortal. Agatha kisses Rio’s hairline. She understands that she does not have to be alone. There is a choice before her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m here,” says Agatha. “I am staying.”

<strong>
      1729, June
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio has stayed. She comes and goes but, always, she stays. She leaves something behind, every time. Jewelry, herbs, furs, dresses, spices.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alone, Agatha snuffs out her candles. She sits in the darkness for a moment, listening to crickets.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She braids her hair. She goes to bed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And she wakes up with a gasp, sitting straight up, drenched in sweat, floundering for the edges of a nightmare already receding. Two arms reach from the darkness, enveloping Agatha. She screams, and a palm covers her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hush,” Death whispers into Agatha’s ear, her warm breath a caress. Agatha groans and puts a hand to her heart, desperate to calm her breathing. “I took the nightmare from you,” Rio says. Agatha scrambles for the dream, but it is already gone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t…” her voice quivers and Agatha inhales sharply, deeply, steadying herself, “that was not your place.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” the faceless voice replies, “it was hurting you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighs shakily, her breaths evening out. Her head falls back against Rio’s shoulder, her eyes closed. “It always does,” she whispers into the dark.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1733, January
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers bury themselves into Rio’s scalp, her head fallen back, long tresses of hair spilling down between her shoulder blades. Between her legs, Rio looks unflinchingly at Agatha, who is splayed out atop the dinner table between plates of half eaten food.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her back arches suddenly, a silent gasp trapped in her throat, fingernails digging painfully into Rio’s head. Her back lands abruptly down on the table, and she pushes a plate to hear the crash.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio whispers, climbing up on the table, naked save for the white flower petals scattered in her hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Mmm,” Agatha hums in reply, her eyes closed, arms stretching out in a soft delight. She pushes another plate off of the table.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I haven’t finished with you yet.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1736, September
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The sun sets into an orange wood, a veil of fog burning yellow within the forest. Agatha stalks quietly through the trees, a basket full of mushrooms and herbs sitting in the crook of her elbow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She lazily approaches a stream, watching the orange fade defeatedly into a haze of pink and purple, shadows tangled in the babbling of the water. She sets the basket down and drops slowly to her knees. She takes a handful of water and brings it to her lips.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands and reaches down. Her fingers grasp at air. When Agatha looks, she realizes with a disapproving hum that her carefully curated basket has vanished.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is a soft giggle in the air. The smell of dead leaves, though the forest still retains its summery green hue.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha narrows her eyes and scans the forest. A crow call, a buzzard screech. A whoosh of wind, Agatha whips around and the basket is thrown haphazardly at her chest. Agatha barely manages to catch it, and not without spilling a few mushrooms. Rio stands, highlighted in the chromatic scene, wearing a dark dress and long gloves, her cloak fluttering around her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You dropped something, mistress,” Rio says, smiling.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pauses, thinking of how to respond. She opens her mouth, closes it, and then takes off running through the forest, her laugh echoing into the tree tops.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death’s eyes widen, and she stands for a minute, contemplating, before vanishing in a whirl of shadow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha tears between the trees, checking over her shoulder, a flick of her hands kicking up walls of leaves behind her and tangling together the roots of the trees. She laughs in delight, checking her other shoulder, and seeing Rio matching her pace yards to her right, watching Agatha with unblinking intensity.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha whoops out loud, and shoots her magic in front of Rio’s feet. But Death is nimble and acute, jumping the moment the blast lands and disappearing into the air in a soft cloud of black sand.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her cottage is within eyesight. Agatha pants and runs, excitement buzzing in her head, the door getting closer and closer, and she is suddenly wrenched into the air and then back, and arms wrap around her. She is yanked up by the waist, tossed over Rio’s shoulder, and watches the distance to her cottage grow longer again. Agatha bites her lip and squints, throwing herself backwards, her legs catching Rio’s head, and she falls, bringing the both of them down with her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The two scramble upright, purple magic humming in Agatha’s outstretched hand, and black tendrils curling, cat-like, around Rio. Agatha pants heavily, and Rio watches, faintly smiling, her tongue swiping through the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     With a loud groan, Agatha falls onto her back, defeatedly withdrawing her magic. Rio chuckles and collapses onto her back. The two of them stare at treetops, silent, just listening to heavy breaths between them, the chatter of squirrels, and the last few whistles of dying cicadas. Soon, she will stop aging. She can feel it. She likes herself here. Now. And with her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1745, March
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha listens to the sound of Rio humming in her kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Naked, she leans in her doorway, sipping tea, feeling the ache of muddy spring, wet and cold against her body.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My love,” Agatha calls softly. A wisp of black sand, air against her bare skin, and then hands on her hips, around her waist.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Soon.” Agatha whispers. Rio hums, mouth in the crook of her neck. “Soon, we will walk the Road.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Silence. Then a light laugh. “I look forward to our adventure, mistress.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1745, August
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In an already miserable heat, Agatha falls ill. Cursing to herself, she greedily drinks down water, swallows garlic, and tucks yarrow under her tongue before retreating to bed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She feels frail and vulnerable, too much so to sleep nude tonight, and in an itchy sleep gown she lays still atop all her blankets, window open, beckoning for a non-existent wind, and an even less becoming chill. The chill, instead, seems to creep into Agatha’s bones. She shivers and tosses, panting, in bed. She slides under her covers, and then kicks off the quilts. She falls, into a restless and trapping sleep.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In her dreams, she is a girl by a pond. Her fingertips trace her wavering reflection. She whispers incantations, and watches her magic float lazily into the water, the consistency of blood. A bubble pops at the surface, and suddenly a fish floats to the top, belly up. Agatha retracts her hand from the water. Another fish floats up next to it, its lifeless eye meeting Agatha’s. The surface breaks as another fish comes up dead, and then another, and another, and Agatha stands and staggers backwards, gasping as the surface of the pond rapidly becomes contaminated with the corpses of minnows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In her bed, Agatha grunts and exhales, flipping onto her stomach and her back, her hair sticking to her clammy skin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And in her dreams, she is tied to a stake, and she hears fire but can see nothing. She only knows there must be someone there, and she now not only hears the cracking of fire but smells it, and then suddenly she feels its heat, close to her, closer. She screams, tries opening her eyes but they
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     open, and she is truly blind, fighting against her restraints, feeling splinters break into her hands and her back, the heat of the fire growing closer and closer.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her screams dissolve into begs, incoherent pleas, she cannot move, there’s a pop of firewood, and the blaze catches beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shrieks awake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1745, Hallows Eve
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You were lovely.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death winds between witches, between bodies, and Agatha shakes her cloak from her shoulders. “You
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     lovely,” Rio adds. Agatha glows, tall, teeming, seeming to be full of moonlight.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do you enjoy your gifts?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You are the most enchanting body here.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hums, distracted suddenly. She sheds her cloak and gloves. Blackened fingertips, stained to her knuckles. “That’s new.” A dull heat aches at the base of her throat. There’s a ringing in her ears.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death, skeletal, teeth and jaws, dread, beauty, faces opposite Agatha, raising one of the blackened hands to her lips. “There are always prices.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha turns her back to Rio quickly, clutching at her collar. “Have I not paid the price already?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death laughs, and it echoes, ripples through the hallow. “Advice, my love.” She is in front of Agatha once more, unavoidable, looming, Agatha’s mouth tugs into a frown. “Reaping is gain.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pauses. “What does that mean?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “To reap is to take, and to take is to gain.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     does that mean?” There is an awful edge to Agatha’s voice. Rio tilts her head softly, eyes steady on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The Darkhold.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Obviously.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The Darkhold does not care for the pain you have sacrificed for it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart burns, agitated, in her chest. Her new power feels itchy. She rolls up her sleeves. Her fingertips buzz. It hurts.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “As far as the Darkhold is concerned,” Rio continues, “all you have done is gain.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She does not know exactly what happens. There are still bodies littered in the leaves. “Take them away,” Agatha mutters. Her head pounds. A horrible itching, climbing up her spine. It’s horrible.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death continues, whispery, loud and ringing and violent in Agatha’s ears. “Taking this power and these bodies. The scales are tipped. They balance themselves, at any cost.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Stop.”
     </em>
     Agatha is unsure if the sound even leaves her throat, she steps backwards, there are bodies everywhere. She is itchy, so itchy, her blood burning.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It is the nature of the Darkhold to feed, but, like all things, it is a cycle.” Death is talking, eyes cast up towards the red moon, her veil pooling over her shoulders. “As you feed, and become stronger, the Darkhold will bury itself into you. In its history, it is a corrupting force.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Seven hooded witches, all those eyes watching her, cold and hateful, against her pleas. “Please.”
     <em>
      ‘Please.’
     </em>
     “I didn’t-”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stumbles over an arm. Rio reacts quickly, one hand wrapping steadily around Agatha’s waist, but she shrieks and shoves her away.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have
     <em>
      paid
     </em>
     ,” Agatha screams. She is crying — how long has she been crying? — but the tears burn her, burn her eyes and her skin. A hissing sound, the smell of flesh on fire.
     <em>
      “I have paid.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The skull face of Death is gone, and her soft human eyes now watch her. They are wide with something. Resentment rises like bile in Agatha’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “You,”
     </em>
     she hisses, lunging towards Rio, rolling them both through the dirt and kicking the reddened leaves up behind them. Agatha pins Rio into the forest floor, she is practically humming with magic. Above her, the clouds sift in front of the bloody moon. “You,
     <em>
      scale-keeper.
     </em>
     Answer me this, immortal goddess of departure, for it was because of the Darkhold that I sacrificed my coven, and it was for the Darkhold, that they tried to burn me at the stake.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A blank sort of shock. Narrowing, knowing eyes. A soft voice, gentle, but never gentle enough. “Was it?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha is boiling alive. She screams, releases Rio’s wrists, and pounds her fists into the dirt, shrieking, her hair wild and uncouth around her. Rio lays still, placated, patient.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Leave me!”
     </em>
     Agatha howls. “Leave me alone,
     <em>
      leave
     </em>
     me! I do not wish to see you. Go,
     <em>
      now
     </em>
     !”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She smacks an angry fist into the dirt, and blinks, and Death is gone, leaving nothing in her wake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1745, Yule
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Barefoot, in the snow, Agatha Harkness pulls her robe tightly around her and lets herself be whipped by the wind. Her hair lashes out around her form. The front door of her cottage is open, and she stands in the soft shaft of light from the candles lit inside.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She scans the woods, blinking through the nighttime, staring intently into the barren trees. She exhales heavily. She turns to go inside, and stops.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In the frame of her doorway, tiny and shivering. A rabbit.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes narrow. She readjusts her robe. “Oh good,” she mutters. “Dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She stomps through the snow, scoops the rabbit into one arm, and slams the door behind her.

<strong>
      1750
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When they come, as always, they come with fire.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘My dear. They are coming.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands, the chair scraping loudly against the floor, knocking backwards, one hand on her swollen stomach.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will kill them,” she says aloud, and there is no answer in response.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Hours later, Agatha roves, nearing mad, through her house. She can feel them now, their anger and hate. There are many of them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will kill them,” she murmurs, holding her stomach, always, relief in each kick. “I will kill them. I will kill them.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‘
     <em>
      It is what you do best.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A ringing response, and Agatha stands straight, a turning hunting knife in one hand. Her windows and door flicker with her wards, rowan and holly sweeping like vines over every entrance, small white candles flickering neatly under them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “How do they know?” she asks the nothingness before she can stop herself. She rubs her stomach. She wonders if he has made a weaker witch out of her. If word of her violent spree had caught in town. A convenless witch is a vulnerable witch, always. And five years ago, Agatha ran out her only other member.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Shouting, echoing through the woods. Agatha stills, her eyes closed, listening. They are almost arrived. As if it is already licking her face, Agatha feels the fire on their torches, and then they appear, small burning fireflies dotting a peaceful wood.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A hot rage simmers in Agatha. Knife pressed into her palm, she hisses and spits, howls and shouts as the fire grows nearer, as she peers through the darkness and is met with their long shapes now, their torches and weapons, their fear and hate.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A cloak over her shoulders, Agatha, breath heavy, unsteady, eyes unblinking and mouth twitching and contorted, steps out of her house. The figures stop, uncertain, at the sight of her now, rocking on her heels, one hand on her pregnant stomach and the other squeezing a knife.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Demon,” the first whispers begin, quiet, then loud, a demon and a temptress of the devil, a witch, carrying an abomination, and the torches and weapons are raised, and they continue forward.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will kill you,” Agatha whispers. The first forth, a man with a beard, is screaming, yelling, practically frothing at the mouth, and Agatha slowly raises her knife point to him. There is a brief moment. Her magic explodes, and without any ceremony, the man is knocked back, dead before he hits the ground.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A shocked silence from the crowd, then screams. And then
     <em>
      fire
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And then they are dead. Every single one of them. Agatha standing amongst the carnage of their bodies, freckled with blood, an arm here, a leg there, giant gaping wounds and the silence of the once-screaming, open-hanged mouth. Her cottage burns behind her. It’s heat murmurs against her back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha turns the knife over in her hand. She could wait, but she will not. She moves forward. And forward. And she does not look back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Amidst the wreckage, Death appears, tutting quietly at the violence of it. A splintering sound, and Death turns slowly to watch the house crumble, ablaze, rotting into ash. She stares at it for a long moment, and then turns around.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But it is too late. Agatha has disappeared into the forest.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1750, one month later
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      How much time?
     </em>
     ” Agatha pleads, head fallen back against a tree, her body shivering with pain, hot aches of it flashing through her. Death is gone. There is only Agatha, and then, there is Agatha and Nicholas.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     He is brightest thing she has ever known.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     He is an intelligent baby, quiet precisely when he needs to be, howling and screaming at the exact moments in which their abysmal state earns pity. He is 8 months old when he says, “Mama,” and Agatha can do nothing but cry, stupefied.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She laughs and laughs when he walks, his hands squeezed around her finger, his features forming, he is becoming, becoming right in front of her eyes. Soon they are talking together, singing together, he hums idly while she kills coven after coven, and they needn’t even a roof over their heads, skipping from town to town, slaughter after slaughter, at peace.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Nicholas is five, he eats blueberries out of Agatha’s cupped hands, seeds stuck in his teeth, staring absentmindedly into the trees, and says, “Mama. Who is she?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s head whips up and around, but there is nobody, and not the slightest disturbance.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Who, Nicky?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The lady from my dreams.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her mouth runs dry. Agatha swallows. “How do you mean, my child?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “She wears green,” he says, smacking a blueberry into his mouth, “she’s very pretty.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “How should I know whom you’re referring to,” Agatha says, trying to keep the edge out of her voice and succeeding only partially.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nicholas looks at her, blinking wide, innocent eyes. “I don’t know, mama. It just felt like you did. It felt like she misses you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did your pretty lady say as much?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No. She doesn’t speak.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pats Nicholas’s hair down, brushing it away from his forehead. “Is that so?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We pick wildflowers together. I wanted to bring a bouquet to you,” he frowns in concentration. “But then I woke up.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha kisses the top of Nicholas’s head, desperate to calm the rapid thrum of her heart. She thinks of Rio, and a horrible feeling murks in her stomach, tears pricking behind her eyes. “I’m sure… I’m sure it was beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nicholas nods. “She was. Do you know her?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha groans, standing up, pain hanging like a noose in her chest. “I do not.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Nicholas’s hand fits neatly into hers, and Agatha looks down at him, pushing away her tears. “Mama?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Come, my child,” she says, bending down to face him and kissing his tiny knuckles. “Let us pick wildflowers together. It’ll be the most magnificent bouquet the world has ever seen.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And then, as if in the blink of an eye, he’s grown, he’s hers, and then he’s gone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha doesn’t see her, but she knows that Rio is watching. Watching as she crumples to her knees, stacking stones upon his grave, kissing her locket, and who cares that she has nothing from Rio, because Agatha is draining witches by the handful, her power becoming enormous, her hands stained as if dipped in ink.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She moves ungracefully through town, breaches into another. The song has traveled with light feet. Her job becomes easy. Simple. So much so that Agatha begins to twist the events for her own amusement. Playing chess against herself. Agitated. Irritable. Remembering. Trying not to. Eaten by pain anywhere and everywhere.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And then, slowly, or with sudden rapidity, it is
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1835
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And Agatha kicks at a husk.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She sniffs and straightens, fixing her hair pinned under her hat. She spins purple magic through her fingers, scoffing and rolling her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She starts to leave, and then she hears the whoosh of air, the flutter of leaves.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘My love.’
     </em>
     An echoing whisper. Agatha frowns sharply, the spool of purple sparking at her fingertips. She evenly turns, tracking the treetops.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death steps out from behind a tree.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath catches. She dons a green men’s waistcoat atop a black dress shirt and trousers, white gloves, bare feet. And Agatha
     <em>
      feels
     </em>
     . Want, the relief of her touch, to ease into Rio’s body, into her warmth, to find her throat, to squeeze, to hurt, to see her bleed, and listen to her beg for a mercy that she did not give. It has been almost a century.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death bows. Gentleman-like. Cold.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha takes a deep, filling breath, raises her hands towards Rio, and lets her magic loose.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She sidesteps away from it deftly, and Agatha screams as she cuts her magic away. “Why are you here? Collect your bodies and leave. I have not wished to see you. I will never wish to see you.” Her hat has flown off in the effort, hair unraveling over one shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You once called me impatient,” Death says, with a hush to her voice. “Then perhaps you will now call me impatient and cruel. I needed to see you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs bitterly, tossing her hands in the air. “
     <em>
      Needed
     </em>
     to see me, hmm? Just like you
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to ruin my life.
     <em>
      Needed
     </em>
     to take him away.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nods in simple agreement. “Yes. I did.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha steps back like she has been slapped, and then her eyes narrow and she stalks towards Rio. “Do not talk to me. Do not find me. You will leave me be.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turns, and Rio watches silently as she goes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1868
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness punches through a window. The glass shatters around her fist, though with a soft whirl of purple magic her cuts fade. She makes a disgusted sound and jabs out the remaining shards hanging to the frame before climbing inside.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A dog barks from somewhere in the house, frenzied at the noise, and Agatha listens patiently for the scittering of paw steps. She smiles. “Aha,” the dog must be locked somewhere in the house. It’s barking, however, is incessant, and with a flick of her hand it stops entirely.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha takes a look around, squinting through the nighttime at the softly moonlit house, abandoned while its usual owners do a European tour.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In the meantime, Agatha hums happily and makes her way upstairs. She finds the closet of the houses’ mistress, and, gleefully clapping her hands together, proceeds to try on every dress she can find, matching it with an assortment of hats and gloves, preening in an extravagant mirror.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Finally, she sheds all of the clothes, leaving them in piles on the floor, and dons a soft robe. She fills herself a hot bath in a huge clawed bathtub, drinks aged wine that’s almost as old as her from the bottle, and sinks under the water.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha slips into the enormous bed, tucking herself under its many fine silks and heavy quilted cotton, she is lured eagerly by sleep, and the moment her breathing evens, a soft snore rumbling in her chest, a blackened figure crawls down from the ceiling to get a closer look.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Hooded, Death kneels at the bottom foot of the bed, hands wrapped around the silver bed frame. She flicks her hand and sends the curtains whipping open, appearing pleased with herself as moonlight washes into the room, framing Agatha’s pale, sleeping figure inside it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio kisses her palms and plants them on either side of the bed, murmuring a quiet incantation to assure Agatha a peaceful, dreamless rest from which she will not wake up until sunrise.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And, until then, Death places her chin in her palm, and watches.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There will be no sign of her when Agatha yawns awake, but she has always been suspicious of restful nights.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1892
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha has not slept a full night in ten years. Tonight she tosses, tangled in sheets, naked and groaning, mumbling. She fears her dreams. She sleeps in flashes and aches, unkind naps against a tree, in the alleyway of a rapidly expanding industrial city, and now, a dingy motel room above a bar. It is silent. Everything is too quiet, always. She has shed a life in the shadows of the woods for the cacophony of boom, towns, cities, machine and steel. But tonight, the city sleeps, and Agatha tries.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She is not alone, but here, she does not know this. Leant against the wall in the corner of the room, Death hovers, less watching, more listening, deciphering each groan and whimper, waiting.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     For the most part, it is unintelligible. And then, hushed, “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .” She strains to listen. “Please-” and then a moan erupts from her chest.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio paces across the motel room. She waits a moment, and then strips her jacket, unbuttons her blouse, and crawls over Agatha’s sleeping form, hovering above her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m here,” she whispers testingly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I miss…-” Agatha twists into her stomach. Rio stares down at her suddenly bared back, eyes tracing the indent of Agatha’s spine, the shift of her shoulder blades.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m here.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .” Agatha wakes up with a gasp, turns around, and grabs Rio’s face, pulling her into a deep kiss.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death groans, her hands immediately skimming Agatha’s naked body, filling her hands with her breasts, her sides.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re here,” Agatha moans, “you’re here.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes,” is Rio’s whispered reply, “I’ve found you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Are you real?” Agatha’s hands pulling at the ivory buttons, tears running down her face, quiet sobs blurring into moans as Rio bites and kisses down her neck.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I am here, now, and for you,” is all Death can mutter in reply before her mouth finds Agatha’s breasts, her teeth tugging gently at her nipples, tracing down to her ribs, her stomach. Agatha groans and arches, her hands making a mess out of Rio’s neatly pinned up hair, her face twisted into an agonized sort of pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please, I want you,” Agatha begs, and the sound of it is so nice, Rio groans against Agatha’s skin, sinking impatiently down between her legs. Her mouth finds Agatha’s clit first, and the swift motion of her tongue prompts a cry from Agatha. Her fingers next, dipping into soft folds, dripping wet, and Rio’s other hand hurriedly unbuttons her own trousers and settles between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Anything, my love,” Rio gasps against her, devouring, touching herself, every nerve alight.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lays back and lets herself take it. Her hands paw desperately at her pillow, she groans and trembles, gasps aloud, all rapid inhales and deep exhales, winding and unwinding, thankful, here, that all she can be and know is pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha comes, she rips the pillow out from under her head and shoves it down over her face, muting her desperate cries, removing it only to see Rio above her, her head resting on Agatha’s thigh, eyes heavy-lidded and blurry as she touches herself. Agatha pulls Rio up the length of her body, a wide-eyed reverence upon her face, and kisses her, deeply, unendingly, while she orgasms.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stays, fallen like an angel next to Agatha in bed, asleep, holding tightly onto Agatha as if she is sand, eroded at slowly by the wind until there is nothing left. Agatha stays awake, staring at Rio’s face, her fingertips brushing away at the soft locks of hair fallen in her face. She is staring until the sun rises, and staring still when Rio blinks awake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I want him back, Rio,” Agatha whispers softly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I cannot give him to you,” Rio says, her eyes closing once more, “but I can lead you to him.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What will it cost?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Your life.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha bites her lip, tears already welling, filling, and falling. She turns around, taking the blankets with her, and curls into herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio presses gently, but she is cut off.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You shouldn’t have come,” Agatha hisses. “You should have stayed away.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A hard look crosses Rio’s face. “It seemed like you enjoyed yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please.” Agatha’s voice is little more than a whisper. “Please. Leave.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is a long, aching silence.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You are a coward, Agatha Harkness.” A soft currant of wind rustles Agatha’s hair, and she knows that Rio is gone.

<strong>
      1899
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She comes again too soon.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alas, the opportunity nearly falls into her lap.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     One drunken night at a speakeasy, a giggling band of three girls wearing bracelets of each other's hair, talking in hushed whispers amongst themselves, casting sidelong glances at Agatha while she sings, alone at the bar, clutching a bottle of dark rum to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The girls seem out of place here. Truthfully, Agatha does too, the buttons of her blouse done wrong, her hat discarded, her skirts hitched up around her lap as she wobbles cross-legged on a stool. But the girls, fresh-faced and bright-eyed, grasping each other's hands, decorated in odd jewelry — quartz and tiger's eye and jasper — don’t belong here. Agatha has kept her eye on them all night as they nervously order a drink and share it between the three of them. The patrons don’t talk to them. They reek of trouble, three well-dressed gentlewomen in their early twenties huddled in a place people go to be unrecognized and unbothered, Agatha included.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Even through the stench of liquor Agatha can smell it. Burning wood, a haze of sage, glimmering between the three of them like fireworks.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She begins by humming. It’s unserious. A test, maybe, in the laziest sense of the word.  “Down, down…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The bartender huffs, Agatha has been here a bit too long, and the bottle she’s nursing hasn’t even come from his stock. Agatha grunts and waves him off.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Down the road… Down the Witches’ Road…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The girls cast nervous looks at Agatha. Her voice raises a little bit, the lyrics slurring and sloshing in her mouth, but doing the trick. She watches them through sidelong slits of her eyes, raising the bottle to her lips and downing the last of the rum.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands. Wobbling, she sets both palms on the bar table and smacks her forehead down onto it. There’s a touch on her shoulder. Agatha looks up, squinting at the girls.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They glance at each other before the tallest one speaks. “You… know about The Road.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pushes the rum bottle off of the bar. The girls jump at its shatter. She smiles.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The bushy-tailed coven speaks of going on New Year’s Eve, before one’s marriage and another’s being shipped off to Europe, and the last, so obviously in love with the other two, who cannot stand to part with them. Agatha could care less, and doggedly lets the girls follow her around, heads bowed, hands clasped excitedly, like a string of ducklings waddling behind their mother.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It’s snowing on New Years, and Agatha complains under her breath in half a foot of snow. The girls, normally chattering and tiresome, are unusually quiet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha does not necessarily need their power, not yet anyway, but she has never been one to deny herself a fresh meal, especially when presented on such a silver, delicate platter as this. It’s low hanging fruit, almost rotten in its ease, but Agatha is tired, and, frankly, careless.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But. Their power tastes good on the way down, young and potent, and, when their husks fall gently into the snow, they land without a sound. Agatha shivers in delight, studying her blackened hands, feeling the ripples and snags and itches of power spouting coarse through her body.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘This was a mistake.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands lower and curl into fists. She groans impatiently, turning to meet the fluttering shape of Death, barely visible in the darkness of the night except by the sheeting background of snow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “God. Give it a
     <em>
      rest
     </em>
     ,” she fires an angry stream of purple from her palms, sending Rio up into the bared branches of a tree, where she folds into nighttime.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grunts and spins towards the bodies, kicking snow over them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I was serious.” Death’s whisper against the back of her neck. “You shouldn’t have done this to them.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha curses, a hand raising above her head, brimming with energy, but freezing when Rio flicks the black curve of her blade against Agatha’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh great,” Agatha groans, rolling her eyes, “a knife you’re not allowed to kill me with. Don’t think I don’t know how your little rules work, my darling.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio chuckles dryly, “And magic you can’t hurt me with. What an impasse.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shakes her head, stepping away from Rio and from the knife. “Just escort them out of here and out of my sight, hmm?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio raises her eyebrows, tutting. “You’re not listening to me, my love. These witches you’ve just killed are a little more… high-profile than you thought.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows twitch. “And? Please. They were practically asking for it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death shrugs her shoulders, circling Agatha lazily, spinning the knife in her hand. “Perhaps you failed to notice that these girls were… well. In a word, connected. I wouldn’t be surprised if news of your… reputation starts to spread. And when it does, your dirty history will come spilling out at the seams.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Can it,” Agatha snaps, straightening her pale dress, “you speak as if I haven’t enemies already. What’s a few more, hmm? Now. Go.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “A few, five, ten witches, maybe… or…” Rio hums, “how about you try five generations of the most tightly knit coven empire in the Americas.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha flinches, mutters under her breath. “The Daughters of Liberty? Really?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And not one, not two, but three of their beloved heirs, dead at the hands of… oh! A two hundred year old witch killer.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha groans in her throat, her breath spilling from her mouth in white, smoky plumes. “Seriously. You’ve soured my lovely evening, attacked me, told me off. Have you quite finished?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I am warning you, Agatha. You’ve put yourself in danger. I wouldn’t be surprised if the entire continent knows of your… ravenous tendencies by daybreak.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighs, twitching and twisting her hair. She turns easily to Rio, suddenly close, her back leaning into Death. “What?” she snaps tiredly, “Are you offering your protection?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio inhales deeply into Agatha’s hair. “You have never needed my protection, sweetheart.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha holds herself tightly, shivering against the cold, leaning further into Rio, whose hands settle gently on her waist. “And I still don’t. Not with the Darkhold. I’ll be perfectly fine.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio has nothing to say to this. Instead, her grip on Agatha’s hips becomes firm, sliding down to her stomach. Agatha inhales sharply, her hands reaching above her shoulders to twist strands of Rio’s hair between her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Be careful, Agatha,” Death whispers against her skin, her fingernails digging into Agatha’s skin through the silks of her dress, eliciting a moan, and when Agatha turns in Rio’s hold, there is nothing and no one, just a few last specks of black sand settling into the snow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1907
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A horrific flash of a lightbulb. Agatha sits, smiling demurely at a clumsy, extravagant machine. The man taking the photograph slips out from under its curtain, and Agatha’s smile drops.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Honest to God. Are we done here?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The man smiles nervously. “Of course, ma’am.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha steps, grunting, out of the booth, gasping and stepping back as a man on a tall bicycle narrowly misses her. She straightens herself, cursing faintly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I hate this year,” she hisses, batting at her puffy gigot sleeves, fanning herself with gloved hands. The August air is hot, and Agatha ungracefully opens a parasol against the blaring sun.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha growls, stripping her garments, leaving them in her tracks as she stalks through the forest. Gloves dropped on the dirt, overbearing hat, her heavy over-dress, then her hands ripping agitatedly at the front lacing of her corset, which is thrown very pointedly behind her shoulder, slim skirts, stockings, and shoes, until she is approaching a lake, completely nude, and pulling the last few pins from her hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She steps gently into the lake, shivering at the shock of cold, grinning in delight as she submerges. She lets the cold water numb at her skin and cool her blood, her hair floating around her, eyes closed. With her ears under the water, all she can hear is the familiar thundering of nothingness. It lulls her, and her breaths even. Until she swears that under the water, she hears screaming.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows knit together. With eyes still closed, she cannot see two arms stretching out on either side of her from beneath the surface. They close in on her rapidly, like the claws of a hunter’s trap, and Agatha’s eyes open, a scream bursting from her but suddenly cut off as she is pulled under water.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha kicks, trails of bubbles exploding from either side of her mouth as she blindly scratches in the black water. Her back crashes, hard, into the bottom of the lake, her skin squelching into the mud and weeds, the tendrils of water vines closing in on her. Agatha squeezes her eyes and mouth shut tight, and then erupts with purple. She is launched out of the water, landing roughly on the shore, the sand scraping her skin as she skids through it into grass.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      What
     </em>
     in the-”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Close one,” the voice of Death comments bluntly. Agatha slowly raises herself, her palms digging into the ground, her hair hanging limply and tangled with seaweed around her face. Rio sits, squinting into the sun with one hand covering her eyes, in a black bathing gown. “You’d better be more careful than that.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lunges forward, kicking sand up in her wake, her and Rio both grunting as they roll across the shore. Agatha screams in frustration as she lands, yet again, on her back, Death grinning over her. Her wrists are pinned into the sandy grass, and Agatha jerks in struggle, a wave of purple magic rushing from her palms only to be immediately snuffed by Rio’s ephemeral green and black. Its weight down against her is choking, and Agatha is stretched, taut and tense and shaking, beneath Death’s sheer magic density.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha whimpers, and at the sound Rio lets loose ever so slightly, just enough for Agatha to send her spinning into the next tree.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio chuckles as she stands. “Very good, sweetheart. You’ve gotten so strong since we’ve known each other, haven’t you?” Agatha pulls herself onto her hands and knees, panting. Rio observes her naked form, eyes brows slightly raised, the ghost of a smile on her lips. “Going for a swim, were we?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha coughs and shakily sits up, coolly attempting to wring the water from her hair. “It,” she spits out lake water, “It was hot out.” Rio approaches, the hem of her bathing gown swinging faintly against her thighs. Her steps are soundless through the sand. “I wanted to- to cool down, and-” Agatha looks up, checks Rio’s distance, and without a moment's hesitation summons her magic and flings Rio into the lake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Only then does she stand, crack her neck, and dive in with her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s unseen shape slides invisible through the water, and Agatha, kicking below the surface, squints, looks. There is that eerie, peaceful silence, and then two arms hook themselves under Agatha’s and shoots them to air.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha gasps when they broach. Her magic flickers at her fingertips, but Rio wrenches her hands behind her back. “Better,” she hisses, pleased. Her other hand wraps around Agatha, finding her neck and forcing her face to the side.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Gotcha,” Rio whispers. Agatha’s jaw clenches, her eyes fall back, a half-moan slips from her throat and she yanks her arms in a failing attempt to struggle against the hold of Death.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’ve got me,” Agatha says, working a smile onto her face. “What next?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Depends,” Rio answers. Her hands slide across Agatha’s wet skin, her mouth closing over Agatha’s neck, and her teeth snapping closed over her pulse.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha screams and rips away from Rio, spinning to face her in the water only for Death’s lips to crash greedily down on her own. Agatha moans, her hands finding Rio’s body immediately, pulling her tightly against her, until she realizes that she’s being pumped with lake water as if drinking from the spout of a fountain. She jerks away, coughing and retching the water from her lungs, gasping.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death chuckles, spinning the skirt of her swimming gown in the water. “I was wondering just how eager you’d be, my lady.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Ecstatic,” Agatha pants through heaves, glaring at Rio. Death hums unenthusiastically, reaching for Agatha’s hand. “Don’t touch me,” she hisses, pulling it away. Rio bends her head, then softly takes Agatha’s hand once more.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Allow me to try again,” Rio murmurs. She pulls Agatha’s gently through the water, her bared back lining against Rio’s front, lightly trapping one hand and then the other between their bodies. Agatha’s chest rises and falls with exaggerated motion. Her heart spins wildly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you like this?” Rio whispers into Agatha’s ear, the side of her face pressed against her wet, dripping hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha writhes weakly. Her chin falls down to her chest. Death’s knee wedges itself between Agatha’s thighs and she spreads them before she can think to stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Good,” murmurs Rio, “very good.” She slides one hand down Agatha’s front, taking in every twitch and sharp gasp as her fingers play lightly against her skin. Agatha whimpers, and then Rio is inside of her, warm compared to the biting cold of the lake, her wrists tightly clasped behind her back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Being touched by Rio, an odd part of Agatha relaxes against her will or her instincts. She arches back into her, her head falling back against Rio’s shoulder, the sun throbbing into her eyelids. “I wasn’t going to come,” Rio admits softly. Her fingers twist, and Agatha flinches and groans, the rhythm of Rio’s hands and her weakly kicking feet creating soft disturbances at the top of the lake. “But I watched you all day,” she kisses Agatha’s neck, biting into the soft flesh between her shoulder and throat. “Really, I just couldn’t help myself.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re impossible,” Agatha pants out. Her muscles tighten, an involuntary and high-pitched whimper climbs from her throat. Rio grins, chuckles darkly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Keep going, my love. I know you’re close.” Agatha’s head tosses, her face the picture of blissed stress, and then all at once she tightens and convulsed, and Rio gasps, smiling an open mouthed smile, quickening the pace of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “No, no,” Agatha pleads at the overwhelming feeling as her orgasm fizzles away, only to be beaten back by Rio’s continuations. Death bites down her into Agatha’s shoulder, and the pain pushes her pleasure into a hazy, stumbling sort of place, she can feel another orgasm climbing from her navel, and it bursts against her, a searing pain-like pleasure, and Agatha’s mouth is open but little sound comes out, just choking bursts of breath.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh my,” says Rio, “Now how about that?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha becomes putty against Rio, who takes her in her arms and gently brings them both onto the lakeshore. Agatha is still convulsing with slight tremors as she is laid down in the sand, Rio settling next to her, pleased and smug and tracing her fingertips in whirls down Agatha’s body.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha buries herself into Rio’s side. Her hands find the hilt of Rio’s dagger stashed into the folds of her bathing suit, and she weakly attempts to stab it through Rio, though missing and slicing it into the sand. Agatha groans and lays against Rio, giving up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What a good effort,” praises Rio mockingly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hush,” Agatha says. “Don’t ruin it with the obnoxious sound of your voice.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Perhaps next time you will remember to open your eyes when you are trying to stab someone.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’ll keep that in mind. Now go, you sick animal, before I succeed in drowning you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Soon,” Rio whispers, and there is just as much threat in the word as there is promise, and she disappears, leaving only the strewn pile of Agatha’s clothes in her place.

<strong>
      1910
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stumbles out of the mouth of a cave, gasping at the feel of moonlight on her face. She grunts, holding her arm, blood staining her lace dress from the knitting needle stabbed through her arm. Agatha groans, murmuring incantations under her breath, purple wisps attempting to pull the needle out, to heal, but stopped by a thin veil of wavering energy around it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I hate enchantments,” Agatha mutters angrily, failing once more to heal herself around the needle. “I
     <em>
      hate enchantments!
     </em>
     ” She howls into the night sky, stamping her feet, the ground under her shaking with expulsions of purple magic. Growling senselessly, she spins around and backs out of the cave. With her one good hand, her magic takes hold of the roof of the cave and yanks, sending the mouth crumbling and closing it in a shower of gravel and boulder.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And
     <em>
      stay in there!
     </em>
     ” Agatha screams, spitting, winding around in dizzying circles, “Stupid bitches! Good luck with that five generation empire, now that all of you are
     <em>
      dead
     </em>
     . HAH.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Chuckling deliriously, Agatha staggers through the forest, the pain violent and throbbing, her vision blurry. She blinks, and when her eyes open, she’s face down on the forest floor, spitting moss.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Wh…” Agatha groans, rolling onto her side. Her whole body thrums with a stinging numbness. White spots float in her vision.
     <em>
      Poison
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha moans, panicked, murmuring rapid incantations, desperately trying to loosen the magic grip of the needle stabbed clean through her arm. It refuses to give. The poison flares in response. Agatha shrieks, and it echoes throughout the forest, unanswered.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The immobilization cuts into her feet, and Agatha gasps, twisting around, all feeling lost. She scans the forest wildly, looking for anything, but drawing blanks. She fires magic at her feet, the feeling moving up to her calves, and Agatha whimpers, watching the purple streams flicker.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      No no no no,
     </em>
     ” she whispers in hushed dismay. The feeling stretches to her knees. Agatha releases a scream of panic, clawing desperately at the hem of her ivory lace dress. An idea. Any idea. But she is alone, alone here. And then something.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “A personal belonging,” she whispers, eyes widening.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rolls onto her stomach, reaching out to grasp wildly at the brush. Her hands sink into a thorn bush and she hisses in pain, wrenching the branches out of the tangle.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha groans. The numbness climbs to her waist now, searing in its nothingness. She yells and surges with magic, watching the branch decay into brittle black ash.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s yours now, baby. Come on.
     <em>
      Quaerite me quaerentem te,
     </em>
     ” the pain arches to her stomach. Agatha shrieks, bleeding. “
     <em>
      Quaerite me quaerentem te. Quaerite me quaerentem te.
     </em>
     Please.
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     .” Her vision darkens. She feels herself fading out. “
     <em>
      Quaerite me quaerentem te, quaerite me quaerentem te, quaerite…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Bare feet step into her vision. And then black.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A pop like firewood. Agatha screams awake.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And is met with a mouth against hers. She blinks her eyes open but sees close to nothing, just flashes of green and black, but the scent of dead leaves lingers on her nose.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‘
     <em>
      It’s just me.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘Your vision will return gradually.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The pain flushes through her still, hot and terrifying. She can hear herself moaning and whimpering, but cannot awaken. She tips backwards into the black of unconsciousness.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She opens her eyes. Finally. And though her vision still swims and her body trills in pain, it is a duller buzz. Neutralized. Her breath scratches in and out of her throat. Dry. Her mouth feels so dry.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She fusses tiredly, and then water is tipped into her mouth. Her vision sharpens.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio, on the edge of a bed, a fireplace alighting a small cabin room. “A hunters lounge,” she says simply, shaking off a vest and rolling up her sleeves.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I…” Agatha’s face rubs gently against her pillow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hurt? Yes.” Her hands reach behind her head and begin to quickly braid her hair. An untied bowtie hands around her neck, under the collar of her dress shirt. She pops the first top buttons, and then crawls onto the bed with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will help you. But my way.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha feebly moans, and then Rio’s tongue is on her, kissing around her arm, she can feel the hole through her elbow stitching away. Her warm mouth kisses neatly down Agatha’s body, her dress has been done away with, with the calculated precious of a doctor, her magic pushing energy into her skin, her blood, feeling returning, pain ebbing. Agatha twitches and moans, moving with a sort of lethargy, like waking after a deep nap.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ‘
     <em>
      Look at me,
     </em>
     ’ beckons a soft command, and Agatha’s heavy eyes tip downwards at Rio, her unbuttoned shirt revealing a braless chest as she sinks lower on her palms, tongue dragging up from the top of Agatha’s thigh to her collarbones. “Better, hmm?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I,” Agatha slips into a whine as Rio’s mouth closes over one nipple. “I called for you…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have always answered when you have asked.” Rio explains, inhaling into Agatha’s sternum, the base of her tongue softly trickling up Agatha’s skin. “And I will always heal you when you are in need.” An impish smile, her tongue running along her teeth. “Though I prefer to be the one hurting you in the first place.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s voice cracks into a sigh. “Me too.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s tongue dips into Agatha, and her weak body arches softly. Rio sighs achingly, the vibration shivering through Agatha, every soft touch of Rio’s ministrations felt so intensely, so undeniable, overriding the still-fading pain under her skin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha cannot help but allow herself to submit, and the feeling is easy now, her body sore and tender, to give in is the kindest path, the softest, and Rio treats her here like she is soft grass braided into a basket, firm and gentle, careful not to snap her. And when she comes, Rio’s name is a hushed non-word on her lips, like a prayer, like thanking any god for a miracle she knew she didn’t deserve, her dance with her Death prolonged, at least for now.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1918
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha marches angrily through masses of shrieking crowds. To her left, a giant pinstriped carnival tent ablaze, bodies burning around its outskirts, a lion corpse sizzling into ash. To her right, swarms of people crying out, firemen winding hoses through them, horses rearing, trampling. And Agatha, scowling, in the middle of it all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A botched attempt to walk the Road with a half-assed coven of acrobats and palm readers and certified freak shows leaves Agatha wondering if her witching radar has gotten rusty or if the witching community has disintegrated.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She tears at her obnoxiously colorful frock coat, ripping through its dark embroidery, brass buttons littering the floor in her path. Her marching band top hat is chucked with a disgusted grunt into flecks of fire, the pluming white feather alighting. She considers toeing off her tall black boots, and the embroided trousers tucked into them, but considering the facedown piles of burning flesh dotting the circus grounds, perhaps it’s a better idea to keep them on, and she doesn’t totally mind the plated tips and spurs.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Chucking her quilted capelet into the ground, Agatha stomps it into the mud, snarling in frustration. The hair on the back of her neck raises. A buzzard call, low and sharp, cutting through the screams. Agatha looks up sharply, and, through the roars of red fire, sees the black-clad shape of Death stalking slowly across the grounds.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     This is not her fault. Not entirely, anyway. The acrobatic accident and the lion escape most definitely were, but the fire was only her responsibility removed by a few degrees. Either way, Agatha cringes and turns swiftly in the opposite direction, desperate to hide.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She checks quickly behind her shoulder as she speed walks across the grounds, shouldered on either side by panicked crowds. With a feral groan and an angry lash of her hand, Agatha splits the sea of people. They part, and Death stands, staring at her, at the end of their fleshy sea. Agatha yelps and veers to the left, locking herself in a circus booth and backing away slowly from the door. A flash to her right. Agatha gasps and spins, screaming as she is met with herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hall of mirrors…” she whispers, turning in a slow circle, her hands outstretched, fingers waggling. A skull behind her shoulder. Agatha screams, whirling around, and there is nothing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She laughs dryly. “I know you’re not here for
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     , hmm, lover?” she calls into the labyrinth of her own reflections. “Aren’t you a little too busy to be… hounding me down?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A low chuckle, from all angles, echoing with a sinister sting, a sharp ring in her ears. Agatha hisses, holding her palms over her ears, stumbling forward, or maybe backwards, finding only herself at every turn.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘I will always have time for you, sweetheart.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah yeah,” Agatha grumbles, her fingertips sparking with power. “I know you don’t have all night.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A splintering sound. Agatha tenses, and then yells and frantically covers herself as one of the mirrors explodes. Gasping, she peers over her arms, finding the hall of mirrors opened up into a storage closet. She stumbles inside, boots crunching over glass, and the door closes sharply behind her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Gotcha,” Rio says, smiling, framed in front of an open iron maiden.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Moi?” Agatha asks innocently. “You’re so… needy these days.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio looks down, laughing lightly, as Agatha steps closer to her. “You’ve been careless lately. It seems like you’ve scared off any respectable witch miles away with that whole Daughters of Liberty incident.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffs and waves her hand. “They’ll get over it. They’ll forget. It’s what they do.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Not me. And I wouldn’t be so sure about them either. Plus… you’re getting hungrier, aren’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please,” Agatha sneers, dismissive. “I have it under control.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do you?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiles, raises her hands out towards Agatha. “Take a guess, dearest.” Her fingers beckon, and a wave of magic sends Agatha sliding forward on the tips of her toes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, however, finds herself finally prepared. She steps into the magical pull, crowding fast into Rio, her eyes widening as Agatha’s purple-filled palm grips her throat and forces her backwards into the iron maiden. She slots neatly between the spikes, though her back hits the wall of the contraption with a crack.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs flatly, her fingertips squeezing into Rio’s throat. “Gotcha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grabs at Agatha’s wrists, a delighted smile scarring her face. “You got me, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grunts and releases her grip. Rio takes a deep inhale and chuckles, bending over her knees, straightening, and then is quickly cut off as Agatha kisses her deeply. Their teeth rattle against each other, tongues desperately finding each other's mouths. Rio moans loudly, clawing at the sweaty button-up under Agatha’s marching jacket.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is a sense of relief in the power of this, Agatha trapping Rio in the iron maiden, all teeth and tongue and nails, scratching for blood she’ll never be able to draw, indulgent in every rumbling moan and panting sigh she draws from Rio. Agatha has been easy to find in moments of weakness, in the simple truth of her mortality, and further easier to mold like a soft putty, ready to submit, wanting for warm touch.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My turn,” Rio giggles excitedly, beginning to step forward and her fingertips curling, but no power sifting through her hands. She frowns and looks down, only to see, beneath her feet, a soft purple glow. Rio looks up, an expectant gnarl on her face. “
     <em>
      Runes
     </em>
     ,” she hisses.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Runes,” Agatha confirms, her hands twitching.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Purple magic slides up Rio’s body, violet vines tying her sharply by the neck down to the back wall of the iron maiden, her feet spread shoulder-length apart, ankles similarly shackled, Rio gasping and shuddering, the magic splitting her dark dress at the seams and shredding it as if with claws.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “A trap?” she asks through gritted teeth.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugs, smiling. “Precautions, more like it. A circus and Road Walk on a new moon? The chances of it ending well were slim to none to start with.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s power, here, is finally unavoidable. Surrounded by cold, sharp iron, Rio unable to escape, her body loose in Agatha’s hands. It is a different kind of power than that of her seemingly usual trusting frailty, and a different power than that of the loser’s prize, the weaker’s lavishment.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingertips scrape indelicately down Rio’s skin the moment her dress slips off in tattered tendrils of fabric. Agatha inhales sharply, jaw clenched as her eyes roam up and down Death’s body. What does she know, now and in this moment, but want, honed and dangerous?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I still dream of you,” Agatha confesses into Rio’s mouth as her fingers feel for her, wet and soft and warm. Rio moans, a snarl twisting her mouth, eyebrows drawn. Agatha is rough against her clit and Rio yells out, fighting against her magic restraints but coming up short. “Oh please,” Agatha jeers, sliding a finger through Rio’s folds and eliciting a soft cry, “I know you could get out of these if you really wanted, runes or no runes. But you’re right,” a harsh thrust, Rio’s body teeming and jolting, “why would you want to?” Rio writhes fitfully, panting, as Agatha fucks her, drawing long moans from her chest, a fidgety restlessness about her, trapped in Agatha’s magic hold.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Rio’s orgasm grips her, it is violent, and Agatha watches cautiously as black swaths of her power shroud the iron maiden. Rio whimpers pitifully and Agatha kisses her, feeling her teeth bite severely into her bottom lip as she shakes with the power of it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio cries out sharply and her body goes limp, hanging mutely against Agatha’s binds, her hair loose and thick in front of her face and chest heaving with sordid pants. Agatha barks out a hushed laugh, releasing the binds and letting Rio fall into her arms. “Gotcha,” she whispers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Their eyes do not leave each other for one moment. Not while Agatha backs away, not while Rio’s black and green magic swirls around her palms and feet, stepping naked towards Agatha. Even when Rio disappears, nodding slightly to Agatha, Agatha can still feel eyes. She shudders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      1923
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jazz music, prohibited champagne by the fountain-full, glamor, chandelier light, and Agatha Harkness in a form fitting, tasseling blue dress, pulling her elbow-length gloves off with her teeth, leveling a hard stare at Rio, who watches smugly from her seat on the edge of a velvet couch. In a shorter dress adorned with wrapping patterns of peacock, Rio lays loose and relaxed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The party rages on downstairs, but up here, in the book-lined study with open bay windows, there is only them. The gloves drop to the floor. Shoes stepped out of next. One hand reaching behind her body to pull the zip down. The dress falling limp onto the floor.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Smoking from a long pipe, Rio watches evenly. Smoke curls out of her nostrils, obscuring her face ever so slightly. She reaches out one hand and beckons Agatha forward. Without rush, Agatha walks towards Rio, straddling her waist comfortably, completely bared on Death’s lap.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “This decade looks good on you,” Rio hums. She takes the pipe from her mouth and taps it gently against the side stand ashtray. She exhales, and smoke billows into the space between them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “All decades look good on me,” Agatha snorts.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiles. “Of course. But this one makes you especially…” her warm eyes travel slowly up and down Agatha’s nude form, and Agatha’s stomach tightens, champagne buzzing in her head. “Bright.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs, playing softly with Rio’s hair. “And has you working overkill, hmm?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I get my playtime.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hums in response, gently cupping Rio’s face while her hands settle atop her hips. “Don’t you want to see how wet I am for you, my Lady Death?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A dark look dances across Rio’s eyes. One hand traces teasingly down between Agatha’s legs. Now, exposed she is, here, sitting atop Rio as if she is on a throne. One finger teases slowly at Agatha’s folds. She exhales sharply. Her fingertips clench Rio’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Very wet, indeed, mistress,” Rio whispers. Without breaking eye contact, she sucks her finger, and Agatha groans.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Before long, Agatha is squirming on Rio, riding two fingers, her neck exposed as her head drops back. Rio whispers encouragement. “Keep going, Agatha,” she purrs, her thumb rubbing tight circles against Agatha’s clit. “You’re doing amazing, baby.” Agatha moans, pushing her hips deeper into Rio’s fingers and earning herself a pleased groan. “Good, that’s good.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha can feel the golden edges of orgasm closing in on her. Rio pumps into her harder, deeper, her pace steady and consistent. She groans, clawing at Rio’s back, flinching at the nip of teeth at her pulse, the dams of orgasm only breaking when Rio bites again, so hard this time that Agatha is sure she’s drawn blood, and she cries and mewls, hips jutting against Rio who murmurs unintelligibly, perhaps some ancient language, a tongue known only to her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio lays Agatha down on the velvet sofa, pleased, watching her body jerk. Agatha stretches, moaning, her head resting in Rio’s lap and Rio playing with her hair. They sit in a pleased silence, Agatha sighing contentedly at Rio’s fingers pushing her hair off of her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Something unreadable flickers across Rio’s face. “Agatha,” she all but whispers. “Can I ask you something?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hums in response but opens her eyes. Rio stares out into a full moon. The curtains flutter with a cool wind.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I wondered if perhaps… I might stay with you tomorrow. For the anniversary of… of Nicky.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The words are all it takes for Agatha to spring to her feet. She stands, tall and straight, staring down at Rio. “You take his name out of your mouth,” she says coolly, gravely.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A stark look of grief. Fleeting, gone. “Agatha. I ask so that you will not be alone, I-”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I would rather be alone than be with you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The sudden coldness of it is a plunge into icy water. Rio stands. Agatha faces away from her, searching the study for a robe and throwing it on when she finds one hung haphazardly on the back of a chair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You cannot be serious,” Rio says desperately.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha turns to face her, there are tears welled in her eyes. “You have overstayed your welcome.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “This place is not yours.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha snarls at Rio. Outside, there is a scream, a gunshot, and a loud crash. Panic erupts. Rio’s eyes flick instinctually towards the sound, her whole body perked and attentive for a moment, like an alert hound. Agatha scoffs.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Go ahead,” she says, wiping her tears with the palms of her hands. “Be gone, reaper. Their night is already ruined, why not throw an inescapable monster into their mix?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio starts abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Me?
     </em>
     A monster? You of all people should know that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I do my duty. But
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     … you, Agatha Harkness, renowned serial killer, soothsaying succubus, evil incarnate. You should be heartless by now. Why.
     <em>
      Why
     </em>
     do you cry? What right do you have to hurt?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha says nothing. Rio screams and sends an ornate lamp shattering against the wall. She unsheathes her knife.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Say something!
     </em>
     I have never regretted what I did for you, no matter what you have to say about me. But perhaps the easier thing would have been to never have done it at all. So why?
     <em>
      Answer me!
     </em>
     ” She holds the point of her knife at the base of Agatha’s throat, shaking, fiddling with her grip on its hilt.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha speaks, her voice falls from her mouth in a hushed, pained whisper. “I… I couldn’t live thinking he’d rejected me before he could even know me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “He loved you, Agatha,” Rio cries, dismay across her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha barks out a scraping laugh through her muted sobs. “He knew six years of me. You- You’ve known centuries of me, and look where we are.” Rio steps back like she has been slapped. The knife lowers. Agatha exhales a half-hearted scoff that is more like a sob, and sinks to her knees on the carpet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A beat. Rio shakes her head slowly. “I knew you for one day, one hour, one minute and I was yours.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Red fury flushes Agatha’s face. “I do not belong to you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have never asked that of you. I have never asked anything of you, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A moaning sob strangled from her throat. Her palms face the sky, fingers tensed into claws. Tears drip off of her chin, her nose. “I hate you,” she screams at Rio. Her voice does not crack, it shatters into a million pieces.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio drops onto her knees in front of Agatha, grabbing her shoulders. “Why?
     <em>
      Why?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Please just go,” Agatha holds herself tightly, her fingertips burying into her forearms. “Please. Why must I see this face?” she cups Rio’s cheeks, her thumb brushing against her skin. “It hurts me. It hurts me, my Lady Death.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shakes her head slowly, struggling for words. “You- You fell in love with this face.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Leave me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Stop running.” Rio stands, threatening the limp form of Agatha with brimming green energy at her palms, with curling tendrils of black circling them hungrily. All the magic in the world could not bring Agatha Harkness to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do not let me see you again.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio screams in frustration, dropping her magic. “I cannot.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Why? Why do you torture me?” Her voice is a weak whisper.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     What she does not expect is silence, is Rio leveling her with an unreadable expression. Agatha looks up. The softness of her sadness has always taken Rio by surprise.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She shakes her head. “You know why,” Rio murmurs. “You have always known why and you hate me for it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Agatha says, trying to sharpen her voice into a sting but it only coming out deflated and gravely. “I do. I said I would hate you forever and I do and I always will.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sighs. She does not meet Agatha’s eyes. “I will always find you, Agatha. I can’t help myself.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha screams, her fingernails plunging like claws into the carpet beneath her. “Selfish,” she hisses, sobbing. “You are
     <em>
      selfish
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Here, with you… Yes. I am. You are the only thing I have ever desired and it
     <em>
      consumes
     </em>
     me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I hate you,” Agatha says insensibly, “I will never forgive you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio steps back, away from Agatha’s shaking, piled form. “It is not me you are running from, Agatha. I will find you, as I always do, and we will have this same conversation, like we always do, and our cycle will repeat itself. You will feel this way forever. Whether I am here. Or not.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sniffs. She looks, tattered, up at Rio. “Maybe,” she says. “And maybe we were doomed from the start.” Rio’s face hardens into a grimace. “If you cannot help but seek me out, then I… I will make it easy for you. Goodbye, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Confusion flashes across Rio’s face. Agatha murmurs under her breath, the pages of the Darkhold in her mind, her eyes rolling back into her head, and, as gently as being tucked into bed, the Darkhold wraps itself around Agatha in a suffocating embrace and then she is gone. Rio stands, a look of impassable shock mounted onto her face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” she asks out loud. For the first time since she has known her, Rio reaches out, feeling for Agatha Harkness, and comes up empty.

<p>
     And then, Agatha Harkness is dead.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She is rapid decay, an unerring display of vivid mold, sinking into the ground, brilliant rot. Rich, black soil, luminous, unfurling mushrooms, vines and thorns and the pinpricks of flowers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death’s footsteps leave no prints in the ground.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And Agatha Harkness hears song birds.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She blinks awake, squinting into a pale sun. Her hands cover her eyes, and when she sits up, she feels grass beneath her. A white lily lies on her lap.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You were having a nightmare. You’re okay now.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha turns. Rio sits beside her, her knees up to her chest, wearing a dark green summer gown.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I was…” she thinks. Here is her home. Behind her, her cottage. And in front, the woods she has stared into hundreds, thousands of times before. “I was dead.” Black magic siphoned into her veins, tears on her cheeks, an obliterating surge of power. “I died,” she says, and raises a hand to her face, and feels that she is crying.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You did,” is Rio’s simple agreement. Agatha turns to face her. Her face is unadorned and placid. Her hair swishes past her face in a gentle breeze, loose around her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha swallows. She looks around, but nothing seems out of place. It is just her home, from so long ago. “Why… where am I?” She remembers sparking blue magic, its power being pummeled into her, like cold water after having been dying of thirst. She remembers his face. She thinks of soft green eyes, a kind voice, tiny hands, Rio’s mouth on a face just like hers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I can’t… go,” Agatha says. “I still… that boy needs me. I must go back.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It won’t be the same.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I know. I know that.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands, offering her hand out to Agatha. “Follow me. Before you go. I have something to show you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha takes her hand, raises herself onto her feet. Their fingers entwined, Rio leads Agatha to the cottage. She looks around, eyes tracing every familiar detail. A rabbit shuffling in the corner, wind chimes, dried yarrow and thyme and mugwort atop every surface, being bundled with twine, the job half-finished.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It burnt down,” Agatha says, as if speaking to herself. She feels a soft linen curtain. It had been a gift from Rio, she remembers. Agatha turns towards Death, who stands in the doorway and watches. “I don’t understand.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Something not unlike fear momentarily plays at Rio’s eyebrows. “You once told me that I thread myself between the stitches of time. That I wait for nobody and nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha nods. “It’s all true.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You have always known what I am,” Rio says softly, avoiding Agatha’s eyes. “We are in a pocket of sorts. We are away from the threads, as you called them, unbound by reality, hovering not between the living and the dead, but far from it. Somewhere else entirely.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha straightens. Her breath catches. Confusion clenches her jaw. “I have unfinished business.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “And you will be able to return,” Rio assures. She meets Agatha’s gaze. There is a plea in it. A timidity. “For now, this… this is my gift to you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha inhales slowly. She turns, studying the cottage, so achingly familiar. “A pit stop, huh?” Rio says nothing. “And what’s the catch?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio has made hardly a move towards Agatha. She swipes at her skirts. “The catch… is that you stay here with me. For as long as you desire. You may return back to the mortal world as an apparition, or continue your journey with me into the afterlife whenever you please. But here, the confines of time are meaningless. We are unaffected by any existing reality. Together.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha watches Rio with an unreadable expression. A steady gaze, a feeling in her eyes like putty, the texture of syrup, a downturn to her partly opened lips, eyebrows raised slightly, a soft crease between them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio exhales. Her face reads pain. She looks away from Agatha. “What you did for that boy… after all these centuries. And I have brought you here, to this realm of neutrality, to be mine, outside of time like an echo. A final act of selfishness, like you have always known me to be.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A sigh that is half a sob. “You brought me here…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I did. I did this.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands reach to cup Rio’s face. She flinches at the touch, almost instinctively, and then she eases, sighs, watches Agatha’s mouth. There are so many things Agatha can say, and she thinks all of them. Some of them even tickle softly at her lips, teeth forming the words, and she would mean them, every one, and she looks in Rio’s eyes, the color of hand-tossed earth, and knows she doesn’t need to say any of them, they’re all there, between them, the solid weight of a mutual understanding, in spite and because of it all, the seed of their lives together, sewn in a silence, and in each other’s gazes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They have always loved each other, they have always been sorry, they have always hated, they have always forgiven, falling and tumbling down the depths of each other's eternal grief.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha kisses Rio, it is so, so gentle, like feathers. Her hands cup Rio’s face but even then, her fingertips are light, skimming, palms nothing more than a ghost of heat on Rio’s neck. They pull apart, slowly, very slowly, foreheads pressed against each other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I missed you,”
     </em>
     Rio breathes, and in response, Agatha whimpers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s fingers tug weakly at the cloth of Agatha’s dress. Their kiss deepens. Now, Agatha’s fingertips dig painfully, pitifully, into Rio’s scalp, as she pushes Rio against the wall, driving herself into her, a consuming pull in her palms, a whine and a rumble in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio seems to dissolve under her touch. Her constitution peels away like layers, constraint cracking, the gentle tug of her hands turning obsessive, fingertips into claws, shredding tears of fabric. She teems under Agatha, a cornered animal, her open-mouthed kisses flashing with teeth. And Agatha, in her desperation and sadness, a calm that seems ancient, a harried control, minded by glacial sorrow, consuming every touch Rio gives her. Rio is hers, is hers, just as she always has been.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha fists at the cotton cloths of Rio’s dress, pulling it down the length of her body, leaving her bare and bronzed in the orange glow of sunlight. She pays no mind to her nakedness, her mouth on Agatha’s neck, fingernails through her skin, tugging at her hair, biting and violent and loving.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “To the bed, my love,” whispers Agatha, and Rio claws her into a tight embrace. Agatha inhales deeply as she is suddenly on her back, sinking into the plush layers of a bed she hasn’t felt the embrace of in centuries and centuries. Agatha sighs into a groan as Rio, on top of her, yanks frantically at her dress, and the wet warmth of Rio’s tongue and teeth sifts into her skin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I have missed you too,” Agatha murmurs, her voice cracking as Rio’s hand pushes Agatha’s knee up to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My love,” Rio moans, nibbling at Agatha’s throat, tongue lapping under her jaw, canine tooth at her earlobe. “I have waited. I have waited for you.” Her fingers play at Agatha’s cunt, fingers stroking through her slit. Rio chuckles lowly at the clear sheaths of wet coating her fingertips. Her hips jut between Agatha’s legs. Agatha groans, her head tossed back into the pillow. “I have longed for you.” Agatha curses, one hand grasping at Rio’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You taste just like I remember,” Rio says through smiling teeth. She bites down on the tender vein in the innermost corner of Agatha’s thigh. Agatha groans and tosses backwards, bucking into Rio’s fanged touch.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s only been-” Agatha pants, groans, Rio’s fingers curling inside of her, tongue flat against her clit, “God.” She claws desperately at Rio’s hair, her other hand gripping desperately at her pillow. “-a century,” she punctuates with a whine.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio lifts her head. Her chin and jaw glimmer, wet. Her tongue swipes across her teeth. She watches carefully as she fucks Agatha, an eager, wild-eyed look across her face. “And I have thought of you every hour, have looked for you, have called my powers to yours and felt nothing but the bite of dark magic.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha whimpers, her body shuddering and jolting with the rhythmic thrusts of Rio’s hand. “You’re angry,” she hisses. It is partially accusatory, or perhaps factual, a bit teasing. Rio smirks.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m desperate,” she replies. And before Agatha can spill into her orgasm, Rio leans up over her body and kisses her. Agatha tastes herself, and tastes the scalding flavor of want that seems to burn in Rio, burn and burn.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She feels the agony of it all, the winding tides of pain that they are. Together, they sculpt a montage of misery, a massacre of love, but it is love, it has always been love. She knows that now. If she takes a deep breath, the stricken currents of grief that batter against her seem to ease, to flow through instead of against. Does Rio feel it too? A lightness. Ridged and ugly and scar-like. But scarred over.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s desperation rears, the unseemly, stinging head of it bites to bleed. Agatha cries out, swept into orgasm.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     /
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Their pocket shines with nighttime.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They listen to crickets, Agatha in Rio’s arms, her back pressed warmly against her. Shadows hum softly. Stars above them. A curious curve of moon.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s familiar,” Agatha says. Rio’s thumbs rub her palms.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you miss it?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighs and flutters her eyes closed. “Maybe. When I had nightmares, maybe I would think of it. But it reminded me of you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio presses her nose into Agatha’s hair, inhaling slowly, rubbing lightly against her. “I missed it,” she whispers. “I missed it everyday, since the moment it burnt down.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Maybe I missed all my nice furs from you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sits up, facing towards Agatha. Agatha tilts her face towards Rio, and they kiss, slowly, deeply.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     /
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Their days are not made up of time, though there is a gentle ebb and flow of sun and moon. Their days are made up of moments, of instances, of cooking and holding each other, of sex and cacophony, of cautious conversation.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Do you remember when you first met me?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pauses. She looks up, her hands covered in bread dough, flour brushing against her cheek. “The day I met you is not the same as the day you met me. Of course I remember.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, leant lazily back in a chair, her feet kicked up, sighs easily and rolls her head backwards. “I barely remember it. I barely remember anything. But I feel it all. I feel every memory that my mind fogs over.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pulls dough off of her fingers. “What do you not remember?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “So much of this place. Our fights. How often you were here. Nicky, even feels like a smudge, sometimes.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “As opposed to me feeling like a stain?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiles. “Maybe.” Rio walks to her, sitting on her knees by Agatha’s chair. Agatha runs her fingers through her hair, strokes the flour off of her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio rests her head on Agatha’s thigh. She licks the dough off of her fingers. “I remember everything. I have no choice.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Does that make it harder?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio turns and looks up towards Agatha. “But I wouldn’t give it up.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hums in response. They sit, Agatha playing with Rio’s hair, Rio sucking the bread dough from her fingers. “I remember how many of my dresses you destroyed.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A delighted, dark look flutters over Rio’s face. “I remember destroying your bed.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs loudly, “Yes. I remember that too.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands and settles onto Agatha’s lap, her hands clasped behind her back. She bends slowly, kissing tenderly down Agatha’s neck, licking under her jaw. Agatha sighs and knits her fingers through Rio’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We were quite… keen back then, hmm?” Agatha whispers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Pulls back slightly. “Back then?” she asks before kissing Agatha. She moans, her fingernails scratching down Rio’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “We were ambitious back then,” Agatha jeers, hushed.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio giggles and stands up tauntingly out of Agatha’s reach. She rinses her hands and pushes the bread into the fire stove. “As opposed to what? I would consider this whole thing ambitious. My Agatha Harkness, the only known survivor of Death’s preferential treatment.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shakes her head, sitting up and unbuttoning her blouse. “The most powerful being I will ever know.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shrugs. “That you ever knew. Let’s not forget you’re dead.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Mm. Yes, what a shame.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiles. “A shame.”

<p>
      so hard trying to write agatha reckoning with herself, which reckoning with rio ultimately is. she’s so unforgiving and angry. it’s hard to imagine she would even say yes to rio’s gift but we have to imagine something in her broke or healed when she let herself finally die.
     </p>
<p>
      so hard trying to write rio too but that’s. just bc she’s silly

<div>
<p>
     Agatha moves through this off-life with a certain trepidation. It’s back. She knows it never left, of course, but it’s loud here, like the rush of blood in her ears. Fear.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Four hundred years has worn down on the ancient genetic terror of a mortal witch in love with Death herself, and, in their mutual chaos and confusion and anger, the fear simmers under her skin like an old friend. She doesn’t roam like Rio does. Rio has always left and come, she is an ebb and a flow, as natural as the tide. But Agatha stays within the confines of their cottage and the outskirts of the wooded property.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She enjoys her moments of solitude, in some ways. She thinks of them as unspoken gifts from Rio, who kisses and touches with such a need that the little spaces feel very intentional and sacrificial. She enjoys them, but it’s lonely, of course, and for once she feels
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There are funny things that happen when one grieves and grieves and spends a whole life grieving and lifetimes and lifetimes commiserating in it. It is that Agatha moves. She has moved non-stop for centuries, chasing nothing, running from many things but most importantly - also nothing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And now; perfect, absolute stillness.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha thinks about this utopia. She fears that one day, one day soon, it will start to feel like her own personal hell. Rio knows this too, she’s sure, which is why she frets about like a needy cat, winding around Agatha’s ankles, purring and perfect and well-behaved, disappearing at odd hours, leaving presents at her feet like dead mice on a doormat. It’s both a sadness and a comfort, as is everything that Rio is to her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Not many misunderstandings lay between them. For that, Agatha is grateful. They seem to be encased in amber with their fingers intertwined. Anger that becomes so pointless in the face of the only other existing person who knows
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     better than the anger-bearer herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     None of it seems real. Of course, in many ways, it isn’t. Agatha leans back in bed and her back is met with Rio’s chest, her open arms folding over Agatha, her mouth at the nape of her neck. Agatha shakes in the tides of a nightmare and doesn’t even need to wake up, gentle words are already being whispered against her ear. She goes hungry without realizing it, but there is always food when she’s ready. The rabbit follows her closely, hops where she wanders.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When it overtakes Agatha, those pitted voids of sadness, when she wakes and cannot stand, when she catches herself staring out the window and knows in her heart that it has been hours, when she walks outside barefoot, crying, but cannot get herself to breach the forest, there is Rio, with a bowl of steaming arroz con dulce, dotted with raisins and sprinkled with cinnamon.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It is not a softness she has known in a very long time. It reminds her of Nicky. But Rio has always reminded her of Nicky, and perhaps she’d never have admitted it, but Nicky always reminded her of Rio. The soft tan of his skin, the shell of his ear, the shape of his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio has never brought up Nicky, and so they have never talked about it. But it is there, always. Agatha and her fear that clings to her heels like a shadow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blinks, inhaling sharply, and sees that it is night. She was watching the sunset, she thought. Too few candles flicker haphazardly, shadows dance like demons across the walls. Agatha jerks into motion. She was waiting for Rio, she remembers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She lights each candle, the cottage glows. And then, outside, Agatha can feel her, in that way she has always been able to feel her, dried leaves, blood, buzzards, and Agatha goes to stand but the door swings open on its own and half the candles flicker in aggravation. Rio stamps into the cottage, in trousers and a loose white shirt, stained, splattered, with blood.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She offers no explanation, nor does Agatha ask for one, just leaves the game outside. The moon is full; bright. There is a gleam in Rio’s eyes. Agatha watches with an expectant sort of surprise cocked on her face, a welcome greeting, a “go on”.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stands before Agatha, as if in audience, and slowly begins to strip her clothes. She pulls the shirt over her head; its billowy forearm sleeves are tattered, the cross-ties laced at the collar soaked in red, and there are no layers underneath, so her bared skin is misted with red in patches like clouds.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She peels her brown trousers off next, her socks, her briefs, and then she steps close to Agatha. A yank of magic from her outwardly pointing finger pushes Agatha down into the chair. Rio takes a seat comfortably on her lap. Agatha chuckles, her palms grazing across Rio’s bloodstained sides.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you get there too early or what?” Agatha asks teasingly, though there is a breathless timidity to her voice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio scoffs and shakes her head slowly. “Come, mistress,” she says softly, “you know what I want.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grins. The tip of her tongue plays against her canine tooth. She sizes Rio up, then leans down, her tongue pressing flat against Rio’s sternum, licking up. Rio sighs into the motion, her head falling back. Agatha finds the blood smeared across her collarbone and is diligent, her tongue brushing warm, wet skin while Rio’s hands thread into Agatha’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She’s covered in it. Blood. It tastes like fox. It’s not long before Agatha moves her to their bed, and then it’s her leaning over its edge, Rio’s back in the soft bedding and her legs wrapped around Agatha’s waist.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s wrists trapped tightly in Agatha’s hands, she sucks the blood off of her skin. Behind her ear, her neck, under her chin, her collarbone. Agatha shifts down Rio’s body, and Rio whimpers softly. Her noises. Agatha moans in a hushed, busy tone. She has missed Rio’s noises, her inhuman whines and growls, every jerk of her body more animal than human, but Agatha’s name on her lips so very real.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth is hot, and she bites and sucks at Rio’s nipples, then at her ribs, her hands releasing Rio’s wrists to dig sharply into her sides. “Agatha,” Rio whispers. She says her name so much lately. Agatha wonders if Rio has noticed. If it’s on purpose, or just the flow of their lives, just Rio settling into Agatha, just as she has been searching for for centuries.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha nestles between Rio’s thighs, her tongue sinking into her. The sound Rio makes as her back arches and chest caves into an inhale is almost a mewl. Agatha cannot help but smile into her. She tastes like safety and October and thunderstorms.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio claws at Agatha’s hair, groaning as her pleasure begins to slowly wind and unwind. Agatha’s fingers join her tongue, rubbing circles on Rio’s clit while her tongue laps steadily. “Agatha,” Rio whispers, “Agatha. Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She buzzes into orgasm, taut and keening, her fingernails digging sharply into Agatha’s scalp as Agatha chuckles deeply. She crawls up on the bed, kissing Rio, who sighs in the delight of tasting herself on Agatha’s mouth.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “My love,” Agatha whispers, kissing Rio’s jaw and ear, “well done. Should we really clean this blood off of you now?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio laughs lightly, stretching comfortably on their bed. She opens her eyes, meets Agatha’s gaze, and then blinks in surprise.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha gives her a look. “Oh?”
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     Rio shovels one hand through the thick tresses of Agatha’s hair, wrapping a small lock around her fingers and then sweeping it down in front of Agatha’s face. It is white. Agatha blinks.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh.” Rio plays with the lock of hair between her thumb and forefinger. “What does it mean?” asks Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Maybe nothing,” Rio says, though there is a small crease between her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Is it…” Agatha searches for the words to say. The soft fear under her skin flares, hot. “Is it dangerous? Is my soul in danger here?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shakes her head. “No. It is not a danger upon you. This realm is not exactly made for the mortal soul, but it is also not hostile. I have known some of its effects, but I suppose not all.” Agatha’s face is calm, but Rio sees the concern, the slight heft to her breathing. “You are in no danger, my love.” Rio kisses her, softly, her face in her hands. “Trust that I will protect you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha swallows, sighs, but nods. She has no other choice, and so she will. She settles down in the bed next to Rio, who brushes the hair off of Agatha’s face, tucking it behind her eyes, watching her with the softest gaze.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Come hunt with me,” Rio says. “Do you remember the stag I was teaching you to hunt? When you shot an arrow at it and it flew right between its antlers?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled a laugh, shaking her head. “I got better.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You did. Come hunt with me. Out of the cottage. You’ll like it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pulls herself closer to Rio. Her head rests against Rio’s temple, her hands fiddling with her fingers. “Okay,” she whispers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Death kisses her, smiling. “Agatha,” she murmurs. It beckons no response, the ways prayers never do.

      ‘Trust that I will protect you.’

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha wakes up, standing on the outskirts of the woods. She’s been sleep walking again. She looks around for Rio — such an odd first impulse these days — but sees no one. The moon is a sliver held precariously in the sky like a hangnail.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She grunts, rubs her eyes. She’s wearing nothing, per usual. And where is her protector now?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs to herself, shaking her head. She feels no fear, no sense of dread, no hairs raised on the back of her neck. She simply stands outside, her cottage some meters away, without clothes, without anybody. She’s never been safer.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio has always been Agatha’s. She has always known this. They both have. But Agatha… she turns to watch the cottage. A candle flickers in the kitchen window. She has never belonged to anybody but Nicky. A blissful six years, she was somebodies, and now, and now, she is Rio’s, she knows it, trapped as if in a snowglobe, no matter how much Rio may try to make it seem like it is not.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lays down. The grass is cool on her skin. She drinks starlight and nighttime and the pathetic milky shine from the cut of moon, like a scar in the sky.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watches her, of course. Her legs dangle off of a tree branch where she sits, nestled, watching Agatha with an unreadable expression. One does not wake a sleepwalker, just watches and follows and listens with unbidden patience. She is hidden in darkness, wears it like a blanket.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sits up, leaning back on her palms, her eyes closed and face tilted up. She exhales slowly. Her fingertips curl into the grass, dig into the dirt. She calls out, “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And when her eyes open, Rio has shed the darkness and stands over her. “Hello, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha raises her arms up, silent in her question, in her request, but Rio understands, as she always does. She rids herself of her clothes and then lowers herself over Agatha. Agatha leans back with a satisfied sigh, her arms wrapping around Rio’s neck. They kiss. It is like falling, and knowing you’ll never touch ground again.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s mouth is everywhere on her, her touch like skipping rocks across the lake of Agatha’s skin, fleeting and monumental. When Rio fucks her, Agatha twists and groans with the ease of the greedy and unashamed. It is like practicing. Belonging to Rio. A practice she has been dabbling in for centuries.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio is panting and appetent, the force of fucking Agatha, of touching her, of loving her, has always left her out-of-sorts and wild, grabbing for more and more. And Agatha gives, takes and gives, let’s Rio swallow her whole.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s knee wedges between Rio’s legs. She is wet and sliding against her thigh, and the heat of her sends spirals of pleasure through her as she teems and cries out and scrapes her fingernails down Rio’s back. Their fucking grows desperate. It is soft still, but frenzied, Rio’s fingers curling into Agatha, the other hand pinning her wrist into the grass, her tongue in Agatha’s mouth, teeth around her bottom lip, Agatha’s free hand roaming ravenously down Rio’s back, her ribs, breasts, sides.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha inhales sharply, her body tensing as she cums. Rio smiles, moans, Agatha grabbing furiously at her body, pulling her down on top of her. Rio holds her tightly as she shudders, then softens. It is these few moments here, when the cramped hold of orgasm washed away and Agatha loosens, fills into the spaces between the two of them so easily, like water, that Rio cannot help but feel are her favorite.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha mumbles something incomprehensible, then pulls weakly at Rio, trying to move her up. Rio obliges, crawling up Agatha’s body, positioning herself over Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her fingernails dig into Rio’s hips, Agatha’s mouth works against her, her tongue sliding inside of her folds with an insistence, her lips on her clit, chin and nose and cheeks quickly drenched. Rio chuckles darkly, gasping as she rides Agatha’s face. A cold wind flushes around them and Rio shudders in contrast to the flaring heat rising inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha is all moans, so noisy, a humming and scratching mess under Rio who rocks and sighs. “You feel good, sweetheart,” Rio murmurs, and in response Agatha groans loudly into her, the vibrations purring into pleasure, and Rio mutters sweet nothings as she spills into a soft orgasm, her thighs squeezing around Agatha’s head.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They hold each other on the cool grass. Owls call distantly in the woods. Agatha’s head rests on Rio’s chest, and Rio winds the white lock of her hair around her fingers. They fall asleep here, nude and silent, their breaths matched to the rustle of wind across the grass, to each other’s heartbeats, and Agatha wonders as she drifts into sleep if it is Rio’s pulse that matches the beat of the earth, or the earth matching its tick to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Barefoot, gripping Rio’s hand, Agatha lets herself be led through the forest. It’s familiar in its unfamiliarity. Like a cruel joke, Agatha wonders just how surprised she is that it’s all so unrecognizable. So distant.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio hums happily, her pace brisk and light-footed. A strange churning feeling curls in Agatha’s stomach, but she follows Rio, shuffling through the mosses and leaves and dirt, listening contentedly to Rio sing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “To be honest, my darling,” Rio says, looking back at Agatha. There is a shine in her eyes. Agatha smiles softly. “I didn’t bring you to hunt. There’s a spot here. Come, come.” She giggles and begins to run, still holding tightly onto Agatha’s hand, and they are both chasing through the forest, flowing skirts and hair and effortlessness.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The wood thickens, the grass giving to soil and rock under their feet. Agatha hears running water, and then they’ve come to a small pool, spilled into by a small, fast moving waterfall. Rio gasps and laughs happily, releasing Agatha’s hand and without another word plunging herself into the water. Agatha yelps and flinches away from the splash.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio emerges laughing. Agatha sighs. The smile that she never quite is aware of works its way onto her face. She steps into the water, sitting at the edge, submerged at her ankles and waist, knees drawn to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Is this what you do all day? Go swimming?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pulls herself up to Agatha and kisses her, wetly, deeply. “I just like to listen to the waterfall. I was hoping you’d join me swimming?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pretends to think, then pushes Rio into the water and jumps in with her. She emerges with a gasp, and Rio climbs up her. They yell and fall back under.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha missed being in love. She had forgotten how it tasted. She kisses Rio, and then dunks her under the waterfall. The water is cold. They hold each other. It is everything. Agatha squeezes her tight, tightly, she can’t imagine what letting go feels like. She can’t imagine what it will feel like.

     Against a tree. Skirts hitched up to her hips. Agatha pressing Rio against a tree, Rio’s legs wrapped around her waist, grunting whisperingly as Agatha fucks her, thrusts harshly into her cunt, sucking hungrily at her neck. Rio claws at Agatha’s back, tugs painfully at her hair, a larger chunk now turned white. Rio whines, tightens, comes gasping Agatha’s name, and Agatha laughs meanly, pulling Rio off of the tree, setting her down in the grass, and ducking between her legs.
    </p>

     Wine, and lots of it. A bonfire, dancing and shouting and sprays of magic. Her hair now more white than brown, tumbling tresses down her back, Agatha spins and stumbles and crashes into Rio, and they both tip over into the grass.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rubs her face into the grass like it is a pillow, laughing, and when she opens her eyes and meets Rio’s, there is such a strange look. It is love, of course, this is not the strange part. There is always love. And there is sadness, deep, a knowledge that seems, for a moment, so beyond Agatha, and then she understands.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her time is soon. The choice will be made. Soon. The “choice”. Rio realized before she did. As always, really. Agatha laughs some more, a bit tired, a bit dogged, and sighs. Her eyes close and she faces back to the sky. Rio takes her hand and interlocks their fingers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I will always love you, Rio.” Agatha says. Rio curls into her like a child.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “I know,” she whispers back. Agatha feels a bit like a gently picked flower in the soft hands of a florist, spun between thumb and forefinger, colorful and beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     /
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In a mirror, Agatha braids and unbraids her hair. It is all white now, not a single strand of her dark brown to be found, and Rio has tried.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     A single candle flickers weakly. Their bedroom is dark, even with the moonlight trickling through their open window. She unbraids it, runs her fingers through its waves.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stands. She tries to be quiet. Rio’s breathing is soft, almost rhythmic. Agatha leans over the bed. She kisses Rio’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “One of these days, I’ll be inescapably yours. Until then, my love,” she whispers. Agatha steps out of their room, out of their cottage. She stands in the doorway, breathing in the scent of thyme and dried leaves. A buzzard, somewhere so far.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha takes a deep breath. An amused grin works its way on her face. She steps down, and down, and down.

      ofc i really hope we get their backstory from jac later, but i’m trying not to feel too optimistic abt it. this is my best shot at getting as close to canon as possible, with of course insane smut because i am only human after all. this will be mostly for naught if we do get more of these two and i’ll be so embarrassed but. ce la vie, nous sommes déjà là no?
