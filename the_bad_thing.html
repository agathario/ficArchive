     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Rio clicked her pen shut, set her notebook down on the side table next to her and leaned forward in her seat, resting her elbows on her knees before speaking. “I want you both to know that this only works if you want it to work. I’m here to facilitate a productive conversation between you two. To find a way through whatever it is that you may be struggling with. There are no right or wrong answers here, no one is the hero or the villain. So, please, I need you both to contribute in order to move forward.” Rio’s eyes flickered between the women as she spoke.
     </p>
<p>
      Wanda simply smiled and nodded.
     </p>
<p>
      Agatha rolled her eyes and scoffed under her breath something similar to “fucking hell.”
     </p>
<p>
      Rio had to hide her smirk. Oh this was gonna be fun.
     </p>
<p>
      OR
     </p>
<p>
      Rio is Agatha and Wanda's couples therapist and all three of them are lowkey bad people.

     Chapter 1
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     The first thing Rio noticed as she looked at the couple sitting across from her, were their appearances. Obviously. Wanda sat straight and rigid, hands clasped together in her lap, and a smile that was much too tight. She had her long red hair in a soft braid, a flowy white linen shirt hanging off her frame, and a pair of what looked to be vintage jeans on her bottom half. Her left hand sparkled with what could only be described as a massive fucking boulder and an accompanying wedding band. The picture of perfection, light makeup, not a hair out of place. As Rio shifted her eyes to the other side of the couch, she took in Wanda’s wife- Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     If Wanda was a summer day, gentle and warm, her wife was a goddamn hurricane. Agatha sat reclined against the back of the couch, legs sprawled out as if she was manspreading, with one hand gingerly slung over the armrest. She wore a white button up rolled to her elbows and black slacks, her dark, wavy locks unruly and cascading down her back. A gold watch sat on her wrist, and a silver band that matched Wanda’s on her finger. Unlike her wife, Agatha didn’t smile to keep up appearances, no. Agatha’s very deep blue eyes were boring holes into Rio’s soul, her mouth pressed into a straight line, like she was pissed Rio had the audacity to exist.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you both for coming today, I’m Doctor Rio Vidal. I’ve been practicing for a little over a decade, and I specialize in marital therapy. I’d like to begin today with something easy. So, tell me about yourselves.” Rio prompted, settling into her chair, grabbing a pen and pad.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Wanda immediately started. “I brought up the idea of counseling because-” And no, that’s not what Rio wanted to know, not yet anyways.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, Wanda, what I meant was tell me how you two met, fell in love, how long you’ve been together. It’s important to get the context of a couple first.” Rio gently corrected. She’d have plenty of time later to know why Agatha and Wanda were here today, in marriage counseling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, um-” Wanda stumbled. “Right, well we met at school. I was getting my PhD and Agatha was a professor. Not my professor,” She quickly corrected. “but I was there studying art history and Agatha teaches English so our paths crossed and the rest is history.” Wanda finished in a light tone that felt forced and an obviously fake smile that did not reach her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scribbled down some notes and looked to Agatha, who now was looking off to the side. “Agatha, would you like to add anything to Wanda’s story?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply shook her head without changing the direction of her gaze, studying the wall that held Rio’s multiple degrees and certifications.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rio prodded. It wasn’t the first time a patient refused to engage and it definitely wouldn’t be the last. Wanda was also looking at Agatha, and though Rio could see her jaw clenching out of annoyance, she was still smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhh?” Agatha finally turned to look at the other people in the room, eyes devoid of emotion. “No, nothing to add, that pretty much covers it.” Agatha replied in a neutral tone before looking back at the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve been together five years, married for three.” The redhead helpfully added. Rio didn’t like to judge her patients, in all her years as a therapist she prided herself on keeping an open mind. But jesus christ, these women hated each other, that much was already clear. And, god help her, Rio couldn’t wait to find out why.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clicked her pen shut, set her notebook down on the side table next to her and leaned forward in her seat, resting her elbows on her knees before speaking. “I want you both to know that this only works if you want it to work. I’m here to facilitate a productive conversation between you two. To find a way through whatever it is that you may be struggling with. There are no right or wrong answers here, no one is the hero or the villain. So, please, I need you both to contribute in order to move forward.” Rio’s eyes flickered between the women as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda simply smiled and nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and scoffed under her breath something similar to “fucking hell.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had to hide her smirk. Oh this was gonna be fun.
    </p>
<p>
     Sitting back in her chair, Rio picked up her pad and pen. "Now that we have that clear, what brings you in today?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda pounced. “We’ve been trying to get pregnant for two and a half years now. Five rounds of IVF and nothing to show for it. I wanted to start another round but Agatha wanted to give up. I’ve always dreamed of being a mom. The little onesies, christmas mornings,” As she continued, Rio looked at the brunette on the other side of the couch. Agatha’s long fingers were fidgeting, her full lips pursed, and her crystal blue eye damn near twitching. “And I know Agatha has reservations about being an older mom, but we talked about kids before we got married. I thought we were on the same page.” Agatha scoffed again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw her opening, “Agatha, something to add?” And that’s all it took.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a cold, almost cruel smile, “Our problems started long before a potential sixth round of IVF, Doc.” she gave a humorless laugh, and Wanda’s perfect smile finally cracked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you like to expand on that, Agatha?” Rio asked as she wrote more in her notebook. She heard a tired sigh before Agatha looked at Rio and continued “Wanda quit her job a couple years ago to stay home with the kids we were supposed to have by now. She was a brilliant gallery curator, a whole career in front of her, and then she just stopped. She quit her job because it's what she wanted. We bought a five bedroom house in the suburbs because it’s what she wanted. We tried a third, fourth, and fifth round of IVF despite medical professionals advising otherwise because it's what she wanted. We don’t talk, we don’t go out, we don’t touch. I have given everything I possibly can to her, and still the only thing she cares about is a goddamn imaginary child.” At this point Agatha’s voice was like stone, Rio nodded along and noticed Wanda holding back tears.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true, we talk.” Wanda quickly stated, eyes drilling into Agatha's side profile. Her wife just laughed and raised her hands as she spoke. “When’s the last time we talked and it didn’t result in a screaming match over fertility treatments? Or me working too much? Or going to fucking therapy?” Agatha spat back while motioning her hand at Rio for emphasis on her last point. Wanda just looked down at her hands and shook her head as she took in what her wife was saying.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the session was more or less the same. Wanda overcompensating and Agatha just sitting there completely checked out. Agatha didn’t contribute again. She just simply nodded or hummed at whatever Wanda said, and Rio couldn’t help but notice how the brunette across from her never let her guard down. Agatha’s shoulders stayed broad, her collarbones on display. Her neck elongated and stiff, every column in her throat visible. Her neck looked soft, her collarbones even softer, and- fuck Wanda was speaking and Rio was checking out- no. Staring- no. Looking (that was the right word). Looking at her wife. Not appropriate. Definitely not professional.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to have to stop you, unfortunately our time is up.” Rio politely interrupted Wanda mid sentence. There were technically a few minutes left of the session but after catching herself checking out one of her clients in front of said client’s wife (who was also a fucking client) Rio needed this to be over. She confirmed their next appointment and said her goodbyes to both of the women, watching as they exited and closed the door behind them. Rio slumped back in her chair, exhaling a breath of relief. She’d never found a client even remotely attractive before, or at least not enough to consider the softness of their collarbones. Which is how it fucking should be. No, this was fine, finding a patient attractive doesn't mean anything. Just as long as Rio didn’t act on it (she never would, she’s a professional), which would be easy enough with the patient’s wife in the room. As long as both Agatha and Wanda came to every appointment, there should be nothing to worry about at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Three days later Rio sat in her office, sipping coffee, waiting for Agatha and Wanda to show up, however when the door opened only Agatha was present. She all but strode into Rio’s office, hair flowing, heels clacking, legs on full display in a simple black dress and a confused expression on her face.
     <br/>
     “Where’s Wanda?” Agatha asked.
     <br/>
     I don’t know where your wife is, how the fuck would I know? The doctor quietly thought to herself. Instead of saying that out loud however, Rio kept a neutral face as she responded. “I was going to ask you the same question.” Do they not drive here together? Just then Agatha’s phone buzzed and she looked at the screen, smirking as she told Rio,
    </p>
<p>
     “Stuck in traffic, says she’ll be here in twenty.”
    </p>
<p>
     Twenty minutes alone with Agatha, Rio could do that without seeming awkward or like she was trying to hide something. Agatha sat down onto the couch, the same spot as three days prior, and crossed her legs. The skirt of her dress rode up ever so slightly as she did so, revealing the tiniest sliver of thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.

     Chapter 2
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Who the fuck wore a dress, bare legged, in Chicago in February? Apparently, Agatha did. She had to be cold, right? If she was, she didn’t show it as she looked around Rio’s office and waited for her wife’s arrival.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have a lot of plants.” Agatha stated.
    </p>
<p>
     Which, yes, Rio did. Her whole office was sprawling with different vegetation. Rio had painstakingly decorated the office to her taste. She loathed the clinical look of other psychiatrist’s offices, dull white walls, gray furniture, decades old carpeting, all around just deeply impersonal. Luckily, Lilia let every therapist at the practice express themselves through their workspace. Rio’s office was drenched in warm earth tones, a forest green couch, a rich auburn area rug, tall mahogany bookshelves that matched her desk. It made her feel comforted, and she hoped that it did the same for her patients. Alice, who worked down the hall from her, was much edgier with her décor. Basically emanating a psychedelic basement from the 70’s, which was a fine line to walk for an addiction therapist.  Lilia’s office was an estate sale waiting to happen, vintage furniture and countless antiques. Ironic considering Lilia, in addition to owning the practice, specialized in grief counseling. So yes, Rio had a whole ecosystem surrounding her as she worked, because, well, she could.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled as replied to Agatha. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wasn’t a compliment.” Agatha breathed out as she stood up again, shrugging off her jacket and slinging it over the back of the couch. Of course the dress was sleeveless, because why would anyone wear sleeves in negative three degree weather? Fuck, her arms were toned. The dress wasn’t even scandalous, it was probably Agatha’s work attire. The neckline was high and the fit was tailored, tailored very well in Rio’s opinion. For the love of god, stop thinking about a patient’s clothing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio expected Agatha to sit back down, but instead she started wandering around Rio’s office like it was the most natural thing in the world. She sauntered to the bookcase in the corner, no doubt judging what literature was sitting on the shelves. She didn’t say anything about it, just moved on to the next thing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it wise to have a collection of knives in a place where you treat unstable people?” Agatha was now pointing to the plethora of switchblades on the wall. An obscure hobby, sure, but Rio had been building her collection for years. Some were thrifted for next to nothing, others she spent far too much of her paycheck on. They hung in her office in a locked glass case anchored to the wall, they’d never been an issue before, most of her patients didn’t even notice them.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re daggers, not knives. And I mostly treat married couples.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha deadpanned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled against her better judgement. “No, I have never had any spouses stab each other in my office.” She responded, still smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shame.” And then she continued making her way around the small space, heels clacking away.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes followed her frame as she wondered what would intrigue the professor next.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why the flag?” Agatha pointed to the small orange, white, and pink pride flag sat on the entryway table next to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     She debated giving Agatha the long explanation, that she did a lot of pro bono counseling for LGBTQ youth through local shelters and organizations. Most were unhoused or low income, and Rio thought it was important for those kids to see a visibly queer person excelling in their career and life. It was a way to let the kids know that they were safe in her office, that she could relate to them in some tiny way.
    </p>
<p>
     The short answer was: Rio’s a lesbian. She settled for the latter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? You got a problem with lesbians?” Rio teased. And Agatha actually fucking chuckled, albeit a small one, but Rio wanted to see it to happen again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m married to a woman.” She countered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Agatha, I’m aware.” Rio smiled as she stated the obvious. “But I don’t know how you identify, I don’t want to assume.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why does everyone need a label now? Just fuck who you want and let it be.” The older woman moved her hands as she spoke, emphasizing her point.
    </p>
<p>
     And oh, Agatha definitely did not realize the floodgates she just opened. Because that way of thinking was usually taught, usually drilled into someone’s head while they’re still young and impressionable.  “Did you grow up extremely repressed by any chance, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     She let out an annoyed huff as she answered, “Just when I thought we could speak like normal fucking people.” She threw her head back like a petulant child about to throw a tantrum. Still, Rio pushed on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me guess. WASP upbringing? Maybe presbyterian? Overbearing parental figure? My money would be on your mother based on how you present yourself and your reaction to the use of the term lesbian.” Rio left them as open ended questions but she had worked with enough religiously traumatized queer kids to know she was right.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood there, mouth agape, staring at Rio. She snapped her jaw closed after a moment and crossed her arms. “It was catholicism.” She ground out through her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     Close enough. Rio loved being right.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmhh.” The doctor hummed with satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, do not act smug, you could throw a pebble into a crowd of lesbians and hit one with mommy issues. They’re everywhere.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why am I throwing rocks at lesbians? Do you think you have mommy issues, Agatha? Are you implying that you identify as a lesbian?” Rio asked in quick succession of one another as she pulled out her pen and notebook. Might as well try and make some progress while they wait.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is why everyone hates shrinks, they're the most pretentious motherfuckers alive. And I’m saying that as an English professor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you always deflect when you’re asked tough questions?”
    </p>
<p>
     “See?” Agatha raised her hand before slapping them back down against her sides. “Pretentious!” She raised her hand to the bridge of her nose, which looked like it was straight out of renaissance painting, and closed her eyes as if she was trying to compose herself. She checked her watch on her other hand, counting down the minutes until Wanda arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can come back to those questions.” Rio wanted to keep pushing, but instead acquiesced, scribbling her findings down on the paper before her. As she wrote, she felt glare from across the room. She didn’t want to give Agatha the satisfaction but she also couldn’t look down at her notebook forever. When she peered up, just as suspected, Agatha’s steely blue gaze was locked on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I have a question,” Suddenly Agatha was grinning, eyes lit up with mischief. “Why were you staring at my chest last session?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s stomach dropped. Fuck, she had noticed. Well, sort of, it was technically her collarbones, but Rio could see how Agatha had drawn her conclusion. Did Wanda notice too? Did they talk about it at home afterwards? No, Wanda wouldn’t have agreed to another appointment if she thought their marital therapist was preying on her wife. But, then again, Wanda wasn’t here. Maybe there was no traffic and Agatha was about to ruin Rio’s entire career. A career she had worked tirelessly for. A career that she actually enjoyed, one that fulfilled her. A career she was good at, and she threw it all away to stare at a very hot woman. God, how fucking stupid could she be? Very, apparently.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry?” Rio responded in a tone that feigned ignorance, though her voice came out scratchy from how dry her mouth was now. Plausible deniability was the only way out of this. She’d play dumb.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do not gaslight me. I don't think that would ‘facilitate a positive conversation’ or whatever bullshit you said last appointment. “ Agatha’s posture was tall and confident now, seemingly finding power in this confrontation.  “On Tuesday? When you thought I was zoned out, you stared at my chest. For a while too.” Agatha’s grin only got wider, she looked like a cat about to play with a mouse she'd found in the backyard. “Gotta say, Doc, I’m flattered.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s mouth rapidly shut and opened, trying and failing to find what response was appropriate in this situation.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no appropriate response.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio should have expected Agatha to call her on her bluff.
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax. Wanda didn’t notice. That would require her caring about something outside of herself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not relax. Her heart was pounding and her body was vibrating with anxiety. Oh, maybe she was fucking dying. That didn’t sound so bad at this moment, she even welcomed it. She took deep breaths to refocus her breathing while staring at Agatha. No. Looking. She was looking at Agatha. She had to work harder at making that distinction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at the clock, they killed about ten minutes. Rio could survive another ten. She let out one last shaky breath and spoke, “I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Agatha. That was truly not my intention and I understand if you and Wanda want to find a different psychiatrist. I have some excellent referrals I can pass along to you two.” Brief, concise, and detached.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “Why would I want a referral? You gawking at me made therapy bearable. Fun, even.”
    </p>
<p>
     What. The. Fuck?
    </p>
<p>
     ‘She either has to be genuinely unhinged or fucking with me.’ Rio debated in her head. Agatha started advancing across the distance of the office, stopping in front of Rio. The doctor was now looking up at her client from where she sat in her chair. She decided not to explore why she liked Agatha towering over her like this, different issue to unpack on a different day. The two women simply just made eye contact for who knows how long, it felt really long to Rio. Her breath, which had just evened out, became choppy again. But she needed to say something, respond to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rio spoke softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?” The other woman countered, lowering down so that each of her arms were resting on either side of the chair. Bracketing Rio in as their faces became level with each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re married.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m your therapist.” Rio recalled, heart pounding. Palms sweating.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So then what the hell are you doing right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t fucking know.” She whispered, azure eyes flickering to full lips.
    </p>
<p>
     No, Rio was not this person. She was not a person who would be an accessory to adultery, she was not a person who would take advantage of someone she had power over. No, she was not whoever was sitting in this chair right now, crumbling at the prospect of kissing a married woman. That's what she had to keep telling herself. No matter if it was a lie. No matter how much she ached to close the distance. Quickly, she looked at the clock then back at the woman cornering her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your wife will be here any minute.” She mustered as much false confidence as she could manage. “I think you should sit back down and wait for her so we can begin the session.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked. Her eyes no longer dilating, but clouding over with understanding. She didn’t respond, just straightened back up as she stood. Wordlessly turning around and heading for the couch. Sitting back down and looking at Rio, crossing her legs and folding her hands in her lap. Her wedding band shining in the soft light filtering through the window.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled a breath she didn’t know she had been holding.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat there, looking- no. Staring at each other in silence for a minute or two before the door opened.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda rushed in and onto the couch, the opposite side from her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “God, sorry I’m late. You know how it is getting on the highway on a game day.” Wanda deeply exhaled in one big string. “The Bears never make the superbowl, why do so many people care? Anyways, what did I miss? What are we talking about?” Slipping her manufactured smile across her face.
    </p>
<p>
     How the hell was Rio supposed to survive this?

     Chapter 3
    </p>
<p>
     She had to give credit where credit is due, Doctor Vidal spent the remainder of the session completely unphased. The picture of professionalism. Their time was almost up when Rio opened her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “When’s the last time you felt happy in your relationship?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mind reeled. When had she last been happy? Or merely even content? It felt like eons ago. She thought back to the earlier days of her and Wanda’s relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     They were naked and tangled in Agatha’s bed, back in her townhouse in Wicker Park. They’d been together maybe a few months, Wanda hadn’t completed her PhD yet and it was late in the morning. “Hon, I gotta get dressed. I have a lecture in half an hour, and I have to shower.” She’d croaked as Wanda continued to kiss along the side of her neck. “Noooo,” Wanda whined as she moved to the older woman’s collarbones. “Just cancel class and stay here.” They had been at it the whole night prior, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. “I can’t cancel my classes every time you wanna fuck me, I’d never get anything done.” Wanda giggled and moved lower, taking one of Agatha’s nipples in her mouth and sucking lightly. Agatha moaned and arched her back in response, threading her fingers through ginger hair. “You don’t seem to mind that prospect right now.” She was insatiable as she moved over Agatha’s ribs, abdomen, hips. She grinned as she dipped her head between the professor’s thighs, knowing she had won. And she did, Agatha had canceled her lecture that morning, favoring to spend the day wrapped up in Wanda. Now though, she couldn’t remember the last time she had touched her wife like that, spent a day ignoring the world so she could keep fucking the woman she once was so enamored by.
    </p>
<p>
     She was happy when Wanda got her doctorate, when she had gotten her dream job at a prestigious gallery. She was happy when Wanda had accepted her proposal. “Why’d you get a ring so big?” She had asked through joyful tears. They stood in Millenium Park on a summer day, it had been so perfect. “Because I want all the pompous artists you work with to know you’re taken before they inevitably hit on you.” Agatha smirked as she responded, she used to be jealous about that kind of thing, about other people drooling over her partner. “That was one time, and I told you his work was mediocre at best.” Wanda said as she pressed a kiss to her now fiancée's lips. “Better safe than sorry.” Agatha muttered back, smiling into another kiss. Everything used to be so easy, so effortless.
    </p>
<p>
     Their wedding day was a happy one. Growing up, Agatha never dreamed she would be able to marry another woman without the threat of eternal damnation. The formal affair was small, intimate, minimal family but so many friends. Back when they had friends, back when they used to host dinner parties and go out, back when the couple had a whole network of people who knew them. They kissed at the altar, danced at the reception, and drank far too much champagne. “Why the fuck did I think a corseted wedding dress would be comfortable enough to wear all day?” Wanda asked after they left the venue, tugging at the fabric drunkenly. Agatha snorted and reached around to what seemed like thousands of tiny buttons on the back of her wife’s dress. She placed a peck on her wife’s exposed shoulder as she tried to free the woman that she felt so much love for in that moment. “Because you looked absolutely stunning in it, and you knew wearing something this tight would drive me insane.” She murmured low against the redhead's ear before all but ripping the dress off, buttons clattering to the floor. “God, I love you.” Wanda responded breathlessly as she turned in Agatha’s arms to kiss her. “I love you too, hon.” Currently, their wedding photos hang in the foyer, mocking Agatha every morning as she leaves for work.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about happiness is, it’s fleeting. Nobody just wakes up one day super fucking miserable out of the blue. It’s the incremental changes over time.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew things would get bad after Pietro died. They hadn’t even been married a year, and it was a freak accident. “I-I,” Wanda struggled to get her words out through her cries. “I just spoke to him yesterday.” Another scream, another sob. “We had plans! We had plans this weekend!” More wailing ensued, and Agatha just held her. She knew things would get bad, she just didn’t know that they’d continue to get worse. After Pietro’s funeral, it’s like a light switched in Wanda’s brain. Suddenly, she was booking appointments at fertility clinics, researching what doctor in their area had the highest success rate, tracking her ovulation cycle.
    </p>
<p>
     They discussed kids, sure, but Agatha was under the impression that they had time before starting on anything. But her wife was grief stricken, talking about how desperately she wanted a family. At that point in time Agatha foolishly thought Wanda’s crusade was temporary, so she agreed. In lieu of the grief counseling Agatha suggested, (Which is saying something considering she was raised to think therapy is a scam and prayer was the only solution to life’s problems.) Wanda threw herself into family planning. She resigned from the job she’d gone to school for a decade to get, started hormone shots, and picked a house in the suburbs outside the city. That stupid fucking five bedroom house in a souless cul-de-sac, where people cared about how vibrant one’s azaleas looked. They still owned the townhouse in the city, with its exposed brick, prewar hardwood floors, and original crown molding. Agatha loved that townhouse, she poured her heart and soul into making it hers. Then Wanda wanted a house. One on a quiet street where kids could ride their bikes, or play in the yard, run around under a sprinkler. Agatha hadn’t realized she agreed to a suburban hellscape when she agreed to kids.
    </p>
<p>
     After the second round of failed IVF, Agatha suggested that they slow down and take a break. “I’m not giving up, the doctor said most women need three rounds to get pregnant.” Wanda was smiling as she said it, but it was fake, it was hollow. “I’m not saying we give up, but hon, you’re sore all the time. You need a break from injecting yourself with needles and driving yourself crazy.” She had meant it to come off as reassurance, but Wanda didn’t take it that way. “I’m not fucking crazy for not wanting to give up! Why are you always so quick to dismiss the things that are important to me?” Now her wife was yelling, it didn’t take much to get Wanda pissed off with all the hormones pumping through her. So, they did another round,  then another, and another. Each time Wanda didn’t end up pregnant was harder than the last, sobbing, screaming, fighting. Wanda resented Agatha for not being as invested as her. Agatha resented Wanda for everything. For the house, her job, for acting as though Agatha by herself wasn’t enough to make Wanda satisfied. By that point in time, they no longer touched. No longer had those friends, no longer slept on the same side of their king sized bed. Wanda pretended they were fine, so Agatha did too.
    </p>
<p>
     She still stayed in the townhouse from time to time, if she had an early morning and didn’t want to commute into the city, or if she stayed on campus too late and didn't want to drive all the way back home. However, she found that if she spent anymore than a handful of days there a month, Wanda would accuse her of using the apartment as a place to fuck undergrads. Was her wife projecting? Agatha suspected so. Contrary to what had happened with their marriage therapist earlier, Agatha did not step outside her marriage. She had thought about it, contemplated it, more than enough bright-eyed twenty-something English students had made their interest in the professor clear. But ultimately, she couldn’t find it in herself to cheat on her wife whose only apparent crime was just wanting a family. And Agatha wasn’t perfect in their marriage, far from it. She knew she shut down or fled when things got hard. She worked too much, as the head of the English department she was buried in meetings and responsibilities. So why does she get to step out and leave Wanda in the dark? She doesn’t. Still, when Rio looked at her like that during their last appointment, Agatha had felt something she had long thought died. Wanting. Wanting to be desired, wanting to be challenged.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t going to bring it up to Rio. Just chalk it up to ‘still having it’ and moving on, but then Rio had to psychoanalyze her. Had to see Agatha for who she was.
     <br/>
     In some deeply sick and twisted way, Evanora would probably be satisfied to know that her daughter had manipulated a shrink. “They’re quacks, Agatha. You just need to pray harder.” Is what her mother would ramble. Probably wouldn’t love that it was sexual manipulation and that the shrink was a woman, but still, small wins. Her mother was a vicious woman, strict, cold, unwavering. Evanora’s love was conditional and never let Agatha forget it. Religion and a pretty firm backhand was the answer to everything in the Harkness household. Mental health didn’t exist, but if someone struggled, that just meant God was giving his toughest battle to his strongest soldier. Agatha’s struggle, according to mommy dearest, was her sexuality. Catholic school was her mother’s answer, and while Agatha hated it, she did not hate the skirts and how easily a hand could slide under them while ducking behind the bleachers. The only good thing Evanora ever did for her daughter was leaving behind a handsomely sized trust fund when she died. Which she promptly spent on building a life with another woman. ‘Fuck you mother, rot in hell’ was often what ran through her mind as she made the purchases.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     So…
    </p>
<p>
     “When’s the last time you felt happy in your relationship?” Was a loaded question for Rio to ask as they sat in the doctor’s office. The doctor that was achingly beautiful, full lips and the biggest brown eyes known to man. Her hair parted in the middle with curtain bangs perfectly quaffed, Agatha wanted to run her hands through it, it looked so silky. A tight green long sleeve clung to Rio’s frame, and fitted black trousers that Agatha could imagine peeling off. She was genuinely attracted to Rio, the manipulation was just a bonus. Anything to get out of therapy, anything to stop the feeling of being under a microscope. Anything to be able to ignore the state of her life and her marriage.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel happy everyday married to Agatha.” Wanda murmured softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Liar.
    </p>
<p>
     She did not feel happy everyday, she knew it and Agatha knew it. Why Wanda wanted to come to therapy if she was just going to make shit up, Agatha didn’t know. The room felt suffocating as Rio and Wanda turned their attention to the giant, repressed elephant in the room, awaiting her answer. She always liked being the center of attention, just maybe not in this instance.
    </p>
<p>
     She wracked her brain for a quip, something witty, to deflect with humor. But thinking back, she couldn’t remember. Why would she? She didn’t know the last time would be the last time when it was happening. She was tired. So, so tired. She let out a breath as she let the truth escape through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know.”
    </p>
<p>
     She kept her head straightforward as she spoke, but she could imagine the hurt on her wife’s face after hearing it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wrote something in the notebook Agatha despised so fucking much and looked up at the couple to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to give you guys some homework to do before our next session. I want you to go out together, a date. Dinner, a movie, dancing, something. And while you’re out, no discussion of kids and no placing blame. Talk to one another without the weight of the expectations you have placed on yourselves. Spend time together because you are choosing to do so, not because you feel obligated. Do you think you can do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Wanda nodded in silence at the request.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good. That wraps up our time for today, but I look forward to hearing the results on Tuesday.” Rio dismissed them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her jacket back on and slipped out the door into the hallway of the practice. She didn’t look but she knew Wanda was behind her. They reached the parking garage without a word uttered between them. As Agatha reached her car, she turned to face Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “Headed back to campus?” Her wife asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. Uh, department huddle.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay. See you at home.” Wanda sounded exhausted as she replied and turned to move towards her own car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped and turned back around to face Agatha. “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When was the last time you felt happy in our relationship?”
    </p>
<p>
     She could see Wanda smile that artificial smile before tears welled in her eyes. The smile dropped, almost as if she couldn’t find it in herself to keep up the facade any longer today.
    </p>
<p>
     “I honestly can’t remember.” Is the answer her wife supplied.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, at least they’re both suffering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have a good rest of your day at work, Agatha.” Wanda walked the rest of the way to her car, leaving Agatha standing next to her own.
    </p>
<p>
     She climbed in, started it, closed her eyes and let her head fall atop the steering wheel.
    </p>
<p>
     She missed being happy.

     Chapter 4
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha and Wanda were gone, Rio picked up her coffee mug and bolted out of her office. She should drop them as patients, right? She almost just kissed the woman whose marriage she was supposed to be trying to save. That constitutes dropping a patient, right? She’s being unethical, she’s being stupid. Her mind was racing as she made her way down the hallway to the staff break room. And Agatha just sat there for the remaining forty minutes like nothing had transpired before her wife’s arrival. Was she a fucking sociopath? How does someone compartmentalize to the extreme of a degree? Probably from the trauma inflicted upon her by her mother growing up. ‘Stop diagnosing the married woman you almost tongued.’ Rio chastised herself. As she reached the room, she saw Alice sitting at the communal table, paperwork sprawled out, deep in thought. Rio came behind her, lowered her head behind Alice’s and whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you wanna go out tonight and get super hammered?” Alice jumped at the sudden intrusion before laughing. Alice and Rio met through the practice, Lilia hired Alice about a year after she hired Rio. They’d been inseparable ever since, having friends who understood just how taxing this field of work is was rare.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re really gonna ask that to an addiction therapist?” Alice teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked around the table to the coffee pot before responding. “I’m sorry officer, I thought I was talking to my dear friend, Alice. Not a fucking narc.” Rio sarcastically retorted. Rio needed a distraction from Agatha, from Agatha and Wanda, from the very inappropriate thoughts she was having about half of the married couple she was meant to be treating. She topped up her coffee before joining Alice at the table. “Please? We haven’t gone out in so long and I need a distraction from the soul-sucking couple I’m counseling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that the lesbian couple where one looks like a teddy bear and the other looks like a snake about to rip off the teddy bear’s head with her bare teeth? I just saw them in the hallway.” Alice questioned with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that’s the one.” Rio groaned. She would happily let Agatha bite her head off, or bite anything of hers, really.
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn, that bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, I say this with the utmost care and professionalism– they’re doomed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know that from just two sessions?”
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Because one is a Stepford wife and the other just tried to seduce me.’ Is what Rio wanted to scream at the top of her lungs. “Because I’m very good at my job.” is what Rio actually said as she sipped her coffee. “So, drinks? Boystown?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice sighed, but relented. “Fine, I’ll go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and jumped in her seat. “Yes, thank you, Alice!”
    </p>
<p>
     “But I’m bringing the girl I’ve been seeing.”
    </p>
<p>
     She quirked an eyebrow at Alice. “You’re still seeing the teacher? That’s the longest one yet to date. Must be special.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice blushed as she recalled the woman. “What can I say, I like her. She’s so intelligent and confident, and the sex is-”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no, I love you but I do not want to know about how great this woman is at throwing you around the bedroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you assume I’m the one being thrown?”
    </p>
<p>
     She scoffed. “Al….” Rio started in an incredulous tone. “Who’s being thrown?” Lilia asked as she burst into the break room. Rio choked on her coffee from laughing at Lilia’s obliviousness, Alice turned a darker shade of red.
    </p>
<p>
     “No one! Uh,” Alice tried composing herself. “Rio was just talking about how this couple she’s treating is throwing her off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Son of a bitch, now Lilia was looking at Rio expectantly, waiting for elaboration. She had just gotten off the topic of Agatha and Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wife number one can barely show a real emotion, has an obvious anxious attachment style. I think she’s overcompensating for something and is trying to use babies and a white picket fence to cope. She’s crippled by her own self-doubt. Wife number two is unhinged, avoidant, detached, and wants to burn the aforementioned white picket fence to the ground. Also, I’m thinking there might be some infidelity, but I can’t be sure yet.” Rio did not specify that she kinda sorta participated in the suspected infidelity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yikes.” Was the advice Lilia gave her in return before grabbing tea from the cabinet of the small kitchenette.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, my fellow mental health professionals, for all of your wise words.” Rio deadpanned to Lilia and Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me know if one of them starts using, then I’ll help.” Alice said, now looking back down at her papers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or if one of them kills the other and needs grief counseling in prison.” Lilia added while steeping her tea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly? That seems like a very real possibility with this couple.”
    </p>
<p>
     “At least then you wouldn’t have to keep treating them.” Alice teased.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Much later, Rio found herself three drinks deep with Alice at one of the numerous gay bars near Wrigley field in the neighborhood of Boystown. She couldn’t find it in herself to get too dolled up for a night out, so she kept the same shirt she wore to work and switched her pants for a short(ish) black skirt. Except she wore tights with it like a normal fucking person would in a midwestern winter. The drinks were shitty, the music was deafening, and she had already spent way too much money tipping drag queens. It was just what she needed to forget about her day and that blue eyed succubus with amazing hair and legs that she’d love to wrap around her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Or, she could wrap her legs around Agatha’s head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio??”
    </p>
<p>
     But, if she went down on Agatha, then Rio would be able to hear all of the delicious noises that the older woman would make. God, she could only imagine what Agatha’s moans would sound like.
    </p>
<p>
     “RIO.” Was shouted into her ear as she was brought back to the present. The voice screaming her name belonged to Alice. That’s right, she was in a public place with another person.
    </p>
<p>
     “WHAT?” Rio snapped her head in Alice's direction.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said, Jen should be here any minute.”
    </p>
<p>
     Who?
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The woman I’m dating.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ohhhhh right, that meant that Rio was about to be ditched within the next hour so that her best friend could go get laid.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice continued, “She said she’s bringing a friend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yay.” Rio said flatly. She wanted to get drunk, go home, and pass out until noon the next day. Was it a healthy coping mechanism? No. Did she care at this moment? Also, no. She didn’t want to meet anyone, not after today's session. She then felt Alice tugging on her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, there she is, Jen over here!” Alice waved her other arm and raised her voice through the crowded bar. Rio saw a woman emerge from the crowd, the woman who she assumed was Jen. However, she didn’t have the time to form an impression of Jen before her eyes fell to the woman behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She was in black jeans, black boots, and a loose, mauve tank top. The top looked soft, like it was made of silk. Her hair was down and Rio noticed the absence of a bra. She should not be noticing that. Her throat closed and her eyes widened as she finished taking in the appearance of the woman slowly heading towards her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice!” Rio whisper shouted. She had maybe thirty seconds before Jen and Agatha reached them through the sea of bodies that packed the space.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen’s friend, the one walking over here right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, obviously confused despite having seen Agatha in passing before. “What about her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s the fucking snake lesbian, Al. She’s wife number two!”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s eyes widened to match Rio’s in recognition.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, babe.” Jen greeted as she gave Alice a quick kiss and motioned to Agatha. “Alice, this is Agatha. We teach together at Columbia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Alice squeaked out and gave an awkward wave, to which Agatha gave a polite smile in return before zeroing in on Rio. Nobody spoke for a minute, but Jen was obviously waiting for Alice to introduce the woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s up? I’m Rio.” She helpfully supplied, taking mercy on her friend.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, I’m Jen. Nice to put a face to the name, Alice talks about you all the time. I’m pretty sure you’re her only friend.” Jen joked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well that makes sense since she’s my only friend.” Rio sardonically replied, avoiding eye contact with Agatha. “I’m gonna go get another drink, does anyone need anything?” Alice and Jen shook their heads and Rio made a beeline for the bar, thinking she’d bought herself a few minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll come with you.” She heard from the voice that haunted her. And suddenly, Agatha was walking right alongside Rio. As soon as they were out of Jen and Alice’s line of sight, Agatha grabbed Rio’s wrist and yanked her the direction opposite from the bar. She didn’t listen to Rio’s protests or questions of where she was being taken, just kept pulling until they reached the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what the hell?!” Rio pressed as she was flung into the restroom. It was a single stall with a lockable door, which Agatha immediately took advantage of. Nothing good could be happening right now, nothing that would end well.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t say anything, she just stalked towards Rio until she had the doctor pinned against the sink, the cool tile biting into her lower back. She held Rio’s gaze as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me to stop, and I will.” Her tone was low and dangerous, like she was restraining herself. Her hands came to rest on Rio’s hips, firm and without hesitance.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel Agatha’s chest pressed against her own, smell her perfume, see every line on her face. She was so beautiful. She couldn’t get the words out, she knew she should but she couldn’t find the willpower.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me, Rio.” Blue eyes dropped to her lips for the second time that day, and Rio broke.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t stop.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha collided with Rio the moment the words left her mouth, taking one hand off her waist and placing it on the back of Rio’s neck for leverage as she dove in. And just as Rio thought, Agatha was a hurricane. She kissed Rio like she was claiming her, consuming her. She ran her tongue along Rio’s upper lip before deepening the kiss, causing Rio to fucking moan as she felt Agatha’s tongue against her own. She couldn’t help herself, her hands dropped to the married woman's ass as she greedily took whatever Agatha would let her have. She then felt lithe hands grip underneath her thighs and hoist her on top of the counter connected to the sink. Rio spread her legs to accommodate the other woman who was now making a move towards Rio’s neck. She happily granted her access by tipping her head back and resting it against the mirror behind her. She felt teeth scrape against the soft spot behind her ear before hearing a breathy, “So fucking perfect.” from Agatha. All Rio could do in response was claw at the other woman’s shoulders and let out a whimper at the praise.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth was at Rio’s throat, kissing, biting, nipping. She felt one hand duck under her shirt up towards her chest, as another steadily inched under her skirt. Jesus Christ, this woman was invading every part of Rio, her senses were completely gone. One of Agatha’s hands slipped under Rio’s bra to palm at her breast before pinching her nipple. Rio arched into the woman in front of her and moaned, probably far too loud for a public space, but she was too preoccupied to care.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha moved back to Rio’s mouth, giving her one last filthy kiss before- Oh god, before dropping to her fucking knees. She made no move to gently peel off Rio’s tights, no. Just grabbed at where the fabric sat at the apex of Rio’s thighs and ripped them until she was satisfied. She hiked Rio’s skirt around her hips to afford her more room. When she looked back up at Rio, there was barely any blue left in her eyes, just pupils blown wide. Fuck, she needed her mouth right now.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at the woman worshipping her with half lidded eyes. She couldn’t fucking breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was kissing languidly up her thighs, some parts still had fabric clinging to them, other parts didn’t. Her hands fastened to Rio’s hips as she yanked the younger woman closer to the edge of the sink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be a doll and hold my hair back for me, baby.” Agatha commanded as she moved soaked black underwear aside and descended between Rio’s legs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!” Rio hissed as she felt Agatha’s tongue sweep through her before sucking on her clit, not enough to do anything but just enough to tease. Rio threw her hands forward to thread through the most divine head of hair she’d ever seen and hold Agatha’s locks away from her face. She had ordered Rio so nicely.
    </p>
<p>
     Only when Rio had complied with her request did Agatha speed up, subsequently feeling Rio’s grip tighten in her hair. Her tongue working faster, adding more pressure. Agatha moaned at Rio’s taste, the sounds she made, the way her thighs started shaking around Agatha’s head. She brought two of her fingers underneath her chin and sunk them into the already writhing woman above her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuc- Agatha, fuck.” Was all Rio could pant out as she felt those deliciously long fingers start fucking her, curling at the same pace as her tongue circling her clit. Her eyes were screwed shut as she let Agatha take whatever she wanted from her. "I, I can't-"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was pretty sure she was about to be burned alive under Agatha touch, or maybe that was just the guilt of receiving head from a married woman. No, she couldn’t feel like the worst person alive right now, not as Agatha’s fingers were gaining speed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at me.” Agatha said, mouth briefly leaving Rio, but fingers continuing.
    </p>
<p>
     God help her, Rio had never obeyed so quickly, eyes snapping open and locking onto Agatha below her. She could see the silver wedding band on Agatha’s left hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you wanna come for me?” Agatha’s voice was hoarse.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I wanna come for you, Agatha.” Rio moaned out, clenching around the fingers that were now pressing against that one perfect fucking spot over, and over.
    </p>
<p>
     “Beg.”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, Rio understood now. Agatha wasn’t unhinged or a sociopath, she was just a fucking sadist. Unfortunately, the humiliation didn’t deter Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     That shouldn’t be as hot as it is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, Agatha, please, pl-” Rio trailed off as her voice cracked and Agatha sped her digits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come around my fingers, baby.” Agatha hadn’t even finished her sentence before adding her mouth back to Rio’s clit and sucking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s back bowed against the mirror on the wall as the tension in her body finally snapped, letting out a silent scream as she shattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stayed planted between Rio’s legs as she came, mouth and fingers still moving until Rio’s body stopped vibrating, until her hands went limp against Agatha’s scalp. The older woman then stood up and kissed Rio again before whispering in her ear. “Gimme your phone.” And Rio doesn't know why she just dumbly hands it over to her, maybe it was all the blood flow going to her cunt right now instead of her brain.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha does that stupid bluetooth thing where she taps her phone against Rio’s and gets her contact info. Fuck whoever at Apple invented that because Rio can’t stop it from happening. Her head feels fuzzy and she’s pretty sure her limbs are made of lead. Agatha moved the now useless pair of panties back to their original place, slid Rio’s skirt back down, and adjusted her tights to make them slightly more presentable. She gave Rio her phone and placed a hand on the back of Rio’s head before placing a tender kiss on her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “See you Tuesday, Doc.” And walked out of the bathroom, leaving Rio panting and confused.
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking snake lesbian.

     Chapter 5
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hastily left the bathroom and made her way back over to Jen and Alice, making sure to swipe her mouth and chin clean with the back of her hand before reaching the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Finally, we thought you died with how long you’ve been gone.” Jen said, almost side-eyeing Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Rio?” Alice asked innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to get out of this bar before Rio confronted her about what the hell she had just done in the bathroom not even five minutes ago. Luckily, Agatha had a head start seeing as she’s pretty sure Rio can’t move her legs in the current moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s in the bathroom. Her and I had a heart-to-heart about the elephant in the room, and I think I’m gonna go home. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable when she’s supposed to be having fun.” Agatha lied through her fucking teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s really mature of you, Agatha.” Jen scoffed, like she didn’t believe Agatha was being genuine. And to her credit, she wasn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “What can I say? I’m a giver.”
    </p>
<p>
     In more ways than one.
    </p>
<p>
     "Text me when you’re home safe.” Jen said in place of an actual goodbye, too busy turning back to her infatuation with Alice. Stupid fucking honeymoon stage.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha reached her car, she thought about staying at the townhouse tonight, but knew no excuse would make sense. It was a Friday night, no classes the next morning to blame her absence on. So, she drove almost an hour back to the suburbs, and thought. Thought about how she hadn’t been that turned on in literal years, how next time they needed to do it somewhere with a bed. Where Agatha could take her time with Rio, make her squirm, be able to hear her scream. Hold her after, fall asleep with her, embed herself in that heavenly little crook between Rio’s jaw and shoulder. She needed there to be a next time, her marriage be damned. And in all fairness, her marriage was damned. Doomed, even.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha pulled into the driveway of her home, Wanda’s car wasn’t there. Weird, since Agatha had told her wife she was going out, but Wanda didn’t communicate anything to her about doing the same. Agatha took this as a free pass, she sent Jen the text, she sprinted into the house, upstairs to the master bedroom, and into the accompanying ensuite. She pulled her clothes off as quickly as she could without tearing them, and hopped into the shower. Not to do anything sexual, of course. She just needed to shower after such a long day. Plus, she’d been in public. Plus, she had run away before she could tell if Rio wanted to return the favor.
    </p>
<p>
     She definitely did not use the showerhead between her own legs and think back to Rio spread open on the counter in the bar. The way her neck glistened with Agatha’s spit and bloomed with hickies. She couldn’t wait to see how Rio chose to cover those marks come Tuesday, her money’s on a turtleneck. Or how her deathgrip on Agatha’s hair right at the root almost made Agatha come without hardly any touch at all. The way Rio’s back arched, the softness of her skin. God, her whimpers, her moans, all the tiny sounds that she made while Agatha was drowning in her cunt. How Rio immediately complied with every single one of Agatha’s orders. Her mind swam in nothing but Rio, Rio, Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuuuck.” Agatha breathed out when her own self-induced orgasm crashed through her, gripping the tiled wall for stability.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, like all good things, Agatha’s solitude ended. She heard the front door open and close downstairs before the sound of heels against the hardwood staircase. She quickly placed the showerhead back on the wall and finished her (completely innocent) shower routine.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got out of the shower and wrapped up in a towel, she met her wife in the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where were you all night, hon?” Agatha said, keeping her tone light. Her wife was in the process of taking off her shoes, but judging from the attire, Wanda had gone out for drinks tonight too.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, well, Monica asked me if I wanted to meet up with her tonight, and I figured, why not?” Wanda replied, now standing up and working off her dress.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like, ‘Monica from your old gallery job’ Monica?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she, uh-” Wanda paused, finished taking off her dress and crossed their bedroom to the dresser where their pjs were stored. Unfolding an old Columbia sweater and sweatpants, Wanda continued. “She wants me to come back. To work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Despite what happened with Rio tonight, or how Agatha felt towards Wanda most days, she was happy for her wife. Wanda had always been brilliant and it made her sad to see Wanda essentially regress after Pietro. “That’s great.” Agatha said smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I’m going to do it, but it’s nice to be flattered a little with free drinks.”  Wanda giggled, now fully dressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should.” Agatha wanted to elaborate further, but didn't want to risk prolonging this conversation and risk it turning into a fight. Like most of their conversations nowadays.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still standing in a towel and just now realized, she was naked underneath and Wanda had just been half-naked in front of her getting dressed, and neither of them made a move to do anything. Not a kiss, not a tease, not even a flirt. Three years ago, they would have already been on top of one another.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha moved  back to the ensuite to hang her towel and slip on a robe, she heard Wanda’s voice carry from their bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been thinking a lot about Dr. Vidal,” Wanda made her way to lean against the door frame as Agatha started her very meticulous skincare routine.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Yeah me fucking too.’ Agatha thought, glancing over at her wife as a courtesy.
    </p>
<p>
     “About her homework for us. And what if we go to, like, the Shedd Aquarium or something? We haven’t been in forever. Or that tiny little hole in the wall Italian restaurant we used to love? Oh, or-”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes caught it then as Wanda was speaking. “Wanda, where are your rings?”
    </p>
<p>
     The left hand that usually adorned an engagement ring and wedding band was now devoid of both.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked down at her hand and blinked. “Oh, um-” She faltered in her speech, obviously trying to come up with an explanation for Agatha. “I…” Still thinking of an excuse. “Well, it was so cold out tonight that my rings kept sliding so I just stuck them both in my bag.”
    </p>
<p>
     Liar.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, smart.” Agatha conceded as she heard Wanda begin speaking about date ideas again.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Walking into oncoming traffic would actually solve a lot of my problems.’ Rio thought as she walked into the practice on Tuesday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     After Friday, Rio had spent the weekend in a hotbed of self loathing and masturbation. She cycled between the two. One minute she’d think about how she was now the other woman, the mistress. The next, she’d get off to what she could’ve done had Agatha stayed in that bathroom a little longer. But no, Agatha bolted because of course she fucking did. And telling Alice and Jen that she ‘didn’t want to make Rio uncomfortable’? That hot, manipulative, evil, little munch.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t heard from Agatha in the days following their…dalliance. But Rio knew better than to relax, the professor was just waiting for the right moment to strike. She might be insane, but Agatha was also calculated with her actions.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio focused on her work as much as she could in the two hours leading up to the dreaded session. Her stomach was in knots about facing the married woman who had railed her in a club bathroom, and that married woman’s wife.
    </p>
<p>
     The worst part? Rio wanted it to happen again. It was like a drug and Rio was suffering from withdrawal. She wanted to touch Agatha, be touched by Agatha, let the other woman break her. She was looking at her computer and not taking in any of the info on the screen, additionally, she was chewing on her pen in such a vicious manner that she could hear the plastic crunch between her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Careful, don’t want something exploding in your mouth.” Came from the doorway across Rio’s office, tone dripping in seduction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved her eyes past the computer screen to see Agatha sauntering in five minutes early, sans Wanda. Why the fuck did these women never arrive together?? She quickly removed the pen from her mouth, dropping it onto the desk before exhaling a deep breath. This was gonna be a nightmare.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s the matter, Doc? You seem…stiff,” The older woman approached Rio’s desk, placing her palms flat on the surface and leaning in. “Stressed, almost.” Her eyes twinkled with mayhem, “I could help you with that, I know a few tricks.” She concluded with a grin before fucking winking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s your wife, Agatha?” Rio bit out, hoping the cold tone would discourage her. It didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “She meets with a personal trainer every Tuesday and Friday morning.” Agatha replied, still looming over Rio’s desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “So naturally, you also scheduled therapy on those days?”
    </p>
<p>
     “These are the only days in the week I have a break in my schedule. Oh- I’m sorry, HAD a break in my schedule. Now, I’m stuck in therapy with my very fleeting free time.”  She rounded Rio’s desk and pulled the swivel chair to swing towards her, bending down to come face to face with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The door, thank God, was closed as she took in the woman who she hadn’t stopped thinking about in a week. Fuck, it had only been a week and Rio was already this wrecked over her? Agatha stood in heels, another white button up, and a black midi skirt. Rio had to hold herself back from falling to her knees and begging to bury herself underneath that skirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached out with one finger and hooked under the collar of Rio's sweater.
     <br/>
     “I like the turtleneck, but I usually enjoy seeing my handiwork.” Her breath cradled Rio’s ear as she teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, the turtleneck felt too thick, too hot, just too much in proximity to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- uh,” Rio tried to form a thought, any thought, but it was futile when Agatha was looking at her like she was gonna fucking tear her apart. “This is inappropriate.” Yeah and the sky is blue, fucking duh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed and pulled back slightly to look Rio in the eye. “Oh, is this inappropriate? Right now?” One hand dropped to Rio’s upper thigh, gently massaging. “What do you suggest we do about it? Cause, I have so many ideas.”
    </p>
<p>
     She was going to combust and the session hadn’t even begun. “Please, just please, sit down and wait for the session to start.” Rio said it through clenched teeth, her resolution cracking. She was too turned on for it being ten in the morning. Wanda would be here soon, and everything would be fine because Agatha would have to behave herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, since you begged..” Agatha smiled, but relented, exiting Rio’s personal space and moving to the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood, collected her notepad and gnawed-through pen, and made her way to the chair sat opposite from the sofa.  She needed to set a boundary, tell Agatha they couldn’t do this, that the guilt was eating Rio up inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha-”
    </p>
<p>
     Then the door swung open, producing the redhead that Rio was starting to find herself jealous of. She had Agatha, got to hold her, talk openly with her, kiss her at will. And instead she just ignored her? Was bored of her? She didn’t know what she had.
    </p>
<p>
     No, that's not fair. As far as Rio knows, Wanda was innocent. It was the doctor and professor that were inflicting pain upon Wanda, ruining her life, lying to her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio needed to stop spiraling if she was going to get through this appointment.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sat in the same spot she always did and greeted her wife and therapist before Rio opened her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we begin?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t wait, Doc.” Agatha answered with a shit-eating grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to throttle her.

     Chapter 6
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The first ten minutes of the session Rio spent asking about the homework from their last appointment. She learned that they had, in fact, gone out together Saturday night. Upon hearing that Rio tucked her tongue in her cheek and steeled her jaw, Agatha went on a date with her wife not even a full twenty-four hours after fucking Rio. Did it go well? Did they reconnect and find the spark to save their marriage? Did they go home and fuck like bunnies afterwards?
    </p>
<p>
     ‘You’re gonna give yourself a migraine’ She reminded herself, and she was right. She was a professional, she could separate her feelings about Agatha from her feelings about Agatha and Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “We hadn’t been in ages, so it was great that we decided to go again.” Wanda concluded about which cozy, yet undoubtedly chic restaurant the wives dined at over the weekend.
    </p>
<p>
     “And how did the conversation flow? Were you two able to abide by the ‘no kids, no blame’ rule?” Rio asked, silently praying she didn’t sound like a jealous girlfriend as she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what? We actually did!” Wanda looked so proud of herself. “My friend Monica, who I used to work with at a gallery downtown is trying to get me to come back, so we talked a lot about that. We also talked about Agatha’s job and how she thinks every student is inept these days.” Wanda said while flourishing her hand towards Agatha, knowing she had provoked her wife to vent.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think, I know. You try explaining the difference between ‘your’ and ‘you’re’ to a class of graduate students and you’ll see my point! They’re all fucking illiterate, this generation.” Agatha rambled, looking at Wanda who was now giggling at Agatha’s theatrics.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, Rio could not separate her feelings. Not while watching this scene unfold. The two women on the couch were laughing. Together. They were making each other laugh and actually talking to one another.
    </p>
<p>
     “I'm pretty sure the ones who are illiterate are still in high school, darling.” Wanda mock comforted through her chuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     Darling?
    </p>
<p>
     “Wonderful, so I have another one to four years of mediocrity before society completely devolves.” Agatha snorted. “That makes me feel so much better, hon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hon?
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, had Rio saved their marriage in one week by just making them have dinner and talk? Apparently, that wasn’t out of the realm of possibility considering Rio had never heard a pet name swapped amongst the women, and now they were basically about to fuck each other's brains out right on Rio’s couch. She could feel herself getting enraged.
    </p>
<p>
     She had her pen in a deathgrip in her fist while her thumb pushed down against the side of it. She needed an outlet for the very real, very homicidal feelings she was feeling at this current moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s great to hear.” Oh, she knew how fake her voice sounded, but at least it was professional. “How did it feel? To be able to talk to one another openly? Without fear of negative repercussions?”
    </p>
<p>
     Say bad. Please say bad. Say it was horrible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” Agatha replied. “Better.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess we had gotten so caught up in the IVF and pointing fingers, that I had forgotten how nice it was to just talk about the everyday little things with her.” Wanda elaborated while smiling a real smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t own a gun, but she did have a wall of daggers. Sharp ones.
    </p>
<p>
     “WE?” Agatha snapped her head to her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s placing blame.” Wanda pointed a finger across the couch towards Agatha and looked at Rio like she was the teacher’s pet and got a question right.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re literally pointing fingers right now.” Agatha’s eyebrows shot up as she stated the obvious, still smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about intimacy?” Rio all but fucking blurted. Smooth.
     <br/>
     Agatha and Wanda both immediately went ridged.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, something to stop all the camaraderie, remind them just how miserable they are.
    </p>
<p>
     Wow, therapist of the year.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pardon?” Wanda said after awkwardly clearing her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flipped back to her notes from last week and began explaining. “In your first session, Agatha claimed that you two don’t touch.” Rio looked up briefly to see Wanda’s face drained of any genuine emotion, and Agatha almost smirking. Freak.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you asking, Doc?” Agatha questioned, leaning in like she was finally engaging, like her ears were now perked up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think the date rekindled any physical intimacy? Foster an environment where touch feels normal again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Even Rio couldn’t believe she had the audacity to ask that. But she was dying to know. Was Agatha just fooling around with Rio for fun? To get off on some very disturbing fantasy? Did Agatha fuck her wife the way she had fucked Rio? Did she make Wanda beg? Or was that reserved just for Rio because she wasn’t as pure and innocent as Wanda in Agatha’s eyes? Was she rough with Rio because she had to be gentle with her precious wife? Jesus Christ, did Agatha have a Madonna-whore complex? Honestly a little impressive considering most people who suffered with that were straight men.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘You’re still in session with these people FYI’ Rio remembered.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, that’s right. The pen was still in Rio’s hand, starting to bend from all the force pressing against it.
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” Agatha said simply. No explanation or context.
    </p>
<p>
     “We held hands on the way back to the car,” Wanda corrected her wife. “I can’t remember the last time we participated in any sort of PDA, so that’s progress, I guess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond as she felt something wet against her stomach, she looked down and- Great. The pen she abused had finally snapped in two, covering Rio’s abdomen in red ink.
    </p>
<p>
     She probably looked like a gunshot victim with the scarlet liquid splayed against her cream colored sweater. It was all over her hands, she stiffened her posture and held her drenched palms in front of her. “Shit.” She let out under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh no,” Wanda said standing up. “Let me find you a washcloth and some club soda, I have stain remover in my purse. I’ll be right back.” And just like that, the redhead was out of the office, closing the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well at least it didn’t explode in your mouth.” Agatha said in that fucking smart-ass tone. She had made no move to get up and help Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am two seconds away from murdering you, like, a thousand times.” Rio snapped back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think you’re allowed to say that to me.” The older woman pursed her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah well, never stopped me before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you jealous?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scoffed and feigned indifference. “Of course not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, very.
    </p>
<p>
     That’s when Agatha stood up, picked up the box of tissues Rio had on the coffee table and approached her. She pulled a few tissues out and cradled one of Rio’s hands as she worked at soaking up the ink pooling in Rio’s palm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Never would’ve pegged you for the possessive type.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not.” Rio argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really? Your hands look like Hannibal Lecter’s because you had a temper tantrum, and you’re still going to lie?” Agatha now moved onto Rio’s other hand with a fresh set of tissues.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda returned and out of instinct, Rio tried to jolt her hand back, but Agatha’s hold remained steady. She looked at Rio as if to say ‘me cleaning your hand is not incriminating, calm down’. Still, touching Agatha, even in a platonic way, felt wrong in front of Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, got it.” Wanda stated, holding up the washcloth and club soda she found, presumably in the staff break room.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finished cleaning Rio’s hand and discarded the tissues, letting Rio finally stand up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aggie, could you run to my car and grab something for Dr. Vidal to wear? I just picked up our dry cleaning, there’s got to be something that’ll fit.” Wanda asked as she placed the washcloth to Rio’s sweater, making the red patch lighter with every swipe. Agatha left the room with an affirmative nod of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, you really don’t have to do that.” Rio said in a voice that made her feel small. She was wrecking the home of the woman who was trying to mend her sweater.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nonsense.” She was methodically patting the stain before she grabbed the tide stick and ran it over the worst parts of the crime scene.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry.” Rio uttered quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stopped her ministrations, and looked up from where she was working to Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “What for?” Wanda asked, scrunching her eyebrows together and looking confused.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘For sleeping with your wife, for letting her distract me from my job, for being a piss-poor excuse of a human.’
    </p>
<p>
     “For eating away at your session, this is supposed to be time for you and Agatha to improve your marriage. Now it’s about me and my inability to win a fight against a pen.” Rio self- deprecated.
    </p>
<p>
     She expected a polite laugh or smile from the woman, instead Wanda’s expression was blank.
    </p>
<p>
     “We could have all the time in the world, Dr. Vidal,” Wanda dropped her eyes back down to the sweater, raising the washcloth to it again. “And it still wouldn’t save my marriage.”
    </p>
<p>
     So Wanda was also aware that her and Agatha were doomed, fan-fucking-tastic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you say that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Listen, I’m sure you’re great at your job. I’m sure you’ve rehabilitated thousands of broken marriages, but…” Wanda stopped and looked up at the ceiling, like she was stopping tears from welling over. “Even you have to see the writing on the wall.” She let out a watery laugh and looked at the doctor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to keep questioning, wanted to know what Wanda knew, if she was hiding something. Maybe these women really were made for one another since they both spoke in the most cryptic way imaginable. She felt like she was meant to be solving a riddle every time one of them opened their mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so, options were limited at the Maximoff-Harkness garage sample-sale.” Agatha announced as she dramatically re-entered the room with a hanger in hand. “But, I think this’ll get you through the rest of your day.” Passing over the piece of black fabric to Rio with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, thank you. I’ll just- I’ll be right back.” Rio awkwardly excused herself from her office, making her way to the restroom down the hall. Rio made quick work of washing her hands, and taking off her turtleneck before grabbing the article of clothing loaned to her. She briefly wondered which woman the shirt belonged to. It was a black satin blouse with lace detailing and a ‘V’ neckline.
    </p>
<p>
     That fucking bitch.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked a shirt that made it impossible for Rio to hide the mouth-shaped bruises on her neck from Friday. They had faded some, but not enough to be wearing something like this.
    </p>
<p>
     Was she trying to get caught? Did she want Wanda to smack Rio across her face? Why did she do any of this? And why, why, why did it make Agatha even more attractive? Up until now, Rio had dated nice, normal women. Her forty- year track record tarnished at the hands of Agatha Harkness, who was not nice or normal.
    </p>
<p>
     She begrudgingly put on the blouse and pushed as much of her hair forward as she could. The ‘V’ of the blouse wasn’t that deep and stopped before Rio’s sternum, but did nothing to cover the reminders of Agatha littered along her throat. She fiddled with her hair one more time and collected her now ruined sweater and started walking back the way she came.
    </p>
<p>
     She let out a calming breath as she pushed the door to her office open and was greeted with Agatha and Wanda sitting on the couch. She checked the clock on her wall as she walked over to her desk and flung the sweater in the bottom drawer. She then turned her body to face the couple.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know we have ten minutes left, but in light of recent events, I’m saying we call it early. Yeah? We can pick this up again on Friday.” Rio tried sounding cheery as she spoke but she was hanging onto her sanity by a thread right now.  “Thank you both for lending me the shirt, I’ll be sure to get it back to you when we meet again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No worries, I’m glad we were able to find you something. It looks good on you.” Wanda said as she stood and collected her bag and jacket.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha mirrored the same movements as her wife. “Yeah I have half a mind to tell you to keep it. Looks better on you than it does on me.” Her voice was casual, probably because Wanda was in the room. But the compliment and the confirmation that Rio was wearing Agatha’s clothing did not go unnoticed.
    </p>
<p>
     Both women shuffled out of Rio’s office and closed the door behind them. She felt like she could breathe again, the only problem was every time she did so, she was struck with Agatha’s scent. Freshly laundered or not, Rio was drowning in it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let the silence wash over her for a minute or two before slumping in defeat.
    </p>
<p>
     As she leaned against her desk, she looked up to find a bag left on the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     Not even a full minute later did Agatha walk back in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Forgot my purse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Bald-faced fucking lie.
     <br/>
     But she didn’t make a move towards the coffee table, she didn't break her stride until she was in front of Rio. She reached out, grabbed Rio’s face with both hands and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reacted before her brain could process what was happening, she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, pulling her in tighter. Angling her head to kiss Agatha deeper, she needed more.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman pulled away, ignoring Rio’s whine at the action, and whispered against Rio’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve gotta go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stay.” Rio pleaded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s the fun in that?” Agatha beamed, and Rio pouted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, you love it. “ Her thumb grazed Rio’s bottom lip as she continued.
     <br/>
     “The anticipation.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s legs almost gave out.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned, picked up her bag, and left Rio’s office without another word.

     Chapter 7
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat at her desk in her office on campus swimming in approximately one million different documents. Lesson plans, lectures, staff emails, student work, all vying for her attention. It was late on Wednesday night, around 7pm when she heard the music in the hallway increase in volume as someone approached her office door.
    </p>
<p>
     “TEEN.” She screeched from her desk.
    </p>
<p>
     The little emo twenty-five year TA Agatha had popped his head in almost instantaneously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you, I will only put up with your lackluster excuse for music if you listen to it QUIETLY.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Put up with? It’s Chappell. You should love her.” He spoke cluelessly as to why she might be irritated in the present moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t just listen to someone because they’re gay, Teen. Unlike you, I have standards.”
    </p>
<p>
     “William.” He corrected, but it was futile, to Agatha he might as well have been a fetus. The nickname was etched in stone in her brain. “Or Billy, I’ll answer to either.”  As if he didn’t already answer to the pet name.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just keep it down, nobody needs to hear a song about jacking off floating through the very expensive corridors of a private university.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you do listen to the lyrics!” He said it like it was a gotcha moment, which Agatha would never let him revel in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Grade the rest of the mid-term papers, I need to go home and specifically, I need to get away from you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, but I was just going to grab you, there’s a woman here asking where your office is.”
    </p>
<p>
     A woman?
    </p>
<p>
     “What’d she look like?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Brown hair, brown eyes, kinda resembles a Tim Burton character.” He shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Send her in.” Agatha said, careful not to move her face in any way that would give the boy any indication as to what Rio was to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Various seconds later, Teen returned with Rio in tow. She looked ridiculously hot in brown trousers, a white t-shirt, and a gingham blazer. God bless this woman’s work attire, truly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you Hark’s wife?” He asked as he ushered her in. Fuck, this kid had no sense of decorum.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, no-” Rio began.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because she keeps you a well kept secret, seriously, the only reason we know she’s married is because of her ring. Otherwise, it’s radio silence. You should demand a ring upgrade as punishment.  I didn’t even know she was gay until-”
    </p>
<p>
     “THANK YOU, TEEN, YOU MAY GO.” Agatha barked out as the boy turned to exit the room with his tail tucked between his legs. At least he had the decency to close the door behind him.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her attention to Rio standing in front of her desk. “How’d you-” Agatha started questioning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen told Alice at the bar that you two work together. Doesn’t take a genius to google ‘Columbia English department’ and find the building.”
    </p>
<p>
     Bold move.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well then, stalker, to what do I owe this pleasure?” She quipped back, placing her elbows on her desk and leaning forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “I actually didn’t think you’d be here so late, I just wanted to leave you this.” Rio responded and almost sounded nervous. She had her hand tucked behind her back before revealing what she was hiding. In her hand she grasped a small, obviously handmade bouquet of flowers, she extended her arm across the desk towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “M’lady.” She dramatically proclaimed as Agatha took the bouquet with confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     What the fuck?
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that I’m not flattered, but last time I checked, you were still acting pretty…” What was the right word? Batshit fucking crazy? “Melodramatic over our last…encounter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and looked down at her hands. “I guess, I missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t make it a thing, I’m already going against all my morals here. I don’t need you rubbing it in.” Rio looked back up at Agatha at her desk, she was blushing. “Plus, I meant to leave them at your door, I wasn’t planning on giving them to you directly.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what would people think? A married woman receiving flowers from a secret admirer?” Agatha gasped in fake horror, clutching her imaginary pearls.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe that your wife got them for you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pfft, I don’t think Wanda’s gotten me flowers in-”  Had Wanda ever given her flowers? Just cause? “Well, ever.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a shame. You deserve nice things, Agatha.” Rio’s voice was soft, genuine.
    </p>
<p>
     That hit her right in her stupid fucking heart. Rio made her feel seen in ways she had all but forgotten about. This woman had known her just shy of two weeks, and she took the time to craft a bouquet for her? With Wanda, Agatha was always the one bending, going out of her way, taking care of everything. She was the sole income earner, she was the provider. And here stood someone who wanted to take care of Agatha just because she felt like it, even if only in a small way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found a decorative Columbia mug that she kept on her bookshelf behind her desk, and placed the flowers in it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love them, thank you. They’re gonna die so fast.” Agatha smiled as she warned Rio that she had not a single inkling of a green thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome.” Rio grinned back. “I should go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t.” Agatha didn’t want this to be over yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha-” Rio already sounded so defeated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come here.” Agatha pleaded and rolled her chair back from her desk. Agatha didn’t normally plead, but Rio made it easy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked slightly conflicted but made her way around the desk to stand in front of a still sitting Agatha. She looked down so brown met blue and let out a breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you own pants so why do you never wear them?” Rio playfully asked as her gaze dropped down Agatha’s form.
    </p>
<p>
     She was in a navy dress, one that took in her waist. She knew she looked good but Rio made her feel like a goddess with the way she stared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “How else would I torture you, Doc?” Agatha tempted. She reached out and pulled Rio by her wrist, forcing her closer and ultimately into Agatha’s lap, making the younger woman straddle her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands rested on Rio’s thighs while she felt fingers bury themselves in her hair. “I missed you too.” Agatha whispered honestly as she looked up at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio curled her fingers in Agatha’s hair and pulled her towards her lips, crashing into one another. The kiss was desperate, like Rio was going to waste away if she didn’t get her mouth on Agatha’s. She thrust herself further into Agatha’s grip, letting out a small sound as Agatha brushed her tongue against Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ran her hands from Rio’s thighs to her waist, pulling her in as if they weren’t already pressed as close as possible. She ached for this woman, she couldn’t get enough, she’d never get enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, can I touch you?” Rio breathed out before diving back in to kiss Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, Agatha wasn’t expecting that. Logically, she knew it was probably coming since Rio hadn’t gotten to have Agatha the last time they did this. It’s not that Agatha wasn’t interested in receiving, she was sure she’d pass out at the sight of Rio on her knees. But, it made her feel strangely vulnerable to let Rio have that kind of access to her. Nobody had that kind of access for three years. So, she did what she was good at. She pulled back from the kiss and she deflected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you think about it? Fucking me?” Agatha asked low in Rio’s ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio groaned out, grinding her hips down, obviously trying to find friction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you fuck yourself thinking about it? About me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio practically fucking whined. She was so responsive, so eager.
    </p>
<p>
     “Show me.” Agatha motioned her head towards the desk behind Rio, silently directing her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back to look Agatha in the eyes, like she was making sure Agatha wasn’t fucking with her. “You’re serious?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Deadly.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was enough confirmation for Rio who then stood, removed her blazer and sat on Agatha’s desk, her hands placed behind her for stability.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat forward to unbutton and peel off Rio’s pants, placing a searing kiss against her hipbone as she discarded the fabric onto the floor. Rio sat in front of her in a fitted white t-shirt and lacy green underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew she was going to hell but right now, looking at Rio, she felt like God’s favorite.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand started slipping beneath the waistband of her underwear, and that just wouldn’t do. Agatha reached out and grabbed Rio’s hand, stopping the movement.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said,” Agatha lowered her tone. “Show. Me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes fluttered for a second, taking in the command.
    </p>
<p>
     She wordlessly hooked her thumbs into the waistband, lifted her hips, and let the lace fall down her legs. She kept eye-contact as she did so, but Agatha’s eyes fell to her cunt.
    </p>
<p>
     God, she was dripping, Agatha wanted to suffocate between Rio’s thighs at this moment, forget the power grab.
    </p>
<p>
     No. Not yet. Practice some self-restraint.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat back in her chair like she was getting ready to watch a show, and in a way, she was. “Go ahead.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped her hand back down, running two fingers through herself before moving back up to circle her clit. Her back arched as the hand not touching herself came around to grip the edge of the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Rio moaned, dropping her head back.
    </p>
<p>
     Too loud, Teen was still here even if nobody else was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sprung out of her chair, grabbed Rio’s jaw and pulled her close. “I need you to be quiet for me, can you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s fingers sped up and she nodded, eyes glazed over.
    </p>
<p>
     “Use your words, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can be quiet.” Rio huffed, chest heaving, sweat forming at her temples.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good girl.” Agatha praised and let her hand drop to Rio’s throat, resting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio covered Agatha’s free hand with her own and moved it upwards, telling Agatha to squeeze. So she did, not enough to block airflow, but just enough to make Rio’s eyes widen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, please.” Rio whimpered out through the professor’s stronghold on her neck, her hand struggling to keep moving.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you need help?” Agatha mocked condescendingly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rapidly nodded her head as much as she could with her limited mobility. Agatha kept one hand on her neck and swatted Rio’s hand away with her other. Rio brought her now free hand to Agatha’s ass, groping shamelessly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let her fingers collect the slick now pooling at Rio’s center. “You’re soaked. This all for me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “All for you. Only you, Ag-” Rio was cut off as two fingers sunk into her, moaning again.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet again, too fucking loud.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled Rio in by her throat and silenced her with a devastating kiss. Pumping her fingers and curling before slipping her tongue into the other woman’s mouth. She wanted to devour her so completely that she was ruined for anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Agatha had a possessive streak too.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled back from the kiss and moved her hand up to Rio’s mouth as she added a third finger. Rio’s near-scream was muffled against her palm but it would’ve been so much more satisfying if she could’ve heard it. Fucking hell, next time they really needed a bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s forehead was now glistening with a sheen of sweat, her makeup was running slightly from the tears welling up in her eyes, her gaze was glassy. Agatha could feel her walls pulsing around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You feel so good.” Agatha said breathlessly. Rio could only respond with the most pathetic little sound.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved her thumb to Rio’s clit, matching the rhythm of her fingers. Rio’s hips jerked, her legs wrapped around Agatha’s waist, she was trembling. Both of Rio’s hands flew to Agatha’s shoulders, clawing angry red marks into the skin. She didn’t want to think about how she’d explain that to Wanda later, if Wanda even noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re doing so well, baby.” Agatha said it with so much genuine affection, she almost didn’t believe it left her mouth. Rio was now bearing down on her fingers, bucking wildly against Agatha’s thumb. “Come for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s thighs clamped around Agatha’s waist so tight, it nearly knocked the wind out of her. Rio’s nails dragged down Agatha’s biceps as she came.  Her eyes rolled back and she groaned for one final time against Agatha’s palm before relaxing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s body slumped in the aftershock, her legs and arms dropped from Agatha back onto the desk, and her eyes opened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved her hand back from Rio’s face and slipped her fingers out of her as gently as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Rio whined at the loss.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So okay.” Rio reassured, looking dazed, panting as though she had just run a marathon.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good.” Agatha responded, pushing the digits that were just inside Rio into the younger woman’s mouth. She watched as Rio happily sucked them clean, hollowing her cheeks and moaning.
    </p>
<p>
     Quietly this time, thank god.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha might’ve screwed herself here. Realizing now, in the aftermath, how her own underwear was sticking to her. She was painfully aroused from fucking Rio, from fucking the woman still obediently sucking her fingers and looking like she wanted nothing more than to please Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please let me touch you. Please.” Rio whispered when Agatha pulled her fingers free.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, so she hadn’t even been successful in her goal of distracting Rio. Spectacular.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked at the ground, picked up Rio’s underwear and helped Rio get them back on before repeating the same motions with her pants. Big brown eyes just stared at her in confusion and maybe a little disappointment as Agatha finished dressing her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flopped back into her chair and took in the doctor still sitting atop her desk.
     <br/>
     Vulnerability be damned.
    </p>
<p>
     “I figured you’d want to be clothed again before your knees hit the hardwood.” Agatha grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked like a child who had just won a trip to Disney as the words registered. She dropped to the ground in the blink of an eye and started shucking Agatha’s dress up her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Yeah, Agatha might pass out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled the sodden purple underwear down Agatha’s legs and pocketed them, the sick fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you’re so fucking perfect.” Rio beamed as she kissed and bit the expanse of pale skin she now had access to. Her voice was still gravely.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.” Agatha hated how weak it sounded, how obviously she wanted this. The compliment made her feel too much, like her crush had just said something sweet. She threaded her hands into Rio’s hair and yanked her forward to where she needed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, of course, seemed to like it. She instantly flattened her tongue and licked across Agatha’s cunt before sucking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shiiit.” Agatha wasn’t going to last long at all, and Rio was going to take that as a compliment. God fucking damnit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hold on Agatha’s thighs was going to bruise, she already knew. Different problem for later, but Jesus, Rio was like a woman starved.
    </p>
<p>
     She slung one of the older woman’s legs over her shoulder, changing her angle so she could thrust her tongue inside of Agatha. Grinding her nose against Agatha’s clit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Rio.” She felt herself getting close, grabbing the hair in her hands so tight it might rip from Rio’s scalp. It had to hurt, but Rio didn’t seem to notice as her tongue moved faster.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, Rio, Ri-” Agatha cut herself off as she came, clamping her teeth down against her own bottom lip to keep quiet. She almost fell out of the chair as her body convulsed with pleasure. Rio didn’t care, just kept licking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, baby- I, I can’t.” She barely got the words out, her lungs felt like stone against her ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     She finally pulled away from Agatha’s cunt and,  good god, she was wearing the wetness coating her face like it was a fucking gold medal.
    </p>
<p>
     She placed Agatha’s leg back down and stretched upwards to kiss her. It wasn’t messy or urgent, though. It was soft, it was tender.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh no, Agatha liked her so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I-” She wanted to say something to comfort her, to make sure Rio knew this wasn’t just a fling for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Then the sound of a lesbian drag queen approached closer to her office again and she scrambled. Pulling Rio up and shoving her dress back down. She grabbed Rio’s blazer and threw it at the woman before standing and fixing her hair. Rio seemed to get the message, wiping her face and fixing her jacket so it wasn’t askew.
    </p>
<p>
     The doorknob turned and Teen stood at the doorway, laptop in hand, looking at the screen. “Hey Hark, I have a question about this term paper. Pretty sure it's all ChatGPT.” He said, chuckling.
    </p>
<p>
     What she wouldn’t give to wring his neck at this very moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I should get going.” Rio stated without looking back at Agatha and storming out. She shoved past Billy and disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just stood there dumbfounded by what had just happened in the past, what, twenty minutes? Thirty? She checked her watch.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been an hour.
    </p>
<p>
     “So the essay?” Teen held up the computer.
    </p>
<p>
     ”Uh, yeah. Let me see.” She sat back down and took the laptop with her left hand.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down at the wedding ring she was still wearing and wondered,
    </p>
<p>
     How much does a divorce lawyer cost?

<p>
     Chapter 8
    </p>
<p>
     She was the most pathetic person alive.
    </p>
<p>
     She had to be.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d looked up Agatha’s job, went there, brought her flowers that she had grown herself wrapped up in twine she had picked out specifically because she thought Agatha would like it.
    </p>
<p>
     She then immediately folded and slept with Agatha again. Oh, sorry, no. ‘Slept’ implies there was a bed, or actual sleeping, or some sort of time spent holding each other afterwards. ‘Slept’ implies a certain amount of care, a certain amount of respect, and judging by the way things ended on Wednesday night, Agatha was lacking on both of those accounts.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had covered up her tracks so fast as that TA approached the office. So prepared to keep Rio her dirty little secret, because that’s all Rio is. She had to get that through her brain, that she was nothing to Agatha. Not really. Rio went home to her apartment after she had fled from the scene of the crime, Agatha probably went home to her nice house in the suburbs with her even nicer wife. Agatha probably smiled and ate dinner with Wanda like Rio hadn’t just been begging to give her head an hour prior.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the other part of it too. If it was just normal, run-of-the-mill, average sex, it’d make things so much easier. For one, Rio could find that anywhere and break things off with Agatha. And two, she could finally look at herself in the mirror again without shame. But no, the sex was hot. So hot, that Rio found herself begging that night to do something, anything to Agatha. In hindsight, Rio wanted to die of embarrassment, who the fuck does that with an emotionally-unavaible married woman at her place of work?
    </p>
<p>
     Well, Rio fucking Vidal, of course.
    </p>
<p>
     Professionally speaking, there are psychological reasons why spouses cheat. In Rio’s line of work, she’d been privy to most of those reasons. She wracked her brain trying to pinpoint which one applied to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Reason one: Money.
     <br/>
     A husband makes a bad investment, because it’s always the fucking man, and doesn’t tell his wife. Slowly the bills pile up, he starts feeling like a bad provider in his own home, so he seeks validation elsewhere. A classic cautionary tale of why men should never be left in charge of anything, truly. But it didn’t apply to Agatha, there'd be signs if money was the driving factor. They definitely wouldn’t have booked with her if money were an issue, Rio’s rates were not cheap and she knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     Reason Two: Lack of sexual fulfillment.
     <br/>
     The sex goes out of the relationship, somebody gets bored or depressed enough to find another person outside of their marriage. And while yes, this was definitely part of it for Agatha seeing as she had come around Rio’s tongue in about two minutes flat, it still couldn’t be the sole reason for her infidelity. Using that logic, Agatha could’ve been fucking every grad student that so much as blinked in her direction and something told Rio that Agatha wasn’t doing that. Call it a gut feeling, but Rio was pretty sure that Agatha was only fucking her, and her alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Wow, and they say romance is dead.
    </p>
<p>
     Reason Three: Low self-esteem.
     <br/>
     Not to be a bitch, but this one probably applied. Between the very scarce information Rio had about Agatha’s childhood, and how Agatha was always in control, always making a play for power, it was likely Agatha was insecure. Now, insecure about what? Rio had yet to find out. Still, a possible contributor, but not the cause.
    </p>
<p>
     Reason Four: Kids.
     <br/>
     Yeah babies were adorable, but they were also massive cock-blocks. After popping out a few of them, couples would fall into parent mode 24/7. Not conducive to a healthy relationship or sex life. Additionally, the process of trying to conceive, of trying to get pregnant, could also contribute. The IVF clearly drove a wedge between Agatha and Wanda, but it wasn’t Agatha who was frustrated with their lack of kids. What Agatha was frustrated by was her wife prioritizing children over their marriage. Which brings Rio to the last reason.
    </p>
<p>
     Reason Five: Falling out of love.
     <br/>
     One or both spouses are so checked out of their marriage that they’ve forgotten why they loved each other in the first place. They're no longer connected. Not emotionally. Not mentally. Not physically. This reason was the hardest to counsel couples through because trying to fall back in love with someone took time, it took effort, it took the patience of a fucking saint. That, combined with cheating? Yeah, few came back from that. However, in happier news- ‘Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner, folks!’ Agatha was cheating because she no longer loved Wanda, at least not like she used to. Which, yes, fucking duh. Rio clocked that on day one, but why did Agatha start cheating now?
     <br/>
     Was Rio just that irresistible?
    </p>
<p>
     Or was Agatha finally just that bored?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped her head down onto her desk and groaned, she’d been thinking in circles non-stop since Wednesday. She was going to drive herself to insanity, somebody should have her committed. At least then she’d have to stay away from Agatha, since growing a spine hasn’t been panning out too well for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “UGHHHH.” Rio let out as she repetitively hit her head against her arms folded on the desk. Closest she could get to knocking herself out before Wanda and Agatha got here.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you doing that?” A voice jolted Rio into sitting upright. Lilia was standing there, concern and judgement etched on her face. Next time, Rio needed to close her office door before melting down.
    </p>
<p>
     “The sapphics from hell should be here soon and I’d rather be taken by Death herself than talk to them.” Rio pouted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, what is going on? I have never seen a couple torment you like this in all the years you’ve worked here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So?”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shot her eyebrows up and gave Rio that mom glare. Lilia didn’t have kids of her own, but treated Rio and Alice like family. Regardless, the woman had the mom-guilt gene in spades, apparently.  “So. Explain. Why are you wallowing?”
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t tell Lilia the truth, no matter how much Rio loved her, Lilia was still her boss. If Lilia knew, Rio would be fired and her license would be suspended before the door hit her ass on the way out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because for the first time in my career, I know I can’t save these folks. I’ve had couples throw in the towel before, but I always had faith that they’d make it first.” Rio answered honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     “But not this couple?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “They’re too far gone.”
     <br/>
     Lilia reached across the desk and gently rubbed her thumb against Rio’s forearm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t beat yourself up about it too much. It’s not your fault.” Lilia soothed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio might not be the cause, but she’s sure as hell a catalyst.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, Lilia.” Rio pushed out instead of the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t mention it.” She smiled back at Rio. She opened her mouth to speak again before knitting her eyebrows at the sounds of arguing coming from down the hallway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, I told you, I’m not doing this with you right now.” Agatha’s voice carried.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re about to be in therapy for an hour, when the fuck do you plan on doing it then?” Wanda spat back, it was the most unpleasant Rio had ever heard the redhead be.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go, Lilia. Run. Save yourself.” Rio dramatically declared as she heard the voices getting closer to her office.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia had booked it out of Rio’s office seconds before Agatha and Wanda barreled in, of course they arrived together today. Wanda, despite her tone earlier in the hallway, still looked picturesque. A delicate red top with flowers embroidered, effortlessly sophisticated jeans, not an eyelash out of place, hair perfectly curled. Externally Wanda looked poised as she took her seat. However, Rio could see just below the surface, Wanda was cracking, struggling to maintain an image of composure.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was wearing a dark blue pinstripe suit with a button up under it. Her hair was as wild as ever, and her chest was heaving as she sat down, like she was trying to calm herself down. Good fucking god, Rio’s mouth was watering.
    </p>
<p>
     So not the time to think about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning, guys.” Rio said cautiously as she made herself comfortable in the chair that she always sat in. She picked up the blouse from the last session off the side table and placed it onto the coffee table. “Before I forget..” Rio said, gesturing to the shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Neither of the women were looking at her, neither of them acknowledged anything she had just said.
    </p>
<p>
     So something’s happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there something either of you would like to start with today?” Rio braced herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda whipped her head to stare daggers at her wife, but spoke only to Rio. “I don't know, ask Agatha. She hasn’t been home in two days.”
    </p>
<p>
     Since Wednesday.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     “What, like you’ve missed me?” Agatha gave a cruel smile and looked at Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “You could’ve been dead!” Wanda deflected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, you knew where I was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And where were you, Agatha?” Rio asked, reminding the women that there was another person in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s gaze softened as she met Rio’s eyes, letting out a breath before answering. “We still own a place in the city, I was crashing there.”
    </p>
<p>
     ”Agatha, you’re forty-five, you shouldn’t be ‘crashing’ anywhere. You should drive back home like an adult.” Wanda's voice was strained with frustration.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, I don’t want to be home!” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     This appointment was derailing fast.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Wanda didn't sound confused though, she sounded pissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do I need to be home? So we can exist silently in the same space?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because we’re married and it’s our home?!” Wanda shot up and off the couch now.
    </p>
<p>
     “That home was never ours, Wanda, it’s yours!” Agatha stood up too. “I hate that fucking house.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why’d we buy it then?” Wanda was getting louder, borderline yelling.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Because you fucking wanted it! Because whatever you want, I will break myself to get for you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, so I’m the heinous, frigid wife that just demands and takes. And you’re the victim, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Wanda, that is exactly right. You want and I give.” Agatha was getting louder now too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio should intervene, de-escalate, and implement some breathing exercises to calm them down. But, both women looked so enraged, it scared her a little. They were fighting like it was a war to be won.
    </p>
<p>
     “We bought that house to start a family, I’m sorry that was too big of an ask from my WIFE!” Wanda yelled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Marriage is not blind compliance, Wanda! It’s not making yourself suffer for three fucking years in a fucking Norman Rockwell painting because you snapped after Pietro died!”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh. Oh no. They had very briefly covered the death of Wanda’s twin before, but Rio did not need the full lore to understand Agatha had just fucked up.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked homicidal after hearing those words. “Did my grief over my brother dying inconvenience you?” Wanda asked condescendingly. “When I couldn’t get out of bed for a week, did that annoy you? Are you just so tired of playing the dutiful spouse placating her unstable wife?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Actually, I am! Thank you so much for asking! I am so tired, Wanda. I am so fucking sick of swallowing what I think and how I feel for the sake of you getting to live in an alternate reality.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m living in an alternate reality? You’re never around long enough to know that! You work late so you don’t have to see me, which I know you think I’m too stupid to notice, or you ‘crash’ at the fucking towhouse!” Wanda was screaming now, full on, in the middle of Rio’s office.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, not this again-” Agatha was cut off by her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just ballpark it for me, how many students have you taken back to that townhouse to fuck?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s pulse spiked at the insinuation Agatha was cheating. She was, just not with who Wanda thought, but Rio wasn’t going to correct her.
    </p>
<p>
     “This argument again, thank god, I was beginning to worry you weren’t going to accuse me of things I didn't do!” Agatha sniped back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well you said it yourself, we haven't touched in years, so it’s not crazy to think you’ve been busy elsewhere.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t touched because you were too fucking sore and bruised from the hormones! I couldn’t even grab your waist without you wincing. Eventually, I just gave up.” Agatha was spitting every word.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking crucify me for putting having kids before your libido, Agatha! Please, by all means, fuck whomever you’d like.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Projecting are we, hon?” But the pet name had no affection behind it.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked taken aback for a second before answering. “What are you trying to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not stupid either, Wanda. You’ve been seeing someone behind my back.” Agatha stated it like it was obvious. “And I’ve ignored it because it was easier than telling you that I can’t fix this. I can’t bring Pietro back, I can’t magically save our marriage, and I can’t change the fact that you’re barren!”
    </p>
<p>
     The room froze as Agatha finished yelling.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda set her jaw and looked her wife directly in the eyes. She wiped her cheeks of a few stray tears. Her voice was low, like venom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your mother was right about you.”
     <br/>
     Rio didn’t need to know the context to see Wanda had just shoved a proverbial blade into her wife’s chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is something wrong deep inside you, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s hand on the hilt of the dagger steeled before pushing further.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something evil.”
    </p>
<p>
     And twisting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw Agatha’s face fall in slow motion. The confrontational smirk dropped instantly. Now her lip trembled. Her eyes, which were previously filled with fire, like she was getting ready to burn the world down, were now an endless sea of stormy blue. Tears pooling, threatening to spill. Rio had never seen Agatha look so vulnerable, so small, so distressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had achieved her goal of inflicting the maximum amount of damage she could, but she didn’t look proud. Instead, she looked remorseful, like she had just realized what she said and the impact it had.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aggie-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t!” Agatha spewed out through the now free-flowing tears, grabbing her bag and jacket, obviously getting ready to make a break for it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio stood and tried to soothe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t.” Agatha answered, but this time she said it to Rio. This time, it was softer, it was a plea.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t say anything else as she left the room and slammed the door behind her. Rio waited for Wanda to go after her, to try and apologize again, but she just stood there. Her head was dropped into her hand, thumb and index finger rubbing her temples.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to stay unbiased about the fight. Both Agatha and Wanda had said terrible shit. Had thrown things in each other’s faces that couldn’t be controlled. But only Agatha left crying, which means Wanda just reopened a massive fucking emotional wound that Agatha had probably spent many decades trying to mend or ignore.
    </p>
<p>
     “Professionally speaking, how bad was that?” Wanda asked through her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Absolute dumpster fire.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve seen worse.” Rio lied.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a monster, Dr. Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I never said you were.” Rio kept her tone as neutral as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t have to, your face says it all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio then realized how tense her face was from all the muscles she was contorting at once. Her brows knit together in worry, her mouth frowning, her jaw working itself.
    </p>
<p>
     “My apologies.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just- I lost everything after Pietro. I lost my best friend, I lost my will to live, I lost a part of who I was.” Wanda started explaining, crossing her arms over her chest like she was trying to protect herself from her own words. “I wanted so badly to just feel okay again. I guess, I figured that becoming a mom would heal that.” She blew out a breath and continued. “Pietro would’ve been an amazing uncle, ya know, the type to throw the kids into the pool and bounce them too high on the trampoline.” She smiled. “Then the years go by, and I wake up one day, and Agatha hates me. Now, I've lost my wife too.” Wanda finished with a bitter chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand.” Rio said it as a comfort, but she knew nothing could comfort the woman in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Wanda sniffled, picking up her things and moving towards the door. “Thanks for everything today, Dr.Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     And just like that Rio was alone again.
    </p>
<p>
     What the fuck had just happened? Did Rio just witness the complete breakdown of their marriage? Or is that how they always fight? Was it like a bloodsport for them?
     <br/>
     She looked at the blouse that was still sitting on the coffee table, neither of them had picked it up on their way out.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the fuck just happened in here??” Alice rushed in. “I heard, like, a bunch of screaming. I eavesdropped until I was sure you were alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to look at Alice, a somber expression coating her features. “Yeah, uh, teddy bear and the snake.” She supplied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did they break up?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, I have no fucking clue.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you wanna get drunk about it tonight?” Alice joked, obviously trying to lighten the mood.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s Friday, go spend time with your girlfriend. I’ll be fine.” And Rio would be, after she spent all weekend wallowing some more over what a bad person she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, but seriously, let me know if you need to vent. I’ll show up in ten minutes or less with wine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll keep that in mind.” Rio dismissed and went on with the rest of her day. Fortunately enough for Rio, she didn’t have other patients that day, allowing her to catch up on paperwork. It was 6pm and everyone else had gone home for the day, she was still ignoring the world via patient charts when her phone buzzed.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d already told Alice she was fine several more times that day, but of course Alice had to text and check on her. When she unlocked her phone to reply, it wasn’t Alice. Rio’s eyes widened at the screen, a text bubble displayed two words.
    </p>
<p>
     'Come over?'
    </p>
<p>
     Then a location pin was dropped and shared with Rio before another text came through.
    </p>
<p>
     'Please?'

     Chapter 9
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stood in front of the most likely century old brownstone in Wicker Park, well she didn’t stand so much as she paced. Carefully weighing her options, the repercussions of what she was about to do. Back and forth, back and forth. Agatha was probably emotionally fragile from the fallout with Wanda today, was Rio taking advantage of her vulnerability by being here right now? Does that add another layer to being a terrible person, or would that land in the morally gray area of the scale?
    </p>
<p>
     The front door of the townhouse creaked open, producing a ray of soft light out onto the dark street. Agatha was standing there, her arms wrapped around herself to try and keep warm temporarily while she stood there looking at Rio still pacing.
    </p>
<p>
     “So are you coming in, or are you just going to brood all night and most definitely catch hypothermia?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped in her tracks and looked towards Agatha, she was still in her suit from earlier minus the jacket and a few buttons of her shirt undone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Rio conceded and started making her way up the stone stairs, meeting Agatha on the top step.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” Agatha said with a small smile, her eyes still a little red from crying earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” Rio smiled back. “How are you feeling?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Better now that you’re here.” Agatha sounded genuine, and Rio tried very hard to not let that go to her head.
    </p>
<p>
     They both stood there in the cold staring at one another, something felt different from the other times.
    </p>
<p>
     “So can we go in? I hear there’s heightened chances of hypothermia out here.” Rio quipped. Agatha just chuckled, laced her fingers with Rio’s and led her inside. Has Agatha ever held her hand before? Like, for real? Rio was pretty sure she hadn't.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio entered the house she was surprised by the décor, none of it screamed Wanda. The floorplan had a living room to the left, a kitchen at the end of the hall, and a staircase across from the front of the door. Everything was saturated in deep, rich colors, dark wood accentuated the aesthetic. There was a large eggplant-toned sectional in the living room opposite what Rio was sure was the original fireplace. Bookcases covering the walls, and a massive vinyl collection placed next to a vintage looking media console from what looked to be from the 60s? 70s? The place was like a time capsule. Stevie Nicks’ voice carried through the home as the record spun on the console. The lighting was soft, warm, no overhead lights, just various lamps sprawled throughout.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is not what I thought you and Wanda’s place would look like. I kinda figured it'd be more…” Rio started.
    </p>
<p>
     “Beige and lifeless?” Agatha retorted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just looked at her and nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “That would be the other place, in the suburbs. Wanda and I barely lived here after getting married, so it’s still all me all over the place. Feel free to look around, I gotta check dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re cooking?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I didn’t want to assume, but I hoped you might join me.” Agatha said, but it held none of her normal bravado. Like she was nervous that Rio would reject something so innocent.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- yeah. Yeah, I could eat.” Rio grinned as she accepted the- what was this? A dinner invite? A date?
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I know you can.” Agatha smiled mischievously, referring to their last time together, back in Agatha’s office. She then made her way down the hall to the kitchen where Rio heard clanging of pots and pans.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tucked her tongue against the inside of her cheek and found a coat hook near the door and hung her jacket before slipping off her shoes.
    </p>
<p>
     This was weird. This was really weird, right? Agatha had invited her over out of the blue, after Rio witnessed the knock-down drag-out of her marriage earlier that day. And weirder, Agatha didn’t make an obvious move on her. The only physical contact she’d made thus far was holding Rio’s hand, she seemed bashful about non-sexual touches. What the fuck was happening here? Rio made her way around the living room, touching little knick knacks and seeing what literature Agatha kept. She looked down at the mahogany coffee table and picked up a book she recognized.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re reading Sunburn?” Rio shouted across the space and into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha popped her head in to respond. “Yes, but I’m only halfway through, so no spoilers. I’m serious, I’m very invested in Lucy’s arc.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re going to bawl your eyes out at the end. Lucy-” Rio began.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lalalalalala-” Agatha covered her ears from Rio’s explanation and made her way back to the kitchen. She then heard the woman shout again. “Wine?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was chuckling as she followed Agatha’s voice, taking in the dark green tones of the kitchen cabinets, the black and white honeycomb tile of the floors, and the decades old stove Agatha was cooking on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think it says something that you’re reading a book about a repressed Irish-Catholic fifteen year old girl who’s struggling with being a lesbian? Or just a fun coincidence?” Rio cocked her head to the side as she pointed out the irony.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha began pouring two glasses of wine, one for her, one for Rio. “No, I do not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finished pouring and handed Rio a glass. “Because I’m not Irish.” Agatha wittily responded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…” She chided.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, can you not shrink my head for tonight? I think I’ve had enough therapy for several thousand closet cases. Also, I’m making you dinner, and I’d hate to have to poison it because you made me do too much introspective work.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fair enough. So what are you making?” Rio took a sip of her wine. Damn it was good, probably very expensive.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha unbuttoned the cuffs of her sleeves and started to roll them up her arm and fold them over at her elbow. Why was that attractive? Why was this woman cooking dinner in half a suit making Rio feel something? Agatha began stirring one of the pots as she answered. “Nothing exciting, just pasta with some homemade sauce.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re making me dinner from scratch?” Rio quirked her eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “You sound surprised.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just didn’t know the mistress got a home cooked meal.” It was petty, yes, but Rio wanted to understand what Agatha was doing here.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped stirring and turned to face Rio, her face loomed with regret. “I’m sorry, Rio. I never meant to make you feel-” Agatha stopped. “I’m just sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what is this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “...Dinner?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what I mean. Why’d you ask me to come over? Why are you cooking me dinner and opening fancy wine?” Rio needed some clarity.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, I just like being around you. After today, you’re the one person I wanted to see.” Agatha quietly admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     She had a lot more work to do, but for today, it was enough. For today, it was the most open Agatha had ever been, and Rio wanted to acknowledge that. It was progress, no matter how small.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’ll only accept your apology on one condition.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what’s that?” Agatha looked worried as she awaited Rio’s answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped into Agatha’s space and looped her arms loosely around her waist. “This better be the best, most poison-free pasta I’ve ever had.” Rio exaggerated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m so fucked.” Agatha grinned back, her eyes dopey as she looked at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something tells me you’ll pull through.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted before turning her attention back to the stove. “Go sit at the table, I’ll plate everything and bring it over.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh boy, don’t I feel like a princess.” Rio deadpanned as she picked up both glasses of wine and took her seat in the adjoining dining room. Jesus, how big was this house?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha then sat a plate down in front of Rio before sitting down with her own. She picked up her fork, took a bite, and fuck it was good. Rio absentmindedly let out a groan over the food.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, it’s not that good.” Agatha minimized.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes it is, I’ve never had sauce from scratch like this.” Quickly licking her fork before gathering another bite.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a forty year old woman and you’ve never pureed tomatoes and spice together?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what the glass jars at the grocery store are for.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What about your mom? Not much of a cook?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She was a single parent working nights, if it couldn’t be microwaved in under five minutes, she didn’t make it.” Rio explained without malice. Her mom did the best she could with what she had, Rio couldn’t fault her for that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that why you became a marital therapist? Try and keep the nuclear family model together because you didn’t have it?” Agatha asked while taking another bite of her food.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we agreed to no head shrinking tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmmh, not so fun is it?” Agatha joked and took a sip of her wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “A wise woman once told me that’s why everyone hates shrinks.”
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the meal went the same, laughing, talking, discussing seemingly insignificant topics. Near the end, the record playing in the living room ran out of songs. Agatha collected their plates and deposited them in the sink before topping off their wine glasses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Any requests?” She asked as they both made their way back to the living room. Agatha motioned her head towards the endless collection of vinyl. Some records were on a shelf mounted to the wall, but most were in crates on the floor. Agatha took a seat on the hardwood before sifting through the variety of plastic discs, Rio sat next to her and joined in the search.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, how many records do you have? This is insane.” Rio was quite honestly a little impressed. Most looked like original presses from their respective decades, a few contemporary artists but Agatha obviously favored the 70s and 80s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I stopped keeping count a long time ago, I’ve been collecting since college.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Smiths, really? And you called me pretentious?” Rio rhetorically asked while holding up the record.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you have against the Smiths?” Agatha took the record from Rio and set down her wine before standing and taking the record out, and setting it up on the console.
    </p>
<p>
     “The type of people who listen to the Smiths, usually can’t shut up about listening to the Smiths.” Rio stood too, making her way behind Agatha who just scoffed at her opinion.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio encircled her arms around Agatha’s waist again, watching over Agatha’s shoulder as she set the needle against the record. She felt Agatha relax a little in her arms, it made Rio smile as she started moving Agatha’s hair to one side of her neck. She nosed along the line of the now exposed skin and placed a soft kiss to Agatha’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn’t gotten to do this yet. She hadn’t gotten to hold Agatha, kiss her just because she could, spend time doing nothing. It made her want more, more touch, more time, more moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tipped her head back, allowing Rio more access, and let out a quiet moan. Too quiet. They finally had a place where they didn’t have to hide, Rio needed to hear every sound she could draw out of this woman. She grazed her teeth along Agatha’s neck before placing another series of open-mouthed kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby…” Agatha breathed out and wrapped one hand around her head to grab at Rio’s hair and gently fist the strands.
    </p>
<p>
     Another thing Rio needed more of, the pet names. It didn’t elude Rio that Agatha only ever used ‘baby’ when referring to her. Never ‘hon’ and certainly not ‘darling’. Rio could probably never hear those terms of affection again without wincing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned in her arms and grabbed her face to close the distance and kiss her. But it wasn’t a clash of tongue and teeth like their previous kisses, it was slow. It was passionate, but also deliberate, Agatha didn’t rush, she didn’t dominate, she just kissed Rio to kiss her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled back, Agatha’s hands stayed on her face, she didn’t break eye contact as she opened her mouth. “I’m leaving her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking hell. This woman wasn’t delicate about anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Was Rio having a stroke? Did she die and go to purgatory? One second she was kissing Agatha, and the next she was being told that she had successfully broken up a marriage.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio’s brows shot up, jaw wide open in shock.
    </p>
<p>
     “I spoke with a lawyer, the papers should be drafted by Monday.” Agatha said it as if it was nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why, why- why’d you do that?” Rio took a step back, now suddenly very aware of the gravity of the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I heard you kinda need divorce papers to, ya know…get divorced.” Agatha responded with a smile playing at her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re leaving Wanda? Since when? When did you call a fucking lawyer?” Rio was spiraling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thursday morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     Thursday morning? That was the day after they- Oh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thursday morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “You called a lawyer the morning after we-” Rio was going to hyperventilate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, calm down. It wasn’t for you. You saw what happened in your office today. I can’t do that for another three years, god forbid the rest of my life.” Agatha took a step towards Rio. “And, I’d like to spend time with you, get to know you, maybe get a little crazy and go on a real date.” She took a deep breath. “But even if you broke things off right now, I’d still leave her. With or without you, Rio, I have to get out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why didn’t you say something in session today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was going to, but then things just- they got away from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Understatement of the year.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re really doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am.” Agatha confirmed as she pulled Rio in again. She tucked a lock of hair behind Rio’s ear, and let her hand drop to cradle her jaw. She was smiling at Rio, not a care in the world, just the feeling of the light at the end of the tunnel.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay.” Because what else could Rio say? Agatha was getting her freedom, and Rio got to stop being the other woman. Still, there was something glaringly obvious that Rio had to point out. “So, for the record, I give that good of head? Like, life-altering, ‘call a lawyer’ level head.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “At least you’re humble about it.” And closed the distance once again. Kissing Rio with more intensity this time, moving her hand from her jaw, back to her hair. Rio curled one hand around Agatha’s belt buckle and tugged her a closer, opening her mouth to allow Agatha’s tongue to brush against hers. Agatha started walking them both across the living room until Rio’s back hit the wall. The kiss picked up as hands started pulling at Rio’s top.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take off your clothes.” Agatha demanded against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take off your wedding ring.”

     Chapter 10
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t see Agatha take off her wedding ring, but she felt it. She felt Agatha’s right hand leave her hair and the left leave her waist. She felt Agatha kiss her harder as she did so, then she felt those hands come back to her. They felt no different as they slid over her ass and hoisted Rio up so that she could lock her legs around Agatha’s waist.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t see her take off her wedding ring, but she heard it. She heard what sounded like a thin band of metal clatter against and roll across the hardwood, before falling over with a soft clink. She heard as Agatha’s mouth then dropped down and ravished her neck with kisses. She heard Agatha softly exhale in her ear and say “Your turn.”
    </p>
<p>
     How unceremonious.
    </p>
<p>
     How disrespectful.
    </p>
<p>
     How-
    </p>
<p>
     Undeniably. Fucking. Sexy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands, which were in Agatha’s hair, flew to the hem of her black knit sweater and ripped it off over her head, leaving her in a dark green bralette and jeans. Agatha’s pupils blew wide as she took in the expanse of the skin she never had available to her before.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to have to put me down if you want my pants off.” Rio teased as Agatha drooled over her.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Agatha’s hands braced and she lifted Rio away from the wall, all of her weight was now left in Agatha’s embrace. Before she could react to the show of strength, Agatha was moving.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell are you doing?” Rio quietly asked as she craned her neck to nip at the shell of Agatha’s ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Taking this to a fucking bed.” Agatha’s voice was low and gravelly as she made her way to the staircase, still holding Rio like she was nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and buried her face against Agatha’s neck as she felt them ascend the staircase, Agatha stopping every few steps to pin Rio back up against the wall and kiss her. She felt a few picture frames behind her be pushed ajar or fall to the stairs but the woman carrying her didn’t seem to notice, let alone care.
    </p>
<p>
     They got to the top of the stairs, and made their way to what Rio assumed was the primary bedroom. Agatha kicked the door shut behind them and slammed Rio onto the bed that was perfectly centered against the far wall. The force at which her body hit the mattress left her breathless as Agatha loomed over her, looking like she was about to unhinge her jaw.
    </p>
<p>
     “Too rough, baby?” But there was no real concern in Agatha’s voice, just taunting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio propped herself up on her elbows and smirked when Agatha moved to straddle her lap, reaching around to undo the clasp of Rio’s bralette and flinging it behind her. “C’mon, I know you can do better than that.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was a challenge, they both knew it. For the first time, Rio pushed back instead of complying. And the low growl that Agatha let out from the back of her throat in response lit Rio on fire. She wanted to see how far she could take this, how many of Agatha’s buttons she could press.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Agatha sounded completely disingenuous as she left Rio’s lap and stood in front of her at the foot of the bed. Rio worried for a moment that she had fucked up, then Agatha started undoing her button up. She let it fall open, pulled it out of where it was tucked into the waistband of her trousers, and pushed it off her shoulders. She moved to unbuckle her belt and stalked back to Rio on the bed. She settled herself on top of Rio once again, only left in a black lace bra and trousers.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, Rio was going to die. She was going to die underneath this woman wide-eyed and slack-jawed. She wanted to grab at Agatha, feel her skin, she began sitting up to do so when she was pinned back down flat on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand was against her sternum, keeping her trapped. The other still held her belt. “Put your wrists together.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had said it as a command, and while Rio knew she could refuse, why the fuck would she? The mere thought of Agatha tying her up made her clench around nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     She raised her hands above her head, wrists together, perfectly presented for Agatha. The older woman looked down at her with a wicked grin and secured the belt, successfully restraining Rio. She had enough wiggle room should she need it, but it was still tight enough to ground her. It was perfect. God, how many times had Agatha used her belt to restrain women she was fucking?
    </p>
<p>
     She made a mental note to obsess over that question later.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me know if you need to tap out, love.” Agatha murmured as she left filthy kisses over Rio’s neck. She trailed down to Rio’s collarbones and sucked at the skin until it was raw and bruised. Rio whined, at the hickeys or the new pet name, she didn’t really know. Her brain was gradually descending into madness, she was flooded with nothing but Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     When she felt lips wrap around her nipple, her back nearly snapped in half as she released a guttural moan. Agatha’s right hand grabbed the neglected breast and rolled her other nipple in time with her mouth. Rio’s hands twitched against the belt.
    </p>
<p>
     Her left hand teased at the button of Rio’s jeans, taking her time, torturing the woman under her. She wanted to savor Rio writhing beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…” Rio whimpered.
    </p>
<p>
     She ignored the plea and continued lavishing Rio’s tits, swirling her tongue before lightly biting down in the now hardened nub.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Rio sounded so weak already, like she was being consumed. Agatha probably loved it since she felt the other woman smile as she left another mark, one amongst many, on her chest. Rio needed more, she could feel herself fucking dripping between her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please.” And that seemed to make Agatha move, because of course it did. She kissed her way down Rio’s toned stomach and undid Rio’s jeans before pulling them off. Agatha stopped as she appreciated the masterpiece she had created. Rio, tied up on the bed, stripped down to her just underwear, flushed and waiting.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Agatha asked and slipped one of her legs between Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “You.” She rasped and instantly rolled her hips to grind down on the clothed thigh. Fuck, she was probaly ruining Agatha’s very expensive looking suit right now, but at this point, she was too gone to care.
    </p>
<p>
     “Going to have to be more specific.” Agatha’s hands were flirting with the cotton of Rio’s panties.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck me.” Rio bit out. “Use me, I don’t care. Just touch me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn't smile, so much as she manically bared her fucking teeth with the corners of her mouth upturned. She removed her thigh, ignoring Rio’s whines, and hooked her fingers into the waistband of Rio’s underwear. She expected Agatha to maybe rip them like she did her tights at the bar, but no, she was obviously determined to draw this shit out as long as possible and reduce Rio into a whimpering mess. And worse, she was fucking succeding.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha painstakingly peeled, the now ruined, underwear down Rio’s legs, stopping whenever she felt like it to leave a mark or a kiss. When the fabric was actually off of her, Agatha looked at Rio’s cunt like it was her salvation. Like she needed Rio the way humans need oxygen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was losing patience and she was losing it fast. If Agatha didn’t do something soon, she was going to take over. She knew Agatha wouldn’t give up control easily, but that’s kind of what made it hot.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally, finally brushed two fingers through Rio, making the younger woman obscenely moan. It was barely any contact, but with how pent up Rio felt in this moment, it was everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “So needy.” Agatha admonished as she kept stroking at Rio, never touching anything that would grant any relief. Just teasing.
    </p>
<p>
     And yeah, of course she was fucking needy. She had been toyed with for however long now, waiting and practically leaking for this woman to do something. Literally anything would be good right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, baby. I- just please.” Rio was close to tears with how desperate she had become.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply nodded her understanding and draped herself over Rio to kiss her. Rio felt those fingers stop stroking and push into her, backing arching, vocal cords fraying, eyes hooding. She couldn’t keep up with kissing Agatha anymore, she needed to scream, she needed to move. The fingers inside of her started off slow before gradually picking up speed, and Agatha found her way down between Rio’s thighs again. Her hand kept moving as her lips sucked around Rio’s clit, causing big brown doe eyes to snap shut.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt herself stretch as Agatha added a third finger and pumped, her free hand had a deathgrip on Rio’s hip.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m gonna-” She couldn’t finish the sentence before moaning at Agatha curling her fingers just right. She was right on the edge and Agatha didn’t seem to mind. She didn’t stop or make Rio beg, she just kept going.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would’ve enjoyed that observation had it not immediately been followed up with another.
    </p>
<p>
     When has a sadist ever just stopped being a sadist? Never.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wailed as she came, her wrists tensing against the leather of the belt, her hips rolling to meet every thrust. She felt Agatha keep her pace as Rio finished, even through the aftershocks. Then, she didn’t stop.
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking sadist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t even come down from the first orgasm before she felt the second take her under. Her hands now thrashing against the restraints. Her body was shaking and sweating, her lungs were burning. Agatha must’ve seemed to notice because she finally untangled herself from between Rio’s legs. She crawled up Rio’s body and immediately undid the belt and dropped it to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did so well for me, baby.” Agatha murmured against her ear, voice filled with genuine praise. It made Rio’s heart flutter in a way she didn’t want to think about yet. If Rio didn’t know any better, she’d think Agatha was done.
    </p>
<p>
     No, absolutely not.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that all you got?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened, her jaw steeled. Any affection now replaced with determination.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just thought you’d want your hands back for this.” Agatha’s cruel tone made her stomach twist in the most satisfying way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got off Rio, and reached into her nightstand and revealed a light purple stap-on.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, fuck yes.
    </p>
<p>
     No, wait, no no no.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that I’m not interested but I think I’m drawing the line at using your marital strap.” Rio said as she propped herself up once more.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha furrowed her brows at the assumption. “My what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not using that on me after using it with her however many times.” Rio might have some gray morals, but this one was stark white.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed out a laugh. “This isn’t my- I never-” She smirked as she continued. “I use it on myself, Rio.” She then clicked the side of it where an invisible button seemed to be, and the dildo started lightly buzzing.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
     Ohhhhhhh.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I can assure you, I’ve cleaned it.” She added and waved the lilac appendage for emphasis.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting fucked with the same strap Agatha fucks herself with? She squeezed her legs together. “Put it on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha threw the strap and the harness onto the bed, unclasped her bra and started unbuttoning her pants.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw her opening.
    </p>
<p>
     She got up from the bed, approached Agatha, and fell to her knees. “Let me help.” And took over the task of undoing the trousers, revealing matching black lace panties.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward to mouth over the lace, hearing a sharp intake of oxygen from above her. She looked up at Agatha, now completely naked from the waist up, Rio struggled to keep her breath even. If worshipping this woman was a religion, Rio would be a devout follower.
    </p>
<p>
     “She was a fucking idiot not to touch you.” She didn’t even know she was going to say that out loud, Rio thought she’d only said it in her own head. But the words seemed to do something to Agatha, who just pulled Rio up and crashed their lips together. This- this was the type of kiss Rio was familiar with. Aggressive, all-consuming, messy, but it held more meaning than previous ones. Like Agatha couldn’t verbalize what this meant to her, so she tried to pour it into the kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get on the bed.” Agatha directed when Rio slid one hand into her underwear. Rio assumed she was being denied access to Agatha again, maybe as some sort of foreplay. That was until Rio laid back down and was greeted with a now naked Agatha crawling up her body. But she didn’t stop at Rio’s waist or hips, she kept fucking going, straddling Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, inturn, wrapped her arms around milky white thighs. She was salivating at the prospect of what was about to happen. Her hands resting on Agatha’s ass, god her ass was amazing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Show me what you would’ve done if you had me these last three years then, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Completely inappropriate and so, so hot. Rio pulled Agatha’s center down to her tongue, both women moaned at the contact at the same time. Agatha closed her eyes and threw her head back, one hand gripping the headboard and the other behind her on Rio’s hip.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t close her eyes and miss the sight above her. Agatha naked, beasts bouncing as she rode Rio’s tongue, hair downright disheveled, and her jaw hanging open in pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Agatha gasped.
     <br/>
     Rio momentarily pulled away. “You gonna last longer than a couple of minutes this time?” She taunted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck you.” The woman sitting on her face ground out.
    </p>
<p>
     “You just did.” Rio snarked and returned her tongue back to Agatha’s delicious cunt in full force.
    </p>
<p>
     That did something for Agatha who started grinding her hips faster. Moving her hand from Rio’s hip to her hairline, gathering the strands and yanking her forward for more pressure.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s slick was now spread from the bottom of Rio’s chin, to the bridge of her nose. However, with the screams the older woman was releasing, Rio didn’t give a damn. In fact, maybe she’ll never wash her face again. Or she’ll just keep eating until she suffocates embedded between Agatha’s legs. Either option sounded great, she wasn’t picky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, fuck!” Agatha yelled as she rode her face somehow even faster. She could tell Agatha was close, she just needed something to tip her over the edge. Rio brought her arms to Agatha’s upper back, dug her nails into the skin there, and clawed red marks as deep as possible without drawing blood. Agatha’s back arched in response, the pleasure mixing with the pain. She heard Agatha come, she saw her, but more than anything she tasted her.  She never wanted to rid her mouth of that heavenly flavor.
    </p>
<p>
     Her thighs were shaking around Rio’s head, her back was now hunched over, lungs heaving. She then slung her leg back over and collapsed onto her back next to Rio, who promptly curls into her and delicately traces over her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just gimme a minute.” Agatha breathes out.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanna make you scream like that again.” Rio says and cups the mess she’s now made of Agatha’s cunt.
    </p>
<p>
     She huffed out a laugh at Rio’s request and flipped them over so Rio was now under her. “Maybe if you’re good.” She got up and made quick work of putting on the harness and securing the strap. “Bend over.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scrambled to get on her hands and knees facing away from her, she knew she was soaked down her thighs from making Agatha come.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt the bed dip, and warm hands caress over her ass and lower back. Then one snaked its way to the nape of her neck, tangling into the roots of her hair. Agatha ran the tip of the strap through Rio a few times, spreading the slick across her fake cock.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, love.” Rio whispered, she needed Agatha inside of her this way, she craved it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tightened her grip in Rio’s hair and fastened her grip with her other hand on Rio’s hip, and pulled both towards her as her hips rocked forward. She sank slowly into Rio halfway before pausing, hearing Rio’s cries at the intrusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Her voice was laced with sincerity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t stop, d-don't stop.” Rio begged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sank to the hilt before slowly pulling almost the whole way out, and snapping her hips forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “GOD.” Rio groaned out as she collapsed into the pillows.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t sure how long Agatha fucked her like that for, just that after each time Rio came, she’d mold her into a new position. Agatha made her ride, had her against the wall, each time more punishing than the last. She’d lost track of her orgasms when they were on their last round. She was on her back and Agatha was on top of her, only it wasn’t manic like the other rounds. Agatha’s head was buried in the crook of her neck. Her arms wrapped under Rio’s back, pulling her flush against Agatha. It was slower, intimate even.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s whole body felt numb afterwards, her eyes droopy as she stared at the ceiling with a dumb, lazy smile. Agatha discarded the strap and grabbed a robe, leaning over Rio to inform her. “I'm going to grab some water, I’ll be right back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed in acknowledgement and saw the brunette exit the room. She could get used to this, the sex, the date, the connection. She liked this, maybe a little too much.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha returned, she placed the glass on Rio’s nightstand. She sat next to her and rested her hand on Rio’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you walk well enough for a shower?” She grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t give yourself too much credit.” Rio’s legs were still twitching, but she didn’t want to give the satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, come on.” She stood and held her hand out for Rio to take.
    </p>
<p>
     The shower was hot and it helped her sore muscles, Agatha washed Rio’s hair and lathered her body. It wasn’t even made to be a thing, Agatha just started to do it on her own accord.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, Rio liked her so much.
    </p>
<p>
     She gently pressed Agatha against the tile and dropped her hand to the apex of Agatha’s legs.
    </p>
<p>
     “One more.” Rio murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     “One more.” Agatha moaned in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Rio woke up to something hard pressed against her throat, she soon discovered it to be Agatha’s nose. She was completely melded into Rio’s side. She had never seen the woman so relaxed. She brought her index finger to gently follow the slope of Agatha’s nose, as a result blue eyes jolted open. She felt Agatha tense before realizing she was wrapped in Rio’s arms and relaxed once again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning.” Rio rasped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmmhh.” Agatha resisted waking and burrowed into Rio’s neck further.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a morning person?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” Muffled against Rio’s skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your pouting at waking up at almost ten in the morning is adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha roused and pulled away before sitting up. “Would me grabbing us breakfast also be adorable?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What, you throw in the towel at cooking one meal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I just barely have any food here. I usually just use this place as a crash pad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But the sex toys make the cut?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gotta have the essentials.” She winked as she stood and made her way to the bathroom. When she returned she threw on some high-waisted jeans, a black tshirt, and clipped her hair up.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha freshed face and in casual clothing made Rio blush in a way she couldn’t explain. She moved to get dressed too when Agatha stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Looking for my clothes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t, just stay like that.” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘I’m not walking around your house naked. Sounds cold.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Agatha turned to riffle through her drawers. “Here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had gotten her underwear back on when a very well-loved Columbia pullover was tossed at her. She pulled it over her head, it smelled like Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to give me some pants?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a sweet kiss and pulled back. “No. I wanna fuck you like a demon when I get back.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you not fuck me like a demon last night??” Should Rio worry for her life? Jesus Christ.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not even close, baby.” Agatha was smiling, it reached her eyes. “Now, coffee order?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Iced coffee, oatmilk, and as many pumps of vanilla as they'll allow.”
    </p>
<p>
     She chuckled. “I’ll see if they have a cap. I’ll be back in twenty.” She kissed Rio again before making her way downstairs where Rio heard the front door open and shut.
    </p>
<p>
     She checked her phone, responded to a few emails and a text from Alice and went downstairs. The damage of the night was…substantial.  The few picture frames were still on the stairs, luckily none broke. When she walked into the living room, her mind flashed back to the several hours prior. The half-drank wine was left on the floor next to the records. How she had given Agatha shit over her music taste. The Smiths record still sat on the console, left to sit after running out of music long ago. Rio’s sweater was flung over a lamp. How she’d ripped off the top like it was going to burn her. Finally, the small circular piece of silver that sat on the floor near the area rug. When Rio demanded proof of Agatha’s claims, she couldn't comply fast enough. Rio took in the whole room, and beamed. They could have something real.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio crossed the room and picked up The Smiths record to place it safely back in the sleeve when she heard the door unlock and open.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t turn her back to greet Agatha, just smirked. “I still stand by my Smiths slander.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nothing came back, no smart-ass remark. The vibe was not the same one Agatha left with.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s whole body tensed, in one millisecond, she knew something was wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dr. Vidal?” A familiar voice questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     Not Agatha’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was acutely aware of how the room looked, and the fact that she was in panties and an oversized sweater that definitely didn’t cover her ass.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to see the source of the voice.
    </p>
<p>
     She was going to be sick.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stared at her with pure vitriol.
    </p>
<p>
     God hates Rio Vidal.

     Chapter 11
    </p>
<p>
     God loves Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     As she made her way back from the local coffee shop a few blocks from her home, Agatha was sure she had been rewarded by some divine right. The reward in question being the most ethereal, empathetic, smart-ass she’d ever had the pleasure of spending her night with.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything about her made Agatha smile in the most foolish way. Rio challenged her, gave her shit, she held her accountable. Rio saw underneath Agatha’s harsh exterior and simply melted right through it. Rio made her feel cared for in a way that she was beginning to think she had never experienced before. Rio was patient, and sweet, and kind of a freak in bed which is always a plus. And she was actually interested in Agatha, how the fuck Agatha manged to reel her in for more than just sex, she wasn’t sure. But Rio made her want to be better, do better, open up more. She felt safe with Rio, one might even say vulnerable. Not that Agatha would say that, but one might.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha would get the divorce papers by Monday, confront Wanda, and finally be free. It almost felt too good to be true, too real, too perfect.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was balancing the tray of coffees and the bag of pastries (far too many pastries) and reached into her coat pocket for her keys, when she heard a muffled sound from the other side of her front door.
    </p>
<p>
     Odd.
    </p>
<p>
     She was standing on the porch, still fishing around in her godforsaken pockets.
     <br/>
     Her fingers were almost numb from the cold as they trembled to insert the key and turn the lock. She rushed in, set the coffee and pastries down on the table near the door, and pulled her jacket off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, I’m back! I ended up going with seven pumps because any more should be considered a war crime.” She announced, sliding off her boots. Before Rio could answer, Agatha was making her way down the hall towards the living room. “And I swear to god, if you put on pants-” She began as she turned into the living room, only to be met with her own personal fucking nightmare.
    </p>
<p>
     Across the room stood Rio who was, still in fact, pantsless. But Agatha couldn’t appreciate it because a few feet in front of Rio, stood her almost ex-wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck her fucking life.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked at Agatha with such disdain, she could assume the redhead was trying to kill her with her mind alone. Her head tilted slightly as she just stared at Agatha, waiting for an explanation. Guess old habits die hard, because Agatha wasn’t going to explain dick to this woman.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hiya, hon.” Agatha sarcastically greeted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really? That’s all you have to say?” Wanda spit out.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, actually. What the fuck are you doing here?” She snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have fucking keys and we’re married.” Wanda aggressively jangled her keyring at Agatha and then motioned behind herself. “Better question is: What the fuck is SHE doing here?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had her arms wrapped around herself, trying to take up the least amount of space possible, like if she did that then maybe she’d just disappear entirely. It broke her heart a bit, knowing how this must be making Rio feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, she’s my new best friend.” Agatha made her eyes oblivious and voice sound dumb as she fucked with Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of all the women you could have fucked, YOU CHOSE OUR MARRIAGE THERAPIST?” Wanda shrieked. And while Agatha understood the anger, she really did, Jesus Christ the volume.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re right here.” Agatha deadpanned as she rubbed her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop being a heinous bitch for two seconds, and talk!”
    </p>
<p>
     That struck a chord with Rio. “Okay, let’s take a breath and refrain from name call-”
    </p>
<p>
     But Wanda cut her off and snapped her head in Rio’s direction. “Shut up, I should report you!” Wildly pointing her finger at the doctor. “You’re not our therapist anymore, just the slut who I’ve been paying to spread her legs open for my wife, apparently.”
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, now Agatha was pissed, especially because she saw Rio’s eyes well and her tongue push against her cheek, like she was fighting not to sob. Should Agatha worry what it says about herself that she’s angrier about Rio crying than she is guilty about Wanda finding out? Maybe. But she sure as shit wasn’t going to unpack that now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough, Wanda.” Agatha scolded and pushed past the redhead. She collected Rio’s sweater off the lamp and walked over to Rio. “Here. Go upstairs, get dressed. I’ll handle her. I’m so sorry.” Agatha whispered to her as she handed over the top from the night prior. Rio didn’t acknowledge or say anything, she didn’t even look Agatha in the eye, just took her sweater and booked it out of the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     “So our marriage is left in shambles and the first thing you do afterwards is get on your knees for the professional who’s supposed to help us?” Wanda said as Rio was heading up the stairs. “Do you realize how fucked up you are to do that, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, unfortunately I do, but it wasn’t like that.” Agatha said honestly, finally engaging with the reality of the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, sorry,” Wanda started in a fake apologetic tone. “Am I getting the logistics wrong? Did she get on her knees?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha worked her jaw, she needed a cigarette as a prize for dealing with this, and she didn’t even smoke anymore. “Why are you here, Wanda?” She prompted again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I came to apologize for yesterday like an adult. However, I probably would’ve held off had I known what I was walking into.” Wanda huffed. “I mean really, Aggie, way to keep it classy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh you want to talk about class acts, hon? Who the fuck have you been putting out for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “ ‘Putting out’..?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, what were you doing last night that you waited twenty-four hours to come see your darling wife? If you’re just so tortured over our kerfuffle from yesterday, where have you been?” Agatha accused, standing a little taller, more intimidating.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda didn’t say anything, clearly trying to think of a plausible excuse.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept going. “Because to me, it’s pretty damn clear that if you felt that guilty, you would’ve stopped by last night. Or called, or texted, or sent a fucking carrier pigeon.” She held up her hands in a dramatic flourish. “And yet, I have received none of the above.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re fucking insufferable.” Wanda muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re deflecting.” Agatha smiled. “So, maybe Rio and I aren't so different from you and your sidepiece, yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     Not that Agatha thought of Rio as a sidepiece, but she had to get the upper hand back somehow.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda scoffed. “That’s not true, Nat isn’t-” And cut herself off, eyes wide, realizing her mistake.
    </p>
<p>
     “NAT? As in Natasha?” Agatha’s jaw dropped in shock.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just stood there like a deer in headlights.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you’re here playing the martyr about Rio, when you’ve been fucking around with your physically flawless personal trainer?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long?” Agatha questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Six months.” She replied in a hush tone.
    </p>
<p>
     The tension finally burst.
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha-
    </p>
<p>
     Well, she fucking lost it.
    </p>
<p>
     It started with a low chuckle, then it evolved into an actual laugh, and after a minute she had graduated to a full witch’s cackle. The absurdity of it all, the irony that she too had been paying a woman to spread her legs for her wife. She keeled over and couldn’t catch her breath, the situation was ridiculous. She felt tears run down her face from how hard she was laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t sure how much time had passed while she had her fit of hysteria, but she knew it was far too long to be considered polite by most of society.
    </p>
<p>
     When she looked up, Wanda was in front of her, surprisingly also giggling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, we’re so fucked up.” Wanda laughed, partially covering her mouth with her hand. The statement didn’t hold any ill-will, just the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha composed herself enough to speak. “So, that night that you ‘got drinks with Monica’?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was dinner with Nat!” Wanda dropped her head and chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was with Rio!” Agatha snorted.
    </p>
<p>
     They were talking like two girls bonding at a sleepover, gossiping as if the topic wasn’t each other’s infidelity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, on Tuesday, when we lent her your shirt, I saw the marks on her neck and just thought she had gotten some.” Wanda chortled. “But it was you!”
    </p>
<p>
     “What about you? ‘Oh, my stars and garters! My rings kept sliding in the cold, so naturally I take them off and that’s not at all suspicious!’” Agatha said, doing an exaggerated impression of Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     They were fully manic now, and in a deeply fucked up way, it was the happiest memory Agatha had created with her wife in years. For the first time in a long time, they were honest with each other, they didn’t walk on eggshells, there was no judgement. How dead does a relationship have to be for cheating to make it bearable again?
    </p>
<p>
     When they had both calmed down again, the conclusion of the conversation was clear: their marriage was over.
    </p>
<p>
     It was over long ago, but now they were facing the inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am sorry, though, Wanda. For everything.” And she meant it. Wanda wasn’t a bad person, she just wasn’t Agatha’s person. Not anymore. She hadn’t been for at least six months. “Do you love her?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda was wearing her real smile, the one that reached her eyes. “I think I do, yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well then, I hope you live out your Dick Van Dyke, Donna Reid, Brady Bunch wet dream with her.” Agatha genuinely meant it, she wanted to be happy and wanted the same for Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry too, Aggie. For everything.” Wanda sounded sincere as she gestured for a hug. To which, Agatha nodded, wrapping her arms around the other woman she would always care for, but no longer loved. At least, not in the way she once did.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate that stupid fucking nickname.” Agatha huffed out, her hands resting on Wanda’s shoulder blades.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda giggled again, her jaw sat atop Agatha’s shoulder. “Give me a divorce, and I’ll call you whatever you want.” She could hear the tears at the back of her wife’s throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Already called the lawyer.” Agatha informed, getting a little misty-eyed, and felt Wanda sigh in contentment.
    </p>
<p>
     They were finally moving on with their lives. It had transpired in probably the least healthy way possible, but at least they had found a resolution. It felt bittersweet to come to the reality of it all, she still remembered the person who she fell in love with five years ago, but it wasn’t the one currently in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard the stairs creak behind them. She turned her head and, there at the bottom of the steps, stood Rio now dressed in her sweater and jeans. She didn’t look relieved like Agatha thought she would, though.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she looked almost pained. Her eyes were glassy and her lip was basically curled into a snarl.
    </p>
<p>
     And that’s when it hit Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her arms are still wrapped around Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, did it look like they were reconciling?
    </p>
<p>
     Getting back together?
    </p>
<p>
     It definitely did because Rio bolted for the door, grabbing her jacket and shoes in the time it took for Agatha to drop her arms away from her ex.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha ran to the front door to catch her, however once she got down the hallway she only saw the back of Rio as the door slammed behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     She, for lack a better term, hauled ass to the door, yanked it open and stepped out onto the porch. Fuck, she hadn’t grabbed a jacket or shoes, her socks were now wet with snow remnants. She caught the last glimpse of Rio reaching her black sedan, getting in, and peeling out.
    </p>
<p>
     Damn, she really wanted out of here, she didn’t even let her car warm up.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went back inside and frantically searched for her things, her stomach felt queasy, her heart weighed a thousand pounds, she had just gotten somewhere good with Rio. Somewhere viable, and honest. And Agatha had to ruin it like she ruins everything, her mother got that much right. As she searched for her keys, Wanda approached.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was only now registered that she was bawling. “Rio, uh- she left. I have to find her.” She sniffled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, do you have her address?” Wanda's tone was comforting.
    </p>
<p>
     Wow they weren’t even divorced yet and Wanda was her wingwoman.
    </p>
<p>
     Yikes, therapy was never going to save them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, no.” Agatha gave a sad smile. She was so into Rio, yet knew none of the surface level stuff. What’s her favorite color, or her middle name? Where’d she grow up or go to college? Jesus, Agatha sucked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is she answering her phone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled her phone out from her back pocket and tried calling-
    </p>
<p>
     Straight to voicemail.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck.” Agatha whispered as she felt another wave of tears spill over. She sent a series of texts, none marked as read.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, she’ll come around.” Wanda soothed and placed her hand on Agatha’s arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would Nat come around if she saw us hugging?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, no, she’d just beat you up.” Wanda grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “She could too, I’ve seen her arms.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, her arms.” Wanda said dreamily.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wiped her face of the tears and snorted irreverently. “Like marble.”
    </p>
<p>
     She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and dropped her head into her hands. She felt Wanda sit beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your mother wasn’t right, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “About you. I just said that to hurt you, but it isn’t true.” Wanda was serious. She must’ve seen the self-doubt running through Agatha’s head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eh, I pour salt in your emotional wounds, you set mine on fire. It was a cute back and forth we had.” Agatha brushed off the sentiment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aggie-” Wanda then corrected herself. “Agatha, I only made us go to therapy because I know who you are. You’re resilient, and kind when you want to be, and a huge pain in the ass.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a tired laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted to exhaust all options before giving all that up.” Wanda finished.
    </p>
<p>
     “That is so disturbing that you were thinking that while chasing Russian tail.”
    </p>
<p>
     “God forbid a woman have hobbies.” Wanda joked.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you going to do now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was telling the truth about Monica wanting me to come back, and since I’ll no longer be a housewife…” She gave a pointed look. “I’m taking it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s great, Wanda. I think you’ll be amazing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, and maybe Nat and I will give it a real go.” She beamed. “What about you? Is Rio something real?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well assuming you don’t report her,” Agatha raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     “She barely counseled us, I won’t ruin her highly unethical career over that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then yeah, she’s something real.” Agatha looked down at her shaky hands. “She’s everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda stood abruptly and pulled Agatha to her feet. “Okay, c’mon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?” She asked as Wanda yanked her through the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need a drink after that, and I know you keep the good scotch here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s eleven in the morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah and we just accepted the fate of our doomed marriage, I think we get to be a little reckless.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s all we’ve been Wanda, is reckless.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda smiled and started pouring the booze into tumblers, they both took a sip and sat in silence for a few minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want the house in the divorce.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed and downed her glass.
    </p>
<p>
     “Burn it for all I care.”

     Chapter 12
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t even sure where she was driving to when she left Agatha’s, she just knew she had to get out. She had heard bits and pieces of their conversation in between getting dressed. She didn’t want to eavesdrop, especially after being their literal therapist. Rio figured the less she knew, the better. However, the house was old, drafty, carried sound and so she heard things. She had heard Wanda say something about Agatha getting on her knees for Rio, the word “sidepiece” come out of Agatha’s mouth, and the two of them laughing like fucking hyenas. It went quiet afterwards, Rio was dressed and she couldn’t stand the thought of Agatha facing the conflict alone. So, she made her way downstairs. And god, she’s been stupid this whole time, but this one takes the fucking cake.
    </p>
<p>
     There stood Agatha and Wanda-
    </p>
<p>
     Hugging.
    </p>
<p>
     Touching.
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking embracing.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha finally saw her, she had the look of a kid who got caught red handed with their hand in the cookie jar.
    </p>
<p>
     Well at least it finally clicked for Rio. She was a fucking idiot for trusting Agatha, for thinking she was anything to her besides a good lay. Fuck, they probably got off on this or some shit. Do they try to find the most inappropriate person to cheat with, fuck them, fight, and then fuck each other? It was the only explanation. Why else were they embracing each other? At least she got there before they started fucking, if she had to witness that, she’d drive into Lake Michigan just to forget.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had called after her as she left, but she didn’t want to hear whatever lies, whatever excuses Agatha would supply. She needed to get away from her and her wife who was probably about to report Rio to the American Psychiatric Association.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘You just had to fuck a client, didn’t you? Cause there’s no other option in a city of almost three million people, right? Now you’re gonna lose your job for being a slut.’
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing as Rio is a woman, she’d been called a slut before, usually by insecure men or by very hot, very secure women in bed. But when Wanda called her that, it had taken the air out of her lungs. She couldn’t even deny it. What she did was slutty, even just objectively.
    </p>
<p>
     She had turned off her phone around Agatha’s twelfth attempted phone call, fortieth text, and second voicemail. She didn’t feel like being manipulated.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until her hand shifted the gear to ‘park’ did Rio realize where she had ended up.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to talk to someone, and if Wanda was going to ruin her career anyways, Rio might as well cry on her best friend’s shoulder about it.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got up to Alice’s door she basically fucking pounded on it, she didn’t mean to, she was just coursing with adrenaline. She didn’t stop banging until Alice unlocked and opened the door. When it swung open, it revealed Alice in a pair of boxers and an oversized band tee. Her hair was a mess and that was definitely a hickey on her neck. Fucking honeymoon stage.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, what the hell?” Alice yawned.
    </p>
<p>
     “How much do you love me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, you don’t usually bang on my door at eleven o’clock on a Saturday morning. So, like, the normal amount?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled, wiping a few tears that escaped. “I’m serious, Alice. Like, if I killed a guy, would you love me enough to help bury the body? What if I did something worse?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s blasé demeanor dropped, she tensed her posture. “Yeah, of course. I mean especially if it was a guy, you probably had your reasons.” She grabbed Rio’s arm and guided her inside and to the couch in the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s apartment wasn’t that different from her office, total 70’s acid trip vibe. Although, here in the comfort of her own home, Alice mixed that with more goth and punk elements. Once settled on the velvet couch, Alice prompted Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Obviously, I love you, Rio. What’s going on?” She scrunched her face in worry.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did something really bad.” Rio was barely keeping her shit together right now, the wind could breeze past and she’d shatter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever it is, can’t be that bad, hon.” Alice grabbed her hand and tried to comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio broke down.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice just haaaad to say ‘hon’.
    </p>
<p>
     Stupid fucking pet name.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grabbed Rio’s face and started wiping her tears, but it was no use, they were coming quicker than Alice could clean.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, you’re starting to freak me out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I, I-” Rio was trying to spit it out through the racking sobs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri, it’s okay. Just tell me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know the couple that I’ve been counseling?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Teddy bear and the snake?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about them?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I,” Rio took a deep breath and blew it out, willing her tears to calm. “I slept with the snake, I slept with Agatha.” She uttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s jaw dropped open. Her eyes as wide a fucking saucers. Oh, god, she was judging, and Rio couldn’t blame her.
    </p>
<p>
     “WHAT?!” But it wasn’t Alice who screamed, suddenly the bedroom door was ripped open and Jen appeared wearing linen pajama pants and a pink sweater. She had this horrified look on her face and Rio wished nothing more than to dissolve into herself at this current moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s been fooling around too?” Jen was now making her way into the living room, standing opposite where Rio and Alice were sitting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, the teddy bear was also cheating?” Alice questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well Agatha didn’t have any hard evidence, but she was pretty sure of it, yeah. She told me about Wanda, but she didn’t tell me about Rio. Oh my god, no wonder you two were gone at the bar for so long that night.” Jen was connecting the dots.
    </p>
<p>
     “You fucked her at the bar that night?” Alice was obviously trying very hard not to raise her voice in judgement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio murmured, not pointing out that technically, Agatha fucked her. Now was not the time for semantics.
    </p>
<p>
     “So why are you freaking out about it now?” Her best friend asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because, we’ve slept together two more times since then.” It was barely audible, Rio didn’t want to say it. “And we spent the night together last night, and then this morning,-” She was going to start crying again. “Her wife found us.” And the dam flooded yet again. “And,” She swallowed all the excess spit and snot in her throat. “I think they reconciled. I don’t think Agatha wants me.” She felt like she was going to drown in her sorrow, she couldn’t fucking stop, she was blubbering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, Ri-” Alice softly said as she pulled Rio against her chest and rubbed her back in circles.
    </p>
<p>
     “She said she wanted to leave her. She said she wanted to be with me.” Rio sounded like a hysterical high school girl who just got cheated on by the quarterback at prom. All delusion, no substance.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was still soothing her when she responded. “Rio, you should know better than anybody that they never leave their wife. There’s like a million sayings about cheating for this specific reason. Like, how you got ‘em is how you lose ‘em.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Once a cheater, always a cheater.” Jen added.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you can take him from me, he’s yours.” Alice kept going.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it!” Rio sat up. “I fucking get it.” Rio conceded.
    </p>
<p>
     “How was the sex though?” Alice raised eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a watery chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Babe!” Jen shouted in offense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well it had to be good to risk her career!” She defended.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her hands. “It was fucking amazing, okay?” She pointed her gaze at Jen then Alice. “Like, the best I’ve ever had. And she, like, picked me up at one point and tossed me like a ragdoll. I don’t even know how she did that-”
    </p>
<p>
     “She rock climbs,” Jen sounded annoyed. “I’m surprised she didn’t tell you that, she’s usually really obnoxious about-” She stopped at the sound of her phone ringing.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen pulled it out of her pocket and looked at the caller ID. “Oh shit, it’s Agatha.” Jen looked panicked as she glanced between Alice and Rio for instructions on what to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t- I don’t know.” Rio answered the silent question, she was so tired from crying her head felt light.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen just sighed and answered the call. “Hey, what’s up?” Jen asked as if nothing in the world could be wrong. Rio heard Agatha’s voice on the other end of the call, but not well enough to make anything out. Jen quickly covered the bottom of her phone so Agatha wouldn’t hear. “Agatha asked if I’m with Alice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Rio just stare at her with a look that communicates ‘obviously’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, well fuck me for checking.” Jen scolds the other two women and holds her phone back to her ear. “Yeah, why?” Jen nodded and covered her phone again, turning to Rio and Alice yet again. “She wants me to ask Alice for Rio’s address.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No. No way.” Rio confidently answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Agatha, I don't think I should do that.” Jen’s face dropped as she listened to Agatha’s response. She covered her phone. “She’s…begging. Like, legitimately begging. She sounds like she’s been crying. I’ve never heard her like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucks sake.” Rio got up and snatched Jen’s phone. How fucking dare Agatha play the victim right now? She toyed with Rio for two weeks and now she was crying? No. Fuck her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop calling me, stop texting me. I’m done.” Rio shouted into the phone before hanging up and handing it back to Jen. “I gotta go. I need a drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not even noon yet.” Jen quietly said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah well, you try sleeping with a married woman for two weeks and thinking it was heading somewhere real, only to find her getting back with her wife who she claimed she hated! Then see if you wanna stay sober, Jen.” Rio had fully fucking cracked at this point.
    </p>
<p>
     She started for the door and heard Alice say. “Hey, call me later and don’t give yourself bangs, please!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flipped her off as she left. “That was one time!”
    </p>
<p>
     Once the door was shut, a voice that belonged to Jen said. “It’s like a fucking episode of The L Word.”
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     It had been nine days.
    </p>
<p>
     Nine days since she told off and then blocked Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Nine days of flower deliveries to her office, each day more extravagant than the last. The bouquets kept getting bigger, the notes longer and sappier. Begging Rio to call her, to hear her out, to come over. It took everything in Rio not to give in.
    </p>
<p>
     Nine days of Alice hovering over Rio as if she might, at any moment, break like fine china. Even Lilia caught on to Rio’s mood. When she asked her about it, Rio had just stated “Girl problems.” To which Lilia of course said. “Rio, I told you, say the word and I’ll set you up with a nice Sicilian girl!” She didn't want a nice Sicilian girl, she wanted her mean WASP-y woman.
    </p>
<p>
     At least Agatha had enough boundaries to not show up at Rio’s work. Not that she was praising Agatha for doing the bare fucking minimum. Yeah, Agatha had boundaries, but apparently her fucking wife didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda burst into her office Monday morning, nine days after catching Rio with her wife. God damnit, did she want to fight? This wasn’t fair, Rio knew how to kickbox, she’d take down Carrot Top in a second flat.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, was she here to report her? Rio had been waiting for that shoe to drop.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood from her desk, bracing herself as Wanda stormed in to stand in front of her desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dr.Vidal.” Wanda replied curtly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Given the circumstances, I think you can call me Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine. Why haven’t you called Agatha?” She scrunched her eyebrows together.
    </p>
<p>
     What. The. Fuck??
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you fucking with me right now?” Rio said with her eyes damn near bugging out of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she’s crushed and she won’t come here herself out of respect for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah and you don’t? Can’t respect the slut who made your poor, innocent wife stray, right?” Why the fuck was she here? What was this game?
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s face relaxed, genuine remorse took over. “I’m sorry, for calling you that. I was angry in the moment and it was hypocritical of me.” Wanda raised her left hand to rub her temples. Her empty left hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are your rings?” Rio clocked immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what Agatha’s been trying to tell you, dumbass.” It didn’t sound malicious though, it sounded like she was razzing Rio. “We’re divorcing. Should be finalized at the end of the month.” She explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “No. I saw you two right before I left. You were-” Rio began to defend herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “We were breaking up. We were together for five years, it was closure.” Wanda let out a breath. “And Agatha has been beside herself trying to prove it to you.” She then motioned to the several bouquets taking over Rio’s workspace. “Do you know what it’s like to have to comfort your almost ex-wife about her girlfriend ignoring her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Weird?” Rio guessed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, it’s fucking weird! So go fucking fix it!” Wanda waved her hands around at the same time to motivate the doctor.
    </p>
<p>
     So, Agatha had been telling the truth. She was still leaving Wanda, even without knowing where she stood with Rio. Fuck, she was telling the truth the whole time. About getting to know Rio, dating Rio, spending time with Rio. Agatha made an effort to be honest with Rio and she threw it back in Agatha’s face. She was vulnerable and Rio assumed the worst.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, fuck, fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Damnit.” Rio breathed and grabbed her jacket, phone and keys. She had to get to Agatha. She was nearly sprinting out of her office, then she stopped abruptly and turned to the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, Wanda.” Rio said it and meant it.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled. “You’re welcome, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio then turned on her heel and bolted out of the practice to her car. She got in, emailed her patients for the day that she needed to cancel their sessions, and left for Agatha’s place. Could her driving be described as sane? Not important.
    </p>
<p>
     She got there in fifteen minutes, parked very illegally, and climbed the stone steps of the townhouse. Before she could second guess herself, she pounded erratically on the door. Again, adrenaline pumping through her veins.
    </p>
<p>
     The door slowly opened and revealed Agatha. Or a version of Agatha. Her dark circles concealed by makeup, her face sunken in like she hadn’t been taking care of herself. She looked as put together as usual in her work attire, a black button up and purple slacks, but Rio could see through the visage.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman’s face rose in shock, like she’d seen a ghost.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio? What are you-”
    </p>
<p>
     She cut her off, grabbed Agatha’s face and kissed her. Kissed her like she never thought she’d get another chance. Kissed her like she felt the absence of Agatha in her very bones.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled Agatha as close as possible, tangling one of her hands in that unruly mane of hair. She peeked out her tongue and moaned when Agatha opened her mouth wider, angling the kiss deeper. She pressed their bodies flesh together, and just kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     After not enough time in Rio’s opinion, Agatha pulled back panting. She scanned Rio’s face as her eyebrows knit together in confusion. ‘Wha…?” Agatha didn’t finish, too breathless to form the whole word.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and simply told the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled too, her eyes lighting up, and chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you.”

     Chapter 13
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me in.” Rio gasped as she dove into Agatha for another kiss. It was all teeth and tongue, Rio felt feral for her in this moment. Agatha didn’t respond, she just grabbed Rio’s waist and pulled her in, walking them backwards until they had crossed the threshold into the house. Once in, Agatha pinned Rio’s body against the door to slam it closed. God, Rio had missed this, had missed her, the past week and a half was torture. It seemed Agatha felt the same by the way she was devouring Rio. Her hands roaming over and groping every part of Rio’s body, her ass, her hips, her tits, like she couldn’t decide what of Rio’s she wanted the most. Like she was still checking to make sure Rio was really here.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not that I’m not happy to see you,” Agatha started as she mouthed along Rio’s neck, causing the younger woman to whimper at the contact. “But how the hell are you here right now?” She husked out as she grazed her teeth along Rio’s ear, nibbling on the shell of it. Her hands worked at the buttons on Rio’s shirt before getting frustrated and ripping the fabric, buttons flying to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to say this one time, and one time only.” She panted as she felt Agatha untuck her shirt from her jeans. Did she want to give the credit? No. But despite everything, she had to give it where it was due. “Thank Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn, she really earned that house in the settlement.” Agatha absentmindedly responded, now reaching to the zipper of Rio’s pants. She was already so wet for Agatha, despite the very little physical contact. Masturbating to the other woman’s stolen panties over the past several days didn’t cut it compared to the real thing.
    </p>
<p>
     She expected Agatha to shove her hand into Rio’s jeans and fuck her right there, but instead, Agatha pulled away and got on her knees. She didn’t make a move towards Rio’s pussy though, she lifted one of Rio’s legs by her ankle and started unzipping one of Rio’s boots. As she did so, she made eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     “You still owe me an apology.” She said as she worked the zipper down and shimmied the boot off and moved to the other. “You assumed the worst of me,” Agatha flung the other boot away and sat Rio’s leg back down. “Blocked me,” Her hands now came to Rio’s waist, pulling down her jeans and helping Rio step out of them. “And made it very hard for me to stalk you and explain.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio now stood slumped against the front door of Agatha’s foyer, pants-less and with her once in-tact shirt ripped open. Could she hyperventilate from this alone? The possibility seemed likely. “I’m-” She yelped as she felt Agatha tongue over her increasingly soaked underwear. “I’m sorry, baby. I was a dick for not hearing you out, for assuming.” She looked down until she saw those crystal blue eyes meet her own, and grinned. “And for not being stalkable enough for you.” She teased. She was truly sorry, but had to point out the absurdity of Agatha’s frustration over the caliber of which Rio could be stalked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back and stood up, smiling in a way that told Rio she was not actually satisfied with her apology. “Not good enough.” Agatha turned around and started up the stairs, not looking to see whether Rio was following or not. She saw the other woman disappear upstairs and make her way to the end of the hall where her bedroom was.
    </p>
<p>
     What the hell? She just left Rio down here half naked and panting? Was this a punishment for a shitty apology? Rio stayed there leaning against the door, confused, for longer than she’d like to admit. Then, she heard that silky smooth voice call out “You coming?” Rio nearly tripped over her own fucking feet to reach her destination, almost running until she reached the threshold of Agatha’s bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     And fuck, what she saw when she arrived made her mouth go dry.
    </p>
<p>
     Apparently, Rio had spent enough time dumbfounded downstairs for Agatha to take off all her clothing, and put on the strap from last time. She sat at the edge of the bed radiating confidence as Rio unabashedly drooled over the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sit down, baby. We need to talk.” Agatha’s voice sounded dangerous, like she was trying to lure in her prey before snapping its neck.
    </p>
<p>
     It made a new rush of heat course down Rio’s stomach as she approached Agatha. She made her way over, about to take a seat on the bed next to Agatha, when those beautiful hands grabbed her waist and stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said. Sit.” Agatha repeated with more emphasis this time. Rio’s brain buffered for a minute before realizing what she meant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quickly stripped off what was left of her clothes, and climbed to straddle Agatha, moaning at the feeling of the strap making brief contact with her clit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rested her hands on Agatha’s shoulders as she lined herself over the strap and slowly sunk down, meeting no resistance. She had gotten halfway down when she felt Agatha’s hand come in between their bodies and click that stupid invisible button. One day Rio would find this mythical button and fucking gouge it out, because as the vibration started, Rio could no longer keep herself up. She simply melted the rest of the way until her hips became flush with Agatha’s, letting out a groan.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good job, sweetheart.” Agatha praised, her voice was laced with condescension but Rio didn’t care, she preened anyways.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio started rolling her hips, if she angled just right, the base of the strap rubbed against her clit. She had barely started when Agatha’s hands pinned her hips down, immobilizing them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agathaaaa…” Rio whined.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re just keeping my cock warm for me right now.” She smiled like the goddamn succubus she was. “I told you, we’re talking.” Agatha's fingers dug into Rio’s flesh hard enough to bruise. “I think we need to get a few things clear first, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was speaking like she wasn’t six fucking inches deep inside of her. “Mmhhhhh.” Rio agreed, knowing the only way she'd get to move was to play along.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good girl.” Agatha started kissing down Rio’s throat, but her hands didn’t budge. “Now, let’s start with the obvious. Your apology was…lacking. Try again.”
    </p>
<p>
     God, Agatha was getting off on this. On making Rio squirm in her lap. “I’m sorry, baby. I’m so fucking sorry.” Rio whimpered. “I was wrong, and I’ll never doubt you again. You were telling me the truth and I should've believed you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” She started chanting. “I’m sorry.” She kept going, lulling her head onto Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand left her hip and wrapped around the front of her neck, bringing her face back in front of Agatha’s. The hand still pinning her down squeezed in time with the one around her throat. “Fuck.” Rio moaned at the pressure.
    </p>
<p>
     “See? That wasn’t so hard.” Agatha spoke like she was talking to a clueless little kid. “Next, you thought I wanted someone else. So let’s rectify that, yeah?” Rio’s eyes were going to roll back in her head soon, she felt herself clench around the vibrating cock buried inside of her. She simply grunted an affirmation at Agatha’s question.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Wrong move.
    </p>
<p>
     “Answer me.” Was commanded as her hand choked Rio tighter, she could still breathe but it took more effort.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Her voice came out raspy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed satisfied. “You look so beautiful like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn’t expecting the compliment, it was genuine. “Like what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Under my control, my hand around your throat, my cock inside of you.” Agatha murmured. “Completely mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     That shouldn’t have made Rio’s stomach flutter, and yet here she was, feeling her chest warm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Say it.” Agatha instructed, eyes boring into Rio’s soul. “Say you're mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha accused her of being possessive? She made a note to store that away for later and tease Agatha about it mercilessly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m yours.” Rio breathed out easily. Rio had been Agatha’s ever since that first night, she had been Agatha’s even during their time apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Again.” Agatha had ordered and her grip on Rio’s hip lessened, encouraging her to move.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio instantly rolled her hips again, feeling how she was now dripping down the shaft. “I’m yours.” Her hands flew into Agatha’s hair as she sped up, dropping her face into the other woman's neck and nuzzling. Agatha’s hand left her neck and threaded into her hair at the back of her skull, gently scratching.
    </p>
<p>
     The base was grinding down on her clit, the vibrations were hitting her g-spot. She felt her thighs shaking, struggling to keep the pace as she felt herself getting close.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yours, yours, yours.” Rio felt tears starting to prick in the corner of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You take me so well, love.” Her hand found Rio’s clit and pressed. “My good girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her whole body seized as she felt her orgasm hit her, sobbing into the crook of Agatha’s neck. Her thighs tensed and clamped around Agtha’s hips, her fingers fisted and pulled on the older woman's hair. She felt her back hit the bed as Agatha rolled them over, pinning her wrists down and thrusting into Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She screamed out as Agatha fucked her while she was still coming down, her head tipping back, eyes slammed shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I missed you, baby.” It was a taunt as she pounded into Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…” Rio dumbly supplied, her brain unable to think of anything else. She opened her eyes enough to see the look on Agatha’s face. It was one of pure adoration, her eyes twinkling with an emotion Rio hadn’t seen from Agatha before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Missed your voice,” Agatha’s abs tensed with each thrust. Fuck, Rio wanted to lick the thin layer of sweat off those abs. “Your smile, your laugh, your skin.” Rio wasn’t going to last with the way Agatha was admiring her. “Missed your stupid smart-ass remarks.” Her back arched in response. “I missed everything about you, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her hips were snapping to meet Rio’s on every thrust, making sure Rio took her to the hilt every time. It was fast but also methodical, Agatha never half-assed anything, including fucking Rio into the matress. She craned her neck down and took one of Rio’s nipples into her mouth, sucking, before lightly biting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio came for the second time with the singular thought that she’d never be able to leave this woman again. She’d stay for as long as Agatha would allow, she’d follow this woman across centuries of time, across any universe.
    </p>
<p>
     But instead of those very sweet thoughts, her mouth produced a loud, obnoxious moan as she fluttered around the strap again. She felt Agatha’s weight settle on top of her and her hands release Rio’s wrists. It didn’t matter, she stayed starfished underneath Agatha trying to breathe again.
    </p>
<p>
     They laid like that for a few moments, Agatha massaging her thigh or her scalp, patiently waiting for Rio to come back to earth.
    </p>
<p>
     “So that’s what you meant by fucking me like a demon?” Rio rasped, opening her eyes to see Agatha looking completely enamored.
     <br/>
     She kissed Rio slowly before answering. “That depends.”
    </p>
<p>
     “On what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you go again?”
    </p>
<p>
     God help her, she will never say no to that question, leading Rio to three more orgasms, most of which happen while her face is planted in the pillows and her ass is up in the air. They fuck until the strap dies, no longer vibrating. When she collapses after coming for the fifth time before noon on a weekday, Agatha is right next to her encouraging her with soft words and praise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking demon woman.” Rio mutters as she curls into Agatha, feeling how tender she is between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckles “You love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Yeah, of course she does, she loves everything about what’s happening here. But again, she can’t give Agatha that satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your hubris should be studied.” Rio jokes before being jostled from where her head rests on Agatha’s sternum. She looks to see what Agatha’s doing for an explanation and is greeted with Agatha clacking away on her phone. “Wow, I thought we’d at least have a few good years before we started ignoring one another after sex.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth quirks up. “No, sorry, I just remembered I have a lecture in an hour.” She finished typing and sent an email before locking her phone and chucking it onto the ground. “There, it’s canceled.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You canceled your class for me?” Rio said quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I left my wife for you and you’re swooning that I’m skipping work?” She raised her eyebrows at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking hell, that’s so hot and so sweet.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it.” Rio sat up, gathered her hair, and tied it up messily with the hair tie she had on her wrist. “You’re getting head.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that a threat?” She snorted, sitting up too and working to undo the harness before Rio stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh uh.” Rio tutted as she settled between Agatha’s thighs and took the strap, still covered in her own cum, into her mouth and moaning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, god.” Agatha groaned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and took the strap further into her mouth, her hand coming underneath the harness to tease. She swiped two fingers through Agatha’s cunt, feeling how wet she had gotten from fucking Rio. She sinks her fingers inside, causing Agatha to jerk her hips, and the strap to hit the back of Rio’s throat. She gags, but quickly recovers, pumping her fingers and curling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, sorr-” Agatha tries apologizing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looks her dead in the eyes, grabs Agatha’s hand and places it on the back of her own head. She speeds up her fingers as she relaxes her throat and takes the entire length in her mouth, looking up at Agatha and batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flushes, her chest is red, and Rio swears she can feel her get wetter as she continues simultaneously fingering and deepthroating Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha cries out as Rio adds another finger and grinds her palm down on Agatha’s clit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhhhhh.” Is the only thing Rio can respond with, head still bobbing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand claws into Rio’s scalp and her walls clench as those perfect fingers rub her just right.
    </p>
<p>
     “Faster, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio automatically complies, speeding her digits, hitting that spongy part inside of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, fuck, f-” Agatha yells as she finally comes, thighs shuddering around Rio’s head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slides the strap out of her mouth and undoes the harness, adding it to the piles of clothing on the floor. Crawling up Agatha’s body, she finally licks those abs before kissing up the rest of Agatha’s torso.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looks a little drunk as she smiles at Rio. “I like you so much.” She softly admits.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gives her a kiss before responding. “That’s good, because I don’t just suck any hot woman’s cock. I’m a lady.” She grins.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...” Agatha rolls her eyes, prompting her for the correct response.
    </p>
<p>
     “You said you missed my smart-ass remarks!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.” Agatha insists.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like you too, so much.” She presses another kiss to Agatha’s lips, she’d be content to never kiss another pair after today. “Like a concerning amount.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like concerning to the point that you’d let me take you out on a real date?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was just doing very vulgar things to Agatha, and yet this somehow felt more intimate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Agatha, I’ll go on a date with you.” Rio beamed and pulled Agatha in again, feeling the other woman smile and melt against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank god. It would’ve been very awkward if you had said no.” Agatha deadpanned.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     After several more hours tangled in bed together, Agatha detaches Rio from between her legs and demands that they eat. To which Rio makes the argument that she was eating. Agatha scoffs and offers to order food, they both land on chinese and Agatha gives Rio some sweatpants and that Columbia sweater to wear. She wanted to protest wearing the same sweater, but damn, it was cozy. An hour later, the food arrives and Agatha throws on a robe to go collect their late lunch or extremely early dinner from the porch.
    </p>
<p>
     While alone, Rio’s attention zeroes in on a stack of papers and a notebook sandwiched between a laptop on Agatha’s nightstand. She shouldn’t snoop, but fucking sue her, her curiosity is piqued. When she opens the laptop, the screen loads a website advertising apartments for rent.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha owns this place, why is she looking for an apartment in Chicago? And why was her only requirement a rooftop garden? That’s what was filled out in the little search filter at the top of the webpage at least.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio looks down at the notebook, it’s filled with addresses. Some crossed off, some left alone. The fuck?
    </p>
<p>
     She hears Agatha waltz back in, brown paper bag in hand. “I thought about plates, but I’m not fucking doing dish-” Agatha announced before registering what Rio was looking at.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you selling your place?” Rio furrowed her brows.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you apartment hunting, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not.” She set down the food, and sat on the bed next to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well then, why-”
    </p>
<p>
     “You grew them yourself.” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?” Rio was trying to keep up.
    </p>
<p>
     “The flowers. The bouquet you brought me that night at my office. You grew them yourself, and I didn’t see any flowers in your office. Just plants.” Agatha gave a nervous smile. “So I knew wherever you grew them, is where you lived. And since Jen wouldn’t get me your address from Alice…” She shot Rio a pointed look. “I started looking at condos and apartments in the city that have either a rooftop garden or a greenhouse.” She blew out a deep breath. “Some I crossed off because they were too far from the practice, or they were basically just a gray minimalist box, which I could never see you living in.” She continues, "And I did not think there’d be as many as there are, seriously-”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Kissed the woman who was trying to find her in a city of almost three million people using very little, very Rio-specific information.
    </p>
<p>
     A needle in a fucking haystack.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t kiss me every time you want me to stop speaking.” Agatha mumbled into her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so creepy for that.” Now Rio really was swooning.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you, you were hard to stalk.”

     Chapter 14
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s idea of agreeing to a date with Agatha happened to be Rio picking the day, the time, and the place. She had planned the whole night before Agatha could get a word in otherwise. When Agatha had asked, she assumed that she’d handle the details, she always did. In her job and every past relationship, she leads. She led a whole department at work, she led the plans and decisions in her marriage, she led in the bedroom. But Rio? Rio didn’t even think twice before taking the lead.
    </p>
<p>
     The date in question, took place the Friday after their…spirited reunion. It also just so happened to be the day she had finished all the legal paperwork and was officially a free woman. The divorce negotiations were easy enough, Wanda got the house that Agatha had made perfectly clear she despised. Agatha kept her townhouse in the city. Wanda refused spousal support, claiming the gallery was paying her more than enough to be comfortable. Agatha didn’t argue with that.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda tried to give her engagement ring back, but Agatha didn’t want it. It was meant for Wanda, whether they were together or not, it was always Wanda’s. As for their wedding bands? Yeah those got pawned, neither of them wanted a memento of their failed marriage while being with new people. And Agatha was so ready to be with Rio, for nothing to hold her back anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had collected the last of her things from their once shared home a couple days ago. It wasn’t a lengthy process considering they had been living separately for over two weeks at this point. She boxed up the last of her clothes, books, and a few pieces of art that she actually liked. She had thrown everything in her car and turned to Wanda who was standing in the driveway, her face and body language tense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, that’s it.” Agatha declared.
    </p>
<p>
     “End of an era.” Wanda responded quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “To be fair, it was a really shitty era.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe. Still over.” Wanda’s voice was strained.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at the keys in her hand. “Oh, I should-” She started working the house key off the ring. “I should give you this.” Handing the key out to her ex-wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked down at the piece of metal in Agatha’s hand before moving her gaze back up. “You know what? Keep it. You never know…” She trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would I need a key to a place I no longer live?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, it just feels weird to take it from you.” Wanda huffed. “Just keep it.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha couldn’t fight, didn’t want to, she just slid the key back on the damn keyring and nodded. “Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s going to be even weirder not seeing you everyday.” But it didn’t sound like flirting or even reminiscing, it sounded like loss. “Or not even knowing when the next time I’ll see you will be.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you want to see me, you can just ask.” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’d want to see me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re lesbians, I think it’d be weirder if we never saw one another again.” She snorted. “Yes, Wanda, if you asked, I would want to see you.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was the truth. Their relationship had healed so prominently in the short span of time, Agatha actually remembered why they got along in the first place. They were good as friends, or as friendly as ex-spouses can be.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about a double date?” Wanda pounced with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ehhh. I don’t think Nat’s my biggest fan, and Rio definitely isn’t yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? I’m the reason you two are back together!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, the ink is barely dry. Give the woman some time, yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Wanda a gentle touch on her shoulder before leaving what was technically her home of the last five years. But it didn’t feel like she was leaving home, it felt like she was driving to it. To the city, to the townhouse, and to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Which is how she finds herself now standing in her bedroom on a Friday night, pacing around with Jen on facetime and struggling to find something to wear.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two have banged, like, a billion times. Why are you stressing over this now?” Jen said from her little rectangular prison inside Agatha’s phone that was propped up on her dresser as she rummaged through her closet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because, Jennifer,” She emphasized her full name. “I haven’t been on a date in five years. I haven’t had to do the annoying surface level conversation in five years. I haven’t been nervous to go out with someone in five years. And I’m starting to think all I can offer another person is sex.” Agatha was ranting as she slipped on a dress and walked out of the closet to show Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay first of all, not a bad thing to offer someone. Second, you’re dumb, because Rio can’t stop yapping Alice’s ear off about how she likes you. It’s like we’re in high school and she wants you to wear her fucking varsity jacket.” Jen then looked Agatha up and down. “And third, I don’t like it.” Referring to the dress Agatha was currently wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wore this to work last week.” Agatha defended her pick, she knew Rio liked her academic aesthetic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I didn’t like it then either.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bold move criticizing my style when yours is basically just Elle Woods if she stayed at Harvard and became a professor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t hear an insult in there.” Jen unhelpfully replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine! Please tell me, Kale, what do I wear to see Rio, who will be here in the next ten minutes?”
    </p>
<p>
     They settle on a lacy burgundy blouse that’s semi-see through, nothing scandalous, just teasing. She pairs it with black jeans, heeled boots, and a black peacoat. The outfit is versatile enough for wherever Rio could possibly take her.
    </p>
<p>
     She hangs up with Jen and waits for a text from Rio telling her she’s here, until she hears a knock at her door.
    </p>
<p>
     She yanks open her front door and there is Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio holding yet another homemade bouquet wrapped up in twine.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiling with her hair down and wavy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio in a black dress, heels, and a leather blazer.
    </p>
<p>
     Thank god for an early spring.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look beautiful.” Agatha says, almost to herself, as she gawks at the woman on her porch.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was going to say the same thing about you.” Rio responds as she extends her arm, handing over the bouquet.
    </p>
<p>
     “How chivalrous.” Agatha quips, smelling the flowers. “Azaleas?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What can I say? I’m a gentleman.” Rio says as she takes a few steps into the foyer and presses an earnest kiss to Agatha’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     The fleeting physical contact makes Agatha blush more than a grown woman should. “I’ll throw these in some water, and we can head out.”
    </p>
<p>
     When they reach the curb where Rio’s car is parked, she is left aghast as Rio’s hand bolts out to open the passenger side door for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “M’lady.” Rio parrots as she smiles, waiting for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Normally, Agatha would try and find a way to minimize this. Make light of the fact that she authentically found Rio’s effort to be sweet. Give Rio shit for trying to court her. But she can’t with how warm and fuzzy her chest feels. “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     As they drive, Agatha recognizes the music playing throughout the car and chuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a relationship therapist who listens to Lana Del Rey?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asks in mock offense, sliding her hand across the console to rest on Agatha’s thigh as she drives. Oh fuck her, Agatha had pulled that same move a thousand times with past dates.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just kind of a red flag, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Using that logic, Alice can’t listen to any band almost ever as an addiction therapist. And she loves Fleetwood Mac.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted. “What, and Lilia just loooves Blue Oyster Cult?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please Don’t Fear The Reaper would definitely be a choice to blast during her sessions.” Rio quips and steals a quick glance towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you think Smiths fans are insufferable, I raise you her fans.” Agatha then points at the touch screen display showing the Lana album playing.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can be insufferable together, then.” Rio easily reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     Together.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d like to be together with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Were they together? They hadn’t talked about what they were, and this was technically their first date.
    </p>
<p>
     A few more minutes pass and Rio parks, it’s some restaurant on the west side. Nice but not fancy, charming as they walk in. Low lighting and an intimate atmosphere. They’re seated in a cozy corner booth that Agatha thinks Rio must’ve requested since it’s definitely big enough for more than two people and the place is fairly bustling on a Friday night.
    </p>
<p>
     They slide in, and Rio leaves no space between the two of them as she shakes off her jacket. Her dress is sleeveless and even though Agatha has seen her arms before, something about the way Rio’s biceps subtly flex catches her eye. Agatha takes her jacket off too and doesn’t miss the way Rio looks at her, appraising her body through the lace of her shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     They order, and as they wait, Agatha becomes too aware that she’ll have to start a conversation. Maybe it’s dumb, but she wants answers to those stupid fucking surface level questions.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s your favorite color?” She blurts.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Goddamnit, you are horrible at this.’ She quickly scolds herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio doesn’t seem to mind, just smiles. “Green.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that checks out.” Agatha answers and takes a sip of her wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is yours purple?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How, how’d you know that?” Agatha had never said that it was to Rio, they barely knew anything about the other.
    </p>
<p>
     “The amount of purple in your house or on your person day to day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You notice that kind of stuff?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When I like somebody, yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     And it’s stupid. It’s so, so stupid, but Rio noticing things about her and saying she likes her makes Agatha smile.
    </p>
<p>
     So, they continue with the boring ‘get to know you’ chitchat. Only, it’s shockingly not boring. Agatha learns that Rio’s middle name is Marie, because of course it is. She learns Rio is an only child, raised in Michigan, and moved to Chicago for med school at Loyola.
    </p>
<p>
     “I loved the city enough that I just stayed. Lilia offered me a job at the practice, and that was that.” Rio finished.
    </p>
<p>
     “So why’d you choose marital therapy?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugs. “Honestly? It’s entertaining. You don’t just get one mind to analyze, but two. You have to figure out how they react with one another, what triggers the other. How the two can work in tandem, long-term. It’s fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinks at that reasoning. “So my brain was fun for you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your brain is always fun to me.” Rio grins. “Your head too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Smart-ass.” But Agatha is smiling as they talk and eat.
    </p>
<p>
     It feels good, it feels almost easy.
    </p>
<p>
     “But what about you? Why’d you become an English professor?” Rio raises an inquisitive eyebrow and places her hand on Agtha’s wrist, gently gliding her thumb back and forth over the pulsepoint.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, no surprise to you, but I grew up in a house where the only form of literature available was the bible. Old testament, not new.” Agatha says and assumes that’s all she has to contribute, but Rio is staring at her with huge amber eyes, waiting for more. “So, when I finally got out and went to college, which mind you my mother did not approve of.” Agatha lets out a bitter chuckle. “I read everything, it was like I finally understood what my mother felt when she read scripture. The emotion and the meaning, just everything. I’d read these great classics and I felt, I don’t know, challenged, intrigued, or seen. I wanted more so I just kept going for another degree. Eventually I found a teaching job and-” Oh, Agtha was rambling, she was rambling about really pretentious bullshit that nobody other than her cared about. “Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Why are you apologizing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just went on a tangent to a very simple question.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you were talking. And I was interested and would like to hear more, so please…” Rio waved her hand to prompt Agatha to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you not get tired of listening to people talk at you all day?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not talking at me, I’m learning about how fascinating you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, Rio had made her blush for the second time that night.
    </p>
<p>
     They talk through the rest of dinner and finish their meal. They make their way back to the car, at which, Rio opens Agtha’s door for her again. She also makes it a point to help Agatha out of the car when they reach the townhouse, keeping her hand in Agatha’s and walking her to the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel like if I kiss you, my dad’s gonna turn on the porch light to break us up.” Agatha jokes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I just haven’t been out on a date like this in years, feels very reminiscent of high school, with the gentlemanly wooing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You deserve to be wooed.” Rio’s tone is soft, and her eyes flicker to Agatha's lips. The kiss is sweet, it's gentle, it’s everything that their kisses haven’t been up until now. Rio slides a hand around Agatha’s waist and pulls her in, kissing her like she has all the time in the world. Completely unhurried.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulls back, she rests her other hand on Agatha's cheek and smiles. “How about this for high school?” Rio looks at Agatha, really looks at her so Agatha knows she is not entirely joking. “Agatha, would you wanna be my girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     Ugh, it is so high school, it almost wants to make Agatha keel over and die of embarrassment.
    </p>
<p>
     Embarrassment that she really wants this, that she’s smiling so wide her face hurts, that her stomach feels all warm and fluttery.
    </p>
<p>
     But they’ve only known each other a month, so she can’t say that she’s been dying to officially be something, anything with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Only if we can do freaky shit behind the bleachers.” Is what Agatha ends up going with instead of anything sappy things she’s thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughs and drops her hand so both are entwined around Agatha’s waist, pulling her in for another kiss before murmuring against Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, I would expect nothing less.”

     Epilogue
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost two years into their relationship when Rio proposed, on one knee, on a sappy cliff outside the city that overlooked Lake Michigan. The ring had one of those stupid salt and pepper diamonds that Agatha loved but Jen said looked like dirt trapped in the stone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t said anything to Rio about rings, how’d she-
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking Jen, that sneaky bitch, told Rio what kind of ring to get. Only the band was gold. It was a delicate band, but gold? All of Agatha’s jewelry was gold, yes, but her last ring had been silver.
    </p>
<p>
     Not that she was comparing her former simple wedding band to this fucking glorious engagement ring, however it made her scrunch her face in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s exactly the reaction I was going for.” Rio deadpanned, still looking up at Agatha from her one knee on the ground, waiting for an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “The band is gold.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Astute observation.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “All of your jewelry is gold, you own not one single piece of silver-” Rio took a deep breath. “Do you not like that the band is gold?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I love it!” Agatha did love it, she couldn’t have dreamt up a better ring for herself if she had tried.
    </p>
<p>
     But even after years with Rio, it still made her feel too much whenever the other woman noticed things that Agatha didn’t have to explicitly say. When they were dating, Rio had noticed that Agatha would only drink dry wines, from then on that’s all Rio kept at her place. Agatha didn’t need to tell Rio, she just caught on. Same thing when Rio moved into the townhouse and observed that Agatha would throw her keys literally anywhere when she got home, and then have a meltdown trying to find them the next morning when she’d try to leave for work. Rio very quickly and without saying a word, mounted a few key hooks on the wall in the foyer. That was also the first time Agatha saw Rio in a tank top flexing her arms with an electric drill, and finally understood the appeal of taking the strap. Which she did that night, several times.
    </p>
<p>
     And now, the gold band.
    </p>
<p>
     Which, honestly? Fuck Rio. She had pulled out a little plush box before Agatha could even reach for the one currently burning a hole in her own pocket.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was never afraid to take the lead.
    </p>
<p>
     Or ya know, steal it right out from under Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     All this to say, Agatha wasn’t meaning to keep Rio waiting in suspense for an answer to her proposal, she just never got used to somebody knowing her so well. Fuck, she had to answer, Rio was starting to look like a kicked puppy with how long she’d been waiting with one knee digging into the rock beneath them.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, uh…?” Rio’s voice wavered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love, I’ll marry you.” Agatha breathed out, smiling like a fucking fool as Rio slid the ring onto her left hand. Rio jumped up and grabbed Agatha’s face to pull her in for a kiss, but Agatha quickly dodged it and pulled out her own velvet box. Her hands shook with anxiety, which is dumb because Rio obviously wanted to marry her, she had just asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not getting down on one knee on this cliff because I’m forty-fucking-seven and I will feel it in my joints for the next week.” Rio’s eyes widened as she realized what was happening. “But,” Agatha already had tears welling from accepting Rio’s proposal, and she was struggling to get a word out. She opened the box, revealing a marquise cut emerald, the band was gold with little engraved vines. “Rio Vidal, will-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Rio interrupted and subsequently grabbed Agatha again. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     The ring wasn’t even on Rio’s finger yet and she could feel her fiancee’s tears against her face as they kissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you.” Agatha mumbled between kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio angled to deepen the kiss, poking out her tongue and brushing it over Agatha’s top lip, causing them both to let out a satisfied groan. Agatha nestled a hand in Rio’s hair before remembering that she now had a ring on that hand and her fiancee did not.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, wait, wait.” Agatha murmured, to which Rio whined. She grinned at her antics, plucked the ring from the box, and grabbed Rio’s left hand before slipping the ring on.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s perfect, I love it.” Rio quietly said and stared down at her hand, flexing and wiggling her fingers, like she was adjusting to the new weight. The stone wasn’t huge, Agatha knew Rio would never want something that flashy, but it was more than tasteful in its size.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I figured, you only get married twice, right?” Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up from her hand, narrowed her eyes at Agatha, and tucked her tongue against her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna throw you off this cliff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Yeah, to nobody’s surprise, she didn’t actually follow through on that threat. However, it didn’t stop her from making another as they celebrated their engagement that night.
    </p>
<p>
     They were in bed and had been for a while at that point. Rio was wearing the strap and Agatha was riding while her newly adorned left hand squeezed her fiancee’s throat. In the throes of passion, Agatha had declared something along the lines of “I was so fucking stupid not to wait for you.” Or something like that, but who’s to say, really? Nobody could prove she had said that in a court of law.
    </p>
<p>
     To which Rio, who up until that point was perfectly content being used by Agatha, braced her hands on Agatha’s hips and flipped them so she was now on top.
    </p>
<p>
     That was new, not the strap, but the power shift. Agatha had said something that lit a fire in Rio, so much so, that her fiancee immediately began a punishing rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
     She had already been so close to the finish line, but Rio’s jealousy was about to bring her home.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was that?” Rio asked, but she clearly already understood what Agatha had meant.
    </p>
<p>
     Fine, Agatha would play along, she wanted to see where this would go.
    </p>
<p>
     “I should’ve- fuck!” Her back arched as Rio pulled out slowly before slamming back in. “I should’ve waited for you. I was a coward to not wait for you. You should’ve always been my first wife, my only wife.” Agatha finished through heavy breaths.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave an evil smile before snapping her hips faster. “Aw baby, you wouldn’t have wanted me to be your first wife.” She then grabbed Agatha’s right wrist and pinned it to the mattress before lacing her fingers with Agatha’s left hand and pinning it to the bed too.  “Because if you had cheated on me, I would’ve fucking killed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Threatening murder twice in one day?
    </p>
<p>
     She was a mental health professional, the freak.
    </p>
<p>
     Yeah, Agatha could get on board with this.
    </p>
<p>
     She let out an ungodly moan and clenched around the strap that Rio was making sure fully sheathed inside Agatha on every fucking thrust.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah? How?” Agatha taunted.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, the way Rio was gripping Agatha’s wrist was definitely going to bruise, but in a very sick way, Agatha couldn’t wait to see end result. She knew if she wanted her wrist back she could just ask Rio and she’d let up, but Agatha simply didn’t want her to, not when she was this close and her soon-to-be wife was plotting her demise.
    </p>
<p>
     The look in Rio’s eyes as she proceeded sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. “Grow some oleander or maybe plant some hemlock, crush it up and sneak it in your dinner or your morning coffee.” She dropped her head to whisper directly into Agatha’s ear, increasing her pace with the strap. “Make you have a seizure or go into cardiac arrest, I look like the innocent grieving widow,” Agatha’s hips were rolling to frantically meet Rio everytime she pushed in.  She was whimpering and felt herself leaking around Rio’s cock. “And no one’s the wiser.”
    </p>
<p>
     Fucking hell, that did it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha most definitely fucked up her vocal chords with how loudly she screamed as she came. Her whole body shuddered violently as the waves crashed over and over again. Her neck felt like it could’ve snapped off as she threw her head back in ecstasy, Rio hastily placed kisses across the column of her throat. She couldn’t really feel her legs, but she did feel a wet sensation on her upper thighs and against Rio’s harness.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down and-
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to have a field day with this.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you just-” Agatha quickly covered Rio’s mouth to muffle the word she very much did not want to hear before dropping her hand back down. “After I told you my plan to murder you?” Her fiancee raised an eyebrow and smirked as she asked the very obvious rhetorical question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucking sue me.” Agatha rasped out with Rio still actively inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a fucking god is what you’re saying. I’m-”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you keep talking about it, I’m breaking off our engagement.” Agatha mock threatened, rolling her hips again and moaning. “C’mon, baby, fuck me like you hate me, again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so unhinged, I fucking love you.” Rio softly replied, looking down at Agatha with those gigantic brown eyes filled to the brim with undying love and devotion.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha threw her hands around Rio’s back and encouraged her as Rio began again. “Oh fuck, I love you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     They had been engaged for two weeks and they were in a stalemate. Seeing as it was Agatha’s second marriage, she wanted to keep the wedding fairly understated, leaning towards elopement. She had done the whole wedding thing before and it did not promise the happy ending she thought it would. Rio felt the opposite, she’d never been married before, she was insistent that she would only be married once in her life. Which, okay, no need to brag. She claimed she wanted to show everyone important to them how in love she was with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m team Rio, I wanna be the maid of honor!” Jen exclaimed at the celebratory engagement brunch that only consisted of the four of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice were sitting at the table, joined at the hip, across from Rio and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bold of you to assume you’d be my maid of honor.” Agatha retorted, knocking back the last of her mimosa.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bitch, name one other friend you have.” Jen shot back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m starting to regret having you as a friend.” Agatha muttered under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing, Jennifer, I’ll happily make you my bitch for several months of planning and organizing. Can’t wait!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You guys are so mean to each other.” Alice chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let ‘em get it out of their system, makes them nicer to us.” Rio stage whispered to Alice across the table.
    </p>
<p>
     That was a fucking mistake, because now both Jen and Agatha were both shooting a death glare at their respective partner.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t say it, why am I in trouble?” Alice defended to her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great point, babe.” Jen agreed and shifted her eye daggers to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re both literally proving my point.” Rio said before turning her body to look at Agatha. “Plus, I like it when you’re mean, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, Agatha melted and smiled. “Fine, but I’m still not on board with a big wedding, no matter how much you flatter me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How is that flattery?” Jen judged.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about a micro-wedding? Fifty people or less?” Rio ignored the peanut gallery and focused only on Agatha. Her eyes were just two huge pools of honey as she hopefully awaited her fiancee’s answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “I suppose, it wouldn’t kill me.” Agatha compromised.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face lit up as she leaned in to kiss Agatha, probably a little too passionately for a public place. Normally, Agatha wasn’t super into PDA, but who was she to stop her ridiculously hot fiancee from trying to eat her face off?
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, wrap it up, lovebirds.” Alice scolded with snapping her fingers to break the two apart from each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guys, c’mon we’re eating!” Jen said at the same time as her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turns out, micro-weddings were cheaper, easier, and less time consuming than standard ones. Making it perfect to have their wedding on the second day in June. Honestly, it was more practical than romantic, Agatha was done with school for the year, and it was Saturday, meaning Rio didn’t have work. That being said, Chicago traffic during pride month was a nightmare. Agatha had grown a lot in her opinion of the community while being with Rio, but Jesus Christ, it was too humid out to see that many gay men in assless leather chaps.
    </p>
<p>
     To be fair, she was cranky, it was the first morning in recent memory where she hadn’t woken up with her face nuzzled in Rio’s neck. Her lovely wife-to-be had insisted on not seeing one another before the ceremony on the day of the wedding, meaning Rio slept at Alice and Jen’s last night, and Agatha had barely slept at all.
    </p>
<p>
     Once at the venue, Agatha changed into her suit. She had worn a dress at her first wedding and loathed having to deal with all that extra fabric all night, so second time around? Yeah, she’s wearing fucking pants. It was a crisp white double breasted blazer with very well fitted trousers that made her ass look amazing. Additionally, she decided to forgo wearing anything underneath her suit jacket, making the ‘V’ of the blazer expose most of her sternum. Now, if that drove her almost-wife absolutely feral? That wasn’t Agatha’s fault.
    </p>
<p>
     She walked out into the bridal suite where Jen and Wanda congregated, giggling and drinking champagne.
    </p>
<p>
     “Check. Me. Out.” Agatha announced, prompting the women to turn around.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of them whipped around, jaws dropping at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, you look amazing.” Wanda gasped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Enjoy this, because it’s the only time I’ll say it: Fucking hell, you look hot.” Jen conceded. “Almost makes me forgive you for not making me your maid of honor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We didn’t do bridal parties, there’s no maids of anything.” Agatha reminded her as she clipped her watch around her wrist and found her earrings.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re trying to ruin my special day!” Jen deadpanned.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just watched the back and forth, laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Wait, why was Wanda in her bridal suite? Rio had Alice in hers, Agatha was supposed to have only Jen, and Wanda was supposed to be with Nat and all the other guests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhh?” The redhead grunted through her champagne flute.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Agatha saw Wanda and Nat enough that it only made sense to invite them to the wedding. Rio and Agatha had been invited to theirs a little less than a year ago. Most lesbian social circles had exes, theirs was no exception.
    </p>
<p>
     Well except for the whole doctor/patient infidelity thing, but back to the question at hand:
    </p>
<p>
     Why was Wanda here?
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing. Just wanted to show my support for you and Rio.” Wanda smiled and downed her champagne before picking up another and almost chugging it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened at the realization, she gasped and pointed her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you hiding from your pregnant wife, right now? With your ex-wife?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dude.” Jen sideyed Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “She won’t let me drink because she can’t drink. I have not had alcohol in five months! Let me live, okay?” Wanda rushed out and gulped down another swig.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you think would happen if you had gotten pregnant? That would’ve been nine months plus breastfeeding with no booze.” Agatha fiddled with her engagement ring.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Nat wants to breastfeed.” Wanda moved onto her third glass in under ten minutes. “Oh god, I’m never gonna drink again, am I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not until those little goblins are out of the house.” Jen mutters over her own glass.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, back to me.” Agatha announced as she raised her champagne. Wanda and Jen raised theirs in response. “To me and my super fucking intelligent, sexy, funny, kick-ass, drop-dead gorgeous fiancee.” They all clinked their glasses and drank, lounging until Alice knocked on the door, giving the green light for them to make their way downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     They were getting married at this industrial half warehouse thing that Rio loved. It had an indoor venue that was basically a huge gray cinder block cell, but they were getting married at the outdoor venue in the courtyard. It had vines and ivy all over the exposed brick, fountains throughout, and moss covering the original cobblestone on the ground. Of course Rio had died when they had toured it a couple months ago, basically begging to book it. Agatha agreed, she didn’t care where she was marrying Rio, just as long as she was marrying Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heels clicked across the concrete ground as she made her way down to the ground floor, she was walking as fast as she could without spraining an ankle. She wanted to see Rio, see her dress. It was the only wedding tradition Rio cared about, refusing to let Agatha see her dress after she had bought it. Well that, and Agatha not being permitted to see Rio all day.
    </p>
<p>
     As she turned the corner she was finally, finally, met with the sight she had been yearning for all day. Rio waited in front of the set of french double doors that led into the courtyard, the sun casting through this heavenly glow on her. Agatha felt her heart stutter and her jaw drop as she roamed her gaze over her almost-wife. Rio’s dress was slinky and made of silk or maybe satin. It clung effortlessly to the curves of her body with a high neckline that resulted in a halter top that tied around her neck. The excess fabric created a bow that sat on the base of her neck, the tails of said bow left to sit against the exposed skin of her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio beamed as she locked her eyes on Agatha. “Hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You look…” Agatha couldn’t get the words out, too mesmerized by the ethereal beauty in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you too.” Rio quietly admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re…”
    </p>
<p>
     Brain. Think. Verbalize.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio softly intertwined her hands in Agatha’s and simply smiled. “So you like the dress, then?” Rio’s voice dripped in sarcasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “My love, scrap the oleander, I’m fairly certain you’ve already achieved your goal of inducing cardiac arrest.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t die yet, I won’t get any of your money without a signed marriage license.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, my apologies, how inconsiderate of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, what’s inconsiderate, is this damn suit.” Rio grumbled, hands now gripping the lapels of the blazer. “I’d rip it off if I wasn’t so sure you had spent a small fortune on it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How dare you, I’m almost a married woman.” Agatha faked outrage and smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a soft chuckle. “You ready?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was ready to marry you after our first date.” Agatha earnestly responds.
    </p>
<p>
     They had decided during the planning of the wedding that they’d walk down the aisle together. Agatha’s father was dead, and Rio had never met hers. Additionally, Agatha’s mother was an evil cunt as well as six feet under, and Rio’s mom had passed years ago, although she was apparently a very sweet woman. Agatha hid her envy when she learned that Rio had an accepting and loving mother; she couldn’t imagine what that must’ve been like. Leaving the only solution to be the both of them walking down with one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia stood at the altar waiting to officiate, she was a surrogate mother-figure to Rio and the only person they had considered to marry them. When Rio had first told Lilia that they were dating, Lilia seemed hesitant to show her support.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, very understandable.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt guilty for months about having to lie to Lilia that she had ‘reconnected with Agatha months after the divorce’ which yes, was technically not the truth, but it was a fib that let Rio keep her job. Eventually, Lilia came around after seeing how happy Rio was with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     After the ceremony, there was a cocktail hour that Agatha and Rio had not even seen a single minute of, opting instead to race back to Agatha’s bridal suite.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, the reception starts in five minutes.” Rio panted with her back slumped against the wall, and her wife’s head tucked underneath her gown, still licking after numerous orgasms.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back and let the fabric drop back down, revealing her glistening face and disheveled hair. “How the hell are you keeping track of time right now?” She looked up at her wife from where she was kneeling, fuck her knees were going to feel that later.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrist from where it was gripping her hip and raised it for her wife to see. “You have a watch on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “See? That’s why I married a doctor, those critical thinking skills are off the charts.” Standing up and giving Rio a kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are…also a doctor.” Rio informed her like Agatha wasn’t aware of her own education.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does that mean I’d be Dr. Doctor Harkness-Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mi vida, our reception?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right!” Agatha quickly wiped her wife’s cum off her face, fixed her hair, and grabbed Rio to make their way to the reception.
    </p>
<p>
     Her attempts at making herself look innocent were all for naught, as they were immediately clocked by their wonderful, loving friends.
    </p>
<p>
     “You couldn’t wait a few hours?” Alice asked as the couple approached their table.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bent down to respond to Alice, who was sitting with Jen, Nat, Wanda, and Lilia. “Didn’t you and Jen fuck in the reception hall bathroom at your wedding?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice turned beet red and cleared her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Atta-girl, Jen.” Agatha winked over Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t involve me in this.” Jen gritted out.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the night went on without a hitch, the food was good, the bar was open, and damn Rio’s family could drink. There were only a handful in attendance due to the limited guest list and the majority of them not living in the states, but the ones that were there made the most of it.
    </p>
<p>
     After talking to who Agatha was pretty sure was Rio’s thousandth tía, she started to crack. “Okay that was the third one of your family members to ask or imply that I’m the man because I’m in a suit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re trying.” Rio supplied as they swayed on the dancefloor. “Plus, it doesn’t help that you’re leading right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed softly and pulled her wife in closer. “I’m sorry more of them couldn’t be here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay.” Rio dismissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not. Just because I hate my family doesn’t mean everyone does.” Agatha raised her eyebrows hopefully. “So, I was thinking…maybe we go to Puerto Rico for our honeymoon? Fly out for a few weeks, spend half the time with family and the other half fucking in the ocean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought you wanted to go to Europe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We can go to Europe whenever.” Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, mi amor.” Rio whispered and purposefully rolled the ‘R’ knowing her wife had an affinity for it, seeing as Agatha was shit at it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome, but if you do that again, I’m going to have to take you on this dancefloor right here, right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     And that is how Agatha found herself in Puerto Rico in fucking July. She was already pre-menopausal and the summer heat in San Juan was going to be the death of her. She tried to put on a brave front for her wife, she really did, but seeing as she was a  white midwestern woman in her late 40’s, Rio was not surprised when Agatha had a breakdown on day five of the trip.
    </p>
<p>
     “WHY DOES THIS AC NEVER GET COLD ENOUGH?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was in the kitchen of their AirB&amp;B. Multiple of Rio’s family members had offered to host the couple, but it was their honeymoon afterall. She stopped her cooking and made her way to the living area of what was essentially a villa that Agatha had picked out. Not that Rio was complaining.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ya know most places around here don’t even have AC.” Rio said as her wife bashed her hand at the thermostat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whipped her head to look at Rio, and she looked fucking miserable. She was sweating and shaking a little, from the rage or the hot flash? Who knows.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to go drown myself in the pool, don’t save me.” She ripped her cover-up off and flung it at her wife, leaving her in an admittedly pretty skimpy two piece as she made her way outside of the villa and dove into the pool.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold up!” Rio’s voice followed. “Don’t you think you require a life-guard?” She could hear the fucking smirk on her wife’s face as she plunged into the water. When she resurfaced, she looked up to find Rio, standing at the edge of the pool. She ripped off her shorts and t-shirt, revealing her own bikini, before joining Agatha in the pool.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said don’t save me.” Agatha pouted and threw her arms around Rio’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what kind of wife would that make me?” Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha, kissed her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “A merciful one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave that toothy smile that she always does. ”I wish she could’ve met you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha doesn’t have to ask who she means, but Agatha wishes the same. She wishes she could meet the woman who gave her the person who she loves most in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     “You think she’d like me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She would have loved you.” Rio simply says, like it's obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mother would’ve hated you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never met the bitch and I hate her, at least we’d have something in common.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cackles and splashes a handful of water at Rio before clinging to her again.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of their honeymoon is more or less the same, Rio’s family seems to like Agatha enough. Their only qualm isn’t the lesbianism, just that Agatha didn’t speak fluent Spanish. To which Agatha defends she’s learning, making it a point to show her 121 day Duolingo streak. That doesn’t seem to impress them, however her wife looks proud as Agatha proceeds to speak the most broken Spanish Rio has ever heard in her forty-two years of life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reaches over where they sit at the dinner table with her family and locks her hand with Agatha’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te quiero.” She whispers under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looks at her with so much admiration and a little relief.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te quiero.” Again, it’s broken, but Agatha tries.
    </p>
<p>
     When they get back to Chicago, Rio is informed by Alice that two of her plants in the backyard didn’t make it. Her wife looks physically pained but tells Alice that she’s sure she tried her best. Yeah, Agatha can tell Rio is dying a little inside.
    </p>
<p>
     But life goes on, it goes on, and Agatha has Rio by her side for all of it. She has Rio when Wanda and Nat have their twins, through promotions, and bad days. Through the occasional jealousy that Rio displays about Agatha working with twenty somethings. There had been an incident where a grad student in a short skirt rounded Agatha’s desk at the same time Rio decided to surprise her wife with lunch. Nothing had happened with said grad student, but like Agatha told Rio, lesbains and their mommy issues. It was actually resolved in a very diplomatic way, by Rio riding her face until she nearly passed out, and Agatha printing and framing numerous of their wedding photos and placing them around her office.
    </p>
<p>
     Call it serendipity, but Rio chose that exact moment to waltz into her home office on Saturday morning in a long green sundress. Agatha had more work responsibilities now that she was the dean of the liberal arts college of Columbia; she now oversaw every department under that umbrella, not just hers. Even though it was summer, she didn’t get a break, she should’ve thought about that before accepting the position two years ago.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, I told you, I have to get through all of this.” Agatha muttered and looked back to her computer screen over the brim of her glasses. She could tell exactly what her wife wanted as soon as she walked through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m sorry professor Harkness-Vidal, I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to get my grade up.” Rio’s inflection was breathy, goading even.
    </p>
<p>
     Fine, she was only human, and her wife was hot.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know Ms. Harkness-Vidal, I might have some extra credit in mind.” Agatha drawled back, entertaining the roleplay.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s Dr. Harkness-Vidal.” Rio corrected.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, in this made up sex fantasy, you’re still a doctor and yet you’re failing a graduate level English course?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, well now you’ve broken the allure.” Rio joked as she rounded Agatha’s desk and sat on top of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know they’re gonna be here soon.” Agatha reminded as she slid her hands under the skirt of Rio’s dress.
    </p>
<p>
     “So be quick.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slipped off the glasses she knew made her wife crazy before bunching up the rest of the fabric and dipping her tongue against Rio’s unclothed cunt. Of course she wasn’t wearing any underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s back arched and she let out a moan. It was a moan Agatha had heard before over the last four years, but she’d never get sick of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had just made Rio come and was going for a second when the doorbell rang, causing Agatha to pull away. Rio whined in protest but hopped off the desk and let her dress fall back down.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll go put on underwear.” Rio solemnly stated and kissed Agatha before leaving the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly ran to the bathroom and wiped her face of Rio’s evidence before making her way down the stairs to the front door, where the bell rang again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m coming!” Agatha shouted and wretched open the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately two three-year olds barreled in, in unison shouting. “Aunt Aggie!”
    </p>
<p>
     She’d never forgive Wanda for supplying her children with that nickname.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry we’re early, but Nat’s with a client and I have to oversee a delivery at the gallery, and they called me in saying they need me there sooner.” Wanda apologized, walking in and setting down a bag for each boy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha crouched down to the boy’s level but spoke to Wanda. “That’s okay, because we’re going to have so much fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Rio come down the steps and greet the boys. “Hey guys!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at the two redheaded children and dramatically widened her eyes and leaned so it gave the impression she was sharing a secret with them. “Auntie Rio made some cookies last night, they’re in the kitchen, and I bet you can sneak a few.” She winked and both boys took off down the hall to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to corrupt them.” Wanda smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll supervise.” Rio said and followed the tiny gingers down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood again and looked at Wanda. “Isn’t free childcare a bitch?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just blinked at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I promise no witchcraft or child sacrifice.” Agatha crossed her heart and smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda grinned. “I’ve gotta run, but please, do not ruin my children.” She made her way towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh!” Agatha placed a hand on her chest like she was offended. “Moi?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda raised her eyebrows and walked onto the porch.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would never.” Agatha grabbed the handle of the door. “Hey boys! Wanna learn how your mommies met? Can you spell ‘affair’?” She shouted in a way that would never reach the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha. Ha.” Wanda deadpanned. “Are we still on for dinner tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, I swear I see you more now than when we were married.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So we’ll meet there at six?” Wanda asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, if I don’t maim or kill your spawn by then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll pick them up in a few hours.” Wanda yelled as she left and got in her car.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled and shut the door before hearing her wife’s voice carry from the kitchen. “Tommy Maximoff-Romanov, I see that cookie!” Rio playfully scolded.
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed at Rio’s antics and started walking down the hall. “My client is innocent!” Agatha faux-defended as she reached her wife and the kids.
    </p>
<p>
     Later in the day, after Wanda picks up the boys, Agatha and Rio wait at the agreed upon restaurant. When they’re seated, and the waiter who takes their drink order looks at Rio in a way that Agatha does not appreciate. He scurries away to fetch their drinks when Agatha feels her wife’s hand place itself on her thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let it go, mi amor.” Rio softly says, already noticing the clench of Agatha’s jaw.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knows her wife has a face that men would go to war for, write songs about. And they both get hit on or checked out when in public together. She understood it’s bound to happen, but that doesn’t mean she has to like it.
    </p>
<p>
     “He does it again, and he’ll regret it.” Agatha muttered, looking over the menu.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio can respond, Nat and Wanda arrive and sit, immediately apologizing for being late and explaining the boys had meltdowns over being left with the nanny.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s why we try to have family watch them whenever possible.” Natasha explained and slung an arm around Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     It surprised Agatha to hear that. She and Rio had watched the twins too many times to count, the boys called them their aunts. Rio and Nat routinely hung out, usually to do some physically violent workout, like kickboxing. They had spent holidays and went to pride together. Other than Jen and Alice, Nat and Wanda were easily the people they saw the most. But still, being referred to as family? It made Agatha smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Nat, do you have any leads?” Rio leaned over the table, very obviously invested in the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scrunched her eyebrows, looking at Wanda for what the fuck their wives were referring to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your wife is trying to get my wife to procure her a very rare Russian knife.” Wanda explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dagger.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dagger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Both Rio and Nat corrected at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, I should’ve guessed that.” Agatha smirked at her wife’s absurdity.
    </p>
<p>
     “I might have a connect.” Nat replied to Rio’s question.
    </p>
<p>
     “A ‘connect’? Are you a government spy?” Wanda taunted.
    </p>
<p>
     Before the conversation could continue, the waiter returned with drinks, four glasses of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, a whole table of beautiful women, it must be my lucky night.” The waiter said in what Agatha could only describe as the douchiest tone she’s ever endured.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand squeezed her leg, silently telling Agatha to not antagonize the man.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me guess, bachelorette party?” He keeps going, maybe he’s hoping they’ll tip him better.
    </p>
<p>
     Nat smirks. “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The hottest family reunion in the city?” He looks so proud of himself.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re getting colder.” Wanda entertains and sips her wine.
    </p>
<p>
     And even though both couples are touching each other, actively engaged in PDA, men never use context clues.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I give up. How do you all know each other, and do I have a chance with any of you?” He’s chuckling, but in the way where men joke to try and find the answer they want.
    </p>
<p>
     And that was Agatha’s last straw, plastering on a sickeningly sweet smile, she looked at the dumbass in question. She bats her eyelashes, looking as innocent as can be, not at all like a snake about to rip this man’s head off.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Rio snicker under her breath, knowing full well what hell her wife was about to unleash.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s really a sweet story.”
    </p>
<p>
     Poor son of a bitch didn’t know what he had coming.
