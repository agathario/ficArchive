     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      AU: When Thanos snaps his fingers to end half of life in the universe Rio Vidal, Lady Death herself, uses the chaos and the power released into the universe to do the one thing she wants most; bring back the son she shared with Agatha Harkness from the Afterlife. Once she has her seven-year-old son back there is only one other thing Rio wants, Agatha, but under the influence of the Darkhold Agatha is hidden, even from Death herself.
      <br/>
      After five years of searching Rio finally feels Agatha again, but it’s too late as the great Agatha Harkness becomes powerless, trapped under the spell of the Scarlett Witch. Not letting this be the end of their story, of their family, Death and Her son dedicate everything to working out a way to break through; watching over Agatha, never being far away even if she doesn't know them, until finally, after three years, it’s time to put their plan into motion; a plan that rests solely on Nicky's shoulders as his identity becomes a protected secret, even from Death herself.
     </p>

     Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      AN: So, for a while I have been obsessed with the idea of teen actually being Nicky, rather than Billy, and that evolved into Nicky and Rio working together prior to Agatha All Along to ‘wake’ Agatha up, and then this evolved into this. I am very excited for this, have a detailed plan, hope you like what this is.
      <br/>
      This will address the time from the snap to Agatha All Along (Will be more AU but will still have elements from at least episodes 1-5, maybe beyond that) and then the events that follow.
      <br/>
      This chapter is on the shorter size as it sets a lot up.
      <br/>
      I have had this chapter and the first six chapters done for a few days, but I wanted to see how 1x06 played out before posting just in case it revealed something I wanted to incorporate, which turns out I didn’t need to worry about, though I will say that the way sigils and are made in this story is a little different, and Wanda’s spell will be a little harder to reverse. I will be doing my best to update regularly but my life is pretty messy at the moment so I can’t give an exact schedule just yet.

</p>
<p>
     When you’ve existed for eternity, there aren’t a lot of experiences that are new, but what Rio Vidal, also known as Lady Death, feels when A Mad Titan snaps his fingers, harnessing the power of all six infinity at once, is definitely a new experience.
    </p>
<p>
     As the universe unsurprisingly falls into chaos as power that hasn’t been felt since the beginning of time is released Rio realises feels something else that she has never felt before that the vale between life and death is thinner than it has ever been. Not caring about the consequences, not knowing if what she wants to do is even possible but knowing that she has to try, that she can’t pass up this opportunity, Rio puts all her focus, all her power, into one goal; getting to her son who died one hundred and fifty-five years ago.
    </p>
<p>
     After spending eternity delivering people to where they need to go after they died Rio has visited the vale many times, what she hasn’t done is cross over it herself. After punching through the already thin vale, making a hole big enough for her to fit through, Rio just focuses on her son, wiling to be with him, and as she travels through the realms she’s spent eons delivery people to but never visiting herself, Rio feels her strength slipping away from her, like she has the weight of everything pushing against her, trying to pull her to back to where she came from, but she doesn’t care, all she cares about is getting to her son, her Nicky, and that gives her the strength to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     Having no idea how much time has passed Rio finally hears a laugh she has never forgotten, and right away she knows she is where she will find him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky! Nicky, can you hear me!” Rio exclaims, doing her best to look around, but it’s almost like her eyes don’t work, a sensation she has never experience before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy?” Nicky’s voice asks, and Rio sees what she thinks he is, looking just the same as when he died at seven years old, except not sick, and without a doubt Rio knows that is really him, she can feel that his soul feels the same as it did when he first came into existence. It feels like the incredible mix of her and Agatha that he is and because of that she knows, without a doubt, that he is her Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Nicky! It’s me, I need you to come to me, Mi Conejito, follow my voice, can you do that?” Rio asks as and what feels like a couple of seconds later Rio sees him come closer to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “MOMMY!” Nicky yells excited, and even though neither of them have physical forms at the moment the only way Rio can describe what she feels next is the feeling of hugging her son once more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’ve missed you, so much,” Rio says to her son, doing her best to ‘hold’ him close as she knows she is never going to let him go again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you too, and Mama,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, we’ve missed you too, so much,” Rio says, knowing she can speak for both of them about that even though it has been a very long time since they have seen each other. “Do you want to be with us again, Nicky?” Rio asks, speaking quickly as she doesn’t know how long she has until she is forced out of this realm, all she knows is she can feel an incredible strength pushing against her, trying to force her out of this realm. “Would you like to come with me?” Rio asks, desperately hoping he will say yes, but she won’t force him, even if it breaks her not to.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do!” Nicky says without hesitation. “I want to be with you and Mama,” Nicky confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I need you to hold onto me, okay, really tight,” Rio says, having no idea if this is going to work but needing to try, knowing that this is going to be the only chance she is going to get. “No matter what, don’t let go, okay, don’t let go, no matter what, just keep holding on, don’t let go,” Rio says to her son. “Can you do that?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can, Mommy,” Nicky says as he ‘jumps’ into her arms, and as he ‘wraps’ his legs around Rio’s waist Rio holds onto him tighter than she has ever held onto anything in her entire existence, and stops fighting the sensation trying to force her to go back. The second Rio stops fighting she can feel herself being flung backwards, and all she focuses on is holding Nicky, holding him tight, and not letting him go as they are forced out of a place Rio truly believes neither of them belong.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After being flung back the next sensation Rio feels is pain, something she hasn’t felt a whole lot of, but as she opens her eyes and looks around Rio realise two things. The first is that she is lying on her back in a field, clearly back on Earth, the second is that she isn’t alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky! Nicky!” Rio yells as she moves, with some difficulty, to where her son, who once again looks exactly the same as before he got sick, but is actually wearing the pyjamas he was wearing when he died. Getting to Nicky’s side Rio doesn’t hesitate for a second before she reaches out to him to her absolute relief, he is solid, he is real. “Nicky?” Rio asks, her voice breaking. “Nicky, can you open your eyes?” Rio asks and for the first time in over a hundred- and fifty-years Rio sees her son open his eyes, that are so much like hers and look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Mommy,” Nicky says, smiling at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Mi Conejito,” Rio says, tears of joy coming to her eyes as she never thought this was possible, and she quickly pulls Nicky into her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, am I alive?” Nicky asks as he hugs his mother, not even complaining that his mother is hugging him so tightly that it almost hurts, as he understands enough to know that what just happened is amazing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Nicky, yeah you are,” Rio says as she continues to hug her son, feeling, below the current chaos of the universe, that not only is her son alive, the same age he was when he died, but he is perfectly healthy too; something which means everything to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, as he very much wants to be alive. “Mommy? Where’s Mama?” Nicky asks, looking around and not seeing his other mother, who he also deeply missed, who he also really wants to see again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits, as she forces herself to let go of her son so she can look at him, as seven years after Nicky died her love, her wife, Nicky’s other mother, Agatha Harkness, obtained the Darkhold, the book of the damned, and used it to hide from her; that damn book being the only thing powerful enough to hide a person from Death. “But Nicky, I promise. We’re going to find her,” Rio says, knowing that no matter what it takes she will find Agatha, she will reunite her with their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pinkie promise?” Nicky asks, looking up at his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pinky promise,” Rio says and the two of them do just that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, I miss Mama too,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Rio admits, even though she has spent over a century tyring to not think about that fact, and once she does, she has to close her eyes for a second as her vision has gone blurry.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, are you okay?” Nicky asks concerned, as he can tell that something doesn’t seem right, his mother doesn’t ‘feel’ as ‘strong’ as she always used to feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think I’m just a little tired,” Rio tells him, but she has a nagging feeling that breaking through the vale like she just did used more of her strength than she realised. “So how about we find somewhere to stay tonight,” Rio says, being sure that with the chaos of everything that has just happened she is going to be able to find them a place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mommy,” Nicky says, and with some difficulty Rio manages to get to her feet, feeling a little unsteady as she does, but to her relief it passes.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Rio is on her feet, she takes off the thin jacket she is wearing and puts it around Nicky who has also gotten to his feet, as while it isn’t much it will give him some warmth, thankfully it’s not that cold so he should be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think you can walk?” Rio asks Nicky, as considering how she feels she doesn’t think it would be a good idea to use magic to travel.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Nicky responds. While he doesn’t completely understand what’s been going on he knows that he had to leave his moms, that he was in a different place, and that it’s been a long time since he has to do things like walk, and even breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, let me know the second you need me to carry you,” Rio tells her son, as while she isn’t completely sure she will be able to she knows that if her son needs her to she will find a way.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will,” Nicky promises as he reaches out and takes his mother’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     As she once again feels her sons’ hand in hers, something she even let herself believe she would feel again, Rio starts to walk, each step feeling like it is taking everything in her but knowing she can’t stop until she gets Nicky to a safe place.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For almost an hour Rio and Nicky walk together, Rio not letting go of her sons hand for even a split second, as she realises that there is definitely something wrong with her, until they finally they get to a little village. Considering what she knows Thanos has just done Rio isn’t surprised to find that this little village on the Isel of Man is pretty empty.
    </p>
<p>
     Using that for her advantage Rio first takes Nicky to market where she collects enough food for a few days as while she doesn’t need food, though she does enjoy it especially when cooked by Agatha, Nicky does, and she knows, without a doubt, that she is always going to make sure her son has everything he needs.
    </p>
<p>
     Once food, as well as a few other supplies they may need, is taken care of Rio leads Nicky over to the village inn, where she breaks into a room for them, being pretty sure that no one is going to care about a little breaking and entering with everything else going on. As she wanted to make sure they would be safe Rio broke into the room in a way where she would still be able to lock the door, which is exactly what she does, as Nicky walks over to the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy? What’s wrong?” Nicky asks worried as he sits on the bed, and Rio, with some difficulty, puts the food, and other supplies, down on the table, and squats down in front of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy’s a little tired, Mi Conejito. So, I’m going to make sure we’re safe, and then I’m going to sleep for a little while,” Rio says, knowing that when he died Nicky was too young to understand that his mommy doesn’t sleep so he won’t find anything odd about her needing to sleep. “While I’m asleep you can’t leave this room, okay? The bathroom is through there,” Rio says, pointing to it, feeling herself become weaker with every word “So use it when you need, and we have plenty of food, but you cannot leave this these rooms, and you can’t let anyone in,” Rio explains, wanting to make sure Nicky is as safe as possible as it’s what she cares about most.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if it’s Mama?” Nicky asks, having complete, unshakable faith, in his Mama, he truly believes that she will be able to find them, no matter what.
    </p>
<p>
     “If it’s Mama, let her in,” Rio says, though she very much doubts Agatha will suddenly appear, in fact, she doesn’t even know if Agatha survived Thanos’s extermination, something she is doing her best not to think about, as while she always believed, no matter what Agatha did, that she would able to feel it if Agatha as actually died, with the chaos that the universe is currently in that’s not even something she be certain off. “But no one else,” Rio explains, reaching out and pushing Nicky’s dark hair out of his face. “I need you to be brave, Sweetheart, can you do that?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can do that, Mommy,” Nicky promises.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good Boy, I’m so proud of you, I love you so much,” Rio says, needing her son to know that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Love you too,” Nicky responds, and once he does Rio stands up, stumbling a little as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she is standing up Rio uses the last bit of strength, she has to put up runes to keep Nicky safe, knowing that whatever is happening to her is worth it because she knows Nicky is okay, before collapsing on the bed just as the last rune is in place, her last conscious thought being, “I brought him back to us, Agatha, I finally brought him back,”

     Chapter 2
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As his mom collapses onto the bed Nicky is scared at first, but then he remembers the promise he made.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can be brave, Mommy,” Nicky assures Rio, there being a feeling deep inside of him, a feeling which he doesn’t completely understand, that tells him his mommy is going to be okay, but it’s going to take time.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking around the room Nicky sees a lot of things he has never seen before, and things like lights that just seem different than how he remembers. As he looks around Nicky sees something that he does know, a blanket, and pillow, remembering what his mother’s would do for him every night Nicky picks up a blanket, and a pillow which he carries over to his mother. Being gentle as he doesn’t want to hurt her Nicky gently lays the blanket over before lifting Rio’s head a little and putting the pillow underneath her, trying to make her more comfortable, not realising that a small beam of blue, that has a green and purple hue, magick goes out of him and into Rio as he does.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s better,” Nicky says approvingly as he looks around. As he is sure that his mommy is as comfortable as possible Nicky starts to explore the room, making sure not to break the promise he made by leaving, and starts to inspect the things he has never seen before. As he finds everything fascinating Nicky knows that he wants to know as much as possible about this new world he has woken up in and hopes that he will get the chance to.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As he has been experiencing a timeless existence for so long Nicky doesn’t realise just how long he has been in the hotel room with his unconscious mother, all he knows he misses her. While Rio has been unconscious for three days Nicky has been learning everything he can about the room, and bathroom, he is in, and through his exploration he has found a book to read and more exciting for him he figured out how to turn on the TV, which he is watching when he realises his mommy is starting to wake up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy?” Nicky asks, jumping down form the bed he was lying on and walking over to the bed where Rio is. “Mommy? Are you awake?” Nicky asks and to his second later Rio bolts upright, a look of fear on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky!” Rio exclaims, clearly terrified for him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m right here, Mommy,” Nicky says, and the second she sees him Rio moves quickly and embraces him, needing to once again remind herself that he is alive, that everything that happened wasn’t just a dream.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are, you really are,” Rio says amazed, as she hugs him, kissing the top of his head. “Are you okay?” Rio asks, as she breaks apart from him, trying to figure out how long she has been unconscious for, wanting to know just how long she has left him alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Nicky says with a nod. “I’ve been watching people in the box,” Nicky says, pointing at the TV, causing Rio to smile at that description. “Is it magick, Mommy?” Nicky asks curious, as the TV reminded him of ways his mothers would bring his bedtime stories alive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not exactly, it’s technology,” Rio says, before picking him up and carrying Nicky over to the bed where they both sit, Rio putting Nicky on her lap and keeping her arms around him; knowing that it feels like everything to her to have her son in her arms again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, what do you know about we’re you’ve been? About how long you’ve been there?” Rio asks, feeling that now she is feeling a little stronger, though she knows she is not at her full power, that this is a conversation they need to have.
    </p>
<p>
     “I died,” Nicky says, and while she may be death herself it does hurt Rio to hear her son talk so casually about his own death. “I wasn’t scared, I knew you made sure I was safe, there was no pain, but I missed you and Mama,” Nicky admits. “I just wanted to be with you again…. It felt wrong that I wasn’t,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was wrong,” Rio confirms, as while she knew that it was her sons time when he died, that he needed to move on, that didn’t prevent it from feeling completely wrong, a feeling which she knows Agatha agreed with.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been gone a long time,” Nicky says, knowing that, though he couldn’t tell how long.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have, too long,” Rio says, kissing the top of his head. “While you’ve been gone a lot has changed,” Rio admits, trying to think of the best way to explain. “One of the things that have changed is that people have invented amazing things, things that are almost like magick,” Rio explains, that being the best explanation she can think to give.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Nicky says amazed. “Do witches still have to hide?” Nicky asks curious, as he remembers both his mothers always teaching him about making sure he was careful who he used his magick around.
    </p>
<p>
     “We do,” Rio confirms, knowing that while Superheroes have become common witches still remain mostly hidden, something which is probably a good thing. “Nicky, do you remember what Mama was teaching you about how to use your magick?” Rio asks, as she knows that Nicky was just starting to come into his powers before, he got sick, and that Agatha was starting to teach him as their magicks were similar, that their magicks connected them in a way Rio didn’t completely understand, and that Agatha wanted to make sure he truly understood it. She wanted to make sure he never felt the shame or self-hate her mother made her feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “A little,” Nicky admits, then he gets a sheepish look on his face. “The bathroom was really dark, so I used magick to make it light,” Nicky admits, feeling worried that he did something wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Mi Conejito, that’s okay, you did nothing wrong,” Rio assures him.
    </p>
<p>
     “When we find Mama will she teach me magick again?” Nicky asks curious, and Rio can tell that he wants that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure she will,” Rio says, believing that, though she hopes that whatever lessons Agatha gives don’t include the Darkhold as she doesn’t want that damn book anywhere near their son. “But until we find her how about you and I work together to see just what you can do?” Rio asks, as she knows that she needs to make sure Nicky has at least some control over his magick, that it’s too dangerous for both of them for him not to, and for a moment Nicky looks hesitant, as magick is always something he shared more with his Mama than his Mom, but he gives a small nod.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “It will just be until we find Mama, and then you can get back to your lessons together,” Rio assures her son, as she can see his hesitance, something she doesn’t take personally as she saw the way magick connected Agatha and Nicky; something which not only amazed to witness, but which she considered a privilege to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like learning from you too, Mommy, I just know that I’m meant to learn magick with, and from, Mama,” Nicky explains, and Rio would bet that he doesn’t understand everything he is saying, even though he is certain of what he is saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Sweetheart, I know, it’s okay,” Rio assures him. “When we find Mama, she is going to be so happy to teach you again, to be with you again,” Rio assures Nicky, knowing that without a doubt.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to be happy too,” Nicky responds. “How long do you think until we find her?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits, as she knows that she can’t predict anything because of the damn Darkhold. “But I know we’re not going to give up until we find her,” Rio says, knowing that she doesn’t care how long it takes, she just hopes it doesn’t take too long as she doesn’t want Agatha to miss too much of their sons second chance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama would never give up on us,” Nicky says in a matter of fact tone of voice. “We can’t give up on her,”
    </p>
<p>
     “We won’t, Mi Conejito, no matter what, I promise,” Rio assures her son as the two of them drift into silence as they sit together, Rio having no idea where to start the search for Agatha but knowing that she isn’t going to give up until they find her, while Nicky is just glad to be alive again.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For over two weeks Rio and Nicky have stayed in at the Inn they broke into the Isle of Man, doing so for three reasons; the first is that Rio needed time to heal, the second is Rio wanted to slowly introduce Nicky to the new world not wanting him to become overwhelmed, and the third, a reason she didn’t even tell Nicky, is that a part of Rio was hoping that Agatha would feel such a surge of magick that she would come to investigate.
    </p>
<p>
     As two weeks passed with no sign of Agatha Rio knew it was time for them to move on and start their search. While Rio knows she doesn’t have all her strength back, she does know that she is strong enough to travel. Once they get back to the mainland Rio debates where to start the search and as she feels a familiar tug which tells her she is needed to do her job.
    </p>
<p>
     Knowing she can’t take Nicky with her Rio brings them to a place that she and Agatha once considered their sanctuary, their safe place, as while she suspects it would be the last place Agatha would go to it is a place where Rio knows Nicky would be safe, which is what she needs right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, what is this place?” Nicky asks as Rio leads him into a small cottage hidden in an English forest, one that she has checked in on ever few months to make sure was not just still standing, but still safe.
    </p>
<p>
     “My first home,” Rio says, as in her entire existence this was the first place that felt like a home to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You lived here with Mama,” Nicky realises, as he looks around at the small living area.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can tell that?” Rio asks curious, wondering just what he is sensing, and Nicky nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “You and Mama lived here…. a long time ago… you were happy,” Nicky realises, not feeling completely sure how he knows that, but knowing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we were,” Rio confirms. “We lived here after we got married,” Rio explains, as after they met, after Agatha got freedom from her mother, she and Agatha spent fifty years exploring the world together, causing chaos, before getting married.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love that story,” Nicky says with a smile, as the story of how his parents got married is one of his favourite stories ever.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Rio admits, and as she does, she finds herself being swept back into her memory.
    </p>

      Surrounded by darkness Rio and Agatha, side by side, made their way in since towards small lights in the distance. After walking for about a minute Rio and Agatha walked into a clearing where there were several lit touches waiting for them.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “You did all this?” Agatha asked, as she looked around, seeing that the entire clearing was covered in flowers as well as well as torches to make it bright.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I wanted it to be special,” Rio said, as she led Agatha to the centre of the clearing, where there is a specific circle having been made out of flowers.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “It’s amazing,” Agatha said amazed, as before meeting Rio she never had someone who would do something so incredible for her. “I love you,” Agatha said to Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I love you too,” Rio said as she reached out and put pushed Agatha’s hair out of her face. “Mi Amour? What’s wrong?” Rio asked, as she saw hesitance behind Agatha’s eyes.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Are you sure you want this?” Agatha asked hesitantly. “Sure, you want me?” Agatha asked in a quite voice.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire existence,” Rio told Agatha. “You are the most incredible person I have ever met, you are my heart, my soul, my everything, and I want to make it official,” Rio told Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “That’s what I want too,” Agatha said. “I just never thought I deserved something like this, never thought I deserved to be loved,” Agatha said, all the hateful words her mother said over her lifetime replaying clearly in her mind, even though it has been half a century since she died.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “You do,” Rio said, before leaning forward and kissing Agatha, giving her a gentle, tender kiss rather than one that is as passionate as they usually exchanged. “And I’m going to spend the rest of eternity making you believe that,” Rio said, and once she did she realised something. “Midnight, on a full moon, it’s time,” Rio said to Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “It is,” Agatha confirmed. “Let’s do this,” Agatha said, and the two of them took a step back from each other.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Once they both took a step back from each other Rio and Agatha both clasped hands, and perform a ritual the spent a year researching, one that bound them both magically and spiritually, forever, one that essentially married them in every way that mattered.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Mommy?” Nicky asks, as his mother has been staring out to space. “Mommy? Are you okay?” Nicky asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, Mi Conejito, I’m okay,” Rio says, as she shakes off memories of her past, something which is difficult considering where they are. As she does her best to shake off memories she feels a stronger tug which tells her she has to go do her job, which means she has to talk to Nicky as for the last couple of weeks she has been going to do her job while he has been sleeping and making sure she is back before he wakes, but she knows she can’t hide that from him any longer. “Let’s sit down,” Rio says, leading Nicky over to the couch and the two of them sit down. “Nicky, do you remember when I would sometimes have to go away to do my job?” Rio asks as being death herself she doesn’t have handle everything alone, she can delegate certain things, even if she has to handle most things herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you leaving me, Mommy?” Nicky asks, becoming upset.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not for long,” Rio admits, hitting that she is hurting her son, but she has no choice. “My job is very important and there are things that only I can do so I have to go, but I won’t be gone for long, and I promise, I will come back,” Rio assures Nicky, it feeling wrong to leave her son alone, but when she doesn’t know where Agatha is she has no other option as there is not a single other being in the universe that she would trust with their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pinkie promise?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pinkie promise,” Rio says, and the two of them do a pinkie promise. “While I’m gone, you’re going to stay here, and I’ll make sure you’re safe, but you can’t leave, okay? You have to stay inside,” Rio says, as she knows it’s the only way to keep him safe is if he is inside a structure she can secure, a structure she can hide from everyone. “Can you do that for me?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can Mommy,” Nicky assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says relieved, feeling another tug. “Do you want to look around the cottage?” Rio asks, as she wants to make sure Nicky is comfortable before she goes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky responds, and Rio proceeds to show him around, making sure he knows where everything he is going to need, including the bed that is his, is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be back as soon as I can,” Rio promises Nicky, giving him a hug and a kiss on his head. “I love you,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Nicky responds, and when he and Rio break apart Rio reluctantly walks away from her son, leaving him behind but doing everything in her power to make sure he is safe; something which makes her feel comforted because she knows Nicky would be safe, but which does nothing to lessen her guilt she is feeling.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A few hours after Rio walked away from Nicky, she lowers the protection of the cottage before walking back in. As she walks into the cottage Rio is surprised to find Nicky fast asleep on the couch rather than in his own bed like she was expecting.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were waiting for me,” Rio realises, being able to remember when Agatha would do the same, on the same couch. For a few moments Rio watches her son sleep, memorizing everything about him, taking comfort in the fact that she can see him breathing, before walking over to him. “Let’s get you more comfortable,” Rio says as she gently picks up her son, and carries him into his room.
    </p>
<p>
     Once in Nicky’s room Rio gently lays Nicky down on the bed, tucks him in and places a gentle kiss on his head. “I’ve missed you so much,” Rio says to her son, before sitting down next to him, planning on watching him until morning to make sure he is okay.

<strong>
      August 9

      2018
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Just over two months have passed since Rio managed to pull of a miracle and bring her son back to life and ever since the two of them have been obsessively searching for Agatha. Between wanting to make sure Nicky was safe and protected, and wanting to slowly introduce Nicky to the new world, so that he is not overwhelmed, Rio has been moving them very frequently, though she knows the cottage will be there for when they want to stay in one place for a little longer.
    </p>
<p>
     For the last two months Rio has been using the times where Nicky has been sleeping to do one of two things either her job, as doesn’t want to leave him alone when he is awake for too long, or obsessively researching, tyring to find anything that could be Agatha, or lead them to her, but as, Nicky sleeps on a sunny Thursday morning Rio isn’t doing either of those things, she is doing something which to her is much more important. Just like she has been all night Rio is in the kitchen, of the current house they are squatting in, putting the finishing touches on something she has been working on all night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Done,” Rio says proudly as she places the last candle on a, rather lopsided, birthday cake, before lighting all eight of them. “I think he’s going to like it,” Rio says, knowing that she could have done a better job if she used magick, but making a birthday cake for Nicky is something she wanted to do from scratch, without magick.
    </p>
<p>
     Picking up the cake, and the present she has spent weeks tracking down, Rio heads into the, very comfortable bedroom, Nicky is sleeping in, knowing that thanks to the Snap it is easy to find abandoned houses in very good condition something which she has been using to her advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, wake up, Mi Conejito,” Rio says as she walks into the room, turning the light on she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy?” Nicky asks, then she notices what she is holding. “It’s my birthday,” Nicky realises, smiling at that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Rio confirms as she walks over to him. “Do you remember what that means?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “It means I get to make a wish,” Nicky says excitedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, and you get presents too,” Rio tells her son, lowering the cake so that it is closer to him. “Happy birthday Nicky,” Rio tells her son. “Make a wish,” Rio says, and getting a look of complete concentration on his face Nicky blows out all eight candles in one go. “One go, good job!” Rio tells her son. “So,” Rio says, as she puts the cake on the bedside table, but keeps hold of the present she is holding, and sits down next to him. “Do you want to tell me what you wished for?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama,” Nicky says, and Rio has to fight back tears at that, as her heart breaks for her son. “I wished for Mama to be here… that’s what I want most,” Nicky admits, as he looks up at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s what I want most too, and Nicky I’m really sorry we haven’t found her yet,” Rio says, once again finding herself cursing the Darkhold as she knows that if it wasn’t for that damn book she would have been able to reunite Nicky with his other mother by now, which is what she knows Agatha wants more than anything, but she can’t help but feel like she is letting her son down by not having already done so. “But we’re going to keep trying, we’re not going to give up,” Rio assures Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky responds, believing that, but it is also clear that he is sad about not seeing his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know it’s not the same as Mama being here, but I have something of hers, something I wanted to give you,” Rio says, giving the present she is holding to Nicky. “Open it,” Rio says encouragingly, and Nicky opens the present to reveal a very old book.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a book,” Nicky says, but even he can tell that it is more than that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is, but it’s more than that,” Rio explains, confirming what Nicky has already realised. “Mama has always wanted to learn everything she could about magick, she always wants to learn more, understand more, always wants to expand her knowledge,” Rio explains, knowing that Agatha would often say that knowledge can be more powerful than raw power, and one of the things she loved most was watching Agatha study. “Long before you were born, she started to write her own spell book so she could keep a record of her knowledge,” Rio explains, knowing that that particular book doesn’t have anything too dangerous in it as she checked. “She gave it to me for safekeeping, but I know it’s always meant to be yours,” Rio explains to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama wrote this whole book?” Nicky asks amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “She did,” Rio says, knowing it’s not the only book of magick Agatha has written but it’s not the time for that conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Nicky says amazed, as he starts to flicker through the pages, finding it fascinating, looking so much like Agatha as he does, and together Nicky and Rio celebrate Nicky’s eight birthday by eating birthday cake in bed while Nicky reads the book that makes him feel a little closer to his mama; but while they do have a good time it is clear that they both feel Agatha’s absence.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      October 2018
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Another two months have passed since Nicky’s eighth birthday and ever he and Rio have continued to look for Agatha. As she heard some talk of a magick user causing chaos in the Scottish Highlands Rio has taken Nicky there, but to her disappointment it quickly became clear that it wasn’t Agatha behind the chaos.
    </p>
<p>
     Returning to the current house she and Nicky have been squatting in, having been gone longer than she would like, Rio is surprised to find all the windows open, something which worries her as she knows it’s quiet cold.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Rio calls worried s she walks in. “Nicky where are you?” Rio asks, as she looks around the main living area of the house they are staying in, and as she does, she sees Nicky huddled in the corner, clearly shivering. “NICKY!” Rio yells in terror as she runs to her son, feeling the most awful sense of déjà vu, as she throws herself down in front of him. “Nicky? Nicky? what happened, Mi Conjito?” Rio asks as she reaches out and touches her realising that he is cold to the touch.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted …. Some…fresh air… so I opened the window…. I couldn’t close it,” Nicky admits. “I’m sorry… I… couldn’t remember…. How to make…. Make a fire,” Nicky says as he continues to shiver, Rio feeling incredibly guilty about being gone for so long, as she knows this wouldn’t have happened if she was around.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Sweetheart, it’s okay, you have nothing to apologize for,” Rio says, as she pulls a blanket of the couch and using it to wrap around Nicky. “We’re going to get you warm, and we’re going to get you help, okay, you’re going to be okay,” Rio tells her son, her abilities as death telling her that her son isn’t currently dying but that he is very sick, which means she has only a small window of time. “Come on, Sweetheart, I’ve got you,” Rio says, gathering Nicky into her arms, holding the blanket around him, trying to keep him as warm, and close, as possible, before running, feeling glad that there is a car in the garage because it means she can drive him to the hospital, knowing that he is too weak to teleport him or travel by any other magical means.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Knowing that she broke every single road law that exists, and not caring at all, Rio finally gets to the nearest hospital. Not caring that she is stopped in the ambulance parking Rio ignores everyone trying to talk to her, trying to stop her, and just picks up her son, and carries him into the emergency room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Help! I need help!” Rio asks, her voice full of panic, as she carries Nicky into the emergency room, hating that they are in such an uncontrolled environment, but knowing that when it comes to saving someone’s life doctors can do more than she can.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” A nurse asks, coming out from beneath the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got home, and all the windows were open, he’s so cold, I don’t know how long he has been like this,” Rio explains, guilt rising up inside of her as she knows that if he dies, again, it will be her fault.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, follow me,” The nurse says, leading Rio to a bed. “What’s his name? how old is he?” The nurse asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky… Nicholas Scratch,” Rio says, saying the fake name she and Agatha decided on when Nicky was born as a way to protect him from their enemies without even thinking about even though the name they both considered to be his true name is Nicholas Vidal-Harkness. “He’s eight,” Rio answers as she puts Nicky down on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Any medical conditions? Or past medical issues?” The nurse asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pneumonia,” Rio says, her voice breaking, as while it wasn’t called that a hundred and fifty-five years ago that’s what killed her son. “Last year… It was bad,” Rio explains, stretching the truth a little, but from the point of view of Nicky’s body that’s when he had pneumonia. “Please, please help him,” Rio begs.
    </p>
<p>
     “We will, ma’am,” The nurse says, as several doctors come running over to the bed. “But we need you to give us some space so we can work,” The nurse says.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m not leaving my son,” Rio says, and one of the doctors walk over to her, as there is no way she is going to leave her son when he is so sick.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ma’am, we will do everything we can to help your son, we will give him our very best care, but we need you out of the room to do it,” The Doctor tells Rio, who looks over at Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to save him,” Rio threatens, though from the doctor’s perspective she just sounds like a desperate mother, which she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “We will do everything we can,” The doctor says, and two security guards practically drag Rio into the waiting room,
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky! I’m right here! I’m not going anywhere! I love you!” Rio yells to her son, as the security guards stand in front of the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll have to wait out here ma’am, the doctors will be out to talk to you when they can,” The security guard tells Rio, making it clear that they aren’t going to let her past as Rio realises that forcing her way past them will just mean she won’t be able to be with Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Damn it,” Rio says angrily, and she proceeds to walk over to the nearest wall which she punches as hard as she can. “Damn it Agatha, you should be here,” Rio says as she punches the wall again. “Why didn’t you have to become so obsessed with that damn book, why did you have to hide yourself,” Rio says, her voice breaking feeling both angry and devastated, knowing that this cannot be how Nicky’s second chance ends, and finding it easier to feel the anger at Agatha hiding herself rather than the guilt she feels for leaving Nicky alone. “We need you,” Rio mutters as she slides down the wall and breaks down into tears, having no idea what she is going to do if Nicky dies again.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea how long she has been waiting but knowing that she has ignored several ‘tugs’ that tells her she needs to do her job, Rio just sits on the ground, staring at the doors that lead into the ER until finally she sees the doors open and the doctors from earlier walk out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mrs Scratch,” The Doctor says, walking over to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “How is he?” Rio asks, not bothering to correct the doctor about her name, as while she can tell that he is alive, which means everything to her, she can’t tell more than that.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s stable,” The doctor answers. “He does have pneumonia again, and because of that we would like to admit him so that he can receive IV antibiotics,” The Doctor explains, Rio knowing that antibiotics is something that wasn’t an option last time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Doctor, is he going to be okay?” Rio asks, as she doesn’t care about anything other than that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I believe so,” The Doctor says. “We are only admitting him because he’s had pneumonia fairly recently, but from his test results, including the chest x-ray, I am confident that he will be able to go home in a few days,” The Doctor explains, causing Rio to feel unbelievably relieved.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says relieved. “Can I see him?” Rio asks as nothing is going to stop her, but she thought it would be best to ask first.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, nurse Athena will show you the way,” The Doctor says, and to Rio’s relief she is shown right through to where her son is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, hi Nicky,” Rio says, bending down and kissing his head, being pretty sure her healing ability won’t help because it didn’t help last time, but still trying, before sitting down next to him, taking his hand as she does. “You’re going to be okay, Mi Conejito and we’re going to find Mama, and everything’s going to be okay, I promise,” Rio says to her son, as she moves his hair out his face. “But you need to stay with me, okay? We can only find Mama together,” Rio says, and she just sits by Nicky and watches as he breathes, becoming hypnotised by his son’s chest rising and falling, her magick telling her that he is not out of the woods yet; which tells her she is not moving away from her sons side, no matter what the doctors say or do.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Three days have passed since Rio’s rushed Nicky to hospital and since being allowed to sit next to him she hasn’t left his side since, ignoring everything else, including her job. As both the doctors, and Rio’s magicks, say that Nicky is going to be okay he has been released from hospital.
    </p>
<p>
     Because she didn’t want to risk being far away from the hospital in case something else happens Rio has broken into another house closer to the hospital which is where she and Nicky are going to be staying, at least for a little while.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay? How’s your chest feeling?” Rio asks as she helps Nicky into the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m okay, Mommy,” Nicky assures his mother, as she tucks him in. “I feel much better,” Nicky assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, that’s really good,” Rio says, fighting back her reaction as she doesn’t want to scare Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, were you scared?” Nicky asks curious, and Rio debates the best way to answer that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I was,” Rio admits, as she moves and sits down next to him, feeling that if she wants Nicky to be honest with her then she should be honest with him. “Where you?” Rio asks curious, as she puts her arm around her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was,” Nicky admits. “I knew that you would do everything to help me, but I was scared,” Nicky admits. “I don’t want to leave you or Mama again,” Nicky admits, as he snuggles into Rio’s side.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want that either,” Rio admits, kissing the top of his head. “Nicky we’re going to find Mama, and we’re going to be together, the three of us, just like it always should have been,” Rio promises. “I love you so much,” Rio says to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Nicky responds. “Mommy, can you tell me a story?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” Rio assures him. “How about the story of how Mama and I made it so we could have you?” Rio asks, knowing she will have to leave out of some of the details.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky says interested, and Rio proceeds to tell her son the story of the Witches Road, and the lengths she and Agatha went to to make it so they were able to have a child that was biologically both of these.
    </p>

<strong>
      December 2018
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky got sick and to Rio’s absolute relief Nicky is doing a lot better. Because she couldn’t bare something like that happening again, Rio has made sure that every time she has to leave Nicky, she goes over how to make a fire, both with and without magick, and a few other basic skills to do her best to make sure he is okay when she can’t be with him.
    </p>
<p>
     As she realised that Christmas is coming, something which she usually ignores, Rio decided she wanted to make it special for Nicky and because of that she has brought him to London after their latest lead on Agatha turned out to be a dead end.
    </p>
<p>
     “Everything’s so… tall,” Nicky says shocked, looking around at all the tall buildings, as he and Rio walk down the straight together, Rio holding her son’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it is,” Rio tells her son. “We can go back to the country if this is too much,” Rio says, as they weave their way through the people together.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s….” Nicky starts to say, then he freezes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky? What’s wrong?” Rio ask concerned, as she has never seen him freeze like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “That lady is going to die,” Nicky says, sounding certain of that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “What lady?” Rio asks, trying to figure out what is going on, what her son has realised, but before Nicky can answer her question, they both hear a car honk and an awful crash, seconds later Rio feels a tug which tells her the woman is dead.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to help her move on,” Nicky says to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio says looking around for somewhere safe for Nicky to go “Can you wait at the café while I do that?” Rio asks her son, noticing a café right by them, who nods. “I’ll be right back,” Rio tells her son. “Okay, it will be seconds to you,” Rio explains, as while it will be longer for her it won’t be for Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be okay, Mommy,” Nicky assures his mother, before walking over to café, knowing that his mother needs to do her job, while Rio is focusing on doing her job so that she can get back to her son, knowing there is a very intense conversation they need to have.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A couple of hours after Nicky accurately predicted that someone was going to die, he and Rio are arriving back at the most recent house they are squatting in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy can I go read my book before diner?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not right now, there’s something we need to talk about,” Rio says as she leads Nicky over to the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want to talk about what happened in the street,” Nicky realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio confirms. “Nicky, how did you know that woman was going to die?” Rio asks, wanting to understand better what is going on with her son as while she and Agatha talked hypothetically about what ‘abilities’ Nicky could have inherited from her the reality is very different.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just knew,” Nicky says with a shrug, not being able to explain how he knew as he just knew. “She bumped my arm, and I just knew that she was going to die, that there was nothing that could have saved her,” Nicky explains, and Rio feels relieved that it seems that the ability is at least triggered by touch which likely means they are going to be able to control it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you ever experienced something like that before?” Rio asks curious, trying to make sense of everything, and Nicky nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “A few weeks ago, a bird flew into the house, I tried to pick it up and I just knew it was going to die, no matter what I did,” Nicky says, his voice breaking. “And it did Mommy,” Nicky says, tears coming to his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Sweetheart,” Rio says, leaning forward and embracing her son. “I’m sorry you’re experiencing this,” Rio admits, knowing it’s her fault, and feeling worried about the kind of effect this is going to have on Nicky as he grows up as she can’t imagine it’s a burden easy for him to carry.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why am I?” Nicky asks. “It feels different to my magick,” Nicky admits, as for him it feels like he has two ‘different’ sources of magick in him that feel different from each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because it is… in some ways,” Rio admits, as the two of them break apart so Rio can look at him. “Nicky, you know who I am,” Rio says, very much wishing Agatha was by her side for this conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, you’re Mommy,” Nicky says, like that is obvious, and Rio has to smile at that, knowing that when it came to Nicky, and Agatha too, they see her as herself, as Rio, first, not the cosmic being she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am,” Rio confirms. “But I’m also more than that,” Rio admits. “You know that, right?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Nicky confirms. “You’re death,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am,” Rio confirms. “And because you’re my son I think, just like you got magick from Mama, you’re getting some abilities from me too,” Rio tells her son, though she has no idea just what he is going to get from her. “Nicky, I’m going to be honest with you, I don’t know exactly what it means for you being my son,” Rio admits, knowing it was the exact kind of thing Agatha would research, not her. “I don’t know what you’re going to be able to do because of that, but what I do know is that we’ll figure it out together,” Rio promises. “You’re not alone Nicky, we’ll figure this out,” Rio assures her son, and while Nicky nods Rio notices something about the look on her face. “What is it, Mi Conejito? You can ask me anything, no matter what, always,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy is Mama dead?” Nicky asks, and it breaks Rio’s heart to even hear him asking that question.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio assures her son, as while she wasn’t certain when the snap first happened, she is sure of that now. “Nicky, Mama’s alive, I know that without a doubt,” Rio assures him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then why can’t we find her?” Nicky asks, and even though Rio has been expecting the question for months she knows preparing for it isn’t going to be any easier to answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because Mama is hiding herself from me,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? Why would Mama do that?” Nicky asks confused, as in his memories he only remembers his mothers loving each other, wanting to be with each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “A long time ago we had a fight, a really bad fight,” Rio admits, choosing her words carefully because she doesn’t want to risk Nicky realising that their fight was about his death because she doesn’t want him to blame himself, because she is the only one to blame “Mama was really angry, and upset, and because of that she made sure I couldn’t find her in the way I could find anyone else,” Rio admits. “But Nicky you need to know it’s me Mama is mad at, it’s me she doesn’t want to see, not you, never you,” Rio assures her son. “And I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that if Mama knew you were with me, she would make it so we could find her in a second,” Rio assures Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really miss her,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I miss her too,” Rio admits, and as she does, she gets an idea. “I have something for you, I was going to give it to you at Christmas, but I think you need it now,” Rio tells her son. “I’ll be right back,” Rio says, getting up, leaving her son feeling curious, and a few moments later she returns with a wrapped present, which she gives to Nicky. “I know this doesn’t make up for Mama not being here, and I am so sorry because it’s my fault,” Rio says, knowing that.  “But I thought you’d like this,” Rio reveals, and Nicky opens the gift to reveal a framed picture of Agatha, something which it took Rio months to track down as it turns out that while Agatha has been in a lot of pictures of her over the years there were very few where she was in the foreground rather than in the background, and even less that Rio considered good enough to give to their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s Mama,” Nicky says amazed, reaching up and touching the image, feeling that she looks just like she did when he last saw her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Rio confirms. “It’s not the same, but I thought that this way it would almost be like you could have Mama with you,” Rio tells her son, who hugs her in response.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Nicky says to his mother, the gift meaning everything to him. “Mommy?” Nicky asks hesitantly, without moving out of his moms arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Sweetheart?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “How are we going to find Mama if she’s hidden from you?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “By not giving up, and sticking together,” Rio assures her son, as she feels him nod against her, and Rio just continues to hug her son, feeling overwhelmed, guilty, and how much she loves her son all at the same time.

      February 2019
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky accurately predicted that someone was going to die, and while he hasn’t had any other moments like that, partly because Rio has been keeping them in secluded locations, away from other people, both Rio and Nicky are working on trying to figure out just what he inherited from his mother who happens to be Death.
    </p>
<p>
     As they have once again hit a dead end trying to find Agatha Rio, who could tell that Nicky was very disappointed, decided that she needs to do something to cheer her son up and after a lot of thinking she decided that the best way to do that is to take Nicky to one of the places where created a memory with Agatha that she still treasures.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, what are we doing here?” Nicky asks curious, as Rio has brough them to a frozen lake in the middle of nowhere.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we could go ice skating,” Rio reveals. “A really long time ago Mama and I came here, we were camping long time, keeping warm by magick,” Rio says, smiling slightly as she remembers back fondly, but she knows that the specific thing she is remembering isn’t something she will be sharing with her son anytime soon. “Then at midnight, under a full moon, we went ice skating, here,” Rio reveals. “We had the most incredible time,” Rio admits. “So, I was thinking, we could go ice skating together, what do you think?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like that,” Nicky responds, smiling as he likes doing thinks that make him feel close to both his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Rio and she uses magick to change the shoes they are both wearing into skates. “You ready?” Rio asks her son, who nods. “Then come on,” Rio says, as she takes her son’s hand, and leads him over to the ice.
    </p>
<p>
     Once on the ice Rio and Nicky start to skate together, Nicky being nervous at first, but he quickly relaxes, and they both end up having an amazing time together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, I want to try skating on my own,” Nicky says to her. “Can I?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, Mi Conejito,” Rio says, and she lets go of Nicky’s hand, allowing him to skate off on his own.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few minutes Rio watches as a hawk as Nicky skates around, looking beyond thrilled, and as he does Rio can imagine, just for a second, that Agatha is with them. She can imagine that the three of them are having an amazing moment together, as a family, rather than it being something else Agatha is missing out on because of her.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      March 2019
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     About a month has passed since Rio took Nicky skating and ever since they have continued their search for Agatha while also trying to figure out exactly what Nicky inherited from Rio. It’s the early hours of the morning and while Nicky is soundly asleep in his bed in the latest house, they are squatting in Rio isn’t, and not just because she doesn’t really need to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Sneaking into the room Nicky is in Rio realises that he must have fell asleep reading Agatha’s spell book, something which doesn’t surprise her, because it is open on the bed next to her. being as quiet as possible Rio checks to make sure he is sleeping soundly, which he is. After making sure Nicky is asleep, and peaceful Rio picks up the spell book, closes it, and puts it on the bedside table.
    </p>
<p>
     As she puts down the book Rio sees what else is there, the picture of Agatha, after glancing at Nicky, and once again checking to make sure he is asleep, Rio picks up the photo.
    </p>
<p>
     “I miss you,” Rio says to the picture, keeping her voice low so that she doesn’t wake Nicky. “Where are you today?” Rio asks, as she knows that Agatha will be in pain today as it’s the anniversary of when Nicky died. “Are you okay? Are you lost in the Darkhold?” Rio asks, as that terrifies her the possibility that Agatha is so corrupted, so lost, in the Darkhold that they will never be able to reach her. “I know you hate me, and if it meant finding you, I’d deal with that,” Rio admits. “I just want to see you again, want you to know Nicky,” Rio admits, reaching up and wiping a tear away, as she stares at the picture.
    </p>
<p>
     For a little while Rio stares at the picture of the women she loves before putting it down. After putting the picture down Rio walks over to an armchair that is in the corner of the room, where she sits down. Sitting in the chair Rio’s complete attention is on her son as she spends the rest of the night watching him sleep, knowing that with it being the anniversary of his death she needs to spend all night making sure he is okay.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>

     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Less than three months have passed since the anniversary of when Nicky died and as Rio wanted to give them a chance to breathe, to spend some time being able to figure out what their next move is going to be, where they are going to search next without making it so they have to move every few days Rio once again brought Nicky to the cottage she considers to be her first home where they have been staying for several weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     As it is about time for lunch Rio is walking outside the cottage where she sees Nicky clearly practicing with his magick as he is holding the spell book in one hand, is muttering in Latin, and his blue magick is clearly dancing around his other hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Rio asks, trying to get his attention before walking over to him so that she doesn’t actually surprise him, and Nicky turns to look at her. “What are you trying to do?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m trying to transmute plastic into flowers,” Nicky reveals, as he closes the book and sits down on the ground. “It’s not working,” Nicky says, feeling annoyed, as Rio walks over to him, noticing the frustrated look on her son’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Transmuting can be hard, you just need to practice,” Rio says as she sits down on the ground with Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just don’t understand,” Nicky says, feeling disappointed in himself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t understand what, Sweetheart?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “How I can blast, and move things, easily, but can’t do a spell that Mama described as simple,” Nicky says, feeling frustrated at his progress, and just like she does a hundred times a day Rio wishes that Agatha wasn’t hidden away beneath the Darkholds influence and was instead with them.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s different types of magick,” Rio says, trying to think of what Agatha would say if she were present, though she also knows the difficulty Agatha had with her magick when she was a child, so she doesn’t want that for Nicky. “Nicky, for a witch you’re still incredibly young, your magick is still developing,” Rio explains. “You’re powerful already because of what you inherited from Mama and I, but you’ve still got a long way to go,” Rio explains. “I don’t know what you’re going to be able to do when you’ve fully come into your powers, but I know that you can’t beat yourself up for not being able to do something when you’re still learning,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you don’t think Mama would be disappointed that I couldn’t do the spell?” Nicky asks sheepishly as he looks down at the ground, as he knows he never wants to disappoint his Mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not,” Rio assures him. “Your Mama would never be disappointed in you,” Rio tells her son, stressing the never, Nicky nods, as he starts to play with the grass.
    </p>
<p>
     While Nicky starts to play with the grass Rio can tell that he wants to say something else, but she can also tell that he isn’t quite ready and because of that she just watches, giving him silent support as she resists the urge to make a flower appear as she isn’t sure that will help with what he is currently feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been a year,” Nicky finally says, several minutes later.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio says, knowing that he is talking about the fact that it has been a year since she brought him back to life.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought we would have found Mama by now,” Nicky admits, and Rio feels a rush of guilt at that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I’m really sorry we haven’t,” Rio tells him, having no idea what else to say to that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you are, it’s not your fault Mommy,” Nicky assures his mother. “I just really want to see her again,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Rio admits, and the two of them drift into silence as they sit together, both thinking about how much they miss Agatha, how desperate they both are to see her again.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2019
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since the year Anniversary of Nicky being brough back to life and ever since Nicky has become more determined to learn as much as possible about his magick, reminding Rio more of Agatha with every day that passes.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s early on a Thursday morning and just like she did exactly a year ago Rio has stayed up all night to make a birthday cake for her son, one that looks better than the one she made a year before. Just like a year before Rio places candles on top of the cake, though this time it is nine of them, and once the candles are lit, she carries into the room Nicky is sleeping in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, Nicky wake up Mi Conjito,” Rio says as she walks into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy birthday Sweetheart,” Rio says to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m nine!” Nicky says excitedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are,” Rio confirms, feeling amazed about that fact. “Make a wish,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know exactly what I’m going to wish for,” Nicky admits, and the truth is Rio does too, so she doesn’t intend to ask what he wished for, before blowing out the candles.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nice job,” Rio says, before putting the cake down, cutting a piece for each of them, and once she does that she sits down next to her son, handing him one of the pieces.
    </p>
<p>
     “So is birthday cake breakfast in bed becoming a tradition?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think so,” Rio confirms, though she knows that Agatha may not approve.
    </p>
<p>
     “When’s your birthday, Mom?” Nicky asks curious, as the two of them
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve lived for eternity, I don’t have a birthday,” Rio tells her son, who pouts.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not fair,” Nicky says. “You should pick a day, and we’ll make that your birthday,” Nicky tells his mother, who knows that while she doesn’t see the point, she doesn’t want to destroy her sons happiness.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about you pick one, whatever day you want, we’ll pretend that’s my birthday,” Rio tells Nicky, and for a few moments he looks like he is seriously considering the options before his face breaks out in a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Halloween,” Nicky tells his mother. “It’s already kind of is, so we should celebrate it as your birthday,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Rio says with a laugh. “Halloween it is,” Rio confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says before taking a bite of cake.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, now that we’ve decided when my birthday is we’ve got to decide what we’re doing today for yours,” Rio tells her son. “We can do anything you want,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anything?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Within reason,” Rio clarifies, knowing that her version of reason is very different to anyone else, but because Nicky is hers and Agatha’s son adding that stipulation feels necessary. “So, what do you want to do?” Rio asks her son, knowing that she will do whatever she has to do to make what her son wants to do possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we try doing the Hexenbesen?” Nicky asks curious. “I really want to fly,” Nicky asks, looking excited about the possibility.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio says, an edge to her voice, surprising Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “But Mommy, I really want…” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said no, Nicholas,” Rio snaps, in a way she has never done with Nicky before.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” Nicky says, looking down, and become upset, not understanding what he did wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Nicky, I’m so sorry,” Rio says, feeling truly awful as she knows that Nicky doesn’t deserve to be snapped at.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, I shouldn’t have asked,” Nicky says, though he is incredibly confused about what he did wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, no, you have no reason to apologise, I do, I’m sorry,” Rio says to him. “I never want you to be afraid to ask me anything no matter what it may be,” Rio assures her son, realising that she owes him a story. “Growing up Mama wanted to fly, she wanted the freedom, but her mother,” Rio says, saying the word with more venom than Nicky has ever heard. “Wouldn’t let anyone ever do the Hexenbesen with her,” Rio says, pausing for a moment so she can carefully choose her next words as she knows that Nicky knows practically nothing about his grandmother, and she isn’t quite ready to enlighten him on that particular topic. “After we got together Mama and I would do the Hexenbesen together, we flew a lot, and she would say that it gave her a feeling of freedom she never thought she would have,” Rio says, having long ago added Agatha’s reaction to doing the Hexenbesen to her long list of reasons why she hates Evanora Harkness more than anyone else who has ever existed, and it is also why she used to make excuses for her and Agatha to fly together. “And then when you were a baby Mama would talk about how much she wanted to fly with you when you were old enough,” Rio says, knowing that they didn’t get the chance because Nicky died so young. “Because I can’t find her Mama is missing out on a lot of things with you. She’s missing out on a having a lot of first experiences with you, I’m not going to let your first Hexenbesen be one of them, it means too much to her,” Rio explains to her son, as she cannot do that to Agatha. “So, until we find your mom you’re staying on the ground, okay?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says. “I can wait,” Nicky says as while he desperately wants to fly from his moms words, he can tell how important it is to his mama so he will willingly wait until he can do the Hexenbesen with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says. “I know it’s not the same as flying, but how about we go to the beach? We can swim, that’s a little like flying,” Rio says, trying to think of a suitable subsite.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like that,” Nicky responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio responds, the two of them continue to eat their cake together then proceed to have an amazing day together at the beach.
    </p>

     Two months have passed since Nicky’s birthday and even though Rio knows that it is one of the last places in the universe Agatha would go to Rio has brought Nicky to Salem as there are a few things she felt it is important for Nicky to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome to Salem,” Rio says to her son, as the two of them walk around the centre of the town that has been decorated for Halloween, Rio being able to feel that despite Salem’s history there are still a lot of real witches around.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Nicky says amazed, as he looks around. “This is where Mama was born?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, a long time ago,” Rio admits, knowing that Salem has changed a lot, but it still feels familiar. “Come on, there’s something I want to show you,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mom,” Nicky responds, and he follows behind his mother, feeling curious about where she is going to lead him, but completely trusting her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About half an hour an hour later, Nicky feeling incredibly curious about where they are going, follows Rio into a clearing, one that she remembered with perfect clarity where it was despite it being difficult to get to location.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, what is this place?” Nicky asks, as he looks around, sensing something he can’t quiet describe.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is where Mama and I met, three hundred and twenty-six years ago,” Rio reveals. “She was standing right over there,” Rio says, pointing to where Agatha was standing when Rio first approached her, deciding not to mention that Agatha was standing over her mothers body when Rio approached her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Nicky says amazed. “Did you love her right away?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t realise it was love, but yeah, I think I did,” Rio admits, as she knows that Agatha Harkness made, and still makes, her feel things that no one else in the universe does.
    </p>
<p>
     “A lot of people died here,” Nicky realises, as he makes sense of what he is setting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, they did,” Rio confirms, wondering if she made a mistake by bringing Nicky to Salem, as Nicky continues to look around. While Rio can’t be sure to her it almost seems like Nicky is seeing beyond what is visible as he looks around, and while she is incredibly curious about that Rio doesn’t say anything as she wants to give him a chance to explain what he is experienced in his own time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, Grandmother was a really bad person, wasn’t she?” Nicky asks, looking up at his mother, who desperately hopes he hasn’t realised exactly what happened in this clearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Evanora Harkness has absolutely no right to be called grandmother by you,” Rio says, needing to make that clear, while still tyring to figure out exactly how she is going to address this as she knows it’s a delicate subject. “And yes, she was a really bad person,” Rio confirms. “She hurt Mama a lot,” Rio says, not wanting to go into more details, but also wanting Nicky to know enough to understand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you save Mama from her?” Nick asks Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Mama saved herself,” Rio says, smiling fondly as she knows that considering the hell Agatha grew up to it was huge that she managed to break free, even if she couldn’t completely control her magick. “But I considered it a privilege to watch,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama’s strong,” Nicky says, and Rio isn’t overly sure if that is something he is sensing or just something he is saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “The strongest,” Rio says, believing that, and as she says that she notices the way Nicky is looking around. “Nicky?” Rio asks concerned, once again fearing that she has made a mistake by bringing him to this place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we stay here a little while Mom? I feel Mama here,” Nicky admits, and Rio is sure that that is because of the connection their magick shares, something she can’t completely understand even though she has tried.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, we could even stay in Salem a little while if you’d like,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Nicky asks, looking excited at the possibility.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, why not? There were posters in the town about a costume Halloween party next week, we can at least stay for that,” Rio says, as while Salem isn’t her favourite place she can tell that it’s important to Nicky that they spend time in Salem.
    </p>
<p>
     “Awesome,” Nicky says with a grin, getting an idea. “Mom, you have to dress up as the Grim Reaper for the party! It would be perfect,” Nicky says to her and Rio laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll see,” Rio says as she puts an arm around Nicky and kisses the top of his head as the two of them drift into silence as they stand together in the place that has so much significance for them, and their family.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For over a week Rio and Nicky have been staying in Salem, staying in a house that Rio made sure was as far away as possible from the land where Agatha’s childhood home once stood, and it has been clear how much Nicky has enjoyed staying in this particular location.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio would have happily left by now, she has been able to tell that it means a lot to Nicky to be in a place where he can ‘feel’ his mother and because of that they have stayed for longer than Rio has intended, something she now regrets considering what she has just discovered.
    </p>
<p>
     Knowing that every second is counts, and that they need to get moving quickly, Rio is hurrying into the room Nicky is sleeping in and quickly tries to wake him up. “Nicky, Nicky, wake up,” Rio says as she shakes her son awake.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks, as he wakes up, feeling confused about why his mother would wake him up in the middle of the night.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got go move, right now, grab anything you don’t want to leave behind,” Rio says, as she picks up the picture of Agatha that Nicky keeps next to whatever bed he is sleeping in, and puts it into the bag she is holding, having no intention of leaving that behind.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, what…” Nicky starts to say as he sits up, but then he notices the look on Rio’s face. “You’re scared,” Nicky says shocked, as the only other times he has seen his mother screed was when he was sick and when he died.

     </strong>
     Thank you for the support. I hope you like this chapter. Please let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Yeah, Nicky, I am,” Rio says, as she realises that the only way to make sure Nicky moves as quickly as they need to, that he takes the precautions they need to take, is if she explains a little about what is going on, and because of that she sits down on the edge of his bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t think you ever got scared,” Nicky admits, knowing things must be pretty bad for his mother to actually be scared.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do sometimes,” Rio admits, as the biggest thing that scares her is the thought of something happening to Nicky or Agatha. “Nicky there are people, witches, and other powerful beings in the world who would very much like to hurt me or Mama,” Rio explains, wanting to give the most efficient explanation possible so they can get moving. “Some of those most dangerous people are a coven known as the Salem Seven,” Rio explains, wanting him to know the name of the coven but knowing they don’t have time to give the full explanation. “I’ve heard whispers, they’re here, in Salem, and they’re looking for us,” Rio explains, knowing that technically they are just looking for Nicky, who they don’t know for sure is him yet, but they suspect, and if they are after her son they are after her too. “So, we need to go,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mom,” Nicky says, understanding enough to know that what is going on is bad.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, we’re going to be run a lot, and I am going to do everything I can to protect you, so if I tell you to do something you need to do it, no arguing” Rio explains, knowing she will do whatever she has to do to protect Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can do that,” Nicky assures.
    </p>
<p>
     “And unless you have no other option you cannot use your magick, unless you need to protect yourself, you cannot blast,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?” Nicky asks confused, as his mother has never told him not to use his magick before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because right now the Salem Seven just have their suspicions about who you are, but if you use your magick on them, they will know for sure, and they will never stop looking for you,” Rio says, knowing that they will know who Nicky is for sure if they see his magick because of the connection his magick has with Agatha’s and also knowing that she cannot let that happen as if they know for sure they will never give up. “Do you understand?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand Mom,” Nicky confirms, not saying that he knows that if he needs to he will use his magick to protect his mother without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go, let’s go, now,” Rio tells her son and the two of them quickly pack up the things they can’t leave behind before running out of the house, Rio carrying Nicky as while she knows she cannot teleport with her son she can run quicker than a human which right now is their best option.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After over an hour of carrying her son as she runs Rio finds herself feeling very glad that it takes a lot to tire herself out, but she also feels beyond frustrated with the Salem Seven.
    </p>
<p>
     Due to her status as ‘the’ green witch Rio is using the fact that they are running through a forest to her advantage and doing everything she can to create obstacles to prevent the feral Coven from following them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, south,” Nicky says, being able to sense that that is where someone is coming, from and without even questioning her son Rio uses her magick to cause vines to come up from the ground, grabbing hold of the coven member. “Cool,” Nicky says amazed then his face gets a scared look. “Blast incoming,” Nicky tells his mother, and a second later Rio sees a blast coming towards them and while she is able to block most of the force it does still knock her off her feet, causing Nicky to roll onto the ground, and the bag she is carrying to fall on the ground next to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stay down,” Rio says, before speaking a language Nicky has heard his mother use before, but words which he doesn’t understand, which creates a protection ‘bubble’ around him, something which Rio knows won’t last long, but to pull of what she is planning she knows it doesn’t have to.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Nicky is as safe as he can be, at least temporarily, Rio takes several steps away from her son, not wanting to be close to him when she does what she is about to do, and draws on her concentration, her power.  Muttering a language that not another being speaks Rio lifts her arms, brings them to her chest, then pushes them out, and as she does an incredible force of magick is released from her, a force that even Nicky can tell is strong.
    </p>
<p>
     In the seconds that follow Rio letting out an incredibly strong force the magick echoes throughout the forest and causes every living thing, except for Nicky who is protected, and Rio herself, to be made dormmate either, in the case of human or animal being made unconscious, or in the case of any other living thing being made dormmate.
    </p>
<p>
     After releasing her power Rio has to spend a few seconds collecting herself, as there is a reason she only does that as a last resort, before walking over to her son, who can practically ‘feel’ the power radiating off her, something he has never felt before.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, Nicky,” Rio says as the protection around her son falls.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mommy, that was…. Amazing,” Nicky says to his mother, with an amazed look on his face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Glad you think so,” Rio says, squatting down in front of him. “Are you okay?” Rio asks, knowing that while they have to get moving again soon, they do have enough time for her to check to make sure her son is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so…. My arm hurts a little,” Nicky admits, still feeling in awe of his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me see,” Rio says, and Nicky sticks out his arm. As soon as Nicky sticks out his arm Rio sees that he has a decent cut on it, something which likely happened as he fell to the ground. “Oh, that’s nothing, I can fix that right up,” Rio says, as she lifts Nicky’s arm to her mouth and places gentle kisses along the wound on her son’s arm, using her own healing ability to heal it. “Better?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, thank you Mom,” Nicky says to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, them let’s get out of here,” Rio says before picking up her son and the bag that were dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to be okay after doing that, Mom?” Nick asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “With time,” Rio admits, as she will need some time to recover from what she just did, and she is going to be a little weaker for a little while. “But that doesn’t matter what now, what matters is getting to safety,” Rio says, and she once again pushes herself to run while she carriers her son knowing that the Salem 7 won’t be able to follow, at least not for a while.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Across the world the person Nicky and Rio want to see most, Agatha Harkness, is sitting alone in a basement studying the Darkhold, as she obsessively reads, flicking the pages with her blackened fingers, she feels a force so strong that she has to stop what she is doing as she tries to catch her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Agatha mutters, being able to identify exactly who is the source of the magick, as she knows it just as well as she knows her own, and for a brief second she finds herself wondering just what her estranged wife is up to. “Not my problem,” Agatha says, as she doesn’t want to see Rio, doesn’t want to deal with her, even if a part of her can’t help but wonder if she is okay, but she pushes those feelings down and instead goes back to reading the book that calls to her having no idea that if she were to investigate what she just felt she would find exactly what she is searching the Darkhold for.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Days have passed since Rio woke up Nicky in the middle of the night due to the Salem Seven and ever since she and Nicky have been running. While Rio has been doing her best to limit how many times, they stop it has been necessary to stop more than she would like due to the effects the magick she performed has on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Gaining access to a house in Alaska Rio knows that they need to take time to rest, even if she would prefer to keep going and as neither she nor Nicky have sensed anything that tells them that the Salem Seven are still following them since they left Massachusetts, she knows it’s time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we going to stay here?” Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “For a little while,” Rio says, knowing that she desperately needs a few hours to rest before they can move on again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we safe here, Mom?” Nicky asks, and Rio tenses, knowing they have to have a difficult conversation, one she was hoping they wouldn’t have to have to have until Nicky was a little older, but now that the Salem Seven are in play she knows it’s time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s sit down, Nicky,” Rio says to her son, and she leads him over the couch, where they both sit down. “Nicky, you know I am always going to do whatever I have to do to keep you safe, and that when we find Mama she will to?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish, and I know Mama would too, that I could promise you that you’d always be safe, but the truth is I can’t,” Rio tells her son. “Because of who you are, because of who we all are and what we can do, we’re always going to be in danger, always going to have people who hate us, who want to hurt us,” Rio tells her son, knowing that there is a few different layers to that, but it’s not the time to address that. “Me, and Mama when we find her, are always going to do whatever we have to do to keep you safe. We’ll give everything we are to making sure you are okay, but even with how powerful we are there are things we can’t prevent, things we can’t keep from happening or protect you from,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like when I died,” Nicky says, and Rio has to fight back tears at that reminder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly like that,” Rio says, fighting to keep her voice even. “But that doesn’t mean we’re going to give up, it doesn’t mean we’re going to stop trying to protect you, it just means that sometimes we have to fight a little harder,” Rio admits, before leaning forward. “But you know what, I have been fighting for Mama for over three hundred years, I’m not going to stop now, and neither of us will ever stop fighting for you,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to fight for you and Mama too,” Nicky promises his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you will,” Rio says, smiling slightly. “That’s exactly what we have to keep doing, Nicky, keep fighting for each other, keep fighting for our family, to be safe, and if we do that maybe, just maybe we can keep ahead of the people who want to hurt us and have longer moments where we are safe,” Rio says to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we can do it,” Nicky says. “You, me, Mama, we’re strong,” Nicky says to Rio, who once again wonders if Nicky can ‘sense’ magick as that’s what it is beginning to seem like to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we are,” Rio confirms. “I’m going to put the protects up around the house, do you want to learn how I do it?” Rio asks, having realised that she needs Nicky to know how to protect himself in this way just in case she is ever not around to do it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky says and together mother and son perform ancient, powerful, magick designed to keep them safe while Rio regains her strength.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      December 2019
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Rio and Nicky ran from the Salem Seven and to Rio’s relief there hasn’t been anything that indicates they might still be following them. As she knows they cannot afford to get complacence Rio is still moving them frequently, trying to put as much distance between them and Salem as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do you think?” Rio asks as she leads her son into a beach shack, in Bali, that has been abandoned since Thanos snapped his fingers, which is where they are going to be saying at least for a little while. “I know it means we’re not going to have snow for Christmas, but I think we can have some fun here,” Rio comments, and as she does, she notices that just as he has been for a little while Nicky is uncharacteristically silent. “Nicky, what’s going on, Mi Conejito? What are you thinking?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just…” Nicky starts to say as he looks around. “Mom, are we ever going to have a real home?” Nicky asks, as while they go back to the cottage a lot even that doesn’t completely feel like home.
    </p>
<p>
     “We will, when we find Mama, we’ll have a home together,” Rio tells her son, knowing that while she and Agatha may have a lot to work through, they will both make sure to give Nicky a home. “I know moving so much makes it difficult to feel settled, and I’m sorry about that, but I don’t know another way to keep us safe, to make sure our enemies don’t find us. I don’t know another way to try to find Mama when she is so hidden,” Rio explains, feeling guilty about the effect that everything is starting to have on Nicky, feeling worried that she has made a mistake with how she handles things.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know why we have to keep moving, I understand that,” Nicky admits. “I just... wish that everywhere we go didn’t feel so foreign,” Nicky admits, and as he does Rio gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about when we get to a new place, we make sure we always do the exact same thing first,” Rio suggest. “We can make sure we do something to make it feel a little less foreign, to make it more familiar, more comfortable for us,” Rio suggest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like what?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits, as she didn’t think that far. “What do you think? What would help you feel more comfortable in a place?” Rio asks her son, who looks like he is pondering the question for a few moments.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about the first thing we do when we get to a new place is cook something, a meal we share,” Nicky suggests, as since coming back to life he has read a lot of books about cooking as it isn’t something Rio is overly good at, because she has never needed to be, so he wanted to make sure he was.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think that’s a brilliant idea,” Rio says, smiling at her son. “Let’s find the kitchen,” Rio says and together the two of them explore the house until they find a kitchen where they get started on their new tradition.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      February 2020
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Rio and Nicky created a new tradition for when they get to a new place and ever since they have continued to do their tradition of cooking a meal being the first thing they do whenever they get to a new place.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s late afternoon and Rio is doing what she has been doing for a while and watching Nicky practice blasting with his magick, using telekinesis, and levitating, resulting in the backyard of the house they are staying in being pretty covered in his very unique magic. As she has been watching him for a while, partly because she wanted to make sure he didn’t accidently hurt himself Rio has realised something they have to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, can you stop for a minute?” Rio asks her son as she walks towards him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky responds, and he makes the various magic things he is doing disappear. “Am I doing something wrong?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio assures him, gesturing to the ground for them to sit. “But I can’t help but notice that you’re not practicing with your magick in a way you usually would,” Rio admits, as they both sit down. “There’s no books, you’re not studying, and I can’t help but wonder why,” Rio admits, and Nicky avoids looking at her. “Nicky, talk to me,” Rio asks in a gentle voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to study, I love learning about magick, I want to understand as much as possible,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “But?” Rio asks her son, gently encouraging him to explain more.
    </p>
<p>
     “But studying isn’t going to help if we’re attacked again,” Nicky admits. “I know the danger we’re in Mom, and want to be stronger, I want to be able to protect myself a little, I don’t want you to worry about me as much,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m always going to worry about you, I’m your mom, it’s my job,” Rio admits, knowing that out of her jobs it’s the one she prefers. “If your Mama was here right now, she would tell you that the best way to be stronger is to gain more knowledge,” Rio tells her son. “She would say that strength and power only come from truly understanding the craft,” Rio admits. “I never understood what she meant by that, but she did, and I could tell it was important,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I know,” Nicky admits. “I do miss studying, I want to learn more, I want to learn everything I can, including languages, I just wanted to be able to help if the Salem Seven attack again,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me handle the Salem Seven,” Rio tells her son, knowing that for now her strategy of moving frequently and placing death runes to protect the location they are in seems to be keeping them hidden, but she can’t guarantee how long it will continue to. “All I want you to do is whatever you want to do, okay?” Rio asks her son. “If that means studying magick you do that, if that means destroying the kitchen because you want to spend hours cooking then do that, do what you want to do Nicky, not what you think you need to do,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if what I want to do right now is learn languages?” Nicky asks his mother, who grins.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then I’d say that’s definitely something I can help with,” Rio tells her son. “Lay back,” Rio says, and Nicky does just that.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Nicky is lying on the ground, looking up at the sky, Rio uses her green witch magick to cause fines, flowers, and ivy out of the ground, creating a gazebo over them.
    </p>
<p>
     “So cool,” Nicky says amazed as Rio lays down next to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you’d interested there is a very old, very special, language that I would like to teach you,” Rio tells her son, as she always imagined being able to pass on her knowledge of a particular language to her son. “You interested?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very,” Nicky responds, and Rio proceeds give a language lesson she once dreamed of one day giving her son.

<p>
<strong>
      May 2020
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     About three months have passed since Rio told Nicky to do whatever he wants to do while she keeps them safe and ever since he has taken that to heart, spending most of his time studying every magickal book Rio is about to get him while also learning languages and cooking. In fact, he has become so interested in his studies that most nights he falls asleep with a book in his hands. While Nicky may not be attending a traditional school or be studying things that are usually taught to someone his age, it can’t be argued that he isn’t getting an education.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though it is late at night Nicky isn’t asleep, in fact he isn’t even reading, rather he is walking around the house he and Nicky have been staying at in Brazil.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are you?” Nicky mutters, feeling worried as his mother left to do her job and has been gone for an unusually long time. While he has gotten pretty good at holding it together while his mother is off doing what she has to do this time feels different, and he can’t help but feel terrified about where she could be. “Okay Nicky, relax, Mom is literally death, nothing can hurt death, nothing can prevent death, nothing can kill death… right?” Nicky asks himself, being able to feel the uncertainty he is feels about that.  “No, we’re not going there,” Nicky says, before closing his eyes and taking several deep breaths. “Mom doesn’t have a phone so I can’t call,” Nicky says, trying to think of a way to get in contact with his mother to find out if she is okay as he knows that after almost two years of not being able to find his Mama he cannot lose his mom. “I could break the protection,” Nicky suggests. “No, she’d freak out,” Nicky admits, as he looks around the room, trying to figure out what to do, taking notice of the clock. “Twelve hours until drastic action,” Nicky decides. “Until then…. Distraction,” Nicky decides. “But just what distraction,” Nicky mutters. “Baking… cupcakes for when Mom gets home,” Nicky decides, before heading to the kitchen, tyring to focus on what he is going to do but his mind I solely on his mama and where she could be.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea that Nicky is so worried about her, though she suspects he might be considering how long she has returned, Rio is finally arriving back at the house in Brazil Nicky has been staying in and as she walks into the house the first thing, she realises is that she smells a lot of food. Walking though the house she quickly finds the source of the smell, the fact that the dining table is covered in food and Nicky is in the kitchen clearly cooking more food.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Rio says, and the second she speaks Nicky turns around and the second he sees his mom he looks thrilled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom!” Nicky exclaims, looking thrilled and he drops what he is doing and runs towards his mother, and once he is close enough, he hugs her tightly. “I was scared you weren’t going to come home,” Nicky says to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I’m your mom, I’m always going to come home to you,” Rio assures him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama hasn’t,” Nicky says and as she hears that Rio breaks apart from him and squats in front of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, Mama hasn’t come home because she doesn’t know you’re here to come home to,” Rio reminds Nicky. “If she knew she’d be here in a split second,” Rio assures her son. “And as for me, Nicky, I’m Death, nothing can stop me, very little can hurt me, you never have to worry about me not coming home, no matter how long I’m gone, okay?” Rio asks her son, knowing she is going to limited how long she is actually gone for to help him feel better.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says before hugging his mother once more. “I wish Mama would let us find her,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too, Nicky, me too,” Rio assures her son as she hugs him, kisses the top of his head, and the two of them hold each other until they realise the stove is on fire, so they quickly deal with that.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2020
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     About three months have passed since Rio had to be gone for longer than she expected and for the first little while Rio noticed that Nicky clung to her more when she was home but after a few weeks of her returning quickly when she left, he has been doing a lot better.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s Nicky’s tenth birthday and after starting their day with their traditional cake in bed Nicky and Rio have gone outside to the backyard of the Cottage, which is where they are staying, because Nicky wants to show his mother what he has been learning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, are you watching?” Nicky asks his mother, as he stands several steps away from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, Mi Conejito,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Nicky says, sounding glad.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next few minutes Nicky demonstrates blasting, levitating as well as several spells that he has been practicing before walking back over to where his mother is.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’ve got some pretty impressive Magick Mi Conejito,” Rio assures her son, and Nicky grins. “And I never want you to be ashamed of your power, or talent, but you need to be careful, magick can be dangerous,” Rio tells him, trying to find the delicate balance between wanting to make sure Nicky is never ashamed of his powers and wanting to make sure he is safe. “Magick can make people think you are dangerous,” Rio reminds him, thinking of Agatha and knowing that Agatha would never want what happened to her to happen to their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I’ll be careful,” Nicky assures his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says, and as she does, she gets an idea. “So, it looks like you’re starting to get a handle om your magick,” Rio says, sounding proud, before pulling her knife. “How would you feel about learning some other ways to protect yourself? Other ways to fight?” Rio asks curious, as she wants to make sure her son is a prepared as possible for what might come after him, which she knows could be a lot the biggest thing on her mind being that just because the Salem 7 haven’t caught up with them again doesn’t mean they won’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d love that,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Rio says before easily moving through the gaps in the fence so that she can stand next to her son. “We’re starting with some basic moves, then we’ll move onto knifes,” Rio tells Nicky, purposely not thinking about what Agatha would say if she knew Rio was teaching their ten-year-old son how to use knives.
    </p>
<p>
     “Awesome,” Nicky says, with a huge grin on his face, and after returning her son’s grin Rio proceeds to get started on her lesson.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      November 2020
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three months have passed since Rio started to teach Nicky other ways to defend himself and just like when learning everything else, he has dedicated everything he is to learning, to being as good as he can.
    </p>
<p>
     Having spent the last few hours taking the souls of people who died in a pretty bad skirmish, which involved a lot of kids getting caught in the crossfire, Rio is very glad to be returning home to Nicky, as that’s what she knows, that no matter how many times they have to move wherever Nicky, and Agatha, are that’s where she considers to be her home.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking into the most current house they are staying in Rio finds that once again there is a lot of food on the table, something which is surprising as she hasn’t been gone overly long.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, what’s all this?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know there are certain foods you like to eat more than others, so I thought I would make them all for you,” Nicky explains to his mother. “I wanted to do something special for you,” Nicky says and because she has a suspicion about why Nicky would feel the need to make something special for her Rio knows she needs to make sure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, why do you think I need something special?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I know you had to take a lot of people to where they needed to be today,” Nicky tells his mother, confirming what Rio suspected but that doesn’t make it any easier to hear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did,” Rio confirms, before walking over to her son and hugging him. “You’re pretty incredible, Mi Conejito, I love you so much,” Rio says hugging her son tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Love you too, Mom,” Nicky responds, and the two of them continue to stand in the room hugging as while, Rio taking comfort from her son as while she doesn’t usually find doing her job difficult when it involves children it is different; something which Nicky has obviously realises.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      March 2021
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     About four months has passed since Nicky realised his mom had a difficult time doing her job and since then it has become clear that he can, for lack of a better term, ‘sense death’ in different ways, but to Rio’s relief when it comes to knowing if a specific person is going to die, he has to touch them first.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you never told me why you wanted to come here today,” Rio tells her son as the two of them are walking through a street in Hong Kong, too close for Rio’s liking to the Hong Kong Sanctum; a place whose inhabitants she doesn’t want to be anywhere near her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “It feels like somewhere I need to be today,” Nicky admits, sounding uncertain about exactly why and because of that Rio freezes as she knows that he would be feeling that for one of two reasons. While she is surprised by her son’s words Rio only allows herself a few seconds to feel that shock before she gets her baring’s and squats down in front of her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I need you to talk to me, are you sensing that a lot of people are going to die her or that a lot of magick is going to be used here?” Rio asks her son, wanting to know exactly what they are going to be facing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Both,” Nicky answers. “I want to help,” Nicky admits, and Rio has to pause to control her reaction to that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio tells her son. “We’ve got to go,” Rio says knowing that she needs to get Nicky to safety before he decides to intervene
    </p>
<p>
     “But Mom…..” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “But nothing, we’re going,” Rio says, standing up and grabbing her son’s hand. “Now, Nicholas,” Rio tells her son, but before they can even take a few steps there is a large magickal explosion at the Sanctum, and Rio knows immediately that people have died. “Don’t even think about it,” Rio says, looking at her son and seeing the look on his face which tells her that he is about to run straight into a situation without thinking, knowing the look perfectly because she has seen an identical one on Agatha’s face countless times.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to help,” Nicky tells his mother. “I want them to know that it will be okay, that you’ll take them where they need to go,” Nicky tells his mother. “That it’s okay,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “People aren’t ready to hear that this soon after a tragedy,” Rio tells her son, experience telling her that much. “We’re going,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “But your job…” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will still need to be done once I get you to safety,” Rio says, and before he can object further, she picks up her son, something she wouldn’t be able to do if she was just a regular human, and carries him away from the magickal battle that is going on.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after she carried Nicky away from the battle the two of them, Nicky still being in Rio’s arms as she has no intention of letting him go until she is sure that he can’t follow, are arriving back at the house they are staying at.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could just follow you Mom,” Nicky says annoyed, as his mother puts him on the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you can’t,” Rio tells her son, and feeling glad that she had the foresight not to teach her son a particular protection, a particular rune, that will keep him in the house and make it so he can’t follow her, she casts it knowing that Nicky won’t be able to break it. “We’ll be talking about this when I get back,” Rio tells her son before teleporting away, and the second she goes Nicky tries to leave the house so he can follow but he quickly realises he can’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom! Mom! Damn it! I just want to reassure people,” Nicky says annoyed, before going to where he can keep his books so he can start to figure out what his mother has done to keep him where he is.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While her mind is solely on Nicky, Rio is attempting to do her job, but with every soul she fairs to the other side her mind just keeps going back to Nicky, and Agatha, to the undeniable truth that she can’t keep raising their son alone, that she needs Agatha, that Rio alone isn’t enough for Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     After Rio fairies the last soul who died to the veil, she returns to the battle, not searching for more people who she needs to fairy but trying to figure out what to do next because she honestly doesn’t know how she is going to help her son, isn’t sure what she can do for him.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking around even Rio can feel the power that has been used in location, though unlike Nicky, she can only feel it now that it has happened, something which makes her realise something.
    </p>
<p>
     “He got that from Agatha,” Rio says, coming to her realisation and as she does, she starts to get an idea. “Worth a try,” Rio says, as she has no idea what else to do, she is completely out of ideas.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking over to a wall, where there is a strong ‘sense’ of magick, Rio leaves a trace of her magick, as well as message that only Agatha would be able to find, saying; ‘
     <em>
      find me, we need to talk. It’s important’
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment Rio debates saying something about Nicky, but because she doesn’t want to risk someone else finding about it, she doesn’t, she just hopes that this magical battle was interesting enough for Agatha to come look into, and more than that she hopes that if she does Agatha doesn’t ignore the message; something which she knows is a long shot.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please Agatha, please, stop hiding,” Rio says, as a tear comes to her eyes, having a desperate need to see her again. “I can’t keep doing this without you,” Rio admits, and after spending a few moments collecting herself, as she doesn’t want Nicky to realise that she is sad, Rio makes her way back to where she left her son.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Arriving at the house Rio lifts the protection she put in place to keep Nicky where he was and makes her way inside, considering the way they left things Rio isn’t at all surprised to find that Nicky isn’t there to great her in the way he usually would.
    </p>
<p>
     With a sigh Rio takes a few calming breaths, getting a feeling that she is going to need it for this particular conversion, and heads into the room that Nicky has been staying and considering the way she knows her son can be like Rio isn’t at all surprised to find him sitting on the ground, surrounded by books.
    </p>
<p>
     “You still mad at me?” Rio asks from the doorway, suspecting that if he can hold a grudge like his Mama then he will be.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes… no…. I don’t know,” Nick admits, and feeling that that is as good of an answer that she is going to get Rio walks over to him and finds a place among the books to sit down. “I just wanted to help,” Nicky tells his mother. “I knew there was a lot of magick, and that people were going to die, that nothing could change that, but I thought I still thought I could help, give them some peace,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not your responsibility, Mi Conejito,” Rio tells her son. “I am so proud of you for wanting to help, but Nicky you cannot keep things this serious from me, you cannot manipulate what we do like you just did,” Rio tells her son. “Nicky, we were near an organization who would try to make you conform to their version of magick if they knew about you, there was incredible amounts of power released, and it was being used in dangerous ways, if you tried to use your magcks people could realise who you are, you have no idea how dangerous what you just did is,” Rio tells her son, trying to keep her voice even, but feeling completely terrified that her son was going to do something so dangerous without thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t the danger worth it if I could help people?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not to me,” Rio tells her son. “Nicky, I can’t lose you again,” Rio says, her voice breaking, knowing that even with how powerful she is that is something she couldn’t survive a second time. “Please, if you feel something like this again talk to me first, and we’ll figure out what to do, together,” Rio say, and Nicky can tell how upset his mother is becoming at that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mom,” Nicky says, before leaning forward and hugging his mother, realising that he scared her. “I’ll talk to you next time,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says as she hugs her son, kissing the top of his head, as she holds her son close, desperately hoping that Agatha gets her message, while Nicky has no idea what he can do to help his mom who is clearly not okay.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2021
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     About five months have passed since Nicky was able to sense a deadly magic battle before it happened and since then he hasn’t experienced anything just like that but what he has realised is what something else he is sensing is. As well as realising that he is sensing Nicky, who has recently turned eleven, has also realised that his mother is struggling that she is not okay, and he knows that the only thing that would be able to help her is finding Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Having just finished escorting an elderly couple, who died within moments of each other, to the veil Rio is just returning to the latest house they are living in. Walking into the house Rio finds Nicky sitting in the middle of the living room in a meditation pose.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Rio asks hesitantly, not seeing any magic around him so she isn’t certain exactly what her son is doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Mom,” Nicky says, opening his eyes, and when he does Rio sees a flicker of blue.
    </p>
<p>
     “What were you just doing?” Rio asks curious, and as she asks her question, she can tell that Nicky is nervous to answer. “Nicky, you can talk to me, always, no matter what,” Rio assures her son, as she walks over and sits down on the floor in front of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky says as he is sure that no matter what he can always talk to his mom. “I just… I just don’t want to make you sadder than you already are,” Nicky admits, and Rio is surprised by that as while she has been sad lately, she thought she was doing a good job at keeping it form Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you think I’m, sad Mi Conejito?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I heard you crying,” Nicky admits. “I know you miss Mama; I know it hurts you to know we can’t find her, that we can’t be together,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “It does,” Rio admits. “Nicky I am doing everything I can to find Mama, but sometimes knowing we can’t find her, knowing everything you two are missing out on because I can’t, it hurts,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s why I’m trying to help,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, what are you trying to do?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve always felt something, it feels familiar, safe, and it’s something that I have always just felt, like it’s apart of me,” Nicky explains, having no idea if the explanation is making sense, but it is the best explanation he can give. “After Hong Kong I realised what it is I’m feeling, it’s Mama,” Nicky reveals, smiling fondly. “It’s the connection our magic shares, she’s always been with me, and I didn’t even realise,” Nicky says, feeling comforted by that thought, not knowing that the only reason Agatha isn’t feeling the same thing is the Darkhold’s influence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, do you know where she is?” Rio asks, feeling hope that maybe they are closer to finding Agatha than she released.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m sorry Mom,” Nicky admits. “That’s what I have been trying to do, getting enough focus so that I can find Mama, but I can’t tell where she is, all I can tell is that she is out there,” Nicky admits, not realising that like his mom his ability to find his mama is being hampered by the Darkhold, and its influence. “I’m so sorry Mom,” Nicky admits, feeling that he is letting his mother down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Mi Conejito, you have nothing to apologize for, okay, absolutely nothing,” Rio assures her son before hugging him tight, feeling amazed at what he is trying to do. “We’ll figure it out, we’ll find her, I know we will,” Rio says, that being something she needs to believe right now, and for a moment mother and son just hold each other, both feeling the missing piece that should be with them.

As I am once again doing night shifts for the next little while I will be updating chapters at this time, and in about twelve hours from now, except for Thursday morning my time where I won't be updating a chapter as it is the day the new episode comes out and am I am not working that morning.

<strong>
      February 2022
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Six months have passed since Nicky first tried to use his magic to figure out where his mother is, something he has continued to regularly try but due to the Darkhold, something he doesn't know, he hasn't been able to. What Nicky does know is that he keeps failing and from his perspective it feels like he is just letting his moms down, something which Rio frequently assures him isn't the case but witch he cannot believe.
    </p>
<p>
     After his latest attempt at trying to determine where his Mama is failed Nicky felt the need to escape the small house in Poland he and his mom have been staying in, he felt the need to be around actual people, and because of that he did something he has never done before, he lowered the protections his mother puts around the house when she's not home, and left.
    </p>
<p>
     Heading into the nearby village Nicky spends a few hours just being around regular people, he plays games at a little fair that is going on, and he even goes on a couple of rides. Despite what it may seem like after what he did Nicky has enough sense to know that he can't stay away from where his mother will expect to find him for long.
    </p>
<p>
     Returning to the house Nicky suspects that he may have just gotten away with leaving the protection without his mother realizing when just as he is about to open the front door his mother appears not too far away.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi Mom," Nicky greats, trying to figure out if his mother realized he lowered the protections.
    </p>
<p>
     "You sound just like your Mama when you use that tone of voice," Rio informs Nicky, immediately feeling suspicious about what he was up to.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Nicky says with a grin, considering it a compliment. "I was thinking we could make hamburgers for dinner, what do you think?" Nicky asks his mother curious, clearly trying to change the subject to distract her from realizing what he did to the protections.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think we're going to have a chat about why you lowered the protections," Rio tells her son. "Sit," Rio says, gesturing to the stairs, and Nicky sits down. "What's going on?" Rio asks his son, not moving straight to reminding her son why that was such a bad idea because she wants to hear his reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just… felt a little stir crazy and that I needed to be around other people," Nicky admits. "I know it was dangerous to lower the protections, to leave, but I just… needed not to be alone for a little while, I needed to do something around other people," Nicky admits, having no idea how his mother is going to respond to that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky, I'm sorry," Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why are you apologizing?" Nicky asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I'm keeping you away from the entire world," Rio tells her son. "I do need to keep you safe; I will do anything I can to do that, but I've forgotten that living means actually doing things that make you feel alive," Rio admits, feeling worried that she has been focusing so much on protecting Nicky that she forgets that. "Nicky sometimes because of who I am I don't think about the fact that humans need contact with other humans, that you will need to spend time with people, and I'm sorry about that," Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay Mom, I'd say you're doing a pretty good job at considering things for me that you don't have to consider for yourself," Nicky assures his mother, who knows that this is just another example of why they need Agatha, who so far has continued to ignore the messages Rio has left her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Rio says, not overly sure she can forgive herself even if Nicky understands. "So, how about instead of having dinner here tonight we go find a place in town to have it," Rio suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'd like that," Nicky responds. "If you're interested there is a fair in town, with an annoying game, I was trying and failing to win something at," Nicky tells his mother, knowing he was very close to trying magic. "Do you want to give it a try?" Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sure," Rio says with a smirk. "I don't know if I've told you, but Death always wins the game," Rio tells her son as they both stand up, Nicky laughing as he does.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was pretty lame, Mom," Nicky informs her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I thought it was pretty great," Rio responds, as the two of them head towards the village together, where they proceed to spend time at the fair, where Nicky is sure his mother cheated at games, before having dinner.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2022
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Almost six months have passed since Rio realized Nicky needs to actually spend time with regular people and ever since she has been doing her best to find a balance between what is necessary to protect him and what is necessary for his wellbeing.
    </p>
<p>
     It is Nicky's twelve birthday and Rio is once again thinking about how it's something else Agatha is missing, something which Rio only blames herself for because she hates that she is meant to be all powerful and yet she can't find Agatha because of a damn book.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, are you going to tell me where we are going anytime soon?" Nicky asks his mother as after their usual birthday tradition of eating birthday cake in bed Rio rushed them into the car and the two of them have been driving for a while.
    </p>
<p>
     "You'll see soon," Rio tells her son, as she continues to drive them through a California highway in the white convertible she obtained for this special occasion.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay," Nicky responds, looking around.
    </p>
<p>
     "Trust me, Mi Conejito, you're gonna have a great time," Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do trust you, Mom, always," Nicky says, smiling at his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     For another fifteen or so minutes Rio continues to drive and while Nicky is confused about where they are going his confusion lifts when he sees exactly where they are going.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're going to Six Flags, Magic Mountain?" Nicky asks amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yep," Rio confirms. "I thought we could have some fun, see if there are any rollercoasters that are actually scary," Rio admits, knowing that both of them very much enjoy doing things that some point would consider them being 'thrill seekers'.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sounds like a plan," Nicky says with a grin. "Can I ride anything?" Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     "As long as you meet the height requirements," Rio tells Nicky, not expecting that to be a problem, but wanting to make that exception clear as she won't let him do something that isn't safe for him.
    </p>
<p>
     "Awesome," Nicky says with a grin, and the two of them proceed to celebrate Nicky's birthday by riding as many scary rides as possible.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      December 2022
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Four months have passed since Nicky's twelve birthday and while Rio is trying to keep it together, it is clear that they are both struggling more with the fact that they haven't been able to find Agatha. While Rio is blaming herself because she feels like she is letting down both Agatha and Nicky, Nicky is blaming himself because he can feel the connection his magic shares with Agatha and yet he still can't feel where she is; something he doesn't realize isn't his fault.
    </p>
<p>
     It's late and Rio is returning to Nicky after doing her job. Just like she does every time she returns Rio goes straight to the room where Nicky is sleeping to make sure he is okay. As quietly opens the door to the room Nicky is in Rio finds that he is not sleeping like he usually would be, but rather he is lying in bed, crying.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky?" Rio asks, worried, as she quicky turns on the light and walks over to him. "Nicky, talk to me," Rio says in a gentle voice as she sits down on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're not going to find Mama are we?" Nicky asks, voicing what he has been fearing for a while, as he looks at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I… honestly… I don't know," Rio admits, it breaking her heart to say that. "I know we're not going to give up, and I know what I believe," Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's that?" Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     "That Mama and I have been pulling off impossible things, both together and apart, for over three hundred years, and because of that I believe we're going to find her," Rio admits. "I just don't know if we're going to find her soon, but that being said I truly believe we will find her," Rio tells Nicky, not sure if she is causing Nicky harm by being so optimistic about finding Agatha, but she doesn't want him to give up hope because she knows she never will.
    </p>
<p>
     "I want to believe….. I just really want Mama," Nicky admits, his voice breaking, tears rolling down his face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Me too," Rio says, pulling Nicky up and into her arms, and holding him tight as Nicky breaks down in in her arms, Rio feeling angry that Agatha is still hidden from them, heartbreak that Nicky is so upset, and also her own heartbreak about the fact that they haven't been able to find Agatha even though they have been searching for almost five years.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      May 2023
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Five months have passed since Nicky broke down in his mother's arms because he is losing hope about finding Agatha again and while he is trying to have the same optimism as his mom, he is finding it a little harder to believe that they will find her.
    </p>
<p>
     Having spent a few hours doing her job during the day rather than at night, something which Rio doesn't like to do often, she is returning home to the house she and Nicky are staying at in Wales.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky?" Rio asks, as she returns home and sees no sing of him, and she can feel that the protections were lowered. "NICHOLAS VIDAL-HARKNESS?" Rio yells through the house, panic rising up inside of her, and as she does, she notices a piece of paper on the table. Hurrying over to the note Rio quickly picks it up so she can read it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Mom,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Don't worry, I'm fine. There's a library two miles south that has an amazing collection of occult books. I don't know if they are actually real books, but I needed to check. I'm okay, I have the knife you gave me, and I will pay attention to everything around me. Hope your job wasn't too hard. Love you,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Nicky
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Damn it, Nicky," Rio mutters, as while she appreciates Nicky's desire to know more, and she knows he want to learn as much as possible she can't help but worry as she knows how much danger her son is in.
    </p>
<p>
     Needing to know that her son is okay Rio drops the note Nicky left and goes running out of the house, wanting to get to the library as quickly as possible, as while she knows she has done everything she can to make sure Nicky can protect himself she can't help but worry about him.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Not long after she arrived home to find Nicky gone Rio is arriving at the library and while her magick doesn't connect to Nicky in the same way Nicky and Agatha's magicks are connected as soon as she walks into the library Rio knows where he is.
    </p>
<p>
     Following the feeling Rio finds Nicky sitting in a corner of the library surrounded by books, clearly concentrating hard, and as she sees him Rio has to pause for a second because she can't help but reminded of just how much he looks like Agatha when he is like that.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling relieved that Nicky is seemingly okay Rio spends a few moments watching her son before walking over to him, sitting down next to him, putting her legs up on the table as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi Mom," Nicky greats.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't hi mom me, what were you thinking?" Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     "I left a note," Nicky says in his defense.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not good enough," Rio tells him. "Nicky, if you want to go somewhere while I'm gone you need to tell me first, okay, unless I have a very good reason I won't say no. I need to know where you are so I don't arrive home and panic because I can't find you and then I think that the Salem Seven or one of our other enemies have gotten to you," Rio explains, as that's where her mind went to when she couldn't find Nicky, that something awful had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't think of it like that," Nicky admits, feeling bad, as he realizes he should have. "Sorry Mom, I'll tell you next time," Nicky says to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Rio says relieved. "So, found anything interesting?" Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe," Nicky says, searching the books he was reading to pick up a specific one which he shows Rio. "Was this Mama?" Nicky asks, as he hands the book to Rio, who quickly reads something that happened in 1780.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, it was," Rio says with a laugh, remembering what happened and after checking to make sure no one is nearby to overhear Rio proceeds to tell her son the story, at least the PG version of the story.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      October 2023
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Five months have passed since Nicky and Rio agreed that Nicky could go places when she is doing her job but only if they talked about it first and in in that Nicky has turned thirteen and Rio has made even more of an effort to leave messages for Agatha trying to get her to contact her, something which Agatha hasn't done yet.
    </p>
<p>
     As she has just felt the feeling of five Infinity Stones being used at the same time for the second time in her existence Rio is once again feeling the universe in chaos, but that is nothing compared to the fear she is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Stopping what she is doing mid-job Rio makes her way back to the Cottage as quickly as possible as she has only one thing on her mind as she feels everyone who were snapped away five years ago come back.
    </p>
<p>
     "NICKY!" Rio yells as she hurries into the house, being able to hear her heart beating in her ears, feeling terrified that because those who were lost five years ago were brought back her son who she was able to get back because of the chaos will be taken away again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom?" Nicky asks, running out of the bedroom. "Are you okay?" Nicky asks, but he has barely gotten the question out before his mother is pulling him into his her arms, holding him tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, I'm okay," Nicky assures her. "I haven't gone anywhere," Nicky assures her. "You're worried because of that power surge, aren't you?" Nicky asks, as that's what he assumes.
    </p>
<p>
     "You felt that?" Rio asks worried, as she breaks apart from her son to look at him, not overly surprised because she knows that Nicky can sense magic, but considering how strong it was for her she is worried about the effect it would have on her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, it was… lot… overwhelming…. It felt like I couldn't breathe for a few second," Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm really sorry you felt that," Rio admits and as she does, because of what she is feeling bubbling below her surface she knows what she has to do, but she cannot do it alone. "Nicky, I need your help," Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, Mom," Nicky says to her. "What do you need?" Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's about to be a lot of death, a huge battle that will include a lot of magic. So, I need your help to cast a spell that will temporarily make this cottage out of phase with reality, that way I can do my job without being overwhelming and that will allow me to focus without being affected by the chaos that is currently going on, and that may happen again if whoever has the infinity stones use them again," Rio explain. "It will protect you from both what you can sense and anything else that happens," Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can help," Nicky assures his mother, being able to tell how serious this is.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Rio tells her son, feeling grateful. "Here's what we have to do," Rio says before starting to explain to her son exactly what they are going to do, something which they are the only ones who can do as they are the only two beings, in the universe, who speak the language they need to use.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      November 2023
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Just over three weeks have passed since everyone who snapped away was brought back and both Rio and Nicky are dealing with the effects of that. Rio is dealing with more work as the entire world is in chaos once again, while Nicky is still feeling a little overwhelmed due to the effects that sensing infinity stones being used more than once had on him; despite Rio's attempt to prevent that with the spell they cast.
    </p>
<p>
     It's early morning at the cottage, where Rio and Nicky have been staying since the blip, as it's being called, and the two of them are having breakfast together.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you have more of an appetite today?" Rio asks her son, still trying to understand just what effects sensing the infinity stones being used multiple times is having on her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "A little, but not much," Nicky admits. "I do feel like I'm getting more energy back," Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good that's good," Rio says, and once she does both, she and Nicky feel the exact same thing at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio says, with an amazed look on her face, bringing her hand up to her heart, at the exact same time Nicky says, "Mama,".

     </strong>
     : Thank you for the absolutely amazing response to the last chapter. I hope I live up to your expectations, I’m a little nervous. Please let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “You can feel Mama too?” Nicky asks his mother, as while he has gotten used to being able to feel his mother that feeling just got a whole lot stronger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio says, feeling amazed as it is has been so long since she has been able to feel Agatha, and it has truly felt like she lost a part of herself when she stopped being able to feel her, but now she feels like she has gotten that piece back. “I know where she is,” Rio says, knowing this is everything she has wanted, but as she feels that she also feels something else. “Something’s not right,” Rio realises, her face falling, feeling dread rise up inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, is she….” Nicky starts to ask as even he can ‘feel’ that there is something off with what he is feeling, but he doesn’t know what it means, and he is scared to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s alive,” Rio says, knowing that without a doubt. “But something’s not right,” Rio admits, not sure exactly what she is feeling but knowing that whatever it is ‘less’ Agatha in a sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then let’s go,” Nicky says, standing up. “Let’s get to Mama,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not until you eat,” Rio says as while everything she is wants to go after Agatha immediately, she knows that she needs to make sure Nicky is looked after.
    </p>
<p>
     “But Mom…” Nicky starts to object.
    </p>
<p>
     “But nothing, we’re going to have to travel across the world to get to Mama, we can’t do that if you pass out because you haven’t eaten,” Rio tells her son. “Eat, then we can collect what we need and go,” Rio says, giving her son a look which Nicky has learnt to mean ‘you’re not going to fight me on this,’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Nicky says annoyed, and he reluctantly sits down and tries to eat, feeling amazed that he is finally going to get to see his mama again.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After three days of traveling, it having taken longer than either would like because Rio can’t teleport with Nicky, and she refuses to use brooms without Agatha, Rio and Nicky are finally using a car Rio has ‘obtained’ to drive into Westview New Jersey; the location they both know they will find Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, what do you think happened here?” Nicky asks, as the drive through the town centre and they see a lot of military vehicles, vehicles marked with an acronym SWORD, and as well as what he can see Nicky also feels that a lot of magic has been used.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not sure, but it has to be why Mama was here,” Rio admits, knowing that would make sense. “I know she’s here, in town, but I can’t tell exactly where she is,” Rio admits, feeling extremely concerned that she can’t tell exactly where Agatha is. “Can you?” Rio asks her son, still trying to make sense of the connection Agatha and Nicky’s magicks share.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Nicky says, shaking his head. “It’s like there’s too much interference, I have never felt anything like it,” Nicky admits, wondering just what it is that he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, we do this the old fashion way then,” Rio says, parking the car away from where the government cars are. “Come on,” Rio tells her son, and they both get out of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling curious about what his mother is going to do Nicky gets out of the car and follows Rio as she approaches two ladies who are together talking.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I am hoping you can help me,” Rio says to the ladies, putting on a very ‘panicked’ voice to try and get help as she figures it will be her best option. “I’m looking for someone very important to me, I was told she is here,” Rio explains. “He name’s Agatha, Agatha Harkness,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I don’t know anyone by that name,” The woman, Sharon Davis, says, and Rio feels her heart sink. “But that doesn’t mean she isn’t here,” Sharon explains, noticing Rio’s reaction, and wanting to make her feel better.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, um, she’s around my height, beautiful, has long dark hair, blue eyes that look like a storm,” Rio starts to explain, and Nicky can’t help but give his mother a surprised look at hearing her describe his mama like that. “Really loves the colour purple,” Rio says, knowing that there are a thousand other ways she could describe Agatha, but that seems like the best way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that sounds like Agnes!” Sharon explains, and both Rio and Nicky feel hope at that. “She helped us all,” Sharon explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Nicky asks, feeling proud.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where can I find Agnes?” Rio asks, before anyone can address what Nicky asked, being sure there is a bigger story.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s lives over on Sherwood drive, number 2804,” Sharon explains. “Um, she is having some problems knowing who she is right now,” Sharon admits, feeling the need to give that warning.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure I will be able to remind her,” Rio says, believing that, believing that, before walking away without another word.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Nicky says to Sharon before running to catch up with his mother. “Do you think whatever is causing Mama problems knowing who she is why we can’t sense her?” Nicky asks his mother in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits. “Something big has happened here,” Rio admits, looking around, as the two of them get back in the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely seems like it,” Nicky confirms, as the two of them get back into the car.
    </p>
<p>
     As it’s such a full town Rio has no problem finding Sherwood drive, and no problem finding the house, which Rio stops the car outside of, but to Nicky’s confusion even though Rio stops the car she doesn’t make an effort to get out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not going to want to see me,” Rio admits, and Nicky can tell that his mother is hurt by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t know that,” Nicky tells his mother, trying to be encouraging.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio admits, her voice breaking, as she has been so focused on getting Nicky to Agatha, she hasn’t let herself think about what it means for her and Agatha, how Agatha is going to respond to seeing her again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, what I know is that Mama is right here, we’re finally so close to being back together, you can’t let your fear hold you back now, Mom,” Nicky says, as he takes off his seatbelt an opening the door. “You coming or not?” Nicky says as he gets out of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, wait,” Rio says as she quickly gets out of the car and hurries over to where he is walking up the path. “Just let me do the talking first, okay?” Rio says, as the two of them continue to walk up the path.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “And if we start fighting, just stay out our way, it’s often how we say hello,” Rio admits, not wanting Nicky to think something is wrong, or to get in the crosshairs, if she and Agatha start fighting, something which is very strong possibility.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not even going to try to unpack that,” Nicky admits, though he has a lot of questions
    </p>
<p>
     “Good choice,” Rio tells her son, as they reach the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want me to knock?” Nicky asks, as his mother makes no effort to move towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I will,” Rio says, and she hesitantly reaches out and knocks on the door, not breaking it down like she is tempted to because she doesn’t know what to expect, and as it feels like every second lasts an eternity they wait until the door opens.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha opens the door, and Rio sees her for the first time in 153 years, Rio knows two things without a doubt, the first is that Agatha is just as beautiful as last time she saw her, and the second is the way she is dressed is very unlike Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Howdy Neighbours, can I help you?” Agatha, who unknown to Rio and Nicky is trapped under a persona of Anges O’Connor, asks in an overly friendly tone of voice, as she looks between Rio and Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Neighbours?” Rio asks confused. “Agatha, it’s me, it’s us,” Rio says to her, getting a horrible feeling deep inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry you must have me confused for someone else, I’m Agnes,” Agnes says, looking at Rio with something that she realises is worse than the hate she was expecting, a look of complete unfamiliarity.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I know exactly who you are,” Rio says, taking a step towards her. “Agatha, I know you know me, look deep inside of yourself, what we have is stronger than whatever is going on with you,” Rio says. “Please, I’m your wife, your Rio,“  Rio says, and for a split second Rio thinks she sees a look of a recognition in Agatha’s eyes, but it quickly disappears.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know who…” Agnes says, clearly confused, as she tries to move back, clearly becoming overwhelmed with whatever is going on with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m yours,” Rio says, reaching out to Agnes and as she does, she flinches away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom stop,” Nicky suddenly says, taking a step forward. “She’s under a spell,” Nicky reveals. “I can feel it,” Nicky says, squinting his eyes at Agatha as he tries to ‘see’ it in a sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Magic’s not real,” Agnes says, and those words being said by Agatha disturbs Rio more than she would admit.
    </p>
<p>
     “What does it feel like?” Rio asks Nicky, ignoring Agnes for the moment, as she realises that Agatha doesn’t have the answers she needs, Nicky does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a spider, crawling all through her, getting into every part of her,” Nicky admits, shivering as it feels completely wrong to him, which is why he isn’t sure that is the best explanation, but it is the one he is giving. “And it’s going deeper with everything you say,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to break it,” Rio says, knowing that they cannot leave Agatha in this state.
    </p>
<p>
     “I… I don’t know if I can be, I’ve never felt magic like this… it’s chaos,” Nicky admits, trying to make sense of what he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Chaos magic,” Rio mutters, knowing that sounds familiar, and it quickly comes to her as to why. “The Scarlett Witch,” Rio realises, knowing from what Agatha once told her how bad that is. “You talk to her, try to break through,” Rio tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I make it worse?” Nicky asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “It can’t get worse than this,” Rio admits, as while she was prepared for hatred, prepared to have Agatha once more say that she never wants to see her again, what she wasn’t prepared for is Agatha just not knowing them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says. “Mama?” Nicky asks, hesitantly, “It’s me, Nicky, Mom saved me, she brought me back, and I’ve missed you so much,” Nicky says, desperately hoping that the connection they share will be enough to get through and at first, it’s almost like it did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Agatha says amazed, tears coming to her eyes. “Rio,” Agatha says, looking at her with love and affection, and for a second everything seems like it is going to be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “NO!” Nicky suddenly yells, as he feels the spell Agatha is under get stronger, draw more strength from the witch who cast it, he feels it almost strangling Agatha which causes her eye to roll back into her head and for her to collapse, but as Rio is able to move so quickly, she is able to get to Agatha before she can hit the ground. “I’m sorry!” Nicky exclaims, feeling horrified at what he did. “I’m sorry!” Nicky says, blaming himself for what just happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, it’s okay, help me get her inside,” Rio says to her son as while she could carry Agatha alone without a problem, it’s something she has done before without a problem, after what just happened, she knows that Nicky needs to do something to help, and together both Nicky and Rio carry Agatha into the house. “Let’s get her to the couch,” Rio suggests, noticing that the house is very unlike Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is worse, this is so much worse!” Nicky exclaims as he and Rio gently lay Agatha on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s alive,” Rio says to Nicky, after physically checking that, not just trusting her magic. “We’ll figure this out,” Rio assures her son, turning away from Agatha for the moment to look at Nicky, needing to believe that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if we can, Mom,” Nicky admits. “I felt it, she was remembering us, she knew, and the spell got stronger. She lost conscious because the strength of the spell was fighting against how connected she is to us,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which means she is still in there, we just have to get to her,” Rio tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “How? We tried and she collapsed,” Nicky reminds her. “I can feel the spell getting stronger, the magic…. its bonding itself to her… how do we get rid of that?” Nicky asks, feeling lost as he doesn’t see how they are going to do it.
    </p>
<p>
     “By trusting that our bond is stronger,” Rio tells Nicky. “Because it is,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it? She remembered us for a second and she collapsed,” Nicky says worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s exactly my point, I’ve been fighting for Agatha for over three hundred years, I’m not going to stop now, and you can’t either,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says with a nod, though he still doesn’t understand how they are going to reverse this. “How do we get her back?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to understand the spell, understand exactly what happened here,” Rio says, as she looks around her. “Until we understand a bit more, we can’t risk trying to break the spell again, we can’t risk it getting stronger,” Rio admits, getting a feeling that it is already going to be hard enough to break the spell so they can’t make it any harder.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t abandon her to it,” Nicky objects, as while he is terrified of making things worse, he knows they can’t do that.
    </p>
<p>
     “We won’t, we’ll never leave her, Nicky,” Rio promises, and as she does Nicky sees something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Señor Scratchy?” Nicky asks amazed as he sees a rabbit who he walks over to. “It’s you, isn’t it? it’s really you,” Nicky says, as he picks up and cuddles with the rabbit he loved so dearly before he died. “How’s this possible?” Nicky asks, looking at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s easy to make certain animals immortal,” Rio explains, knowing that even though not many witches have tried. “Mama must not have wanted to say goodbye to him,” Rio says, smiling slightly as she knows that is just the kind of sentimental thing Agatha would deny ever doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad, you’ve been looking after Mama, right?” Nicky asks, as he continues to pet his pet rabbit while Rio sits down next to Agatha. “Been with her when I couldn’t be?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what happened to you, who you pissed off, but I’ll figure it out,” Rio says to Agatha, keeping her voice so low that Nicky doesn’t hear. “We’ll get you back, no matter what it takes,” Rio promises.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About an hour later Nicky and Rio are still in Agnes’s house with Agatha, who is still unconscious. While Rio is sitting next to Agatha Nicky has been doing some exploring, trying to get some answers about what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is nothing magical here, no spell books, no runes, nothing,” Nicky admits as he walks back into the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s probably because of the spell,” Rio assumes, knowing that the mere fact that the Darkhold is gone says a lot, and as she does, she starts to see the signs that tell her that Agatha is waking up, as after spending centuries watching Agatha sleep, she can always tell when she is about to wake up. “Nicky, go wait outside,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Nicky asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you don’t need to do this again,” Rio tells her son, being sure that once again being around Agatha who doesn’t remember him is just going to hurt Nicky. “Go,” Rio says, and Nicky, reluctantly heads out of the room, getting out of the room just as Agatha wakes up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who…” Agnes starts to say, when she opens her eyes and sees Rio sitting right next to her, leaning over her, clearly confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m your new neighbour,” Rio answers, as it is the first explanation she can think to give. “I saw you fall while gardening, I think you must have gotten too hot,” Rio explains, it being the first explanation she can think to give, it feeling completely wrong to lie to Agatha as it’s not something she has ever done before.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you helped me,” Agnes explains to Rio, who is smirking slightly, a smirk which Rio usually just enjoyed seeing but now just reminds her of what is missing.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was around,” Rio says, feeling a little uncomfortable, as while the person before he might look like her Agatha, she isn’t actually her Agatha. “Um, so I should go,” Rio says, as she stands up.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to,” Agnes says. “I feel like I owe you a drink,” Agnes says, as she pushes herself up so she is siting up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Raincheck,” Rio says, as this is far from the reaction she was expecting because it’s not actually Agatha it feels wrong to take her up for the offer of a drink, and what she is sure will happen after that. “I’m really glad you’re okay,” Rio says, feeling suffocated, like she cannot be around this version of Agatha for much longer. “Te Veo,” Rio says, before turning around and leaving, fighting back tears as she goes.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she is out of Agatha’s sight Rio wipes away her teers, takes several deep breaths to pull herself together, then heads out of the house, even though ever part of herself tells her to turn back around and make Agatha remember, no matter what it takes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks, once Rio is outside, and as he sees the look on his mother’s face, the look she is desperately trying to hide, Nicky walks up to her and hugs his mother tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     As mother and son stand on the step together, taking comfort from each other as they both feel heartbroken, so close to the person they have spent five years searching for, but feeling even further from her than they felt when they had no idea where she was.

     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I hope you like this chapter.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About a week has passed since Rio ad Nicky got to Westview, and while neither of them have approached Agatha again, they are moving into a house down the road from her so that they can start to figure out how they are going to handle their next approach.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s good that we were able to get a house so close,” Rio says as she and Nicky carry some stuff they have just brought into the house they are moving into, Rio knowing that the reason they were able to is because as soon as Wanda’s spell broke a lot of people decided to flee town, meaning it was easy to make this house theirs, and part of making the house feel like theirs involved Rio putting in place protections including, after a brilliant suggestion from Nicky, using the ‘left over interference’ as he calls it, from Wanda’s spell to add to the protection she put in place to help hide them. “I know it’s not ideal, but we’ll be close,” Rio says, trying to get Nicky to focus on the good as she knows that over the last week, as they research exactly what happened, Nicky has been unsurprisingly struggling. While she has also been struggling, she is trying to stay strong for her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “None of this is ideal,” Nicky admits. “I thought that when we found Mama everything would be okay, that we’d start to catch up on all the time we missed but now…” Nicky starts to say, before trailing off.
    </p>
<p>
     “It just feels like we are missing out on more time,” Rio finishes, and Nicky nods. “I know,” Rio says sadly. “Nicky, I don’t know how we’re going to fix this, I don’t know how we’re going to get Mama back, but I know that somewhere deep inside Mama is still there, and I’m not going to give up until we bring her to the surface,” Rio assures Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just hope we can,” Nicky admits, and before Rio can say anything to there is a knock on the door. “I’ll get it,” Nicky says, putting down what he is holding and heading to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as he opens the door Nicky feels shocked as he finds his mama standing on the other side, holding a gift basket, and he has no idea what to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, hi,” Nicky greats, feeling awkward even though he knows it’s his mama standing before him and he shouldn’t be because right now, because of the spell, she isn’t his mama even though he desperately wishes it was.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi there, aren’t you as cute as a button,” Agnes greats. “My name is Agnes, I wanted to welcome you to the block, I live just down the street if you ever need anything,” Agnes says to Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks…. Agnes…” Nicky says, it feeling extremely awkward for him to say that. “Would you like to come in?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I would love to, you’re so polite,” Agnes says to Nicky as she walks into the house, rustling his hair as he goes.
    </p>
<p>
     “MOM!” Nicky yells, as he really needs Rio right now, and a few seconds later Rio hurries into the room, clearly expecting something to be wrong, but she relaxes when she sees Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, hello there,” Agnes says, looking Rio up and down, clearly checking her out. “I’m Agnes, you must be this charming boy’s mom,” Agnes greats, and at those words Rio feels like she is being stabbed in the chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am,” Rio says, fighting to keep her voice even. “I’m Rio,” Rio says, searching Agnes for a sign of recognition whether because there’s some of Agatha coming through or because of their meeting a weak ago, but neither happens and it is clear that from Agnes’s point of view she has never met Rio before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s nice to meet you, Rio. Is it just the two of you in this big house?” Agnes asks, clearly fishing for information.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, if you ever get lonely, I am just down the road, my door is always open,” Agnes says as she hands Rio the basket.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll remember that,” Rio responds, being sure she will never forget. “Thank you… Agnes,”
    </p>
<p>
     “My pleasure, Rio,” Agatha responds, as Nicky looks between his mothers wondering what the looks they are exchanging means, as Agatha looks at Rio just a little too long.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agnes?” Nicky asks, resisting the urge to say Mama, as he can’t help but wonder if it means his mama is remembering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, don’t know where my mind went,” Agnes admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Rio assures her. “We haven’t really unpacked much, but would you like to stay for lunch?” Rio asks, knowing that while it might be difficult for her and Nicky it could be a way to figure out just how hard they can push against the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d lov…. I can’t,” Agnes says, both Nicky and Rio realise that she was going to join them but then something stopped them. “I should go,” Agnes says. “It was nice to meet you two, I’m sure we’ll see each other around.
    </p>
<p>
     “We will,” Rio assures. “Te Veo,” Rio says, as Agatha leaves trying to use a little hint of what they once were to put a crack in the spell that has enveloped Agatha, and Agatha doesn’t respond she just leaves, closing the door behind her. “Are you okay?” Rio asks Nicky, as soon as Agatha is gone.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Nicky admits. “I know she doesn’t remember us, but it was like she didn’t even remember meeting us a week ago,” Nicky comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because I don’t think she does Nicky,” Rio admits. “I’ve been watching, I think the spell resets every few days, makes her think she is a different version of reality every few days, and she doesn’t remember anything that happened in her last version of reality, ” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “If Mama’s reality keeps resetting, how are we going to break her out of it?” Nicky asks, as it seems to him like the spell is constantly adapting to make sure that cracks in it can’t form.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits. “But we’re going to figure it out, we’ll figure this all out,” Rio tells her son, who nods even though he doesn’t have quiet as much faith. “Looks like we’ve got some great ingredients in here, how about we get started on lunch,” Rio suggests as she knows what cooking means to Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky responds, and the two of them head to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Once in the kitchen Nicky and Rio start to cook together it being clear to Rio that Nicky is still struggling with being around Agatha when she doesn’t know who he is.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      December 2023
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     A few weeks have passed since Rio and Nicky moved into Westview and ever since it has become clear that Rio’s suspicion about the spell Agatha re-setting every few days is right, as is Nicky’s theory that the spell is trying to adapt to prevent it from being broken, and because of that neither of them have figured out how they can break Agatha out of the spell without causing more harm.
    </p>
<p>
     While his mother is off doing her job Nicky is in the living area of the house they are living in reading while sitting on the window seat, as he reads Nicky looks out of the window and notices Agatha, across the street, trying to carry too many shopping bags at once.
    </p>
<p>
     Not even thinking about what it will mean Nicky quickly gets up, puts his book down, and goes running as fast as he can outside, across the street, and to where Agatha has just dropped her grocery bags.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, let me help,” Nicky says to Agatha, getting to her and starting to help her pick up the groceries.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s sweet of you,” Agnes says to Nicky. “I’ve been so busy at school that I didn’t realise I hadn’t done shopping in a while until I had nothing left,” Agnes explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a teacher?” Nicky asks amazed. “That’s amazing,” Nicky says, smiling slightly, as he knows that what he wants most is to get lessons from his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Agnes says, as Nicky continues to pack up her groceries. “Sorry, what did you say your name is?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, Nicky Vidal-Harkness,” Nicky responds, without even thinking about it, but the second he says it he regrets it, as Agatha gets a look that he can only describe as pure devastation on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “No…. no…. I don’t know who you are… what game you’re playing… but you’re not him,” Agatha says, looking both furious and devastated, which for Nicky is everything, but after a few second it disappears, as Nicky ‘feel’s’ the spell once again tighten it’s hold on his mama. “I’m sorry, did you say something?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Nicky says, fighting back tears. “I’m going to help you,” Nicky says to his Mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “You already have,” Agnes tells Nicky. “You saved my groceries,” Agnes tells Nicky, before standing up.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to save you,” Nicky mutters, and he watches Agatha walk away, feeling his heart break as she goes, as once again, just for a split second, he felt like he was getting through to his Mama.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea what Nicky has gotten up to while she has been gone Rio is returning home a little while after Nicky talked to Agatha, not that she knows that. Just like she always done the first thing Rio does is go in search of her son.
    </p>
<p>
     Not finding him downstairs Rio heads upstairs and the second she gets to the upstairs landing Rio hears a sound, but she knows, but hates, the sound of Nicky crying. Hurrying into Nicky’s room Rio finds him lying on his side, his chests against his chest as he cries.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Rio asks concerned. “What happened, Mi Conejito?” Rio asks her son as she sits down on the edge of his bed. “Whatever happened, it will be okay,” Rio assures her son, even though she knows that is not necessarily the case.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it won’t,” Nicky says as he rolls over and faces his mom, who sees a look of complete devastation on Nicky’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” Rio asks, feeling confused about what could have caused such a reaction in Nicky, but suspecting it might have something to do with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw Mama outside, struggling with groceries, so I went to help her,” Nicky explains, and Rio can’t imagine Agatha struggling with something so mundane as groceries. “She thinks she’s a teacher at the moment,” Nicky explains, saying so with a fond smile. “She asked me what my name was,” Nicky says, and as he does Rio tenses, as she realises what must have happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” Rio asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “At first she got really upset, and angry, said no, that she didn’t know who I was, but I couldn’t be him, that she didn’t know what game I was playing,” Nicky says, it feels painful for him to explain that. “But it only lasted a second and it was gone, and she had no idea what just happened… I don’t know what was worse,” Nicky admis.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m really sorry, Nicky,” Rio says to her son. “But you need to know the reason Mama reacted like that is because deep down inside of Mama, in a place the witches spell can never destroy or truly hide, she knows how much she loves you, how much she misses you, and that’s what came out today,” Rio says. “You are Mama’s everything, nothing, not even someone as powerful as the Scalet Witch, can take that away,” Rio assures Nicky, hoping he believes her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It feels like she already has,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “She hasn’t, she would never,” Rio assures Nicky. “We’ll figure this out, we’ll get her back,” Rio promises Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to,” Nicky says, and Rio agrees with that, so in response, she pulls her son up into her arms and holds him close, both of them desperately hoping they can get through to Agatha soon.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A few weeks have passed since Agatha freaked out when she heard Nicky’s name and ever since both he and Rio have made an effort not to use Nicky’s name around Agatha, something which is seemingly working well.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s Christmas Eve and both Nicky and Rio are in their kitchen putting some of the incredible amount of food into different containers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think she will even accept it?” Nicky asks Rio, sounding worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have seen other people in the neighbourhood give her food and she’s accepted it, I think we’ll be okay,” Rio says, as she finishes putting the last of the food into containers, feeling glad that there are other people looking out for Agatha when it gets too much for her and Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, relieved. “Um, so there is the carols thing in the square tonight, do you think we could get Mama to come with us?” Nicky asks curious, as he knows he would love that, as since being in Westview he has realised that they take holidays very seriously, something which he has never experienced before, but very much enjoys.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can ask,” Rio says. “But Nicky…” Rio starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be disappointed if she says no, I know,” Nicky confirms, knowing she was going to say that because she knows his mom is trying to help him with what he is feeling about everything that has been going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, go get your coat,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aren’t you forgetting something?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not I know of,” Rio responds, looking around, wondering what Nicky could be talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your Christmas sweater!” Nicky says to his mother, like it should be obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not happening,” Rio tells her son as while she appreciates that he brought her a novelty Christmas sweater that doesn’t mean she is actually going to wear it.
    </p>
<p>
     “But mom…” Nicky starts to object.
    </p>
<p>
     “But nothing, I’m not wearing it,” Rio tells her son. “Coat, gloves,” Rio tells her son, wanting to make sure he is warm enough as she never wants to go through Nicky having pneumonia again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Nicky says, and he goes to collect what he needs.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A few minutes later Nicky is bundled up in a coat, gloves, beanie and scarf as he and Rio walk towards Agatha’s house, both of them carrying bags of food.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do we know what her current reality is?” Nicky asks, as he knows that will tell them a lot about what it’s going to be like to interact with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I haven’t seen her for a few days,” Rio admits, and Nicky nods in understanding. “We’ll find out as soon as we knock, I’d imagine,” Rio admits, as it tends to become clear pretty quickly what Agatha is seeing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds about right,” Nicky says, as they get to the door which he reaches out and knock on.
    </p>
<p>
     Seconds after Nicky nod the door opens to reveal Agatha and as soon as she sees her Rio has to bite her tongue as Agatha is dressed head to toe in Christmas attire, something which is so far from Agatha, and isn’t always how the spell works as sometimes her clothes seem regular to everyone else, but Agatha sees them as something different.
    </p>
<p>
     “Merry Christmas!” Agnes greats with an over the top grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Merry Christmas, Agnes,” Nicky says, smiling at her, as while he knows that she isn’t completely his mama at the moment he is glad to see her so happy as that’s often not a guarantee when it comes to what she is preserving as reality. “We made so much food that we thought we would bring you some,” Nicky says, as he hands Agatha the food.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that is incredible of you! I have been so focused on decorations that I completely forget about food!” Agnes reveals. “And then guess what happened, I ruined my wreath! and I have no time to go get a new one!” Agnes explains, and it is clear to both Rio and Nicky that in this version of reality that is something that really bothers her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well talk about serendipity,” Rio says, moving one of her hands behind her and using her green witch magic to conjure a perfect, lush, wreath, covered in purple flowers. “We just happen to have an extra wreath,” Rio says, as she presents the wreath to Agatha, who looks amazed, while it’s Nicky’s turn to attempt not to laugh at his mothers blatant magic use, and his how oblivious his Mama was to that use.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s beautiful, thank you,” Agnes says to Rio, taking it form her, with an amazed look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “My pleasure,” Rio responds, and after a few seconds she has to look away from Agatha because it hurts to see her looking an her with affection but no recognition.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, um, we were going to head to the town square for the carols and we were wondering if you’d like to join us,” Nicky says to Agnes, being able to tell that his mother is struggling a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I would love to!” Agnes exclaims. “Just let me take this food and beautiful wreath inside,” Agnes says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, we’ll be right here,” Rio responds, and Agatha takes the food and wreath and heads inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Nicky asks his mother curious, as he can tell that she is struggling. While Nicky is also struggling his mama was always kind and joyful to him, so he isn’t as uncomfortable with the current persona Agatha is under as his mom is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m okay,” Rio says, honestly not sure if she is, but before she can explain more Agatha, dressed in a Christmas coat, appears back in the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s get this show on the road!” Agnes says joyfully, and the three of them walk together towards the town square.
    </p>
<p>
     As they walk together, listening to Agnes happily talk about Christmas, both Rio and Nicky have complicated feeling as while they are both beyond happily that they are getting to spend time with Agatha there is a level of sadness because it’s not really her, and Rio can’t help but think about how this is everything she has wanted for the past five years and yet it is still wrong,
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, there’s carnival food! Can I go see what they have?” Nicky asks excitedly, when they finally get to the square.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, just don’t leave the square,” Rio tells her son, as while there hasn’t been anything to indicate there is still danger in Westview, she can’t be too careful.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Nicky responds, and he hurries away from his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “He seems like a great kid,” Agnes says to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s the best,” Rio says, knowing that without the doubt.
    </p>
<p>
     “And it’s just the two of you?” Agnes asks, clearly trying to dig for information and Rio knows she has to play this delicately otherwise she risks the spell once again tightening it’s hold on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “For now,” Rio says, choosing her words carefully. “But we’re going to get his other mother back,” Rio says, watching Agatha carefully to see if her words have any effect.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope you do,” Agnes says, her words being innocent, but they severely hurt Rio. “And incredible boy like that deserves to have his mom and mama,” Agatha says in a quiet voice, and just for a second Rio sees a flicker of Agatha, but just like every time Rio has seen a flicker of the real Agatha it’s gone just a quickly. “Sorry, was I saying something?” Agnes asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just that you were going to get a table while I got the three of us some hot chocolate,” Rio says, needing some space for a minute.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seems like a plan Doll,” Agnes responds, and the two of them go in their different directions.
    </p>
<p>
     A few minutes later Rio, who has gotten hot chocolate and also may have punched a tree, Nicky who has gotten food, and Agatha who has gotten a lyric books and other souvenirs, all get to the same table where they sit down together, and start to share what they have all brought.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though it’s not perfect, and both Rio and Nicky would prefer that Agatha knew who they are, they both find themselves enjoying every second that the three of them spend single carols and celebrating Christmas, as for the first time in over a hundred years it’s almost like they are a family again.

<strong>
      February 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Christmas and in that time both Nicky and Rio have been spending time with Agatha and have started to realise how much they can get away with without causing the spell to tighten its strangled hold on her, but despite understanding the spell a little better they are no closure to figuring out a way to break it.
    </p>
<p>
     Standing in their living room hand and hand Nicky and Rio are both speaking in the language that only the two of them speak as they perform a spell, Rio’s green magic and Nicky’s blue with purple and green hue, magic dancing around them, combining, expanding, working in harmony with each other to create their goal.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s done,” Rio says as the magic fades away, but both Nicky and Rio know that it is still unseen all around them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can feel it,” Nicky says. “We’ve used the magic interference in this town to create a pulse within this house to try to interfere with all other magic,” Nicky says, knowing that it feels like a subtle pounding, like a pulse to him.  “It’s not going to last long,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, and with the fact that the spell Agatha is under is created from the same magic there is no guarantee it will work, but we need to try,” Rio says, knowing that they are both willing to do whatever it takes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll go get Mama,” Nicky says, knowing that time is not on their hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “How are you going to get her here?” Rio asks, as she realises, they haven’t talked about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “This version of her thinks she is a plumber, I’ll say you need help,” Nicky says before hurrying out of the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’ll work,” Rio responds, as she watches Nicky go.
    </p>
<p>
     As he knows that every second counts Nicky runs, as fast as he can, across, and then down the street. Getting to Agatha’s door, a place he has become quite familiar with, Nicky quicky knocks, and after a few seconds the door opens to reveal Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agnes, good you’re here. We need your help we’re having a plumbing emergency,” Nicky says to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me get my tools,” Agnes says, and she picks up an empty shoebox which Nicky realises must be what she considers to be a toolbox. “Let’s go,” Agnes says to Nicky and the two of them hurry back towards Nicky and Rio’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     “The problem is through here,” Nicky says, leading Agatha into the living room and as soon as they walk into the house Nicky can feel the spell, he and Rio cast ‘fight’ with the spell Agatha is under for lack of a better word. “Something’s happening,” Nicky says, as Agatha freezes
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio says, taking a step forward, doing so hesitantly as she doesn’t know what expect, she doesn’t know if they are going to succeed at what they have tried to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “YOU!” Agatha says, looking furious, as she drops the shoebox she is holding.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you know who I am?” Rio asks, feeling hope for the first time in months.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I know who you are,” Agnes says angrily. “You’re my bitch of an ex-wife who left a trail of destruction and death in her wake!” Agnes exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not technically wrong,” Rio says, having a feeling that she is not completely ‘Agatha’ but that the fact that she is feeling so much anger for her gives Rio hope that they have an opening. “Agatha, look at me, see me, really see me,” Rio pleads.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha? Who’s Agatha? Is that your side piece?” Agnes asks, the words hurting Rio more than she wants to admit, but as Nicky knows his mom so well, he can tell that. “I’m out of here,” Agatha heads towards the door, Nicky feeling the spell Agatha is under drawing more power, more strength, from the caster, burying the real Agatha deep below the spider web of the magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama!” Nicky yells but considering the magic he is feeling he isn’t surprised when Agatha doesn’t turn around, doesn’t look at him, and instead leaves. “Damn it!” Nicky says annoyed as the door slams.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I thought that might have worked,” Rio admits, feeling worse for her son than for herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “It started to, but the spell just drew more strength from Wanda,” Nicky says, knowing that is going to keep drawing strength from her while Wanda is alive, but she likely hasn’t even realised that. “Maybe Magic is the key, what if I just used magic in front of mom, or sent a blast at Mama so she could feel my magic, that would break through,” Nicky suggests, thinking that the connection his and his mama’s magic share could be key, and as she hears Nicky’s words Rio’s face loses all colour, clearly horrified at the suggestion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, no,” Rio tells her son, her voice stern.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wouldn’t be a strong blast, I wouldn’t hurt Mama,” Nicky says in his defence, feeling that that should be obvious, and his mother shouldn’t be looking as horrified as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, listen to me, you cannot blast your mom, you can never do that, no matter what,” Rio tells her son. “Even if it meant protecting yourself you need to find another way,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the completely opposite to everything you’ve always told me,” Nicky says confused, as his mom has always made it clear that he is always to use magic to protect himself if needed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sit down,” Rio says to her son, realising that they have to have a conversation that they should have had long before now.
    </p>
<p>
     “What am I missing?” Nicky asks curious, as he sits down, and Rio sits down next to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I know we’ve talked a lot about Mama’s magic, and how she is powerful,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, one of her abilities is that if she is blasted with magic, she will start to siphon that magic from the person,” Rio explains. “She can’t control it, not really,” Rio says, knowing that because she has seen it, because she has seen what it does to Agatha when it happens. “So, whenever Mama is blasted with magic, she will keep siphoning the magic until there is nothing left,” Rio tells her son, who realises what her mother isn’t saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “And the person who she is siphoning from dies,” Nicky realises, not even being able to imagine what that would feel like for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio confirms. “Which is why, no matter what, you can never blast Mama with your magic,” Rio tells her son, her voice stern, as she knows what would happen to Nicky, and what that would do to Agatha. “Promise me, Nicky, promise me, that you will never blast your Mama,” Rio says to Nicky, needing him to understand how serious it is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise,” Nicky says, and Rio looks relieved at that. “Are you okay? Mama words were kind of cruel,” Nicky says to his mother, having no idea how she seems to be okay considering what Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve heard worse,” Rio respond, knowing that after Nicky died Agatha says things a lot worse to her.  “I’m okay, Nicky,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to be,” Nicky responds, moving closer to his mother and hugging her, being able to tell that she is hurt, even though she is trying to hide it.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      May 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three months have passed since Nicky and Rio once again tried to break the spell Agatha was after and while it is clear that they weren’t successful it is also clear that they changed something as in almost every reality Agatha ‘knows’ Rio as someone from her past who she hates and has some kind of romantic history with, but she never knows more than that.
    </p>
<p>
     While his mom is trying to hide how Agatha hating her is affecting her Nicky can tell that it is starting to take its toll, and he hates that there is nothing he can do to help her. While Rio is off doing her job Nicky is walking around the neighbourhood as he was feeling a little cooped up inside. As he makes his way down the street Nicky sees his mama leave her house and as he does, he gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve had worse ideas,” Nicky mutters, and before he can overthink what he is going to do too much Nicky hurries towards Agatha’s house, considering everything Nicky isn’t surprised that the door is unlocked, not that a look door would stop him.
    </p>
<p>
     Once in the house Nicky starts to look around the house, wanting to see if there is an consistency with his mama’s reality when it constantly changes. For a while Nicky looks around, not seeing anything that indicates his mama is experiencing any sense of constancy, but then he notices something on the bench.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking over to the bench Nicky sees that there is a piece of paper feeling curious he picks it up and to his surprise he finds that it is a drawing, a drawing of what is clearly him, before he died, with both his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really are still in there,” Nicky realises, picking up the picture and looking at it in amazement, not sure exactly how to feel about that because he has no idea how to help as he can feel how the spell strangles his mama every time he tries.
    </p>
<p>
     As he stares at the picture his mama drew, knowing how much he wants all three of them to be together all knowing the truth, Nicky hears the front door open and so to avoid awkward questions he quickly leaves through the backdoor, leaving the picture behind even though he would like to take it with him.
    </p>
<p>
     After leaving Agatha’s house Nicky continues his walk around the neighbourhood, not feeling completely ready to go ‘home’ yet as he doesn’t want his mom to realise how much it hurts him being so close to his mama when she doesn’t know who he is because he is pretty sure that the hate Rio is getting is worse.
    </p>
<p>
     So, instead of heading home Nicky just keeps walking, fighting back tears as he thinks about how much he wants his mama to remember who she is, who he is, so that they can be a family again.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three months have passed since Nicky saw tangible proof that somewhere deep down inside his Mama remembers who she is, but to his disappointment neither he nor his mom have been able to figure out a way to bring that part of her to the surface.
    </p>
<p>
     It is the day of Nicky’s fourteenth birthday and just like she has for the past six years Rio is walking into his bedroom first thing in the morning carrying a birthday cake she made.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy Birthday, Nicky,” Rio says, as she walks towards her son, who smiles and moves up in his bed so that he is properly sitting up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Mom,” Nicky says, and once Rio, and therefore the cake, are close enough Nicky blows out the candles, making the same wish he has made for the past six years, for him to be truly reunited with his mama. “The record holds,” Nicky says with a proud look on his face, as every year he has managed to blow out the candles in one go.
    </p>
<p>
     “It does,” Rio confirms, and over the next few minutes she cuts a couple of pieces of cake, one of which she gives to Nicky while she keeps the other to herself as she sits down next to him. “So, you haven’t given me a straight answer about what you want to do today,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Mom, I don’t think either of us can do anything straight,” Nicky jokes, not being able to resist the opening he has been waiting for, and Rio has to chuckle at the joke.
    </p>
<p>
     “You might have a point there,” Rio says, knowing that is the first time Nicky has confirmed what she’s suspected for a while, and it makes her so happy to know that he felt comfortable enough to just casually say it. “But you’re also avoiding the question,” Rio tells her son. “Talk,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to do anything,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Rio says, drawing out her son’s name because she knows there is something he isn’t saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “The only thing I want to do is break the spell on Mama and we proven that right now we can’t do that,” Nicky says annoyed. “There’s nothing else I want,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, that’s what I want too,” Rio tells her son. “But we’re not doing nothing for your birthday,” Rio tells her son. “So, we’re going to finish the cake, and then you’re going to get ready and by the time you’re in the kitchen you’re going to have some ideas of what we’re going to do,” Rio tells her son, knowing she has her own idea, but she isn’t going to share that with Nicky as she isn’t sure she is going to be able to pull it off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mom,” Nicky responds, and the two of them continue to eat their cake together, as they do Rio puts her arm around her son and kisses his head, as Nicky snuggles into his mother’s side, feeling how much love and support his mother gives him.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after she brought the cake into Nicky’s bedroom Rio is walking downstairs but rather than heading to the kitchen where she will be meeting her soon when he is ready Rio heads out of the front door and makes the familiar root to Agatha’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting to the door Rio pauses for a second, knowing to expect anger as in the reality that started the day before Anges, the nurse, sees Rio as the doctor who broke her heart because Rio thought their relationship was a threat to their carer.
    </p>
<p>
     “For Nicky,” Rio reminds herself as while it is getting harder to be around Agatha’s hate she knows she will deal with it for her son, and so she reaches out and knocks.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell are you doing here?” Agnes asks angrily, as soon as she sees Rio standing on her doorstep.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not here for me,” Rio explains. “Today is my son’s fourteenth birthday,” Rio says, it taking everything in her not to say ‘our’ son, but she knows that won’t get her anywhere if she tries. “And he’d really like to spend time with you,” Rio says, not needing Nicky to say that to know it. “Will you come over?” Rio asks, desperately hoping that Agatha says yes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can do that…. for him,” Agnes says, and Rio can’t help but wonder what Agatha considers her relationship with Nicky to be in this version of her reality, but whatever Agatha is experiencing Rio knows that Agatha wouldn’t be seeing him as a son as Wanda’s spell is designed to punish Agatha and allowing her to have maternal feelings towards anyone when she blames Agatha for losing her own children isn’t something she would allow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says sincerely.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to clean up, but I can be over in about ten minutes,” Agnes tells Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d say you look perfect to me, but okay,” Rio says, and Agatha smiles at that. “Te Veo,” Rio says before walking away, feeling relieved that that worked, as she isn’t entirely sure what she would have done if it hadn’t.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Not quite ten minutes later Rio is in the kitchen of her house trying to get breakfast ready, when Nicky walks into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom,” Nicky says, and Rio looks up on him. “I know she’s not really Mama right now, and if it will just hurt you I understand and we don’t have to, but I would really like it if we could spend some time with Agnes today,” Nicky explains, needing to separate Agnes and his Mama in his mind as it’s the only way he can handle his reality, and before Rio can answer there is a knock on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should get that,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling confused Nicky heads to the door and when he opens it, he is surprised, but absolutely thrilled, to find Agatha standing on the other side.
    </p>
<p>
     “M…Agnes?” Nicky asks amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I heard it was your birthday,” Agnes says with a grin, as she hands Nicky a phonebook which Nicky assumes she is seeing as some kind of present. “Happy Birthday, Kiddo,” Agnes says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Nicky says, fighting back emotions at that, as even if she isn’t really his mama at the moment it means everything to him to finally hear her wish him happy birthday and it takes all his strength not to throw himself into his Mama’s arms and hug her like he desperately wants to. “Thank you,” Nicky tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome, but it’s your birthday, you get presents,” Agnes tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I think I just got an incredible one,” Nicky admits. “Mom’s in the kitchen, we’ve already had cake but we’re about to have breakfast,” Nicky tells Agnes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve had cake before breakfast?” Agnes asks as they wake their way to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s tradition,” Nicky says with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not the most healthy one,” Agnes comments as they walk into the kitchen, a level of disapproval in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you don’t think eating cake for breakfast is healthy, you’re really not going to like what else we’re having,” Rio comments, trying to hide her amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess we’ll have to see,” Anges comments. “Are you cooking?” Agatha asks and the surprise in her voice makes Rio feel amazed, just for a second, as she knows that that is a hint of Agatha remembering something on a subconscious level, but because the day is about Nicky and not her, she doesn’t dwell on it. “We all are,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s gonna be great,” Nicky comments, and to his absolute joy he and both his moms make breakfast together. For Nicky it is almost perfect as he knows the only thing that would make it better is if Agatha remembered everything, and when neither Agatha nor Nicky are looking, Rio manages to take a picture of the two of them cooking together using the cell phone she recently got.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      September 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Not even a month has passed since Nicky’s fourteenth birthday and while Nicky, Rio and Agatha managed to have an incredible day together, and both Rio and Nicky have a copy of the photo Rio took, it has become clear that they would both give anything if it meant Agatha truly remembered who they were.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s a pretty average summers day and Rio is walking into the living room where Nicky is surrounded by books as there is something she needs to talk to him about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Rio says, as she walks over to him, being careful not to step on any of his books. “There’s something I want to talk to you about,” Rio says, as she sits down next to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not giving up on Mama, are you?” Nicky asks terrified, as he can tell that his mother is using the serious tone, the very tone she doesn’t use often.
    </p>
<p>
     “Never,” Rio assures her son. “That’s never going to be something I’m ever going to even consider doing,” Rio promises he son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, relieved about that. “So, what’s with the serious tone?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re stating high school next week,” Rio tells her son, feeling that it would be best to just say it, rather than beating around the bush.
    </p>
<p>
     “What!” Nicky exclaims shocked. “I’ve never had to go to school before,” Nicky says to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because until Westview we’ve never stayed at a place too long,” Rio reminds her son. “But the truth is we are creating a life here, and we’re going to be here until we break the spell on Mama, which means you should go to school,” Rio tells her son. “Be around other kids,”
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I don’t want to be around other kids?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky…” Rio starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “NO!” Nicky says frustrated as he stands up. “Since when do you just unilaterally decide things without us talking about it?” Nicky asks annoyed. “I have nothing in common with other kids! I’m literally over a hundred years older than them,” Nicky reminds his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s exactly why you should go to school,” Rio tells him. “You’ve never had anything normal; this could be that normalcy you’ve missed out on,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you the one who says normalcy is overrated?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio confirms. “But I want you to be able to make friends, to not be so alone,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have you,” Nicky reminds him mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you need more than me,” Rio tells her son, knowing that he needs Agatha, and also feeling that he deserves to have friend around his age, at least his physical age.
    </p>
<p>
     “I never have before,” Nicky tells his mom, not understanding what changed. “You, mama, you’re all I need,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky…” Rio stats to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “No! I’m not going! I need to spend my time helping Mama not stuck in a classroom,” Nicky says, and he runs out of the room, as Rio hurries to her feet to follow she is thrown backwards by a blast of magic as Nicky runs out of the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “NICKY!” Rio yells in terror as she tries, and fails, to get to her feet.

      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. Hope you like this chapter. I am extremely nervous for 1x07, so the next chapter will be out after that, partly because I am not doing night shift tonight. Please let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For about five minutes Rio has to fight against her son’s magic before being able to get up, and honestly if she wasn’t so worried about him, she would be impressed. Once on her feet Rio doesn’t even worry about shoes before she goes running out of the house.
    </p>
<p>
     Focusing only on her son and nothing else Rio looks around the street as she runs, looking for signs of him, and as she is so distracted she doesn’t even notice Agatha walking down the street until she barrels into her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” Rio says, completely distracted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should…. What’s wrong?” Agnes asks, there being something about the look on Rio’s face that makes all the anger she is feeling disappears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nic… my son and I got in a fight, and he ran,” Rio explains, as she gets to his feet, correcting herself before she say Nicky’s name because she doesn’t want to to cause the reaction Agatha has whenever she hears Nicky’s name. “I don’t know where he’s gone,” Rio says, her voice breaking, feeling terrified as not only have she and Nicky never had a fight like the one they just had he has also never run away like he just did.
    </p>
<p>
     “It will be okay,” Agatha says, getting a feeling deep inside which tells her she has to do whatever she can to help Rio. “We’ll find him,” Agatha tells Rio, using a gentle voice Rio hasn’t heard form Agatha in the entire time they have been in Westview.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to,” Rio says, tears coming to her eyes. “I can’t lose him too, not again,” Rio admits, feeling terrified of what one of their many enemies would do if they were to find Nicky alone, away from her protection.
    </p>
<p>
     “You won’t,” Agatha says as she reaches out and wipes Rio’s tears, and as she does Rio allows herself a few moments to lean into the touch. “Where do you think he would have gone?” Agatha asks, and for Rio she seems so much closer to being the Agatha Rio’s known for centuries again.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘Um, maybe the library,” Rio suggests, purposely moving away from Agatha’s hand so she doesn’t lose focus. “He loves it there,” Rio admits, though she knows that that isn’t saying much as there aren’t a whole lot of places in Westview Nicky has spent time in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then let’s start there,” Agatha says, taking Rio’s hand. “Come on,” Agatha says, and the two of them go running towards the library.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next few minutes Rio and Agatha run, still holding each other’s hands, towards the town centre where the library is.
    </p>
<p>
     “There,” Agatha says, pointing to the gazebo where she sees Nicky sitting.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s okay,” Rio says amazed, feeling unbelievably relieved.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, he is,” Agatha assures her, as she gently squeezes Rio’s hand, offering her silent support.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s not going to want to talk to me,” Rio realises, knowing that, having no idea how she is going to handle this.
    </p>
<p>
     “All you can do is try,” Agatha tells Rio, and for the first time since Nicky died it feels like they are a team. “I can stay close, just in case you need backup,” Agatha offers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Rio says, and she reluctantly let’s go of Agatha’s hand and walks over to where Nicky is sitting, while Agatha stays nearby to watch them, or at least she does until the spell causes her to forget why she is there.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I hurt you?” Nicky asks concerned as Rio sits down next to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t hurt me, Nicky, we’ve been over this,” Rio tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know... I’m still sorry that I used my magic against you,” Nicky admits, as once he calmed down, he realised that wasn’t okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, you were upset, you lashed out, that’s okay,” Rio tells her son. “But now that you’ve lashed out, we need to talk about it,” Rio tells him, knowing that both she and Agatha find the lashing out easier than the talking about it, so now she is worried that for Nicky it will be the same. “Why are you so against going to school?” Rio ask her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love learning, you know that, when you quoted Mama saying knowledge is power you were both right,” Nicky assures his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “But?” Rio asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “But what do I need to know that school can teach me?” Nicky asks, as he is pretty sure he already knows everything that school could teach him.
    </p>
<p>
     “A lot of different stuff,” Rio says, knowing it’s a weak answer. “But the education I want you to get isn’t just what you’ll learn in the classroom,” Rio says to her son. “I want you to learn how to socialize with people, to be apart of something, to spend time places other than our house, mama’s house, and the library,” Rio tells her son. “I don’t need to be around people or be truly apart of the world, but you do, and I want you to be,” Rio tells her son, as she doesn’t want him to be lonely, she doesn’t want him to be shut off from everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get that, Mom, I do,” Nicky admits. “But I just can’t help but think that every moment I spent at school will be time I’m not spending trying to help Mama,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you want to help Mama, I want to too, but trying to figure it out cannot be all you do. I don’t want that for you, and Mama wouldn’t either,” Rio says, knowing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It just feels so wrong not to,” Nicky admits. “I can feel the spell, Mom. Whenever I’m close to Mama, I can feel what it’s doing to her, can feel how it’s strangling and suffocating the real parts of her, and I hate how violating it feels,” Nicky admits, not sure if that is the best description, but knowing that that is what it feels like, violating. “I can’t just do nothing when I can feel what’s happening to her,” Nicky says sadly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I’m not asking you to, I never would,” Rio admits, trying to keep the horror she is feeling as Nicky describes what the spell Agatha is under feels like, out of her voice. “Let’s make a deal,” Rio says, and Nicky gives her an interested look. “You give high school a try until Christmas, a real try, that means you try to make friends, and you try to be apart of the world, and while you’re at school, I’ll continue your research,” Rio tells her son, knowing that Nicky is obsessively searching for an answer, a way to help Agatha. “We work on helping Mama together, so it doesn’t consume you,” Rio tells her son. “And at Christmas we’ll make a decision about revaluation,”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess that sounds fair… you’ve got a deal,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio responds, and once she does Nicky laughs. “What?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “There are like a million warnings against making deals with death,” Nicky says amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “With good reasons, but don’t worry you have nothing to worry about,” Rio assures her son, putting her arm around her son, and the two of them drift into silence as they sit together, Rio searching for Agatha as they and she finds herself feeling disappointed when she doesn’t see her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A week has passed since Nicky and Rio made their deal and practically every day since Nicky has wondered if he has made the right decision, and as he gets ready Nicky is feeling that doubt even more.
    </p>
<p>
     “NICKY! BREAKFAST!” Rio yells from downstairs, knowing that she doesn’t want Nicky to make things harder on himself by being late on his first day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coming,” Nicky calls back, and after picking up his bag he heads downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     About a minute later Nicky walks into the kitchen and the second he does Rio uses her phone to take a lot of photos of him, something which Nicky has realised she has been doing a lot.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously? More photos?” Nicky asks his mother, looking annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course more photos, it’s a big day,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, I love you, but this photo taking habit of yours is getting really out of control,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is nothing wrong with wanting to preserve moments,” Rio tells her son, and because he knows his mother he knows there is something she isn’t saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you… Mama,” Nicky realises. “You’re taking photos to show Mama when we break the spell,” Nicky realises, feeling like such an idiot for not realising that sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s missing out on so much, and I know she’s never going to get it back. So, I thought if I could take photos and videos, I’d at least have something to show her when we get her back,” Rio explains to her son, needing to focus on what they will do for Agatha after they lift the spell rather than her fear that they won’t manage to break it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, that’s actually a really good reason,” Nicky realises, then sighs. “Okay, you can as many photos and videos you want to show mama,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Glad you agree,” Rio responds, as while she was going to keep taking photos anyway it is nice to have Nicky’s okay. “How are you feeling about school?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nervous,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have no reason to be, you’ll be fine Mi Conejito,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hope so,” Nicky says nervously, and his mother hugs him. After a few moments the two of them break apart and have breakfast together before Nicky heads off to school where, to his surprise, he actually enjoys his first day.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      November 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky started school and to his surprise, he actually enjoys himself, though every time he goes to school he feels incredibly guilty, despite what Rio has told him multiple times, that he is enjoying himself when he feels like he should be helping his Mama.
    </p>
<p>
     For an entirety Rio has been ferrying people to where they need to go, there have been times where she found the job difficult, and one time in particular where she found it incredibly painful, so painful that she didn’t want to do it, but as she returns home from her latest time taking someone to the veil she knows she has never felt the amount of overwhelming feelings she is currently feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Anger, pain, devastation, heartbreak, guilt, fury are all emotions that Rio feels as she returns to her son after taking Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch herself, to the veil that separates life from death. Having teleported straight into the house, as she couldn’t bring herself to walk past Agatha’s house, Rio spends a few minutes collecting herself before heading up to Nicky’s room.
    </p>
<p>
     As she approaches her sons room Rio needs to take several deep, calming, breaths, even though she technically doesn’t have to breathe. Getting to Nicky’s room Rio isn’t at all surprised to find Nicky sitting at his desk, digging through ancient spell books in an attempt to find a way to lift the spell on Agatha, something Rio knows might be impossible after what just happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Rio says to her son, and he looks up at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I know, I should be in bed,” Nicky says, as he sees her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Rio says to her son, as she walks towards him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom? What’s wrong?” Nicky asks, knowing from his mothers’ tone of voice that something is very wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s no easy way to say this, so I’m just going to say it, Wanda Maximoff is dead,” Rio tells her son. “I took her to the veil, she crossed over, but something felt different,” Rio admits, considering what she is Rio wouldn’t be surprised if Wanda came back, but that’s not her current problem. “She wouldn’t tell me how to break the spell,” Rio admits, honestly not sure if Wanda knew, but also knowing that as soon as Wanda realised that she cares about Agatha there was no way she was going to help. “I honestly don’t know how her death has effected the spell,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s find out,” Nicky says as he quickly gets to his feet and hurries out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky wait,” Rio says as she gets up and chases after her son, getting to him as they both get to the front door. “Nicky, we don’t know effect Wanda’s death will have on the spell,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but whatever effect it has I’ll be able to feel, I’ll know,” Nicky responds. “We need to know Mom,” Nicky tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we do,” Rio confirms. “How close do you need to get?” Rio asks, as they have never actually talked about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ideally same room,” Nicky responds, knowing that will allow him to truly ‘feel’ the spell and the effects it is having on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, let’s go,” Rio says and the two of them head towards Agatha’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     A couple of minutes later Rio and Nicky get to Agatha’s house, and seeing no sign that she is awake, Rio uses her magic to open the locked door allowing both mother and son to enter.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll search down here first,” Rio tells her son in a quiet voice, Nicky nods, and they both head into the living room where they find Agatha unconscious.
    </p>
<p>
     Hurrying forward Rio checks and is relieved when she realises that Agatha is just asleep. “She’s asleep,” Rio says, turning around to look at her son, and as she sees the look on his face Rio feels dread rise up inside of her. “Nicky?” Rio asks, and Nicky stumbles back, but before he can fall Rio hurries over to stabilize him. “I’ve got you,” Rio assures her son as she helps lower him to his knees. “What do you feel?” Rio asks, knowing that that is what they need to talk to, as she squats down on the ground next to him, feeling terrified about what he is going to say next.
    </p>
<p>
     “The spell, it’s so much stronger,” Nicky admits, feeling the ‘weight’ of it. “It can’t draw strength from Wanda anymore so the last of her strength, before she died, went into keeping the spell intact,” Nicky admits, taking a couple of deep breaths, do to what he is feeling. “I can feel Mama bubbling deep below, but when I tried to reach that with my magic that part of her got buried deeper,” Nicky revels, and as he does Rio has a horrible feeling what he means by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you saying you don’t think the spell can be broken?” Rio asks, needing to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m saying it can be. but not by challenging her reality outright like we’ve been trying, but by using her reality itself to loosen the hold the spell has on her,” Nicky admits. “We need to start by figuring out a crack, turn that crack into something bigger,” Nicky realises. “Give the part of Mama buried below a place to escape too, allow the hold to lessen a little,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do we do that?” Rio asks, realising from what her son is saying that confronting Agatha with the truth isn’t going to work.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Nicky admits. “But I know where to start my research now,” Nicky admits. “We’re gong to figure this out, Mom, I really think we are,” Nicky admits, having faith, and in response Rio just hugs her son, feeling comforted by his faith, but also feeling terrified that they aren’t going to figure it out.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      December 2024
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Just over a month has passed since Wanda died and ever since Nicky has been obsessively searching for a way to break the spell that is now even stronger. While Rio has been doing her best to help, she is also trying to hide from her son how terrified she is that they aren’t going to succeed.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s New Years Eve and even though he was out with some people he goes to school with Nicky is returning home before midnight. As soon as he walks into the house Nicky gets a feeling that something is ‘off’.
    </p>
<p>
     For a second Nicky debates what to do, before deciding that he needs to know what is going on, and so with his left hand he makes magic dance around his fingers, while he pulled the knife his mother gave him with his right. Walking deeper into the house Nicky is just confused about what he feels until he hears sniffling. Not even thinking about possible danger Nicky walks towards the sound and after a few seconds he sees something which makes his heart break, his Mom, sitting on the floor, sobbing while surrounded by no less than eight empty scotch bottles.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a word Nicky gets rid of his magic, and puts his knife back in it’s safe place before walking over to his mother and sitting next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve got you mom,” Nicky says, as he puts his arms around his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I miss her so much,” Rio says, as she completely breaks down in her sons’ arms, something she has never done before. “I just want her back,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky says, having no idea what else to do and so he just holds his mother, the cosmic entity, as she falls apart, Nicky knowing that he needs to do whatever he can to break the incredibly strong and intrinsic spell on is mama, that he owes that to both his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     For a while Nicky just holds Rio while she cries, until something truly concerning happens, and she passes out. Knowing that he cannot leave her on the ground Nicky uses his magic to levitate her and take her to her bed. Once Rio is in bed Nicky grabs his books and starts to research, knowing he is not going to give up until he has his answers, and when Rio wakes up in a few hours she doesn’t remember what happened, something which Nicky is sure is a good thing, and which isn’t something he is going to enlighten her about.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      January 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     A couple of weeks has passed since Rio completely broke down, something which she has no memory of doing, and ever since Nicky has been doing everything he can to try and help his moms. While he has been able to do ‘little’ things to help them Nicky knows that the only thing that will actually help them is breaking the spell, and Nicky hates that so far, his research hasn’t helped him figure out a way to do that.
    </p>
<p>
     It is Sunday afternoon and both Nicky and Rio are in the kitchen of their house making food together, food that is not for either of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re sure we haven’t made anything Mama doesn’t like?” Nicky asks, as he looks between the various things they have made, knowing that Rio will know that better than him.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve only made her favourites…. Whether Agnes likes them is another matter altogether,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Several things seem to be the same no matter the reality, hopefully taste in food is one of the things that stays the same,” Nicky comments, knowing one of those things is the reaction Agatha has to the name Nicky and because of that his name is never said around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hopefully,” Rio responds. “You know, we talked about this once, what we would do for a milestone birthday such as this one,” Rio tells her son, knowing that it is Agatha’s three hundredth and fiftieth birthday.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah? What did you decide to do?” Nicky asks his mother, who gets caught up in a very fond memory. “Mom?” Nicky asks, after a few seconds, noticing the fond look on his mother’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “You probably don’t want to know,” Rio admit, as what she is thinking is certainly not PG.
    </p>
<p>
     “Gross,” Nicky says, pulling a face, but then he turns serious. “Do you really think we’re going to be able to do this?” Nicky asks his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think as long as we don’t remind Mama of what is actually real, who she is, we should be able to,” Rio admits. “I think we both understand enough about how Mama perceives reality to be able to manipulate it,” Rio tells her son, knowing that they have both been ‘studying’ the ways Agatha perceives reality.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wish we didn’t have to manipulate her,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio tells her son. “But unless we break the spell it’s the only thing we can do,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Until,” Nicky corrects.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Until we break the spell, not unless, until,” Nicky corrects. “We are going to break the spell, Mom,” Nicky says, feeling worried because it almost seems like his mom is losing faith.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio says, though she knows she is having a hard time believing that lately. “Are you ready to go?” Rio asks, not wanting to talk about that anymore at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky says, as they both start to pick up the stuff they have made. “Are you sure you’re going to be, okay? I know Mama’s words hurt you even if you try to hide it,” Nicky says to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “They do, but it hurts more not being around her,” Rio admits, and the two of them head out of the house together, Nicky feeling worried about both his mothers as they go.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A couple of minutes later Rio and Nicky have made their way to Agatha’s house and are knocking on their door, after a few seconds the door opens to reveal Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Agatha asks, looking at Rio with an annoyed look on her face, which to Rio is easier to handle than the looks of hatred she often gets from Agatha these days.
    </p>
<p>
     “You invited us over yesterday for your birthday,” Rio says, knowing that it is risky to mention Agatha’s birthday but feel that as long as they don’t mention how old she is they should be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did?” Agatha asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did.” Nicky confirms. “So, we brought food…. If you’re still interested, I know you’ve been really caught up with the article you’re researching,” Nicky says to Agatha, trying to tie their lie into her current version of reality to get her to agree.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess I could eat,” Agatha admits. “And some company wouldn’t be too bad, even if it is yours,” Agatha says to Rio, looking less than happy to see her even if she is happy to see Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take that to mean you’re inviting us in,” Rio says, and she walks into the house with Nicky right behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next couple of hours Rio, Nicky and Agatha get to actually spend time together. From Agatha’s point of view, she is mending fences with someone who hurt her in the past while from Rio and Nicky’s they are actually getting to celebrate Agatha’s three hundred and fiftieth birthday together. As Nicky looks between his mothers, both of whom are drinking glasses of wine, he knows that as nice as it is, it’s not the way it should be, and he knows, without a doubt, that he needs to figure out a way to break the spell Agatha is under sooner rather than later.

     Thank you so much for the support. So, I loved 1x07. If you curious this is marked AU for a reason, even if things at certain times seem very close to cannon. I am still figuring out how everything will fit in the story. Next chapter will be up in about 12 hours.

<strong>
      March 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Agatha’s three hundred and fiftieth birthday and in that time, it has become clear that the hostility Agatha shows Rio every time her version of reality resets is really starting to get to her.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio has been gone longer than she typically is doing her job Nicky is distracting himself from the worry he is feeling about her by doing a whole lot of cooking. Having just finished cooking some chicken Nicky goes to put it on the bench when he notices just how much he cooked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I may have gone a bit overboard,” Nicky realises, as he looks between all the food he has made, knowing that if his mother were to arrive home, she would realise that he was worried as Rio knows the various ways, he distracts himself when he is concerned. “Mama could probably use some food,” Nicky realises, and he proceeds to pack up a lot of the food he has made so that he can give to Agatha, realising that that achieves two things, one is making sure his mama is looked after and two not causing his mom to worry when she realises how concerned he has been.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About ten minutes after he realised just how much food he has made Nicky is carrying a very large bag that is full of a lot of containers of a lot of the food he’s made and is walking up to Agatha’s door, knocking on it once he is close enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes?” Agatha asks, opening the door, and Nicky knows that in her current version of reality she is works from home as tech support, which explains the headband she is wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Agnes, I was doing some cooking, and I made some extra food, I thought you would like some,” Nicky explains, offering her the bag.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s lovely! Thank you!” Agnes says, taking the bag form Nicky. “Would you like to come in?” Agnes asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d love to,” Nicky responds, and he follows his mother into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “This smells amazing, you cooked all this?” Agnes asks as they head towards the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I love cooking,” Nicky responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Has it been a hobby of yours for long?” Agnes asks curious as they get to the kitchen, and Agnes gestures to the kitchen bench for Nicky to sit down.
    </p>
<p>
     “A while, cooking has always just been something I enjoy,” Nicky says, knowing that he enjoys cooking with his mom, but he has to be careful about mentioning that as he could cause Agatha distressed and that’s the last thing he want to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s good to have things you enjoy,” Agnes says, as she starts to put the food Nicky brough her away. “I enjoy fixing problems, and researching,” Agatha tells Nicky, and even though he knows she isn’t his ‘real’ mama right now it means a lot to Nicky to hear about a passion they share.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love researching too,” Nicky admits. “When I have a problem, I want to do everything I can to figure it out, no matter what, or how long, it takes” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha responds, and the two of them exchange smiles as Agatha finishes putting everything away and also sits down. “So, research, cooking, what else do you like to do?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s about it, other than learning languages,” Nicky says, knowing he can’t mention magic. “But I have just started to do guitar lessons at school,” Nicky reveals, as he started those lessons after Christmas.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re not enjoying them?” Agatha asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Nicky admits. “I’m not finding it as easy as I find academic things, which is frustrating,” Nicky admits. “I’m not sure I should continue,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “The fact that you’re struggling is exactly why you should continue,” Agnes tells Nicky. “You can’t grow without both knowledge and challenges,” Agatha tells him and from everything his mom has told him over his life Nicky thinks, just for a second that is a flicker of Agatha rather than Agnes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh, I’ve never thought about it like that,” Nicky admits. “Thanks M…Agnes,” Nicky says, silently cursing himself for his almost slipup. “How’s your work going?” Nicky asks, quickly tuning the topic of conversation to her reality so that he doesn’t cause her harm by causing conflicts with the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “Frustrating,” Agnes says. “People are very stupid,” Agnes responds, and Nicky laughs at that.
    </p>
<p>
     To Nicky’s joy he gets to spend the next hour just talking with his Mama, and when he gets home his mom is home again.
    </p>
<p>
     The following day Nicky, on his way to school, tries to talk to Agatha about what they talked about the day before, but it quickly becomes clear that her reality has reset, and she has no idea what he is talking about. While it causes him pain deep inside his heart Nicky keeps that to himself as he doesn’t want to cause his mom more pain than he already knows she is in.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      June 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three months have passed since Nicky got to spend an hour talking to his mama and because he has taken her advice Nicky has continued his guitar lessons despite how difficult he is finding it.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s Monday afternoon and Nicky is returning to the house after spending time at the Westview pool with people he goes to school with and as he walks into the house, he finds his mother sitting at the window seat staring outside, clearly oblivious to everything other than what she is looking at.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks concerned as he walks over to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, did you have a good time with your friends?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it was fun, I won our highest jump competition,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you use your magic?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not intentionally,” Nicky admits, not even considering not answering honestly. “But in my defence, someone who gives everyone a hard time was winning beforehand,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then sounds like you did what you needed to do,” Rio tells her son, before turning back to the window.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom? Are you okay?” Nicky asks, glancing out the window to see what she is looking at and considering everything he isn’t overly surprised to realise it is Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Today’s our anniversary,” Rio reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is?” Nicky asks surprised, feeling like an idiot for not realising that sooner. “How long?” Nicky asks, trying to do the math in his head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Two hundred and seventy-one years,” Rio answers, without needing to think about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” Nicky admits. “Why don’t you go talk to Mama? Spend time with her,” Nicky suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio says, shaking her head. “I can’t deal with her anger, her not knowing who I am, not today,” Rio admits, as Agatha’s reactions to her is really starting to take its toll on her, even if she tries to deny that fact, even if she tries everything to hide that from Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “When we break this spell, I’m going to make sure you and Mama have an incredible anniversary celebration, I’ll make sure you go all out,” Nicky tells his mother, having no other ideas of how to help her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Mi Conjito,” Rio tells her son, knowing that right now she is struggling to think about what it will be like when the spell is broken, and the two of them drift into silence as they sit together.
    </p>

     After staying with his mom for awhile Nicky has finally headed upstairs while she headed off to do her job. Considering how she is doing Nicky wanted to object to her go, but as he realised that it could be a distraction for her he held his tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking into his room Nicky heads straight over to his desk, and turns on his laptop, and opens the webcam.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, hi, Mama, today’s June 9th, 2025, you and Mom have been married for two hundred and seventy-one years, and we’ve all been in Westview for almost two years,” Nicky says, having no idea where he is going with what he is saying, but wanting to say it. “Right now, you’re still trapped, buried beneath the Scarlett Witches’ spell, but if you are watching this it means that I finally figured out how to break it, and if that’s the case I really hope I figure it out soon; Mama I’m really sorry it’s taken so long, I’m really sorry I’ve let you down,” Nicky admits, fighting back his guilt for a moment. “I know Mom is trying to remember everything about me so that she can tell you stories when we break the spell, well there are a few things I want to tell you about Mom,” Nicky admits. “The first is, she loves you, so much, and she’s taken really amazing care of me, she’s trying to be strong, and do everything alone, but I know how much she needs you,” Nicky admits. “There’s so much I could tell you about the last seven years, so many stories, I’m not sure where to start,” Nicky admits, then he gets an idea. “Oh, I know! I got mom to dress up as the Grim Reaper for a Halloween party! She did it once and said never again… she doesn’t know I got photos that I can’t wait to show you,” Nicky says, and he proceeds to spend the next little while telling stories about his mom, telling stories, filming a video he truly believes that one day soon his mama will be able to watch.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      August 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months has passed since Nicky recorded a very long video for his Mama and since then he has recorded a few more shorter videos for her as he has realised that he enjoys doing so.
    </p>
<p>
     It is Nicky’s fifteenth birthday and because he knows the tradition well, he is already awake when Rio walks into his room carrying his birthday cake.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s no fair, you’re meant to let me wake you up,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry Mom, I was too excited,” Nicky tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll forgive you, this time,” Rio tells her son. “You know the drill,” Rio says and as he blows out the candles Nicky makes the same wish he has made for the last seven years, having some hope that things are going to “And the record once again holds,” Rio says, in an over the top ‘announcer’ voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will make sure it always holds, trust me,” Nicky assures his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I do,” Rio assures her son as she cuts the cake for both of them, and sits down next to him. “So, any ideas about what you want to do today?” Rio asks Nicky curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “One… just not sure what you’ll think about it,” Nicky admits, sounding nervous as what he wants to do is not technically legal, not that he expects that to bother his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you’ll only know if you say it,” Rio tells her son. “What are you thinking?” Rio asks her son curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know I can’t legally gat my permit until I’m sixteen, but I was wondering if you’d start to teach me to drive,” Nicky suggests, as even though he can travel by magic means, and is still excitedly looking forward to the day where he can fly a broom with his Mama for the first time, he also wants to learn to drive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course I can,” Rio tells her son. “I barely use the car might as well teach you to use it,” Rio tells her son, seeing absolutely no problem with teaching her fifteen-year-old son to drive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Awesome,” Nicky says with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Once you know how to drive if you need to drive around town that’s fine, but not beyond without me knowing, and don’t draw attention to yourself,” Rio tells her son seeing no point in making him wait until he is sixteen to actually drive once he knows, but wanting to put a couple of conditions to make sure he is safe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Another deal with death,” Rio says. “Those deals are starting to stack up Mi Conejito,” Rio tells her son, who just laughs.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Many hours after Nicky suggested spending his birthday learning to drive that is exactly what he has done, spent the entire day with Rio in the car driving. While he struggled at first, and knows he still has a long way to go Nicky definitely felt like he did well in the time he has had.
    </p>
<p>
     By pure chance Nicky and Rio are pulling back into the driveway of their house, with take out, just as Agatha is walking near their house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom…” Nicky starts to say, and Rio doesn’t even need her to finish the question to know what he wants.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can ask if she wants to stay for dinner,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Mom,” Nicky says, and he quickly hurries out of the car. “Agnes,” Nicky calls as he runs towards her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, hello, how can I help you?” Agnes asks, as Nicky gets to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was actually helping you could help me,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, and how can I do that Kitten?” Agnes asks, as Rio knows that is the most ‘unlike Agatha’ nicknames she has heard Agnes use.
    </p>
<p>
     “Today is my birthday, and my mom and I got way too much takeout,” Nicky reveals, that actually being the truth as they couldn’t decide what they wanted so they got everything they wanted to try. “Any chance you’re interested in joining us to eat it all? I know I’d like it,” Nicky says and as he does, he notices Agatha glance at Rio who is standing several steps away.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like it to,” Rio says knowing what the look on Agatha’s face means even if the real Agatha is deeply buried beneath Agnes.
    </p>
<p>
     “We how can I say no to an invitation like that, I’d love to,” Agnes assures them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great, come on!” Nicky says excitedly as he hurries into the house, with his mothers following behind.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About forty-five minutes later Nicky, Rio, and Agatha have had an incredible dinner together, and unlike some of the other times they have spent together there is no tension between Agatha and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got a pretty incredible kid in there,” Agnes says to Rio as the two of them walk into the kitchen carrying the dishes from their dinner while Nicky waits in the dining area.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I do,” Rio says, resisting the urge to say ‘we’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is something wrong?” Agatha asks, having a feeling that there is something Rio isn’t saying, even if she doesn’t really know Rio at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I just… sometimes I don’t feel like I’m enough for him,” Rio admits, admitting that because it is Agatha she is standing with, even if she isn’t actually Agatha at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are,” Agnes says. “From where I am standing you’ve been an incredible mother to him,” Agnes admits, and while Rio is sure Agnes intends for her words to help Rio her words actually do the opposite.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not so sure,” Rio admits, turning towards the sink to avoid looking at Agatha, but as she does, she feels Agath touch her shoulder, and just for a second she allows herself to lean into the touch, and while she would like to allow herself to continue doing that, she knows that with Agatha not being herself it wouldn’t be right. “We should get desert ready,” Rio says, trying to pull away from Agatha being the one of the hardest things she has done.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Agatha asks, and Rio feels her breath against her neck, and Rio closes her eyes for a few moments to allow herself to dwell on what it feels like to be so close to Agatha once again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Unfortunately,” Rio responds, and she heads towards the fridge to get the desert even though she would much rather stay closer to Agatha, and once she has the desert both she and Agatha head back out to re-join Nicky, spending the next couple of hours spending enjoyable time together even if it’s not really Agatha who is with them.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      October 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky’s birthday and in that time, he has returned to school for his second year of high school and even though he was completely against going to school when his mother told him that that’s what he was going to be doing he has actually grown to enjoy it.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, he was giving a really hard time too a whole bunch of people, being a total ass, so I subtly used my magic to trip him over,” Nicky tells his mother, as the two of them do the dishes in the kitchen after dinner.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did anyone see?” Rio asks concerned, as that is her biggest concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope,” Nicky responds, “And he hasn’t given anyone a hard time since,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like the perfect way to deal with bullies,” Rio comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought so,” Nicky responds, and as he does, he realises something. “Oh my god,” Nicky suddenly says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m taller than you,” Nicky says with a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re not,” Rio says, standing up properly, and knowing that if Nicky is actually taller than her then he is taller than Agatha as well.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I am Mom,” Nicky says with a grin. “I’m really taller than you,” Nicky says with a grin, which makes Rio realises he is right. “This is awesome,” Nicky says, grinning from ear to ear, a look which makes him look so much like Agatha, and in response Rio grabs the tap and uses it to spray Nicky with water.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really? Oh, this is war mom,” Nicky says, and the two of them engage in a water fight, both of them using magic when they needed, which results in the two of them spending a lot of time laughing, while half the house, and both of them, get covered in water.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      December 2025
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky realised, he was taller than Rio, and therefore Agatha, and while Nicky allowed himself a little while to enjoy that his mind quickly went to Agatha and how it was something else, she missed out on.
    </p>
<p>
     As he doesn’t want his mama to miss out on anything else Nicky has become even more obsessive about tyring to find a way to loosen the hold Wanda’s spell has on Agatha so it can be broken. While she knows what her son is doing Rio is becoming incredibly concerned about him as it has been days since Nicky left the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Rio says, walking into the living room that is covered in books which Nicky is sitting in the middle of.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Mom?” Nicky asks curious, without looking up from what he is doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to take a break,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Nicky says as he puts down the current book, he is looking at so that he can pick up another.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been on break for four days, and you haven’t left the house for four days,” Rio reminds her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “So? That’s not exactly unusual,” Nicky comments, remembering all the times he didn’t leave a house for long periods of time prior to coming to Westview.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is since we’ve been in Westview,” Rio tells him. “You need to take a break,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t,” Nicky tells his mom. “I need to help Mama,” Nicky tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t help Mama if you’re burnt out,” Rio tells her son. “Take an hour, go for a walk, clear your head and you might even be surprised to find that when you get home you can focus more,” Rio tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going to win this argument am I?” Nicky asks his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you ever before?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Nicky says with a sigh, before marking his page. “Fine,” Nicky says, standing up. “I’ll be back in an hour,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coat and scarf,” Rio says to her son, as he heads towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes Mom,” Nicky says, as he walks to the door, but he pauses and turns back around. “Has anyone ever won an argument with Death?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your Mama has,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” Nicky says amused, as that doesn’t surprise him. “I’ll see you in an hour, Mom,” Nicky says before putting on his coat and scarf and heading out of the house.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After leaving the house Nicky starts to walk towards the town square, purposely avoiding going towards his Mama’s house because considering everything he is feeling incredibly guilty about still not managing to break the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     As he walks around the town square Nicky can’t help but think of his first Christmas in Westview when he, and both his mums, got to spend time together, where they got to have an actual holiday together. Back then Nicky believed it wouldn’t be much longer before he broken the spell, and now two years later he still hasn’t managed to do it, and he’s starting to hate himself for that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, excuses me,” A voice say, snapping Nicky’s out of his thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I’m sorry,” Nicky says, as he looks at the person he basically barrelled into. “Do we know each other?” Nicky asks the other teenager, feeling confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we’ve been sitting next to each other in Spanish all semester,” the boy says, clearly amused, as unknown to Nicky he has been trying to get his attention the entire time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, sorry, I don’t tend to pay much attention in Spanish,” Nicky admits, as because he already speaks Spanish fluently, he tends to use that lesson to do other things, completely ignoring what was going on around him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve noticed, I’m Eddie,” Eddie says, sticking out his hand for Nicky to shake.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Nicky responds, returning the handshake, and the smile Eddie has on his face. “So, um, my moms kicked me out of the house for the next hour, feel like getting some hot chocolate with me?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, the diner’s open,” Eddie responds and the two of them head towards the diner, and even though Nicky is worrying about his Mama, and feeling incredibly guilty that he hasn’t broken the spell, he actually does manage to have a good time with Eddie.

<strong>
      February 2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Two months have passed since Nicky literally ran into Eddie, who he has actually started to date. While Rio is aware he is dating someone she hasn’t met Eddie yet, but Nicky knows that is time to change that fact as he doesn’t want to keep any part of his life from his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, Mom,” Nicky says, as he walks into the living room and finds his mother once again sitting at the window seat that allows her to watch Agatha when she is on the street, something which Nicky has realised her mom is doing a lot more recently.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?” Rio asks, turning away from the window to look at her son. “Is everything okay?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky confirms. “Um, I was just wondering… you know Eddie?” Nicky says, having no other idea how to start the conversation that he wants to have.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your boyfriend? I haven’t had the pleasure yet,” Rio says, though she has checked him out a little, not as much as she would like, but the most she could do without Nicky realising what she was doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about we changed that,” Nicky suggests, and Rio gives him an interested look. “I was thinking I would invite him over for dinner tomorrow,” Nicky explains. “Would that be, okay? I’d like you to actually meet him,” Nicky explains, as he really likes Eddie and because of that he wants him to meet his mother, truthfully, he would like Eddie to meet both his mothers, but he knows how complicated that is, how knows how that is impossible right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, we can do that,” Rio confirms, knowing that she is very much going to enjoy that, as this is the exact opportunity she has been waiting for.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to scare him?” Nicky asks curious, feeling worried about the smirk on his mothers face, as he has a bad feeling about what that look means.
    </p>
<p>
     “I won’t make an effort to,” Rio responds. “But if he gets scared it’s his own fault,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, you’re literally death. Even if people don’t know that you have this….” Nicky starts to say, then trails off.
    </p>
<p>
     “This what, Nicholas?” Rio asks her son, pretending to be annoyed, but she isn’t actually.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vibe,” Nicky finishes, feeling that that is the best description. “Just don’t threaten him Mom, please,” Nicky pleads, as he really likes Eddie, and he wants things to go well between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I won’t explicitly threaten him,” Rio assures her son, knowing that is the best she can do considering the circumstances.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess that’s good enough,” Nicky says, being able to read through the lines to understand his mom will still threaten Eddie, but hopefully Eddie won’t realise that’s what she’s doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, speaking of not knowing I’m death, what does Eddie know about you? About us?” Rio asks curious, being sure that her son was smart enough not to tell him everything, but she is still curious about just how much he has told.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a lot,” Nicky admits, and truthfully, he feels incredibly guilty about that, but after the way he grew up, both before and after he died, he always knew that there was nothing more important than keeping who he really is a secret. “I haven’t told him about my magic, about who you really are,” Nicky admits, having no idea how he is going to do that, if he ever will. “I said we came to Westview because we were searching for something, so that we could have a different kind of life,” Nicky admits, as it was the best explanation he could think to give.
    </p>
<p>
     “All technically true,” Rio realises, feeling a little impressed with the way her son managed to walk the fine line between the truth of what happened and what he could actually tell. “What have you told him about, Mama?” Rio asks curious, as she doesn’t want to accidently contradict something Nicky has already said.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said that she is having problems knowing who she is, that she can’t be with us right now, but that we’re doing everything to help her to be able to come home to us,” Nicky explains. “It was the closest I could get to the truth,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like you did the best you could,” Rio admits, giving her son a sympathetic look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Still feels wrong,” Nicky admits. “I would love Mama to be at dinner, but not as Agnes. I want my real Mama, I want both of you to meet my boyfriend,” Nicky admits, getting upset, as he can’t believe that this is something else his mama is missing out on because he hasn’t figured out how to save her yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, me too,” Rio admits, as she gets up and walks over to her son, who she hugs, knowing that she never thought so much time would past, that Nicky would grow up enough for her to meet his boyfriend, without saving Agatha.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Nicky was nervous to ask his mother if he could invite his boyfriend to dinner that nervousness is nothing compared to the nervousness he feels as it gets closer to dinnertime. While Nicky is cooking Rio, who Nicky has refused to let help as he is insisting on doing it alone, is sitting on the kitchen bench, playing with her knife.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, it’s going to be okay,” Rio assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know it can’t be perfect without Mama, but I want it to be close to it,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It will be, but only if you relax,” Rio tells her son, understanding how she feels about nothing being perfect without Agatha as she feels the same, as there is a knock on the door. “You should get that,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you really have to play with your knife?” Nicky asks his mother, as he walks past her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Rio responds, causing Nicky to roll his eyes, as she jumps from where he is sitting and follows behind her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Nicky mutters, knowing that asking her not to won’t get him anywhere, as he gets to the front door and opens it. “Hi, come in,” Nicky says, greeting his boyfriend with a quick kiss. “Eddie, this is one of my moms, my mom, Rio, Mom, this is Eddie, my boyfriend,” Nicky introduces.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a pleasure to meet you Mrs Scratch,” Eddie greats, as Nicky uses the last name Scratch at school as going by Vidal-Harkness would raise too many questions. “I brought you some chocolates,” Eddie says, as he offers the chocolates to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can call me, Rio, thank you,” Rio says, and the overly friendly tone of voice is at odds with the fact that she is still twirling her knife in her hand in an obviously threatening way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dinning’s room’s through here, I hope you’re hungry, I made a lot of food,” Nicky says, trying to distract Nicky from the fact that his mother is twirling a knife around.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m starving,” Eddie says with a grin, as the three of them head towards the dining room.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, Eddie, have you lived in Westview long?” Rio asks curious, as she starts what Nicky knows to be her version of an interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, not really, only since last year,” Nicky says as they get to the dinning room where they proceed to have dinner during which Rio both threatens and interrogates Eddie. Considering everything Rio does, including spending the entire dinner playing with her knife, Nicky considers it a miracle that Eddie doesn’t go running from the house; something he wouldn’t blame Eddie for if he were to do so.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      May 2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three months have passed since Rio meet Eddie for the first time and it is clear to Nicky that his mother successfully terrified his boyfriend, but thankfully Eddie wasn’t so terrified that he ended his relationship with Nicky. It’s late at night and while Rio is doing her job Nicky is home alone.
    </p>
<p>
     While it’s not unusually for Nicky to be home alone while Rio is doing his job what is unusual is that there is a pretty bad storm. Having spent so much time in the United Kingdom Nicky doesn’t mind storms, in fact, he very much likes them, and because that while pretty much everyone else is inside Nicky is sitting on the front step watching the weather.
    </p>
<p>
     “So cool,” Nicky mutters, as he watches the lighting and everything move in the wind, but everything suddenly becomes a whole lot less cool when he sees the wind breaks the front window to Agatha’s house, and a tree starts to fall straight towards the house. “Not so cool,” Nicky mutters.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Nicky can even think about what he is doing Nicky starts to run towards his Mama’s house, and as he runs, he uses magic to keep the tree from falling on Agatha’s house. Once he is close enough Nicky is able to use his magic to make the tree fall between Agatha’s house and the one next to it, causing no damage to either property.
    </p>
<p>
     After fixing the immediate danger Nicky keeps running towards the house, and he uses his magic to open the front door, making it seem like the wind opened it.
    </p>
<p>
     “AGNES!” Nicky yells, as he hurries into the house, and he sees Agatha in the living area, clearly investigating the broken window.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Anges asks, looking surprised. “There’s a really bad storm out there,” Agatha says, clearly worried about him, even if she has no idea who he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, my door blew open and I saw your window, so I thought I would come see if you were okay,” Nicky lies, it being the first explanation he can think off.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am, my house not so much,” Agnes admits, and as she does Nicky can’t help but wonder, not for the first time, what Agatha is seeing underneath the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about you come stay at our house tonight,” Nicky suggests. “That’s way you can be protected from the storm,” Nicky says to his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure that would be, okay?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m pretty sure Mom will insist on it when she gets home from her job,” Nicky tells Agnes, knowing that while it may be awkward, Rio wouldn’t want Agatha staying in a damaged house, especially not without her powers.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re home alone?” Agnes asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it’s no big deal,” Nicky says with a shrug, as considering all the protections his mom puts in place, and what he can do, he isn’t worried about danger unless one of his moms’ enemies turn up. “But that window damage is,” Nicky says. “So’s the storm,” Nicky says. “I’d really like it if you came and stayed with us tonight,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Agnes responds. “We should go before the storm gets worse,” Agnes says.
    </p>
<p>
     “We really should,” Nicky says, the two of them head out of the house, and as the two of them make their way towards Rio and Nicky’s house Nicky subtly uses his powers to make sure they aren’t hurt by anything, without Agatha realising he did just that.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About an hour after Nicky convinced Agatha to come stay with him and Rio Agatha is fast asleep on the couch, while Nicky is wide awake as he knows he cannot spring his mama being asleep on the couch on his mom. As he gently puts a blanket over his mama Nicky hears the telltale signs that his mother is arriving home and because of that he quickly moves towards the door as he doesn’t want his mother to be blindsided by his mama being asleep on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky? Are you okay?” Rio asks her son concerned, as she knows the storm has been pretty bad.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Nicky assures his mother.  “Mama’s here,” Nicky reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Is she okay?” Rio asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, her front window got destroyed, and I stopped a tree from falling on the house, but she’s okay,” Nicky explains. “I suggested she stay here, I hope that’s okay,” Nicky says to his mom, as while he is pretty confident that it won’t be a problem he can’t be sure.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s beyond okay,” Rio assures her son. “Are you sure that she wasn’t hurt by the glass?” Rio asks worried, wanting to be sure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, as sure as I can be anyway,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says and in response she hugs her son. “I’m glad you’re okay,” Rio says, as she was worried that Nicky could be hurt because of how bad the storm is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine, promise,” Nicky assures his mother. “I might head up to bed if that’s okay,” Nicky says, as he is actually tired.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is, you go get some sleep,” Rio tells her son. “I’ll keep an eye on Mama,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you will,” Nicky says, though he is a little worried about the effect that will have on Rio, as even though she has been doing her best to hide it he can tell how much it hurts her to be on the receiving end of Agatha’s hostility. “Night Mom,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Night Nicky,” Rio says and while Nicky heads upstairs Rio heads into the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking into the living room Rio pauses for a moment, doing her best to prepare herself, then walks into the living room where she sits down next to Agatha. As she sits down next to Agatha Rio realises that she isn’t completely covered in the blanket, so she rectifies that, making sure Agatha is completely covered in the blanket, before makes herself comfortable before doing something she once completely loved doing, watching Agatha sleep.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As Rio doesn’t need to sleep, she is able to watch Agatha all night, something which she didn’t realise just how much she missed doing. Because Rio knows Agatha so well, she is able to tell the second that Agatha starts to wake, and because of that Rio prepares herself for how ‘Agnes’ is going to react to seeing her as that is never something she can predict.
    </p>
<p>
     “You? What are you doing in my house?” Agnes asks, and Rio sees the anger she has gotten used to, but not the hatred, which considering everything is an improvement for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not in your house, Agnes, you’re in mine,” Rio tells her. “Do you remember anything from last night?” Rio asks, knowing that there could be a lot of reasons why Agatha doesn’t remember and because of that she isn’t worried, yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, there was a storm, your son came and got me,” Anges says, and it still hurts Rio not to hear her call Nicky ‘our son’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, your house got pretty damaged,” Rio tells her. “So, you’re welcome to stay here as long as you need,” Rio offers, having no idea if it’s a good idea or not, but it is the one she is making as she needs to know that Agatha is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I appreciate that,” Agnes responds. “Are you sure it won’t be any trouble?” Anges asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m sure,” Rio says, and as Agnes smiles at her Rio can’t help but return the smile and as she does, she feels a flutter in her chest. “I should get started on breakfast,” Rio says, standing up, as she is sure she knows where staring at Agatha will lead to, and she has promised herself that she will not let that happen while Agatha doesn’t know who she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you like some help?” Agnes asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, I’d like that,” Rio responds, as she knows that Agatha isn’t the best cook, but that cooking is always something that Agatha enjoyed trying to figure out because it was something else her mother wouldn’t teach her and because of that Rio always loved cooking food she made.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Agatha responds, and the two of them head into the kitchen where they proceed to make breakfast together, which is exactly how Nicky finds them fifteen minutes later. As he walks into the kitchen and sees both his mother’s trying to cook Nicky quickly joins them and for the first time since he was seven Nicky gets to cooks with both his mothers, something which he truly loves every second off, something which he knows he wants to experience again when Agatha knows who she is.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      September 2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Four months have passed since Nicky got to cook with both his mothers and since then he has turned sixteen, officially gotten his license even though he has been driving for months, and also become even more obsessed with figuring out a way to break the spell his mother is in under.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s early house of the morning on a Friday and while Nicky should be asleep, he is wide awake in his room double, and triple, checking something. As he continues to double and triple check everything, he has written down Nicky feels the kind of hope he hasn’t felt since he and his mom first come to Westview, before they realised Agatha was under a spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it,” Nicky says amazed. “MOM!” Nicky yells as he gets to his feet and runs down the hall to where his mother’s bedroom is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky? What’s wrong?” Rio asks terrified as she opens the door, wondering what could be so huge that it would cause her son to yell like he just did.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’ve done it,” Nicky says amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Think you’ve done what?” Rio asks confused, but just from the way Nicky is behaving Rio is sure that whatever he has realised is a big deal.
    </p>
<p>
     “Figured out how to loosen the hold the spell has on Mama, and then once we do that, how to actually break it,” Nicky tells his mother, who can barely believe what her son is saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me everything,” Rio requests, feeling hope, but after everything that has happened, how long has passed, she is actually terrified to actually hope.

     Chapter 14

<p>
<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you for the incredible response to the last chapter. I really hope you like this one. Next chapter will be out in about twelve hours.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Okay, so the main problem with the spell is that it’s become so intwined with Mama, it’s surrounding everything like a spiderweb,” Nicky says to his mom as he sits down on the ground and shows his Mama what he has figured out.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s why you have been trying to figure out ways to loosen, or crack, the hold first before we try to break the spell,” Rio realises, as she sits down on the ground too.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Nicky says with a nod, as he long ago accepted that he cannot just break the spell he needs to loosen the hold it has first. “Mama’s birthday last year we realised we could subtly manipulate the way she perceives reality,” Nicky reminds his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “And were both worried about doing that on a larger scale,” Rio remembers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, which is why, the start of my plan, is to influence the next role Mama plays in her perception of reality,” Nicky explains. “A few days ago, when you were doing your job, I was with mama and I kept talking about engineering and how that is such an interesting job, I made sure that at least once I was touching her when I mentioned it and then yesterday when Mama’s reality reset…” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s an engineer,” Rio says, with an amazed look on her face. “You influenced what she became,” Rio says, amazed, realising that she should have thought of trying that because she knows how connected Nicky and Agatha’s magicks are.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sems like it,” Nicky tells his mother. “Which means if I have done it once I can do it again, but this time make her believe she is a detective,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Detective?” Rio asks, wondering why her son has chosen that particular carer.
    </p>
<p>
     “So that she can follow the clues we will leave for a case,” Nicky explains. “A case of what happened to Wanda, the Darkhold, and even Mama herself,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “And if she is following the leads, because it fits with her perception of reality, the spell won’t fight against it, won’t prevent her from putting the pieces together, and the grip will be lessened. There may even be cracks put in,” Rio realises, feeling that the logic makes sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, and once those cracks start to show, once it’s clear they exist, I going to lock onto them and cast a magic to magic, blood to blood spell to increase those cracks and then release her,” Nicky tells his mother, knowing that to do that he will have to have both him and his mama bleed at the same time, have their blood mix, which is going to be the hard part. “My research indicates that it might be the only thing strong enough,” Nicky explains, feeling that it’s not a certainty but that it feels like the closest to a certainty they have had. “What do you think?” Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s a brilliant plan, and that it just may work,” Rio says, as she starts to flicker through Nicky’s notes to have a look, realising that he has really done his research, considered almost everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “But you’re not completely convinced,” Nicky realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not because of your plan, your thinking, it’s all solid,” Rio admits, as she continues to read what Nicky has written. “But we’ve got to consider that this just any magic, it’s chaos magic performed by the Scarlett Witch,” Rio tells her son. “Even if she’s gone, I spent enough time listening to Mama talk about magick like this to know that it can be adaptive,” Rio explains, feeling worried that the spell could adapt to what Nicky does.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re worried it could adapt to my spell,” Nicky realises, feeling that that is a real concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, we’ve seen the ways it has already adapted; if we try this, we’re only going to get one shot,” Rio admits, and as she does Nicky thinks about what his mom said and as he does, he gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about the Witches Road?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “The spell may adapt, you’re right about that, but if this works the way I intend it to it will take time to adapt. So, what if we use that time to go down the Witches Road? It will give us what we want most and want I want most is for Mama to be permanently free from the spell, for us to be a real family,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s an incredibly dangerous idea,” Rio tells her son, having a bad feeling about that. “Most people don’t survive The Road,”
    </p>
<p>
     “You and Mama did before,” Nicky reminds her, as he has heard the story more than once.
    </p>
<p>
     “Barely,” Rio admits, and then she feels a familiar tug. “Nicky, I have to go do my job, but I’m going to think about your plan, okay, and we’ll talk about it when I get home,” Rio tells her son, not wanting him to think she is dismissing his idea, because she’s not, she is seriously considering it, she just has a few concerns.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have school soon,” Nicky reminds his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can stay home, or we can talk after school, your choice,” Rio says and Nicky nods. “You should be proud,” Rio assures her son, wanting to make that clear. “This is an incredible plan, but I just need to think of everything that could go wrong to see if we came come up with solutions, so that we can be as prepared as possible,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Mom,” Nicky says, knowing he will start to figure out the same thing.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be home as soon as I can,” Rio tells her son before standing up, kissing the top of his head, and leaving.
    </p>
<p>
     After his mother leaves Nicky goes back to his research, trying to figure out ways to solve the potential problems that his mother has pointed out.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A couple of hours after Rio left to do her job she is returning home, and after something she discovered while she was doing her job Rio desperately hopes that Nicky has decided to stay home from school.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Rio calls as she hurries into the house, knowing that if he is not home, she will have to go check on him at school and potentially pull him out of school.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Mom?” Nicky says from the living area where he is sitting on the couch and the second, she sees her son Rio hurries over to him and hugs him. “What’s wrong? What’s happened?” Nicky asks his mother, feeling confused, as he returns the hug, as it’s not often his mother greats him like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you alright?” Rio asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m fine,” Nicky assures his mother, as the two of them break apart. “What’s going on?” Nicky asks worried, as they both sit down on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “While I was gone, I heard whispers that the Salem Seven are searching for both you and Mama, that they think they’re getting close,” Rio tells her son, knowing they have a little bit time before they are found, but not a whole lot.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve both been in the same place for almost three years why haven’t they found us sooner?” Nicky asks, then as soon as he asks the answer comes to him. “Because there is still too much interference from Wadna’s spell,” Nicky realises, knowing that because of Wanda’s spell it is difficult for anyone outside the town to detect Magick use within Westview, something which he and Rio have been using to their advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what I think, but it seems like they are confident that they are getting close,” Rio explains to her son. “And we have to do something,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not running and leaving Mama,” Nicky tells his mother, as there is no way he will do that, and he knows that because of the spell Agnes will not leave Westview.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not suggesting that,” Rio assures her son, as she would never suggest that. “I think we need to give your plan a try, but with one more addition,” Rio tells her son, knowing that he is not going to like what she is going to suggest, truthfully, she doesn’t like it, but that it is the best way she can think to protect him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What addition?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I cast a Sigil on you to protect your identity, to hide who you from everyone until we’ve gone down The Road and confirmed the spell is permanently broken, and Mama has her power back,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? No!” Nicky objects. “If you do that, you’ll forget who I am too,” Nicky reminds his mother, his voice breaking, as it’s bad enough that his mama doesn’t know who he is, he doesn’t want his mom to forget him too.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but I need to be the one who performs the Sigil because it is the only way to guarantee your identity will be protected from everyone,” Rio tells her son, and she knows that unless she is the one who performs the Sigil it won’t work on her or other powerful beings.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t I cast it? that way you will remember who I am,” Nicky tells his mother, who shakes her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to know who you are so you can protect yourself. So, you know who is coming after you and why,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get that you want me to be protected from everyone else, but why you and Mama?” Nicky asks his mother, as that’s part that doesn’t make sense to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because we do need to go down the Witches Road, and if Mama knows who you are, that you’re alive, she would never risk the Witches Road. She would sacrifice herself first,” Rio says, knowing that. “But if she doesn’t become herself again, magic and all, before the Salem Seven attack I’m going to lose her, and you, I can’t handle that,” Rio says as while she is terrified about her son going down the Witches Road she knows it’s the best option they have, and she also knows that even if Agatha doesn’t know who Nicky is consciousness she will try to protect him, she has seen that over the past three years.
    </p>
<p>
     While she also hates herself for even suggesting it, and she know she will likely get hatred and anger from Agatha, she knows it will be worth it if both Agatha and Nicky are okay, something she can’t guarantee if it’s up to just her to fight the Salem Seven as there are rules about what she can and cannot do, rules she cannot break; no matter how much she may want to.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate this,” Nicky admits, feeling frustrated. “I thought I was finally going to get Mama back and now I have to lose you too, it’s not fair?” Nicky asks, feeling frustrated, as it seems like his mom is set on this Sigil thing and there is nothing he can say otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not forever,” Rio tells him. “The sigil will be destroyed on his own, at the end of the road, when it’s not needed, but we will create a way for you to destroy it sooner, if necessary,” Rio tells her son, having gone back and forth on whether to make it so Nicky could break the Sigil if needed and ultimately deciding it’s a necessary failsafe to put in place just in case “But Nicky, that would be an only in case of emergency,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I figured that,” Nicky admits.  “But isn’t this Sigil going to make everything even more complicated? How do I even get Mama to go down The Road if she doesn’t know me? How do I even make it so you can join us on The Road when I am not supposed to know who you are?” Nicky asks, seeing some flaws in his moms plan.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Sigil may make things more complicated, but you’re also going be able to use that,” Rio tells her son. “Find a way to trigger it in front of Mama, she will be curious, and that interest will lead to her deciding it’s worth it going down the Road,” Rio tells her son, knowing that because she knows Agatha, knows she would not be able to resist a mystery like that. “As for getting me to the Road you need a coven to access it, Mama knows that,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “But what if she doesn’t approach you?” Nicky asks his mother in a gentle voice as he has seen the way ‘Agnes’ reacts to Rio in every reality and because of that he is worried that his Mama won’t even consider his mom for the coven when she doesn’t know he is alive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Death comes easy on the Road,” Rio admits. “Sooner or later, I will be called to do my job, and I’ll stick around when I realise it’s Agatha there, whether she likes it or not. You just do everything you can to make sure it’s not you or mama I need to collect,” Rio tells her son, knowing that even without knowing Nicky is alive she won’t be able to resist staying away from Agatha on The Road if she is called.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll try,” Nicky says, though he isn’t sure how he feels arranging for people to come on the road who may die.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio tells her son, and the two of them proceed to go over their plan several more times and figure out a few specific details that they know they need to decide on. As they discuss everything Rio knows that Nicky isn’t a big fan of the Sigil idea, so she does her best to try and convince him that it is necessary.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      October 9th 2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three weeks have passed since Nicky figured out a way to break the spell on his Mama, since Rio discovered that the Salem Seven is getting close to both Nicky and Agatha, and ever since then the two of them have obsessively been working on their plan. While Nicky is still not a big fan of the sigil idea, he has accepted that it is necessary as both he and Rio know that it’s only a matter of time before the Salem Seven make their move.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s a Friday afternoon and Nicky is arriving home, walking straight into the living room where he and Rio have set up a board which has the steps of their plans all over it.
    </p>
<p>
     “How was school?” Rio asks from where she is staring at the board, as Nicky walks into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, I told Eddie we are going away this weekend, that we may be gone next week to, so he doesn’t try to come over or question why he can’t get in contact with me,” Nicky tells his mom, as he puts his bag down then walks over to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not technically a lie, good choice,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I thought so,” Nicky admits, though he does feel bad about lying to his boyfriend. “Have you been staring at this all day?” Nicky asks his mother curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty much,” Rio admits. “I just want to make sure we’ve got everything covered,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we do,” Nicky admits. “I also think you’re right and that fact that even after I break the spell Mama may have to claw her way out of it herself,” Nicky admits, knowing that he will do everything he can to break the spell, but it will ultimately be up to his mama to take the last step.
    </p>
<p>
     “It would make sense considering what we know how the spell works,” Rio admits. “And it might take some time,” Rio admits, though she doesn’t expect that to take more than a few hours.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, that’s factored in,” Nicky says, looking between everything on the board. “So, we know based on how long she stays in each reality that Mama’s reality will change at midnight, is this it? Is it time?” Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Rio confirms, turning to look at her son. “Are you ready for this?” Rio asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not sure,” Nicky admits. “But I know I don’t want to wait anymore,” Nicky admits, both he and Rio knowing that after the last whispers she has heard from the Salem Seven that they cannot wait any longer, and that even if the Salem Seven weren’t a factor neither of them would want to. “So, I’ll head to Mama’s, try to influence her next persona, and then in the morning we’ll see if we succeeded,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “And if we have, I’ll play my role in her reality and give her more clues,” Rio says. “Then we cast the Sigil,” Rio says, knowing that they have to do the elements of their plan in a very specific order.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky says, in an almost disappointed tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I know you don’t like the Sigil, but it’s necessary,” Rio tells her son, who she knows has been trying to think of another way to protect himself since they came up with the plan.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just because I know that doesn’t mean I have to like it,” Nicky admits. “You and Mama both not knowing who I am, it’s not something I can like,” Nicky tells his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me either,” Rio confirms, having made it clear over the past few weeks that while it is her suggestion and it is what they are going to do, she doesn’t like it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky says with a sigh. “Let’s go over everything one more time than I’ll head over,” Nicky tells his mom, who nods, and that is just what they do.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About half an hour after Nicky got home from school, he and his mom have gone over all elements of their plan one more time and he is walking towards Agatha’s door once again carrying a basket of baked goods he made. As he gets close to the door Nicky pauses and takes a deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can do this, Nicky,” Nicky mutters to himself before walking to the familiar door and knocking.
    </p>
<p>
     Seconds after he knocked the door opens to reveal Agatha who in her current version of reality thinks she is a handyperson and because of that she has several spoons hanging from her belt, as she believes they are tools.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Agnes, I know you have been working hard so I thought I would bring you some snacks,” Nicky explains, offering her the basket.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s so sweet, come in,” Agnes says. “Come in,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Nicky says as they walk in into the house. “Here,” Nicky says, offering the basket to her, and as their hands touch at the same time Nicky knows that’s his cue. “Did you watch that true crime documentary last night?” Nicky asks, purposely keeping hold of the basket so that he can continue to touch his mama’s hand. “The one with the Scarlett haired women who no one could identify, wouldn’t be amazing to be the detective who solved that?” Nicky asks, finally pulling away form his mama once he has said what he needs to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I guess it might be,” Agnes says, looking curious. “What can you tell me about it? it sounds fascinating,” Agnes says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I can tell you everything,” Nicky says, with a grin, as the two of them head towards the kitchen and he proceeds to spend the next hour planting as many seeds as possible to influence what Agatha’s next version of reality becomes.

     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I hope you like how I am handling the ‘episodes’, some will be closer to cannon than others. Next chapter will be up in twelve or so hours.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After a night where Nicky got basically no sleep, and Rio didn’t ‘rest’ like she tends to do as they were so worried about what they are trying to do, the two of them are up early and are once again in their living room. As it gives them the exact view, they need both Rio and Nicky are looking through the bay window watching Agatha, who is seemingly taking pictures of a neighbour’s lawn.
    </p>
<p>
     “That could be Mama seeing a body,” Nicky realises, though he knows it’s hard to be sure as he isn’t seeing what she is seeing. “Do you think we did it?” Nicky asks his mother, wanting to know what she is thinking. “Do you think we did actually influence Mama’s reality?” Nicky asks, as that’s what it seems like to him, but he wants to know what Rio thinks.
    </p>
<p>
     “It definitely seems like it,” Rio confirms, feeling hope that they are actually going to pull this off, but she also knows that they cannot get ahead of herself, that what they are trying to do is too important to let that happen. “Okay, time for me to get ready to do my part,” Rio says, reaching out and placing a comforting hand on Nicky’s shoulder, which she squeezes, before walking away, heading upstairs while Nicky continues to watch his mama, taking notice of everything, so he can try to figure out just how she is perceiving everything.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after Rio and Nicky first saw Agatha take picture of a neighbour’s lawn Rio, who has gotten changed into an outfit to fit with Agatha’s reality even though it’s not actually necessary, is approaching Agatha’s house. As she walks towards the house Rio notices that a neighbour, who’s name Rio has never bothered to learn in the last three years, is standing in the doorway, clearly talking to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now get to the part I’m not gonna like,” Rio hears Agatha say and she has to resist the urge to laugh at that perfect opening.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here I am,” Rio says, as she walks into Agatha’s view.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, fancy dirt always attracts the attention of the feds,” Agnes says, and Rio knows she can make this work.
    </p>
<p>
     “She thinks she is a detective today, solving a murder,” The neighbour says to Rio, not addressing Agatha as he knows that Agatha will hear what she wants to hear. “She was walking around so I just wanted to make sure she was okay,” The neighbour says, and Rio can admit that that is one thing she has appreciated about Westview, that everyone looks out for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably a good idea, but don’t worry, I can look out for her today,” Rio tells the neighbour, hoping that by doing that she will be able to keep everyone else away from Agatha while she and Nicky do what they have to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eat my ass, Chief,” Agnes suddenly says, and Rio has to laugh that, as it is times like that when she sees the flicker of the true Agatha show through.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll leave you to it, good luck,” The neighbour says to Rio, before walking away, and after he walks away Rio walks into the house, closing the door behind her, and sits down across from Agatha, looking around as she does in hopes that she will get some kind of hint that will tell her what Agatha is seeing the environment around her as.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been a long time,” Rio says, knowing that ever since the last time she and Nicky made an explicated attempt to break the spell that Agatha always sees her as someone from her past, so she might as well use that to her advantage, might as well use that as an opening.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing here?” Agnes asks, and Rio isn’t at all surprised to hear the hostility in her voice, as that is something she has unfortunately gotten used to over the last three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “My job,” Rio answers, doing so for two reasons, one is because she knows that it will fit with the version of reality she assumes Agatha is seeing, and the second is because she knows the anger that Agatha feels towards her job so she hopes that by mentioning it, considering it is a mundane detail connected to strong emotions, she can cause a crack.
    </p>
<p>
     “You wanna take control of my investigation,” Agatha says, and Rio has to bite the corner of her cheek at that as there are as so many other thing she would say to that, but because she knows it won’t get what she really wants she just instead spreads out a little in the chair she is sitting in, knowing that Agatha is watching her closely even if she doesn’t know what Agatha is actually seeing.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, if you wanna take control… you can be,” Rio says, purposely using a tone of voice she knows Agatha has always liked.
    </p>
<p>
     “She… the body was moved across state lines. Is that your play?” Agatha asks, and Rio feels some satisfaction that she can still cause Agatha to be flustered, even when she doesn’t even know who she is, but just like every time she has gotten closer to Agatha in the past three years, she refuses to do anything about it when Agatha isn’t herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this really how you see yourself?” Rio asks, once again trying to cause a crack, but when Agatha doesn’t say anything about that she knows she has to give more clues so that Agatha can start to put things together. “Sure, let’s talk about the case,” Rio says, knowing that will help with the ultimate goal. “What are your theories? How’d she end up in the ravine?” Rio asks, saying ravine as that will fit with the seeds Nicky planted the day before but also knowing that if it is not right Agatha will hear whatever fits with her reality.
    </p>
<p>
     “No drag marks, thinking the perp carried her,” Agnes comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, seems logically,” Rio says, picking up one of the many, probably empty, files that Agatha has lying around and waking over to her. “But you don’t really believe that because… no tracks for the perp,” Rio says, as she sits right next to Agatha, assuming that in Agatha’s reality she will see her opening a file. “Not a leaf disturbed before Forensics showed up. It’s almost like she just magically appeared,” Rio says, purposely moving he hands in the exact way she knows Agatha moves her hands when using her magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s stick to reality here,” Agatha says with a scoff, and Rio knows that she has to temporarily dial back her attempts to put cracks in the spell otherwise she risks the spell ‘fighting back’ in a sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Rio says, crossing her arms, planning on taking her next cue from Agatha, as that is the only way she can use the conversion to her advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     “If there’s one thing we can agree on, it’s that these cases are always about the place. The specific small town, the history of it, the people in it, the secrets buried beneath it. That’s where the answers lie,” Agnes tells Rio, who once again realises that she has an opening to put a crack in the spell, to loosen the hold the spell has on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, who better to solve the mystery than one of Westview’s very own?” Rio asks, knowing that in every version of reality Agnes has lived in Westview a long time. “You’ve lived here your whole life. Isn’t that true… Agnes?” Rio asks, putting an emphasis on the name Agnes to make Agatha think that there is something wrong with that, and in response Agatha gets up and walks to the door, telling Rio that she has reached the limits of how she can put back against the spell for now.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want you here,” Agnes says and because she has heard Agatha say that a lot over the past three years Rio isn’t even phased by that, so she gets up and walks to the door as well.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te Veo,” Rio says to Agatha before leaving, knowing she has done what she can to put cracks in the spell and now they have to give Agatha time to dwell on what she has said, to think about the clues she and Nicky left, which will hopefully cause cracks in the spell to form, cracks that Rio knows Nicky needs to cast the spells that he hopes will release Agatha.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “How’d it go?” Nicky asks, the second Rio walks back into their house, not long after she left Agatha’s house, as the entire time Rio has been gone Nicky has been wondering, and worrying, about what was going on between his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “As well as it could,” Rio tells her son, wanting to be optimistic but also not wanting Nicky to be disappointed if it doesn’t work out. “She thought I was an FBI agent so I gave a few more clues, I think I might have said somethings that could cause cracks,” Rio tells her son, feeling cautiously optimistic but at the same time she is terrified that they aren’t going to be successful.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, and then he notices exactly what his mother is wearing. “What’s with the outfit? You know that Mama would have just imagined you in whatever fit with her version of reality, so why did you dress up?” Nicky asks curious, as that doesn’t make sense to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had a point to make,” Rio says with a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I don’t want to know anymore,” Nicky admits, knowing his mother well enough to know that, and Rio laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good choice,” Rio says, walking over to her son. “Nicky, there is something I want to tell you before we do the Sigil,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks confused, having no idea what else his mom could want to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am so proud of you, I love you so much,” Rio tells her son, wanting to make that clear before he deals with a version of her who doesn’t know who he is, before hugging her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Nicky responds, feeling his mother kiss his cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “And Mama loves you too,” Rio tells her son as she breaks apart from her son. “When the spell breaks, you’re going to spend time with a version of Mama who will put on a persona she uses to protect herself,” Rio tells her son, feeling the need to give the warning.
    </p>
<p>
     “What does that mean?” Nicky asks, confused, but he does have a bad feeling about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It means she will be what people expect her to be, she will let anyone you interact with believe the worst in her,” Rio tells her son, knowing that she has always hated when Agatha does that, but it’s a side effect of what Evanora did to her that Agatha can’t shake.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s awful,” Nicky says with a frown, not wanting that for his mama. “So, if someone is hostile to her….”
    </p>
<p>
     “She will be hostile back,” Rio finishes, with a nod, feeling glad that Nicky understands what she is saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s because of Evanora, isn’t it?” Nicky asks and Rio tenses at her son actually saying the name of his Mama’s abuser. “Everything she did to mama that you won’t tell me,” Nicky says as while his mom has said enough for him to put some pieces together, he knows that there is a hell of a lot that he doesn’t know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio confirms. “Nicky, I haven’t told you what Evanora did because you don’t need to know, and because Mama wouldn’t want you to know,” Rio admits, knowing that without a doubt. “But what you do need to know is that you should not take any hostility Mama shows you personally, it’s how she protects herself,” Rio tells her son. “When she finds out she has been under the control of another for three years, and that she doesn’t have her magic, she is going to be feeling vulnerable and your Mama hates feeling vulnerable,” Rio says, knowing exactly why that is, but it is something she would never, even consider, telling their son. “Just keep that in mind when interacting with her before she knows who you are,” Rio says, desperately hoping that by trying to protect herself Agatha doesn’t say, or do, anything that hurts Nicky as she knows the effect that will have on both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will,” Nicky confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “And even though Mama doesn’t have her active magic, no matter what….” Rio starts to say
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t use my magic against her,” Nicky finishes. “I know,” Nicky assures Rio, as she has made that clear to him multiple times over the past three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says, as the last thing she wants is for Nicky to accidently use his magic against his mother because she knows exactly what would happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got to cast the Sigil soon, don’t we?” Nicky asks, knowing that this is the part of the plan he has been dreading.
    </p>
<p>
     “We do,” Rio confirms. “I will be unconscious for a little while after we cast it,” Rio says, knowing that that is because she has so much ‘knowledge’ connected to Nicky being alive again, that will have to be ‘hidden’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which is why I’m not approaching Mama until after sunset,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “And we also want to give the best chance for more cracks to form,” Rio reminds her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I know,” Nicky confirms. “So, this damn Sigil, I can trigger it if I say my name?” Nicky asks, wanting to go over what he hates one more time just to make sure he hasn’t forgotten anything important.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, both Nicky Vidal-Harkness or Nicholas Scratch, and any variation of it,” Rio tells her son. “It will also be triggered if you talk about your life or anything about your identity that could reveal who you are,” Rio tells her son, who nods. “Do you remember the phase to destroy it?” Rio asks, wanting to double check.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky says, and he speaks the phase to break the Sigil, a phase in a language only he and Rio speak.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says approvingly. “Nicky, only use it in an emergency, when you really need us to know who you are,” Rio tells her son. “The second the Sigil is destroyed everyone, including the Salem Seven and every other enemy Mama and I have made over the centuries are going to know who you are, which means I am serious when I say you can only destroy it if it’s an emergency,” Rio warns her son. “As hard as it may be just being around Mama and I when we don’t know who you are that’s not an emergency,” Rio tells her son, needing to make that clear, even if it is harsh.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have good instincts, trust them,” Rio tells her son. “I know you’ll know when there is an emergency otherwise the Sigil will be destroyed when we reach the end of The Road,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Nicky says with a nod. “Still hate it though,” Nicky admits, wanting to once more makes that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio tells her son before hugging him tightly. “Keep your knife with you at all times, but try not to let Mama see it,” Rio tells her son, knowing that Agatha will be able to identify it as the knife she gave Nicky is identical to hers, as she continues to hug him as she doesn’t want to let him go.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will,” Nicky assures his mother, as he continues to hug her tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few minutes Rio and Nicky continue to hug each other, both knowing that the next time they see each other Rio will have no idea who Nicky is, which is something neither of them are trying to think about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, we should probably let go at some point,” Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio says, and she places a kiss on her son’s head before reluctantly letting him go. “I love you so much, you and Mama are everything to me, always have been, always will be,” Rio tells her son. “Even if it doesn’t seem like it after the Sigil is in place,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, you’ve shown me that every single day of my life,” Nicky tells his mother. “You should probably cast that Sigil before we change our minds,” Nicky tells his mother, being sure that they are close to doing so and while he doesn’t like the Sigil idea, he knows that it necessarily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we should,” Rio says, taking a step back from her son, and while she knows it’s necessary that it’s the best way to keep Nicky safe, to make sure Agatha gets her powers back which she is going to need to face the Salem Seven, Rio knows she would give anything not to do what she is about to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “It will be okay, Mom,” Nicky says, even though he isn’t sure he believes that, because he doesn’t want his mother to feel more guilty than she already does.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” Rio says, and she proceeds to cast the Sigil that will protect her son’s identity from everyone, including her.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next couple of minutes Nicky watches as his mother casts the Sigil and he knows the second it is in place as he watches his mother fall to the ground. Hurrying over to his mother Nicky checks to make sure he is okay, and to Nicky’s absolute relief she seems to be fine, or as fine as she can be without knowing who he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll make you proud Mom, I’ll be strong,” Nicky promises his mother. “I’ll help Mama, and we’ll finish The Road, we’ll be together again,” Nicky says before leaning down and places a gentle kiss on his mother’s forehead. “I love you,” Nicky says before heading to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Once he gets to the door Nicky looks back at his mom one last time before walking out of the house, knowing that he needs to be strong because his Mom and Mama, even if they don’t know, are counting on him, and he will never let them down.

     : Thank you for the support. Hope you like this chapter, next update will be in about twelve hours. I just want to say the way you have all been responding to this story is absolutely incredible, I am so thankful for the incredible support you have given.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     In the hours that follow Rio casting the Sigil to hide Nicky’s identity Nicky spends his time walking around Westview, apart from when he has some food, until after sunset. Once the sunsets Nicky knows it’s time to put the next step into motion and so he makes his way to his Mama’s house, but as he approaches the house Nicky sees something he wasn’t expecting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Nicky asks surprised, as he sees Rio, who is still wearing the outfit she was wearing earlier, knock on the door. “That wasn’t part of the plan,” Nicky mutters, wondering what the hell is going on, as he didn’t plan for this, but it seems like with the Sigil in place he is going to have to deal with his moms doing unexpected things; which is going to make everything a lot more complicated.
    </p>
<p>
     As his mother walks into his mama’s house Nicky knows that he needs to have some idea what is going on before he can do the next step of the plan. Hurrying to the house Nicky makes his way to the front window, where he quietly opens from the outside, something which he knew was possible because he’s spent so much time at Agatha’s house, so that he can hear what his moms are saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, she’s a rookie, granted, but I say to her, has the suspect been seen in the last twenty-four hours?” Agnes asks as she gives Rio a teacup, but Nicky very much doubts she is seeing a teacup in her reality. “And she says, ‘only on TikTok,” Agnes says, before sitting down across from Rio. “And then I say, we’ll, did you learn anything? And she says, that I was using the wrong foundation brush,” Agnes says, and both Agatha and Rio laugh, Nicky knowing that that is a big dela with Agatha doesn’t know who Rio is and when Rio has no memory that he is alive. “Anyway… I have a lead in the case,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not why I came over,” Rio says, leaning forward, as from her point of view, without knowing about Nicky, she has discovered that Agatha is trapped under the spell and wants to help her escape it, having no idea that Nicky is in the process of doing exactly that. “But go ahead,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “There was a car wreck, about an hour before time of death,” Agnes explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eastview,” Agatha answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eastview? See, I thought you turned into a pumpkin that far afield,” Rio jokes, which tells Nicky she still knows parts of what’s going on even if she doesn’t know about him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I travel, I’m worldly,” Agnes objects.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where have you travelled?” Rio asks, with a laugh and as she does it quickly becomes clear to both Nicky and Rio that Agatha is becoming distressed, and because of that Nicky knows what he has to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, what about the car wreck?” Nicky hears Rio ask.
    </p>
<p>
     As he knows that he needs to get close to his mama so that he can cast the spells he needs to cast, ideally without his mom becoming involved as she will have more questions than the current version of his mama, Nicky knows that he has to play into his mother’s reality.
    </p>
<p>
     Coming to a decision Nicky makes his way to the back of his mama’s house, and enters through the back door, knowing that it will be unlocked as it always is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, how I am going to do this?” Nicky asks himself as he knows that what he needs to do is draw his ama away from his mom, as he looks around. “Crash and run, sorry Mom, Mama,” Nicky decides, feeling a little bad about interrupting whatever conversation they are having, and he uses his magic to cause several of the appliances to be knocked over.
    </p>
<p>
     “HEY!” Agatha’s voice yells, and Nicky purposely waits until his mama sees him before he goes running.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the next minute or so Nicky runs so that his mama would chase him, and as she starts to struggle Nicky purposely trips over in her front yard, to allow his mother to ‘arrest’ him.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re under arrest,” Agnes tells Nicky, pulling him to his feet, and while Nicky knows it would be a perfect opportunity to cast the blood-to-blood spell he knows that he needs to make sure that there are cracks in the spell, that it has loosed it’s hold on his mama, before doing so otherwise he risks the blood-to-blood spell not working.
    </p>
<p>
     After getting Nicky to his feet Agatha brings him back inside where she sits him down on the living room chair his mother was sitting on earlier. Thanks to his magic Nicky knows that his mom is no longer in the house, he assumes she decided that she didn’t want to be a part of Agatha’s hallucinations anymore, and his mama puts a folder, as well as duct tape and rope, on the coffee table. As he sees the action Nicky, who is glad his mother didn’t bind his hands, suspects that she thinks they are in an interrogation room, which he may be able to use to his advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, I’m curious, what compelled you to break into the home of a decorated detective?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Decorated detective? That really fits you,” Nicky says to his mother, as he knows she is an infamous witch, so decorated detective fits, he also knows that she will hear what she needs to hear, so unless he can use the situation to his advantage it won’t matter what he says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s talk about you, then, you little dirtbag,” Agnes says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ouch, that hurts,” Nicky admits, but because it’s not the worse thing his mama could say he doesn’t let it get to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is B&amp;E your regular gig?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not breaking when the door is unlocked,” Nicky responds, smirking slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     “What were you looking for in my house?” Agnes asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “You actually,” Nicky says as Agnes moves closer to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “See, the things you’re roasting me for are the things that make me dangerous,” Agnes says. “So, you wanna keep poking the bear?” Agnes asks, as she leans in close.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not particularly, but I might have to achieve what I want,” Nicky admits, watching his mother carefully so that he can use any opportunity to test whether there are any cracks in the spell yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “What were you after?” Agatha asks her son, as she moves back to her chair.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, so, many things,” Nicky admits. “But let’s see how you respond to me saying the Witches Road,” Nicky says, as that will tell him if there are any cracks currently in the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “What road?” Agatha asks, and Nicky grins, as that is an opening he has been waiting for.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Witches Road, focus on what I am saying, on what you know deep down is real,” Nicky says, as he wants to make sure there are a few more cracks in the spell, that it’s hold has loosed a lot, before he tries to break it completely.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was on a road this morning,” Agatha says. “It led to something pretty awful. New question. Where were you last night between the hours of one and three am?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Laying wide awake in my bed down the road thinking about how I am going to help you,” Nicky answers honestly, as Agatha starts to play with her pen, trying to get it to work, and if he wasn’t so used to the way Agatha can be under the spell Nicky would be laughing at her behaviour, but because he is he doesn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Asleep in bed,” Agnes writes down. “Total loser? Or totally lying? Let’s find out,” Agnes basically yells, as she shows pictures to Nicky, pictures that he assumes are the ones he was taking earlier. “What do you know about this?” Agnes asks, as she basically slams the pictures down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, so, so, much,” Nicky comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me about her!” Agnes exclaims, and Nicky decides to see if he can put a few more cracks in Agatha’s perspective before casting the blood to blood, magic to magic spell. “Tell me what happened to her!”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you talking about? These are just flowers,” Nicky says, knowing that how Agatha responds to that will tell him if their plan to put cracks in the spell, to loosen the hold, is working.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asks, picking up one of the picture, which tells him that things seem to be working exactly how he and his mom were hoping they would.
    </p>
<p>
     “They are just pictures, of someone’s front yard or something,” Nicky says and as he does, he notices his mother look at the painting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you keep looking at the painting?” Nicky asks, and as he does, he sees his mother look between the painting, and the pictures she took earlier, a look of confusion on his face which tells Nicky they have cracks, which means it’s time for the next part of the spell.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha is so focused on trying to make sense of what she is doing Nicky is able to pull his knife and cut his hand, before moving towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”  Agatha asks confused, as she sees Nicky move.
    </p>
<p>
     “Helping you,” Nicky tells his mama as he moves closer to her and quickly slices her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “HEY!” Agatha yells, as Nicky grasps her hand with his own bloody hand, focuses on what he needs to focus on, and starts to recite the two spells he has memorised, the spells that will increase the cracks in reality Agatha is experiencing, and then the second one which increases those cracks enough to break the spells hold. “What… what… have you done…” Agatha says confused, when Nicky has finished his spells.
    </p>
<p>
     “Everything I could, now it’s up to you, claw your way out,” Nicky tells his mother, desperately hoping he will succeed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not going anywhere,” Agatha tells her son, and to his annoyance she uses the rope to tie his legs, and hands. “You’re going to stay right here,” Agatha says as she takes him towards the hall closest, accidently dropping a locket that Nicky knows means a hell of a lot to her, as they go.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously? Putting me in the closet before I have a chance to come out to you? Feels rude,” Nicky says, before his mama puts tape over his mouth and pushes him into the closet. “Come on, Mama, break through,” Nicky thinks to himself and as he does, he feels something that makes him feel relief, his powers telling him his mom is now in the house too, as he suspects she realised the Agatha was close to coming to the surface again and she wanted to be around when that happened. “Help her, Mom,” Nicky thinks as while knows it isn’t a part of the plan, he also knows his mom well enough, has heard her talk about his Mama enough, to know that if there is anyone who can help his mama claw out from below the weight of the spell now that he made the opening then it’s his mom.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Nicky is out in the hall closet Rio and Agatha are both in the kitchen, which to Agatha appears to be the morgue.
    </p>
<p>
     “Case close, then?” Rio asks Agatha, who has just been muttering about the body she is seeing, a body which in her perception of reality is that of the Scarlett Witch.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did she die?” Agatha asks Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wrong question,” Rio says with a scoff, as form her point of view Wanda doesn’t matter, all that matters is Agatha. “That witch is gone, and all the copies of the Darkhold with her, leaving you trapped in her distorted spell,” Rio says. “But you don’t have to stay there, do you?” Rio asks as Agatha grabs at her neck, from her perspective she is removing a scarf she has around her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “It hot? Are you?” Agatha asks, as she pants, seemingly trying to claw at herself, clearly trying to get free.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, claw your way out,” Rio says, and she watches Agatha continue to claw at her skin, pulling off her clothes, trying to break through the spell she is under.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m feeling,” Agatha says, and she moves her hands in a way which Rio knows is her trying to use her magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “There are two Jane Does in this case, and you know her name. so, what’s yours?” Rio asks, and with her question, thanks to everything Rio and Nicky have already done, Agatha is able break through the last of the spell, clawing her way out, and resulting her collapsing so that her true self can finally come to the surface once more.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While sitting in a closet isn’t the most comfortable position Nicky stays where his mama put him, even though he could use magic to break free, as he knows that he needs to wait for his mama to ‘wake up’ again.
    </p>
<p>
     Being able to tell that his mom has once again left the house Nicky just continues to wait, and honestly, he isn’t sure how long has passed when he hears his mama scream and then a sound which tells him the front door has been opened.
    </p>
<p>
     Listening intensely to what is going on Nicky hears, a couple of minutes later, what he assumes his mama come back inside and run down to the basement. As soon as he hears his mama go down to the basement Nicky starts to make noises, in an attempt to remind his mama that he is there, as one thing that was never completely clear was just how much she would remember when they broke the spell. About a minute after Nicky started to make noise the door to the closet he is opens and Nicky sees his Mama, wearing only a robe and holding a wooden spoon like a weapon.
    </p>
<p>
     “So that arrest was maybe more of a kidnapping,” Agatha says as she sees him, clearly surprised. “But if you’re real, and not a figment of my imprisoned mind, then that means…” Agatha says, but before she can even get the question out the front door is blown to pieces, Agatha is sent flying across the room, and Nicky sees his mother fully dressed in what he knows to be one of ‘her job’ outfits, but with her face appearing ‘normal’ and not what she has never let Nicky see, as even when he died she took him to the vail as Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bit dramatic there, mom,” Nicky thinks to himself, though he isn’t overly surprised, as he watches his mother use a wall to catapult herself across the room and push his mama against the wall, putting a knife to her throat. “I really shouldn’t be watching this,” Nicky thinks to himself, feeling torn between feeling disturbed and like he is intruding on a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you,” Rio says to Agatha, with a chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you,” Agatha responds, and Nicky desperately hopes that’s not true as he wants his moms to be together again as he knows how much his mom still loves his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long has it been, Agatha?” Rio asks, not knowing that she has been close to ‘Agatha’ for three years because of the Sigil she cast.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not sure,” Agatha responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Since you acquired the Darkhold, you hid behind all that dark magic, but then you lost it, and now..” Rio says, clearly hurt, as she brings the knife closer to Agatha’s chest, cutting her. “Touch,” Rio says cutting Agatha’s chest.
    </p>
<p>
     From where he is watching what is going on between his moms Nicky seriously considers breaking the Sigil, putting an end to their fight, but he reluctantly decides to hold off for a little while as he knows his mom would be unimpressed if he broke the Sigil so soon, and he also remembers that his mother warned him that his moms fighting is how they say hello. So, he decides that he will only break the Sigil and intervene if it seems like one of his moms is actually going to seriously hurt the other.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re vulnerable,” Rio says to Agatha, and Nicky knows that is why the version of his mother who knows everything that is going on is so worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “Only physically,” Agatha says, and she grabs Rio and slams her head against the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Agatha slams Rio’s head against the wall the two of them continue to fight, lodging Rio’s knife in the wall, and Rio puts her hands around Agatha’s throat before kicking her across the room. After Agatha is kicked across the room Rio grabs her knife out of the wall and throws it at Agatha who uses a baking tray to block it.
    </p>
<p>
     As the knife slides across the room both Rio and Agatha rush for it, getting to it the same time, and Nicky hears his mama wince in pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you remember pain?” Rio asks as both Agatha and Rio continue to hold onto the knife, Rio holding the hilt while Agatha holds the blade, cutting her hand. “It kind of tickles, doesn’t it?” Rio asks, as they both laugh and after a few seconds Rio slices Agatha with the knife while Agatha hits Rio, causing her to be thrown backwards slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coochie, coochie coo,” Agatha says moving towards Rio and once again Agatha and Rio fight, Rio slicing her knife through the air, and after a few moments Rio is on her back, with Agatha on top of her, using one hand to hold down the arm that Rio has he knife in while her other hand is around Rio’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t kill me,” Rio reminds Agatha, and Nicky who very much wishes he wasn’t witnessing this, knows how true that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t kill me, it’s not allowed,” Agatha responds, and once she does Rio, in a single move, headbutts Agatha which causes her to both get to her feet and be pushed backwards, and while Agatha is getting her baring’s Rio uses her magic to get back on her feet, and then also uses the same magic to send Agatha flying across the room, causing her to crash a cabinet and crumple to the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe I can’t kil you, but I can make you wish you were dead,” Rio says, as she picks up her knife, and Nicky is just about to break the Sigil and intervene when his mama starts to speak before he can.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, wait, wait,” Agatha says, and Nicky is thrilled when he realises his mom is actually listening. “This isn’t what you want, me without power,” Agatha says as she gets to her knees. “This is undignified,” Agatha says. “Don’t you want me at my best?” Agatha asks getting to her feet. “Admit it, you prefer me…” Agatha starts to say in a seductive tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Horizontal?” Rio asks, completely disturbing Nicky, who is planning on making it clear to both his mothers just how much they disturbed him, once they know who he is. “In a grave?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Formidable,” Agatha corrects.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, take my power,” Rio suggests, even though everyone currently present at Agatha’s house knows that is not possible, and knows exactly why.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s cute,” Agatha says with a smile. “But you know that would kill me,” Agatha says. “Just let me get my purple back, and then come find me,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not the only one wants to see you dead,” Rio says, and while Nicky is surprised to hear his mom say that he notices her body language and he realises that this is Rio’s way of warning Agatha about who is coming after her, which is actually pretty smart. “Wants to see you burn. Or hang, or drown,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “There are no new options?” Agatha asks, and Nicky suspects that the words are actually getting to his Mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could just sit back and watch,” Rio says, and Nicky doubts that is true, while in a place deep down inside where Agatha would never admit too, she also wants to doubt it’s true.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, you love it,” Agatha says as she walks towards Rio, lowering her voice. “The Anticipation,” Agatha says once she is less than a step away from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay Agatha,” Rio says, putting her knife away in it’s sheath. “But I’ll be sure to tell them were to find you,” Rio says, reaching out and touching Agatha’s face, while Nicky knows that is not needed as only a few days ago Rio discovered that The Salem Seven were close to finding out where he and his mom were.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who specifically?” Agatha asks, trying to make It seem like she isn’t at all phased.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm! The worst of them. The Salem Seven,” Rio answers. “I expected you’ll see them at sundown,” Rio says, as she looks down at Agatha’s bleeding hand. “After all these centuries, Agatha Harkness will finally meet her end,” Rio says as she lifts Agatha’s hand a little. “Ugh! It really warms the heart,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have a heart,” Agatha snaps, as Rio moves closer into her personal space.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I do, it’s black and it beats for you,” Rio says before bringing Agatha’s hand to her mouth and once it is close enough, she licks the hand, using her healing abilities to heal the cut.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Rio heals the wound she walks away from Agatha and because Nicky can see his Mama’s face, he can see the effects that action had on his mama, which tells him that despite what she may say still has feeling for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te Veo,” Rio says before leaving, leaving Agatha flustered by everything and Nicky feeling both incredibly interested, and incredibly disturbed, by everything he just witnessed.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. Hope you like this chapter. That you so much for the response to the last chapter. Please let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For the few minutes that follow Rio leaving the house Agatha walks around, getting dressed and ranting, mainly about Rio, while Nicky makes his way out of the closet, knowing that, especially with the Salem Seven coming, he needs to talk to his mama about the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “The house is yours, random boy,” Agatha says, and because his mama doesn’t know who he is Nicky doesn’t take that personally. “Be sure to tell the vengeance-seekers I said hi,” Agatha says, and Nicky makes it seem like he is using the wall, but he actually uses his magic, to half pull the tape off his face, Nicky having learnt a long time ago how to subtly use his magic so he doesn’t get caught, and it isn’t until after he does it that he realises that it might not be the smartest thing to do around his mama, but to his relief it doesn’t seem like she realised what he did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take me to the Witches Road!” Nicky exclaims, knowing that it is what they both need.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come again?” Agatha asks, turning to look at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Witches Road, I want you to take me there,” Nicky says as his mama walks over to him. “Please,” Nicky adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Witches’ Road doesn’t exist,” Agatha tells Nicky, who has to resist the urge to roll his eyes, as he knows his mama is lying.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re lying,” Nicky responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Am I?” Agatha asks, giving her son a challenging look.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s just what real witches say to keep the amateurs out,” Nicky says. “The Road will give you the thing you want the most if you make it to the end, and I can, I will,” Nicky says, knowing that because he is the son of death herself and one of the most powerful witches in the universe, as well everything he has been through, including dying, there is nothing that can stop him from getting what he wants from the Road which for him is for his family to be back together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm,” Agatha says and for a moment she looks like she is considering what Nicky is saying. “The road is no place for a kid,” Agatha says, heading towards the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sixteen,” Nicky corrects, not overly surprised that Agatha is objecting to him going on the road because of his age because his mom warned that that may be the case, which means he has already thought of a possible way around that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, sorry, Teen,” Agatha corrects, and Nicky follows behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know where you heard about the Road….” Agatha starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Books, the ballad, legend, lore,” Nicky says before adding in his head. “My favourite bedtime story,”.
    </p>
<p>
     “But it will kill you,” Agatha tells Nicky, who has faith that it won’t because he knows he knows he can’t do that to his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “It didn’t kill you,” Nicky reminds his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m exceptional,” Agatha says, as she puts a black hat on.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s my point,” Nicky admits. “Look, cards on the table, I know an embarrassing amount about you,” Nicky tells his mother, only stretching the truth a little as he isn’t embarrassed about how much he knows about his mama because he always wants to know more. “I’ve been obsessed since I first heard about your Salem days, one of my favourite you eras,” Nicky says, once again fudging the truth a little, but also considering his mother’s Salem eras to be one of his favourite times to hear stories about because it’s when mothers met so he has always wanted to know more about that time in his mothers lives.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a good one,” Agatha says, trying not to think about Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s why I came here last night, why I saved you from the spell you were under,” Nicky says, trying to get his mama to be interested in him, without knowing who he is, so that he can get her to agree to go down the road, and, to his relief, his mama looks very interested at that. “No, it was my pleasure,” Nicky says as Agatha sits down Nicky feeling that after three years of trying, he is beyond thrilled that it worked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm, well... if you’ve got the goods to break the spell cast by the Scarlet Witch, why do you need the Road?” Agatha asks, gesturing to the couch for Nicky to sit down, which does, choosing his next words carefully because otherwise he risks, even with the Sigil in place, his mom realising who he is before agreeing to go down The Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, I’ve studied, don’t get me wrong, but that can only take you so far,” Nicky comments, knowing that how much studying he has done when it comes to magic is actually part of the reason why he is as powerful as he is. “I wanna blast, to shield, to levitate,” Nicky says, listing things he can already do because when his mother doesn’t know who he is, making it seem like they are both interested in power, is the best way to get her to agree to go down the Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you want a shortcut?” Agatha asks, clearly disapproving, which doesn’t surprise Nicky as he has heard his mom tell him, more than once, how much his mama values research and knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
     “The road promises that what’s missing awaits you at its end. Power is what I’m missing,” Nicky says to his mother, feeling bad about lying, but knowing it’s the best way to get her to agree to go down the road. “Sounds like it’s what you’re missing, too,” Nicky says, and for a moment it looks like he has convinced his mother, but she quickly changes her mind. .
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope. Too risky. No time,” Agatha says, standing up and heading to the door, so Nicky decides to follow her and try another tactic.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you wanna run, fine, but these people who are coming tonight sound serious,” Nicky says, knowing that is the most he can say about the Salem Seven without revealing that he knows exactly who they are, and exactly how dangerous they are. “You really think you can outrun them with no magic at all?” Nicky asks, trying to remind his mother just how dire the situation is, as he notices his mother pick up the locket that he knows has his hair within.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are you?” Agatha asks, and Nicky resists the urge to smirk, as this is exactly what he was hoping would happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky Vidal-Harkness,” Nicky says, and just like he was expecting the Sigil kicks in, and his mother doesn’t actually hear the words he says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Say again,” Agatha requests, walking towards Nicky, putting her locket into her bra, looking at him with a look of fascination on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m your son, Nicky,” Nicky says, and once again the words are distorted so that Agatha cannot hear what he says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Interesting,” Agatha comments, looking at him closely, and from the look on his mothers’ face Nicky can’t help but wonder just what she is actually seeing, can’t help but wonder if she suspects who he is yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Nicky asks, hoping that his mom was right and that the Sigil being triggered is enough to make her interested.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m driving,” Agatha tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Really? Yes!” Nicky says, feeling thrilled that worked and realising, even after so long, just how well his mom knows his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the next minute Agatha goes into the other room where she has what Nicky knows to be what, while under the spell, she imagined to be the car. After realising her mistake Agatha makes it seem like she was actually collecting a pair of scissors which she drops at Nicky’s feet before leaving.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though he knows it is risky, rather than using the scissors, as soon as his mother leaves the house Nicky uses his magic to break the ropes that are binding his hands and feet before chasing after his mama.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After leaving his mama’s house Nicky sees his mother a little way down the street, actually not to far from his house, and so he hurries to catch up with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha! Agatha!” Nicky says, as he chases after her, really hating that he can’t call her mama, something he has been wanting to do for three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you know about covens?” Agatha asks once Nicky catches up with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just that they are drawn together by mysterious forces of fate,” Nicky says, remembering what he read in his mamas old spellbook. “And that they are the truest form of sisterhood,” Nicky remembers. “Wait, do you have a coven?” Nicky asks, as he didn’t think so, but he also knows that because his mama and mom were apart for so long there could be things that he doesn’t know because Rio didn’t know to tell him.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, not for a very long time,” Agatha says, confirming what Nicky thought. “But we do need a coven to access The Road,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah, right, that makes sense,” Nicky says, not believing that he forgot that, and now he can’t help but wonder how he is going to make it so Rio is apart of the coven when, considering the fight they had, he can’t see his mama being fond of that idea and he is meant to have no idea who she is.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment his mother is silent as Nicky realises, she is staring at the plot where Wanda’s house once stood, something which tells Nicky she is still affected by what happened even if she is trying to hide it, something which doesn’t surprise him when he has felt what the spell feels like.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, I’m over here,” Nicky says, pointing to where his car is, feeling glad that he gave enough forethought to move the car out of the driveway as that would lead to awkward questions.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, are you?” Agatha asks, an edge to her voice, as Nicky leads Agatha over the car, quickly running through his head whether there is anything in the car that could hint towards who he is.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after they left Agatha’s house Nicky and Agatha are in Nicky’s car, which is technically Rio’s driving out of Westview. As they drive Nicky notices his mama is rather quiet as she looks out the window, and it takes pretty much everything he has not to talk to her, not to get to know the real her better, as that is all he has wanted for so long.
    </p>
<p>
     “Am I even going in the right direction…” Nicky starts to ask, doing so because he doesn’t want to sit in silent with his mama anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be cool, man,” Agatha says, and soon after she does Nicky’s phone starts to ring, and he sees Eddie on the screen with his boyfriend caller ID.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, he worries,” Nicky says, rejecting the call, knowing that that isn’t exactly how he wanted to tell his Mama that has a boyfriend, but now he has no choice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aw!” Agatha exclaims in an overdramatic tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, where do we just find a coven?” Nicky asks curious, as in all their planning his mom never made that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wherever you are, a coven there shall be,” Agatha quotes.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s beautiful,” Nicky says amazed, feeling that he is finally getting what he has wanted for a very long time, a witchcraft lesson from his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s definitely not,” Agatha says annoyed. “But it is the Covenstead rule,” Agatha explains. “Within any three-mile radius, there will be a collection of witchy-enough people to form a coven,” Agatha reveals, and Nicky finds that fascinating.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you actually jot that down for me?” Nicky asks curious as he pulls a small spellbook out of his pocket, a book his mother originally obtained for his mama but which she gave to him. “There’s a pen in the glove compartment,” Nicky explains to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, okay, of course,” Agatha says, and she opens the glove compartment, pulls out the pen, which she then throws out of the window. “Do you want me to take that?” Agatha asks, referring to the spell book Nicky is holding.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s…. I’ll remember it,” Nicky says, as he really doesn’t want his mother to throw his spell book out of the window too, but what he does want is to know more, so he decides to keep asking questions. “So, with a Covenstead, it’s unlikely we’ll find witches as high-profile as you,” Nicky says to his mother, through from what he knows he is pretty sure that there are very few, if no, witches who are as high profile as his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, there’s no such thing, Teen,” Agatha says, and Nicky is a little amused at what she has decided to call him because she can’t call him by his name. “But all we need is a bit of talent, even the most down and out witches when in close proximity with each other, bring out a magical spark,” Agatha explains, and once she does Nicky has to look away from his mother a this is the exact kind of thing, he has wanted his mama to teach him since his mother brought him back from the other side of the veil.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after Nicky and Agatha talked about members of a coven bringing out power in each other the two of them are walking into a psychic’s store, the first location Agatha wants to check for an actual witch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome to the curious,” An older woman greats Nicky and Agatha as they walk in, though considering how old Nicky knows his mother to be, he isn’t actually sure that she would be older than his mama even if their looks suggest otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good day Madam,” Agatha says, putting an over the top southern accent. “Oh, thank you so much for seein’ us. We are hopin for a miracle today,” Agatha says, continuing with the accent. “This is my boy, Beauford,” Agatha says and even though he knows that Agatha doesn’t know the significance it means everything to Nicky to hear her say that, and before he can say anything Agatha covers his mouth. “He doesn’t talk much. He’s got social anxiety,” Agatha says. “His Daddy recently passed, and we miss him somthin’ awful, and we surely would love to commune with him today,” Agatha says, and Nicky has to silently compliment his mother on her ability to pull a believable story out of nowhere. “But to be quite frank with you, what is top of mind is the location of some gold bars he may not have buried in our backyard,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please,” the woman, Lilia says, gesturing to the table, and both Nicky and Agatha sit down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you. You’re a doll,” Agatha says, and both she and Nicky sit down.
    </p>
<p>
     “How, will you be paying?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, he’s got it,” Agatha says, looking at Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Debit works,” Lilia says, and Nicky pulls a card he has to pay, purposely making sure Agatha doesn’t see the name of the card as he isn’t sure that the sigil will block that.
    </p>
<p>
     “He always takes care of mama,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Try to anyway,” Nicky thinks to himself, as that is the very thing he has been trying to do for the past three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your husband was a proud man,” Lilia says, and Nicky can admit that that does describe Rio, but he also has some doubts about what Lilia is going to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Indeed, he was,” Agatha confirms, clearly playing into what Lilia is ‘seeing’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did he golf?” Lilia asks and Agatha gives an over-the-top gasp. “He died on the eighteenth hole,” Agatha lies. “Oh, she’s good,” Agatha says, glancing at Nicky. “Now the location of the gold bars?” Agatha asks, and once she does Lilia makes over the top sounds which results in both Agatha and Nicky needing to resist the urge to laugh. “Brother,” Agatha mutters, and Nicky feels the urge to laugh get stronger.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll find the gold bars in an old bowling bag at the back of his closet,” Lilia lies.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, that’s it!” Agatha says, clearly becoming uninterested with Lilia. “Thank you, thank the lady would you Beauford,” Agatha says, standing up and turning away from Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s something else,” Lilia says, and Agatha turns back around to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it?” Agatha asks, giving her a challenging look.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been under the influence of another, someone you hurt,” Lilia says, and both Nicky and Agatha know exactly what that means. “They took your agency, for three years,” Lilia says, impressing both mother and son who realise she may just be legitimate. “It’s not the first time your witch kin betrayed you,” Lilia says, and even though his mom didn’t tell him much Nicky suspects Lilia is talking about what whatever it is that happened between his mama, Evanora and her original coven. “But you survive, in a way few do. In fact, that’s why you’re here,” Lilia says, saying enough to impress Agatha, as she stands up. “And I’m not interested,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously?” Nicky asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for your purchase. Your bank statement will say Lilia’s Leggings, but that’s just my side Hussle,” Lila says before heading into the back room and as his mother follows her Nicky does too, hoping Agatha has a better idea than him about how to get Lilia to join them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia, you haven’t even heard the pitch,” Agatha says as she and Nicky follow Lilia into the backroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t need to,” Lilia says with a laugh. “What witch in her right mind would join Agatha Harkness’ coven?” Lilia asks, and Nicky feels a rush of protectiveness towards his mama, but before he can say anything Agatha is speaking again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not looking for right-minded witches, as it happens,” Agatha says, and Nicky realises that either Lilia’s words don’t get to his mama or she is trying to hide the fact that they did, and suddenly Lilia screams.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you all right, ma’am?” Nicky asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you’re a big of a kook. Every witch has their process,” Agatha notes. “You showed some real skill out there,” Agatha says as she sits down at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t read your fortune, I read your reputation,” Lilia informs Agatha. “Witches like you are the reason people think we poison apples and steal children, and eat babies,” Lilia says, and once she does Nicky sees his mama’s entire body language change, which tells him that he is about to see what his mom warned him about, his Mama putting on a persona to protect herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Babies are delicious,” Agatha responds, proving what Nicky was suspecting. “How old are you? 410? 415?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “How dare you!” Lilia objects.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I apologize, you don’t look a day under four hundred and fifty,” Agatha comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Years old?” Nicky asks, not overly surprised by that because his mom is literally as old as the universe and his mother is over three hundred and fifty years old, but it is still a little surprising to know there are other witches older than his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “You get what, maybe two suckers a day in here, and twenty bucks later, you’re sitting on a bad that’s also your wall,” Agatha says, pointing out the murphy bed that is in the corner. “Don’t you miss the glory days?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “When I was chased out of every village I passed through for accurately predicting tragedy?” Lilia asks, and while he doesn’t remember a lot about the world before he died Nicky can remember that, he remembers that he, his mama and mom had to move a lot to stay safe, he also remembers when they were ran out of a village. “No, I don’t. Beat it Harkness,” Lilia says, clearly not wanting to listen to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna walk The Road,” Agatha says, clearly trying to get her interested and Nicky is a little amused that his Mama is using the same technique he used to get his Mama interested.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Road is a death wish,” Lilia points out.
    </p>
<p>
     “I survived,” Agatha says, knowing the road once gave her what she wanted most, the ability to have children with Rio, and that she is hoping it will be able to give back to her what she has lost.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah? Where’s your power now?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Time to restock,” Agatha responds, like it’s not a big deal. “I need a Divination witch,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you honestly asking me to coven up with the single most infamous witch on this continent?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh please. Name a badded bitch in South America, or Europe,” Nicky says, feeling the need to defend his mother as he is pretty sure she is the most infamous witch in the world, not just the continent.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is this child?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m…” Nicky starts to say, but before he can say anything Agatha cuts him off.
    </p>
<p>
     “My pet,” Agatha finishes, trying to keep the sigil from being activated in front of someone she doesn’t know as she still isn’t sure what it means just yet. “This is my pet. Say hi, pet,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi,” Nicky says, resisting the urge to roll his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You expect me to risk my life, on the Witches’ Road, and if we’re successful…” Lilia starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “When,” Nicky corrects, having complete faith that they are going to succeed.
    </p>
<p>
     “If we’re successful, watch you turn around and steal my power?” Lilia asks, and Nicky tenses at that, as he knows enough about that particular ability of his mamas to know it’s a sensitive topic.
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing the question Agatha clears her throat and moves closer to Lilia, clearly about to share something she doesn’t want anyone else, including Nicky, to know, but thanks to what his mother told him Nicky suspects he knows exactly what Agatha is going to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Excuse me. So, little known… no don’t worry about it… it’s fine it’s just us,” Agatha says, trying to convince herself to share something incredibly private. “Little known fact about my ability… I can’t steal your magic unless you blast me with it,” Agatha reveals, and Lilia looks surprised by that. “So, if you show a little self-restraint, which let’s be honest, you’re gonna need to, all that power is yours to keep,” Agatha reveals, and she can tell that Lilia is a little more convinced, and because of that Agatha knows she has one more card left to play. “I found this on your door,” Agatha says, showing an eviction notice. “The path you’re currently on leads nowhere. Join me,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Us,” Nicky adds, moving so that he is standing right next to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “And return to your former clairvoyant glory,” Agatha says, trying to be as convincing as possible, as Lila takes the eviction notice.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you two stay any longer, I’m gonna have to start charging you again,” Lilia says, turning away and as she does the kettle starts whistling, the electricity starts crackling and Agatha, without even realising that it’s what she is doing, sticks her arm out, pushing Nicky back, trying to protect him from what is about to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is happening?” Nicky asks, feeling amazed when he realises what his mother is doing, having a suspicion about what is going on, but wanting to check to be sure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Witchcraft,” Agatha confirms with a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Three of pentacles,” Lilia says before handing Agatha back the eviction notices with names written on it. “There, a list of four names. Looks like you’ve got your coven. Leave me out of it,” Lilia requests, and as Agatha reads it, she realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re on here,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Lilia asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t say no to you,” Nicky says with a smirk, before pulling a card out of his pocket, a card where he already wrote down Agatha’s address as he figured they would need it. “Agatha’s address,” Nicky reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be there five pm, plenty of street parking,” Agatha says, as she and Nicky head outside.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was amazing,” Nicky says once they are outside, as even though he didn’t do much it meant everything to him to be able to work with his mama on something. “And we’ve got a team roster out of the deal, too,” Nicky says. “So, who’s next?” Nicky asks, and as he does a crow caws, causing both Nicky and Agatha to tense as they both know that the Salem Seven can turn into animals. “Agatha?” Nicky asks, realising that if that is a member of the Salem Seven then they have to move quickly, which means they both have to focus on what they are doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asks, turning to look at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s next on the list?” Nicky asks, and Agatha checks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ugh!” Agatha says frustrated, and as the two of them get in the car to drive to the next location Nicky is sure, because of the way his mother is acting, that the next member of the coven is someone she already knows, but he is equally sure that it’s not his mom.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. You gave such an incredible response to the last chapter. I hope you like the balance I am going to find over the next few chapters of being close to cannon but also having twists and differences that fit this universe.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Not long after Nicky and Agatha left Lilia’s they arrive at another store, and as they walk inside Nicky notices someone, he knows a little about as not only does she have a pretty famous cosmetic line, but she also makes videos, Jenifer Kale, talking with people who are clearly customers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! Where do you keep your jade eggs? I’m fresh out of marbles and my pelvic floors all over the place,” Agatha says, once again disturbing Nicky, but she doesn’t know that. “Actually, you gals wanna go splittists on one?” Agatha asks, looking between the customers. “Hmm? Anyone? Anyone? Sisterhood of the traveling Kegels?” Agatha asks, as the customers leave, just like Agatha was hoping they would. “No? No?” Agatha asks as the door opens and closes. “Hi Jen!” Agatha greats in an over the top voice, confirming to Nicky that she is someone his mother already knows.
    </p>
<p>
     “God, Agatha, I haven’t seen you since I made a pointed effort to never run into you again,” Jen says and Agatha gives an over the top laugh, not even phased.
    </p>
<p>
     “So good,” Agatha says sarcastically.
    </p>
<p>
     “How are you? Awful?” Jen asks, and Nicky decides that he already doesn’t like how she is talking to his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m assembling a coven. I need a potions guy,” Agatha says, taking off the sunglasses she is wearing. “We’re gonna walk the road,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re serious? It’s a dead end. Literally,” Jen tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on, Jen, I’m offering you the chance to finally lift the binding spell that has kept you magic-less for the last… what, century?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look amazing,” Nicky tells Jen, wanting to be apart of the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Jen says to Nicky, clearly confused about who he is. “What do you care about my magic?” Jen asks, giving Agatha a suspicious look, and as she does, she notices Agatha’s hands and realises something. “Oh! You lost the Darkhold, and now you’re powerless and exposed,” Jen says, looking positively joyful at that. “How far you’ve fallen, Witch Killer,” Jen says bitterly, making Nicky realise just how much he does not like this woman, as he doesn’t like anyone being cruel to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “At least I’m still a witch,” Agatha tells Jen, seemingly not phased by Jen’s words, but Nicky suspects she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like I care about that dusty, warty, snaggle-toothed community,” Jen says, and even Nicky can tell that she actually cares very much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you don’t fool me, you’d chew off your own acrylics to get back in the club,” Agatha says, and as Jen looks away from her at that Agatha decides she is done. “Ugh! I’m not gonna waste my breath, illuminating the obvious. Have fun healing the healthy,” Agatha says, heading to the door and rather than following his mother Nicky walks up to Jen, as there is something he wans to try.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi. I love your insta page, by the way, you totally minimized the size of my pours,” Nicky says to Jen, completely lying but wanting to get in her good books before he tries to be convincing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s this?” Jen asks, looking at Agatha. “Another child sacrifice?” Jen asks and even though she tries to hide it Agatha is hurt by the words and because no one talks to his mother like that Nicky knows that rather than just being convincing he is going to be cruel as just because no one can know who he is doesn’t mean he can’t defend his mama in his own way.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m really sorry about your recent legal troubles,” Nicky says and as soon as he says that Agatha walks over to him and puts her hand on his shoulder, looking at the article. “Fraudulent misrepresentation resulting in consumer injury,” Nicky says, reading from an article he has gotten up on his phone, knowing that he cannot let anyone see his phone background as his non lockscreen is the picture of him and Agatha that his mom took on his fourteenth birthday. “I personally would not consider superficial burns ‘injury’ but apparently some people need skin grafts,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Jen!” Agatha exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “I haven’t been convicted of anything,” Jen says in her defence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yet,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Historically we as a group don’t do well in courtrooms,” Agatha reminds Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “The charge has a surprisingly lenient penalty, just like, payouts, and maybe like, five years in prison, but eight hundred counts of it?” Nicky asks and Agatha gasps. “Starts to get a little life-y!” Nicky points out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, so you’re magically bound and you’re about to get literally bound?” Agatha asks, clearly enjoying that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “None of this pedestrian drama would be an issue for a powered-up witch,” Nicky comments, purposely rubbing salt in the wound because of what she said about his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “You think I haven’t tried anything to unbind, you freaky little miscreant?” Jen asks angrily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Agatha objects, though she can’t help but feel proud of how Nicky is being convincing.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve tried everything but the road,” Nicky says, not feeling at all phased for two reasons, the first he knows he can defend himself, and the second is that he truly believes, even without knowing who he is, that his mama would defend him. “If you value your freedom, join us here, tonight,” Nicky says, putting another card with Agatha’s address down on the counter, before leaving.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh! I’m gonna take a jade egg to go, you’ll know where to find it,” Agatha says to Jen before following Nicky out of the store, feeling impressed with how he handled Jen, not that she would admit that when she doesn’t know who he is.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Two down, two to go,” Nicky says as he and Agatha walk out of Jen’s store, Nicky hoping that one of the names on the list is his Mom, but having no idea how to get his Mama to willingly have her be apart of the coven.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just one, actually,” Agatha corrects, once more adding evidence to Nicky’s theory that his mom is on the list of names.
    </p>
<p>
     “You sure? I thought Lilia said we needed four names,” Nicky says, slightly stressing the ‘need’ because he wants his mama to accept that, despite her issues with his mom, that they need her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was more of a suggestion,” Agatha responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty sure it wasn’t, let’s see the list,” Nicky says and as he tries to take it his mother eats the piece of paper. “Very mature,” Nicky says amused, though he understands a little more about why his mothers would have once gotten along so well as his mom can be very immature too, an amusing trait for death herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Teen,” Agatha says as she starts to walk. “Wasting daylight,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says, following behind his mother. “I can’t believe you actually ate that,” Nicky says, feeling amused by his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ate what?” Agatha asks. “Now I’m actually hungry, I could use a corn dog,” Agatha comments, and the two of them head back to the car so that they can go to the Westview Mall where they are going to find the next witch who is meant to join their Coven.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Not long after Agatha ate the piece of paper, something which Nicky still can’t believe, he and Agatha are sitting across from each other in the food court of the Westview Mall, Agatha eating a corndog while Nicky is just thrilled to get to spend time with his mama when she knows who she really is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you see her?” Nicky asks his mama. “Do you know what she looks like?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a blood Witch,” Agatha answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ohhh a child of a witch,” Nicky says, knowing that term because that’s one of many things he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Agatha says, giving him an interested look as she realises Nicky knows more than she would expect, and he is obviously trying to not admit to that. “Her mom was a witch, and also a famous goddess of rock,” Agatha explains, and as she does Nicky realises exactly who his mother is talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lorna Wu? As in Lorna Wu and the Coral Shore?” Nicky asks amazed, and clearly impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take it easy,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “She wrote the most famous version of the Ballard, I loved that song,” Nicky admits, as considering he exists because of the Road he always felt connected to it. “I bid on a limited edition signed LP of the ballad, but I kept getting outbid, I was so disappointed,” Nicky admits, and as he does both, he and Agatha hear the sound of a rat squeak, both of whom realise what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s go,” Agatha says, and to Nicky’s annoyance his mother leaves her rubbish behind, so he cleans it up.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Not long after they talked about the ballad Nicky and Agatha are in Hot Topic looking for Lorna Wu’s daughter while Nicky is also taking the opportunity to look to see if there is anything he wants.
    </p>
<p>
     “You think we’re gonna find Lorna Wu’s daughter at the Westview Mall?” Nicky asks his Mama. “I feel like she’ll be somewhere cooler, like Brooklyn or a yacht,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rumour has it, Lorna Wu was lost to the Witches’ Road,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Nicky asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, ironic,” Agatha comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “More like Iconic,” Nicky corrects, as he picks up a pair of sunglasses.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know I have an aesthetic, but what are we doing here?” Nicky asks his mother curious, and she pretends to put something in his pocket.
    </p>
<p>
     “Run,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Run?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Run!” Agatha exclaims, and Nicky goes running, before he can run out of the store, he is tackled to the ground by the exact person Agatha wants to talk to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice Wu Gulliver?” Agatha asks, as she gets to Nicky’s side. “I’m Agatha Harkness, this is my familiar, Toto,” Agatha says. “We need a protection witch to join us on the Witches Road,” Agatha says. “What do you say?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Alice asks, clearly confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Gulliver!” The store security officer says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sir, this woman just assault my nephew!” Agatha exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you just tackle a teenager?” the security asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I saw them lift something,” Alice responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, he didn’t touch anything. Check his pockets,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Search me,” Nicky says, realising what his mother is doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “He didn’t do anything,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your old lieutenant convinced me to give you a shot, but you’ve been nothing but bad luck. You’re fired,” Security says to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the next couple of minutes Agatha helps Nicky to his feet and the two of them follow Alice out of the store.
    </p>
<p>
     “What divine intervention is this? You’re out of a job and we’re setting off for The Road today,” Agatha says as she and Nicky follow Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “People like you are dangerous,” Alice says, and Nicky knows that she has no idea how right that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agreed,” Agatha confirms, clearly feeling proud of that. “But the Road?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “The road isn’t real,” Alice responds. “You groupies don’t get it. it’s just a stupid song,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, forty million copies worldwide, beg to differ,” Nicky comments. “The Road is real, Agatha’s been there,” Nicky says, the pride he feels about that being clear in his voice, which Agatha notices, but isn’t sure what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “And back,” Agatha adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Road is a myth, it’s a con, a cult,” Alice comments, and once she does Agatha and Nicky hurry forward so they can block Alice’s way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but what if it isn’t?” Agatha asks. “What if you could finally answer the question that has been haunting you for most of your life? ‘what happened to Mommy?’” Agatha asks, Nicky feels sympathy at that as for five years he wondered what was gong on with Mama, and in response Alice just steps around them, walking past them.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a tough nut to smash,” Agatha comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Crack,” Nicky corrects. “I didn’t even get to give her your address,” Nicky says, disappointed.
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t need her, come on,” Agatha says, taping his shoulder, and encouraging him to follow her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little after they tried, and failed, to recruit Alice Nicky and Agatha are once again in Nicky’s car driving back to Agatha’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got about an hour until sunset,” Nicky notes. “Are you sure two witches are enough?” Nicky asks, trying to encourage his mama to reach out to his mom, but he knows that is going to be difficult when he can’t explicitly talk about Rio. “So, how exactly do we open the door to the road?” Nicky asks his mother, as that was something that his mom never told him. “Is it hard to do?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where are you from?” Agatha asks, giving Nicky a curious look, still trying to figure out who he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me? Originally? I mean…” Nicky starts to say, and then he can feel the Sigil kick in, so he knows his Mama won’t hear anything else he says. “I was born in England, which you know, and then Mom says that the three of us moved around a lot, I remember a lot of of that, the adventures we had, and then after I came back Mom and I moved around a lot trying to find you, nothing felt right, nothing felt like home, without you. Then we got to Westview and while I liked being closer to you it wasn’t the same because I knew you weren’t you, but now that you’re you again I really want all three of us to have a home together,” Nicky explains and as he does, he realises that his mama is starting to figure out the Sigil, while Agatha is just becoming more fascinated with who this teenager could be the more time that passes. “It’s nice to get to know each other a little bit more,” Nicky says, realising that Agatha would be able to hear that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Drive faster,” Agatha says, planning on paying more attention to Nicky so that she can figure out who he is, and as he has a lot of experience driving fast with his mom that’s exactly what Nicky does.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after the Sigil prevented him from telling his mother anything that could indicate who he is Nicky is back at Agatha’s house with her. While Agatha has gone to get changed Nicky, who knows his way around Agatha’s house pretty well because of the time he has spent there with ‘Agnes’, has created a banner welcoming the coven and also put some of the baked goods he made on a tray for the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be nervous,” Nicky says to his mama as she walks back into the house, having changed her outfit, after being outside, Nicky smiling slightly as he notices that his mama is wearing the locket that he knows contains his hair. “They’ll show, I know it,” Nicky says, trying to be hopefully as he is still tyring to figure out a way to get his mom to join them, but none of the ways he can think of seem like they are going to be successful. “Does this look cantered?” Nicky asks, referring to the banner he hung.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me see,” Agatha says, walking over to the banner. “Maybe if I just put it a little more to the…” Agatha starts to say before ripping it down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Nicky objects, as while he didn’t work hard on it he doesn’t want it to be ripped down.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, leave it up,” Jen says as she walks in. “It really elevates the space,” Jen says, clearly giving Agatha a hard time about how the house look, something which Nicky knows isn’t Agatha’s fault due to the spell. “Oh my god, am I the first to arrive?” Jen asks, looking less than happy.
    </p>
<p>
     “The rest will be here soon,” Nicky says, still holding out some hope that his mom will join them, but he doesn’t have a whole lot of that. “Please come in. right, Agatha,” Nicky says, still not the biggest fan of Jen after what she said to his mama, but trying to be polite.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t care, yeah, whatever she would like,” Agatha comments, with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I interest you in a pre-road appetizer?” Nicky asks, offering the tray of baked goods. “Everything looks fresh, but it may be a few days old,” Nicky says, knowing that that is the closest he can get to the truth, and as he says that he doesn’t notice the pondering look his mama is giving him as she has no idea how he could know that, just like several other things she has noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I ate before I came,” Jen comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t mind a lapsed expiration date,” Lilia says as she walks in, and takes one of the muffins. “High Priestess,” Lilia says to Jen in a fair off tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jennifer Kale, potions,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia Calderu, Divination,” Lilia says to Jen and as she does, she notices something. “You’re bound,” Lilia notes.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you need a chemical peel,” Jen responds, and Nicky realises that Jen isn’t just rude to his mama but seems to be rude to everyone, something which doesn’t make him feel much better.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is never gonna work,” Alice says as she walks into the house. “Your front door is missing,” Alice notes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice!” Nicky exclaims, looking glad to see her. “How did you…” Nicky starts to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m an ex-cop, that’s gonna be the answer to a lot of questions,” Alice reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, the gang’s all here. Let’s hit the Road,” Agatha says, heading towards the basement, and Nicky quickly searches his mind for a way to get his mom to them, and to the Road, without anyone dying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait. Where’s our Green Witch?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do we really need one of those?” Agatha asks, and Nicky is the only one who knows why she doesn’t want a green witch involved, but he cannot reveal that; which is starting to be extremely frustrating.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course we do,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Says who?” Agatha asks, as she really doesn’t want to deal with her estranged wife who she knows is the Green Witch who should be apart of the Coven.
    </p>
<p>
     “The ballad,” Jen answers. “Wake thy power, earthy and divine,” Jen reminds Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’ve heard it,” Agatha says, quickly searching her mind for a way around Rio joining them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Earth magic is arguably the most important skill set for an attempt of the road,” Jen comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Getting cold feet already, Jen?” Agatha asks, challenging her, and Nicky knows that this is an opening he has been waiting for.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, there was one more name on the Coven list, wasn’t there?” Nicky asks, looking at his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia’s handwriting is so bad…” Agatha starts to say, clearly not wanting to discuss it.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was the last name?” Nicky asks, looking at Lilia, even though he knows exactly who it is, because he hopes that if the rest of the Coven keep putting pressure on his mama she will get in contact with Rio and get her to join them, something which he is certain she can do.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t a name, it was a heart,” Lilia says, and Nicky knows that’s pretty fitting, even if his mama would deny that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “A heart?” Alice asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “A black heart,” Lilia says, both Agatha and Nicky knowing how much of a fitting description that is for Rio, not that either of them will admit that, before different reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because you used a black pen,” Agatha says, and then as she looks between the others, she realises that they aren’t going anywhere without a ‘green witch’ but there is no way she is going to get the person who Lilia actually met. “Oh! I know who it is. I’ll just go get her,” Agatha says before leaving, and while Nicky is hoping that she is going to get his mom he still has some doubts.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Does she think there will be a Green Witch down the street?” Jen asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’d be surprised,” Nicky says, knowing that technically The Green Witch does live down the street, but Agatha doesn’t know that, and considering the Sigil in place he is pretty sure that Rio herself won’t even realise that.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About five minutes later Agatha, to Nicky’s disappointment, has brough Sharon Davies along as the Green Witch and the entire coven, including Nicky, but not his mom who should be with them, are down in Agatha’s basements.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, can we conjure the road here? Or do we need to go to a specific location?” Nicky asks his mama curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can conjure it here,” Agatha assures him.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, um, are we doing laundry together?” Sharon asks, and Nicky does feel sympathetic towards her as he knows she has no idea what is actually going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you really think it’s a good idea to have her with us?” Nicky asks Agatha in a quiet voice. “That lady from earlier, the one you fought with, is actually the Green Witch we need, right?” Nicky asks, trying again to get his mother to get Rio, knowing that he is walking a dangerous line, but still needing to try.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have no idea who you’re talking about,” Agatha says, though she does make note of Nicky calling Rio ‘The Green Witch’ as that is a title of Rio’s and it seems like too much for a coincidence for Nicky to just randomly call her that, but she doesn’t have time to dwell on that right now. “Why don’t you head upstairs, and let us do our thing,” Agatha suggests, as she wants Nicky, not that she knows it’s him, to be out of the way, and safe, while they either open the road or she goats the others into attacking her so she can get her power back. “Close some windows while you’re at it, cause it feels a little drafty,” Agatha requests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay but you’ll let me know…” Nicky starts to say, desperately hoping his mama doesn’t plan to leave him behind while she goes down the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep. Yeah. Scoot, scoot,” Agatha says, and she encourages Nicky to head upstairs, while she and the others start to do what they need to do to open the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After leaving the others in the basement Nicky heads straight to the living area where he immediately spots Señor Scratchy, and so he walks over to him and picks him up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Señor, have you forgotten me to?” Nicky asks, but to his relief he is able to cuddle his rabbit without a problem. “You haven’t,” Nicky says, relieved as he feels a tear in his eyes, being thrilled that someone, even If it’s a rabbit, remembers who he is. “Things aren’t going to plan, Mama refused to get Mom and now an innocent woman is in danger,” Nicky admits, not worrying about what he is saying as he knows no one will hear his actual words, and having a horrible feeling about what is going to happen to Sharon, but he is trying to ignore it as he doesn’t want to know if it is actually his ‘death sensing’ ability telling him something, or just a bad feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     As he continues to cuddle with his pet Nicky heads noises, and suspecting that he unfortunately knows exactly who it is, he heads outside where he sees one robed person turn into seven and immediately, he knows who it is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Crap,” Nicky says hurrying back inside, as even though they are down the street Nicky can feel how strong their magic is, can feel how connected they are. “Go somewhere safe,” Nicky says to Señor Scratchy as he puts him back down on the ground, as soon as he is inside, and once his pet starts to hop away to safety Nicky uses his magic to move the couch in front of the broken door, figuring the risk of someone seeing his magic is worth it considering it’s the Salem Seven.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the front door is as blocked as possible Nicky hurries to the kitchen and uses his magic to lock the backdoor, and then moves into position to see as many of the ways into the house as possible while also having easy access to the stairs down to the basement as he knows that that is where he will have to go.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have high hopes that will hold them off,” Nicky mutters, and within only a few minutes that is proven to be true as the Salem Seven easily breach the house.
    </p>
<p>
     As he finds himself surrounded Nicky knows he could fight back, confirming who he is, and making everything his mom has done, everything she has sacrificed, for nothing, or he can run. Not wanting to let his mom down Nicky goes running into the basement.
    </p>
<p>
     “AGATHA!” Nicky yells. “AGATHA!” Nicky yells and he sees an open trap door. “Is that it? is that the road?” Nicky asks, desperately hoping it is. “Because we should, really, really go, like right now,” Nicky says, running past his mother, and the others, and down the stairs, as everyone hears the Salem seven approaching.
    </p>
<p>
     As they hear the Salem Seven approach everyone, even Sharon, hurry through the trapdoor, which Agatha closes behind them, and onto the road. Even though Agatha was the last one who through the trapdoor she takes the lead.
    </p>
<p>
     “I never doubted us for a second,” Agatha says, and as she looks back at him, Nicky can’t help but smile at her, before they all take off their shoes and start their walk down the road together.
    </p>

     Thank you so much for the support. I really hope you like this chapter. How I am addressing the first trial. Please let me know what you think. Next chapter will be up in about twelve hours.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “It’s exactly how I pictured it,” Nicky says, as he looks around the road with a look on amazement on his face, as he has spent so long imagining what the road looked like, and he can’t help but wonder if it looks the same as when his mothers walked it all those years ago to make it possible to have him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, it suits you,” Agatha says, smiling back at him, having realised that even if he isn’t officially apart of the Coven his presence is clearly influencing things, and she isn’t completely sure what that means yet, but she is going to figure it out.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t think it was real, did ya?” Lilia asks Alice, who is looking just as amazed as Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you did?” Alice asks surprised, as she spent so long refusing to believe the Road exists and now she is standing on.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what this is? This is kidnapping, and I think it’s high time we involve the local authorities,” Sharon says as she pulls her cell phone, while Nicky is glad, she hasn’t said anything about his presences as it tells him that the Sigil is working on her as well and she clearly doesn’t realise she has known him for three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we gonna ignore the fact that something chased us down here?” Jen asks, feeling that that should be a bigger concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “Chased Agatha,” Alice corrects.
    </p>
<p>
     “And me,” Nicky mutters, but no one hears, and the Sigil doesn’t activate as no one was close enough to hear him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, no cell service,” Sharon says, and that surprises no one.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, whatever chased Agatha down here, it’s our problem now,” Lilia comments, feeling that that is something important for them to all remember.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that because covens share blessings and burdens alike?” Nicky asks, looking back at her, as that is something he remembers reading once.
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone really needs to call this kid’s parents,” Jen comments, and Nicky tries not to laugh about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a hundred percent sure they’re not reachable,” Nicky says, as he knows one of his mothers is right next to him, while the other is likely doing her job, and neither know who he is right now, and as he says the words Agatha finds his choose of words very interesting, adding them to the mental list she is creating about things she has realised about the teenager.  “So, anyone know if the Road is going to stay night as a vibe or if it’s gonna change?” Nicky asks, trying to get the attention of him and his parents as he knows that with the Sigil in place questions about either of those things will lead nowhere good.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I am a member of the Westview Historical Society,” Sharon says, hurrying to catch up with Agatha. “All I would’ve expected to see down here were remnants of our failed public transit system,” Sharon reveals, clearly not understanding that they have gone to a completely new place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Helpful interjection, random woman with no obvious magical qualities,” Jen comments, and while Nicky knows she is right he is still annoyed by her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! She has a name it’s Mrs Hart,” Agatha says the same time Sharon says,
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, whoever she is, she has no business on The Road,” Jen says, being pretty sure that Nicky has no business either, but she would be completely wrong about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what I’m saying,” Sharon says, having no idea what is going on and why she is apart of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyone can be a witch enough training,” Nicky says, as he has read about that, but he also knows it’s an extremely difficult path to go down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which puts the rest of us in even more danger and we don’t even know what we’re up against,” Jen says annoyed, clearly blaming Agatha for everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tame your fears, that’s what we’re up against, our worst nightmares,” Lilia says, remembering the words of the Ballard.
    </p>
<p>
     “But in what form?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Trials,” Alice answers. “At least that’s what the song says. What are they like?” Alice asks, as everyone turns to Agatha, even Nicky, wanting to know what she is going to say about that as Nicky has only knows the little that his mom told him, and he is sure there is more to what the trials entail than what she told him, he has no doubt that she tried to protect him from the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Road will test us and our knowledge of the craft,” Agatha explains. “One trial for each skill,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do we pass them without any power?” Jen asks annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, there’s always analogue magic,” Nicky says, remembering what he read in the book his mother wrote. “You know, labour-intensive manual acts of magic,” Nicky says, thinking of lessons his mom gave him. “Witchcraft, emphasis on the craft,” Nicky says, like it should be obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Again, who are you?” Jen asks annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky Vidal-Harkness,” Nicky answers, triggering the Sigil as Jen is annoying him, and because of that no one heard him say his name.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’ll be someone’s put a Sigil on that boy,” Lilia says amazed, and being able to tell even though she can’t tell who exactly cast the Sigil that whoever did was incredibly powerful.
    </p>
<p>
     “A what?” Nicky asks, pretending to be confused, as he figures it is his best move, but he quickly realises that may have been a mistaken when he sees the suspicious look on his mama’s face as from her perspective Nicky has demonstrated a high level of understanding when it comes to Magic so she would expect him to know what a Sigil is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t look at me,” Agatha says with a scoff when everyone turns to look at her. “I didn’t put that clumsy glamour on him,” Agatha reveals. “Sigil’s are beneath me,” Agatha says and Nicky is a little amused by that, but doesn’t let it show.
    </p>
<p>
     “A sigil is a spell?” Nicky asks, playing into his fake confusion as now that he choose to go down that path he has to keep it up.
    </p>
<p>
     “A Sigil is a redaction spell that hides something,” Alice says. “In this case, you from witchfoke,” Alice comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “No just witchfoke,” Nicky thinks to himself as he knows the Sigil also works, thanks to the fact that his mother cast it, other powerful being as well as it appears, Sharon, but that could be because she is currently around so many witches, or because she is on the Road, Nicky isn’t exactly sure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Looks like Agatha brought a sparkly little mystery with her,” Jen comments, clearly giving Agatha a suspicious look.
    </p>
<p>
     “She was probably trying to keep him all to herself,” Lilia comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “That is a little insulting, I am a person you know,” Nicky says, showing a little more of the sass he inherited from Rio than he intended, but to his relief his mama doesn’t seem to have picked up on the similarities between him and his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look,” Agatha says, taking a step forward and pushing Nicky back, protecting him, even without knowing who he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have no idea what’s under that Sigil,” Agatha says, and while that is not strictly true as she has her suspicions, suspicions she can’t bring herself to hope she is right, at least not yet, so there is no way she is going to share those suspicions. “He could be something special,” Agatha says, and while everything she has seen, everything she has heard him say, indicates he is, she isn’t planning on sharing that with the rest of the coven. “Or he could be a pest that a cranky witch stashed under a rock, we can crack him open later,” Agatha says, hiding the fact that she is going to figure out who exactly Nicky is, hopefully sooner than later. “The real value lies at the end of the Road,” Agatha says, wanting to get the others attention of Nicky as she is feeling a need to protect him, even if she cannot admit that. “So, if you want to unbind,” Agatha says to Jen. “And you want to reverse your fortune,” Agatha says to Lilia. “And you want to find out what happened to mommy,” Agatha says to Alice. “And you…” Agatha starts to say to Sharon, but she is gone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, where is Mrs D…Hart?” Nicky asks, being close to calling her Mrs Davies as that is what he has known her as for the past three years, but he quickly realises that’s not something he is supposed to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean you take your eyes off her for two seconds…” Agatha says annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next couple of minutes everyone searches for Sharon until they finally find her off the road, being sucked into the mud, but with some difficulty the group manages to keep her from being sucked below, to her certain death.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is just a really, really horrible party,” Sharon comments, once she has been saved, seemingly no worse for ware even if she is covered in mud.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I thought that this was pretty obvious, but for the uninitiated, rule number one, do not step off The Road,” Agatha warns.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I stray not from the path,” Nicky says, remembering the words of the ballad.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, thank you Teen,” Agatha says. “So, if we just follow the instructions of the Ballad, we’ll be safe as kittens. Okay?” Agatha asks, looking between the members of the group, and considering what he feels when he is close to Sharon Nicky very much doubts that is going to be the case, but he knows he can’t reveal that, especially because he doesn’t even want to think about it, and the group once again start to walk again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I don’t know how you expect me to walk and walk and walk when there is no where to walk to,” Sharon comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look,” Jen says, and everyone suddenly sees a house a little way away, a house which is clearly where the Road is leading.
    </p>
<p>
     “Was that there before?” Alice asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should stop asking that question,” Agatha advises, as they all walk closer to the house, so that they can have a better look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now this is a house,” Jen says impressed, as it is an incredible looking house that has appeared.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right of your vision board,” Agatha says, assuming from Jen’s reaction that this is going to be her trial, but she isn’t going to voice that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe this is the end,” Sharon says.
    </p>
<p>
     “That would be such a bummer,” Nicky comments, still trying to ignore what he is feeling now that he is right next to Sharon, even though it is getting harder for him to do so, but he knows that as long as he doesn’t touch her, he can continue to believe he is not sensing what he thinks he is sensing. “Sorry,” Nicky adds when he sees the less than impressed looks on everyone’s faces, and together the group continue to walk to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “The phases on the moon,” Lilia notes when she sees what is on the door into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s full, the Water phase,” Nicky says, looking at his mama to see if he is right, and she nods. “So, what do we do?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we don’t wanna surprise anyone,” Sharon says before ringing the doorbell.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t we?” Agatha asks with an over the top grin and everyone walks into the house, Sharon doing so reluctantly.
    </p>
<p>
     The second the group walk into the house everything changes, and not only do they find themselves in an incredible beach house all of their clothing, and hairstyles, have changed to fit the aesthetics of what seems like rich people at a Hamptons weekend.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not exactly the stuff of nightmares,” Jen says, as she looks around the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “The road changes for the coven,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “It changes us, too,” Lilia says, realising that they have all been changed to fit the aesthetics.
    </p>
<p>
     “My amulets!” Alice exclaims, and Nicky notices his mama touch her locket, in a way which tells him she is reassuring herself that it is there, something which doesn’t surprise Nicky when he knows the significance.
    </p>
<p>
     “You still got em,” Lilia assures Alice, trying to be reassuring.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s giving ‘middle-aged second chance at love’ vibes and I’m here for it,” Nicky comments, walking forward as he has a bit of a look around, there being apart of him that’s trying to get away from Sharon and what he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely a sip-your tea-with-both-hands-kinda place,” Alice notes, as she, along with everyone else, starts to look around, trying to make sense of where they are.
    </p>
<p>
     “I look like one of my customers,” Jen comments as she looks in the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     “These don’t open,” Alice says, referring to the doors on the other side of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god! Bury me in that kitchen!” Sharon exclaims, and for the next minute or so everyone looks around until Nicky finds a note on the mantal piece.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s this?” Nicky asks, as everyone hurries towards him and his mama takes the note. “A wedding?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please god, not a baby shower,” Agatha requests, as that would hit a little too close to home, and Jen steals the note from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Witches Road cordially invites you to the first trial,” Jen reads. “It’s a riddle,” she says. “My age has value. I’m no fun alone. I mess with your mind. My tricks are well known,” Jen reads and once she does Sharon takes the note from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a gorgeous card stock,” Sharon reveals. “Double-sided, too,” Sharon says as she closely inspects it.
    </p>
<p>
     “What does it mean?” Nicky asks, looking between the others as riddles have never been his strong suite.
    </p>
<p>
     “That it’s really expensive,” Sharon explains, even though that is not actually what Nicky is asking.
    </p>
<p>
     “My age has value, no fun alone, I mess with your mind, my tricks are well known,” Alice repeats, trying to make sense of what it means.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like a witch,” Agatha speculates.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like you,” Jen responds and Agatha mimics her, in an over the top sound, which makes Nicky even more curious about the history between his mama and Jen, as there definitely is some kind of history between them, but he knows he can’t ask about that without making Agatha even more suspicious about who he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wine!” Sharon exclaims as she sees a bottle of wine, with glasses, on a nearby table.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it! ten points for Mrs Hart,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ten points for what now?” Sharon asks as she picks up the wine bottle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, we don’t know what’ll happen if we drink it,” Alice warns.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, we do, something terrible,” Agatha comments, knowing that. “But if we don’t follow these obvious breadcrumbs we can’t move forward and we won’t get to the big prize,” Agatha comments. “So, does anyone have a corkscrew?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a built-in bar,” Nicky says, knowing that because he noticed that earlier, and he hurries over to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I will help you,” Jen says, as she follows Nicky to the bar. “Hey, bit of advice,” Jen says as she gets to the bar, while Nicky searches.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Watch your back with Agatha,” Jen reveals, and while Nicky is able to roll his eyes, he feels the Sigil pushing back against most of the things he wants to say, but he is able to say;
    </p>
<p>
     “I know how people feel about her,” Nicky says, knowing that from not just what his mom has told him but research he was doing when he was trying to figure out how to break Wanda’s spell.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you know she traded her own child for the book of the damned?” Jen asks, like it is a casual fact, and Nicky immediately feels furious, knowing for a fact that it isn’t true as from what his mom has said over the years, he has been able to figure out that his mama obtained the book of the Damned after he died in an attempt to bring him back.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true,” Nicky says angrily, feeling his magic bubble below the surface, wanting to come out, feeling glad that the Sigil didn’t keep him from defending his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe not, but it is what people say,” Jen tells Nicky, not realising just how close she is to being blasted across the room by Nicky’s magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s just what people say, then why the hell are you repeating it without knowing the truth?” Nicky asks, and Jen clearly has no idea what to say to that. “Maybe you should think about how you feel when people are talking about your lawsuits without knowing the full story before you spread rumours about things you don’t actually know anything about,” Nicky tells Jen. “Look corkscrew,” Nicky says with an over the top grin, before picking it up and taking it over the others, leaving Jen to wonder why he is defending Agatha so much while Nicky knows that when his mom arrives, and he is sure she will, it may be a good idea to keep her away from Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here Agatha,” Nicky says, handing the corkscrew to her, and Agatha gives him a curious look, wondering what just happened between him and Jen as Jen looks like she has been knocked down a few pegs and Nicky isn’t doing a good job at hiding the anger he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Agatha asks Nicky in a quiet voice, having lot of questions.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Nicky responds, and even though Agatha doesn’t believe him it is clear that he doesn’t want to talk about whatever just happened so instead Agatha uses the corkscrew to open the wine and starts to pour it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ohh, healthy pour,” Agatha says as she purposely pours a large amount of the wine into her glass. “If you’re waiting for a charcuterie, I don’t think it’s coming,” Agatha advises, and Sharon drinks her entire glass of wine in one go.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have had a very hard day. Do not judge me,” Sharon says, as everyone else is looking at her, and once she does a timer with thirty minutes on it starts to beep, signifying the start of the trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, to harbingers of doom?” Agatha asks, raising her glass, tyring to seem relaxed.
    </p>
<p>
     “To the prize,” Lilia says, as everyone toasts, Nicky doing so without a glass.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here we go,” Agatha says, actually sounding nervous.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I have some?” Nicky asks, as he notices that no glass has been poured for him, and it would be far from the first time he has had alcohol.
    </p>
<p>
     “You bet,” Agatha says, not seeing the big deal, but everyone else objects, making it perfectly clear that he isn’t going to get any of the wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Should we take the girl talk to the sofa?” Sharon, who now has a second glass of the wine says, and everyone heads over to the living area, all feel apprehensive about what is going to come, while Nicky has a feeling, that he knows at least one thing that is a certainty to happen.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I am extremely nervous for you to read the end of this chapter, so hope you like what I’ve decided to do. Next chapter will be up in about twelve hours.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As everyone heads over to the couches Nicky purposely sits down next to Alice for several reasons, one, he doesn’t want to deal with Jen anymore. Two, he doesn’t want to feel what he is feeling when he is in close proximity with Sharon as he knows what it means, even though he is still trying to ignore it. And the third reason is that ever instinct of his is telling him to run to his Mama, who is inspecting the windows, hug her and ask her why she lets people believe the worst in her, but as he cannot do that he sits next to Alice, figuring she is the ‘safe option,’, even though he is seriously tempted to break the Sigil so he can truly give Jen a piece of his mind and assure his mama that he doesn’t think she is the monster she clearly wants people to believe she is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Nicky says to Alice, figuring that he might as well make an effort if he is going to sit with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Alice responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really like your tattoo. Where’d you get it?” Nicky asks, trying to make an effort.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nowhere,” Alice snaps, clearly not wanting to talk about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says, understanding her desire, and he glances over to his mama who is still inspecting the glass doors, and not long after he turns away she pours out her glass of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Got it in Colorado,” Alice says, feeling bad about snapping at Nicky. “My mom was playing Red Rocks,” Alice explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “That symbols wards off curses, right?” Nicky asks, as he remembers seeing it before, probably in one of his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “She uh, made me get it,” Alice reveals. “Cause she said all the woman in our family were cursed… she wasn’t well,” Alice explains, trying to explain her mothers behaviour even though she doesn’t completely understand it.
    </p>
<p>
     “How old were you?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thirteen maybe,” Alice answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “A lot happened to me at thirteen too,” Nicky says, as that’s when he found his mama again, and she had no idea who he was.
    </p>
<p>
     “I miss your eyeliner, but the hair is cute,” Alice says, and at her kindness Nicky feels some of the anger he is feeling towards Jen slip away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so a witch is really just another name for a bad guy,” Sharon says as Agatha lies on the back of the couch behind her.  “Is that right?” Sharon asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “That is extremely reductive,” Lilia says annoyed. “We are not a monolith. And, you know, I blame Halloween,” Lilia says irritated, and considering he has seen how his mother, actual death, reacts to Halloween Nicky isn’t surprised about how Lilia’s feels. “Do you see any pointy hats in here?” Lilia asks and a few people around the room chuckle. “Any green skin? Any brooms? No sir,” Lila says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m not saying that I wanna join the club or anything, but I would drink the blood of a virgin if it would smooth out some of these wrinkles,” Sharon says as she stands up and as the others notice her face Alice gasps.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you are so sweet,” Sharon says, not realising the real reason why Alice just gasped. “I don’t really think I need it, either,” Sharon admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so, Mrs Hart,” Alice says in a gentle voice as she stand sup.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon,” Sharon corrects.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon, you’re a little swollen,” Alice says gently.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it bad?” Sharon asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think she looks fantastic,” Agatha comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve been poisoned,” Jen realises, also standing up.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Lilia asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need a mirror,” Jen says, as everyone starts to freak out, and searches the room they are in for ways to see how bad the poison is affecting each of those who have drunk it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does my face look that bad?” Alice asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me see,” Lilia request.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, my god, I have jowls!” Alice exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “My face!” Jen gasps. “My formally perfect face!” Jen exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly, I don’t hate it,” Lilia admits, using a tray to see her reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god. Is that what I look like?” Sharon asks, taking notice of the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Alice confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mrs Hart,” Jen says to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s Sharon,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sharon, you are so pretty,” Jen tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,”
    </p>
<p>
     “But since you were the first to drink, you’re our canary in a coal mine,” Jen advises.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Sharon says, and she goes to take another drink but Nicky quickly, without even thinking about it, reaches out and stops her. The second Nicky touches Sharon what he has been sensing is confirmed, and he knows that she is going to die soon, and there is nothing that can be done to change that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s poisoned Sharon, remember,” Nicky says to her, his voice stuttering, taking the glass, even though he knows her fate is sealed, but considering he isn’t sensing anything about anyone else he has to assume that not everyone dies.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you just let her drink it all,” Agatha says, causing everyone to look at her, which gives Nicky a few seconds to pull himself together, as he knows there is no point telling anyone what he can tell about Sharon’s fate as there is nothing that can change it, but considering he isn’t feeling anything from anyone else he suspects they still have a chance to complete the trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, it serves our best interest is all,” Agatha says, using her hair to hide the fact that she hasn’t drunk the wine, and therefore isn’t experiencing symptoms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’m gonna ask you a few questions so we can try to identity the toxin, okay?” Jen asks, turning to look at Sharon. “Do you feel a tingling in the back of your throat?” Jen asks, and as she asks her questions Agatha searches for another way out.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you taste mulberries?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do mulberries taste like?” Sharon asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you hear any ringing or the sound of fairies crying?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?” Sharon asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you guys,” Lilia suddenly says, to everyone’s confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel a little better,” Sharon says as her face returns to normal.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your face is back to normal,” Alice reveals, and everyone is glad to hear that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It went away so fast,” Nicky notes, assuming that’s a bad thing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yay,” Sharon says, as everyone else looks glad that the face swelling has gone away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yay, very much not yay,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Nicky asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “The fact that the face swelling decreased so quickly means it could only be one type of poison, Alewife’s revenge,” Jen reveals. “Face swelling is just the beginning,” Jen explains. “Next is dizziness, delirium, loss of motor function,” Jen explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “My hearts racing,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s another one,” Jen says. “Also, hallucinations, and eventually… Death,” Jen says, looking at Agatha, and just like his mama the second Jen mentions death Nicky doesn’t think about the concept of death he thinks of his mom, the personification of death, and while he wants to see her Agatha really doesn’t right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you spell, Alewife?” Nicky asks, wanting to write that down, as he wants to understand as much as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “I gotta get out of here,” Agatha says, running to the doors and trying to use a candlestick to break open the windows. Something which is not working. While everyone else is just confused by her behaviour Nicky is surprised because he realises that his mama would be acting the way she is because she doesn’t want to see Rio when she comes to collect anyone who dies.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?” Lilia asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop!” Alice exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “It will break,” Nicky says as everyone tries to stop Agatha who is solely thinking about how much she doesn’t want to see her estranged wife right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “She can’t keep doing it,” Alice exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s gone crazy,” Sharon says.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t run from the poison,” Jen tells Agatha, and as she does Nicky realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha didn’t drink the poison,” Nicky says, picking up his mama’s full glass and carrying it over to the others.  “You can’t cheat, Agatha,” Nicky says, though considering everything his mom told him he would imagine Agatha is seeing this more as doing what she has to do to survive rather than cheating.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? Who says?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “The road,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s ridiculous! We don’t all have to suffer,” Agatha argues. “Teen didn’t drink,” Agatha points out, giving Nicky an idea of just what he may have to try.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s not in the oven. And he’s underage!” Jen exclaims, and considering when he was actually born Nicky can’t help but wonder if that is actually technically true.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna shove it down your gullet, so help me…” Lila says, and Agatha takes the glass from Nicky and smashes it.
    </p>
<p>
     “No!”
    </p>
<p>
     “On the upholstery?” Sharon asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re wasting time!” Jen argues.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to drink Agatha,” Alice tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I would, but there is no more wine, so…” Agatha starts to say, and Alice picks up one of the empty glasses and as she holds it, it fills up with wine. “So cute,” Agatha says, moving backwards from the glass.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, if you won’t drink it I will,” Nicky says, moving towards Alice, having complete faith that even without actually knowing who he is, his mother will never let him drink poison.
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Agatha exclaims, knowing she cannot let Nicky, even if she doesn’t know he is Nicky, drink poison, and she pushes Nicky back and takes the glass from Alice, which she drinks in one go. “Augh, it’s so cheap,” Agatha says, pulling a face as she finishes the wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, please, Wanda? Wanda, I’m begging you. Let him breathe, please,” Sharon begs, and as she does Nicky notices the almost disturbed look on his mamas face.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, those hallucinations seem chill,” Nicky comments, feeling worried about what is going to do to everyone, especially his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, potions witch,” Agatha says, as he face swells too. “it’s time to brew an Antidote,” Agatha says, looking at Jen.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Over the next little while, while Jen is getting everything ready in the kitchen, everyone else, with the exception of Sharon who is unconscious, is searching for the other ingredients that Jen needs to complete the potion. Having been partnered with Alice, who just had a hallucination, Nicky is with her heading back to the kitchen, and when they to the main area of the house they find Jen, who from the look of her, clearly just had a hallucination too.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Alice asks Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, are you?” Jen asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely not,” Alice admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “We got the frankincense,” Nicky reveals, trying to get everyone to focus on the potion as he knows that that is what they need to focus on right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you check the pantry for the gut of a eusocial insect?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Jen confirms, and as she does Nicky realises what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s just a gross term for honey, isn’t it?” Nicky asks, as that is what he assumes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Alice confirms as Jen and Agatha, both having their arms full of Jen’s Kale Care products, walk into the main area of the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, we’ve got ours, what’s next?” Agatha asks, and as she does the group hears the sound of glass creaking steadily. “What is that?” Agatha asks, and the group walk over to the windows Agatha was banging on earlier and sees that water is starting to come through.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that…?” Lilia starts to ask, as Jen licks the water that has come through the cracks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Salt water,” Jen confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we underwater right now?” Nicky asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long is that gonna hold?” Alice asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what happens when it breaks?” Nicky asks worried, looking at his mama for the answers, and he notices she actually looks afraid.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, thank you,” Agatha says, and everyone heads into the kitchen, laying Sharon on the table when they get there, only Nicky knowing that here is no hope for Sharon, but there is for everyone else, and it is only the knowledge that not everyone’s fate is sealed that keeps Nicky from completely falling apart.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Sharon is lying on the table everyone else, carrying the ingredients they collected, hurry over to the sink where Jen is brewing the potion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, the elements need to be added in a certain order, in a specific time, starting with gut and eye,” Jen instructs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Alice says and she adds that. “All right, next is… frankincense,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no, wait. Get out of here,” Jen says, before Alice can add the wrong ingredient. “Where’s the zooplankton?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ohh,” Agatha says, showing the bottles of Jen’s own skin care products that they collected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “All natural or not, Jen?” Agatha asks, clearly challenging her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Drop it in,” Jen says with a sign.
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it,” Agatha says, feeling rather smug about that, as she and Lilia add everything they have collected into the potion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now, frankincense now?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Obliviously. Yes, three drops,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Alice says, and she tries to get the bottle open, but she struggles due to the effects of the poison.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take your time,” Jen says annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me help,” Nicky says, taking the bottle from Alice, and as he does his hand brushes her and he feels nothing which tells him she is a certainty to die soon, which makes him feel a little better. “One, two, three,” Nicky says, as he adds each of the drops into the potion.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s working, it’s working right?” Agatha asks as the potion changes colour.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh,” Jen says as she stares at the potion.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? What’s wrong?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Any bright ideas on how to set this sink to boil?” Jen asks, realising that she should have thought of this sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t think of this before?” Agatha asks annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “In the middle of a traumatic hallucination. No, Agatha, I did not!” Jen exclaims, and as she does Nicky gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there a sous vide?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh brilliant,” Jen says, as Lilia and Agatha look confused, and Nicky quickly hurries to search for one.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s something people know about?” Agatha asks, looking at Lila, who looks just as confused, having no idea what that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a super fancy cooking tool,” Nicky explains, finding it and hurrying back over to the seat with it. “It heats water to a specific temperature, so that you can cook your meat easily,” Nicky says as he puts it in the water and plugs it in. “I love using mine,” Nicky reveals, as his mom got him one a few months back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah cute,” Agatha says to him, though she files ‘loves to cook’ away on the list she is keeping about him.
    </p>
<p>
     “TEEN!” Jen yells as she can’t pick up a wooden spoon so Nicky quicky gets it for her, before hurrying back to the sink.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need you to stir with your dominant hand, counterclockwise,” Jen instructs, and Nicky quickly starts to do that without a problem. “Everyone, pull a strand of hair outta your head now,” Jen tells everyone and as she starts to give instructs Agatha suddenly sees a bassinet appears and a baby crying.
    </p>
<p>
     Hurrying over to the bassinet Agatha quickly moves the blanket and to her absolute horror she doesn’t see her baby, her little boy, she sees the Darkhold, and she moves back in horror and devastation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Jen says, trying to snap her back to reality.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you see?” Nicky asks his mama concerned, suspecting that what she saw has to do with him, or if not him then his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing,” Agatha says, even though she is so far from okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, we need your hair,” Jen tells Agatha, and she, despite still feeling haunted by what she just saw, gets back to her feet, pulls her hair and gets to the sink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, wait, now,” Jen says and once she does Jen, Agatha, Alice and Lilia all drop their hair into the potion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop stirring,” Jen tells Nicky who does just that. “We need to clasp hands,” Jen says, and everyone does that. As Nicky claps hands with both Lilia and Jen Nicky feels nothing that tells them they are going to die soon which means the only person he hasn’t confirmed is going to be okay, as touch is the only way for him to be completely certain, is the one person he wants to know about most, his mama. “And clear your minds. Once are intensions are aligned, it will glow bright cerulean,” Jen reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are our intentions again?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “To not die,” Jen tells her in an annoyed tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get cerulean and chartreuse confused. Is cerulean the green one?” Alice, who has opened her eyes, asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s blue,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then it’s not workin,” Alice reveals, causing the others to open their eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s like a blue green, maybe like a teal?” Nicky suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s green, Teen,” Lilia tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something is wrong. I must have forgotten something,” Jen says, becoming upset.
    </p>
<p>
     “One minute left,” Alice, who is looking at the timer, says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you forget?” Agatha asks Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know!” Jen exclaims. “I’ve never made this potion before! I make retinol serums, for Christ sake!” Jen exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fifty seconds,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “There was a time where I would be able to just solve this with a wave of my hand, but now?” Jen asks, becoming upset. “I’m bound. He stole my magic!” Jen exclaims, becoming even more upset. “We’re all going to die here,” Jen says, moving back from everyone. “I don’t want to die here,” Jen says, and before Nicky can test to see if the Sigil will let him assure Jen that she isn’t going to die during this trial, his Mama beats him to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have always hated you,” Agatha says as she puts both her hands on Jen’s shoulders, trying to get her to focus.
    </p>
<p>
     “If this is a pep talk…” Jen starts to say, having no idea what Agatha is doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I left you alone because what you were doing is important,” Agatha tells Jen. “Not this Kale Care crap, the real work,” Agatha says, as she knows how incredible the way Jen helps women, especially pregnant women, is. “You can be that witch again,” Agatha says to Jen, that being the nicest thing Agatha has ever said to her. “They can take your power, Jen, but they can’t take your knowledge,” Agatha says, as she always feels that knowledge is incredibly important. “Jen?” Agatha asks, needing her to have the answer already.
    </p>
<p>
     “Blood,” Jen suddenly says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whose and how much?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need the blood of the poisoned,” Jen reveals, and while he knows that means him Nicky is a little worried that his blood, considering who he is the son off, won’t have the desired effect, but he can’t raise his concerns due to the sigil.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thirty seconds,” Alice says as Agatha grabs the knife.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for being underage,” Agatha says before cutting Nicky’s hand, and as she does that Nicky uses the opportunity to touch her hand, without Agatha realising, and as he does, he is reassured when he doesn’t experience the sensation that tells him she is going to die with no possible way of surviving, because it means his mama is going to survive, this trial at least.
    </p>
<p>
     After Nicky’s blood drops into the potion, it takes a few second before it changes colour and Agatha, Alice, Jen and Lila all drink, all of them immediately feeling the antidote working.
    </p>
<p>
     “The timer’s still ticking!” Jen exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mrs Hart,” Nicky says, even though he knows it will be no use, and the group passes the antidote between them until it is poured into her mouth, and at the exact same second the potion is poured into her mouth the timer stops and the oven, clearly their exit, opens.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that our exit?” Alice asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am not climbing in an oven,” Lilia objects. “That happened to a friend of mine, she had a lovely house, and she ended up…” Lilia starts to say but before she can give more of a explanation everyone screams as water bursts into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Move it,” Jen says, and she pushes everyone else out of the way to exit through the oven, and after Jen exits Llia does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Help me with her!” Alice says, referring to Sharon.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a chance,” Agatha argues.
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t know what happens if we leave her behind,” Nicky says as while he can tell Sharon is certainly going to die, he can tell that she hasn’t died yet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine!” Agatha says with a scoff, and with something difficulty she, Nicky, and Alice manage to get her through the oven, and after they do Nicky goes next.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as he is through the exit Nicky goes straight to Sharon, who he knows is barely hanging on.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Nicky says reassuringly to Sharon, his voice too quiet for anyone else to hear. “You’re going to see someone familiar really soon and she’s going to take you to where you need to go,” Nicky tells Sharon, though with the Sigil he isn’t even sure if Sharon will recognize Rio, even after her death.  “You don’t have to be afraid, it will be okay,” Nicky assures Sharon, taking her hand, wanting to give her some comfort in her last moments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ouch…” Sharon says, moaning, clearly in pain and as he takes her hand Nicky can feel that she is going to experiencing a few minutes of incredibly pain before dying, and there is nothing he can do to change her ultimate fate, but what he can do is take away the pain she is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay. You’ll be okay, you’ll be in a better place, trust me, I’ve been there, it’s okay,” Nicky says, and he does something incredibly painful, he uses a small amount of his magic to end her suffering by squeezing her lungs so she can’t breathe, ending her life in seconds rather than the several painful minutes she was going to experience. “I’m sorry,” Nicky says, feeling extremely guilty, but also feeling like he did the right thing because he knows there was nothing that would have saved her.
    </p>
<p>
     Having no idea what Nicky just did, Agatha is pushing everyone else out of the way as she walks down the ‘slide’ they just used to come out of the trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “A little rusty there, Jen?” Agatha asks her.
    </p>
<p>
     “A little traitorous there, Agatha?” Jen responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop,” Lilia tells them, knowing that the last thing they need right now is for Agatha and Jen to start fighting again. “We’re alive. We made it through the first test. Everyone is safe,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nott everyone,” Nicky says. “Sharon’s dead,” Nicky reveals, closing her eyes, and hoping that she is already with his mom on her way to where she needs to go a place where she won’t be in the pain she was just in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Sharon?” Agatha asks.
    </p>

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     This is a shorter chapter, but the next ones will more than make up for it. I promise. Because of that (and the fact that I have the next two days off work) I will update the next chapter a little sooner in like 9ish hours. Thank you so much for the incredible response to the last chapter. It means so much to me.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Moments after Nicky tells everyone that Sharon is dead, he gets started on digging her grave as he feels that because he sped up her death, even if it was for the right reasons, the least he can do is make sure she is laid to rest properly.
    </p>
<p>
     As he digs the grave Nicky, who is doing his best not to think about what he did as while he feels like it was the right thing he still feels guilty, notices his mama inspecting Sharon’s body and he really hopes she hasn’t realised what he did, as he doesn’t want to let her down. Unknown to Nicky Agatha has realised that Sharon was killed by magic even if she doesn’t know the full story.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t think you had it in you,” Agatha says, suspecting she knows exactly who aided Sharon in her demise, even though she can’t tell for sure, and she knows that if she is right then it is certainly a surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t think who had what in them?” Nicky asks his mama, hoping she hasn’t realised what he did as there is no way for him to explain why he did it when the Sigil is in place, and he really wants to explain himself. Hearing Nicky’s question Agatha just winks at him, making it clear that she isn’t going to tell anyone what she has realised, and allowing Nicky to believe, just for a moment, that she won’t be disappointed in him once the Sigil is broken.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next few minutes Nicky continues to dig Sharons’ grave, getting some help from Alice, who doesn’t want to talk to Jen and Lila anymore, while Lilia and Jen sit down on rocks, and Agatha, who has taken her hair down, uses a tree to stretch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, RIP, Mrs Hart,” Agatha suddenly says, causing everyone but Nicky to look at her. “Well, shall we?” Agatha asks, wanting to get going before Rio turns up, as Agatha is sure she will, but to her annoyance nobody makes an effort to move. “Okay, so what’s the problem now?” Agatha asks, looking between the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “A woman is dead, Agatha,” Lilia says, in a ‘why do I have to point out the obvious’ tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, and Alice and Teen are kindly digging a grave for her,” Agatha says, pointing to where Nicky and Agatha are almost finished burying Mrs Hart. “So, they’ll catch up when they can Vamonos,” Agatha says, slipping into Spanish without even thinking about it, trying to avoid being around when Rio shows up to collect Mrs Hart, and she dramatic flares her coat, but once again no one follows her. “Okay, Mrs Hart was a bad draft pick, okay? Of course, the road killed her,” Agatha says, even though she almost positive Nicky played a part in Sharon’s death, she doesn’t plan on telling anyone that. “More power for the rest of us,” Agatha says, rubbing her hands in an excited way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Setting aside your staggering callousness,” Jen says, standing up. “We still have the issue of our incomplete Coven,” Jen points out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh. Okay. Yes. Okay, now I know the confusion,” Agatha says, understanding what Jen is thinking. “We needed the whole gang to access the Road, but after that it’s anybody’s game,” Agatha reveals. “It’s like the Ballard says, ‘Burn and brew with coven two, and glory shall be thine,” Agatha miss-quotes with a chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Ballard clearly says with cover TRUE, glory shall be thine,” Jen corrects, giving Agatha an annoyed look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does it?” Agatha asks with a laugh. “It’s coven two!” Agatha exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “That doesn’t make any sense,” Jen argues, the annoyance she is feeling towards Agatha being perfectly clear in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does if you’re a student of the Ballard,” Agatha responds, becoming even more annoyed by Jen like she constantly is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her mother recorded the most popular version of the ballad,” Lilia says, trying to put an end to the fight that is going on. “So maybe we ask Alice,” Lilia suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “How many witches left the Road with you last time?” Alice asks Agatha, as Nicky puts flowers down on Sharon’s grave, muttering another apology as he does, and Agatha puts up one finger as she the only person who left The Road with her last time was Rio, and she’s a lot more than a witch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, whatever,” Jen says with a shrug. “We still need a Green Witch. We would not have survived the last trial without my expertise,” Jen argues.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not all of us did,” Alice points out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, where were you when Mrs Hart needed protection?” Jen argues, and Agatha is clearly becoming amused with all the bickering, but she also keeps glancing over at Nicky who is staring at Sharon’s grave, not really noticing what the others are doing as he is still thinking about what he did.
    </p>
<p>
     “According to my count, Mrs Hart drank two glasses of the poisoned wine,” Lilia says. “How many doses of the antidote did she get, Potions witch?” Lilia asks. “This is our fault,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, wow,” Jen says, clearly insulted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ohh,” Agatha comments, becoming more interested, in the debate that is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s everyone’s fault!” Nicky says, as he stands up and walks over to them, knowing it was his fault her death happened sooner, but it was going to happen anyway and that is on everyone. “We were supposed to look out for each other, but we didn’t,” Nicky tells the others. “That was our fatal mistake,” Nicky says, remembering what his mom said about death coming easy on the Road, and realising that she was right, and he hates that he had to feel it coming for Sharon, knowing that there was nothing he could do, that he was completely powerless.
    </p>
<p>
     “Most fatal for Mrs Hart,” Agatha trying to lightly the mood a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel like we should go back,” Nicky says, looking upset, as while he knows he has to finish the road to save his family, he doesn’t want to experience knowing someone else he is with is going to die before they do again, something which he knows will be hard to ignore if they continue to be so close to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t,” Alice tells him in a gentle voice. “We can’t go back, and we shouldn’t go forward. Not without a replacement Green Witch,” Alice comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “People can’t be replaced,” Nicky says, and as he does Agatha gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t they?” Agatha asks, knowing what they can do, and having a sinking suspicion that she knows exactly who it will summon, but she just hopes she is wrong and because of that she is trying hard not to think about her suspicion. “What if we summon a backup green witch?” Agatha asks, and like his mama Nicky suspects he knows exactly who will be called, but unlike his mama he hopes his suspicion is correct as even if she doesn’t know who he is he really, really, wants to see her again, especially considering what he just did.
    </p>
<p>
     “To the Road?” Jen asks shocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is so much that can go wrong,” Alice says horrified, feeling that there is no way this could end well.
    </p>
<p>
     “So much has already gone wrong,” Agatha points out, and Nicky agrees with her about that. “I mean, aren’t we already coven-less witches, and by extension, rule breakers, right?” Agatha asks, looking between Lilia, Jen and Alice as they are the ones who she has to convince.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess, we just have to be careful, and specific, but mostly careful,” Lilia comments, feeling that it could work.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, well said,” Agatha says approvingly, and she knows that now Lilia has agreed the others will, something which is confirmed when Alice nods and Jen shrugs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now, anyone have a spell book?” Lilia asks, and everyone turns to Nicky who nods and pulls his spell book out his pocket, being careful not to accidently pull his knife as he does, because he knows he can’t answer the questions that will cause if anyone, his mama especially, sees it, and once he has the book, he hands it to his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the next few minutes Agatha, Alice, Jen, and Lilia, mainly Agatha and Lilia who have clearly done something like this before, set up what they need for the spell, and as they do Nicky becomes pretty sure that it’s going to be his mom that they summon, and he can’t wait to see how his mama reacts to that.
    </p>
<p>
     Once everything is set up the group stands in a line, Nicky standing right next to his mama, Agatha starts to chant in Latin and wave her hand over the silhouette of a person that they have made out of dirt and leaves.
    </p>
<p>
     “May she be strong and wise, and the best at her craft,” Lilia says, as she puts a crystal down on the silhouette.
    </p>
<p>
     “May she be smart, and not annoying,” Agatha says as she puts a flower down on the silhouette. “And also, not super political,” Agatha adds before standing up.
    </p>
<p>
     “May she be pleasant looking,” Jen says, also putting her object down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can she bring some Advil?” Alice asks as she puts her object down, causing Lilia to scoff.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, okay,” Agatha says and once Alice puts down her object Agatha casts the rest of the incantation, hands Nicky back his spell book, and waves her hand three times, as the wind picks up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now what?” Nicky asks, looking at his mama for the answer, but it is not her who answers, it’s Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now we wait,” Lilia explains. “True witchcraft takes time. The spell must marinate, gestate,” Lilia advises, and as soon as she says the words there is the sound of someone crawling out of the grave, they made for Sharon causing everyone to scream and gasp as they turn to see what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what did you do?” Jen yells, as Agatha tries to push everyone back from, who Nicky knows to be, his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean, what did I do? This was clearly a group effort,” Agatha says, not understanding why she is getting blamed for something they all did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did we create a zombie? What spell did we cast?” Alice asks as she takes Nicky’s spell book and tries to search it to figure out what they just did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why is the print so small?” Lilia asks annoyed, as she cannot make out what is on the pages.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, are you okay?” Nicky asks, causing Agatha to be suspicious why he isn’t more freaked out, as while he knows it’s his mom she is clearly still adjusting to being on The Road and what had to happen to get her there. As it becomes clear who it is Nicky desperately wants to run to her, hug her, and confess what he did, but because he knows he can’t he looks at his mama to distract himself by seeing how she reacts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Heard you were having a party,” Rio says, in a very casual way, like she didn’t just craw out of a grave.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you…” Agatha says, looking at Rio with an annoyed look on her face, as while she suspected Rio would be the one who came she had hoped that her suspicion was wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was in the neighbourhood,” Rio says with a smirk, both Agatha and Nicky knowing exactly why that was, as she moves closer to Agatha. “Surprise, M’Lady,” Rio says, presenting Agatha with the same flower Agatha put down to cast the spell, and while Nicky is amused that her mom is flirting considering everything, Agatha looks furious and goes to attack her, but both Jen and Alice grab her arm, trying to keep her from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “We just summoned her,” Jen reminds Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What need her, what are you doing?” Alice asks confused, as Rio just grins, not at all phased by Agatha’s behaviour as she was expecting it.
    </p>
<p>
     Letting out an annoyed yell Agatha pulls herself free from the others and walks away. As he sees his mama walk away Nicky looks between his mama and mom and for a second, he debates what to do, but then he decides to follow his mama as he figures it will be the better option as his mom is likely just going to introduce herself to the others as her ‘The Green Witch’ identity, where his Mama doesn’t seem completely okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha wait!” Nicky calls after his Mama as he hurries to catch up with her, but she is walking surprisingly fast, which requires him to run fast until he finally catches up with her. “So, the dangerous-but charismatic lady is back,” Nicky says, it feeling very odd to describe his mother like that, but as he isn’t meant to know exactly who he is there is nothing else he can say, at least nothing that won’t trigger the Sigil, and he isn’t overly surprised when his mama groans in response to that. “Do you wanna talk about it?” Nicky asks, and he isn’t overly surprised when his mama ignores the question. “Are we in trouble, Agatha? Like more than we were ten minutes ago?” Nicky asks, and Agatha ignores that question too, so they just continue to walk.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha continues to walk with Nicky by her side, and the others catching up behind, she can’t help but think about Nicky’s question. Technically she knows the rest of the Coven aren’t in trouble, that Rio can’t hurt them or do anything to them, but she knows she is, because Rio has power over her that has nothing to do with her identity of Death or even The Green Witch; power that no one else has.
    </p>
<p>
     Whenever Agatha is around Rio, she remembers how much love she has for the eternal being, she remembers how Rio was the first being who made her feel safe, like she wasn’t evil, who made her feel like a woman, who made her feel like it was okay to feel period, and whenever she is around her, she remembers that, and the family they created out of that love. But, along with all the good things she remembers about Rio whenever they are near each other, she also remembers the bad. She remembers the pain, grief, anger, and betrayal she felt when Rio took their son, the very thing that led her to the Darkhold, to Wanda, to spending three years under another’s control, something she long ago swore she would never let happen again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Nicky says hesitantly, cutting through Agatha’s thoughts, and she looks at him. “If you do want to talk about it, I’m here,” Nicky tells his mama as they continue to walk, Agatha once again ignoring his statement, but she does find it extremely interesting that he said it.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For a little while the group continue to walk, Nicky being sure that Alice, Lilia, and Jen are both intrigued and terrified of his mom, something which he knows is a pretty standard reaction, while Rio herself is clearly having fun, and Agatha is doing her best to ignore Rio, not talking to anyone else in the process. As he is becoming rather uncomfortable with both his moms being so quiet, and he wants to help them, Nicky is desperately searching his mind for something to say when he notices something in the distance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here we go, again,” Nicky says, noticing the house they are walking towards.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pass,” Alice says, turning to walk in the other direction, clearly not wanting to go into the house as she has a feeling that it is going to be her trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “A mutiny already?” Rio asks Agatha, with an amused look on her face, and Agatha ignores her as she hurries to catch up with Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice? Alice?” Agatha asks as she hurries to catch up with Alice. “What’s the plan, Alice?” Agatha asks, as she gets to Alice’s side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go back, go around, go anywhere but in that house,” Alice says and as soon as she says that they see that the house that leads to the next trial is now in front of them instead of behind them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, I agree, but the road clearly doesn’t,” Agatha comments. “So, I guess we go,” Agatha says, and the group continue to walk until they get to the house that is clearly red and just like the last house there is a large moon on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Waxing moon,” Agatha realises, as she takes note of the image.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Fire phase,” Nicky says, his mama nods, and one by one the group head into the house, Alice doing so hesitantly, where they will find the second trial. As they walk in Nicky finds a way to subtly touch everyone but his mom, who he knows can’t die, and to his relief he doesn’t feel anything that tells him that any of them are certainly going to die soon.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the incredible response to the last chapter. I know a lot of you have been waiting for this chapter, so I hope you like how I have handled it. As I am not working tonight the next chapter will be up in 8-13 hours depending on when I go to bed. Let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as everyone walk into the second trial everyone is once again changed, this time into seventies attire, very much looking like a rock group.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t drink anything. Don’t eat anything. Don’t touch anything,” Alice warns.
    </p>
<p>
     “Feels like there is a story there,” Rio comments, looking like she is having a great time, while Agatha walks over to a mirror to have a look at the attire she is wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, check me out,” Agatha says, once again disturbing Nicky, a feeling which is added to when he notices his mom doing just as his mama suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, seriously, we’re an album cover waiting to happen,” Nicky comments, focusing on how much he likes what he is wearing rather than how disturbed he is by the, very lowcut, outfits his moms are wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Road changes for the coven,” Lilia comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Road isn’t subtle,” Alice comments, knowing that she looks a lot like her mother and her band.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happens next?” Rio asks excited, even though she knows.
    </p>
<p>
     “A test,” Lilia answers, giving Rio a pondering look.
    </p>
<p>
     “No cheating this time,” Jen says to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, moi?” Agatha asks, pretending to be insulted, and Nicky raises his hand, as he has an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, Teen?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was just thinking about the invite on the mantel,” Nicky says as it was easier to think about that rather than how his mothers are disturbing him. “Maybe there is like, a riddle, or a kick off for this one too,” Nicky suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good idea,” Lilia suggests, and everyone starts to search Rio walks up to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Boo,” Rio says to Agatha, trying to get her attention, trying to get Agatha to acknowledge what she knows they both feel, and Agatha turns to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha says in a stern tone of voice before walking away.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As everyone else searches the area that has been turned into a recording studio Agatha, needing a break from Rio and what she feels whenever she is around her, heads straight to the sound booth and sits down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Knock, knock.” Rio says, walking into the room from the opposite door to the one Agatha used to walk in, not giving Agatha even a moment of piece. “How’s the quest for power going?” Rio asks curious, as she walks close to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s going,” Agatha responds, closing her vest a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are these people?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, they’re my new best friends!” Agatha says, putting on an excited voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm,” Rio says. “I’m feeling impatient. I’m feeling like I wanna cause some damage,” Rio say, pulling her knife, the one that matches the one their son has in his pocket, not that she is aware of that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re too early,” Agatha informs Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t up to me,” Rio admits, putting her knife back. “Magick, as it does, took the path of least resistance, ferried the closest, most appropriate candidate down, or up,” Rio says, gesturing with her hands, having no idea that it wasn’t just the way magick works, but everything she and Nicky set up, that caused her to be called to The Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm,” Agatha says, not overly surprised that Rio was called, but still not overly happy, as Rio looks out of the window.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you bring that boy?” Rio asks, pointing at Nicky as from her current perspective he is a mystery boy as for the first time, ever, she cannot tell who he is. The mere fact that she can’t tell who he is makes her extremely curious and she can’t help but wonder Agatha knows about the fact that, who seems like a random kid to her, is so completely hidden, even from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, many hands,” Agatha says, moving quickly to Rio as she doesn’t want Rio to focus on Nicky until she has more concrete evidence about who he is, because if she is wrong it is going to be painful enough for her, she doesn’t want that for Rio too. “Maybe The Road is like Switzerland,” Agatha says to Rio as she moves closer to her, not having the energy to keep fighting with Rio, and the truth is, not that she would admit it, she doesn’t want to. “What if we just call a truce?” Agatha asks. “Just... I don’t know. Just one more big adventure,” Agatha suggests, knowing that they have had a lot of adventures together, most of which are some of her favourite memories. “You and me,” Agatha says, as she feels Rio moving her finger around on her thigh, something which they both know Agatha loves.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like old times?” Rio asks hopefully, as even without her memories of Nicky being alive that’s what she wants most, for her and Agatha to go back to what they once were.
    </p>
<p>
     “Work and play,” Agatha confirms, knowing that Rio would be thinking about the same thing she is. “It could be nice, right?” Agatha asks, and Rio is sure it would be a lot more than just ‘nice’. “I just need these witches to get me to the end,” Agatha explains. “So, you tell me, what happens next,” Agatha says, subtly reaching out and pressing the intercom so that the others can hear Rio’s answer, as just because she isn’t going to tell them who Rio is doesn’t mean she can’t have Rio give them hints that will lead to them figuring it out on their own.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get the pleasure of watching you do what you do best,” Rio says, her voice playing throughout the other room, causing Nicky to wonder what the hell his moms are talking about, though he suspects he doesn’t want to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which is?” Agatha asks, in a seductive voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Kill all the witches around you, one by one,” Rio says, and as she does Nicky notices the others exchange shocked looks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then what?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “You get your power, and I get my bodies,” Rio says, Nicky being the only person other than Agatha who knows what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! That’s my coven you’re talking about,” Agatha says, in an over the top insulted voice. “I’m not that kind of witch anymore,” Agatha says, as Rio laughs, very much feeling amused with Agatha’s shenanigans, just like she always has.
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it!” Jen yells and as the others start to yell various things as they head closer to the others Nicky notices a record with ‘play me’ on it, and even though he knows it could be dangerous he also knows it’s likely a clue, but he also figures that it’s probably a good idea to distract everyone from what his moms just said, and because of that he plays the record.
    </p>
<p>
     The second the record starts to play there is a shriek from the record and everyone, except for Rio, have to grab their ears in pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is that?” Jen asks, as Agatha and Rio hurry out of the sound booth.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I thought it was a clue,” Nicky admits, as he did truly think that, even if he was also trying to distract everyone from his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “What makes you think that?” Alice asks, and as she does Agatha realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s spinning backwards,” Agatha says, and once she does a demonic voice starts to speak indistinctly which causes everyone to scream.
    </p>
<p>
     “Make it stop!” Jen yells.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop it. turn it off!” Alice yells.
    </p>
<p>
     As the others yell, clutching their ears, Agatha hurries towards the record player which she picks up and throws to the ground, breaking the play and the record; stopping the sound.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve been cursed,” Lilia realises as the metronome starts to tick, telling everyone that the trial has started.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think that means the trial started,” Rio says amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you smiling?” Jen asks confused, not understanding Rio at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a tourist,” Agatha says, deciding not to explain more than that as any other explanation will lead to way too many questions she doesn’t want to answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a psycho,” Jen comments, and she is even more disturbed when Rio excitedly nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “And nothing’s happening, maybe this curse isn’t so bad,” Nicky suggests, though he assumes they won’t be so lucky, and Agatha gives him a look which he is sure means ‘don’t be so stupid,’.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does anyone feel…” Alice starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel lighter,” Alice says amazed, not sure how that is possible, and moments after she says that everyone hears the sound of sizzling as Lilia gasps and yells.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it, Lilia? What’s wrong?” Nicky asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “It burns!” Lilia exclaims, as she falls to her knees.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s doing that to her? how do we stop it?” Jen asks, becoming upset, having no idea what is going on. “Alice, protect her!” Jen exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I borrow this?” Alice asks, taking Rio’s knife from here which she uses to draw a circle around Lilia as she chants in Latin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get it off me! It burns it burns!” Lilia yells, but as soon as Alice finishes the spell it is clear that Lilia is no longer in pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need you to draw one of those circles around me, right now,” Jen comments, as she really doesn’t want to go through what Lilia just went through.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Alice asks Lilia concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, breaking a curse,” Nicky says, trying to get everyone to focus on what they need to do. “Smudge sticks? A salt bath?” Nicky asks, reciting everything he remembers reading. “What if we locate and reason with the witch who cast the curse?” Nicky asks, looking at his mama to see what she thinks about that, noticing that his mom is just sitting on the couch reading a newspaper, completely unphased, as he does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Once vengeance is loose, you can’t real it back in,” Agatha says, knowing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do we do?” Nicky asks his Mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “The only way to end a curse is to face it,” Lilia reveals, and once she does Jen yells in pain.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as she hears Jen yell Alice once again uses Rio’s knife to carve a circle around Jen as she cats the protection spell, and as she does Nicky realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Her shoulders,” Nicky says, as he notices burns on Jen’s shoulders, burns in an exact pattern that Alice finds familiar.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do I have one too?” Lilia says, moving her top down to reveal that she has the same marks as Jen, and as she does everyone hears a rumbling in the distance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you hear that?” Nicky asks worried, and everyone is horrified by the sound they hear.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is that?” Jen asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the curse,” Rio reveals, still seemingly unphased by everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “The backwards record,” Nicky realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s the song forward?” Lilia asks, and as she does Alice checks, and is horrified by what she sees as she realises it’s her mother’s song.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s you, isn’t it?” Agatha says to Alice, putting her hands on her shoulders, and pulling her up. “You brought it in here,” Agatha says angrily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave her alone, Agatha,” Nicky says, not wanting anyone to be hurt, but as he moves closer to his mama and Alice, but as he does Agatha sticks out her hand, keeping Nicky back, clearly trying to protect him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t think it was real!” Alice exclaims.  “I thought it was me, that it’s my fault I can’t keep a job, that everything I touch turns to shit, that I couldn’t save her,” Alice says, her voice breaking, as tears come to her eyes, and she shows everyone her shoulder that has an identical scare to the ones that Jen and Lilia now have on their shoulders. “I convinced myself that they were birthmarks, even though she had the same ones,” Alice says, sounding upset.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, are we talking about a generational curse?” Jen asks shocked, knowing how bad that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you poor thing,” Lilia says sympathetically, understanding just how bad that is for the young woman.
    </p>
<p>
     “Poor us!” Jen exclaims. “Now we have her family’s old-ass curse!” Jen exclaims, feeling more worried about what that means for the rest of them than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     As Alice apologizes to the group Nicky feels an incredible amount of power and the next thing, he knows he is thrown through the air, and as he is the only thing he sees is the look of complete horror on his mama’s face as he is thrown the sound booth window.
    </p>
<p>
     Landing on the ground, Nicky feels pain, but he isn’t really sure where it comes from, and seconds later the rest of the coven, except Jen, but including both his moms, hurry into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Nicky says as everyone runs in to check on him. “I got attacked by the curse,” Nicky notes, noticing his mama grab her chest, while his mom gives him a pondering look, which tells him that even with the Sigil in place they both feel a connection to him, something which despite everything makes him feel very loved. “Does that mean I’m part of the coven?” Nicky asks, knowing he would like that. “Blessings and burdens alike?” Nicky asks, as Alice helps to brush the glass of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a lot of blessings in this group,” Lilia comments, and while Nicky disagrees with that, because for him the blessing is that he gets to spend time with both his moms, he knows he can’t actually say that, so he stays quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is he okay?” Jen asks, not moving out of the circle she is, and as Nicky gets to his feet, feeling even more pain, the group head back out to the main area of the ‘studio’.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what?” Agatha asks with a scoff. “You live in that circle now?” Agatha asks, noticing that Jen hasn’t moved.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe,” Jen responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look okay. Are you okay?” Alice asks Nicky concerned, as she knows if anything happens to him it’s her fault.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Nicky responds, even though he isn’t overly sure about that, because he knows they need to get the trial done, not worry about him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s the plan Agatha?” Rio asks, knowing that Agatha needs to get the others to focus, as the timer continues to tick down, and Agatha notices Alice glance at the piano.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re right, that’s the solution,” Agatha says, an idea coming to her, as Rio sits down at the drum set.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not,” Alice says, realising exactly what Agatha is thinking, and knowing that that is something she really doesn’t want to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm,” Agatha says with a nod, feeling that it is their only solution.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Nicky asks, looking between his mama and Alice, wondering what they have both realised.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to play Lorna’s ballad,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not playing that song,” Alice says, as she absolutely refuses to play that song.
    </p>
<p>
     “All signs point to a jam session,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What good will it do? The Ballad opens the Road, we did that, we’re here,” Alice reminds the others, wanting any excuse not to sing that song.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lorna’s version is different, though,” Nicky says, knowing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did Lorna want from the road?” Agatha asks, trying to make sense of that. “What was her intention?” Agatha asks, running through everything in his head.
    </p>
<p>
     “To save her daughter,” Rio answers, knowing that because if there is something she could have done to save Nicky she would have done it, having no idea that she has already done that very thing and that she is actually in the same room as her son. Hearing that Nicky debates, just for a second, lifting the sigil but because he knows him wanting to assure his mother, she did save him isn’t an emergency he doesn’t, even though he wants to.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should have burnt to a crisp years ago, but here you are,” Agatha says to Alice, knowing that Rio is right as just like Rio, and Lorna, she would have done whatever she could to save her son if she could, after all that’s exactly why she got the Darkhold. “Sullen and aimless, but alive,” Agatha points out. “That’s because at any given moment somewhere, someone is playing that song you hate so much,” Agatha explains. “Lorna’s Ballard is a protection spell, it protected you,” Agatha tells Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “And maybe now it can protect us,” Lilia says, and once she does, they hear a shrinking which tells them the ‘curse’ is getting closer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, who’s good on the piano?” Agatha asks, knowing that now she has figured out what they need to do they need to get on it. “Lilia?” Agatha asks, looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, I studied the zils, and a little pan flute,” Lilia reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, Jen?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ballet,” Jen answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on guys!” Agatha exclaims, starting to become frustrated.
    </p>
<p>
     “I play guitar, sort off,” Nicky comments, as he is still no good at it, but it is because of the advice Agatha herself gave him the courage not to quit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay great,” Agatha says, and Nicky hurries to pick up his guitar, taking off his jacket as he does. “Jen, you’re on bass,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m still in the circle…” Jen says as she doesn’t want to move.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen!” Agatha exclaims, and Jen reluctantly collects a bass to use.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, what do you know? Zils,” Lilia says, picking them up, as Alice reluctantly sits down at the piano, and with Rio already on the drums it leaves Agatha to be the lead singer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ooh Alice, play it right, and play it well, and maybe we don’t die,” Agatha says, and she starts to sing, as she does, she is burned by the microphone for a second, but she doesn’t let that stop her, she just continues to sing.
    </p>
<p>
     As they perform Lorna’s version of the Ballad Nicky notices that he has a glass imbedded in his side, and that he is bleeding pretty badly. As he notices the glass Nicky makes a silent apology to both his mothers, and just continues to play as he knows that finishing the trial is what matters.
    </p>
<p>
     As they get towards the end of the song Alice sees a physical manifestation of the spell, which gives her more determination, and as a group they finish the song, destroying the curse, and completing the trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did we do it?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s gone,” Agatha says with a chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it gone?” Jen asks, as the piano opens as an exit.
    </p>
<p>
     “We did it, yay!” Nicky says before feeling just how bad his injury is and collapsing, offering one more silent apology to his moms as he does, having faith that somehow they will, even without knowing who he is, find a way to save him as if there is one thing he can always count on it’s his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Teen! What happened?” Agatha asks terrified as she hurries towards him, having a feeling deep inside that she cannot explain which tells her that she cannot let anything happen to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong with him?” Lilia asks as Agatha and Jen get to Nicky to check what’s going on, and even Rio finds herself feeling concerned about the teenager who is a complete mystery to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s bleeding,” Jen reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got to get him out of here,” Agatha says, feeling that they need to do whatever they have to do to make sure he is okay, no matter what that is.
    </p>
<p>
     With some difficultly Agatha, Jen, and Alice carry Nicky out of the trial and once they are back on the road Agatha gently lays him on a tree stump.
    </p>
<p>
     “Careful, careful, watch his head,” Lilia advises. “Carefully. Gently,” Lilia tells the others, not wanting him to be hurt more than he already is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, hold on, hold on,” Jen says, as she takes the glass out of Nicky’s side and uses his own hoddie to try and control the bleeding.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s so much blood,” Agatha says horrified, having enough experience to know how bad that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got it,” Jen tells her, as she puts more pressure on the wound.
    </p>
<p>
     “What else can we do?” Agatha asks, becoming upset. “What else can we do?” Agatha asks, tears coming to her eyes, knowing that while she may not know who Nicky is what she does know is that she cannot allow anything to happen to him, and she certainly cannot lose him.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s young… he’s strong,” Jen says, unknowingly saying the same words Agatha and Rio both heard when Nicky was dying as a child.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t!” Agatha says angrily, knowing that age has nothing when it comes to death, looking at Lilia before turning to Rio. “Don’t,” Agatha pleads, in a heartbroken voice, begging Rio not to take someone else away from her, and hearing Agatha beg Rio knows deep down, for reason she can’t explain, that she cannot take this boy away from Agatha, and so she takes a half step back, which is enough for Agatha to realise there is hope. “Jen, what do you need, Jen?” Agatha asks, knowing she is Nicky’s best hope. “What do you need?” Agatha asks, needing her to figure out something, as she needs Nicky to be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh…” Jen says stuttering as she searches her mind for a solution.
    </p>
<p>
     “JEN!” Agatha exclaims, knowing that every second counts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Water… and moonlight,” Jen says, as the solution finally comes to her, as Agatha feels relief, and Rio continues to watch Agatha and Nicky, trying to figure out who he is as even now, when he is so close to death, she has no idea who he is, and that’s something she has never experienced before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh! Okay!” Alice says, hurrying to get what Jen needs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hurry! Hurry!” Agatha exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I got it, I got it,” Alice says, bringing the water back over to Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold it,” Jen says, handing Alice Nicky’s hoddie which she was using to slow the bleeding while she takes the water over to where the moonlight is shinning through.
    </p>
<p>
     “Three of swords,” Lilia says, as Jen starts to chant in Latin.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Jen finishes her chanting she carries the water back over to Nicky, and she pours it over his wound.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’re making it worse!” Agatha exclaims horrified.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait,” Jen tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re making it worse!” Agatha says horrified, but then to her absolute amazement the wound heals and Jen is able to use the hoddie to wipe away the blood that has now dried on his side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jennifer… look what you did,” Lilia says in amazement, and Jen feel extremely proud at what she did.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should move him somewhere more comfortable,” Jen suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha confirms, and the entire group, even Rio, work together to move Nicky someone more comfortable and even create a structure to keep him covered.
    </p>
<p>
     Once it is clear that Nicky is in a much better position Lilia, Jen, Alice and Rio head off to create a fire for themselves while Agatha lays her coat over Nicky and sits down next to him, feeling the need to stay close to him until he wakes up.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea how long has passed Agatha continues to sit by Nicky, while the others sit by the fire they made. As she watches Nicky sleep Agatha feels her suspicion about who he is grow, but even as it does, she cannot admit to herself what she is thinking as she knows she will be beyond devastated if she is wrong. Finally, after what feels like an eternity to her Agatha realises that Nicky has woken up so she immediately tries to hide how worried she has been.
    </p>
<p>
     “Still alive, great,” Agatha says to him, and Nicky smiles slightly, having spent enough time around Agatha when she was Agnes to know that even without knowing who he is she cares.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, did you put the Sigil on me?” Nicky asks, asking even though he knows the answer as while he cannot break the Sigil without breaking his promise to his mom, the agreement they made said nothing about Nicky not helping his mama realise the answer on her own.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha answers, then pauses as she realises something. “Actually, I wouldn’t know,” Agatha realises, with a slight laugh. “A Sigil works on the witch who cast it as well. That’s why we don’t use them as much. they’re super irritating,” Agatha admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can it be lifted?” Nicky asks, wanting to continue the conversation, wanting to continue getting a magical lesson from his mama, even if he already knows the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sigils are destroyed, not lifted,” Agatha explains. “And before you ask, ‘how’ in that curious little voice of yours, the answer is when they’re no longer needed,” Agatha explains, and Nicky smiles as even though he already knew everything Agatha already said, this is what he has wanted for so long, a magick lesson from his mama. “You don’t have to know a person’s name to know who they are,” Agatha says, and once she does Nicky feels hope that she has realised who he is, and because of that he feels comfortable enough to ask another question.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’re right about that,” Nicky tells her, trying to say without the Sigil activating that he is who she hopes he is, and while she is feeling more confident about her suspicion Agatha can’t quiet bring herself to believe it yet. “Agatha, what happened between you and Rio?” Nicky asks, as his mother was never exactly clear on that, all he know is they had some kind of fight, after he died, and that led to his mama using the Darkhold to hide from his mom, but she never explained exactly what happened and he has only suspected. The second he asks the question Nicky realises it was a mistake as Agatha looks less than happy. “I’m…” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Heal fast, we’re not staying here long,” Agatha says before getting up and walking away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get job, Nicky, great job,” Nicky mutters, feeling very much like an idiot, like he just screwed up majorly.
    </p>

     As soon as she walks away from Nicky Agatha heads towards the sounds of voices, and as she gets closer she sees the others sitting around the fire sharing stories. Once she is close enough Agatha uncrosses her arms, and puts them in her pockets, finding the flower Rio gave her in them, trying to make it seem like she is completely okay, even if she isn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “How is he?” Alice asks, as Agatha approaches the group.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mouthy,” Agatha says, as she hesitantly sits down next to Rio, exchanging a look with her as she does, still holding the flower.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a good sign,” Lilia comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, why don’t you show us your battle scars,” Jen says, feeling sure she has some.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well…” Agatha says, before unbuttoning the cuff on her shirt so she can lift her sleeve, and as she does she exchanges a look with Rio, who laughs, knowing the exact story Agatha is going to tell. “Knitting needle to the elbow,” Agatha says as she shows a large scar on her elbow, and Jen winces at that. “You ever hear of the daughters of liberty?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Alice and Jen say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Agatha says, causing everyone to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a scar,” Rio says as Agatha starts to re-do the button on her shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t,” Agatha says, without hesitation as not only does she knows it is impossible for Rio to get scars, but she long ago memorized every inch of Rio, in every form, so even if she were to have a scar Agatha would know and she knows he doesn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I do,” Rio responds, sounding annoyed. “A long time ago, I loved someone,” Rio says, causing Agatha to avoid looking at her while the others become extremely interested. “And I had to do something that I didn’t wanna do, even though it was my job,” Rio says, stressing ‘job’ as she looks at Agatha, who is still purposely advising looking at her. “And it hurt them,” Rio says, knowing that is an understatement, that helping their son move onto the afterlife did a whole lot more than just hurt Agatha, but she isn’t going to say that in front of everyone else. “She is my scar,” Rio says, and once she says the words she looks at Agatha, who briefly looks at her before looking away, feeling intense emotions as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna go stretch my legs,” Agatha says, before quickly getting up and walking away, needing a break from the intense emotions she is feeling at Rio’s confessions, emotions she would never admit to in front of the others.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After walking away form the others Agatha walks until she finds a clearing far enough from everyone else to have some privacy, and once she is alone she closes her eyes and tries to collect herself, feeling familiar feelings of panic and overwhelming emotions coming to the surface as after everything that has happened with Nicky and everything about Rio mere presence it is all starting to feel a little bit too much.
    </p>
<p>
     As she tries to collect herself, tries to ground herself, Agatha hears familiar footsteps, and she doesn’t need to turn around to know they belong to Rio. Seconds after she heard the footsteps Agatha feels Rio familiar touch as the eternal being starts to play with her hair, something which Agatha used to love. Allowing herself a few second Agatha leans into Rio’s touch, moaning, before turning around and once again pulling Rio into her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as she hugs Rio Agatha feels like she is home again, like she has a piece of her back, and for little while the two hold each other, until Agatha realises she needs to do a lot more than just hold Rio. Pulling back Agatha puts her hands either side of Rio’s face, and goes to kiss her, but before she can she is interrupted by Rio speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio says, as while she would want nothing more to sink into Agatha once more there is something going on that she needs to make sense of, and Agatha is the only person who can help her do that. “I don’t know who that boy is,” Rio reveals, showing more vulnerability than she showed when she admitted Agatha was her scar as due to her position as Death, she is meant to know everything, there’s not meant to be something that she doesn’t know.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. Hope you like this chapter, I am nervous about you reading it so I hope you like it. let me know what you think. I will update the next chapter in about 12 hours.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Yeah, that’s the point of a Sigil,” Agatha says, not understanding why that seems to be such a big deal to Rio, and she goes to lean in for a kiss once more, but to her annoyance Rio once again stops her.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s my point, Agatha, Sigils don’t work on me, at least they have never worked before now,” Rio tells Agatha, who realises the implications of that that now that Rio has spelled it out to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “And the only way this one would if is if it was purposely created to hide him not just from witches, but you, specifically,” Agatha says, realisation drawing on her as she realises how big of a deal that is, and while she moves back from Rio, she feels Rio’s hand still on her arm, keeping her from moving too far back. “That shouldn’t be possible,” Agatha says, knowing that the only reason she was able to hide from Rio is because of the Darkhold and every version of the Darkhold is gone so hiding from Death shouldn’t be possible. “Who is he?” Agatha asks, asking the question she has been trying not to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was hoping you would have a theory,” Rio admits, knowing that Agatha has spent more time with Nicky, at least that’s what she thinks with the Sigil in place.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have one,” Agatha admits, giving Rio a pointed look, as she doesn’t want to actually say it, and right away Rio realises what she is thinking. “Is it even possible?” Agatha asks, being able to bring herself to explicitly say what she is thinking, but because Rio knows her so well, she doesn’t have to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Before now I would have said no,” Rio admits, as she made sure Nicky was at peace, and in her experience, there is no way to come back from that, but of course, she doesn’t realise that she currently can’t remember a lot of her experience. “But now, feeling what feel, I honestly don’t know,” Rio admits, and only Agatha can appreciate how big of a deal it is for Rio to say the words ‘I don’t know,’.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha is so shocked by that, knowing that it is one thing for her to have her suspicions but that it is another thing entirely for Rio to admit that it’s a possibility, Agatha feels her legs give out, but she doesn’t fall as Rio holds onto her and gently lowers her to the ground where they both sit, Agatha sitting between Rio’s legs and leaning against her for support.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think he knows anything?” Rio asks, as she subconsciously starts to play with Agatha’s hair, trying to clam her, as he can tell how overwhelmed Agatha is and playing with her hair is something that has always helped Agatha in the past.
    </p>
<p>
     “He definitely knows more magic than he wants to admit to,” Agatha admits, as she has realised that. “And he asked me what happened between us,” Agatha explains, feeling that the fact that he asked that question is more evidence to support what she suspects.
    </p>
<p>
     “Curious,” Rio admits, finding that very interesting.
    </p>
<p>
     “But not concreate that he knows what the Sigil is protecting,” Agatha admits, wanting to desperately hope that he is who she thinks he is, but knowing that she can’t know for sure without a conversation that might not be possible with the Sigil in place.
    </p>
<p>
     “We could try asking him,” Rio suggests, and while Agatha would very much like to do that, she knows that there is something they have to figure out first.
    </p>
<p>
     “We could, but I think we need to understand why the Sigil was placed in the first place, and who cast it before we do that,” Agatha admits, as the Sigil would have to have been placed for a reason very good reason, a reason she needs to understand before talking with Nicky, and as she does Rio has a horrible thought.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…. What if it was one of us who cast it?” Rio says, and Agatha turns to look at her with a shocked look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “No. no, we there’s no way we would do that…. right?” Agatha asks, feeling devastated at the mere thought of one of them hiding Nicky from themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     “We would if we needed to protect him from something,” Rio says, knowing that there is nothing that they wouldn’t do to protect Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “What could be so bad that we would decide forgetting him, how he is back with us, was the best option to protect him?” Agatha asks, feeling terrified about what that could mean, as she knows that if Rio is right, and one of them cast the Sigil, which does seem like the most likely option if he is who they think he is, then it must be something truly awful they are trying to protect him from.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits, not seeing the whole picture, which is something she hasn’t experience before, and because of that she doesn’t like that feeling. “I just know that there is nothing we wouldn’t do to protect him, even if meant we don’t remember who he is,” Rio says, knowing that deep inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “He must be so scared,” Agatha says, tears coming to her eyes, having no idea just how much Nicky knows but knowing that whether he knows everything or very little it would be a very frighting situation to be in. “He must be feeling so alone,” Agatha realises, knowing that is one of the things she never wanted her son to feel, alone.
    </p>
<p>
     As an internal being there is not much Rio can’t handle, not much she that truly gets to her, but seeing Agatha Harkness upset is one of those things, it has been since they first met. Reaching out Rio gently wipes Agatha’s tears away, feeling Agatha lean into her touch as she does, and not sure who moves first both Agatha and Rio lean forward and kiss, doing so for the first time in over one hundred and fifty years, a kiss full of gentleness and care, full of everything they haven’t said.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you,” Agatha says to Rio once they break apart, after a few moments, admitting what she hasn’t been able to admit to herself for decades.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio says, gently pushing Agatha backwards so she is on her back in the soft leaves, feeling Agatha’s hands find her waist as she does. For a few moments Rio hovers over Agatha, staring at the beautiful woman below her, making Agatha feel like she is completely naked even with her clothes on, as Rio has always had the ability to truly see her in a way no one else can. “I’m yours,” Rio tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’m yours,” Agatha confirms, leaning up and kissing Rio, gently pulling her down on top of her as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     While they know they still have a lot to figure out, that they know there is a lot of history and hurt they will need to work through as Rio kisses and nibbles at Agatha’s neck they both know none of that matters right now, all that matters is being together again.
    </p>
<p>
     Moving slowly, as she wants to savour this, Rio slowly makes her way down Agatha’s body, kissing as she goes, feeling Agatha’s hand in her hair as she does, moaning as she leans into Rio’s touch, until she finally gets to the first of Agatha’s buttons that is actually done up.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking at Agatha, Rio, feeling her own desire bubbling below the surface, searches her eyes for any signs of hesitation, but as she doesn’t see them Rio undoes the buttons on Agatha’s shirt, gently pulling her up as she pushes Agatha’s shirt off her shoulders as she does. While Rio rids her off her shirt Agatha reaches back and undoes her bra, making it possible for Rio to remove it too.
    </p>
<p>
     After riding Agatha from both her shirt and bra Rio once again gently pushes her backwards, and once again starts to kiss down Agatha’s body once more, wanting to give her love as much pleasure as possible. With every kiss Agatha can feel herself starting to fall apart as Rio kisses and licks all the spots that she knows drives Agatha crazy.
    </p>
<p>
     Taking Agatha’s left nipple into her mouth Rio feels Agatha arch into her as she uses her right had not play with Agatha’s right nipple. As she feels Rio nibble her nipple Agatha has to bite down on her lip to stop herself from releasing the loud moan she is trying to keep in, but then to her disappointment she feels Rio pull away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t keep it in,” Rio says, as she wants to hear Agatha, wants to hear the pleasure she gives her. before leaning forward and kissing Agatha, feeling a faint taste of blood. “I want to hear you,” Rio says once she breaks apart from Agatha and she once again continues to make her way down Agatha’s body, hearing Agatha’s moans as she does, feeling her own desire increase as she hears the proof of the pleasure she is giving Agatha, a sound she has truly missed, as Agatha makes no effort to keep her moans in anymore, as Rio gives her nothing short of pure pleasure, just like she has given so many times in the past.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting to the waist band of Agatha’s pants Rio undoes the buttons then undoes the zipper, feeling anticipation rise as she gets closer to her goal, to what she has missed so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lift,” Rio says, and Agatha lifts her hips allowing Rio to pull down Agatha’s pants and underwear in one go, and once they are around her ankles Agatha kicks her legs free, so they fall to the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “So incredible,” Rio says, as she starts to kiss up Agatha’s legs, only having one destination in mind, knowing it is what they both want, what they both need.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re teasing,” Agatha says leaning into every single one of Rio’s kisses as she feels desire and want, rise up inside of her, becoming almost overwhelming.
    </p>
<p>
     “Savouring,” Rio corrects, as she continues to kiss up Agatha’s incredible legs, feeling Agatha spread beneath her, a sensation she has deeply missed, until she finally reaches Agatha’s centre.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri…” Agatha starts to moan, and then to her absolute joy she feels Rio’s tongue on the exact place she wants it to be most.
    </p>
<p>
     The second her tongue touches Agatha’s core Rio is once again rewarded with a taste she so divine, so incredible, that she has never forgotten it, a flavour so perfectly Agatha that she knows she will never get enough of it. While she desperately wants to do nothing more than devour Agatha, to bring her waves of never-ending pleasure Rio continues her gentle, tender, methods as she knows there will be plenty of time for hurried and frenzied later, right now she wants to feel Agatha slowly fall apart below her, wants to make sure Agatha feels as incredible as Rio knows her to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly lapping at Agatha, savouring every moment, every taste, feeling herself becoming wetter with every touch, Rio purposely avoids Agatha’s clit, as she tries to bring Agatha as much pleasure as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please…” Agatha begs, after a few minutes of incredible torture, feeling the incredible pleasure that only Rio can make her feel, and just when she thinks she is going to have to be more she feels Rio’s tongue where she wants it most, just as she feels one of Rio’s slender fingers enter her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let go, I’ve got you, let go,” Rio says, before using her tongue to apply more pressure to Agatha’s clit, as she gently moves a finger in and out of Agatha, feeling her tightness, her wetness and knowing there is no better feeling, and just as she bends her finger inside Agatha, and applies just the amount of pleasure to Agatha’s clit Rio feels her fall apart, as her first orgasm rushes over her.
    </p>
<p>
     After helping Agatha ride through not just one organsm, but two, Rio once again makes her way back up Agatha’s body until their lips meet, and they both taste Agatha. As she kisses Rio, feeling her own taste on her lovers’ lips Agatha can feel her pleasure rising again, despite her previous two orgasm, and because she knows the best way to satisfy that she flips them so that she is on top.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did say I could be in control,” Agatha says to Rio when she sees the confused look on Rio’s face, as while she doesn’t remember a whole lot before Wanda’s spell was broken, she remembers that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did,” Rio confirms, shivering with anticipation as Agatha starts to making her way down Rio’s body, planning on giving Rio just as pleasure as she just gave her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while, and several orgasms later, Rio and Agatha are back in each other’s arms for the first time in a century, both feeling incredibly satisfied, Agatha is leaning against Rio who has her arms wrapped tightly around the witch. While most people would consider death’s embrace to be cold for Agatha, it’s warm, there is nothing that makes her safer.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably head back to the others,” Agatha realises, even though she really doesn’t want do that, even though she would prefer to stay in Rio’s arms for as long as possible, she knows that that is something that they probably should do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to do that?” Rio asks as she kisses Agatha’s neck once again.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but I don’t want them to come looking,” Agatha admits, knowing there is one person in particular she doesn’t want to find her and Rio in their current states, but she is also trying not to think of the implications of that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll know if they do,” Rio admits. “Just rest, Mi Amour,” Rio says, as she kisses Agatha, wanting to give Agatha everything she can, and as she does, she feels Agatha shiver in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Agatha says, relaxing into Rio’s arms, the one place she has always felt safe, as she closes her eyes. “My heart beats for you too,” Agatha admits. “I love you… I never stopped,” Agatha admits, as while she felt a lot of anger, a lot of hate, the one thing she never stopped feeling, even though she constantly tried to deny it, is love.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Rio responds. “I’ve got you,” Rio says, gently encouraging Agatha, and she feels Agatha relax into her, and before long she has fallen asleep.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea what his moms are doing, and thankfully not realising that he doesn’t want to know, Nicky is feeling a little stronger, and because of that he carefully gets up, and still clutching Agatha’s jacket as he doesn’t want to let go if quiet yet, follows the sounds of hushed conversation until he gets to where Jen, Alice, and Lilia are.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, how are you feeling?” Alice asks, being the first to notice him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I think,” Nicky says, sitting down on the same log his parents were sitting on earlier, still holding onto Agatha’s coat. “Who helped me?” Nicky asks, assuming someone did for his injury to be so healed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did,” Jen says. “And I don’t want to make a habit of it so don’t get hurt like that again,” Jen warns Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll do my best,” Nicky says, looking around and not seeing the people he wants to see most. “Where are Agatha and Rio?” Nicky asks, feeling concerned about them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha said she needed to stretch her legs, Rio followed,” Alice explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have they been gone?” Nicky asks worried. “Should we go looking?” Nicky asks, feeling concerned about his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely not,” Lilia comments, not needed her powers to know it would be a very bad idea for them to follow Agatha and Rio right now. “It seemed like something they needed to talk about alone,” Lilia explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh,” Nicky mutters, not sure how to feel about that, as the implication in Lilia’s words are clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “They have some kind of history, right?” Alice asks. “I wasn’t imagining the tension?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, they definitely do,” Jen confirms. “Which is exactly why I have no intention to follow them and figure out what they are doing,” Jen comments, having a suspicion that she knows exactly what they are doing, but not wanting it to be confirmed, and Nicky pulls a face which no one else notices as he realises what Jen is implying, as while he does want his mother’s back together he doesn’t want to actually think about them being together.
    </p>
<p>
     “I second that,” Alice comments, as like Jen she suspects she knows what Agatha and Rio are doing, but she really doesn’t want her suspicion to be confirmed. “So how about we all try to get some rest,” Alice suggests. “You definitely could use it,” Alice says to Nicky, being sure that even with Jen’s healing he isn’t completely one hundred percent.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I could,” Nicky confirms. “But is it safe to rest here?” Nicky asks concerned, knowing he would feel better if he knew where his moms were.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably not,” Lilia admits. “But we should try to anyway, just stay together,” Lilia says, and Nicky frowns as he can’t help but think about how his mothers aren’t with them.
    </p>
<p>
     At Lilia’s words it is clear that both Jen and Alice were tried but just waiting to be told that it’s okay to rest, and once they get that reassurance, they both lay down, and make themselves comfortable, Jen making a sleep mask for herself as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     As the others lie down Nicky debates going in search for his mothers, but considering everything the others have implied he knows that wouldn’t be a good idea, and so instead of going in search of his mothers Nicky lays on the ground, and using Agatha’s jacket as a pillow, falls asleep without too much trouble.

      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support to the last chapter. It means everything to me. So, this is a bit of a supersized chapter as I couldn’t figure out where the place to split it. Hope you like. Please let me know what you think. I’ll post the next chapter in around 12 hours, maybe a little longer.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Between the fact that time moves differently on the Road, and the fact that Rio experiences time differently, Rio has no idea how long she has been holding Agatha as she sleeps, but she does know it gives her a feeling of peace, of belonging, that she doesn’t remember feeling for a long time.
    </p>
<p>
     As she knows Agatha so well, because she has spent so many years, watching her sleep Rio realises the second Agatha starts to wake up, and when she sees Agatha’s beautiful blue eyes looking at her Rio smiles at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’d you sleep?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Better than I have in a long time,” Agatha admits, even though she knows that technically she cannot remember the last three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says, as that’s what she wants for Agatha, and she leans down and gives Agatha a gentle kiss, and after a few moments they break apart. As soon as they break apart Rio notices the look on Agatha’s face. “Are you alright?” Rio asks concerned, as she knows the look on Agatha’s face well enough to know that something is bothering her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think the next trial is going to be mine,” Agatha admits, as the purple hue and the purple flowers that are now around The Road, seems to indicate that.
    </p>
<p>
     “If it is we’ll deal with it,” Rio assures Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just like before?” Agatha asks, as she feels Rio rub her hand up and down her hip, thinking about the last time they were on the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just like before,” Rio assures her, as she feels Agatha lean back into her a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably go back and join the others,” Agatha realises, even though she would like to remain in Rio’s arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we probably should,” Rio admits, but before doing that she leans down and gives Agatha one more kiss before they both break apart and get ready to re-join the others.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea what his mothers are doing, but feeling a very concerned about them, Nicky is wide awake in the clearing while Jen, Alice, and Lilia are all asleep. Not being able to keep in his concern any longer Nicky stands up, leaving Agatha’s jacket on the ground, and is just about to go searching for his moms when Rio, who is now fully dressed, walks into the clearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio? Is everything okay? Where’s Agatha?” Nicky asks, knowing that his voice is portraying just how concerned he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s fine,” Rio assures Nicky, immediately becoming suspicious of his concern. “She’ll join us soon,” Rio explains, giving Nicky a pondering look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, sounding relieved about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really care, don’t you?” Rio asks, and Nicky immediately realises that he is in trouble because Rio has a look on his face which he knows means she is trying to make sense of something.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Nicky says, honestly a little surprised that the Sigil didn’t activate, and Rio takes a step towards him, making Nicky realises, that in all there planning, they made a mistake in not considering that Rio would be suspicious of the fact that such powerful magic was being used to hide him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you know who you really are?” Rio asks, and Nicky feels the Sigil working, preventing him from answering, but before he can think of a solution that will allow him to give some form of an answer, they are both distracted by Lilia gasping, and bolting upright, causing everyone else to wake up.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re coming, we have to go,” Lilia says panicked.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Alice asks confused, as everyone in the clearing look at Lilia for answers about what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “The summoning spell, we left the door open,” Lilia reveals, and because he knows who is after him, and his mama, Nicky has a suspicion that he knows how bad that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you talking about? What did you see?” Alice asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go on, Lilia, tell them,” Rio says, as now that the Salem Seven have joined them on the Road, she can feel them, sense their souls, being able to do so because there are so few people on the Road. While she can tell that they are on The Road what she can’t tell is exactly where they are.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Salem Seven,” Lilia says and Jen gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     “Black robes, working in creepy perfect unison?” Nicky asks, even though he already knows, because he knows that everyone else has to understand just how bad what they are facing is, and Lilia nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “When Agatha killed her original coven…” Lilia starts to explain.
    </p>
<p>
     “By stealing their power,” Jen adds, once again making Nicky feel annoyed, but before he can say something about that his mom beats him to it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because her own mother tried to have her executed,” Rio says, an edge to her voice, as she will not let anyone talk badly about Agatha when it comes to this particular matter, especially because they don’t know the real story.
    </p>
<p>
     “Executed?” Nicky mutters shocked as while he knew bits and pieces of what happened between his mother and Evanora, as he felt the magic that was used when he went to Salem, he didn’t know the specific details as it was something his mom tried to protect him from.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you really defending a noted serial killer, you creepy lurker?” Jen asks, having not heard what Nicky muttered, and Rio becomes angrier at Jen, feelings Nicky shares.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, someone finish the story,” Alice requests, as she has never even heard about what happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “When Agatha murdered her sisters witches, she spared their young children,” Lilia explains, and both Alice and Jen are surprised by that, while the others already knew.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, and then they became a feral, hive-minded cover bent on revenge,” Rio reveals, as Agatha who is now dressed, comes running back into the clearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whoa, ah, the moral of the stories kids, is finish what you started,” Agatha says as she picks up her jacket from where Nicky dropped it. “Also, mercy is overrated,” Agatha says as she puts her jacket back on. “All right everyone, pack up your shit! Let’s go!” Agatha exclaims, and as soon as she does everyone goes running.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha tells them to go everyone starts to run, only Agatha, Nicky, and Rio realising just how much danger they are in, though Lilia has a suspicion. After about a minute of running the group gets to what seems like an enclosed path which is covered either side in branches in the walls of the path.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh jeez! That was ahead of us,” Jen says as they hear a wolf bark, most of the group knowing that the Salem Seven are able to turn into Animals, and then seconds later they hear the members of the Salem seven scream, and they also hear Lilia scream too.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s behind us,” Alice realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re surrounding us,” Nicky reveals, as he can ‘feel’ their magic, feel how intensely their magic is corrected, which means he can tell where each of them are.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re trapped,” Lilia says panicked and as he does Nicky gets an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry Mama,” Nicky thinks to himself, feeling guilty about what he is about to suggest because he knows it will lack the significance it should have, but he honestly has no other ideas. “What about a hexenbesen?” Nicky asks, avoiding looking at both his moms as he suggests it because he knows that their first hexenbesen together was meant to be special, it wasn’t meant to be a means to survive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Brooms? Horrible idea,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely not,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah!” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a terrible idea,” Agatha
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio once more says, and it amuses Nicky to know the person who has spent the last eight years telling him he is not allowed to fly is now the one who is agreeing to the idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, if you’re all too cool for a practical means of escape…” Nicky says, feeling the Seven get closer, but before he can even give another argument, they all hear the Salem Seven screech which causes them all to gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, booms are great,” Alice says approvingly, and Agatha, Rio, Alice, Jen and Lilia all start to pull branches off the walls of the path so that they can use them to create brooms.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no,” Jen says annoyed as she pulls off her broom.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is so humiliating,” Lilia says, as she starts to put her broom together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why does your generation hate them so much?” Nicky asks Lilia curious, as he knows about his mama’s feelings about brooms thanks to his mom, but what he doesn’t know is why Lilia is so against them, and he is curious about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Brooms have been co-opted by the holiday industrial complex as an absurd emblem of our culture,” Lilia explains. “Worse yet, they’re an obvious symbol of female domesticity,” Lilia explains, as she, like Rio, Agatha, Jen and Alice continue to put their brooms together.
    </p>
<p>
     “And they’re basics,” Jen says and as he does Nicky hears his moms chanting in Latin and so he turns to look at them, and he sees them walking around each other, performing the ritual for a hexenbesen, and once they are done they exchange their brooms, Nicky noticing their hands lingering on one another just a little longer than he would expect, as Jen and Lilia both start their ritual too.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s about selfishness Teen,” Agatha tells Nicky, wanting to give him this particular lesson.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, is it?” Jen asks annoyed, being pretty sure that it is pretty hypocritical for Agatha to be the one saying that. “Tell us more,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “We fly together, or not at all,” Agatha reveals, ignoring Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Alice says, tapping Nicky on his shoulder with a broom and he turns to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get one?” Nicky asks, as he wasn’t sure how that was going to work, wasn’t sure if he was going to have to ride on the back of one of his mothers’ brooms.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you give me one back yeah,” Alice confirms, and as soon as he hears that Nicky hurries to the wall, needing to climb a little and pulls a branch free. As soon as he pulls the branch free Nicky passes it to his mama, but before he can climb down, he hears an owl hoot, feels magic he knows belong to a member of the Salem Seven, and he is thrown onto his back, as he is attacked by a member of the Salem Seven.
    </p>
<p>
     Not even thinking about it Nicky is about to use his magic to fight back when he hears his mom’s voice say, ‘be careful using your magic, it makes your identity clear,’ but before he can even think if it will be worth it Alice uses the broom she is holding to hit the Salem seven member.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get of him!” Alice yells, as Nicky gets back onto his feet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Teen, hurry! Just finish the ritual!” Agatha exclaims, feeling afraid that something is going to happen to him. “Finish the ritual!” Agatha exclaims, knowing that they need to get moving, and Nicky and Alice do exactly that. “All right, let’s go,” Agatha says, the second Alice and Nicky finish their ritual.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Agatha says go she, Rio, Alice, Jen, and Lilia jump onto their brooms and start to fly without a problem while Nicky runs behind them, feeling confused, as he has no idea what to do because his mom wanted his mama to teach him everything about a Hexenbesen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait? How do we do this?” Nicky asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep up, Teen,” Agatha tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, you’ve got this, you’ve got this,” Nicky says to himself, and he finally manages to jump onto the broom, and fly for the first time in his life.
    </p>
<p>
     “Try praying to the divine mother, Kiddo,” Lilia tells Nicky, who can’t help but look at his mama, as he knows this was supposed to be something they shared when they both knew who they were, when they both understood the significance.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got to get off the road,” Alice tells the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “Move!” Agatha says, and in perfect unison they fly up into the sky, flying together as a real coven.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is incredible,” Alice says amazed
    </p>
<p>
     “I haven’t done this in centuries,” Lilia admits, feeling amazed, at peace, as they continue to fly.
    </p>
<p>
     As they fly as his mama watches his mom Nicky can’t help but think about how this is something he has wanted to do for so long. While it’s not perfect, and is definitely something he wants to repeat when his mama knows who he is, it still feels pretty incredible to fly with both his moms and other people who are becoming important to them all, even if his mothers would never admit that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why haven’t we been doing this all along?” Nicky asks amazed, but as soon as he asks the question it is answered as they are all flipped upside down.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is going on?” Lilia asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “The road is forcing us down,” Agatha explains, as they are forced to the ground, and while Rio cackles in amusement everyone else screams in terror.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re going to crash!” Alice exclaims terrified.
    </p>
<p>
     “It won’t leave us,” Jen says, and as they get closer to the ground the brooms even out and they are able to keep flying, only a little above the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, we’re okay,” Jen assures the others, and as she does Nicky sees something in the distance.
    </p>
<p>
     “THERE! The next trial,” Nicky says, pointing to a cabin, and the group fly there, needing to fly through a member of the Salem seven to get inside, but managing to all barrel inside before something else bad happens.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as the group get into the cabin Rio realises that Agatha’s suspicion was right, and this is her trial. Just like the last trial everyone has been transformed into different clothes, in this case 80s sleepover wear, while the ‘house’ itself looks like a sleepover treehouse.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay. All right. Okay, okay, we’re okay,” Agatha, who was the last one into the trial, says, trying to reassure everyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we’re not!” Jen exclaims horrified. “The entire Halloween aisles outside waiting for us!” Jen exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “And it doesn’t look like they can get in, does it, Jen?” Agatha asks, and Nicky realises she is right as he can’t ‘feel’ their magic. “So, all we have to do is complete the trial and continue on before they can reach us. Okay,” Agatha says to the others, with the exception of Nicky, who is looking for something, are looking around.
    </p>
<p>
     “How? Kiss, marry, kill?” Alice asks, as that’s what it seems like from the outfits they are wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “My spell book! I can’t find it!” Nicky says, finding his knife but not the book, becoming upset as his mom gave him that book and it means a lot to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’d you have it last time?” Lilia asks in a gentle voice, trying to help him calm down, and as he realises Nicky feels his heart sink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Flying on a broom,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Forget it, you can take the training wheels off,” Agatha says, suspecting that he doesn’t actually need them, and not realising that Nicky cares more about the significance of the book rather than what is actually inside of it, and Lilia gives him a reassuring look, as the group start to look around.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whose trial is this?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s,” Rio answers, without hesitation, knowing that she would have been able to tell that even if she and Agatha didn’t talk about it earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’d you know?” Nicky asks his mom, curious about how she realised so quickly, but also having a really bad feeling about how this is going to go, but to his relief he feels nothing that tells him someone is a certainty to die, but he also knows he can’t be sure of that without touching everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     “A blood moon. When the veil between the living and the dead is at it’s thinnest,” Lilia explains, pointing to a picture, Nicky being the only one in the room who currently knows that there was a time when the veil was even thinner.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, I thought talking to the dead was your department,” Nicky says to Lilia, as while he knows a little about his mama’s abilities, he doesn’t know everything as Rio always knew that Agatha would want to teach him herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, common misconception, I read people, I read time, but talking to spirits was just a con,” Lilia reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “And who better to commune with the dead than someone who’s put so many in a grave?” Rio asks, using her knife which has been transformed into a brush a microphone which she points at Agatha as a Ouija board flies out and onto a table, which Nicky walks over to.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to Ouija,” Nicky says, having a bad feeling about this, and this time he is sure it has nothing to do with his ability to sense death, and as soon as he says that the timers on the watches everyone is wearing start to beep.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not a verb,” Agatha says, really not liking the idea of this, but as she glances at Rio she gives her an encouraging loo, Rio’s subtle way of assuring her that everything will be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, we have to do this,” Nicky says, and everyone, except for Agatha who stays back a little, walks over to him. “Uh, Spanish… Chinese…. Ah, English,” Nicky says as while he could easily read the Spanish, he doesn’t want to deal with the questions that will come along with that. “Number one do not use the Ouija board alone,” Nicky reads, and everyone gestures as if to say they aren’t alone. “Number two. Do not speak over each other,” Nicky says, and as soon as he says that everyone starts to speak over each other. “THREE!” Nicky exclaims, trying to get everyone’s attention so that they stop talking over each other. “Do not taunt the spirits,” Nicky reads, and once he does everyone turns to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I repeat, do not taunt the spirits,” Nicky reads, looking at his Mama. “Four, do not ask about death,” Nicky says, fighting to keep the amusement out of his voice at that, but only Agatha and Rio notice, causing them to exchange looks as that is another piece of evidence that supports their theory. “Five, always end your session with goodbye,” Nicky reads. “Six, do not, under any circumstances, remove your hand from the planchette, if you do a spirit will be released,” Nicky reads.
    </p>
<p>
     “What does it say on the back?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “For ages three and up,” Nicky says once he reads the back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Lilia says and and everyone except for Agatha sit down around the small coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wonder who’s waiting for you,” Nicky says to his mama, dreading what is going to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “And with what trauma,” Jen says, in a tone of voice that suggests she is going to enjoy Agatha’s suffering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Piff, it could be literally anybody,” Agatha says, trying to make it seem like she isn’t at all phased, but Rio know she is, and Nicky suspects she is, and she reluctantly sits down next to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she is sitting down Agatha can’t help but think about how much she doesn’t want do this, and everyone puts their hands on the planchette, Nicky using the opportunity to briefly graze everyone else’s fingers and confirm for his own reassurance that no one is a certainty to die soon.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mother, Maiden, Crone, spirits be known,” Agatha says purposely saying the goddesses in the wrong order, and because of that she makes the planchette moves, while making it seem like she isn’t doing exactly that. “I can hear something, shh,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not moving it, are you moving it?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shh,” Agatha says to them, but that was exactly what she wanted, everyone else being so distracted that they didn’t notice what was going on. “Is someone here with us, during this Witching hour?” Agatha asks, and once she asks the question, she moves the planchette to Yes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Jen reads.
    </p>
<p>
     “All right, and who, may I ask, do we have the pleasure of communing with?” Agatha asks, and she once again starts to move the planchette.
    </p>
<p>
     “M, R, S, H, A, R, T,” Nicky says, saying the letters as his mama pushes the planchette to each of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mrs Hart?” Alice asks, as Nicky feels dread rise up inside of him, as he worries that what he did is going to be revealed and he isn’t going to be able to explain why he did what he did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Girl, feeling better?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s your face?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No taunting,” Lilia says, and once she does everyone gasps, and as they do Lilia pulls her hand off the planchet, which gives Agatha the exact opening she was hoping for.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your hands. What did you do?” Agatha asks, putting on a horrified tone of voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t do it!” Lilia exclaims, and once she does Agatha moves back from the table, gasps and spins her head around.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, my, what a journey,” Agatha says, putting on a voice to make her sound like Sharon, and right away Rio realises what is going on. “There I was, living my tiny life in the burbs, baking casseroles, linking into conspiracy theories on Facebook, drinking before noon, and there you were brining chill and thrills and bringing on my own early demise!” Agatha says, continuing to make her voice sound like Mrs Hart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Listen, Mrs Hart…” Lilia starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not Mrs Hart,” Alice says, as like Rio she has released what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s Sharon Davis,” Nicky says, assuming that is what Alice meant.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am, I’m Sharon Davis,” Agatha says, still putting on the voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s Agatha,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s just scared,” Rio says, knowing that because she knows Agatha so well, and she taps the beanbag next to her, encouraging Agatha to sit back down, and Lilia clears her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I thought it was pretty good,” Agatha admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “The clock is ticking,” Alice says, and Agatha reluctantly sits back down, no one other than Nicky noticing that she is sitting a little closer to Rio than she was sitting before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine. Well, let’s get to it, right,” Agatha says, and everyone puts their fingers back on the planchette. “Maiden, mother, crone, spirts be known,” Agatha says, purposely saying it right, and as soon as she does the lights flicker, and everyone feels the wind rustling. “Who is here with us tonight?” Agatha asks, and as soon as she does the planchette starts to move again, this time on it’s own.
    </p>
<p>
     “D, E, A, T, H, death,” Jen and Alice reads, and as soon as they do Rio laughs, and Nicky tries really hard not to, Nicky having no fear of death because he is never going to be scared of his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re not supposed to ask about death,” Nicky reminds everyone, and they all shush him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “P, U, N, I, S, H,” everyone reads.
    </p>
<p>
     “Punish,” Nicky says, having a really bad feeling about this because he knows who’s trial it is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who do you wan to punish?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “A, G, A, T, H,…” Everyone says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop, alright, stop,” Agatha says, becoming panicked.
    </p>
<p>
     “A, G, A, T, H, A,” Everyone but Agatha says, as the planchette keeps spelling out the same letters, Agatha’s name.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop, make it stop!” Agatha exclaims, becoming upset, as the letters keep getting spelled out. “Stop make it stop!” Agatha exclaims. “Stop it, stop it, stop it,” Agatha yells, pulling her hands away as everyone starts arguing, wand as soon as Agatha pulls away, she is slid across the room on the floor as everyone hears a shrieking causing everyone, except for Rio who is amused, to stand up and cover their ears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Make it stop!” Nicky exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would if I could!” Agatha responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do they want?” Alice asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’ve already told us, punish Agatha!” Jen exclaims, and as soon as she says that everything settles down, neither Nicky nor Rio planning on letting that happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Meaning we need to…” Alice starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Jen says, taking out her retainer, closing the case in a dramatic fashion. “It’s how we pass the trial,” Jen comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I don’t think so,” Agatha says, from where she is sitting on the ground, knowing she really doesn’t want that to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “And after everything she’s done, the lies, the cheating, the complete utter lack of humanity…”’ Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “No! there has to be another way!” Nicky exclaims, not planning on letting anyone hurt his mama, even it means breaking the Sigil and putting himself in danger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right yes,” Agatha says, it meaning everything to her to have Nicky defend her because of who she suspects he is.
    </p>
<p>
     “We could just tie her up,” Lilia suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t be serious,” Nicky says shocked, not being able to believe that everyone is turning on his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t…” Agatha starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Humiliation would work too,” Alice suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, or we could just slit her throat,” Rio suggests, pulling her knife, doing so because it would fit the ‘punishment’ but she would be able to heal Agatha from that kind of physical injury so it wouldn’t be a big deal, something which Agatha realises, but Nicky is very confused about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously? Not the time,” Nicky says to his mom, knowing from experience that that is just how she can be sometimes, but feeling that it is really not appropriate, and once again both Agatha and Rio are surprised by his reaction, but know it’s not the time to address that.
    </p>
<p>
     “And people ask me why I don’t have female friends,” Agatha comments, though she realised exactly what Rio’s suggestion really meant, even if no one else did.
    </p>
<p>
     “But we were getting along, weren’t we? We were clicking, there was unity,” Nicky says, trying to remind everyone of the good so he can calm the situation down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Familars don’t get a vote,” Jen says, and once again Nicky is tempted to use his magic to send her flying across the room, but he keeps in control, which is good because seconds after she says that the lights go off and Agatha disappears.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Lilia asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where did she go?” Nicky asks panicked, not wanting to loose his mama. “Oh, my gosh, what’s happening?” Nicky asks confused, having no idea what is going on, and subconsciously moving closer to his mom, even if she has no idea who he is at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, let’s talk about this for a minute, we’re sisters in the craft, remember?” Jen asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need light,” Alice says, and everyone quickly searches for sources of light, and as they do they all hear what sounds like heavy breathing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does anyone else hear that?” Lilia asks, and once she does everyone screams as they see Agatha, who is clearly now possessed, on the ceiling and she drops down to the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s faking it,” Jen says, as Agatha does a backwards bend.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look at her face!” Alice exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sweetheart, you okay?” Rio asks, not phased by what is going on, but concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god,” Nicky says, shocked about seeing his mother like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not faking! Not faking!” Alice exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s she doing?  Where’s she going?” Rio asks, and because he knows his mother so well Nicky can hear that she is concerned, and that concerns him more than anything else, as he knows it’s a big deal for Rio to be concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not Agatha!” Nicky yells terrified. “She’s possessed! For real this time!” Nicky says as he is pushed into a corner as his possessed mother comes towards him, and even barks at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! Over here!” Jen explains, and Agatha grabs holds of Jen and pushes her against a pole.
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Nicky exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop it! Let her go! Alice exclaims. “What are you doing? You’re hurting her,” Alice says, and once she does Lilia turns on the lights, causing Agatha to disappear. “Jen, Jen,” Alice says, hurrying over to Jen to make sure she is okay, as everyone comes to the middle of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “AGATHA! Where is she!” Rio says, pulling her knife. “All right, where is she!” Rio exclaims, becoming angry and actually showing how worried she is. “AGATHA!” Rio exclaims, and once she does a silver mist becomes a person, a person Rio, unfortunately, recognizes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is that?” Nicky asks confused, as the entire group move closer to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “That is a ghost,” Rio explains. “I hate ghosts,” Rio says annoyed, as she can’t control ghosts, knowing that she hates this ghost in particular.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who… who are you?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Evanora Harkess of the Salemites,” Evanora says, shocking Nicky who realises the significance of that, and wonders if he is about to learn why his mom would tell him very little about her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey Mom,” Agatha says, from the upper level where she was moved to. “It was nice having you in my body for a second there. I’ve never felt so close to you before,” Agatha says, trying to dismiss how much of a big deal it is, even though the last thing she wants is to be close to her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “My coven risked everything to kill her, and you fools have willingly joined her,” Evanora says, and while Nicky isn’t overly surprised by that because of the pieces he has put together that doesn’t make it any easier to hear, as Rio puts her knife back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stop embarrassing me in front of my friends, Mom,” Agatha says, trying to make it seem like she isn’t at all phased by what her mother is saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do we do? Do we banish her?” Jen asks, looking at Lilia for help as she assumes Lilia will know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Emotions ties them to this plane,” Lilia explains. “They have unfinished business,” Lilia explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, let’s finish her business,” Nicky says, knowing that he has to do whatever he has to do to make sure Evanora doesn’t hurt his mama again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want?” Nicky asks Evanora and because of her suspicions about who Nicky is Agatha knows she doesn’t want him anywhere near Evanora.
    </p>
<p>
     “You must finish the Witches Road, without Agatha,” Evanora says, and neither Nicky nor Rio have any intention of allowing that to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “She means punish Agatha,” Lilia realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave her with me,” Evanora says.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Nicky and Rio yell together.
    </p>
<p>
     “No way,” Rio adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “A minute ago, you were ready to slit her throat,” Jen says surprised, not understanding Rio at all.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well, her mother can’t have her,” Rio exclaims, knowing there is no way she is going to let that happen, and as she does Evanora moves towards Rio as Agatha climbs down the stairs from the upper level.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom? Why do you hate me still?” Agatha asks, as that is what she has always wanted to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were born evil,” Evanora says, and Rio knows that is not true. “I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body,” Evanora says and once she does both Rio and Nicky, who understands a little more why his mom never talked about Evanora, are devastated to hear that, while Alice, who from her perspective had the most incredible mom, who did everything she could to keep her safe, is horrified.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have to go,” Jen says, refusing to let Evanora’s words get to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen!” Nicky exclaims, not being able to believe she is suggesting that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no! There’s no flood here. There’s no fire, the only danger to us in this trial is Agatha Harkness,” Jen says, and as soon as she does Agatha starts to become upset.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, take me with you! Don’t leave me! Please don’t go!” Agatha exclaims, starting to fall apart in a way only Rio has seen before.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t leave her here!” Nicky says as he tries to reach for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, take me with you! Please, don’t leave me here with her. I can be good, please!” Agatha exclaims, reaching for Nicky, but before she can get close, Evanora flies back into her body, possessing her once again.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, not again!” Lilia exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave her alone!” Alice exclaims, and she sends a blast towards Agatha, hitting her with it.
    </p>
<p>
     As he sees Alice’s power hit Agatha, and knowing what is about to happen, Nicky, who realises he feels nothing that says a death is a certainty, knows there is hope and because of that he knows exactly what he needs to do. Running from where he is with Lila and Jen, behind Alice, Nicky recites the phrase that will destroy the Sigil.
    </p>
<p>
     “What language is that’s?” Jen asks confused, hearing what Nicky is saying, as Evanora is ejected from Agatha, who starts to siphon Alice’s power, her life-force, as Nicky, feeling as the Sigil is destroyed, gets to where he wants to be, directly to Agatha’s left.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama stop!” Nicky exclaims, everyone being able to hear what he is saying because the Sigil is destroyed. “It’s me, Nicky!” Nicky says, raising his arm, in the same way Alice has raised hers, not sure what he is going to do, but knowing he has to do something.
    </p>
<p>
     “NICKY NO!” Rio, who has just been bombarded with her memories, yells, her voice full of absolute horror.

<p>
<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the incredible response to the last chapter. I do feel a little bad about the cliffhanger.
    </p>
<p>
     So, the next chapter won’t be out until after the final comes out, in fact, it will be posted closer to my normal time of 6pm my time. Also, I have written the last chapter of this story, unless I change something it will be 37 chapters in total. Again, thank you so much for your support, you have no idea what it means to me.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As she hears her son confirm who he is, and hears the absolute horror in her love’s voice, Agatha is able to do something she has never done before, turn away from someone she is siphoning power from and look at her son, causing Alice to be a little weakened, but still alive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky?” Agatha asks, looking at him in amazement, tears coming to her eyes, as for over a century this is all she has wanted, her son back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama,” Nicky says, lowering his arms, letting go of the magic that was on the tips of his fingers about to be released, before hurrying towards her and doing what he has been wanting to do for the last eight years; hugging her; “I’ve missed you so much,” Nicky says as he hugs his mama tightly, and as she watches them hug Rio smiles, feeling her heart full of love, knowing what this would mean to both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve missed you too, so much,” Agatha says, pulling back a little so she can look at her son, memorize everything about the way he looks now. “I love you,” Agatha assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too, Mama,” Nicky responds, feeling beyond amazed, as this is what he has wanted for so long.
    </p>
<p>
     “How? How are you here?” Agatha asks, feeling both amazed and confused about how this is possible, as the Sigil breaking hasn’t helped her with that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom,” Nicky answers, and as he does Agatha looks over at Rio, but doesn’t move away from Nicky, while Jen and Lilia are checking on Alice, wanting to make sure she is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “When Thanos used the power of all the Infinity Stones in one go, he didn’t only cause half of the universe to disappear, but caused the entire universe to fall into chaos,” Rio explains. “The veil was made thinner than it has ever been before. I was able to punch through it, I found Nicky and brought him back with me,” Rio explains, feeling that is the best explanation to give at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “You always said that was impossible,” Agatha says to Rio, remembering the fights they had about that, trying to comprehend exactly what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was, until it wasn’t,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom was weak for days after she brought me back,” Nicky tells his mama. “She actually slept,” Nicky tells his mama, wanting to help her understand what that means, as while he did not understand the significance of that as the time he does now, and right away she does, and Agatha knows that is something she is going to talk to Rio about at a later point, when it is just the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, Thanos. That was eight years ago,” Agatha realizes, as she starts to comprehend just how much she has missed. “Why didn’t you…” Agatha starts to ask, looking at Rio, anger in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Darkhold,” Rio says, before Agatha can even finish the question, the accusation, as she knows exactly what Agatha is going to say, as she was expecting it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You couldn’t find me,” Agatha realizes, anger slipping away, knowing that it would be easier if she could blame someone for the fact she missed out on eight years with her son, but the truth is she is the only one to blame.
    </p>
<p>
     “We tried, Mama, we really did. We never stopped trying to find you,” Nicky assures her, not wanting his mama to think they forget about her.
    </p>
<p>
     “As soon as you lost that damn book we travelled to Westview, but….” Rio starts to explain.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was too late, and I was under Wanda’s spell,” Agatha realizes. “You been in Westview the last three years?” Agatha asks, looking between Nicky and Rio, feeling that she has a lot of questions about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Trying to figure out how to break the spell, yeah,” Nicky tells his mama. “Mama, I’m so sorry I couldn’t break it sooner, I’ve tried, I’ve really tried,” Nicky assures his mama, needing to make that clear, guilt perfectly clear in his voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Sweetheart, you have nothing to apologize for, absolutely nothing,” Agatha says, before hugging him once again, knowing that the knowledge that she has lost eight years with her son, and Rio, because of her own selfish choices, her own quest for power, and that Nicky blames herself, is the biggest punishment she could ever receive.
    </p>
<p>
     “The door!” Alice, who has been helped to her feet, says as the way out of the trial appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t understand, how is that a punishment?” Jen, who now understands why Nicky acted the way he did towards her during the first trial, says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha was punished,” Lilia explains. “She learnt what she lost because of her choices, and the effects those choses had on the person she loves most,” Lilia says, understanding exactly what happened. “Agatha, we should go, we don’t know what happens if we stay in a trial after it’s finished,” Lilia advises, trying to do so in the gentlest way.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s right,” Rio says to Agatha, and as an understanding passes between them and Agatha nods.
    </p>
<p>
     As the group make their way out of the trial, Jen and Lilia helping Alice, while Agatha keeps her arm around Nicky, they are so distracted that they don’t see a white wisp of energy follow them as they forgot a key rule of using the Ouija board.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As they once again leave a trial the group find themselves back on The Road where there is a green hue to the entire road.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should rest,” Lilia suggests, once they have all left the trial, knowing that Alice definitely needs to rest because of how physically she is drained while Agatha, Nicky and Rio could use a rest because of how emotionally drained they clearly are.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we risk that with the Seven?” Jen asks, feeling like they can’t, but she cannot help but look worriedly at Alice, who is alive, but clearly weakened.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re not close,” Nicky reveals, deciding that now everyone knows who he is there is no point in hiding, at least some, of what he can do.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know?” Agatha asks her son, not knowing why he is clearly so certain about that, and with a sad ache she adds it to the list of things she doesn’t know about her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can, for lack of a better description, feel magic,” Nicky explains, feeling glad to finally be able to explain that particular ability of his to his mama as he knows he got it because of her. “The Seven are so intertwined, so connected, that their magic feels completely unique. I can tell when they get close; there not close at the moment,” Nicky explains, looking at his mother as he gives the explanation, as she’s the one he wants to talk to, but everyone hears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Handy,” Jen comments, feeling that that must be a very unique ability.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not always,” Nicky responds, remembering what it felt like to feel the spell his mama was in, and while Agatha is confused by what that means she notices the look on Rio’s face which tells here that there is a story there, one she suspects Nicky won’t want to talk about in front of everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     “If we’re going to take some time to rest, we should set up camp,” Lilia tells the others, not addressing what Nicky just said as she understands what it can be like to have an ability that causes sensations so intense that they can be a struggle to deal with.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like the sound of that,” Alice admits, feeling pretty exhausted, and considering everything that just happened Agatha knows what she should do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, I…” Agatha starts to say, honestly having no idea if she is going to apologize, or explain, but knowing she has to say something, even if she has no idea what.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay,” Alice says, surprising Agatha, giving her a reassuring look.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s, okay?” Jen asks, shocked. “She tried to kill you! How can you say that’s okay?”  Jen asks not being able to believe that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I was paying attention and realize that Agatha wasn’t in control,” Alice says, knowing that, as she felt that when Agatha started to siphon her magic. “So yeah, I’m saying it’s okay,” Alice reveals, making it clear she isn’t going to change her mind about this. “And I’m also saying thank you… Nicky,” Alice says, looking at him, knowing that because of him that she is still alive.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Nicky responds. “I’m just glad I was able to help someone on this damn road,” Nicky says, thinking about Sharon, and causing Agatha and Rio to exchange looks, it being perfectly clear that neither of them understand what that means, but are both extremely concerned about their son’s reaction. “Lilia’s right, we should get a camp set up,” Nicky says, wanting attention off him, and actually working pretty well together for once, the group gets started on setting up a campsite together.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     About ten minutes after Nicky suggested getting a fire set up he, Rio, Alice, Jen, and Lilia are sitting around the fire, talking a little, Rio sitting right next to her son, while Agatha is sitting alone. As she sees that Agatha has decided to sit alone rather than joining the group, Rio, who knows that while Agatha might make it seem like she wants to be alone actually wouldn’t want to be, knows what she has to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be back,” Rio says to her son in a quiet voice, only loud enough for him to hear. “And don’t for a second think we’re not going to talk about the fact that you hid you were hurt,” Rio tells her son, now knowing that he realized he was hurt long before he collapsed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I honestly hoping you didn’t remember that,” Nicky admits, though he isn’t overly surprised he didn’t get that lucky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a chance, Mi Conejtio,” Rio say. “We’re also going to talk about what you almost did,” Rio tells Nicky, his voice only loud enough for him to hear, before walking over to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mi Conejtio?” Jen asks. “Just how many languages do you speak?” Jen asks, still feeling confused about what language he spoke in to break the Sigil as it was clearly a language no one, other than Rio, and maybe Agatha, have ever heard before.
    </p>
<p>
     “A lot,” Nicky answers as he watches his mom sit down next to his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asks Agatha a few moments after she sits down next to her, when she realizes that Agatha isn’t going to acknowledge her presence.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” Agatha asks her, feeling that Rio should know better than asking that question.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’re probably feeling a whole lot right now that you don’t want to admit to, that you have a lot of questions,” Rio assumes, and Agatha silently curses Rio for knowing her so well. “If you want to ask them, I won’t lie,” Rio assures Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “You never do,” Agatha responds, knowing that, and while there are a lot of things, she wants to know she knows exactly what she wants to know first. “Where there any side effects of bringing him back?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “On him or me?” Rio asks, as there are multiple ways she could answer that particular question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Both,” Agatha answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “He was fine,” Rio assures Agatha. “Took some time to adjust to being back especially considering the changes in the world, but he was fine,” Rio assures Agatha, who visibly relax at that. “I was weakened for a while,” Rio explains, knowing there is no point in lying about that as Nicky already spilled the beans about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky said you slept,” Agatha says, knowing exactly how unusual that is.
    </p>
<p>
     “For a couple of days,” Rio admits, and Agatha is beyond shocked about that. “Turns out forcing your way through the veil, even for me, takes a lot of power, takes a lot out of you,” Rio explains, knowing it was worth it.
    </p>
<p>
     “But you still did it, you brought him back to us,” Agatha says, still amazed by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “As soon as I felt the universe become chaos, I knew I had to try, no matter what it took,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha says amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to thank me, Amour, I’m just sorry I couldn’t bring him back to you sooner,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Us,” Agatha corrects, reaching out and taking Rio’s hand. “He seems good, happy, you’ve done an amazing job,” Agatha says, as while she feels deep sorrow that she hasn’t been able to be with her son and Rio she is feeling some relief that he seems to be so okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve tried,” Rio admits. “But not a day went by where I didn’t wish you, the real you, were with us,” Rio assures Agatha, who realizes exactly what that means.
    </p>
<p>
     “You spent time with Agnes?” Agatha asks, realizing that she doesn’t know what that would have been liked as she only remembers the few days before the spell was broken, not before that.
    </p>
<p>
     “We live down the road,” Rio reveals, and while she realizes that makes sense Agatha is more surprised than she would admit as she knows Rio doesn’t tend to stay in the same place long, let alone three years. “Your reality reset every few days. So, we didn’t always know what to expect, but we did what we could to look after you, spend time with you,” Rio explains to Agatha, trying to explain in the most delicate way possible as she knows it’s an incredibly complicated situation and she doesn’t want Agatha to feel guilty about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I ever know you? Either of you?” Agatha asks, knowing it was sometimes painful to be around Nicky and just suspect who he was under the Sigil and because of that she can’t imagine what it was like for him to spend time with her if she never knew who he was when he did, while Rio debates the best way to answer as she doesn’t want to cause Agatha pain. “Rio?” Agatha asks, gently prodding when she realizes Rio isn’t answering.
    </p>
<p>
     “After we made a failed attempt to break the spell, you always knew I was someone from your past, more often than not someone you hated and was feeling a lot of anger towards,” Rio admits, not wanting to cause Agatha pain, but knowing she said she would be honest. “You never knew who Nicky was, but you did subconsciously look after him, and no matter what couldn’t handle hearing his name,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am so sorry,” Agatha tells Rio, having no idea how Rio would have handled experiencing, potentially years, of her hating her when they saw each other regularly, and feeling even more guilt as she realized the pain she must have caused Nicky by having no idea who he was.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not your fault,” Rio assures her, as she doesn’t want Agatha to blame herself more than she already is. “There’s only one person to blame,” Rio says, both Agatha and Rio knowing exactly who she is talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is she actually dead?” Agatha asks, needing to know that, and knowing that Rio is the one person who would know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but I don’t have much hope she’ll stay that way,” Rio admits, and as she does, she feels Agatha’s hand shiver in hers. “She’ll never hurt you again, never violate you again, I’m not gonna let that happen,” Rio says protectively, and Agatha smiles slightly, it being a long time since she has experienced Rio’s protectiveness, and realizing that it is something she has truly missed. “I’ll go toe to toe with her if I have to,” Rio assures Agatha, who knows that would be quiet the showdown.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just like you stood up to mother?” Agatha asks, that having meant everything to her, and Rio nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what she said wasn’t true, you were not born evil,” Rio assures Agatha, saying what she has told Agatha before, but also knowing that it will be difficult for Agatha to believe her as she always has.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did Nicky know about her before now?” Agatha asks, not addressing what Rio just said as that’s not something she can believe, no matter how many times Rio tries to convince her otherwise, and knowing that while she never told Nicky about his grandmother, she doesn’t know what Rio has told him over the last eight years.
    </p>
<p>
     “He knew a little, not a lot,” Rio admits. “We went to Salem when we were looking for you,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Salem? Why? You know I’d never go back there,” Agatha says, a little surprised that Rio would choose to go back there.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I wanted to show Nicky where he came from, where we met,” Rio admits. “We went to the Clearing,” Rio reveals, and as she does Agatha has a sinking suspicion about something, she just hopes she is wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please don’t tell me he could feel the magic used there, even after all this time,” Agatha says, knowing that if Rio and Nicky went to Salem while searching for her then that would have happened before he was thirteen, and if he could feel what happened then that would have been a lot for a kid to handle.
    </p>
<p>
     “He could, but that’s not all he could feel,” Rio reveals, and Agatha gives her an interested look, actually dreading what Rio is going to explain next. “Agatha, Nicky did inherit abilities from me,” Rio reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “What kind of abilities?” Agatha asks, glancing over to where Nicky is happily talking with Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “He can sense when a lot of people died in the same place, that’s what he felt when we went to the clearing,” Rio explains. “But he has another ability related to death,” Rio reveals, and Agatha gives her an interested look. “If he is in close proximity with someone and they are certainly going to die soon, it’s not clear exactly how soon, with no chance of survival, he can feel it. Usually, it requires him to touch a person, but being in close proximity can sometimes be enough,” Rio explains, feeling that it is important Agatha knows that because of how the Road can be, and as she does Agatha comes to a horrifying realization.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh god,” Agatha says, as pieces fall into place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rio asks concerned, knowing that it is bad that Nicky experiences that, but not completely understanding  Agatha’s reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mrs. Hart, the person who was on The Road before we called you, she died in the first task,” Agatha reveals, saying what Rio already knew. “I checked her body after the task, I saw sighs of magic… and Nicky was with her when she died,” Agatha tells Rio, who closes her eyes, as she realizes the same thing as Agatha. “Do you think he….” Agatha starts to ask, having no idea how to ask what she is thinking, but feeling that because Rio spent more time with their son than her, she would know if what she suspects is something he’s likely going to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think if Nicky knew she was going to die, that there was nothing that could change that, and she was in pain, then yes, he would help her find some peace,” Rio says, having no doubt that Nicky would have had no malice intentions, that he would have seen it as helping her, and as she speaks she and Agatha see Nicky get up, walk away from the others, and sit down on his own, leaning against a large tree stump. “You should talk to him,” Rio says, knowing Nicky well enough to know that he would be struggling with whatever happened and that this is the exact kind of thing Agatha would understand more than anyone else, including her.
    </p>
<p>
     “He doesn’t know me,” Agatha says, sadly. “You should talk to him,” Agatha says, wanting what is best for her son, and because of that she can admit that maybe what’s best for her son at the moment, isn’t her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, of course he knows you,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Knowing Agnes doesn’t count,” Agatha responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t mean Agnes,” Rio says “We talked about you every day. On every birthday Nicky wished to be with you, there was nothing he wanted more,” Rio assures her love. “I gave him the spell book you wrote, the one you gave to me for safe keeping, and long after I know he memorized every word of it I would still find that he fell asleep reading it because it made him feel connected to you,” Rio assures Agatha. “All he’s wanted since coming back is to spend time with you, he loves you, he is so much like you; you should talk to him,” Rio says, and Agatha isn’t sure if Nicky being like her, is a good thing. “Go, talk to him,” Rio encourages, as while she would like to talk to Nicky too, she knows that what both Nicky and Agatha need is to talk to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Agatha says, as she feels Rio encouragingly squeeze her hand and feeling extremely nervous Agatha gets up and heads towards where her son is.

      AN: IMPORTANT:
     </strong>
     I wrote all of this before 1x08 and 1x09. I am still trying to figure out what I felt about the episodes so I would love your opinions. Hope you like how this story is going to playout, I am proud of what I have written if that helps. Next chapter will be in 12ish hours.

     With every step Agatha takes towards her son, away from Rio, she finds herself feeling even more nervous, having no idea how this is going to go as she knows she doesn’t want to let him down more than she already has.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I join you?” Agatha asks Nicky, who looks up at her, and is seemingly glad to see her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” Nicky says, without hesitation, as all he wants is to spend time with his mama, and Agatha sits down next to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, I take it you’re not exactly missing power,” Agatha says, that being the first thing she can think to say, and she really hopes that wasn’t a mistake.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not so much,” Nicky says amused. “I didn’t take short cuts Mama, I studied, I did the work,” Nicky assures her, and as she hears Nicky once again call her Mama Agatha knows she is never going to stop being amazed by that. “Mom told me how you would say that knowledge can be more powerful than raw talent, so I’ve always made sure I never stopped learning,” Nicky assures Agatha, who is starting to see what Rio meant by Nicky being like her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m really glad to hear that,” Agatha says proudly. “Mom said you had the spell book I wrote,” Agatha says to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes! That book is amazing! The way you understand magic, it gave me so much to consider,” Nicky tells his mama, clearly excited to talk about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad I could help,” Agatha tells her son, while it doesn’t make up for not being able to be with him, she is glad that she was able to give him some lessons, in a sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did, you really did, Mama,” Nicky tells her. “I know you said I had no reason to feel guilty about not breaking the spell sooner, but I am,” Nicky tells his mama. “I felt the spell. I felt how it strangled you, violated you, how it clawed it’s way into every part of you, and I hate that I wasn’t able to help you sooner, I am sorry Mama,” Nicky says, needing to say that even though she told him not to feel guilty.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, it’s okay,” Agatha assures him, though she is trying not to think about what she knows it felt like, and after a moment of hesitation she puts her arm around him. “This wasn’t just any spell, it was cast by the Scarlet Witch, the fact that you managed to figure out how to break it is incredible,” Agatha says, and she knows that some point they will talk a little more about how he did that, but not right now. “It’s complicated magic, you have no reason to feel anything but pride about what you did. I know that’s how I feel,” Agatha assures her son. “I’m so proud of you, Nicky, you have no reason to feel guilty,” Agatha assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you, Mama,” Nicky tells his mother, not sure if he can believe her words, as he snuggles into her side a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Agatha assures him, as she leans down and kisses the top of his head. “Nicky, were you about to blast me when I was siphoning form Alice?” Agatha asks her son, as she needs to know how close she came to losing him before she even knew he was actually himself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky answers. “I know mom told me to never do that, but I wanted to help,” Nicky tells his mama, and Agatha is glad that Rio at least stressed how important it is not to blast her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I appreciate that, I do, but Nicholas no matter what you can never blast me with your magic,” Agatha tells him. “Okay, no matter what, you cannot do that,” Agatha says, needing to stress that. “Promise me you won’t ever do that,” Agatha almost begs.
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise,” Nicky responds, only doing so because of the tone of voice his mother used, after a moment of hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha says, feeling a little bit better about that, but also knowing they will have to have that conversation again at some point and the two of them drift into silence as they sit together.
    </p>
<p>
     As they sit together in comfortable silence both Agatha and Nicky just embrace the feeling of being together again, something they have both wanted for a very long time, as they watch Rio rejoin the others. While she loves just sitting comfortably with her son Agatha knows there is another conversation, even if it is painful, that she needs to have with her son for his own good.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, what happened to Sharon?” Agatha asks her son in a gentle voice as she feels him tense, which tells her everything about what they are going to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did Mom tell you?” Nicky asks, assuming that for Agatha to ask the question she knows more than just what she noticed about the body.
    </p>
<p>
     “She told me that you can tell when a lot of people have died in the same place, and that you can tell when someone is certainly going to die, when there is nothing that can save them,” Agatha tells her son, who avoids looking at his mama. “Nicky, it’s okay, whatever happened,” Agatha assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had a bad feeling about Sharon coming with us since she came into the basement,” Nicky admits. “At first I thought it was just because she was coming and not mom,” Nicky admits, and Agatha realises that Nicky’s behaviour in relation to who would be the Green Witch on the Road makes more sense. “But then we got into the first trial, and I knew what I was feeling, but I tried to ignore it, until I touched her hand when it tried to stop her drink more wine and I knew for sure,” Nicky explains to his mama. “She was going to die, and nothing could change that,” Nicky admits, sounding upset. “I checked the rest of you and was able to tell that you’d be okay, so I didn’t say anything because I knew we had to focus on completing the trial,” Nicky explains to his mama, still not sure if he made the right decision. “When she came out of the trial, she was alive, but I knew that she was going to die within a few minutes, that nothing could change that, but that she was going to be in a lot of pain for those few minutes,” Nicky explains to his mama. “I did my best to comfort her, and then I used my magic to speed up her fate, to take away her pain,” Nicky explains, tears coming to his eyes. “Are you disappointed in me? Are you ashamed?” Nicky asks his mama, as he never wants that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Never,” Agatha assures her son. “Sounds like you were trying to do a noble thing, that you took away her pain,” Agatha tells her son, realising that while he may have done a bad thing, he did it for the right reason. “Nicky, you never have to be worried about telling me something, never have to be worried about my reaction, because I’ve guaranteed I’ve done something worse,” Agatha assures her son. “I’ll never be disappointed in you, I’ll never be ashamed,” Agatha assures her son, knowing that she will never make him feel the way her mother made her feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a little ashamed,” Nicky admits. “I know I helped her, that if I didn’t, she would have had a few minutes of extreme pain, and I took it away, but it still doesn’t feel good,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because you’re a good person,” Agatha tells her son. “You used your magic for a good reason, took away someone’s pain, that’s incredible,” Agatha tells her son, not wanting him to feel shame or guilt about his magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t feel rather incredible,” Nicky admits, knowing that what he is mostly feeling at the moment is how he hates both his abilities sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Agatha says as she certainly understands that. “I know it doesn’t help a lot with what happened to Sharon, but Nicky, you also saved Alice; she’s alive because of you,” Agatha tells her son, wanting him to focus on the good things, rather than the bad things, that he was able to do, and knowing she is incredibly thankful that her son was able to keep her from killing someone else.
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew she wasn’t a certainty to die, which meant there was hope,” Nicky tells his mama. “I knew what I had to do, even though it broke the promise I made mom,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “What promise was that?” Agatha asks her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “That I wouldn’t break the Sigil,” Nicky explains. “It was going to break on its own at the end of the Road, but mom made a way for me to break it if needed; there was so many times I was tempted to break it sooner,” Nicky admits. “My plan never involved a Sigil, Mom insisted on that,” Nicky admits, and hearing that Agatha knows there is a conversation that they need to have, but that Rio need to be involved in this particular conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see,” Agatha says, feeling that she needs to know exactly what Rio and Nicky’s plan is, and that’s not a conversation to have with only Nicky. “Rio,” Agatha calls, and Rio excuses herself form the others and walks over.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?” Rio asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “You decided to put the Sigil in place?” Agatha asks, wanting to know exactly why Rio decided it was necessary to make it so they both had no idea who Nicky was.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did,” Rio confirms,
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because if I hadn’t, you’d never agree to go down The Road,” Rio tells Agatha, as she sits down with Agatha and Nicky. “And we need to get to the end of the Road,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Agatha asks, as that’s the one piece of the puzzle that is not fitting for her, but to her surprise it’s not Rio who answers, it’s Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “In the last three years we’ve seen how the spell you were under adapts, I wasn’t sure if breaking the spell would be permanent,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you wanted to go down the road to make sure I was permanently free from her control,” Agatha says, not sure how to feel about that, as she is terrified of going back under the control of Wanda’s spell, but she is also incredibly guilty that Nicky would put himself in incredible danger because of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want my family to be together as our real selves,” Nicky explains to his mother, who smiles at that and once again kisses his head, but then she notices the look on Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not your reason,” Agatha realises, knowing that because she knows Rio and knows what the look means.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do want us together, more than anything,” Rio assures Agatha, who believes her. “The Salem Seven has come after Nicky before, and I was barely able to get us away from them,” Rio reveals, and Agatha shivers at that because she knows how bad that is, and she also plans to ask Rio more about that when Nicky isn’t around as she doesn’t want to bring up painful memories for him. “I’m limited on what I can do,” Rio admits, saying what both Agatha and Nicky know.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I’m not,” Agatha realises. “You wanted me to get my magic back,” Agatha realises, realising that considering everything, that makes sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is the only way to make sure you and Nicky would be okay,” Rio explains. “Wanda’s spell caused a lot of magical interference in Westview, made it incredibly hard for you and Nicky to be found, which is why we were safe living there for three years, but as soon as I got word that the Salem Seven were getting closer, I knew it was only a matter of time before they attacked,” Rio explains to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you weren’t sure you could protect us,” Agatha realises, knowing that while Rio is all powerful in a lot of ways, she is limited in the ways she can fight the living, and she cannot, ever, kill.
    </p>
<p>
     “What I did to get away from the Salem Seven the first time they found us took almost everything out of me, I knew I wouldn’t be able to do it a second time,” Rio admits, making Agatha curious about just what she did. “Nicky figured out a way to break the spell on you about the same time I found out the Seven were coming after you both,” Rio explains. “I hated the idea of the Sigil, hated that I was taking away time you and Nicky could spend time together, but I didn’t know another way to protect Nicky, and make sure you’d go down The Road, which is the only way for you to get your magic back,” Rio explains, and because she has known Rio so well Agatha knows she is feeling guilty about that, even though she is trying to hide it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I would have had the strength to make that decision,” Agatha admits, feeling that she may not have been able to, that she would have made a selfish choice. “You knew what you were giving up,” Agatha says, as there is no question that Rio would know about her own memory being erased if she cast the Sigil.
    </p>
<p>
     “I needed to believe I would remember again,” Rio admits, as that’s what gave her the courage to cast the Sigil, that she would get her memories back.
    </p>
<p>
     “And yet you made me promise not to break the Sigil,” Nicky reminds his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which you did anyway,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I agreed not to break it unless there was an emergency, I thought what happened qualified,” Nicky admits, and Agatha is very glad that he thought that. “Besides you’re lucky I didn’t break it sooner with the way you two traumatised me,” Nicky tells his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Traumatized?” Rio asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you talking about?” Agatha asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “That fight you had at the house… I’m going to be traumatized for life,” Nicky tells his parents, both of whom exchange fond looks, and while Rio grins, Agatha blushes slightly, it being clear to Nicky that neither consider that fight a bad thing, in fact, unknown to him they both considered that to be foreplay. “Ew gross,” Nicky says, looking between his parents. “I know all I’ve wanted is for my moms to be back together, but I don’t need to see it,” Nicky tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t see anything,” Agatha tells her son, knowing that fight was pretty tame for them, and she is even more glad that he didn’t come looking for them before the last task, and hearing that Nicky decides he really doesn’t want to know what his mama would consider something.
    </p>
<p>
     “And now you know how I feel when Eddie is around, I didn’t need to see that either,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eddie? Is that the boyfriend?” Agatha asks, remembering what Nicky said when they were driving together, becoming very interested in that, wanting to be caught up on what she has missed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Nicky says happily. “Are you going to threaten him too?” Nicky asks worried as Eddie being threatened by one of his moms was bad enough, no he is worried about what his other mother is going to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “You threatened him?” Agatha asks, looking at Rio, not at all surprised by that, and a little amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not explicitly,” Rio says with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     “You played with your knife all throughout the first dinner we had together!” Nicky reminds his mom, causing Agatha to laugh, as she can imagine exactly what Rio would have looked like doing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s something I always do, not my fault he got scared by it,” Rio responds, causing Nicky to roll his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you happy, Nicky?” Agatha asks her son, wanting to know that. “Does he treat you well?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I am, he does,” Nicky assures his mother. “I can’t wait for you to meet him,” Nicky tells his mother, as it is something he has really wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     “I look forward to it too,” Agatha responds, already having a few ideas about what she is going to do during that meeting, something which Rio realises from the look on her face, and the three of them drift into comfortable silence as they sit together, getting to spend time together, as themselves, for the first time in over a century.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Rio, Agatha, and Nicky are talking, and spending time together Lilia, Alice and Jen are sitting around the fire, the three of them occasionally glancing over to where the Vidal-Harkness family are.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think the story there is?” Alice, who is feeling a little stronger, asks the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “Complicated,” Jen answers. “I knew Agatha had a son, but I’m going to assume everything else I have heard isn’t true,” Jen admits, very much doubting what she previously believed after everything she has seen on the Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’ve been apart for a long time,” Lilia admits. “This reunion is a miracle,” Lilia says, being able to tell that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely seems like it,” Alice admits, as she knows it’s a miracle, she is still alive, and she has Nicky to thank for that.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “So, you’re doing well in school?” Agatha asks her son, as he and Rio are telling her various things about their lives, while the details may see mundane to others, to her they are incredible, and she is beyond thrilled to learn about them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, not too bad, I actually enjoy it,” Nicky admits, and as he does, he notices the look on Rio’s face. “You don’t have to be so smug about it,” Nicky tells Rio, and Agatha realises there is a story there.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t say anything,” Rio tells her son, but the look on her face says so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t have to, I know that look,” Nicky tells his mother. “You were right, I was wrong, happy?” Nicky asks his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thrilled,” Rio responds, with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel like I’m missing something,” Agatha realises, feeling extremely curious and also feeling a little sad that she doesn’t already know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky wasn’t a big fan of going to school when I first told him that he was going to be going,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a nice way of saying I sent Mom flying across the room and made it so she couldn’t get up for a while,” Nicky explains, still feeling guilty about that, and Agatha realises that, considering who Rio is, that would have taken some truly powerful magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’ve told you that it’s okay, that you had no reason to feel guilty for reacting like that,” Rio assures her son, and Agatha is thrilled to hear that as she knows that it means Rio has been doing her best to make sure Nicky doesn’t feel guilty about his magic, something they both never wanted him to feel.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom’s right, Nicky,” Agatha tells her son. “Sometimes we can’t control our magic, and we do things we don’t expect, never feel guilty for that,” Agatha tells her son, wanting his experience to be different from hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’m going to go for a walk,” Nicky says, making it clear he doesn’t want to talk about it, as he stands up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky…” Rio starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m okay, I won’t go far, I’ll stay on The Road,” Nicky assures his mothers, but before they can stop him, he walks away, causing both his mothers to watch him go with worried looks on their faces.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does he feel guilty about his magic?” Agatha asks Rio worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “He loves magic, and he loves learning about it, but yes, I do think he has a level of guilt about it, especially when it comes to his sensing abilities,” Rio admits. “Like I said, he’s a lot like you,” Rio says, knowing that she is the only person who knows just how much guilt Agatha carries around with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a part of me I never wanted him to inherit,” Agatha admits, feeling worried about her son.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After walking away from his mothers Nicky heads to a nearby cleaning where there is a swamp. While he appreciates how his mothers are trying to make him feel better about everything the truth is he just feels worse, he feels guiltier. Closing his eyes Nicky allows himself to feel the feeling of the ground beneath him, of the wind rustling on his face, but as he feels everything Nicky quickly opens his eyes as he feels something incredibly wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “You,” Nicky says, horrified, as he sees the ghost of Evanora Harkness standing before him. “How?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t end the session on goodbye,” Evanora says, and Nicky curses the mistake, having no idea what Evanora could want, but knowing that it cannot be anything good, Nicky causes magic to dance around his hand, ready to use it to blast her, having no idea if it will work on a ghost, but knowing he needs to protect himself. “You’re evil, just like your mother,” Evanora tells Nicky, and before he can do anything she flies into him, possessing him, and she uses that control to throw Nicky into the swamp, causing him to sink below the Road, his hoddie being left on the bank as the only sign of him.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I am glad that I am not the only one who has issues with the final two episodes…. Hope you like what’s to come with this story… I think you will. (I hope)
    </p>
<p>
     ALSO, this story is 37 chapters. Do you want me to keep updating every twelve hours, or do you want me more often. Let me know.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After watching Nicky walk away both Agatha and Rio want to go after him, but they can both appreciate that he would need some time, so rather than going after him they have re-joined the others around the fire.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something’s wrong,” Rio suddenly says, interrupting what Jen was saying, something she wasn’t even listening to. “Nicky knows we would worry, he wouldn’t stay away for this long,” Rio says, clearly concerned, and if her words weren’t enough to concern Agatha Rio’s tone of voice would be more than enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “He can’t have gone far,” Jen says, trying to be reassuring. “I’m sure there is nothing to worry about,” Jen says, trying to help but to both Agatha and Rio it just feels like she is being dismissive.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have you been on the same road as us?” Agatha asks annoyed as she stands up. “There’s every reason to be worried,” Agatha says, sounding annoyed wit Jen, but also being incredibly concerned about her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re right, we’ll help look,” Alice says, standing up. “We’ll find him,” Alice says, trying to be reassuring.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says as Lilia stands up too. “Call out if you find him,” Rio says, and everyone, even Jen, head in different directions to search for Nicky, both Agatha and Rio feeling absolutely terrified about what has happened to their son, Agatha knowing that now she has gotten him back she cannot lose him again.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The second the ghost of Evanora Harkness flies into him all Nicky feels is hate, and anger, the kind of hate and anger he never wanted to feel, but then he feels pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ouch,” Nicky says annoyed, as he realises, he has hit the ground. “That was painful,” Nicky says, as he gets to his feet. While he is feeling sore because he fell, but he also feels pain in his heart knowing that his mama grew up around the kind of hate and anger he just got a small taste off.
    </p>
<p>
     As he gets to his feet Nicky looks around and as he does, he realises two things, the first is that he is obviously under The Road, and the second is that he is surrounded by the Salem Seven. “Oh great,” Nicky mutters, and having no idea if it will work Nicky uses his magic to levitate and tries to exit the tunnels the same way he came, but he quickly realises that is impossible, and he falls back to the ground. “Okay, running it is,” Nicky says and even though he knows it likely won’t do much Nicky starts to run, going in the direction that tells him there is only one Salem Seven member breaking.
    </p>
<p>
     As gets closer Nicky quickly sends a blast at the Salem seven member, knocking them over, before using his magic, in the same way he saw his mom use at his mama’s house, to enhance his jump and catapult over the Salem seven member.
    </p>
<p>
     Once he is over the member of the seven Nicky runs down the tunnel that is now clear and without pausing for a second, he uses his magic to cave in the tunnel behind him, trying to prevent the Seven from following, having only one thing on his mind, surviving long enough to get back to his moms.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Nicky!” Agatha yells, feeling absolutely terrified that she is going to lose him again, as she hurries down The Road, looking for him.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, you can care about something other than yourself,” A voice that has haunted her as long as she has been alive says, and Agatha turns to see her mother’s ghost.
    </p>
<p>
     “You,” Agatha says furiously. “What did you do?” Agatha asks angrily, as for the first time in her life she doesn’t feel like the scared little kid her mother always made her feel like, rather she just feels worried about her son, and determined to find out what happened to him, no matter what it takes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly what I should have done to you,” Evanora says, causing Agatha’s blood to run cold, as she knows exactly what her mother meant by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, he’s not dead, he can’t be,” Agatha says, needing to believe that.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s already died once,” Evanora says before ‘flying’ away, feeling very satisfied with the pain she just caused her daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, he can’t be,” Agatha repeats, needing to believe that, needing to believe that she hasn’t already lost her son before getting a chance to really know him, and as she tries to convince herself that Nicky isn’t gone, she notices something.
    </p>
<p>
     Hurrying across the clearing Agatha sees what she knows to be Nicky’s hoddie, which she picks up, but no other sign of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “RIO!” Agatha yells, knowing that Rio is the only one who will be able to tell if Evanora was telling the truth. “NICKY!” Agatha yells, and as she does Rio, Jen, Lilia and Alice hurry into the clearing where Agatha is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Rio asks, hurrying towards her, seeing what Agatha is holding.
    </p>
<p>
     “She says he’s gone,” Agatha says, the heartbreak she is feeling clear in her voice. “Was she telling the truth?” Agatha asks, and while Rio has no idea who ‘she’ is she knows it doesn’t matter, all that matters is their son.
    </p>
<p>
     Closing her eyes Rio focuses, and just for a second Agatha, Lilia, Jen and Alice see her Lady Death, persona flicker through, something which confuses everyone but Agatha, and within seconds she has her answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s alive,” Rio says, relief clear in her voice as the relief she is feeling is reflected on Agatha’s face. “But I can’t tell where he is,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s alive?” Agatha asks, needing to once again hear Rio say it.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s alive,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to find him,” Agatha says, feeling prepared to do whatever she has to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can find him,” Rio tells Agatha. “You and Nicky are connected in a way I’m not,” Rio says, feeling very glad about that at this current moment. “He can sense you, can find you, which means you’ll be able to find him,” Rio tells Agatha, having complete faith in Agatha and her ability to find their son, even without her ‘active’ magic.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never done that before,” Agatha admits, feeling worried that she is gong to let her son down, again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Since when has that ever stopped you before?” Rio asks, as in all the years she has known Agatha she has continuously done things she has never done before, and Agatha smiles slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good point,” Agatha says, closing her eyes and focusing on nothing else but her son, and after a few moments she realises something. “He’s that way,” Agatha says, pointing in the direction where she ‘feel’s’ Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then that’s the way we’re going,” Rio says, completely trusting Agatha, and once she does Agatha turns to Lilia, Alice and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you want to stay, or continue on without us, that’s your choice, but we’re going to find our son,” Agatha says, knowing that going on a search for Nicky isn’t what they signed up for.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s no way we’d continue on without you,” Alice tells Agatha. “We’ll help you get him back,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “We share burdens remember,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s just a kid, I wouldn’t leave him,” Jen says, stressing the ‘I’, and making it clear that she isn’t doing this for Agatha, she is doing this for Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha says, everyone else knowing just how much of a big deal it is that Agatha is actually thanking him. “Let’s move,” Agatha says, and not allowing time for the others to dwell on what she said Agatha starts to walk in the direction she knows she will find her son, the others following behind; though in Rio’s case she hurries forward so she is walking side by side with Agatha.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Being sure that his mothers have realised that he is missing and that they are looking for him, Nicky who has no idea where he is going, is continuing to walk through the tunnels beneath The Road. As he can’t ‘feel’ the Salem Seven anymore Nicky is no longer running but is instead walking.
    </p>
<p>
     Due to the fact that he is trying to use his abilities to give him as much warning about what is coming as possible as he approaches a corner Nicky realises exactly what he is going to find when he rounds it. As he knows what he is going to face Nicky pulls the knife his mother gave him as he approaches the corner as while he isn’t sure it will do anything he figures, that considering who’s knife it is, it is his best option.
    </p>
<p>
     “Should have known you weren’t done with me,” Nicky says as he rounds the corner and sees Evanora’s ghost.
    </p>
<p>
     “You and your mother are stains on my family!” Evanora tells Nicky. “I am ashamed that you share my blood! I will not rest until you’ve been removed,” Evanora tells Nicky, who rolls his eyes at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, do you realise how much of a hypocrite you’re being?” Nicky asks his grandmother, not at all phased about his grandmothers’ words as she doesn’t matter to him. “From the moment Mama was born you decided who she was. You decided that because she wasn’t the same as you imagined she would be she was evil,” Nicky tells Evanora. “Did ever even try to see who she really was?” Nicky asks his grandmother, as he very much doubts it, but wants to know what she is going to say to that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t have to,” Evanora says. “She was a devil child, stole the magic of others! Corrupted other girls!” Evanora exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     “She couldn’t control it! she still can’t because you didn’t teach her how to!” Nicky exclaims, feeling very protective of his mother. “You were her mother, the head of her coven! You had a responsibility. You were meant to teach her, not give up on her!” Nicky exclaims, tightening the hold on his knife, feeling angry, but trying really hard not to lose control.
    </p>
<p>
     “I tried to teach her to be righteous, tried to teach her to be proper! To not be unnatural! But she never learnt, no matter what lessons she received,” Evanora says, and because he can read between the lines of what Evanora is saying Nicky feels sick; not realising that the reality of what his mama went through is actually worse than he is imagining.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s it isn’t it?” Nicky asks, taking a step towards Evanora, feeling braver. “Your biggest problem with mama isn’t that she can take others magic, it’s not that she can’t control her abilities,” Nicky says. “Your biggest problem is that she’s a lesbian,” Nicky says to his grandmother, feeling horrified by her, and feeling incredibly sorry for his mama, and the disgusted look on Evanora’s face is enough to confirm what he is thinking. “You never accepted her at all,” Nicky realises, having no idea what that would have been like for his mama to grow up like that as all he has never experienced anything other than supportive moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s unnatural, it makes her an abomination; that can never be acceptable,” Evanora says, her voice full of disgust and hate.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s where you’re wrong,” Nicky says angrily. “A parent is meant to love and support their child, always. By not doing that you’re the unnatural one, you’re the evil one,” Nicky says, taking a step closer to her, standing tall, showing that he is not afraid of her. “And you know what, despite everything you did, all the hurt you cased, as much as you tried to make Mama believe she would never be loved; she is,” Nicky says. “Mom found her, they found each other, and they fell in the love, the truest love you could never understand, and because of that love they had me,” Nicky tells his grandmother. “And you know what else? Even though she never had an example to use all I’ve ever known from mama is acceptance, love and support; she couldn’t be further from what you tried to make her be,” Nicky admits. “You’ve may have hurt Mama in the past but you’re never going to hurt her again, Mom and I won’t let you, because that’s what actual family does; protect each other,” Nicky says, feeling his magic crackling within him.
    </p>
<p>
     “You speak like you have a choice… you don’t,” Evanora says, starting to fly towards Nicky, it being perfectly clear that she is going to possess him again, and as she flies towards him Nicky knows exactly what to do. Having no idea if it is going to work once his grandmother is close enough Nicky thrusts his arm out and stabs the ghost with the knife that belongs to death.
    </p>
<p>
     For a second it is almost like the knife did nothing, but then Nicky’s magic encircles the blade, and it spreads from the knife all through Evanora causing her to scream in excruciating pain before, with a force so strong that it knocks Nicky off his feet, Evanora is destroyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, that hurt,” Nicky says, feeling rather dizzy, and as he still has the knife in his hand Nicky can feel it’s power, he can feel that what he did was only possible because he, the son of Lady Death and one of the most powerful witches to ever exist, wielded that specific blade. “That was for you, mama,” Nicky mutters, feeling proud that he is going to be able to tell his mama that her mother will never hurt her again, and as he sits up, he realises that he has landed on something. Feeling curious Nicky digs around the dirt and finds his spell book. “Huh,” Nicky says as he holds the object, feeling glad to have it again, but also feeling a little drained because of everything that just happened.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea what their son is currently experiencing Rio and Agatha are still walking with the rest of the coven, walking towards where, according to the connection Agatha shares with their son, they will find, Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s his defensive magic?” Agatha asks Rio, wanting to know if Nicky will be able to defend himself if he comes face to face with the Salem Seven.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty good,” Rio assures Agatha, who is relieved about that. “He also has one of my knifes,” Rio reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “You taught him to use your knife?” Agatha asks, causing the others to exchange looks as while Rio teaching Nicky how to use her knife is clearly something significant, they don’t know why.
    </p>
<p>
     “When he was ten,” Rio says, and from the look on Agatha’s face Rio is sure she isn’t completely happy about that. “I couldn’t always be with him, I wanted to make sure he had as many ways to protect himself as possible,” Rio admits, and as she does the disapproval on Agatha’s face slips away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seems like it was a good thing you did,” Agatha admits, giving Rio a look which means ‘it’s okay,’ and the two of them drift into silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, Nicky, he’s both of your son?” Jen asks, breaking the silence, causing Alice to give her a ‘are you seriously asking that right now,’, look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Agatha and Rio say together.
    </p>
<p>
     “In every way,” Agatha adds, wanting to make that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you were separated?” Lilia asks in a gentle voice, trying to understand a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     “For too long,” Agatha says, and once she does Rio reaches out and takes her hand, giving it a supportive squeeze and as they see the actions of the pair Lilia, Jen, and Alice exchange looks, and while they are incredibly curious about what that means they also realise that it’s not the time to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     As she is holding Rio’s hand Agatha feels her suddenly tense, and let out a small gaps,
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?” Agatha asks concerned, dreading what she is going to say as she knows it’s not often Rio reacts like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just felt something, something I’ve never felt before,” Rio admits, trying to make sense of what she just felt. “An incredible release of power, caused a ripple,” Rio says, feeling confused about what could have caused that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was Nicky,” Agatha says, knowing that their son being the reason Rio is feeling is the only thing that makes sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Rio admits, feeling that that makes sense. “But whatever he did… I’ve never felt that before,” Rio admits, and as she does Agatha has a suspicion as deep inside, she feels like a weight has been lifted.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mothers ghost escaped the trial,” Agatha reveals, causing Rio to give her a surprised look. “Do you think he somehow managed to destroy her?” Agatha asks, as that is the only thing that makes sense to her, the only thing that would fit with what she is currently feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Rio admits. “If any being was capable of destroying ghosts it would make sense to be him… but I just don’t know,” Rio admits, trying to make sense of everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you think the son of witches could destroy a ghost?” Jen asks, and as she does Lilia comes to a realisation.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not a witch,” Lilia says to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Technically I’m the first Green Witch,” Rio admits. “But these days I’m better known as Lady Death,” Rio reveals, and she isn’t at all surprised when Lilia, Alice, and Jen take a step back from her, it being perfectly clear they are all shocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re dating death!” Jen exclaims, giving Agatha a shocked look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Married to Death actually,” Agatha corrects, sounding rather proud and she is amused by the shocked look on Jen’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s so cool,” Alice says, causing both Agatha and Rio to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your son has a long path ahead of him, will face challenges no one else has faced, experience profound changes, is capable of thing you can’t imagine, he will need more support than you realise,” Lilia says, in her ‘wispy’ tone of voice which tells the others that she is making a prediction.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s got it, no matter what,” Agatha says and Rio nods in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Got what?” Lilia asks confused, and Rio turns to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry about it, but thank you,” Rio tells Lilia who feels even more confused, and as she turns around she realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Rio says annoyed, as there is what looks like a cabin in the distance which tells her they will find another trial there. “We do not have time for this,” Rio says, as all she wants is to get to her son, not go through a trial that is clearly hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s inside,” Agatha tells Rio, who turns to look at her, sounding as annoyed as Rio. “Nicky’s inside the trial,” Agatha reveals, knowing that without a doubt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course he is,” Rio realises, knowing that she should have seen this coming. “Down the rabbit hole I go then,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not alone,” Agatha says, squeezing Rio’s hand and the two of them walk towards the ‘Cabin’ and even though they are still shocked by everything that was revealed in the past few minutes, Lilia, Jen, and Alice follow behind and together they enter the trial, all prepared to face whatever is to come as a coven.

     Chapter 28:

<p>
<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     I have decided to update more frequently. My goal is going to be to update two or three chapters in a day. ALSO, I am definitely going to keep writing Agathario and have a list of stories I want to write, so if there is anything you want to see please leave in a comment and I will add it to my list, and see if I feel inspired to write it.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The second they enter the 'cabin' are once again changed to fit the trial as all five of them find themselves in what seems to be a clearing that seems strikingly familiar to both Agatha and Rio, while the entire group have been changed into outfits fitting of the late 1600s.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm guessing this has some significance for the two of you," Jen comments, assuming that not only because it is clearly Rio's trial, but because of the looks on both Agatha and Rio's faces.
    </p>
<p>
     "You could say that," Agatha says, knowing that the 'trial' has become a place that is the place where she had both one of the worst moments in her life, but also one of her best, both moments happening within minutes of each other, and as she says that a raven files and lands on a nearby log with a parchment around it's leg.
    </p>
<p>
     "I assume that's for me," Rio assumes, as that is what makes the most sense.
    </p>
<p>
     "It would be the start of the trial," Jen tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course," Rio says, walking over to the bird and taking the piece of parchment. As she knows that whatever the note says effects everyone else just as much as her Rio opens it and reads the message out loud:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "The Road welcomes you to the penultimate trial. You have learned secrets of the past but now you need to understand how the past affects you. As the first Green Witch, a cosmic being, you need to be grounded, at peace within yourself, but you are not. You have the job of maintaining harmony within the universe, but you cannot do that if you don't have inner harmony. A journey through your past to find what you are missing awaits, but be warned, the past has a way of coming back with a vengeance," Rio reads, and as she finishes the note, she looks at Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Well, that sounds like it's going to be fun," Agatha says sarcastically, though she cannot help but be considered about how the note described Rio's current state.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah," Rio says, really not looking forward to this. "Can you tell where Nicky is?" Rio asks Agatha, wanting to focus on him, and Agatha shakes her head in response.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, I can just tell he is here," Agatha admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "Great," Rio says annoyed, as that doesn't help, and right now she would much rather find her son than compete a trial. "So, I guess we should figure out what way to go," Rio comments, looking around, and seeing there is no exit, but several paths that come off the clearing.
    </p>
<p>
     "If this location is connected to you past then you know where each path will lead too," Lilia points out.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, that path led to town," Rio says, pointing to one of the paths that is coming off the clearing. "The path leads to your mothers house," Rio says, pointing to another path as she looks at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Which we are definitely not going down," Agatha says, having no intention of going back there, even if it is a protected simulation, and Rio has to agree with her about that.
    </p>
<p>
     "What about that path?" Jen asks, pointing to the one that Rio hasn't explained.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's the one we went down the first time we left this clearing together," Rio says, looking at Agatha as she speaks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sounds like the perfect place to start if the trial is about learning how the past affects you," Alice admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, I guess it would be," Rio admits, feeling very nervous, and Agatha once again takes her hand, wanting to show Rio that no matter what may have happened between them in the past they are okay now, that she isn't alone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Whatever it is, you can face it, we can face it," Agatha assures Rio, and feeling comforted Rio nods.
    </p>
<p>
     Taking strength and comfort from Agatha Rio starts to walk down the path they walked all those years ago, and as they walk down the path, they find an arch made of the same kind of flowers Rio gave Agatha when she showed up on the road. Exchanging one more look with Agatha Rio, with Agatha by her side, and the rest of the coven walking behind, walks through the arch.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as they walk through the arch the group find themselves in a location that is just as significant to Rio and Agatha as the clearing, they were just in.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio mutters, horror in her voice, looking around and seeing that they have been transported to the home where she and Agatha lived for the few months that proceeded Nicky dying.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      Rio? Is that you?"
     </em>
     Agatha's voice says, coming from a partially open door, both present Agatha and Rio knowing exactly what they will find throughout the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't want to go in there," Rio says, trying to move back form the door, falling backwards as she is trying so hard to get away from the door, as even though Nicky has returned to them it doesn't take away the pain, grief, and anger that his death caused.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, I know Mi Amour," Agatha says, walking over to her. "I don't want to either," Agatha admits, as she squats down on the ground. "But we have to," Agatha reminds Rio, reaching out and pushing Rio's hair out of her face. "Sweetheart, what we're going to see is our past, and as hard as it's going to be, you need to remember that our son, our Nicky, is alive; you brought him back to us," Agatha reminds her. "We've got to go through this to get to him," Agatha reminds her, trying to get Rio to focus on what they need to do rather than what they are going to experience.
    </p>
<p>
     "I hate this," Rio says to Agatha in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Me too," Agatha responds, and Rio leans forward and hugs Agatha. For a few moments Agatha returns the hug, holding her tightly, and kissing her check, until they finally break apart. "We can do this," Agatha tells Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can do this," Rio responds, and before she can think better of what she is going to do Rio stands up, and once Agatha once again takes her hand the two of them head through the partially open door, and the others, who have no idea what they are going to find, follow behind.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      As soon as the group walk through the door, they see Agatha, clearly a little younger, sitting on a bed, holding Nicky when he was on seven, and it is clear to everyone that he isn't well.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's me, I'm here," Rio, who looks exactly the same, hurries into the room, as unknown to everyone, except for the version of her watching on, she was trying to find a way to prevent what she knew was about to happen.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mommy," Nicky says, and he barely gets the word out before he starts gasping, and coughing.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Pneumonia?" Jen asks, as that's what it seems like to her, and considering what time period it appears to be she can guess what's about to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah," Agatha confirms, fighting back her reaction, as she wants to be strong for Rio, even if she feels her own heart break.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's okay, Sweetheart, we're right here," Agatha assured her son. "You're going to be okay," Agatha said, then she noticed the look on Rio's face. "Don't," Agatha said to Rio, who looked heartbroken.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Nicky, Mi Conejito," Rio said, as she reached out and took her son's hand. "Mama and I love you so much," Rio said, as Nicky continued to gasp, it was perfectly clear he struggled for every strangled breath. "You can let go, it's okay," Rio said, as she could tell how much her son was suffering, and she didn't want that for him.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "No! stop! No!" Agatha yelled, as she clung to her son. "Hold on, Nicky, please, just hold on," Agatha begged.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mama?" Nicky asked confused.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As they both know what is coming both Agatha and Rio close their eyes, not wanting to see what is about to happen again, while the rest of the coven just watch in silent, very much feeling like they are intruding, but also feeling that it explained so much about the two women.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you, I love you so much," Agatha told her son, as she held him, and as does she felt the instant he stopped breathing. "Nicky?" Agatha asked her son, her voice breaking. "Nicky?" Agatha asked again, desperate for him to respond.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha…" Rio stared to say, and as she did Agatha turned to look at her with a look of pure fury on her face, her purple magic clearly crackling behind her eyes.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Bring him back!" Agatha exclaimed.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I can't," Rio said.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're death! You can do anything!" Agatha told her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Not this," Rio said, Agatha being so caught up in her own grief that she did not realise that every word was causing Rio pain. "He's…." Rio started to say.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "No! don't you dare say it!" Agatha said. "He's our son! Save him! please! Don't take him!" Agatha begged.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I have to," Rio told Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You don't have to do anything! and if you loved us, you wouldn't!" Agatha said.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Hearing her past words Agatha knows what she has to do and because of that she moves and stands in front of Rio, blocking her view of what they are re-experiencing, causing Agatha's past words, words that were full of pain, hate and grief, to fade away.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know you love us," Agatha tells Rio. "I know you had no choice, that you had to do your job," Agatha tells Rio. "I'm sorry for what I am about to say, I'm sorry I blamed you," Agatha tells Rio, finally giving the apology she should have given a long time ago.
    </p>
<p>
     "I deserved it," Rio says. "I did take him away, I'm so sorry," Rio says, her voice breaking. "I didn't want to," Rio says, and in response Agatha hugs her, holding her close. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," Rio says, as she breaks down in Agatha's arms, and because they are so consumed by their own grief neither Rio nor Agatha notice who has joined them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, it's okay," Nicky says, and his mothers break apart and see him, both feeling amazed. "It was my time, I was too little, too sick," Nicky says, walking towards his mothers. "But you made sure I was okay, you made sure I found peace, and I did, until you were able to bring me back for my second chance," Nicky tells his mothers. "I was okay because of you, I love you, both of you, so much," Nicky tells his mothers and in response they both hug him, tightly. "You both need to forgive yourselves, because I do, because I'm okay because of the two of you," Nicky assures her mothers, as they continue to hug him tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you?" Agatha asks her son, when they finally break apart after a few moments. "Are you really okay?" Agatha asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, a little bruised, but I'm okay," Nicky tells his mothers. "Um, so I may have destroyed Evanora's ghost," Nicky admits, feeling that it is important he tells them that, and knowing that his mom was right, and that Evanora has no right to be called Grandmother.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did," Rio tells him. "That's something pretty incredible," Rio tells her son, clearly proud of him, despite everything else she is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     "What can I say? I take after my moms," Nicky says with a smile, and in response, both Agatha and Rio, hug him again.
    </p>
<p>
     "We love you so much," Rio says as she hugs her son.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, I love you too," Nicky says, and the three of them break apart once more. "Mom, you need to forgive yourself, you need to let go of the guilt I know you carry," Nicky tells his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know if I can," Rio admits, and as she does everyone feels a small Earthquake.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you have to," Agatha tells her wife, not saying that because of the earthquake, but because she knows it's what Rio needs. "I think that's your trial," Agatha tells her. "Ri, I know I've hurt you, and I've blamed you, and I'm sorry about that, but I don't anymore. I don't think I ever truly did it was just easier to blame you than myself," Agatha admits. "But no more, I forgive you, Nicky forgives you, it's time to forgive yourself," Agatha tells her. "You were doing your job, it wasn't your fault," Agatha says. "Say it," Agatha encourages.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was doing my job… it wasn't my fault," Rio says, and as soon as she says the words three things happen, the first is that both Agatha and Nicky hug her again, the second is that another flower arch appears, and the third is the earth stops shaking.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few moments Rio, Agatha, and Nicky all break apart and once they do Agatha reaches out and wipes the tears off Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should go," Agatha tells Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know," Rio responds, and after taking a deep breath Rio, with her son and her wife standing either side of her, while the rest of the coven stand behind them, walk through the arch, walking to the next part of her past that Rio needs to forgive herself for.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as the group walk through the arch they find themselves outside again, and this time it is a location that not just Rio and Agatha recognize, but Nicky does too.
    </p>
<p>
     "We lived here," Nicky says, looking around and seeing the house he died in, in burned ruins. "What happened?" Nicky asks, feeling confused, as he is sure that it didn't look like this the last time he was actually there.
    </p>
<p>
     "When mom took you to the veil I lost control, destroyed almost everything," Agatha reveals, though judging by the exact way everything is destroyed she is sure that this memory isn't from exactly after Nicky died, in fact, she has a sinking suspicion she knows exactly when this is.
    </p>
<p>
     "I got back and found everything in ruins… just like the life we built together," Rio says sadly, remembering what it felt like to find their home on fire, and that that is exactly why she has tried so hard to keep the cottage in good condition, because she didn't want to lose another place, she considered to be a home.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not destroyed anymore," Agatha assures Rio, who nods.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, if this is your memory where are you?" Jen asks, feeling confused about that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait," Agatha says, and seconds after she does both Agatha and Rio, neither looking particularly older than the previous memory, teleport into the location.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Here? Really?" Agatha asked, a look of fury on her face.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I wanted to remind you of who you used to be," Rio told Agatha, and even though it is just a memory everyone can almost feel the power, and pain, radiated off both women.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Hearing that Nicky suspects he is about to see the fight that caused his mama to hide herself from his mom, and while he is incredibly curious about that, he is also incredibly concerned about how his moms are going to handle this.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Well then you picked the wrong place," Agatha said. "All I see here is everything you took from me," Agatha said, angrily.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I took from you? He was my son too! And he died! I couldn't change that!" Rio exclaimed, and as she did Agatha gave a bitter laugh.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As she is reminded of her past selves' words Rio looks down at the ground and after a few moments she feels Agatha reach out and take her hand, offering her silent support.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're death! You can do anything you want," Agatha said to her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Not that," Rio said. "Agatha, nothing can bring him back," Rio told Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I don't believe that I'm going to get him back!" Agatha exclaims.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "How? By losing yourself in the Darkhold?" Rio asked, taking a step forward.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Hearing that Jen and Lilia exchange looks, both of them knowing enough about the Darkhold to appreciate the significance of that, while Jen suspects they're about to find out how Agatha got the Book of Dammed.
    </p>
<p>
     As Nicky hears the words, he realises that what he is suspected is true, that his mama went after the Darkhold because of him, which means everything that followed happened because of him, something which makes him feel incredibly guilty.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's not the answer, Agatha," Rio told her. "Even if the book was able to bring him back, if you use it, if you gave what you would need to give it to do, so you'd be so lost Nicky wouldn't even recognize you," Rio told Agatha, having felt that she needed to do whatever she could to stop Agatha from going after the Darkhold which she was close to getting.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You have no right! No right to say his name!" Agatha told Rio as tears of fury came to her eyes. "I am going to get my son back," Agatha said, stressing the 'my'. "And I'm never going to see you again," Agatha told Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You can't hide from me, Agatha," Rio told her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Watch me," Agatha said, at the time already having decided that she was going to use the Darkhold to hide from Rio, and she turned away from Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha! Please! Don't do this," Rio begged. "Don't use that damn book!" Rio exclaims. "It's not the answer!" Rio exclaimed, reaching for Agatha, and in response Agatha used her magic to throw Rio backwards.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Because of you it's the only answer I have," Agatha said. "Goodbye Rio," Agatha said before teleporting away, as Rio broke down.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "You blamed yourself because I went after the Darkhold?" Agatha asks Rio surprised, as she didn't realise that.
    </p>
<p>
     "I couldn't stop you," Rio says, guilt in her voice, as she can't help but wonder how different things would have been if she had managed to stop Agatha from going after that Darkhodl.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ri, nothing was gong to stop me," Agatha said, the old nickname slipping from her lips without her even thinking about it. "At this point the Darkhold was already calling for me, already influencing me, nothing was going to keep me from that book," Agatha admits. "But that was my choice, my decision, not yours," Agatha tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I hate that I couldn't save you from it," Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved," Alice says, knowing that from her own experience.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's right," Agatha says, feeling thankful for Alice. "I didn't want to be saved," Agatha admits. "You did everything you could, but this was something even you couldn't change," Agatha tells her wife. "This is on me, so is everything that happened because of it, not you," Agatha tells Rio. "This guilt, this blame, you need to let go of it," Agatha says, and after a few moments of hesitation Rio gives a nod.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Rio nods another flowered arch appears, but instead of walking through it Agatha once again embraces Rio, holding her tight, wishing she could keep Rio from needing to re-experience this pain, but she knows she can't.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry," Rio says to Agatha in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't have to be," Agatha assures Rio, as she kisses her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     As he watches his mothers embrace each other Nicky wants to do something to help them, but as he watches he knows he can't, so instead he just watches them, wishing very much that his mothers weren't in so much pain.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few moments Agatha and Rio break apart and once they do, they once again walk, hand in hand through the arch, neither having any idea what they are gong to face on the other side, but knowing that, as hard as it may be, they will face it together.

<strong>
      AN
     </strong>
     : Thank you so much for the support. Here is another chapter. I may post another chapter when I am working, or be closer to my normal time, I'm not sure yet. It depends on how busy I am while working.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As Rio and Agatha lead themselves, their son, and their coven, through the next arch they find themselves in a location that for once Agatha doesn't recognize, but both Rio and Nicky do.
    </p>
<p>
     "A hospital?" Agatha asks confused, as she looks around, trying to figure out the time period this is taking place in.
    </p>
<p>
     "I remember this," Nicky realises. "Mom, this wasn't your fault," Nicky tells her, understanding exactly what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     "I left you," Rio tells him. "It was my fault," Rio tells her son, and while Agatha is incredibly confused, she doesn't say anything, she just watches the memory play out as she knows it's the best way to get the answers, she is seeking without causing Rio even more pain.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      Help! I need help!" Rio yelled, panic having been perfectly clear in her voice, as she carried who everyone recognized as Nicky into the emergency room.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "When was this?" Alice asks, looking between Rio and Nicky, trying to figure out exactly how long ago this was.
    </p>
<p>
     "A little over a year after mom brought me back form the veil, seven years ago," Nicky explains, and Agatha realises that Nicky would have been eight.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What happened?" A nurse asked, as she came out from the behind the reception desk.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I got home, and all the windows were open, he's so cold, I don't know how long he has been like this," Rio said, and Agatha can hear the guilt in his voice.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Mom, it wasn't your fault. I choose to open the windows in October, when we were in the Scottish Highlands," Nicky reminds her, knowing now that wasn't the smartest decision he's ever made, but at the time he didn't even think about it.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you wouldn't have gotten so sick if I had been home sooner," Rio tells Nicky, still feeling incredibly guilty about that, and everyone watches as past Rio is lead over to a bed where she lays Nicky down on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What's his name? how old is he?" the nurse asked.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Nicky… Nicholas Scratch," Rio says.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Is that really your name?" Jen asks, feeling that that is very unfortunate.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, it's my main alias," Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     "You need an alias?" Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Does that surprise you?" Nicky asks, feeling that out of everyone Lilia should be the least surprised by that.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, I guess not," Lilia admits, feeling that considering who his mothers are that actually makes perfect sense.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Any medical conditions? Or past medical issues?" The nurse asked.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Pneumonia," Rio said, her voice breaking, and hearing the pain in Rio's past selves voice, Agatha squeezes her hand. "Last year… it was bad," Rio said. "Please, please help him," Rio begged.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Death begs," Jen mutters, feeling shocked by that, and luckily for her neither Agatha nor Nicky hear her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We will, ma'am," the nurse said as several people came running over to the bed. "But we need you to give us some space so we can work,"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "No, I'm not leaving my son," Rio said.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "I shouldn't have left," Rio mutters, feeling guilty that she did, even though she was forced out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "You had to, it's okay," Nicky assures his mother, and everyone watches as Rio is dragged out of the hospital room.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Nicky! I'm right here! I'm not going anywhere! I love you," Rio yelled to her son.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "I heard you," Nicky tells his mom. "And because of that I knew I was going to be okay," Nicky assures Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did?" Rio asks surprised, as she didn't know that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, I did," Nicky confirms. "You made me feel brave, Mom," Nicky assures his mother.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Damn it," Rio said angrily, as she walked over to a wall which she punched. "Damn it Agatha, you should be here," Rio said, as she punched the wall again. "Why did you have to become so obsessed with that damn book, why did you have to hide yourself," Rio said, her voice breaking. "We need you," Rio said as she slid down the wall as she broke down in tears.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "I'm so sorry I wasn't there," Agatha tells Rio. "That I wasn't there for both of you," Agatha says, as she looks between Rio and Nicky, feeling incredibly guilty that she wasn't there for them, especially when they so clearly needed her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You didn't know," Rio tells her. "I shouldn't have been angry at you for not being there," Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     "You were trying to do everything alone, some anger is justified… it's okay," Agatha assures her, feeling that considering the circumstances Rio was completely justified in what she was feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, you looked after me," Nicky assures his mother. "Even with an entire universe of responsibilities you looked after me. You did everything you could to make sure I was safe, you have nothing to feel guilty about," Nicky assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio for eight years you were there for our son, you looked after him, supported him, you protected him, made sure he was happy," Agatha reminds her. "I am so amazed by you, so proud, and so incredibly thankful," Agatha assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, I'm okay because of you," Nicky tells her. "I may not have had the most normal upbringing, but I was never going to have that, what you gave me was incredible, I love you," Nicky tells his mom before hugging her and whispering something in her ear. As mother and son embrace, and as Rio forgives herself just a little more, another arch appears.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, even though the arch appears, Rio and Nicky don't break apart, Rio just continues to hold her son who she feels like she let down, and it becomes clear that that is not what the trial is as the Earth begins to shake once more.
    </p>
<p>
     "Guess we should go," Nicky realises, as he breaks apart from his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, guess so," Rio says reluctantly, and once again the group make their way to the arch.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Walking through the arch the group find that they are once again outside, this time in a location that they all recognize.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is Westview," Jen realises, and as she does Nicky is looking around, trying to figure out exactly when it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, no," Nicky says, as decorations that tell him exactly when it is; New Years Eve 2024.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky?" Agatha asks her son concerned, but before Nicky can answer the entire group hear Nicky and Rio's voices so they turn to the house they share where Nicky, who is younger than he currently is not overly so, and Rio are both walking out of.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I won't be too late, I'll make responsible choices, and promise I won't do anything dangerous," Nicky told his mother.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You know I am meant to be giving you rules, it's kind of the parent thing," Rio told Nicky, and Agatha can't help but smile at that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh? What rules would you give me?" Nicky asked his mother, and Rio paused for a moment.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Whatever you just said sounds good," Rio said, and Nicky laughed.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Seriously?" Jen asks amused, though as she watches Rio and Nicky it perfectly clear that they are a mother and so who truly care about each other.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky's a pretty responsible teenager, what he was saying seemed fine to me," Rio responds, feeling nervous about what is going to happen next as while she remembers this conversation with Nicky, she doesn't remember much of what happened next.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "In all seriousness I want you to have fun, okay?" Rio said to her son, and only Agatha appreciates the irony of Rio saying 'seriousness'.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Okay," Nicky said before hugging her. "I love you mom," Nicky said.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Love you too," Rio said, and after a moment they broke apart. "Now, go, have fun," Rio told her son.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I will, by mom," Nicky said before hurrying down the path, heading towards the town centre.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      After watching her son go it is clear Rio is debating what do, and rather than heading back inside she, likes Nicky, walks out of the yard, but instead of going in the direction he went in she goes in the opposite direction and walks down the street, and Agatha realises exactly where she is going.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "You going to see me," Agatha realises.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah," Rio confirms, and for Nicky what he found when he returned home that night is starting to make a lot more sense.
    </p>
<p>
     "I thought you said you had been apart for a while," Alice says, confused, not understanding what she is missing.
    </p>
<p>
     "We were," Agatha says. "I was under a spell, under the control of another, I wasn't myself," Agatha says. truthfully, she is curious to see herself under the spell, see how she interacts with Rio, but, considering Nicky's reaction, she is incredibly concerned about what she is going to witness, as she can't help the horrible feeling that is telling her that as 'Agnes' she is about to do something that is going to hurt Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      As Rio gets to what everyone recognizes as Agatha's house it is clear that for a second Rio questions her decision, but then she clearly uses magic to conjure a bottle of scotch before walking the rest of the way to the house where she knocks on the door.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      After a few seconds the door opens to reveal Agatha dressed in short shorts and a tank top, clothing very inappropriate for the middle of winter in New Jersey, with her hair up in a messy bun.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      What the hell do you want?" Agnes asked, angrily and the fact that Rio looks completely unphased by her anger concerns, and hurts, Agatha deeply as it tells her that it is something she had gotten used to.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      A brought a peace offering," Rio said as she showed Agatha the bottle of scotch she conjured.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      Then I guess you better come in," Agnes said, and Rio followed her into the house.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      That explains the outfit," Rio said to herself quietly as she felt how hot it was into the house, it having been perfectly clear to her that the heater and fireplace where both on high. "Bit warm in here, isn't it…. Agnes," Rio said.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      It's the middle of summer, what do you expect," Agnes said, showing everyone who is watching just how out of phase with reality she is, something which makes Lilia, who appreciates just how much control Agatha would have been under to achieve this result, frown.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      Right, summer," Rio muttered, as she followed Agatha through to the kitchen.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      You know all these new recruits are driving me crazy, almost makes me miss the old days," Agnes, said, and everyone notices Rio tense at that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      When you were the one driving people crazy?" Rio asked, as she tried to adapt to Agatha's reality.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      It was much more fun," Agatha said, giving Rio a very pointed look. "The things we got up to," Agnes said, lowering her voice.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      Impossible to forget," Rio said, returning the look on Agatha's face.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Hearing the tones, and seeing the looks on both hers and Rio's face Agatha feels concerned as she knows what usually follow those looks, but she also knows Rio, and knows that when she wasn't herself there is no way Rio would let anything happen between them, which means something they are about to witness something very uncomfortable.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I've got no clean glasses over here; can you grab some form that cupboard?" Agatha requested.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Sure," Rio said, before walking over to the cupboard to get the cups. Once she has the cups Rio turns around to Agatha pushing up against her. "Aga…nes," Rio said, it being clear that she was about to say Agatha and not Agnes. "What are you doing?" Rio asked, moving out of the way as Agnes tried to kiss her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Exactly what you intended when you showed up on my door," Agnes said, as she tried to kiss Rio again, but Rio once again moved out of the way.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As she watches the memory play out Rio looks down at the ground, feeling incredibly guilty that she let it go on for as long as she did. While Nicky is very uncomfortable but because he doesn't want his moms to feel worse than they clearly already do he does his best not to let that show.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I didn't come here for this," Rio said, and she pushed Agatha back, with a little more force than she intended, which caused Agatha to stumble, and hit her leg on the kitchen island. "I should go," Rio said, and without another word she ran out of the house, clearly looking upset, and to her own house.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Once inside her own house everyone watches as Rio picks up multiple bottles of scotch and starts to drink them, quickly.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Can Death get drunk?" Jen asks, trying to lighten the mood as they all understand the implications of what they just watched.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not easily," Rio admits. "But I guess I must have succeeded, because I don't remember much after this," Rio admits, and as she does, she notices Nicky looking down at the ground, clearly avoiding looking at everyone else. "But you do," Rio says to her son. "Nicky, what happened?" Rio asks worried, feeling worried about what she must have put him through, and Nicky avoids answering her. "Nicky, tell me," Rio tells her son in a stern tone of voice, one that Nicky knows not to ignore as it's not often his mom uses it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Um, so I got home just before midnight, and there was a lot of empty bottles," Nicky says, trying to explain as little as possible, as he really, really doesn't want to cause his mom more pain.
    </p>
<p>
     "What else?" Rio asks, knowing her son well enough to know that there is something he isn't saying.
    </p>
<p>
     "You were crying," Nicky says, and Agatha feels a rush of guilt, as she knows it's her fault, that she caused Rio so much pain. "You said how you missed her, how you just wanted her back, I assumed you were talking about Mama," Nicky admits, causing both his mothers to feel guilty about that. "You passed out, I used my magic to levitate you to bed," Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am so sorry you had to do that," Rio tells her son, feeling incredibly guilty that she put him through that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, it's okay, you were hurting, it's okay," Nicky assures her, and he hugs his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Neither of you have any reason to apologize," Agatha says, and once she does both Rio and Nicky break apart to look at her. "You did the right thing in an incredible painful situation," Agatha says to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I couldn't do anything else, not when you weren't yourself," Rio tells Agatha, wanting to make it clear that she never let anything happen between them when Agatha was Agnes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know," Agatha says, having never even considered she would. "And Nicky, you looked after mom, that was incredible of you," Agatha tells her son. "I am sorry that you were even put in the situation in the first place," Agatha tells them.
    </p>
<p>
     "You were under a spell, you didn't willingly choose it," Rio reminds her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did choose to go after the Scarlett Witch, the spell was my consequence," Agatha tells her. "Neither of you have any reason to feel guilty about what happened to me because of that," Agatha says, wanting to make that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     "Easier said than done," Nicky tells his mama as for him he feels guilty that he didn't break the spell sooner, and nothing either of his moms say is going to change that.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know," Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think that's the point of this trial," Lilia says, and everyone looks at her. "It's not just about Rio forgiving herself, but all three of you forgiving yourselves… and each other," Lilia says. "You all need to let go of the past, so that you can move on, find harmony, together," Lilia says and as she speaks Westview fades away and they are back in the clearing they were in when they first appeared in the trial.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're back where we started," Alice realises.
    </p>
<p>
     "But no exit, or memory," Jen says as the ground starts to rumble.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's because Lilia's right," Agatha says, saying words she wouldn't have said not too long ago. "All three of us have guilt, all three of us have pain, but we need to move forward, we need to be in harmony with each other," Agatha says. "I am sorry about the choices I made that kept us apart, I am sorry for the unjust hate and anger I felt towards you," Agatha says to Rio. "And I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you. I'm sorry that I missed so much of your life," Agatha says to Nicky, tears coming to her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I forgive you Mama," Nicky assures her. "And I'm sorry that I didn't figure out how to break the spell sooner," Nicky admits. "I'm sorry that I couldn't bring you back together sooner," Nicky tells his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     "I forgive you Nicky," Rio tells her son, even though she doesn't feel he needs to be she can appreciate that he needs to hear the words. "And I forgive you, Agatha," Rio says, looking at her. "I am sorry that I couldn't spare you all those years ago, that I had to take you," Rio tells Nicky. "And I am sorry that I couldn't find you, stop you; I'm sorry that we were apart for so long because I couldn't put us back together," Rio says, as she looks between Nicky and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "I forgive you Mom," Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     "I forgive you, Rio, and you Nicky," Agatha says, and as soon as she says the words the three of them embrace, holding each other tight as they all finally let go of guilt, and pain, they have been carrying around for a very long time. "I love you, I love you both, so much," Agatha says as she holds the two people who she loves most.
    </p>
<p>
     "And we love you too," Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     "So much," Rio adds, and as she does Jen, Lilia and Alice see, to their relief, the way out of the trial appears.
    </p>
<p>
     "The exit," Alice says, pointing to it. "We should go," Alice says and as they hear her words Agatha, Rio, and Nicky break apart, and almost feeling lighter, the family of three and their Coven, head out of the trial together; knowing they still have a lot to deal with, to come to terms with, but they just took a huge first step.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Sorry, I did plan to update sooner, but I have been obsessed with planning a new multichapter Agathario fic I’m starting. Next update of this story will be in less than twelve hours. Hope you enjoy this chapter.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Moments after they left Rio’s trial the group once again walk back onto the road which they see now has a yellow hue to it, confirming what they all suspected, that the last trial is going to be Lilia’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “One trial to go,” Jen realises, feeling pretty amazed by that, feeling shocked that they are all so close to their goal, something she wasn’t sure they were going to achieve.
    </p>
<p>
     “And none of us are ready for it,” Alice says, knowing that, as what they just witnessed wasn’t just a lot for Rio, Nicky and Agatha, but all of them. “Are the Salem Seven close?” Alice asks Nicky, remembering what he said about being able to sense them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Give me a sec,” Nicky says, closing his eyes and focusing, and after a few moments he opens his eyes once more. “No,” Nicky reveals. “But I did see them when I was below The Road,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Are you okay?” Agatha asks worried.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m fine, they didn’t get close,” Nicky assures his mother, though he is very glad to hear he be concerned as it is something he has wanted for so long. “I caved a tunnel in behind me, it didn’t kill them, but it might have slowed them down for a little while,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which means we can take some time to catch our breaths,” Lilia says, not just suggesting that because she wants to delay her trial, but because she knows they all need it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like a good plan,” Alice says approvingly, being pretty sure that Agatha, Rio, and Nicky need that. “So, we should split up, collect what we need to make camp,” Alice suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “No one is going anywhere alone,” Agatha says, as considering everything that happened, she feels like that is best.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably a good idea,” Nicky admits. “So, how about Alice and I go get some firewood,” Nicky suggests, doing so because he wants to give his moms a chance to talk, and out of the others Alice is who he is most comfortable with, though he does like Lilia. “Jen and Lilia can start to set up camp, and mom and mama you can obtain food,” Nicky says, making it seem like they would have to go looking for it, but knowing that, at least to a degree, his mom will be able to conjure that kind of thing; though his mama wouldn’t be able to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like a good plan,” Lilia says approvingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stay with Alice do not go off alone,” Agatha tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will stay with Alice, I won’t go off alone,” Nicky assures his mama, and as he does Agatha gives Alice a look.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll watch out for him, promise,” Alice assures Agatha, as she looks between her and Rio, and after a few moments the group split up into their different groups, going in different directions.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A few minutes after the group split up Nicky and Alice are collecting firewood together, and as they silently collect the wood Alice realises that Nicky is pretty quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Alice asks, breaking the silence. “That must have been pretty intense to experience,” Alice assumes, thinking about what it was like to learn what happened to her mom, and how hard that was, she can’t imagine how much harder it was for Nicky to actually relieve some of his family’s most painful moments.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it was,” Nicky confirms, not really sure he wants to talk about it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, sometimes it can be easier to talk to someone who a bit removed from the situation, so if you want to talk about everything that’s happened, I’m here,” Alice says, wanting to help the boy who she is starting to see as a little brother.
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing Alice’s words Nicky debates what to do for a moment, but then he stops searching for wood and looks at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s strange, my entire life… both of them, I’ve always thought mom was incredibly strong, she’s literally death, I thought nothing could hurt her, I didn’t realise how much pain she was in, how much guilt she carried,” Nicky admits, feeling incredibly guilty that he didn’t realise just how much his mom was struggling, not realising that that is exactly what Rio tried to protect him from.
    </p>
<p>
     “Parents tend to protect us from that kind of thing,” Alice says, thinking of everything her mother tried to protect her from, even if she didn’t always succeed, everything she wished she knew long before now,.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shouldn’t I have seen it though?” Nicky asks as it feels like he should have considering how much time he and his mother spend together. “For so long all I’ve wanted is my moms back together, for us to be a family again, and now I can’t help but worry that I’m not the son they deserve,” Nicky says sadly, feeling like he has let both his moms down in so many ways.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, look at me,” Alice says, and Nicky does that. “I know we don’t know each other that well but from what I’ve seen you’re already an incredible son, you looked after your mom, broke the spell on your mama, was brave enough to come down the road even though they didn’t know who you were, that’s pretty incredible,” Alice tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Alice,” Nicky says, not sure if he completely believes her words, but he knows he wants to.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome,” Alice tells him. “You know when we get out of here you can always call me, I know a thing or to about being the child of infamous witch and what can be like, and how there are things that, as amazing as they are, you just can’t bring yourself to talk to your mom about. So, if you ever want to talk I’m here,” Alice assures Nicky, wanting to give him what she never had.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like a sister?” Nicky asks, as that’s what it seems like to him, but which isn’t something he has any experience with.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly like a sister,” Alice says with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Alice,” Nicky responds, returning her smile, and the two of them continue to pick up the firewood together.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Away from where their son is talking with Alice Agatha and Rio have gone off alone, even though they didn’t technically have to, and have started to see what kind of food and water they can obtain. For Agatha as they fill up containers Rio conjured with water, they have checked to make sure is safe, the most concerning part of what they are doing isn’t that they are going to willingly drink water from the Road, but the fact that Rio is being so quiet, something she almost never is.
    </p>
<p>
     As she finishes filling up her continues Agatha walks over to Rio and squat down next to her, putting her hand on Rio’s back if she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi,” Agatha says, trying to figure out exactly what is going on with Rio, as she starts to gently rub circles in Rio’s back, Rio leaning into her touch as she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why aren’t you mad at me?” Rio asks in a quiet voice, about a minute after she first felt Agatha’s hand, a voice so unlike her, as considering everything she doesn’t understand why Agatha isn’t madder at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would I be mad?” Agatha asks confused, and Rio turns to look at her. The second Rio looks at her Agatha sees pain behind her eyes, and very much wishes she could take it away from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because Nicky got sick, again, because of me, because I keep getting close to you even though you weren’t yourself because I missed you; I may have not let anything happen, but I was still selfish,” Rio admits, guilt in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, Sweetheart, you are a lot of things, Selfish isn’t one of them,” Agatha assures Rio. “Nicky got sick by accident,” Agatha reminds her, as that was clear from both the memories and what Nicky said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I wasn’t there,” Rio reminds her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t there either,” Agatha points out. “Ri, you were there for him, even with an entire universe that needed you, you were still there for him,” Agatha says, quoting what Nicky said earlier as she knows he was right. “Nicky loves you. Even before the Sigil broke that was clear to me. To him you’ve been, you are, the most incredible mother, that’s what matters,” Agatha tells Rio, knowing that while she is curious about what happened in the last eight years she isn’t at all worried as she knows, without a doubt, that Rio would have done an incredible job looking after and raising their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve tried to be,” Rio admits, not sure if she has succeeded.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are,” Agatha assures her, kissing her shoulder. “And as for when I was under the spell, I can’t imagine how hard it was for you to be so close and have me have no idea who you really were, what we had together,” Agatha admits, and as she does Rio moves a little so she can look at Agatha better.
    </p>
<p>
     “The worse part wasn’t that you didn’t remember me, or even, as painful as it was, that you didn’t know Nicky, it was that you didn’t know yourself,” Rio admits. “After we left Salem, after you broke free of your mother, and you started to believe you weren’t who she made you feel like you were, you were always so confident in who you are. Even when you let people believe the worst in you, you knew who you were and that gave you an incredible confidence,” Rio says, knowing that once Agatha gained it Rio always found the confidence, she had in herself incredibly sexy.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was only able to do that because you gave me the courage, because you believed in me,” Agatha tells Rio, knowing that because of Rio she believed in herself, because of Rio she learned not to hate herself quiet as much.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Sweetheart, you did it on your own. I just helped you see you didn’t have to hide anymore,” Rio admits, reaching out and pushing Agatha’s hair out of her face. “But when you were under that spell… You had no idea,” Rio admits, pain in her voice. “Sometimes I would see parts of you come through, and I savoured those moments, but they would never last,” Rio admits, sounding sad about that. “It was selfish of me to savour them, to not try harder to use them to break through; I never let anything happen, I never would, but I did look forward to the moments when you were almost like yourself,” Rio admits, feeling guilty about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s completely understandable,” Agatha admits. “Rio, I trust you,” Agatha says, and considering everything she has been through those three words are bigger than ‘I love you’ for Agatha to say. “I have no doubt that you looked out for me when I was under the spell, that you made sure I wasn’t hurt or violated more than I already was,” Agatha says, believing that. “I also understand that you would want to savour the good moments, and I think you’re being too hard on yourself. You did nothing wrong,” Agatha assures Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You trust me?” Rio asks, needing to make sure she heard right as she knows that, because of everything she experienced growing up, that she experienced because of her mother and her mother’s coven, that trust isn’t something Agatha gives easily; even to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I trust you,” Agatha repeats, and once she does, she leans forward and kisses Rio, making it clear that she trusts Rio with everything she has, everything she is.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Alice and Nicky, as well as Rio and Agatha, are all having some pretty intense conversations, Lilia and Jen are adoring their best to set up the camp, but considering they isn’t much they can do without what the others are collecting they are at a bit of a stalemate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, they would be taking so long,” Jen says annoyed, and Lilia decides to ask something she has been curious about for a while as it seems like it’s the perfect opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there something you want to talk about, Jen?” Lilia asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like what?” Jen asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like whatever your history with Agatha is that is causing you to be so determined to hold onto your anger,” Lilia responds, like it’s the most obvious thing, as it kind of is.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it that obvious we have a history?” Jen asks, even though she can admit she hasn’t done the best job at hiding it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely,” Lilia says, honestly, she is surprised Rio hasn’t reacted to it. “Do you want to talk about it?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not particularly, but I probably should,” Jen admits, as she sits down on a nearby log, and sighs. “You know what I said about my family, that I am just the latest in a long line, well because of that I was raised hearing warnings; one of which was to stay away from the Infamous Agatha Harkness,” Jen explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course,” Lilia says with a frown, knowing that there were a lot of people who were told that warning, but now that she has gotten a chance to know Agatha, she isn’t sure if that is justified, but she is equally sure that it may have been Agatha herself who made that warning so popular.
    </p>
<p>
     “When, in my early twenties, I was feeling rebellious, so I sought Agatha out,” Jen admits, knowing that at the time it seemed like the best way to rebel. “I know now that when I found her it wouldn’t have been long after she lost Nicky, not long after she ended things with Rio, that she would have already had the Darkhold,” Jen explains, and Lilia has a sinking suspicion she can guess what kind of state Jen found Agatha in. “I was… fascinated… infatuated,” Jen admits, feeling a little embarrassed about that now. “I don’t know if Agatha was ever actually interested, but she made me feel special, and like an annoyance, powerful, and weak, smart, and like the biggest idiot, all at the same time,” Jen admits, knowing that that time were some of the best, but also the worst, in her life. “After I was bound, I didn’t know where else to go, so I went to Agatha… and she slammed her door in my face,” Jen admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “And that’s why you have so much anger towards her, why you feel so betrayed,” Lilia realises, feeling that it makes sense, and that from Jen’s perspective it is completely justified. “Have you ever tried to talk to her about it?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’ve spent the last hundred years making an effort to avoid her,” Jen admits, knowing it wasn’t the bravest option, but it was the one she needed to make for herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should… I’m not picking a side, but I think there is something you’re not seeing,” Lilia admits, feeling that it may be very important for both Jen and Agatha to actually talk to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Jen asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just think about it,” Lilia says, as if Agatha already had the Darkhold when Jen was bound then there was no way for Jen to be safe around Agatha if she didn’t have her magic, which means Agatha may have been trying to protect her by shutting her door on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Jen says, feeling confused, and as she and Liila continue to try and get everything set up she can’t help but think about Lilia’s words as she tries to figure out what they mean.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A while after they went their sperate ways everyone is sitting around the fire at the campsite Lilia put together, eating the food Rio was able to obtain. As they eat everyone notices that things are rather quiet, and awkward, but it is also clear that no one is in a rush to end the awkwardness. Deciding that he might as well change things when it is clear that no one else is going to Nicky decides to break the ice; and he has the perfect idea how to do that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama, guess what?” Nicky asks, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What, Sweetheart?” Agatha asks her son, feeling interested about what he is going to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was able to get Mom to dress up as the Grim Reaper for Halloween one year,” Nicky reveals, and Rio rolls her eyes at that, though she has to admit that the amount of joy it has brought Nicky is almost worth how much she disliked it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Agatha asks surprised. “You said no every time I suggested it,” Agatha says to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because it’s so fun to say no to you,” Rio says with a smirk, one that Agatha knows the exact meaning of, while everyone else can guess as it’s not exactly subtle.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eww,” Nicky says, pulling a face, realising what his moms are implying. “I was going to say I have pictures, now I’m not sure I want to,” Nicky mutters, and Alice who is closest to him, and heard what he said, laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you feel about all the stereotypical portrayals of death?” Lilia asks Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here we go,” Jen mutters, being sure that this conversation is going to go off the rails very quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve gotten some amusement from some of them…. Some annoyance from others,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s an understatement” Agatha comments. “You once revealed yourself to an entire Halloween party because you didn’t like the fact, they were having a ‘best grim reaper’ costume contest,” Agatha reminds Rio, knowing that was a very good night.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seriously?” Nicky asks his mother amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was in a little bit of a mood,” Rio says with a shrug, feeling like it’s no big deal.
    </p>
<p>
     “Understatement,” Agatha says amused, causing Rio to turn to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we really going to talk about what happens when in a mood, miss ‘I’m going to sink an ocean liner for fun? Because of the bad mood I was in?’” Rio asks Agatha, causing the others to be very amused, but also confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “How many times do I have to tell you, it was a coincidence,” Agatha responds. “I was just looking forward to a boat trip, I didn’t know it was going to crash into an ice burg,” Agatha responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you say,” Rio says, clearly not believing her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, are you talking about the Titanic?” Alice asks, as that’s what it sounds like.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, which I did not sink,” Agatha says, giving Rio a pointed look, not mentioning that she did stop a few people from getting on the lifeboats, but those people didn’t deserve to survive after some of the things they were doing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you say,” Rio says, clearly not believing her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do I get the feeling you’ve had this fight before,” Nicky says, looking between his moms, as that’s what it seems like to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “We have,” Agatha and Rio say together, and as they do Rio decides to explain something, as she knows that once he starts to think about it a little more Nicky will be very confused about something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Before Westview we may not have seen each other for a long time, but we did, on occasion, leave messages for each other,” Rio admits, knowing that became less common, until it completely stopped, the more corrupted by the Darkhold Agatha became.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Like some weird way to flirt?” Jen asks, as that’s what it sounds like and it’s honestly not something she would put past the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “More like… I want your attention and no one else to have it,” Agatha admits, and Nicky is fascinated to know that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I knew it,” Rio says, feeling rather proud about that, as that is what she has always suspected, but she has never been able to confirm it.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, we’ve settled that the sinking the Titanic isn’t true…” Alice starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t settled anything,” Rio says, and Agatha rolls her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about you being the inspiration for Jolene?” Alice asks, ignoring Rio’s comment as she assumes that is something they are not going to get a resolution to anytime soon, as while she didn’t know much about Agatha before they met that is one thing that she has heard about. “Is that true?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah Agatha, is that true?” Rio asks, giving her wife a very pointed look, once again causing Agatha to roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “There may be a nugget of truth,” Agatha says, though it was certainly not Dolly’s husband who she was interested in, before starting to explain, and for the next little while the group share stories, getting to know each other a little better as they bond. While some members of the group would have a harder time admitting that than others it is clear that they are all glad to spend time just spending time together, with nothing to worry about.

      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I hope you like this chapter. Please let me know what you think. I will try to make the next chapter sooner than 12 hours so I can try to get three chapters posted tomorrow.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A while after Agatha explained about why people think she is the inspiration for the Dolly Parton Hit Jolene the entire coven, with the exception of Rio, who doesn’t need to, are asleep. As she holds Agatha and watches the others Rio realises that she has started to care about people other than Agatha and her son for the first time in her existence; something which worries her as she can’t imagine it ending well.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know that look,” A soft voice say, and Rio looks down to see Agatha is awake. “What are you thinking?” Agatha asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “That just like last time this Road has a way of giving something I didn’t even realise I needed,” Rio admits, admitting only part of what she is thinking about as she is still trying to figure out the other part.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it does,” Agatha admits, glancing over to where Nicky is sleeping. “He really decided to give you a birthday?” Agatha asks Rio, as that was one of the things they talked about when sharing stories.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it was important to him,” Rio reveals, looking amused about that. “We started a tradition for his birthday… breakfast cake in bed,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You make cake?” Agatha asks surprised, as she knows that Rio’s ‘cooking’ can leave a lot to be desired.
    </p>
<p>
     “The first year was awful,” Rio says with a laugh. “But Nicky didn’t care,” Rio admits. “I’ve gotten better with every year that passed,” Rio admits. “But it’s become our tradition, it means a lot… and we’ve both been waiting for when you’d be with us,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I look forward to it,” Agatha admits, though she knows it’s going to be hard when she knows it’s going to be Nicky’s seventeenth birthday, and while the two of them drift into silence their silence doesn’t last long until they hear moans, and mutters of;
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no, MOM!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice,” Agatha realises, and they both quickly get up and hurry over to where Alice is lying. “She won’t want to wake anyone else up,” Agatha says, knowing that, as one thing that has become clear about Alice is that she won’t want anyone’s pity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Got it,” Rio says, and she waves her hand in the direction where Nicky, Jen, and Lilia are lying, using her powers to make it so they all sleep a little deeper; but only for a little while.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, wake up,” Agatha says, squatting down next to Alice, gently shaking her awake, and second later Alice bolts upright, clearly afraid, and for a second it looks like she is going to blast Agatha with her powers. “Hey, it’s me, Agatha, you’re okay,” Agatha says, desperately hoping that Alice doesn’t try to blast her as she knows she isn’t going to be able to stop herself from siphoning Alice’s powers a second time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Alice asks confused, as she lowers her hands. “Rio?” Alice asks, looking between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were having a nightmare,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh,” Alice says, looking down at the ground, feeling a little embarrassed that she disturbed Agatha and Rio. “Sorry for waking you up,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Neither of us were asleep, it’s okay,” Agatha assures her, and as she does Alice looks down at the ground. “Alice?” Agatha asks gently, seeing that she needs to talk, even if she is hesitant to do so, something which she completely understands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you ever meet my mom?” Alice asks curious, as considering how long Agatha has been around, she wouldn’t be surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Once, briefly,” Agatha answers. “It was after one of her concerts, I don’t even remember where,” Agatha admits, which tells Rio a hall of a lot about the state Agatha must have been in. “We knew who each other were so we talked, shared a couple of bottles of wine, then went our separate ways,” Agatha explains, trying to explain in the most delicate way possible as she doesn’t want to cause Alice more pain, but she knows that neither she nor Lorna were in the best state of mind at the time. “When we talked it was clear we both had pain, but what was also clear was that she loved you more than anything,” Agatha assures Alice, who nods as tears comes to her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t want to leave you,” Rio says, causing both Agatha and Alice to look at her, Agatha knowing how unusual it is for Rio to talk about what happened to someone after they died, even with her, while Alice is just glad to know. “She was ready to let go of the pain she was in; she was ready to die, but she didn’t want to leave you,” Rio tells Alice. “She loved you more than anything,”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is she still in pain?” Alice asks, needing to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, she’s at peace now, there’s no pain where she is,” Rio assures her, and in response Alice hurries over and hugs her. For a second Rio tenses, feeling surprised, but then she relaxes into the hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Alice responds, it meaning everything to her to know that. “Both of you,” Alice adds, looking at Agatha as she breaks apart from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to thank either of us,” Agatha assures her. “Do you think you can try to get some more sleep?” Agatha asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think I can try,” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t sleep, so if you need anything we’ll be on the other side of the fire,” Rio tells Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Alice says, and once she does Agatha and Rio both stand up and head back over the file.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio and Agatha walk back over to where they were lying, leaving Alice to go back to sleep, Rio notices the look on Agatha’s face, and right away she knows what it means.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve just adopted her, haven’t we?” Rio asks, as that’s what it seems like to her, that she and Agatha are going to look out for Alice from now on.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did get her fired from her job,” Agatha admits, as they sit back down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty sure the generational curse may have played a part in that,” Rio tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “True, but I didn’t help,” Agatha admits, as she leans back against Rio, who wraps her arms around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to try to get some more sleep?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Agatha admits, feeling that considering they have already dealt with one member of the coven having a nightmare she isn’t sure she wants to subject Rio to dealing with her nightmares too.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Rio says, knowing better than trying to push Agatha into sleeping, so instead she just kisses Agatha’s neck, and continues to hold her, silently assuring Agatha that she is safe, as they watch their son, and the rest of the coven, including Alice, sleep.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A couple of hours, or at least that’s what it feels like even though time moves differently on The Road, after Alice had a nightmare Agatha, who didn’t go back to sleep is collecting more water for everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     While filling the water containers Agatha closes her eyes and lost focuses on the feeling of the soil beneath her feet, of the gentle wind blowing. As she is so focused on the feelings that are meant to ground her Agatha doesn’t hear the footsteps coming towards her, she doesn’t realise she is no longer alone until she feels a hand on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Acting on instinct Agatha quickly opens her eyes, turns, and makes the action to blast with her power, something she can’t do right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, it’s just me,” Lilia says, silently cursing herself for sneaking up on Agatha, and knowing she is lucky Agatha doesn’t have her magic, but also realising that she will not be forgetting the fear in Agatha’s eyes anytime soon.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?” Agatha asks, an edge to her voice, as her defence mechanism come to the surface.
    </p>
<p>
     “Helping, you’re the one who said that no one should go off alone,” Lilia reminds her, purposely not saying anything about Agatha’s reaction as she is sure that will just result in Agatha lashing out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right... I did say that,” Agatha admits, turning back to the water, and as she does Llia does the same. While Agatha is looking at the water as way to avoid talking Lilia looks at it and is reminded of something, something which she realises Agatha may be the only other person on The Road, who may appreciate it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Reminds you of the sabbats, in the old days, doesn’t it?” Lilia asks, as it certainly reminds her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t know, my mother never me attend,” Agatha reveals, and Lilia feels her heart sink as she remembers what they meant to witches, what it meant to her, so it hurts to know it was kept from Agatha. “She would lock me in my room, told me I didn’t deserve to go,” Agatha explains, knowing that sometimes it wasn’t the lock that kept her in the room but rather other things her mother did to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” Lilia tells her. “Agatha, you need to know that back then, in the old days, if another coven knew what your mother was doing, we would have stopped her,” Lilia tells Agatha, wanting to make that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to lie,” Agatha responds, not being able to believe what Lilia is saying. “I accepted what happened a long time ago,” Agatha tells Lilia, though she does appreciate what Lilia is trying to do, even if she can’t admit it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not lying,” Lilia says, and Agatha turns to look at her. “In the old days Covens were true sisterhoods. Even if we didn’t completely understand each other’s specific magic, we looked out for each other, protected each other,” Lilia reveals. “It was understood that if one of us were hurt we were all hurt,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds nice… not at all like what I experienced,” Agatha admits, knowing that her mothers coven were so devoted to her that they just followed Evanora’s lead, did what she wanted without questioning it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know; I’m sorry about that,” Lilia tells her. “Agatha, you deserved what every other witch born in our time had,” Lilia tells Agatha, who has to fight back her emotions at that, as she doesn’t want to admit that Lilia’s words are actually getting to her. “You deserved a coven who helped you instead of hurt you, who did everything they could to understand your powers not be afraid of them, and I’m sorry that you never had that,” Lilia tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I… thank you,” Agatha says, turning away from Lilia so that the older woman doesn’t see the tears in her eyes, and the two of them drift into silence as they stand together, Lilia knowing there is something else she wants to offer Agatha, but as she doesn’t want to overwhelm her she doesn’t make the offer, and instead just makes a note of it so that she can make it at a better time.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Agatha is with Lilia Nicky had walked over to his mom, who is watching everyone from a distance like she tends to do, and once he is close enough, he sits down with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Rio asks her son, as she knows the time of the Road has been rather intense, and because of that she wants to make sure he is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky responds. “Mom, I destroyed a ghost,” Nicky says to her, still feeling rather amazed by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did I destroy a ghost?” Nicky asks, as that is something he is still confused about.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m still tyring to figure that out,” Rio admits. “Why don’t you tell me what happened,” Rio suggests, feeling that Nicky’s explanation about what he did could give her son real insight into what happened, and maybe help her figure it out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, so I already had my knife in my hand, just in case, figured it was the smart choice,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was,” Rio confirms, feeling glad that he had enough sense to do that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, that became clear,” Nicky admits. “I wasn’t even thinking about what I was doing,” Nicky admits. “All I knew is that Evanora was flying towards me, she was going to possess me again, and I couldn’t let that happen, not again,” Nicky reveals, and as he does Rio notices exactly what he said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Again?” Rio asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was how I got below the Road, she possessed me and threw me into the swamp,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, I’m so sorry that happened,” Rio tells her son, adding that to the list of many, many, reasons why she hates Evanora Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wasn’t as bad as hearing her talk about mama,” Nicky admits, clearly pained about that, and because she knows Evanora Rio can guess just how awful that would have been. “The things she was saying….” Nicky starts to say, before trailing off. “I knew that if she had another chance, she was going to use me to hurt Mama, again, and I wasn’t going to let that happen,” Nicky admits. “So, when she came towards me, I just stabbed,” Nicky explains. “At first, I didn’t think anything happened, but then I felt my magic, felt it encircle the blade, and spread through her, and then she was gone, and I was blown backwards,” Nicky explains, and as he does Rio considers what her son said so that she can make sense of things.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was both parts of you that allowed you to destroy her,” Rio realises. “The magic you got from me, and the magic you got from Mama,” Rio realised. “It combined with your heart, the desire you had to protect your mama, in a way so uniquely you to do the impossible,” Rio admits. “I’m so proud of you,” Rio tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Mom,” Nicky responds. “Mom, the things Evanora was saying to me about Mama, she said them to mama before, hadn’t she?” Nicky asks, wanting to know, but not wanting to cause his Mama more pain by asking her directly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably,” Rio says, as while she can’t be sure without knowing exactly what Evanora said also knows enough to know that anything Evanora said to Nicky she likely said to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s awful,” Nicky says, growing.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s Evanora,” Rio responds simply.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it now, why you never talked about it,” Nicky admits. “She doesn’t deserve our thoughts, our energy, Mama does,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she does,” Rio says, as she notices Agatha and Llia walk back into the clearly. As they do Rio sees the look on Agatha’s face, the look she is trying to hide, and because of that she can’t help but feel concerned because she knows what it means. Due to knowing what the look means Rio is glad when Agatha walks straight over to them, and sits down with them. “You okay?” Rio asks in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Later,” Agatha tells Rio, also in a quiet voice, as she wants to protect Nicky from what she is feeling. “So, birthday cake in bed, any other traditions I should know about?” Agatha asks curious, wanting to catch up on what she has missed out on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s not really a tradition, but I like cooking when Mom’s doing her job,” Nicky reveals. “Actually… I just like cooking, I do it a lot,” Nicky reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s really good at it,” Rio reveals, and Nicky smiles proudly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to know,” Agatha says, and as she does, she realises something. “Those baked goods at my house, you made them?” Agatha asks, as she assumes that made sense.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I brought you food whenever I could… usually when I made too much,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I also don’t have a bedtime,” Nicky says. “Mom lets me stay up as late as I want doing whatever I want,” Nicky says, and Rio laughs at that, as Agatha gives her a disapproving look.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true,” Rio assures Agatha. “But I appreciate you trying to pull that,” Rio tells Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Had to try,” Nicky says with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     “If we didn’t give Nicky a bedtime, he would stay up all night reading and then sleep in school,” Rio explains to Agatha, who suspects that that is such a specific detail that it likely happened, as while she is pretty lax when it comes rules bedtime is actually one, she usually tends to be pretty strict about, even if she makes exceptions for certain occasions.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to know,” Agatha admits. “So, I guess we can expect to have you try asking both of us the same thing so that you can get the answer you want,” Agatha realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, isn’t that exactly what you’d want me to do?” Nicky asks, looking between his moms, knowing them well enough to know that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio admits, and she is a little amused that Nicky realised that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which is why we’re going to make sure we are on the same page,” Agatha says, knowing that that is what they decided when Nicky was first born so it’s something they’ll continue.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is going to be fun,” Nicky says amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “You might want to remember you said that,” Agatha tells her son, as she doesn’t need Lilia’s powers to know that the day is gong to come where Nicky regrets being happy about his moms being on the same page.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure the two of you will remind me,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Agatha and Rio say together, and Nicky smiles, as this is what he has wanted every day for the last eight years, his moms to be together again, for the three of them to be together.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     While Nicky, Rio, and Agatha are off on their own talking, getting to finally spend some time together, Jen, Alice and Lilia are off on the other side of the clearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably get going to the next task,” Jen says to the others in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should, but do you want to be the one to tell them that?” Lilia asks, clearly referring to Agatha, Rio, and Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “We shouldn’t have to. They should know, we’re here for a reason, we shouldn’t put everything on hold because of them, it’s not fair, they should know that,” Jen says annoyed, and once she does Alice reaches out and puts a comforting hand on her leg.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, it will be okay,” Alice assures her, being able to tell that Jen is tensed because she is worried about what is going to happen. “So, how about we give them a few more minutes together,” Alice suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, but you have to be the one to tell them we’ve got to move on,” Jen tells Alice, though it is clear to Lilia that Alice’s touch has relaxed her a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal,” Alice responds.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she got the others to agree to a few minutes it is closer to ten minutes before Alice gets up and walks over to where Agatha, Rio, and Nicky are sitting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, so, we Jen, Lilia and I think it’s time for us to move onto the next trial,” Alice tells the trio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, probably is,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “This will be the last one right?” Nicky asks his moms. “So, when we exit it, we exit the road?” Nicky asks, knowing that they will know because of their previous experience.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we exit back onto the Road, and then walk a little more before our true exit will be revealed and we get what we want, what’s missing,” Agatha explains to her son, knowing they may face one more thing before then, but that is up to the Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says, as he, and both his mothers, standing up, as do Lilia and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     Once everyone is standing, they walk over to one another and once again, as a coven, they start to walk down the Road, Lilia feeling nervous about what her trial is going to be.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     So, considering how amazing Lilia’s trial was on the show I was extremely nervous about how to write it, so I hope you like what I came up with.
    </p>
<p>
     Thank you so much for the support. Hope you like this chapter, will post the next chapter in about 12 hours, then another chapter before I go to bed. Due to the fact that I have to go into the office on Monday I will only update one chapter Monday then post the last of the chapters on Tuesday.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     For a few minutes, or at least that’s what it feels like for them, after Nicky asked his moms what happened when they finish this task the group, the coven, continue to walk together, following the almost yellow path, until they finally see a structure in the distance. Exchanging looks the group continue to walk until they see just what the structure is.
    </p>
<p>
     “A castle?” Nicky asks surprised, as he certainly was not expecting that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Apparently,” Lilia says, feeling even more nervous, as she can’t imagine that means something good for her trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whenever you’re ready, we are too,” Alice tells Lilia in a reassuring voice as she remembers how nervous she was about her trial and because of that she completely understands if Lilia wants to take a moment before entering.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m ready,” Lilia says, and she takes a deep breath before taking the last few steps before getting to the door and opening it, walking into the castle with the others followed behind her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as she walks though the threshold of the castle Lilia sees a bright light and once the light fades away, she realises two things, the first is that she is completely alone, and the second is that she is dressed up as Glinda the Good Witch.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is so insulting,” Lilia mutters, but as she knows she cannot change that fact she doesn’t dwell on it.
    </p>
<p>
     As she can’t change what she is dressed at Lilia instead looks around the room and realises she is in what appears to be a chamber in a castle. Looking around the room she sees a stone table. Assuming the table has something to do with her task Lilia walks over to it and sees that there is a stack of tarot cards, seven spots that are clearly the right size for tarot cards, and each of the spots has words carved in front of them;
    </p>
<p>
     “The Goal, The Guiding Hand, The Soul, The Strength, the Heart, The Conscience, the Ultimate Destination,” Lilia reads, running her hand over each of the words. “Now what do I do?” Lilia asks, as it’s not perfectly clear what she is going to have to do; though she could make a few guesses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Has it been so long that you’ve forgotten?” A familiar voice says, and Lilia turns to the shadows where the voice is coming from.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s there?” Lilia asks, feeling both comforted and worried about what she hears.
    </p>
<p>
     “A reminder,” the voice says again and a person who meant so much to her, her Maestra, walks out from the shadows.
    </p>
<p>
     “A reminder? Of what? Of how I failed?” Lilia asks, as that is the first thing she thinks of when she sees her Maestra, how she failed her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of what you once were, and can be again,” her Maestra says, walking towards Lilia. “You just need to remember your lessons, your responsibilities, remember your craft…. Remember yourself,” her Maestra tells Lilia and even though Lilia has a thousand questions she doesn’t get a chance to answer them as her Maestra fades away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for another cryptic lesson,” Lilia says, though even if it was just for a few seconds, it means a lot to see her Maestra again; even if it did make her feel like a teenager again.
    </p>
<p>
     Turning back to the table Lilia realises what she needs to do, and because of that she picks up the first of the tarot cards.
    </p>
<p>
     “Queen of Cups,” Lilia reads. “Empathetic, intuitive, inner voice to be trusted,” Lilia recites, and as she looks between the cards, and the words on the table, it’s like everything falls into place and she knows exactly what to do. “The guiding hand,” Lilia says. “Me,” Lilia says before putting the card in the right spot.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as Lilia puts the card down, she feels the entire room sway, and a door appears, very similar to how the arches appeared during Rio’s trail, except her doors are old, almost familiar. Assuming that it is what she has to do to complete the task Lilia leaves everything on the table and walks through the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Walking through the door Lilia finds herself back in her past, a garden she spent a lot of time learning her craft in, and once again she sees Maestra sitting at a table where once Lilia spent a lot of time.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve taken the first step,” Lilia’s Maestra says to her, clearly well aware of what is going on.
    </p>
<p>
     “The first step to what?” Lilia asks, as she approaches her Maestra.
    </p>
<p>
     “To becoming who you’re meant to be, to becoming who you’ve have hid from,” Lilia’s Maestra says to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not meant to be anything,” Lilia says, as over the centuries she has come to believe that, come to believe that she is just a forgotten old woman.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure about that?” Lilia’s Maestra asks, giving Lilia a look which Lilia knows to mean ‘are you sure?’. “What card brought you here?” Maestra asks, in a tone that makes it clear that she already knows what Lilia is about to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “Queen of cups…. The guiding hand,” Lilia remembers. “Are you saying I have to guide the others?” Lilia asks surprised, as she tries to figure out what is actually being said beneath the clues she is receiving.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not saying anything, the universe is,” Maestra admits. “The question is whether you have the courage to embrace what you are being shown or turn away from it, again,” Maestra tells Lilia, who feels hesitant as she realises something.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I could handle losing everything again,” Lilia admits, as loosing her coven the first time broke her, destroyed her, and she isn’t sure she can handle that again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Death comes for us all,” Maestra tells Lilia. “You need to decide whether you a prepared to have regrets when your time comes,” Maestra tells Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “I already have regrets,” Lilia admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you really want to add more?” Maestra asks, and Lilia considers the words.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few moments Lilia and her Maestra are both silent as Lilia considers what she has been told, considers the implications and what it would mean, and after a few moments, just as Lilia comes to a a decision, a door appears again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see you’ve made your decision,” Lilia’s Maestra tells her. “You have an inner voice to be trusted, allow that to guide you, and those around you,” Lilia’s Maestra says, clearly wanting to give one more piece of advice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Lilia says, thanking her not just for what just happened, but everything the older woman has done for her, before heading back through the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Seconds after she walked through the door in her past Lilia finds herself back in the chamber she started in, and feeling a newfound confidence Lilia walks back over to the table and without hesitation picks up another tarot card.
    </p>
<p>
     “Three of Swords,” Lilia reads. “Heartbreak, sorrow, Grief,” Lilia recites from memory, looking between the cards, and the table, and as she does the answer comes to her. “Agatha… the soul,” Lilia says, as she places the card down, and just like the last time she placed a card down as soon as she does the room sways and another door appears, a door which, without even thinking about it, Lilia walks through.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As she finds herself on the others side of the door Lilia isn’t surprised to find herself in a location she doesn’t recognize, as considering what happened when she put down the tarot card that symbolised her, she has to assume that she is in a locations significant to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Trying to figure out exactly where she is, and assuming that she will find Agatha somewhere, Lilia looks around, and as she does, she realises that she is in what appears to be a cellar, or basement, and judging by some of the things she sees Lilia assumes it is a cellar from the late 1600s.
    </p>
<p>
     As she looks around Lilia hears sniffling, crying, and knowing exactly who it is Lilia heads towards the sound where she finds Agatha, who looks to be a teenager, huddled in a corner, blood on her face, in a dirty dress, clearly terrified.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Lilia asks, hesitantly, as she walks towards her, having no idea what the rules are, whether she can get hurt, but also knowing she doesn’t want to cause Agatha more fear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who…. Who are you?” Agatha asks in a scared voice, so different to the Agatha who Lilia has gotten to know, and truthfully it makes her incredibly uncomfortable to hear the infamous Agatha Harkness so afraid.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s me, Lilia,” Lilia says, walking closer, but stopping when she is several steps away from her, as she doesn’t want to overwhelm her more than she already is. “I’m a witch too,” Lilia says, it being the first thing she can think to say that may get Agatha to trust her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did my mother send you?” Agatha asks, bringing her legs up to her chest, clearly trying to make herself as small as possible, and as she does Lilia sees the bruises, both old and new, covering Agatha’s legs.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Lilia tells her, fighting back the feeling of being sick when she realises that some of the bruises that are on Agatha’s legs were clearly made by fingers. “I’m here to help you, Agatha,” Lilia tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do not deserve help,” Agatha says, sounding so sure of that, and Lilia can’t help but wonder how many times Evanora Harkness said those words to Agatha, and what she did to make Agatha believe her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you do,” Lilia assures her. “You deserve help, and support, you deserve love, and friendship, and family,” Lilia tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I am evil,” Agatha tells Lilia, clearly believing that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re not,” Lilia tells her. “You have magic you can’t control, but that’s nor your fault, you were never taught how to use it properly,” Lilia says. “If you’d let me, I’d like to try to tech you,” Lilia says, as while she can’t guarantee she is going to be able to help Agatha she wants to try.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mother is always saying I cannot be taught, that I cannot be good,” Agatha tells Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not true,” Lilia tells her. “Agatha, if you come with me, we can work together, I can help you,” Lilia says, suspecting that as soon as they walk out of the ‘cellar’ present day Agatha will be back with her. “Will you let me help you?” Lilia asks, sticking out her hand for Agatha to take.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment Lilia is sure that Agatha isn’t going to take her hand, something which isn’t surprising considering the trust issues Agatha understandably has, that she is going to stay lost in her past, but then Agatha reaches out and takes her hand. As soon as Agatha and takes Lilia’s hand the door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s for us, are you ready to go?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Agatha says, struggling to her feet, and together with Lilia the two of them head out of the past together.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Just as Lilia suspected as soon as she and Agatha leave the task Agatha is herself, but she is wearing the costume of the Wicked Witch of the West.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you alright?” Lilia asks, as it is clear that Agatha has remembered everything that has just happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha responds, looking around, clearly not wanting to talk about what they just experienced. “Where are the others?” Agatha asks, wanting to see Nicky and Rio especially, but she is also a little worried about the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not sure, but I think I think we are gong to come together one at a time,” Lilia admits, as that is what makes sense. “Agatha, I meant what I said, I will do everything I can to help you gain control of your ability; to give you the help, mentorship, you should have gotten a long time ago,” Lilia tells Agatha, wanting to make that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah… thank you,” Agatha responds, having no idea how to feel about that, still feeling like she doesn’t deserve that. “We should probably get the next person back,” Agatha says, hoping it will be either Nicky or Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we should,” Lilia says, and she walks back over to the table and picks up another tarot card. “The Knight of Wands,” Lilia reads “Full of fire, Fights Bravery,” Lilia says, looking at Agatha as she speaks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice,” Lilia and Agatha say together, both realising who that description fits.
    </p>
<p>
     “The strength,” Lilia says, as she puts the card down, and just like every other time she has put a card down the chamber sways and a door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that for you? Or for both of us?” Agatha asks, knowing that it is Lilia’s trial, so it would make sense if it is just for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Both, we need to do this together,” Lilia says, as she knows that that’s one of the lessons she is being taught, that she cannot do everything alone, that she doesn’t have to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then lead the way,” Agatha says and together she and Lilia walk through the door, neither knowing what they ae going to be facing on the other side, but knowing that whatever it is they have to help Alice face it, just like Lilia helped Agatha.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After walking through the door, it takes both Lilia and Agatha a few seconds to realise where they are, but it quicky becomes clear that they are outside a hotel fire; leading both Lilia and Agatha to realise where, or more specifically, when they are.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got to find her,” Agatha says, trying to hide the panic in her voice as she knows what the Alice of this time would be going though.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Lilia says, and the two older witches quickly start to look around, looking for any sign of Alice. “There!” Lilia says, seeing Alice sitting alone, a way from anyone else, with a body bag next to her when a person who both Lilia and Agatha realise is a part of Alice’s mothers bad, walks over to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, we’ve got another hotel if you’d like to come with us,” the band member says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine,” Alice responds, and both Agath and Lilia recognize signs that tell them that she is trying to hold it together, that she isn’t wanting to be seen falling apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure? We’ve got plenty of room, your mom…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is gone,” Alice says, an edge to her voice. “I want to be alone,” Alice says, causing both Agatha and Lilia to exchange looks, as they very much doubt it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” the band member says. “Here’s a card, if you change your mind,” The band member says, and Alice takes it without a word. “I’m sorry, Alice,” The band member says, before walking away.
    </p>
<p>
     After watching the band member walk away Agatha and Lilia exchange looks, and realising what they need to do they walk over to Alice and sit down next to her, Lilia sitting next to her and Agatha sitting down next to Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why won’t you people leave me the hell alone, I want to be alone,” Alice says annoyed, both Liila and Agatha being able to see through the cracks which tell them she is barely holding it together.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you don’t,” Lilia says, and Alice turns to look at her with an angry look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “How the hell do you know?” Alice asks angrily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I’ve been you, we both have,” Lilia says. “So afraid of losing someone else, or being betrayed, that you don’t let anyone close because you figure it will be easier,” Lilia says to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t it?” Alice asks, as that’s what she assumes.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Lilia, and to Lilia’s surprise, Agatha, say.
    </p>
<p>
     “It just makes you lonely,” Agatha says, clearly speaking from her own experience.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can convince yourself that you don’t need anyone, that you can’t count on anyone, because you think it’s easier, but it’s not; it just makes you hurt in a different way,” Lilia admits. “No one is meant to go through life alone, and you don’t have to, Alice,” Lilia tells her. “You have people, a coven, a family, who want to be there for you, you just have to let us,” Lilia tells her. “You are incredibly strong, brave, full of fire, but the thing about fire is it burns when left alone; don’t let it burn you, let us in, let us be your coven,” Lilia tells the younger witch. “You don’t have to be alone anymore,” Lilia tells her, and for a few moments she isn’t sure her words have gotten through to Alice, but then they see a door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s our way out,” Agatha says. “You coming Alice?” Agatha asks, knowing that as hard as she and Lilia may try it ultimately has to be Alice’s choice to accept what they are saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where to?” Alice asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “To where you don’t have to be alone,” Lilia answers.
    </p>
<p>
     “A place like that exists?” Alice asks, almost like she can’t quiet believe that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It does,” Lilia says, standing up, and just like she did with Agatha she sticks out her hand for Alice to take, which she does.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Alice has taken Lilia’s hand Agatha stands up too, and together the trip head through the door together.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Seconds after they left Alice’s past Lilia, Agatha, and Alice who is now dressed as Morgan Le Fey, find themselves in the chamber once more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you mean it?” Alice asks Lilia, once she realises where they are and what has happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Every word,” Lilia responds, and she isn’t at all surprised when Alice glances at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio and I already agreed that we’re going to look out for you when we get out of here,” Agatha says, and while it is clear that both Lilia and Alice are surprised by that it is equally as clear that they are both very glad to hear that. “You’re not getting rid of us, Kid,” Agatha assures her, as while Alice isn’t actually that young, compared to how old Agatha, Lilia, and even Jen, she is.
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing the words, looking between the two older women, older witches, standing before her Alice feels what she hasn’t felt since her mother died; looked after. Looking between Agatha and Lilia, and knowing it applies to Rio too, Alice realises that while she has lost her mother, and no one can every completely replace her, she has people who will look after her, want to care about her, be there for her, just like her mother would if she could, and that is something she long ago accepted she would never have again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Alice says before walking forward and hugging both Agatha and Lilia hug at the same time, and together three witches who have been alone for a long time, who long ago forced themselves to believe that they are better off alone, realise that they don’t have to be alone anymore; they just need to find the courage to believe that.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support you give I so very much appreciate it. I will be posting one more chapter tonight, then tomorrow I will post one chapter in the afternoon before posting the last two chapters on Tuesday my time (Australia)
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea how long they have been holding each other, as time seemingly fades away, Lilia, Agatha and Alice allow them to feel what they long ago accepted they didn’t need, that that they believed they didn’t want, but then Lilia realises that they need to continue going.
    </p>
<p>
     “We need to get the others,” Lilia says looking between Agatha and Alice as they break apart. “We need them too,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “And they need us,” Alice realises, and Lilia nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s your show, Lilia, we’re here for support,” Agatha says, as that has become perfectly clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Lilia says, feeling incredibly grateful for that, and she once again walks over to the table, Agatha and Alice doing the same and standing either side of her, offering her silent support.
    </p>
<p>
     Once at the table Lilia once again picks up another card, and this time the one that she picks up is upside down. “The tower… reversed,” Lilia explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “What does that mean?” Alice asks, as while she doesn’t know a lot about tarot, she knows that a card being reversed changes the meaning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Upright it means disaster, destruction, sudden upheaval,” Lilia reveals, looking at Alice. “But when it’s reversed it means miraculous transformation,” Lilia explains, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Agatha says, remembering what Lilia said to her and Rio earlier, and that makes her both worried about what is going to happen to her son, but also very interested to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Heart,” Lilia says, putting the card down in the right spot, and as soon as it is gone the room once again sways and another door appears. As they know exactly what they need to do the trio exchange looks and without a word head through the door, Agatha very much looking forward to seeing her son, even if she is worried about what kind of state she is going to find him in.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as they walk through the door Lilia, Agatha, and Alice are all incredibly confused, because they are back on the Road, but as they look around, they see Nicky digging Sharon’s grave, which tells them they are before they summoned Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t understand, why are we here?” Alice asks confused, and it is clear that Lilia is just as confused, while Agatha isn’t as she realises exactly why they would be brough to this particular time and place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky knew Sharon was going to die,” Agatha reveals, causing both Lilia and Alice to look at her, it being clear that both are surprised by that. “Because he’s Rio’s son he can sense when someone is going to die, only when there is no chance of survival, and he can sense when a lot of people have died in the same place,” Agatha explains, feeling that considering it is Lilia’s trial she needs to know that, but also not wanting to break her son’s confidence. “He’s struggling with that,” Agath admits, it being clear that she doesn’t like that her son is struggling, but she isn’t completely sure the best way to help him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see,” Lilia says, and without waiting for the others she walks over to where Nicky is digging the grave. “Nicky,” Lilia says, and she isn’t surprised when he looks at her with a look of complete shock on his face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia? You know who I am?” Nicky asks shocked. “How?” Nicky asks, as from his perspective the Sigil is still in place.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not from this moment, I’m from a little way in the future,” Lilia says, feeling that is the best way to explain, and considering the circumstances, and she figures that considering how he’s grown up Nicky likely won’t been too overwhelmed with the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     “We all are,” Agatha says, causing Nicky to look at her and realise just who is with Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama?” Nicky asks amazed, as for him this is the first time his mother knew who he actually was since he was seven.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Sweetheart,” Agatha says, smiling back at him. “We’re here to help you,” Agatha assures him, and as she does Nicky looks between the grave he is digging and the three people standing before him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you know what I did?” Nicky asks, clearly nervous, clearly worried about what they are going to say, and think of him.
    </p>
<p>
     “We do,” Agatha says, even if technically only she does. “She was going to die anyway, there was nothing you could do to change that, you brought her some peace,” Agatha tells her son, causing the pieces to fall into place for Lilia and Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t feel like peace,” Nicky admits. “I really hate this ability,” Nicky admits, as he hates that he knows when people are going to die and there is nothing, he can do to save them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I understand,” Agatha tells her son, as while she does understand she also knows it’s something she never, ever, wanted for him.
    </p>
<p>
     “So do I,” Lilia assures Nicky. “Nicky I’ve been where you are, I know what it’s like to know tragedy is coming and be powerless to stop it,” Lilia tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you handle it?” Nicky asks, as right now he doesn’t think he is going to ever be able to handle it.
    </p>
<p>
     “For a long time I didn’t,” Lilia admits, feeling that it is important to tell him the truth. “I shut it down, buried that part of myself…. And I lost myself because of that,” Lilia says, taking a step forward. “I’m telling you this because I don’t want the same for you,” Lilia tells him. “No good comes from hating apart of yourself, of being so ashamed of yourself that you lose yourself,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s right, trust me on that,” Agatha says to her son. “Nicky, I know your ability to sense death is painful, and maybe even frightening, but it’s also apart of you, apart of you that you need to learn about, understand, embrace,” Agatha tells her son, saying to him what she wishes someone, anyone, had told her when she was Nicky’s age.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I don’t know how?” Nicky asks, looking between Lilia and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then we’ll help you figure it out,” Liila tells him. “You’re at the beginning of your journey, of your transformation, don’t cut your journey short because it’s painful,” Lilia tells him. “You’re not alone, Nicholas,” Lilia tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “I forgot everything my mom taught me, pushed it all down, and I regret that, don’t be like me,” Alice tells Nicky. “We can figure this out, you just have to be wiling to try,” Alice tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, you are not alone, you are never alone,” Agatha promises her son. “Let us help you figure out what your abilities mean, and how to use them, don’t push them down; don’t be ashamed of them,” Agatha tells her son, wanting better for him than what she experienced. “Please don’t be that much like me,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I…” Nicky starts to say, but because no words can explain what he is feeling he walks over and hugs his mother tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha and Nicky hug Lilia and Alice watch on, and as they do neither are sure what they can do, but then they see the door appear, which tells them Nicky has come to a decision, he has decided to accept himself a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, the door,” Lilia tells her, and as she does Agatha breaks apart from her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m really proud of you,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks Mama,” Nicky says amazed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s get our of here,” Alice says, and together the group head back through the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As soon as they walk through the door Lilia, Agatha, Alice and Nicky find themselves back in the chamber of the castle. Just like the others Nicky has been transformed into a costume; in his case it is Maleficent.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Agatha asks her son concerned, wanting to make sure he is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Nicky says, though he isn’t completely sure. “Where are Mom and Jen?” Nicky asks, looking around and not seeing them.
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t got them yet,” Lilia explains. “This is a one at a time kind of thing,” Lilia explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess that makes sense,” Nicky admits, though he does really want to see his mom. .
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s see who we are getting next,” Lilia says, though she suspects that, because of who Rio is, that she will be the last, and she walks over to the table and picks up the next card, leaving two still in the deck. “The High Priestess,” Lilia reads. “Immense Spiritual Power, unable or unwilling to use it,” Lilia receipts. “The Conscience… Jen,” Lilia says, placing the card down, leaving the spots labelled the ultimate destination and the goal left to be filled.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess we walk through that,” Nicky says when the room sways and a door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Alice confirms, as Lilia heads to the door and the others follow behind, Agatha making sure to stay close to her son as she wants to make sure he is okay, as they go.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Just like all the other times before as soon as they exit the door the group find themselves in a different location, this time on the outskirts of a town that Agatha recognizes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is she? Where is Jen?” Alice asks worried, as she looks around and sees no sign of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Over there, behind the trees, trying to hide from the villagers,” Agatha explains, knowing that, and no one questions how she knows that they just follow what she said.
    </p>
<p>
     Just like Agatha said they would the group quickly finds Jen sitting alone, clearly upset, staring at her hands, only Agatha noticing the blade tucked into her sleeve, why she sits by the fire, which makes everyone, except for Agatha who already realised, suspect they know exactly when this memory is taking place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen,” Lilia says, in a gentle voice, as she approaches her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are you? What do you want” Jen asks in a frightened voice, as Agatha purposely takes several steps back as she knows that right now the last thing Jen, from this time period, needs is to see her.
    </p>
<p>
     “My names Lilia, I want to help you,” Lilia explains, feeling that that is the best place to start.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if I can be helped,” Jen admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can be, because you help others, because that’s who you are,” Lilia assures Jen. “Your magic is powerful, yes, but it’s not your only power,” Lilia tells her. “Your knowledge, your heart, the moral centre you have within you, that’s also powerful; you’re powerful, even without your magic,” Lilia says, feeling that it is important that Jen all parts of herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want my magic back,” Jen admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Lilia tells her. “But before you get it back you need to accept that you don’t need it, that you’re powerful without it, and that it’s just one part of you,” Lilia tells Jen, as it is clear to her that while Nicky needs to accept the magical part of himself Jen needs to accept the non-magical part of herself; they both need to accept their whole selves, not just parts of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t know me yet,” Alice says, walking towards her. “But I think you’re pretty incredible, and I don’t know you with your magic,” Alice says, trying to help. “I can see how incredible you are, you need to see it for yourself,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know you, and I’m meant to believe you?” Jen asks, feeling doubtful about that, and because of that Agatha knows what she has to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “You do know me,” Agatha says, taking several steps forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Jen asks shocked, it being clear that Agatha is the last person she expected to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “The one and only,” Agatha says. “Look Jen, I may find you insufferable, but even I know that everything that is being said is true, and you should listen for once,” Agatha tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need to accept all of yourself Jen,” Nicky says, saying the same things Lilia said to him, feeling that Is the best thing to say considering what his Mama just said.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s the only way for you to understand where your magic fits within you, not how you fit your magic,” Lilia tells her, feeling that that is an important distinction.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never thought about it like that,” Jen admits. “But I’ll try to,” Jen admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the best any of us can do,” Alice says, giving her an encouraging look, and as she does the door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that?” Jen asks, referring to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your future,” Lilia says, offering her hand to Jen, who takes it and the group once again head through the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Just like every time everyone has returned to the room they have turned back into their costumes, which in Jen’s cast is the Evil Queen from Snow White.
    </p>
<p>
     “Serious? What are with the costumes?” Jen asks annoyed, as she looks at not only hers, but the ones the others are wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t ask,” Lilia responds, clearly annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s time for Mom now, right?” Nicky asks, as it is clear that he wants to see his mom again.
    </p>
<p>
     “There are two cards left, one is the goal, the other is the ultimate destination,” Lilia explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I can guess which one Rio is going to be,” Agatha admits, as out of those two options there is only one that make sense considering who Rio is.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so too,” Lilia says, walking over to the tarot table, and she picks up the second last card, and can’t help but laugh when she sees it. “Death,” Lilia says, showing the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “A bit on the nose,” Agatha comments, a little amused, as she knows it’s the exact kind of thing Rio would love.
    </p>
<p>
     “But no need for interpretation,” Lilia says, as she places the Death card in the spot where the card for the Ultimate Destination goes, and just as they expected the room starts to sway, and a door, which they all walk through, appears.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Unlike every other time in this trial that the group walked through the door they don’t have to go far as they see Rio, clearly waiting, leaning up against a tree.
    </p>
<p>
     “Took you long enough,” Rio says, when she notices the group, it being perfectly clear that she has been waiting for them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You knew we were coming?” Jen asks, sounding a little surprised by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m an all powerful cosmic being… of course I knew,” Rio says, feeling that should be obvious, and Agatha smirks, as she always likes it when Rio makes it clear how powerful she is, though of course she loves ever single part of Rio. “Are you all okay?” Rio asks, trying to make it seem like she doesn’t care.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we’re okay,” Agatha assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio says, pushing herself off the tree. “So, Lilia, this is your trial, how do we get out of here?” Rio asks, looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “For the rest of us the door appeared when we accepted something, not just about ourselves, but about us as a collective,” Lilia realises. “What do you need to accept?” Lilia asks, and only Agatha recognizes the signs of Rio starting to become uncomfortable, as the group drift into a tense silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “That you’re allowed to care,” Nicky tells his mom, causing everyone to look at him. “Mom, you’re inevitable, all roads lead to you, nothing can change that, and because of that you’ve only allowed yourself to care about Mama, and Me... but that’s starting to change,” Nicky realises, as he seen that. “You need to give yourself permission to care, you need to tell yourself that it’s okay to care about not only me and Mama,” Nicky realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “When did you get so smart?” Rio asks her son, it being perfectly clear that both she and Agatha are proud of their son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve always been smart,” Nicky tells his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are, but Rio accepting that it’s okay to care, isn’t the only thing that needs to happen for the door to appear,” Agatha says, causing everyone to look at her, wondering what she has realised that the rest of them haven’t. “The rest of us need to accept that Rio’s job is something she can’t control, as painful as it can be when we lose someone, hating her, hating death, won’t help,” Agatha says, staring at Rio as she speaks. “It’s all of our ultimate fate, we all need to accept that, I have,” Agatha says, looking at Rio, and an understanding look passes between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio says, in a very quiet voice, as hearing Agatha finally say those words, hearing her finally accept that there are things she cannot change, means everything to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have no issues with you, except I do questions your taste in romantic partners,” Jen says, causing Agatha to roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did blame you, for what happened to my original coven… I don’t anymore,” Lilia admits, speaking quickly before a fight can break out between some combination of Agatha, Rio, Jen, and possibly Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “After last night we’re good,” Alice assures Rio, who gives a nod, as she realises that it means more than she would have expected it to hear that from Alice and Lilia, and as she realises that the door appears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s get out of here,” Nicky says to his mom, and the group once again head through the door that will take them back to the chamber.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As the group walk back into the chamber everyone is once again changed in the costumes, the one exception to that is Rio is changed into her ‘job’ outfit, except she has her regular ‘Rio’ face rather than the skull she usually has when she is in this particular outfit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why didn’t you get an insulting outfit?” Jen asks, seeing what Rio is wearing, and knowing that out of all of them she certainly has the best one.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who knows, I guess The Road decided that my work outfit is suitable,” Rio says with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re all back together now, so what do we do?” Alice asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is one more card,” Lilia says, walking over to the table. “Three of Pentacles,” Lilia says. “Collaboration, Community, Singular voices waiting to Harmonize,” Lilia says, as she puts the card down in the spot that says, ‘the goal,’.
    </p>
<p>
     The second Lilia puts the card down the entire chamber starts to shake, but unlike the previous times where it was just a gentle sway it is a violent shake, it’s like there is strong wind echoing throughout the chamber.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s the way out,” Jen realises, pointing to the door, as everyone struggles to get to their feet.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do we get there?” Nicky asks worried, as he isn’t sure if they are going to make it across the chamber.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just like the card says, we collaborate,” Lilia realises. “We work together; as one,” Lilia says, as she looks between the others and as she does, she sticks out her hand, which Jen takes, without hesitation, and Alice takes her hand, then Rio takes Alice’s, Nicky takes Rio’s, and Agatha takes Nicky’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Once everyone is hand in hand, they all, as one line, start to make their way towards the door. While they are fighting against the shakes, and they are barely able to move, the group are able to slowly make their way across the chamber, as they work as one, until they finally get to the to the door. Once they are at the door Lilia is able to gasp the handle, and using everyone’s weight, because they are working against they wind, they are able to pull the door, yank it open, and finally exit the final trial.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support. I am going to apologize in advance for the clifthanger this chapter ends on, especially because it will be a while before I can update the next chapter. Hope you enjoy it despite that. Let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Due to the force they used to pull open the door no one is surprised to find that they don’t have the smoothest exit and rather than walking out of the trial they tumble out in a way similar to the way they exited the first trial; which is pretty fitting considering everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Everyone okay?” Lilia asks, being the first one to get her bearings, and as she looks around, she notices that the road doesn’t have a specific colour, but rather it looks like it’s daytime, looks like everything is it’s right colour; a combination of all of them, a representation of how unified they have become.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think so,” Alice says as she helps Jen to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Jen confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’m good,” Nicky says, looking at his moms as he speaks as he knows they would be worried about him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Same,” Agatha confirms, feeling glad that Nicky is okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “I always am,” Rio assures the others as she looks over both Nicky and Agatha to make sure they are okay.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, is this it? we’ve completed all the trials?” Nicky asks, looking between his moms, as he knows that they have completed the trials before so they will know if this is what it is like when they are completed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Looks like it,” Agatha says, being able to tell that her powers haven’t come back yet, but knowing from last time that that won’t happen until they are close to leaving the Road, or even not until they leave it completely.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happens now?” Alice asks, looking between the others, wondering if they have some answers, because she doesn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     “We keep walking, and we’ll find the exit, The Road will give us our prizes, what we want most, as we leave,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about the Seven?” Nicky asks worried, as he knows that they are still a big concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can trap them here if we leave. They won’t be able to leave if we leave first,” Rio explains, knowing that because of who she is. “Can you sense them?” Rio asks Nicky, as she is sure that right now, they are against the clock, not against the Road but the Salem Seven, and Nicky closes his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re not close,” Nicky assures everyone after a few moments, and everyone hope they stay away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Which means we’ve got some time, so I need a minute,” Jen says, as after what she experienced, she needs a minute, and so she walks away from the others.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen!” Alice calls, feeling concerned, clearly about to follow her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me go,” Agatha says, having a suspicion what is going on with her, and because of that she follows Jen before Alice can; to everyone’s confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, anyone else have a bad feeling about that?” Alice asks concerned, as even after everything that has happened it is still perfectly clear that Agatha and Jen do not get along so she can’t imagine anything good happening from the two of them going off on their own.
    </p>
<p>
     “A little,” Lilia admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure it will be fine,” Nicky says, trying to be optimistic, but he is a little worried, and as he tries to reassure the others Rio, who gives her son a reassuring look, walks over to where Alice is standing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asks Alice, as she can tell that she is affected by what happened during Lilia’s trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Alice admits, though she isn’t completely sure. “It was just hard being back there, remembering what I felt,” Alice admits, reaching up and wiping a tear away, as while she knows it wasn’t real as she sat by the body bag her mother was once inside her she remembered what she felt when it was real. “Um, so Agatha said that you already agreed to look after me,” Alice says, clearly changing the subject as she really doesn’t want to go down that particular memory road, even with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “We did,” Rio confirms. “Agatha, Nicky and I haven’t talked about what we’re going to be doing when we leave The Road, how we are going to live, but what I do know is that we have a spare room at our Westview house,” Rio explains. “It’s yours if you want it, whenever you want it,” Rio offers, making it clear that it is Alice’s choice, but it will always be a place for her if she wants it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I… thank you,” Alice says amazed, not sure how to respond to that, not sure if she is going to take her up on that offer, but it means everything to her that Rio, and by extension Agatha, made the offer to her.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     As she knows Jen pretty well Agatha isn’t at all surprised to find that she has sought out water and is sitting by a creek, running her hands through it. After pausing for a moment to push down the annoyance that Jen is always able to bring out in her, as she knows it won’t do either of them any good right now, Agatha walks over to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leave me alone, Alice,” Jen’s voice says, without turning around, clearly having heard the footsteps, and Agatha isn’t at all surprised that she assumed Alice would be the one to follow.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not Alice,” Agatha says, and Jen quickly turns to look at her, the shock she is feeling being perfectly clear on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?” Jen asks shocked. “I really didn’t expect you,” Jen admits, feeling suspicious about what she is up to, as in her experience Agatha is always up to something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hove long have you known me? You should know by now that I always do the unexpected,” Agatha says, as she sits down on a rock near, but not too near, where Jen is.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell do you want, Agatha?” Jen asks annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     “So many things,” Agatha responds, and Jen rolls her eyes. “I thought you might want to talk about what you saw, from someone who was there,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “You? Talk?” Jen asks, sounding both shocked and annoyed. “Last time I wanted to talk, you slammed a door in my face!” Jen exclaims as she stands up.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was going through something,” Agatha says, in way of explanation, even though she knows It’s not much of one.
    </p>
<p>
     “You weren’t the only one!” Jen exclaims. “I was too, but of course you didn’t care because for you the world only revolves around Agatha Harkness!” Jen says angrily, and as she has heard a lot worse, including things she has heard from Jen herself, Agatha doesn’t take the words personally. “I came to you for help! I was desperate… and you threw me away… I had nothing left,” Jen says, her voice breaking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that why you had the knife?” Agatha asks, and Jen looks at her surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “You noticed that?” Jen asks, as she though it was pretty well hidden, she certainly did not expect Agatha to notice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, because I knew to look for it,” Agatha explains simply.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because you understood why I had it so close?” Jen realises, seeing Agatha in a new light.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Agatha confirms, a mutual understanding passing between them. “But when you bind yourself to death for all eternity a knife isn’t going to do much,” Agatha tells her, and while Jen has a million questions Agatha and Rio tying themselves together that isn’t what she is going to ask about as it’s not the conversation they are having.
    </p>
<p>
     “But you still used it,” Jen realises, knowing that without Agatha explicitly saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, but was careful, never let it get so close that Rio would be called. She was the last person I wanted to see after all,” Agatha admits, admitting what she hasn’t told anyone before.
    </p>
<p>
     “I felt so weak without my magic…. I still don’t know how he did it,” Jen admits, as she has spent decades trying to figure it out and she still can’t, as she sits down across from Agatha. “Why did you push me away?” Jen asks, finally asking the question she hasn’t asked for so because the time has come where she needs an answer, especially after her conversation with Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I don’t help people, Jen, I hurt them, you know that,” Agatha tells her, as Jen is one of the people she hurt, there being a sad certainty to Agatha’s voice which tells Jen that that is something she truly believes. “I knew how you felt when you first showed up, it was written all over your face, and while I never felt the same, I still used your feelings for my own goals,” Agatha admits, and that isn’t new information for Jen, she knows Agatha used her, so she doesn’t react to that. “I wanted to believe that I could have an actual friend, wanted to believe that my mother was wrong, and I didn’t corrupt everyone who came close to me, but then you showed up bound…” Agatha starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you thought you ruined me too,” Jen realises.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did encourage you to go to Boston,” Agatha reminds her. “I didn’t know what would happen, but it was still my idea,” Agatha explains, as at the time Boston was having a lot of mothers die in childbirth so she truly believed that they could use Jen’s skills, she believed that Jen could save the lives of mothers and their babies. “And between that guilt, and everything that came with having the Darkhold, when you showed back up, I thought it was better to push you away, and make sure you never came back,” Agatha tells Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were trying to protect me,” Jen realises, everything making a lot more senses, and she can’t help but wonder if that is what Lilia realised as that would make sense considering how the older witch reacted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seemed like the only thing to do,” Agatha says with a shrug, trying to make it seem like it’s no big deal, and for a few moments they drift into an awkward silence, neither overly sure what to say next considering the; incredibly personal, conversation they just had.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you just call me a friend?” Jen asks, wanting to make sure she heard right, and she figures it’s a good change of subject.
    </p>
<p>
     “More like an annoying little sister,” Agatha responds, and Jen picks up a couple of small pebbles which she throws at Agatha. “Very mature,” Agatha says, as she also picks up a couple of pebbles which she throws at Jen, who dodges them, causing both of them to laugh. “Jen, I had hoped that your anger at me would help you keep going,” Agatha admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It did, for a while,” Jen admits, and as she does another look of understanding passes between them. “We should probably get back, everyone else are probably worried we killed each other,” Jen tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio knows we haven’t, but you’re probably right getting back,” Agatha says, standing up. “We’ve got a Road to finish walking down, power to get back,” Agatha says, walking over to Jen and sticking out her hand for her to take.
    </p>
<p>
     “That we do,” Jen says, taking Agatha’s hand and once they are both standing up Jen looks at Agatha who looks between them, and an understanding once again passes between them, both of them knowing that their past is not forgotten, but understood.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Why Jen and Agatha are talking Nicky, who is trying to distract himself from worrying about just how their conversation is going as he can’t imagine it going well, has walked over to Lilia, who is sitting on a rock, and sits down next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Nicky asks curious, once he is sitting down too, as he knows it must have been intense for her to go through her trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what… for the first time in a long time I think I am,” Lilia admits, smiling with a newfound confidence, as for the first time, in a long time, she knows who she truly is, what she should be doing, and what she is apart of.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s awesome,” Nicky admits, being able to tell that Lilia is feeling better and that is amazing to see.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about you, Kiddo?” Lilia asks him, turning to look at him, waning to see just how he is doing right now as she knows that considering everything that has happened he has gone through a lot since they started to travel down The Road.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know,” Nicky admits, as he is still trying to figure that out, but figures being honest is best. “This whole thing was my plan, and even though the story of when my moms went down the Road last time was my favourite bedtime story, I didn’t expect it to be so… intense,” Nicky admits, having struggled to figure out the right word to use, and Lilia isn’t at all surprised to know that last time Agatha went down the Road Rio was with her, but she does question their judgement when it comes to telling Nicky the story of their journey down The Road as a bedtime story.
    </p>
<p>
     “Life has a way of surprising us… especially this place,” Lilia informs Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ain’t that the truth,” Nicky admits, as he looks around. “Lilia, how old were you when you first predicted tragedy?” Nicky asks curious, feeling very interested to know because he knows they have abilities that are similar.
    </p>
<p>
     “Young,” Lilia admits. “Probably around seven or eight,” Lilia explains, as she doesn’t remember exactly how old she was because it was so long ago. “What about you?” Lilia asks curious, though considering his current age she can’t imagine Nicky was too old when he first sensed death.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not long after I turned eight,” Nicky explains. “It was a bird at first, but then Mom and I went to London, and I touched someone, a random lady walking down the street, and I knew,” Nicky says sadly, knowing he will never forget what he felt in that moment. “For the four years that followed we moved so much that it didn’t happen much, but then when we got to Westview it happened a little more,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you didn’t know how to handle it,” Lilia realises, feeling that that is a completely understandable reaction, as it is certainly how she reacted.
    </p>
<p>
     “I also didn’t want Mom to worry,” Nicky admits, and that doesn’t surprise Liila. “I avoided touching people when I could, it was easy, but then we got to The Road…” Nicky starts to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you felt it without touch,” Lilia realises, and Nicky nods. “Nicholas, abilities like ours, like your mama has, they can be a burden, they can make you feel like you’re carrying a weight around with you, but you what you need to know is that are not carrying that weight alone,” Lilia assures him. “You have your moms, and your coven; we’re going to help you,” Lilia assures him. “We’re going to figure this out together,” Lilia promises him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, Lilia,” Nicky says, feeling incredibly grateful towards her, as for so long it has just been him and his moms, and that was everything he needed, so he never though he would have more family than just them, but it is clear that the Road has given him just that, as Jen and Agatha walk back towards them.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, bloodshed, I’m a little surprised,” Rio admits, trying to lighten the mood as she can tell that whatever Agatha and Jen talked about was intense, even if she didn’t know exactly what it was that they talked about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Disappointed?” Agatha asks with a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s an answer I’m not going to give in front of our son,” Rio tells Agatha, showing that she does have some level of self-control, Agatha smirks at that, while Lilia, Jen and Alice exchange looks.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s just as bad as answering,” Nicky says, pulling a face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good luck living with those two, Nicky,” Jen tells Nicky, sounding amused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Appreciate it, I’m going to need a lot of therapy,” Nicky says, then he realises something. “Do witches have therapists?” Nicky asks, looking between the others, as he realises he doesn’t know that.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Lilia, Agatha, Jen, and Alice say together.
    </p>
<p>
     “That explains so much,” Nicky admits. “I’m really happy you’re back together, just try not to disturb me too much,” Nicky requests, as he looks between his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “No promises,” Agatha tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “But we’ll try,” Rio adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess that’s the best I can hope for,” Nicky comments, though he doesn’t have much hope.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, now that that is decided we should probably get going,” Alice tells the others, as she really doesn’t want to stay on the Road for longer than they have to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we really should,” Jen confirms, and the others nod.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing the nod Nicky and Lilia both stand up and the group once again continue their walk down the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, how long are we going to have to walk?” Nicky asks his moms, who he is walking between.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not sure, it will depend on The Road,” Agatha responds, Nicky nods and the group drift into silence as they group walk together.
    </p>
<p>
     For a little while, no one sure exactly how long, not even Rio, the group walk together down the road, occasionally engaging in conversation, but for the most part just walking. As they round a corner in the path the group sees something on the horizon, something which they all recognize.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s the exit,” Agatha says, smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re all so close,” Alice says, exchanging amazed looks with Jen, and without even thinking about it everyone in the group start to walk fast.
    </p>
<p>
     As everyone almost run towards the door Nicky realises something, something awful;
    </p>
<p>
     “STOP!” Nicky suddenly yells, and everyone stops and look at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky? What is it?” Rio asks her son as she pulls her knife, knowing her son well enough to know that that tone of voice doesn’t mean anything good.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re surrounded,” Nicky reveals, and as he does everyone else looks around, and realises that Nicky is completely right, they are surrounded by the Salem Seven with no way to get to their exit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fucken hell,” Agatha says annoyed, as she and Rio push Nicky into the middle of the group so that he is as protected as possible while the rest of them stand back to back, each of them facing a different directly, with Nicky in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha faces the direction that will allow them to leave The Road, the one that is blocked, and considers everything that is happening, who she is facing, and what an all out fight will mean Agatha knows exactly what she needs to do; that there is no only one option, and because of that she glances at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio says, her voice breaking, with a horrified look on her face, realising exactly what Agatha is going to do, as Agatha takes a step forward, causing Jen and Alice to move a little more to cover the gap she left to protect Nicky as they know the Seven are bound to want him too.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you let everyone else go you can have me,” Agatha says, looking at the ‘leader’ of the Seven, a witch named Vertigo, who is the one who is blocking their way out, their way to safety.

     Chapter 35
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     I am so sorry about the cliffhanger. I hope this chapter makes up for it. last two chapter will be up tomorrow, first of which in like 13 or so hours depending on when I wake up. Please let me know what you think.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “Mama no!” Nicky exclaims, trying to move forward but Rio grabs hold of his arm, preventing him from moving, needing to protect him, Nicky knowing that after everything that has happened, everything they have done, he cannot lose his mother now.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what you want isn’t it? your revenge?” Agatha asks, ignoring her son’s words even though the desperation in his voice breaks her heart. “Keeping me from my son forever, from the love of my life… from my coven,” Agatha says, her voice stuttering as she says the last few words as while she knows deep inside that that’s what they are actually admitting it out loud is big for her. “Isn’t that the perfect revenge?” Agatha asks, as considering what she did to them from their perspective it would be the perfect punishment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha we’re not going to leave you!” Lilia tells her, knowing that not that long ago this would have been a sacrifice play she would never imagine Agatha making.
    </p>
<p>
     “If Vertigo agrees, you are,” Agatha says in a stern tone of voice, Lilia’s words being the exact kind of thing she never though she would deserve, but she doesn’t allow herself to focus on that, instead she just continues to stare down Vertigo, knowing better than looking away from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Jen says, feeling that despite her issues with Agatha that’s not something she can let happen.
    </p>
<p>
     “No way!” Alice exclaims, and as she feels how much her Coven care, how much they support her, something which her mother made her long ago believe she would never have, Agatha feels a sense of peace within herself; something which she has never felt before and which tells her that she is making the right decision.
    </p>
<p>
     “No tricks, no lies, you have my word, you let everyone else go, unharmed, and you’ve got me,” Agatha says, needing to make it clear that there is no deal if everyone else isn’t unharmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, do you really think we’re going to let that happened?” Jen asks, showing how far they have come since Agatha’s trial.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to,” Agatha tells her, as right now she doesn’t see another option, not when they are outnumbered, not when she and Jen don’t have their magic back yet, not when Rio is limited in the ways she can fight, and as his mother speaks Nicky realises something; something which he knows is critical.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama and Jen have their magicks back,” Nicky says to his mom in a quiet voice, soo quiet that only she hears, and hearing her sons words Rio smirks, knowing that the tide just moved in their favour and knowing exactly what they have to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m about to yell something to Agatha, once I do blast the members of the seven and run towards the exit, run as fast as you can, do not look back,” Rio uses her magic to say into the minds of Nicky, Jen, Lilia, and Alice, using an ability she doesn’t like to use, one that doesn’t work on Agatha, but considering everything she sees no other option, while all four of them are confused about what she just did, and how she did, it they all trust Rio and because of that they all decide to just go along with her plan. “Agatha, Puerto Rico!” Rio exclaims.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as she hears Rio’s words Agatha knows exactly what they mean and because of that, being able to feel her magick coursing through her, Agatha sends a blast of strong purple magic towards Veticio, throwing her off the Road. At the same time Agatha sends a blast of purple magic Nicky, Alice, Lilia, Jen whose returned magic is pink and Rio, who isn’t prevented from doing so, all send strong blasts towards the other members of the seven, blasting them all backwards.
    </p>
<p>
     “RUN!” Agatha exclaims, and the entire group start to run, all trying to get to the exit as they know it’s their only hope.
    </p>
<p>
     As they run Rio, Agatha, and Alice, also send several blasts towards the other members of the seven who are still following them, all knowing that every second counts, and that all they have to do is stay in front of the seven until they get to the exit; something which is seemingly becoming more difficult with every moment that passes.
    </p>
<p>
     While the group run it is perfectly clear that they are all trying to make sure Nicky is okay, that they are trying to protect him, but because he gets an idea, knowing his own abilities and that he doesn’t need anyone’s protection Nicky pauses, as the others keep running.
    </p>
<p>
     “DON’T STOP!” Agatha tells her son, seeing what he is doing, feeling terrified, and Nicky ignores her and uses his magic to produce a shield, that forms just where Agatha, Rio and Alice just were, to temporarily block the seven as it looks like a half circle, making it so there is no way around it. “Go, go, go!” Agatha tells her son, feeling proud of him but also terrified for him as she knows the Seven is after him too, grabbing his hand, as they all keep running.
    </p>
<p>
     Less than a minute after Nicky produced a shield, which the seven are currently trying to get through, but they find themselves unable to because of the strength, the group get to the door that will lead them out of The Road. “Go! We’re right behind you!” Agatha tells Alice, who is the first to reach the door, as she turns to look back to see how far behind the others are.
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing Agatha’s words Alice hurries through the door, followed by Jen, Nicky, who looks back at his moms wanting to make sure they are right behind him, Lilia, Rio and finally Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Close it, close it, close it,” Agatha says, as she runs through the door and into her basement, knowing that their only hope is to leave the Seven trapped on the Road, and with some difficulty Jen, Alice, Nicky and Lilia manage to get the door closed, sealing off the road, and trapping the seven there; Rio knowing without a doubt that they will not be able to escape.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that it? we, did it?” Nicky asks, feeling amazed, as he looks between the others, feeling complete disbelief that they actually managed to pull it off.
    </p>
<p>
     “We did it,” Agatha says, walking over to Rio and Nicky who she hugs at the same time, feeling amazed that they are all back together, and more amazingly, that they are safe, aware of who they are, and unharmed.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha, Rio, Nicky embrace Alice, Jen, and Lilia do the same, all feeling beyond amazed and thrilled that they succeeded. As everyone breaks apart Nicky hugs Alice, Jen, and Lilia while Agatha and Rio kiss, and once they break apart Agatha and Rio are hugged by Alice, Jen and Lilia.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, what do we do now?” Nicky asks curious, once everyone has stopped hugging, knowing that he planned everything else, what he didn’t plan is what happens now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever we want, we’ve all gotten back what we need,” Lilia tells the others, knowing that while she thought she went down the road to get her power back what she actually wanted is what she has gotten, a coven, a family.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I think we all could use a drink,” Rio suggests. “I’ve got several bottles at home if anyone is interested,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely,” Alice says, without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think right now I just want to go to bed,” Jen admits. “Raincheck?” Jen asks hesitantly, as she isn’t completely sure that she will be wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Open invitation,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take you up on that another time,” Lilia says, as like Jen she just wants to go to bed, because after everything that has happened, she is feeling exhausted in every sense of the word.
    </p>
<p>
     “No problem,” Rio says, as she walks over to where Agatha is standing with her arm around Nicky. “So, I know we’ve got a lot to figure out, but Nicky and I have always considered our home to be your home; are you ready to come home?” Rio asks, knowing that there is a conversation they need to have, but right now she just wants to take Agatha home.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely,” Agatha says, as she would be perfectly happy if she never has to step foot in this house again. “Let’s go home,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve got to find Señor Scratchy first, he has to come home too,” Nicky tells his moms, as while Agatha was under the spell he knew his rabbit had to stay with Agatha, but now the spell is broken he wants him back.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll find him,” Agatha assures him.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll help,” Lilia says, and the entire Coven start their search for the missing Rabbit.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     After a few minutes of searching the group manage to find Señor Scratchy, hidden in a kitchen cabinet, and once they have found him the entire Coven head outside where they find it is late at night.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have we been gone?” Alice asks confused, and Agatha turns to Rio, knowing she will know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Three days,” Rio answers, without even needing to think about it. “It’s ten twenty pm,” Rio admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to know,” Jen says, as they start to walk down the street together. “This is my car,” Jen says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Drive say,” Alice says before hugging her, and after Alice and Jen break apart Jen gives a hug to Nicky and Lilia as well, while just nodding at Agatha and Rio, before getting into her car.
    </p>
<p>
     After Jen drive away the others continue to walk, saying goodbye to Lilia on the way, before Nicky, who is carrying Señor Scratchy, Agatha, Rio, and Alice start to walk up the path and towards the front door of the house Rio and Nicky have called home for the past three years. As they walk towards the house Rio takes Agatha’s hand in a comforting way, as she can tell that Agatha is nervous, while Nicky hurries forward to open the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome home, Mama,” Nicky says to Agatha, smiling at her, as he opens the door, and they all walking into the house Agatha knowing that she doesn’t need a house to be at home, all she needs is Nicky and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad to be home,” Agatha says, once more putting her arm around her son, kissing the top of his head, as she looks around and takes notice of the house that is so perfectly Nicky and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Drinks are this way,” Rio says, leading everyone towards the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s also delicious baked goods and food,” Nicky says as he puts Señor Scratchy onto the ground and follows behind his mother, Alice and Agatha doing the same.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after they walked into the house Agatha, Rio, Nicky and Alice are sitting around the kitchen table, all three of them eating food Nicky had previously made while the three adults are drinking scotch and Nicky is drinking tea.
    </p>
<p>
     “You seriously made all this stuff?” Alice asks Nicky curious, as she finds the food amazing so is quite impressed with Nicky’s cooking skill.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, I love to cook,” Nicky assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should talk to Jen, you might find you really like potions,” Alice tells Nicky, knowing that they area similar skills so he might find that he likes potions more than he expected.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a good idea,” Nicky says with a grin, looking excited at the possibility.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really want to learn as much as possible, don’t you?” Agatha asks her son, seeing the look on his face and knowing what it likely means as she knows she has had the same look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really do,” Nicky confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, give me a few days to get used to everything, but once I do that, I can give you some lessons if you’d like,” Agatha says to her son, very much looking forward to the possibility, but she also doesn’t want to push Nicky into something he doesn’t want to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you kidding?” Nicky asks amazed. “That’s everything I’d like,” Nicky says, hurrying over to his mama and hugging her, a hug that Agatha gladly responds to as she feels like she is never going to get enough of hugging her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Agatha responds, as she breaks apart from her son, kissing his head before she does.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I might head to bed,” Nicky admits. “I’ll see you in the morning,” Nicky says to his mama.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you will,” Agatha says, as Nicky hugs Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, I might head to bed too,” Alice says, feeling a little awkward. “If that’s okay,” she says hesitantly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is,” Agatha tells her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky can show you where your room is,” Rio tells Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, Night Agatha, Rio,” Alice says to them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Night Mom, Mama,” Nicky says, smiling as while it is something very mundane for him it is everything he has wanted for a very, very long time, as he and Alice head out of the room, both Agatha and Rio watching them as they go, and once the two of them can longer be seen Rio reaches out and takes Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?” Rio asks Agatha concerned, as considering everything she wouldn’t be surprised if Agatha was feeling incredibly overwhelmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Still trying to figure that out,” Agatha admits, as she squeezes Rio’s hand, appreciating the fact that she is checking in. “So much has happened since you and Nicky broke that spell, in such a short amount of time,” Agatha admits, as now that they are off the road she is starting to comprehend everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “It has, which is why you take as much time as you need to figure it out,” Rio tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really, really love you, you know that?” Agatha asks, feeling that Rio’s kindness, her understanding is something she doesn’t deserve.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio tells her. “I love you too,” Rio responds, as Agatha takes a drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably talk about what we’re going to do now,” Agatha realises, after taking a drink. “You and Nicky have a life here,” Agatha says, as that became perfectly clear from the moment she walked into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “We do, one that we’ve always had a place for you in,” Rio assures Agatha, who smiles at that. “But considering everything I would understand if you wanted to leave Westview as quickly as possible, and so would Nicky,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what I want,” Agatha admits. “I do know that we need to do what’s best for Nicky, and he’s settled here,” Agatha admits, as while she really doesn’t want to stay in Westview she will if that’s what’s best for Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “He is, but Aggie if it’s too hard for you to be here he won’t want to stay, and I certainly won’t either,” Rio assures Agatha, calling her by her old nickname for the first time since Nicky died, as she won’t let Agatha willingly cause herself pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I need to think about it a bit more, and we all need to talk about it,” Agatha says, feeling that this isn’t a decision that she and Rio can make alone, they have to consider what Nicky wants.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like a good idea,” Rio responds, and as she does Agatha decides to ask something she is curious about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you and Nicky cast all the protections on this house?” Agatha asks, as she is ‘feeling’ something she can’t quiet place, something which she wants to understand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not quiet,” Rio admits, not surprised that Agatha realised now that she has her magic back. “After Wanda broke her spell there was still, what Nicky calls, magical interference in this whole area, we embedded it into the protection we cast,” Rio explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “You mentioned something about that on the Road,” Agatha remembers. “You used the interference to make it so this whole place off the grid, magically speaking,” Agatha realises, looking around, considering the implications of that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Rio confirms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh,” Agatha says, feeling curious about that, knowing she will look into it, but right now it’s very low down her list of priorities. “What about legally? Is this place actually yours?” Agatha asks, as she has some doubts about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s legal enough,” Rio says as it was the best way to keep Nicky safe. “And it’s ours, not just mine. Both our names are on the deed,” Rio explains, and Agatha is surprised by that.
    </p>
<p>
     “When you first moved in here you didn’t know if you’d be able to break the spell and you still put my name on the deed?” Agatha asks surprised.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I knew we weren’t going to give up, no matter what,” Rio assures her. “After I brought him back from the Veil, when we were searching for you, Nicky asked me if we’d ever have a real home, and I said when we got you back,” Rio explains, telling Agatha a lot about the life Rio and Nicky lived for the five years they spent trying to find her. “To me, and Nicky, it’s never been home without you, where we live doesn’t matter, as long as we are together,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling amazed by that Agatha puts down the glass she is holding and uses her magic to move Rio’s chair out from under the table. Once Rio is no longer confined by the table Agatha gets up and walks over to her, straddling her once she is close enough.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were my first real home,” Agatha says as she feels Rio’s hand’s rest either side of her waist. “You, and Nicky, are all I need to be home too,” Agatha says, before leaning forward and kissing Rio, a kiss that quickly becomes more heated, until Rio pulls back.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably move upstairs, I think we’ve traumatised Nicky enough,” Rio admits, knowing that the last thing they need is for their son, or even Alice, to walk in on what they are about to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “We really should,” Agatha admits. “It’s a good thing I haven’t forgotten a silencing spell,” Agatha says before leaning forward. “Because I want to hear you scream,” Agatha says, as he bites Rio’s ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Mi Amore…. I look forward to it,” Rio says, pulling Agatha down for a heated, violent, kiss, and as they do Rio teleports them upstairs as while she has never been able to teleport with Nicky she can with Agatha, something they have both taken advantage of in the past, and once they are in the bedroom Rio has spent the last three years imagining being able to share with Agatha, they spent several hours putting the strength of Agatha’s silencing spell to the test.

<strong>
      AN:
     </strong>
     Thank you so much for the support you have given this story, you have no idea what it means to me. So this is the penultimate chapter, the last chapter will be in about 12 hours, depending on how busy I am at work at 10.30pm tonight (I am working 4pm to 12am) so give me grace if it is a little late.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Even though she doesn’t sleep, even though she can feel the entire universe, Rio knows that there is no better feeling than laying in bed with Agatha peacefully asleep in her arms. As she holds her love, gently playing with her hair, Rio knows that this is as close to the human understanding of heaven that she’ll ever experience.
    </p>
<p>
     Due to knowing every little detail about Agatha, even after so many years apart, Rio realises the second Agatha goes from sleeping peacefully, to distressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, wake up Mi Amour,” Rio says, gently trying to shake her away, and after a few seconds Agatha bolts upright with a look of horror on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “MOM! NO!” Agatha yells, her voice full of pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay, Agatha, you’re safe,” Rio assure her, leaning forward and kissing Agatha’s shoulder in a specific place she knows calms Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ri… Rio?” Agatha asks, trying to get her barring, sounding like she is struggling to catch her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it’s me, Sweetheart, you’re okay, you’re safe,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky,” Agatha says, looking afraid, looking around and searching for him.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s okay, he’s asleep,” Rio assures her. “So’s Alice,” Rio adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need to check, where’s his room?” Agatha asks, clearly still panicked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Other side of the landing,” Rio answers, understanding that Agatha’s need to check on Nicky isn’t because Agatha doesn’t trust her, but because she needs to check for herself, as Agatha gets out of bed. “There’s t-shirt in the top draw,” Rio tells Agatha, and without another word Agatha walks over to the dresser and pulls out the first t-shirt she finds, one that just happens to be purple, and heads out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Following Rio’s instructions Agatha heads to the other side of the stair landing, passing two doors, and straight to the door that has ‘Nicky’ written on it. Getting to Nicky’s door, being as quiet as possible, Agatha opens the door and to her relief she sees Nicky fast asleep in his bed, completely okay.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she can tell that he is okay Agatha continues to watch him, wanting to make sure he is okay, and as she watches her soon Agatha hears footsteps she knows belong to Rio, who has put on a t-shirt of her own, walk up to her and once Rio is close enough she puts her arms around Agatha’s waist and lays her head on Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s okay, Agatha,” Rio assures her. “And so are you,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I needed to check,” Agatha admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I understand,” Rio assures her, as she has spent more than few nights watching Nicky sleep, as she kisses Agatha’s neck, and because she knows it is what Agatha needs, she just continues to hold Agatha as they watch their son sleep peacefully; something they do for almost an hour before heading back to their room.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea that his moms spent almost an hour watching him sleep Nicky gets up a little later than he usually gets up for school, but still relatively early, and heads down to the kitchen. As he figures it is the least he can do, and he wants the calm it gives him, Nicky starts to cook, planning on making breakfast but it turns out to be a lot more than just that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, something smells amazing,” Alice says as she walks into the kitchen, a while after Nicky started to cook. “And by something, I mean everything,” Alice admits, as she looks around and sees just how much Nicky has cooked. “Did you make breakfast?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Plus, lunch I think,” Nicky admits. “Did you sleep okay?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, surprisingly well,” Alice says as knowing what happened to her mother, that she isn’t alone anymore, gave her peace that she hasn’t had in a while.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Nicky says, looking glad about that, and before either of them can say anymore Agatha and Rio walk into the kitchen, Agatha wearing clothes that Rio had collected for her for when they broke the spell. “Mom! Mama!” Nicky says, looking thrilled to see them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, you really went all out,” Agatha notes, feeling very impressed with just how much her son has made.
    </p>
<p>
     “I may have gotten a little carried away,” Nicky admits. “But I’m sure it will all get eaten,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It definitely will,” Rio comments, knowing that. “So, have you already spoken to Eddie this morning?” Rio asks her son, assuming that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, we’re going to meet up after school,” Nicky admits. “Um, I was hoping he could come to dinner tonight, meet you,” Nicky says, looking at his mama. “If that’s okay,” He adds, as while he wants Eddie to meet his Mama, he only wants the meeting to happen if his mama wants it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is, I look forward to meeting him,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Awesome,” Nicky says, looking thrilled, not realising that he is going to very much regret his enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you have any other plans today?” Agatha asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just homework. I have some to catch up on,” Nicky admits. “But if you want to explore Westview, I can give a tour,” Nicky says, not sure how much his mama would remember about the town, and wanting to spend time with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I appreciate the offer, but I think I’ll stay around the house,” Agatha says, as she has no interest in exploring Westview, but the way Nicky phased the question tells her something big “You really like it here, don’t you?” Agatha asks, wanting to confirm what she suspects.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Nicky confirms. “But I also understand if we have to leave, if you don’t want to stay,” Nicky tells his moms, as he knows that for his mama this is a pretty traumatic place. “I don’t want to stay somewhere that causes you pain, Mama,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because you are pretty incredible,” Agatha says, walking over to her son and giving him a hug, feeling touched.
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t made any decision yet,” Rio assures her son. “We’re all going to talk about it a lot more, there’s some things we have to consider,” Rio says, as even though Agatha hasn’t mentioned it, she knows they also have to consider the fact that Agatha and Nicky have joined a coven; something which is good for both of them, and they shouldn’t dismiss that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Nicky says, feeling that that is fair enough. “Alice, what are you going to do today?” Nicky asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um not really sure, probably go see Jen at some point,” Alice says, purposely ignoring the knowing looks Agatha and Rio exchanged. “I’d like to come back here, after that, if that’s okay,” Alice says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is,” Agatha assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “As long as we’re here, you’ve got a room here,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Alice says, feeling incredibly grateful for that, and as she does Rio feels a familiar tug.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve got to go,” Rio says, and both Agatha and Nicky know why that will be. “I’ll be back when I can,” Rio says, walking over to Nicky who she gives a hug, and Agatha who she gives a gentle kiss to. “Te Veo,” Rio says, to Agatha, before heading out of the back door where she teleports away.
    </p>
<p>
     After Rio leaves Agatha notices the look on Nicky’s face, a look which he is clearly trying very hard to hide, and right away she realises what is going on;
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Agatha says, and Nicky looks at her. “She’ll be okay, back before you know it,” Agatha assures Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know… I just hate it when she’s gone,” Nicky admits, knowing that what he hates most is the uncertainty.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Agatha assures him, gently squeezing the arm she still has around him. “But how about we distract ourselves from that by eating all this amazing food you made,” Agatha suggests, it being the best distraction she can think of.
    </p>
<p>
     “We really should, everything smells incredible,” Alice says, recognizing what Agatha is doing and trying to help.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Nicky says, smiling slightly. “Okay, let’s eat,” Nicky says, and the three of them carry the food they made over to the table where Nicky, Agatha, and Alice have an amazing breakfast together, while it is clear they miss Rio it is equally clear that they enjoy getting to spend time together when they aren’t scared for their lives.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A while after he had breakfast with his mother and Alice, a breakfast that lasted a while, Nicky, who is carrying a tablet, has showed, done a little bit of homework, and is walking into the living room, searching for his mama, knowing that Alice has left, and his mom isn’t back yet.
    </p>
<p>
     As he walks into the living room Nicky can’t help but be amused by the sight that greats him as Agatha is sitting in the same spot, he found Rio countless times over the last three years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, talk about Déjà vu,” Nicky comments.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?” Agatha asks, turning away from the window to look at Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom sits there a lot,” Nicky explains as he walks over to her. “I lost count of the number of times I would find her sitting there, usually watching you,” Nicky admits, as he sits down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh,” Agatha says, not sure how to feel about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you watching for her?” Nicky asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, just watching,” Agatha says, as she wanted to make sure no enemies were coming, that no one was coming to hurt them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama, are you okay?” Nicky asks concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Getting there,” Agatha admits, as that’s the most honest answer she is willing to give her son, as she doesn’t want him to worry more than he already has. “It’s just a lot to know how much I’ve missed out on,” Agatha says, as she looks around at some of the photos that line the walls.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I’m feeling the same,” Nicky admits. “That’s actually why I came down,” Nicky admits, and Agatha giving him a curious look. “I know it’s not the same as being there, and you don’t have to watch if you don’t want to, but about a year ago I started to record videos talking to you,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did?” Agatha asks, feeling both surprised and touched.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, mom was borderline obsessive about taking photos for you,” Nicky reveals, and Agatha laughs at that. “So, I thought I would record videos of everything I wanted to tell you, about Mom, about Me, about what was going on with us,” Nicky explains.  “They’re all on this tablet if you want to watch,” Nicky says, offering the tablet, which Agatha takes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “No problem,” Nicky responds, then realises something. “Um, do you actually know how to use a tablet?” Nicky asks curious, as he isn’t sure if she would know how to.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, I know how to use a tablet,” Agatha tells her son. “I may be old, but remember not as old as mom, but I do know a little about technology,” Agatha assures her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to know,” Nicky says amused. “So, um, I need to run to the library if that’s okay,” Nicky says to his mama, as he knows his moms’ rules, which there aren’t many of, he doesn’t know his mama’s, and he doesn’t want to do something wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, it’s okay,” Agatha assures him, doing the mental working out in her head about how far the library is, and the quickest way there in case something happens. “Just make sure you have your knife with you,” Agatha requests. “The Seven are gone but we don’t know if anyone else have found us,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I always keep it with me, I know,” Nicky assures his mama before leaning forward and hugging her. “I love you, Mama, so much,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Agatha says, kissing the top of his head. “I’ll be here when you get home,” Agatha assures her son, as they break apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really will be,” Nicky says still amazed about that. “I’ll send a message to the tablet if I’m going to be gone longer than I expected,” Nicky says, feeling that that is the least he can do.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good idea,” Agatha tells him. “Go, have fun, don’t worry about me so much, okay?” Agatha says to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll try, but no promises,” Nicky tells her. “Bye Mama,” Nicky says before heading to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember your coat,” Agatha tells her son, realising that it is cold outside, and Nicky grabs his coat before leaving, Agatha watching him leave throughout the window.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Nicky is no longer in her field of vision Agatha turns her attention to the tablet, which she unlocks, and as she does, she sees that all the videos that Nicky recoded. Looking at the videos Agatha sees that they are sorted by the date they were recorded. After a moment of hesitation Agatha presses play on the first video, and just like she expected Nicky’s face fills the screen;
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, hi, Mama, today’s June 9th, 2025, you and Mom have been married for two hundred and seventy-one years, and we’ve all been in Westview for almost two years. Right now, you’re still trapped, buried beneath the Scarlett Witches’ spell, but if you are watching this it means that I finally figured out how to break it, and if that’s the case I really hope I figure it out soon; Mama I’m really sorry it’s taken so long, I’m really sorry I’ve let you down”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh sweetheart, you haven’t let me down, you never could, you have nothing to feel sorry for,” Agatha says, knowing she will have to tell actual Nicky as soon as he gets home.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know Mom is trying to remember everything about me so that she can tell you stories when we break the spell, well there are a few things I want to tell you about Mom. The first is, she loves you, so much, and she’s taken really amazing care of me, she’s trying to be strong, and do everything alone, but I know how much she needs you,”
    </p>
<p>
     Watching the videos Agatha has to fight back tears as she continues to watch her son talk, explain so many thigs she wishes she got to experience with him, and Rio. Even though it is painful for her Agatha continues to watch the videos as she wants to know everything that Nicky wanted her to know.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Having no idea that Agatha has been watching videos their son recorded for her Rio, who was gone longer than she wanted to be, is arriving back home. As she walks into the house, she notices Agatha sitting in the same spot she herself has sat in so many times.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re sitting in my spot,” Rio tells Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, I’ve been told,” Agatha says, turning to look at her, and as she does Rio notices the look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, what’s wrong?” Rio asks concerned, as she walks over to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you know Nicky’s recorded videos over the last year? Of things he wanted me to know?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “He never told me, but I realised,” Rio admits, as she sits down with Agatha. “You watched them?” Rio asks, as that’s what she assumes, and Agatha nods.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I am so sorry about causing you so much pain, about not being there when you needed me,” Agatha says, leaning forward.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, its okay, I’m okay,” Rio assures her, not wanting Agatha to carry around anymore guilt than she is already carrying. “You’re you again, we’re together, Nicky’s okay, you finally have a supportive coven, that’s all that matters,” Rio tells her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     “I never thought I deserved any of those things,” Agatha admits, looking down.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” Rio admits, reaching out and putting her hand against Agatha’s cheek, gently moving her face so that Agatha is looking at her. “But you do. You’re not who your mother made you believe you are, who you tried to make the world see you as; you Agatha Harkness are incredible, you are good, and you need to start believing that,” Rio tells her, as she feels Agatha lean into her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll try,” Agatha says, knowing it is going to be very difficult for her, and Rio leans forward and kisses her, a gentle kiss, and after a few moments they break apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is Nicky?” Rio asks curious, realising she should have asked that earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     “He went the library, but he messaged me saying he was going to meet Eddie and bring him here,” Agatha explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “I see,” Rio realises, checking the clock. “Which means we don’t have long,” Rio says. “You figured out how you are going to threaten him yet?” Rio asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet, I’ve got a few ideas,” Agatha says, and Rio laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, this is going to be fun,” Rio confirms, exchanging amused looks with Agatha, one she returns resulting in both of them breaking down in laughter before they start to discuss just what they plan for Nicky’s boyfriend.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A while after he left to go to the library, feeling incredibly nervous, Nicky is walking towards his house with Eddie by his side.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, your mom is well enough to come home?” Eddie asks, still trying to make sense of everything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep,” Nicky says, and he turns to look at Eddie. “Um, so you’re going to recognize her,” Nicky says, knowing that Eddie has seen ‘Agnes’ around town. “But you need to know that who you’re meeting tonight is who she really is, that the person you meet tonight is my mama. Who I’ve been trying really hard to get back,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Eddie says, feeling very confused. “I know you have trust issues, so I’m never going to push you, but when you’re ready to give it, I’d really like an explanation,” Eddie admits, as he has long accepted that there are things Nicky doesn’t talk about, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, you deserve one,” Nicky admits. “Just not tonight,” Nicky tells Eddie.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Eddie responds.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you for being so understanding,” Nicky says.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to thank me for that,” Eddie assures him, giving a smile. “We should probably head inside,” Eddie says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, guess we should,” Nicky says, and taking Eddie’s hand he heads into the house. “Mom? Mama?” Nicky asks, as both he and Eddie walk into the house and Nicky sees no sign of his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right here,” Rio’s voice says, and Nicky turns to see his moms walking down the stairs. “Hi Eddie,” Rio greats, with an over the top grin that even Nicky finds very creepy as it is very unlike his mom.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi… Mrs Scratch,” Eddie great, clearly nervous, and clearly recognizing Agatha, which is not helping with the confusion he is feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eddie, I’d like you to meet my mama, Agatha,” Nicky introduces, slightly stressing ‘Agatha’, feeling suspicious about what his moms are up to. “Mama, this is my boyfriend Eddie,” Nicky introduces.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eddie, it’s lovely to finally meet you,” Agatha says, sticking out her hand for Eddie to shake.
    </p>
<p>
     “You too, ma’am,” Eddie responds, clearly having no idea how to refer to Agatha as she squeezes his hand a little too tight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please, call me Agatha,” Agatha responds, and as she does there is a knock on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Didn’t we tell Alice not to knock?” Nicky asks confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “We did,” Rio assures him, walking to the door, knowing exactly why Alice knocked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Alice?” Eddie asks Nicky in a quiet voice, clearly confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky’s adoptive sister,” Agatha responds, having heard the question, and Eddie looks incredible confused about that as in all the time together Nicky has never mentioned an Alice, or a sister, as Rio opens the door and reveals not just Alice standing on the step, but Jen and Lilia too.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Nicky mutters, as he sees the trio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, hope it’s okay a couple more people join us,” Alice says, purposely not revealing that it was Agatha and Rio’s idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course not, the more the merrier,” Rio assures her.
    </p>
<p>
     “And it works perfectly because we just happened to order extra pizza,” Agatha reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t say,” Nicky says, looking between his moms and realising that it was their entire plan, to have Eddie interrogated not just by them but by the whole Coven. “Eddie, that’s Alice, and this is Jen, and Lilia my…” Nicky says, trailing off as he realises, he has no idea how to introduce them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Aunts,” Lilia supplies. “It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you,” Lilia says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, you too,” Eddie says, feeling more confused with every minute.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about we move this conversation into the living room, no point talking on the stairs,” Jen suggests.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good idea,” Nicky says, and everyone heads into the living room, Alice asking Eddie to tell them a little about himself as they go.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A little while after Nicky realised that it’s not going to be just his mothers interrogating, and scaring, Eddie but everyone he now considers family, the pizza has arrived and because of that Nicky has headed to the kitchen to grab plates and cups.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you alright?” Agatha, who has followed his son, asks as Nicky starts to collect everything they need.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicky assures her. “I just didn’t expect the entire family interrogation,” Nicky admits, and it fills Agatha’s heart to know that her son has entire coven of people who he considers family, that he isn’t alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “We couldn’t pass up the opportunity,” Agatha reveals, and Nicky rolls his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it, would have appreciated some warning, but I get it,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “No warning is what makes it fun,” Agatha reveals, and Nicky laughs a that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama… I may complain but this, you back, teasing me with my boyfriend, disturbing me with Mom, is everything I’ve ever wanted, everything I’ve ever wished for,” Nicky admits. “So even if I complain…. I don’t mean it, because this means… so damn much to me,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “It means a lot to me too,” Agatha assures her son, walking over to her son, who she hugs. “Nicky, I watched all your videos, and you need to know, you didn’t let me down, ever,” Agatha assures her son, wanting to make that clear.
    </p>
<p>
     “It felt like I did,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t, you never could,” Agatha assures her son, kissing his head before they break apart. “We should probably get back out there,” Agatha says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, who knows how everyone is traumatising Eddie,” Nicky says, honestly a little worried about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re all pulling our punches, promise,” Agatha tells her son.
    </p>
<p>
     “Appreciate it,” Nicky says, then he gets an idea. “You thinking what I’m thinking Mama?” Nicky asks with a smirk, as he makes his magick dance around his fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Definitely,” Agatha responds, and they both use their magicks to move the plates, cups, and drinks into the hands before heading back into the living room to join everyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     As Nicky walks back into the living room and re-joins his boyfriend, moms, and new family Nicky realises that he went down The Road to get his mama back and along the way he gained something he didn’t realise he wanted, didn’t know he needed, an entire family. While is moms have always, and always will be, more than enough for him it feels pretty incredible to know that they aren’t the only ones who love him, who will be there for him, no matter what.

<strong>
      October 31st 2026
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
     Three weeks have passed since Nicky and Rio broke the spell Agatha was under, and little over two weeks have passed since Agatha, Rio, Nicky, Alice, Jen, and Lilia returned from the road and ever since they have been doing their best to get used to the lives they gained; something which has involved all six of them still spending a lot of time together.
    </p>
<p>
     It’s a Saturday evening and Nicky, who is dressed in a black tuxedo, is in the kitchen of the home he, his moms, and Alice have been living in together since returning from The Road. Moving around the kitchen Nicky is checking, and double checking, that all the food, that is covering every surface in the kitchen, is perfect when Alice, who is wearing a dark maroon suit, walks into the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really did go all out,” Alice says, taking notice of everything Nicky has cooked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had to,” Nicky responds. “I had to make today as special as possible,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky, it’s already going to be special, there’s no need for you to put extra pressure on yourself,” Alice says, though she does understand why he has.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know… I just wanted to make it extra so,” Nicky admits, as he felt like he owed it to his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fair enough,” Alice responds, realising there is nothing she can say to convince Nicky he doesn’t have to try so hard. “So, is Eddie coming?” Alice asks curious, deciding a change of subject is best.
    </p>
<p>
     “He might come to the celebration later, but not the actual ceremony,” Nicky admits. “After he passed that whole group interrogation Mom and Mama said I could tell them everything but…” Nicky starts to say, before trailing off, as he avoids looking at Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not sure you’re ready?” Alice asks in a gentle tone of voice, having learnt over the last few weeks that sometimes Nicky need some gentle probing to talk about what is actually going on with him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Nicky says with a nod. “Especially when we still haven’t decided if we’re staying in Westview,” Nicky admits.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s fair enough, but take it from me, not letting yourself experience something that could be good for you because you’re worried about losing it is no way to live,” Alice advises, as there is a knock on the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll remember that,” Nicky says, putting down what he is doing and heading to the door, Alice walking behind him, and when get to the door Nicky opens it to reveal Lilia wearing a beautiful yellow robe. “Lilia, we told you didn’t have to knock,” Nicky reminds her as he greats her with a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s impolite not to,” Lilia responds, as she breaks apart from Nicky and walks over to Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio started a food fight last night and Agatha escalated it, I don’t think either of them care about being polite,” Alice reveal, though she has to admit it was fun.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course they did,” Lilia says, not overly surprised as she hugs Alice. “Seems like you did a good job on the clean up,” Lilia says, walking into the living room, as she looks around and notices how clean the house appears as there is no signs that any kind of fight happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “We used magick, the clean-up was more fun than the fight,” Nicky reveals, though he did love seeing both his mothers so carefree.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you think that,” Lilia says amused. “And just where are your mothers?” Lilia asks Nicky as she realises, she doesn’t see either of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama’s upstairs getting ready,” Nicky explains. “Mom is doing her job, but she swears she will be back in time,” Nicky explains.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s cutting it close,” Lilia notes, taking notice of the time.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, I said the same thing, but she promised she would be back in time,” Nicky admits, starting to feel nervous that she isn’t going to be.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think we have anything to worry about,” Alice says, noticing the look on Nicky’s face. “Even Rio has enough self-preservation not to risk Agatha’s retribution by being late for this,” Alice admits, knowing that Rio missing the ceremony, even for her job, will be a disaster and that she wouldn’t want to be within a ten-mile radius of the conformation between Agatha and Rio that would result from that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to know,” Lilia says and as she does the doorbell rings.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll get it,” Agatha’s voice responds, and moments later she walks down the stairs wearing a dark purple princess style dress, with her hair down. Once she is at the foot of the stairs she walks over to the door and opens it to reveal Jen wearing pink dress similar to the one she wore on The Road. “Hi Jen,” Agatha greats.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, Agatha, you really couldn’t go with something a little more traditional?” Jen asks, taking notice of what Agatha is wearing, as she walks into the house, closing the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “When have you ever known me to do something traditional?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good point,” Jen admits. “Still not overly sure why you’re doing this, you’re already married, in like multiple different ways,” Jen reminds Agatha as they walk towards the living area.
    </p>
<p>
     “True, but we’re not legally married, and we wanted to be legally married in front of all of you,” Agatha explains, as being able to be legally married is something she and Rio spent a long time not believing would ever be possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it technically legal when neither of you actually exist?” Jen asks curious.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course it is,” Agatha responds, starting to feel annoyed. “Can’t you just shut up and celebrate with us?” Agatha asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can celebrate, but I’m not going to shut up, and you wouldn’t want me to,” Jen says, knowing that, as while she and Agatha don’t hate each other anymore they have both realised that they like fighting and bickering with each other; just like real sisters.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, how about we save the bickering to later,” Nicky says, deciding it would be best to step in, and knowing from experience that there is no way his mama and Jen will stop bickering completely. “Please,” Nicky says, looking between Agatha and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “For you,” Jen says, and Agatha nods in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Nicky says, looking relieved about that. “Mama, you look amazing,” Nicky says, walking over to her and hugging her, while Jen walks over to great Liila and Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “While thank you, you don’t look to bad yourself,” Agatha tells her son, as she straightens his bowtie a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank Mama,” Nicky says. “Now we just need Mom,” Nicky realises, and just as he says that the front door opens.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m here, I’m here,” Rio says, running into the house and straight up the stairs. “I just need five minutes,” Rio says as she continues to run up the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     “You heard her, five minutes,” Agatha tells the others. “You’ve got five minutes to get ready,” Agatha says, and as soon as she says that everyone else moves to where they know they are meant to be.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Exactly five minutes after Rio ran into the house Agatha is waiting in the living room when Rio, who is wearing a dark green buttoned up vest with matching pants, but no shirt, walks into the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look incredible,” Agatha says, smiling at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “So do you,” Rio responds, walking straight over to Agatha “I really want to kiss you right now,” Rio admits, once she is right in front of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “DON’T YOU DARE!” Nicky’s voice yells, causing both Agatha and Rio to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably get out there,” Agatha says, being pretty sure that if they don’t Nicky is going to come and get them as he is just as, maybe even more, excited about what is about to happen as they are.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we should,” Rio says, reaching out and taking Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they are holding each other’s hands Rio and Agatha head through the kitchen and into the backyard. As soon as they walk into the backyard, they find Nicky waiting for them, and a completely transformed backyard. From where Nicky is standing to an arch that is covered in flowers is an aisle, that is also made of flowers, and to the left of the aisle, a little way back from the arch, Jen is standing, while Alice is in the same position on the right side, and Lilia is standing directly in front of the arch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom,” Nicky says, offering his right arm to, and Rio links arms with him. “Mama,” Nicky says, doing the same with his left arm, and once he does that, he looks at Alice, who uses her magic to cause a harp to start softly playing.
    </p>
<p>
     As the music plays Nicky escorts his moms up the aisle and when they get to the end Nicky kisses both their cheeks, one at a time, before letting go and moving several steps back while his moms look at Liliia.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is my absolute pleasure to be here today, and I consider it an absolute privilege to be the one who you asked to complete this ceremony,” Lilia says as she looks between Agatha and Rio. “Two hundred and seventy-two years ago, when alone in a cleaning at midnight, you joined yourselves together magically, spiritual, by blood, and today you add legally to the list of ways you are already joined, with those who you are closest to here to bear witness,” Lilia says. “Over the centuries you have been together, and apart, felt hate and love, for one another, but you’ve always found your way back together, because that is the strength of your bond, of your connection, and today with your son and coven around you pledge yourselves to each other in another way, a way that was once considered impossible; even for us,” Lilia says. “Rio,” Lilia says, turning to her, and Rio turns to Agatha, taking both her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’ve spent an eternity watching humanity, watching people die because of love and hate, but it wasn’t until l met you that I understood why they would do that,” Rio admits. “Since the moment I first saw you, I knew you were special, but what I didn’t know is that you would become everything to me,” Rio admits. “I will be alive forever, but it is because of you, and our family, that I live; my heart truly beats for you, Agatha, I love you,” Rio says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Lilia says, smiling at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Three hundred and thirty-three years ago after one of the worst moments of my life you can out of the shadows and turned it into one of the best,” Agatha says. “Suffering, hate, fear, prejudice, pain… that was all I knew, until you,” Agatha tells her. “Because of you I learnt to love, I learnt to feel good, and you’ve done everything you can to make me believe I deserve more than what I was given as a child,” Agatha says, fighting back her own emotion. “Rio, you may be death, but to me you’re life,” Agatha admits. “You saved me, loved me when I didn’t know what that was, and not only did you give me our son, but you also pulled off the impossible to bring him back to us. Even when was at my worse you believed I could be my best,” Agatha says. “You say your heart beats for me, well my soul is yours,” Agatha says. “Everything I am, is yours. You’re my love, my partner, my best friend, sometimes worse enemy, my everything; I love you; I trust you, I see you,” Agatha says to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rings,” Lilia says, and everyone turns to Nicky, who looks extremely nervous, as he really really doesn’t want to screw up what he is about to do.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve got it, Mi Conejito,” Rio tells him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you make we’re going to love,” Agatha assures him, as even after being together for so many years she and Rio have never had rings, and they both agreed that they whatever rings they got they wanted something that signifies not just them, but Nicky as well and because of that they asked him to create their rings.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I can do this,” Nicky says, before muttering in lattin, and waving his right hand over his left, focusing on what he wants, and moments later, in a puff of blue magick two rings appear in his hand. While both rings are silver and have amethyst, sapphire and emerald stones, stones that clearly represent each of their magicks, how connected they are on the band, the layout of the stones are different. One of the rings has the amethyst in the middle with the sapphire and emerald either side, touching the slightly bigger amethyst, the other ring has the emerald in the middle. “Perfect,” Nicky says before offering the rings to his moms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, do you take Agatha to be your lawful wedded wife?” Lilia asks, keeping it simple as she knows that the vows most people make in this situation don’t really apply.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Rio says, taking the ring with the emerald in the middle from Nicky, before sliding the ring onto Agatha’s finger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, do you take Rio to be your lawful wedded wife?” Lilia asks.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do,” Agatha responds, as she takes the ring with the amethyst in the middle from Nicky before sliding it onto Rio’s finger.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then by the powers vested in me by the state of New Jersey, as well as the two of you, it is my pleasure to add legally married to the ways you already are, you may kiss each other,” Lilia says, and as soon as she says the words Agatha and Rio embrace, and kiss, each other, as their family, their coven, clap as Jen uses her magic to make small fireworks that can’t be seen by anyone outside the yard. After a few moments they finally break apart and Nicky hugs both his mothers, clearly thrilled for them.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they hug their son Rio and Agatha embrace the rest of their family, their coven, and spend the rest of the night celebrating, with those who matter most to them, their love that even after so many trials and tribulations continues to persevere.
