<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Westview was an ordinary town, perched on the edge of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. It had it’s share of commuters to the city, but mostly it stood alone, with its own businesses, its own life. It was the hub for other nearby towns, alongside it’s close neighbour Eastview, and those who still lived within the forest, either in cabins, small rural stops along the hiking trails, or those who remained in the towns left the rot, returned to nature with some almost completely swallowed up by the forest again.</p><p>For Rio Vidal, Westview was home. It had been for a while, since she moved out of the city and set up the flower shop she had always dreamed of. Well, she bought it from the original owner, using the money her Abuela had left for her in her will. She had wanted something closer to NYC, closer to her friends and the life she built for herself when she’d moved from Delaware for college. Yet shop space in the city was expensive, along with everything else, and so she packed all her stuff and her pet tarantula into her car and made the move to New Jersey.</p><p>That had been just over a year ago, and the business was doing well. She’d made a few friends and set herself up in the apartment above the shop. She’d even gotten herself a van for deliveries and had started running to keep active. Still, she couldn’t help but feel a little…stuck. Like her life had started just rolling by. And, if she was truly honest with herself, it had been like that for years.</p><p>When she looked in the mirror, she just saw an older version of the nerdy queer girl with glasses who played saxophone and bust her knee playing basketball. And yes, she’d achieved her dream. She had her flower shop, but she had no one to share it with. No partner, no family. She just lived her life, the same day over and over. Most of which were pleasant enough, but she couldn’t help but wonder if this was it. If this was the rest of her life, and the thought made her mellow.</p><p>The day that all changed had seemed like yet another Groundhog Day. She got up, had her breakfast, got dressed, and opened the shop like she always did. She set the displays up outside and rearranged the stock, making sure every flower was fresh and vibrant. And as her customers arrived, she greeted them with smiles, offering them advice and making sure each arrangement was made to perfection. She had her regulars, like Sharon Davis, who had her own passion for flowers, and was always interested in purchasing Rio’s best cuttings.  Sometimes, however, she had surprises. And as it was approaching lunch time, one came barrelling through the doors in a frantic rush.</p><p>“I need flowers.”</p><p>Rio studied frantic woman before her. She seemed to be around her age, with a mane of thick brown hair and the most striking blue eyes she had ever seen. She was wearing worn washed jeans and a baggy shirt with a tiny Snoopy over the chest. Despite the woman’s frustrated expression, she was undoubtedly beautiful, and Rio almost found herself tongue-tied. Yet somehow, she even managed to crack a joke.</p><p>“Good job you came here then.” Rio stepped out from behind the counter. “What can I get you?”</p><p>“Like I said: flowers.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Okay…what kind of flowers?”</p><p>“Any kind,” the woman replied. “My grand opening is in three hours and the table decorations I ordered came damaged. I’ve found some old glass bottles, so I want to put some flowers in them. It isn’t what I envisioned, but it will have to do.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio perused her vast inventory. “What kind of place is it?”</p><p>“A coffee shop,” the woman answered. “Just across the street.”</p><p>“Ah, so we’re neighbours,” Rio commented. “The Witch’s Brew, right?”</p><p>“That’s it,” the woman confirmed, and Rio knew exactly what to go for.</p><p>“I’m thinking wildflowers,” she said as she perused her collection. “Let me see…Wild Daisies signal New beginnings, cosmos for harmony, some baby’s breath, and some aster for a splash of purple.”</p><p>The woman accepted the flowers and the sachets of flower feed Rio handed over with them. “Thanks, how much do I owe you?”</p><p>Rio waved her off. “Just bring me a coffee when things calm down.”</p><p>The woman smiled, and Rio swore the world grew brighter. “Well, thanks…Sorry, what was your name.”</p><p>“My name? Oh, it’s, erm, Rio.”</p><p>The woman smirked. “Are you sure about that?”</p><p>Rio nodded, internally kicking herself. Why was she such a loser in front of beautiful women? “Yeah, pretty sure.”</p><p>“Well I’m Agatha,” the woman said as she moved for the door. “Nice to meet you, neighbour.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you too,” Rio replied. “Good luck for the opening.”</p><p>Agatha winked before walked out the door. Rio watched her walk across the street, to the new business in town, before getting back to work, their interaction playing over and over in her head.</p><p> </p><p>After closing, she decided to go for a run. The October nights were drawing in quick, so she wanted to take advantage of the remaining light of dusk. And so she quickly changed into her running clothes, put her airpods in, and set off jogging down Mainstreet.</p><p>She made sure to run by the Witch’s Brew and was pleased to see it was busy. Though that did mean she couldn’t catch sight of Agatha, but perhaps she could stop by on her way back. Step in and ask how it was going, offer to help clear up at closing. Walk Agatha home, ask her on a date…</p><p>Rio shook the thoughts away. She had no chance with a woman like that. Even if she was gay, which was a small probability, why would she want t go out with a scrawny nerdy florist?</p><p>She made her way to the edge of town, running through the suburban neighbourhoods, heading towards towering treeline of pine trees. There was a small trail that jutted off into the woods, cutting across the other side of town. It was a part of her usual route, and like always she headed through the trees without hesitation.</p><p>As she followed the woodland path, music blasting in her ears, her mind went back to Agatha. She wondered why she’d moved to Westview of all places. Was she fulfilling a dream in the most cost-effective way like she was or was she there for a reason. Family? Friends? A partner? Most likely the latter, she thought sadly. People didn’t move to Westview without good reason.</p><p>As “Celebrity Skin” roared in her ears, she couldn’t hear much around her. Just the usual sights of the trees, sharpened by the shadows that grew closer every moment. Yet as the track came to an end, and the guitar intro for “Everlong” began to play, she swore she could hear something.</p><p>A crackling of twigs.</p><p>She pulled one airpod out as she slowed down to glance around her, looking for the source of the noise. Yet she saw nothing but woodland.</p><p>With a shrug, she carried on.</p><p>The path began to rear back towards town. Soon she would see the yellow of the streetlights, freshly switched on, and the warm glow of homes and the sharp light of car headlights. Yet in the woods, the only light was the rising moon as the sun slid behind the horizon.</p><p>The heavy guitar still blared in her ears as the chorus came round again. Then, it cut to quiet again. That same low guitar.</p><p>Another sound met her ears, and Rio pulled her airpod out again. She heard nothing at first, just the sound of the surrounding nature.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>A subtle sound at first, only to get louder and louder.</p><p>Closer and closer.</p><p>The sound of something running, and it was heading her way.</p><p>Rio took off again, dropping her airpod as she went. “Everlong” still blasted in her other ear as she ran, but her brain barely registered it. Instead, it was fixed on the other sound. As the fast thumps got louder and louder, and was soon accompanied by frantic breaths. Sounds that got closer and closer and she tried to run faster and faster, but it was no use.</p><p>Before she could make it to the streetlights and the houses, something collided with her, knocking her to the ground before jumping on top of her, pinning her against the woodland floor.</p><p>“Get off!” Rio gasped. “Please! I don’t have anything! Let me go!”</p><p>She tried to push up, but her attacker kept her down. Rio felt something tickle her neck and heard a soft sniffing sound. Like an animal picking up a scent. But whatever it was didn’t seem like an animal. It felt human.</p><p>And if it was human, it meant she could fight.</p><p>Gathering all her strength, she managed to swing her elbow to strike against it, enough so that she could turn and face her attacker. Yet the move made it frantic, and soon Rio was batting away swiping claws as white teeth snarled in the darkness.</p><p>She couldn’t make out the rest of it, just a dark mess of black hair, as flashes of orange caught in the light. Whatever it was, it was unlike anything Rio had ever known. A monster if she didn’t know better, and like hell she was going to become its prey.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Rio went to shove them off her, using her forearm to add more force. It managed it enough for her to roll free, but she didn’t move her arm in time.</p><p>With a strangled raw, her attacker lunged and sharp teeth pierced into her arm.</p><p>The pain was sharp and hot, and she let out a pained cry.</p><p>She used her foot to kick it back, its teeth ripping out of her arm, before it retreated back into the trees.</p><p>Rio clutched her arm, blood wetting her palm as she tried to apply pressure.</p><p>Her other airpod had fallen from her ear in the chaos, but she didn’t waste time looking for it. Instead, she moved as fast as she could down the trail, tears wetting her cheeks as blood weaved through her fingers. She could feel herself getting weaker, her entire body burning as the pain began to spread up her arm. Yet she kept going. If she kept going, she could get help. If she kept going, the pain would stop. If she kept going, she would get home.</p><p>Soon she saw the light. Saw the road. Saw civilisation, and her legs used the last of her energy to propel her forward, out of the trees and onto the road.</p><p>Relief washed over her. She’d done it.</p><p>Suddenly a bright light burned her eyes, and she turned her face away. There was a loud metallic thunk, and she looked up to see that the light belonged to a car.</p><p>The driver’s door opened and a figure climbed out. A small woman with grey hair tied up in a bun.</p><p>“Oh you gave me a fright!” The woman rushed to her side. “What’s happened? Who did this to you?”</p><p>Rio just blinked at her before dropping to the ground. The last thing she saw was the woman’s startled face, and the distant glow of the moon before she was descended into darkness.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>The next thing Rio knew, she was blinking up at a tiled ceiling. Her eyes strained, struggling to stay focused without her glasses. At first, she was confused, but soon memories flickered before her eyes. Of the woods, of the attack, of the headlights.</p><p>She bolted upright, trying to make out her surroundings. She was sat in a hospital bed, in a curtained cubicle. On the metal table beside her bed were her phone and glasses, and she quickly reached to put on the latter. They were a bit dinged up, but her eyes were relieved to no longer strain.</p><p>Her gaze then dropped to her forearm. Her running jacket was gone, replaced by a hospital gown and a tightly wound bandage covered what had been gaping holes in her flesh. She went to touch it, but before she could, the curtain pulled open and a woman in a long white coat entered.</p><p>“Oh, you’re awake.” The woman sat on the edge of her bed, a soft smile on her lips. “I’m Doctor Kale, and you gave us quite a scare.”</p><p>“I did?” Rio studied Doctor Kale. She was a good-looking woman, with a confident air about her that Rio found a little intimidating.</p><p>“You’ve been out a long while,” Doctor Kale replied. “Shock and blood loss, but your vitals are all fine now. You’re all stitched up, and we gave you some shots just in case. You’ll have a scar, but your arm should be fine in the long run.”</p><p>Rio looked at her arm, mourning her unblemished skin. At least she’d have a cool story at the bar. “Thanks, doc.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Doctor Kale smiled tightly. “What we don’t know, however, is who you are. You had no ID, and your phone is passcode protected.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m Rio. Rio Vidal. I own the flower shop in Westview. I’m guessing I’m not too far away?”</p><p>“Eastview General,” Doctor Kale answered. “A good samaritan brought you here. She said you came stumbling out of the woods. Is that where this happened?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, I got attacked by an animal or something.”</p><p>“Well, Deputy Bohner is eager to get you statement,” Doctor Kale told her. “What do you think it was?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted. “At first, I thought it was human, but it can’t be.”</p><p>Doctor Kale stared at her a moment before tilting her head. “Why would you think it was human?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted. “I didn’t see it properly, but the way it breathed, the way it felt. I was sure it was a person, but no person could ever act like that. That vicious and…it was like it hunted me down.”</p><p>Doctor Kale seemed to think over her words before smiling tightly. “Well, I better go change your name from Jane Doe on our notes, and I’ll give Deputy Bohner a call and let him know you’re awake. The woman who brought you here is still in the waiting room. She’d like to see you, but if you wish to get some more rest, I’ll tell her your fine and send her on her way.”</p><p>“No, I’d like to see her,” Rio insisted. “I want to say thanks.”</p><p>Doctor Kale nodded and left the cubicle, leaving Rio to process everything once more. Her body ached as she sat herself up a little more. She was sure she’d have some bruises on top of her stitches. Oh, she’d have fun doing inventory banged up like this.</p><p>The curtain pulled back gently again, and a small older woman walked in. She was dressed rather eccentrically, covered in bright fabrics and adorned with jewellery, her grey curls pinned back into a messy bun. Soon enough, Rio recalled her face. Recalled staring up at her, after she’d fallen to the ground, after she’d narrowly missed being hit by the woman’s car. She couldn’t imagine the fright she gave her, but the woman still greeted her with a warm smile.</p><p>“Well, it’s a relief to see you awake, dear.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio managed a smile. “Thank you for bringing me here.”</p><p>“What was I going to do? Leave you in the road?” The woman shook her head. “I couldn’t have left you there.”</p><p>“I’m still grateful,” Rio insisted. “I can imagine I was pretty messed up. I’m sorry if I scared you.”</p><p>The woman waved her off. “I’ve seen worse. I’m just glad you’re alright.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio admitted, before looking around again. “Do you know what time it is?”</p><p>“It’s just past two in the morning,” the woman told her. “You’ve been out a while.”</p><p>Rio groaned and put her head in her hands. “Oh great.”</p><p>“Whatever you’re worrying about, don’t,” the woman insisted. “Whatever it is can wait until you’re given the all-clear.”</p><p>“I need to go home,” Rio insisted. “I need to open my shop.”</p><p>“I’m sure someone else can cover…”</p><p>“No,” Rio answered. “It’s just me, and those flowers aren’t going to sell themselves.”</p><p>“Oh, you own that flower shop in Westview. Vidal’s Flowers?”</p><p>She nodded and held out her hand. “I’m Rio. Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Lilia Calderu.” The woman shook her hand gently. “Now if you are insisting on leaving, I in turn insist on driving you home. Just so I know you’re safe.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” Rio replied. “You’ve done more than enough for me already.”</p><p>Once more, Lilia dismissed her. “Just humour an old girl and give her a little peace of mind knowing you’re safely tucked up at home.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t really argue with that, though she did end up arguing with her doctor. Doctor Kale was reluctant to let her leave and after some back and forth, she dug her heels in and insisted on monitoring her until the end of her shift. Yet when the time came, and Rio’s responses and blood pressure were spot on, she relented and signed off on her discharge.</p><p>Soon enough, Rio was sat in the passage seat of Lilia’s Subaru Forester, listening to Mazzy Star on the radio.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I bled all over your car,” Rio said. “I can pay to get it cleaned.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Lilia insisted. “I was rather impressed with myself that I could get you on the backseat. Seems I still have a little bit of adrenaline left in me.”</p><p>Rio considered her words. “I think I was running on adrenaline in the end. I think that’s why I crashed as soon as I saw you. Like my body decided it was safe enough to give up.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Lilia mused. “Are you sure you feel okay enough to go home?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio insisted yet again. “I feel fine, just a little banged up. A few more hours sleep and I’ll be alright.”</p><p>Lilia glanced at her sceptically. “Alright then.”</p><p>Lilia made a point of going the long way round. Rio suspected she had done it on purpose to avoid the stretch of road she’d staggered on to, and she couldn’t help but be a little thankful.</p><p>The Subaru soon pulled up outside of Vidal’s Flowers, and Rio carefully took her seatbelt off before giving Lilia a grateful smile. “Thanks for the lift, and everything else.”</p><p>“Any time,” Lilia insisted. “Now go rest up. We might just manage to get a couple of hours sleep.”</p><p>Rio nodded and climbed out of the car. “Free flowers for life. Seriously, anything is on the house.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “I may take you up on that, but be safe, dear. And no more running in the woods!”</p><p>Rio gave her a finger salute with her non-injured arm and made her way inside.</p><p>She wrapped her bandaged arm in a plastic wrap from the store before heading up to the apartment and stripped off the rest of her clothes. Standing before her bathroom mirror, she took herself in. There were a few superficial cuts here and there, and more than enough tender patches of darkened skin that would soon be a wincing shade of purple. Nothing on her face, which was good, but luckily it was cool enough to bring out her long-sleeved shirts.</p><p>After attempting to shower the best she could, she decided to try get some sleep, but ended up skipping aimlessly through the TV channels instead. Though there was a still a few weeks to go, it seemed they were all ramping up for Halloween, and she ended up watching <em>Ginger Snaps</em>. Probably not the best choice of film after her ordeal, but she sat through it anyway.</p><p>Afterwards, she got changed and opened the shop. By then it was around lunchtime, and she soon found herself inundated with concerned customers wondering why she had opened so late and of course asking what happened to her arm. She told them all she’d slipped while on a run and had to spend some time in hospital, which earned her endless amounts of sympathetic looks but thankfully not too much interrogation. She seriously didn’t have the energy for that.</p><p>She was making up a bouquet of roses for a collection order when the shop door opened, and she felt every hair on her body stand on end. She looked up to see Agatha carrying over a large coffee, her lips curled in a warm smile.</p><p>Rio gulped. She was even more beautiful than she remembered.</p><p>“Finally, you’re open,” Agatha said as she reached the counter. “I’ve been waiting all morning to bring you this.”</p><p>“You didn’t have to…”</p><p>“It was our deal.” Agatha held the to-go cup out for her. “Coffee for flowers.”</p><p>Rio accepted it and took a sip. “How did you know I like it black?”</p><p>“Call it barista’s intuition.” Agatha’s gaze dropped to her arm. “What happened there?”</p><p>“Accident,” Rio answered quickly. “Went for a run last night and got a bit banged up.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Shit! Are you okay?”</p><p>“I am,” Rio assured. “Just need to get healed up.”</p><p>“Well, I’m glad you’re okay,” Agatha said with a smile. “The flowers were a hit, by the way. I might have to come back for more.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure to keep stocked up,” Rio promised. “How did the opening go? I saw it was pretty busy when I left last night.”</p><p>“It went great. We’ve been run off our feet, but we know things will calm down in a day or two. After that, the real hard work begins. It’s easy getting customers when you’re shiny and new, but not so much when you become part of the landscaping.”</p><p>“You sound like you’re talking from experience?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I owned a coffee shop in Greenwich Village.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah, it was pretty successful, but I sold it to this artisan baker. My friend wanted to move back home so I came with her, and we set up the Witch’s Brew together. And before you ask: no, I’m not mad. I wanted a new challenge, and a fresh start.”</p><p>“Hey, that seems pretty reasonable to me,” Rio said, though she was thinking something along those lines. “I hope it gives you what you’re looking for. I don’t regret making the move, though I think my social life would be better if I’d stayed in the city.”</p><p>“Maybe we can do something about it,” Agatha said with a smirk. “Come round the Brew sometime. I know Wanda would love to meet you, and I’ll make you another coffee on the house.”</p><p>“I’ll take you up on that,” Rio promised, before raising her cup. “Thanks for this. You have no idea how much I need caffeine today.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she moved towards the door. “Anytime for a good neighbour.”</p><p>Rio watched her leave like a lovesick puppy, before taking another sip of her coffee. Despite her aches and tiredness, she had to push on. Those flowers weren’t going to sell themselves.</p><p> </p><p><em>The woods were dark, but Rio ran without fear. </em></p><p><em>Her legs carried her forward with ease, and as the cool night breeze ran through her hair, she couldn’t recall ever feeling this free. This alive. </em></p><p><em>Soon, she arrived at a clearing. In the centre was a small pool of water, surrounded by soggy autumn leaves. Rio stepped towards it, admiring the reflection of the moon, full and glowing against the night sky. Yet as she reached the water’s edge, it wasn’t her face that was reflected against the water. </em></p><p><em>The wolf stared back at her curiously and as Rio tilted her head, it did the same.</em></p><p><em>She took a step closer, wanting to look closer. Yet the movement made the wolf snarl.</em></p><p><em>It dived towards her, emerging from the water. She tried to scream, tried to run, but she was powerless.</em></p><p><em>In an instant, the wolf was soon upon her.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio woke up to sharp sunlight, her face smushed against the couch cushions. She stretched her arms and saw she was still in her work clothes. It seemed the nap she decided to have on the couch went on longer than she planned.</p><p>Luckily, she’d had the sense to put her phone on charge before she crashed and she reached for where it still lay on the coffee table. Unplugging it, she checked the time. It was just after nine. The shop would be open late again.</p><p>She decided to take a minute to check her notifications and spotted she had a Facebook friend request. Curious, she clicked to see who it was. When she spotted the name, her heart jumped.</p><p><em>Agatha Harkness.</em></p><p>Surely, it couldn’t be…</p><p>She clicked on the profile, and sure enough there she was. A sinfully hot selfie stared back at her, those blue eyes piercing back at her through the screen. A warmth filled her chest. She’d never been so enamoured by a photo before, but she held no shame. How could someone possibly look at this woman and not kneel at her feet in absolute devotion?</p><p>The thought made her laugh to herself. She was a loser lesbian at the best of times, but Agatha had brought her to a whole new level.  </p><p>She accepted the request without further hesitation and was unable to control her smile. Sure, she didn’t want to get ahead of herself, but this was a good sign, right? Like, Agatha had gone out of her way to search her up and the send the request, or perhaps she’d just come up as a mutual friend, but this was…this was good. This was something she could work with, as long as she didn’t make a complete fool of herself.</p><p>Rio stomach growled, and it was then she remembered she’d fallen asleep before dinner. With another groan, she slowly pulled herself off the couch, stretching her limbs before making her way to the kitchen.</p><p> She made herself some toast, then poured herself a bowl of cereal, then fried up some bacon. No matter how much she ate, she couldn’t satisfy her hunger. Even after high school basketball games and college days spent with a killer hangover, she’d never known a hunger like this.  </p><p>After raiding the cupboards and devouring a full pack of twinkies, she decided enough was enough. It was time to take a shower.</p><p>She walked towards the bathroom, taking off her clothes as she went.  Her trousers were kicked off somewhere in the hallway, and she was pulling her shirt over her head as she entered the bathroom. Once she pulled it off, she caught sight of herself in her bathroom mirror, and it was then she faltered.</p><p>Rio frowned at her reflection.</p><p>Something was…different.</p><p>Sure, it was her. No doubt about it. Yet her body seemed more toned, her arms and thighs refined, while her stomach had hardened with muscle. She flexed her arms, watching the ripple of flesh as she tensed the impressive muscle.</p><p>But it wasn’t just that. Her hair seemed different to. Lighter, more vibrant, and as she ran her hair through it, she noted its sudden thickness. Her jaw was sharper too, stronger even. She still had that slight baby face, but she’d definitely altered. Her skin had also completely healed. No scratches, no bruises. In fact, the only evidence of what happened that night was the bandage on her arm.</p><p>She looked at it in her reflection. Doctor Kale had told her not to change it for at least forty-eight hours, but her curiosity was too much, and so after a moment of fiddling, she managed to unwind the dressing from around her forearm. The bandage underneath was stuck string to her skin, yet with a braced breath, she got her nail under one of the corners and pulled.</p><p>As the bandage peeled off, a number of black threads came with it, falling into the sink. Rio looked at them in confusion. Were they…were they her stitches?</p><p>She quickly looked at the wound, prepared to see gapping holes in her flesh, especially now the stitches weren’t in place. Except there was no blood, no open skin, just a broken circle of small scars. Rio’s frown deepened as her fingers cautiously traced the skin. If she didn’t know any better, she’d say it had been healed for years, not hours.</p><p>She shook her head. This couldn’t be real…right?</p><p>Leaving the bathroom, Rio walked through her apartment and picked up her glasses from the coffee table. She pushed them on her face, only to blink rapidly. Her eyes couldn’t focus, and everything seemed doubled. Pulling them off, her eyes quickly adjusted back to normal.</p><p>She frowned at her glasses and cleaned them against her couch blanket. Holding them to the light, she confirmed they were crystal clear before trying again. Same result.</p><p>It was then she heard a loud banging coming from downstairs. Grasping the blanket and wrapped it around herself, she headed for the door leading down to the shop.</p><p>When she opened it, she realised the sound was someone knocking on the shop door. With a huff, she shouted down the stairs. “We’re not open yet!”</p><p>“Ms Vidal?” A man’s muffled voice called back. “It’s Deputy Bohner with the Eastview Sheriff’s Department. I’d like to ask you a few questions about what happened to you the other night.”</p><p>Rio groaned. This morning was getting worse and worse.</p><p>She threw on a hoodie and some slacks before rushing down the stairs, greeting the deputy with a smile as she opened the door. “Morning, Deputy. Sorry, I’m usually open but I overslept.”</p><p>“No worries, Ms Vidal.” The deputy stepped inside confidently and surveyed his surroundings. “Nice little shop. You know, I never understood how places like this stay open. Who’s spending money on something that doesn’t last?”</p><p>Rio smiled tightly, all while wanting to sucker punch him in the gut. “So, how can I help you?”</p><p>“I have a few questions about what happened to you the night before last.” He pulled out a notebook. “Could you please tell me what happened?”</p><p>“Well, I went out for a run down the woodland trail…”</p><p>“Not very sensible,” Deputy Bohner commented.</p><p>“It’s my usual running route,” Rio countered, before continuing. “And I heard something running towards me. I tried to get away, but it caught up and pinned me to the ground. There was a struggle. It bit me and I kicked it off. I managed to get to the road and that’s when Lilia, the woman in the car, found me.”</p><p>“So you believe it was an animal?” Deputy Bohner questioned.</p><p>“Pretty sure.”</p><p>He pursed his lips. “Can you describe your attacker to me?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It was dark, so I didn’t get a good luck at it, but it was strong, vicious, with big white teeth and claws. It had dark hair, or fur I guess, and…and I could see sharp orange.”</p><p>“Sharp orange?”</p><p>“Yeah like…like orange strands in its hair.”</p><p> Ralph Bohner frowned before crossing something out in his notebook. “That was likely just the sunset.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio couldn’t believe this guy was mansplaining her own attack.</p><p>“Well, from the sounds of it, it was an animal attack.” Deputy Bohner put his notebook away. “I will patrol the trail looking for any tracks. And I assure you, if there’s a dangerous animal nearby, I’ll not rest until I have it skin, stuffed and mounted above my mantle.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said once more. “Is that all, Deputy? I need to get ready so I can open up.”</p><p>“Yes, yes.” Deputy Bohner began to walk towards the door. “I’ll be in touch if I need anything else, but I assure you, Ms Vidal, you will be perfectly safe under my watch.”</p><p>Rio held the door open for him, and once he was gone she made sure to swing it firmly shut. Thank fuck he was gone.</p><p>Her gaze then moved to the Witch’s Brew, already open and bustling. She thought back to the friends request, the one good thing that had happened that morning, before her stomach let out another hearty growl.</p><p>She locked up the door and headed back upstairs, returning not long after in her work clothes, and threw on her apron to start the day. As she greeted customers as she always did, her brain couldn’t help but drifting. To her hunger, to her hair, to her now muscular build, to her suddenly regenerative skin and 20-20 vision. Perhaps she’d hit her head or was under some kind of deep hallucination. Whatever it was, she wanted to snap out of it, even if she had to admit she looked pretty good.</p><p>Instead, she tried to focus on the flowers, and to stealing glances across the street. She told herself that she’d go get a coffee after work. That she’d say hi to Agatha, and maybe create more of a connection between them. Even if it was purely friendship, Rio couldn’t help but want to be close to her, and it seemed Agatha had some interest also.</p><p>It was ten minutes to closing when the shop door opened. Rio was doing inventory and didn’t bother looking up. “If you want me to make a bouquet, you have five minutes.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I only like pink roses.”</p><p>Rio looked up at the familiar voice and her heart lurched uncomfortably in her chest.</p><p>“Doctor Kale.” She quickly hid her arm behind her back. “Nice to see you.”</p><p>Doctor Kale gave her an awkward smile. “Hi Rio. You look…well.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded. “Yeah, I mean besides my injuries. But you don’t need to look. I’m fine.”</p><p>Doctor Kale gave her a sceptical look. “Now we both know that’s not true, Rio. You don’t have to lie. Not to.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean that I know what’s happening to you,” the doctor replied. “And I know why?”</p><p>“You do? H-how? I don’t even know…”</p><p>“Because I know what…hold on.” Doctor Kale moved back to the door and waved to someone outside. Then another woman stepped inside. She was shorter than the doctor, wearing a bomber jacket and black ripped jeans. Her hair was jet black, cut to her shoulders and styled in messy waves, yet what caught Rio’s attention was the dyed streaks. Streaks of vibrant orange.</p><p>The woman smiled at Rio awkwardly as she stepped up to the counter. “Hey.”</p><p>Rio just stared back at her.</p><p>Doctor Kale nudged the woman, who reluctantly reached in her pocket and placed something on the counter. Rio looked down, and her heart started thumping in her chest.</p><p>Her airpods.</p><p>The ones she’d lost.</p><p>The ones she’d left behind after…</p><p>She looked up at the woman sharply. “Who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Alice,” the woman replied. “And we need to talk.”</p>

<p>Rio locked the shop door and switched the sign to closed, before turning back to look at her visitors. Doctor Kale leaned against the counter, a serious expression on her face, while Alice stood awkwardly with her hands in her pockets.</p><p>“Right.” Rio folded her arms. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Alice looked to Doctor Kale, who rolled her eyes. “We’ve talked about this. It’s your mess. You fix it.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes pleaded with the doctor, but when she gained nothing more than a stern look in reply, she finally relented and met Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“Okay so this is really hard to explain, but…it was me. I’m the…the thing from the woods. I’m the one that…attacked you. That bit you.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, the words sinking in. At first she was shocked, her brain trying to process the new revelation. Then something clicked, and she was filled with rage.</p><p>“You…You did this to me?!”</p><p>Alice held her hands up in defence. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know what I was doing. You have to believe me, Rio. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“What do you mean you didn’t know what you were doing?!” Rio demanded. “What, were you on drugs or something?!”</p><p>“No,” both Alice and Doctor Kale answered, the latter pushed herself off the counter to step between them.</p><p>“Rio, I promise you that Alice would never do anything like this. Not as she is now, anyway.”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘as she is now’?” Rio questioned, stepping away from them. “What the hell is going on?”</p><p>Doctor Kale sighed and looked back to Alice. “You’re going to have to show her.”</p><p>Rio took another step back, her hands gripping the edge of one of the display tables. “Show me what?”</p><p>Alice held up her hand and with a flick of her wrist, sharp claws pierced from her fingertips.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in horror. She remembered those claws. How they swiped at her in an attempt to break her flesh. Even in the darkness, they had burned into her memory, and in the glow of the rustic lightbulbs of the shop, they were undeniable.</p><p>It was true. It was her.</p><p>“What are you?” Rio demanded. “What do you want from me?”</p><p>Alice and the doctor exchanged glances again, but this time the former needed no encouragement to continue.</p><p>“I’m a werewolf.”</p><p>“A werewolf?” Rio frowned. “But…werewolves aren’t real.”</p><p>“They are,” Alice shook out her hand and the claws retracted. “I thought the same once, but I can assure you, we are very real.”</p><p>Rio looked to Doctor Kale. “Are you one too?”</p><p>“No,” Doctor Kale answered. “I’m a witch.”</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>“B-but I don’t understand. It wasn’t a full moon. How did you…”</p><p>“The whole full-moon thing is a myth,” Alice explained. “The only night we can’t change is on a new moon. That’s when we’re at our weakest. For most, the full moon is the only time we fully transform, but we can transform anytime. Mostly at night, usually somewhere remote, where we can let out our wolf for a while.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t call the edge of town remote,” Rio snapped. “Kids play out in those woods.”</p><p>“I wasn’t at first!” Rio insisted. “I’m usually out near the old Firewatch tower. Then I caught a scent, and I couldn’t help but chase it. By the time I caught up with you, I was full wolf-brain. Once you kicked me, I got a bit of myself back and I…I panicked. I ran. By the time I doubled back, you were gone, and I found your airpods. I was hoping I’d eventually catch your scent again, but when Jen came home and she told me about you, I…” Tears trailed down Alice’s cheeks, blackened by her eyeliner. “I cannot even articulate how much I hate myself for this.”</p><p>Doctor Kale, Jen, placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “You’re doing well, baby.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe this. “You’re really comforting her right now?!”</p><p>“Trust me, I’m not particularly happy about my girlfriend biting other people either,” Jen interjected. “She slept on the couch last night.”</p><p>Alice dropped her head in shame. “I’m sorry. My wolf just…I couldn’t help myself.”</p><p>Rio ran a stressed hand through her hair. “Wait, so is this why I’m suddenly ripped as fuck? Because you fucking bit me and now…wait, have you turned me into a fucking werewolf?!”</p><p>Guilt marked Alice’s face, and Rio felt like the ground had just collapsed beneath her. She gripped onto the table tighter as her knees threatened to buckle.</p><p>No. No this couldn’t be happening.</p><p>“Why?!” she demanded. “Why did you have to do this to me?!”</p><p>“I didn’t want to,” Alice insisted. “It’s…it’s hard to explain…”</p><p>“Then try!”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Jen got between them again. “Let’s just calm down.”</p><p>“Calm down?! You really expect me to calm down right now!”</p><p>“I’d hope you’d at least see the severity of the situation and take it seriously.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Don’t make me sound like the bad guy here. You can’t blame me for reacting like this.”</p><p>“She has a point, Jen,” Alice argued, and Rio shot her a glare.</p><p>“And I don’t want <em>you</em> helping me!”</p><p>“Maybe we should go upstairs,” Jen suggested. “We can talk this out.”</p><p>Alice nodded in agreement. “I’ll tell you everything you need to know, and we’ll work out how to go forward. About the changes, about our pack, about…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What?” Jen questioned. “What do you mean ‘no’?”</p><p>“I mean that I don’t want this. I don’t want a pack, I don’t want to change, I don’t want any of this.”</p><p>“Rio, it’s not that simple.” Alice’s voice was filled with sympathy. “And I’m sorry…”</p><p>“Stop saying you’re sorry!” Rio snapped. “I’ll find a way to stop this! I’m not becoming like you! Now get out of my shop!”</p><p>“Rio, you’re being ridiculous,” Jen argued, but Rio was already unlocking the door. She forced it open and stared challengingly back at them. “Go now or I’m calling the police.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes and walked out. “You’re making a big mistake.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio responded, before looking back at Alice. “And I never want to see you again.”</p><p>Alice nodded in understanding. “I just wanted to help…”</p><p>“You’ve done enough,” Rio snapped. “Out.”</p><p>Alice bowed her head and had barely made it out of the door before Rio slammed it behind her.</p><p>She made quick work of locking up before storming up the stairs. She logged on to her computer and pulled up google, typing in the question she was now desperate for an answer to.</p><p>‘How to cure a werewolf’.</p><p>She clicked on the first link and began to scroll. There some designated as unrelated to folklore, the most tempting being killing the wolf that turned you, though Rio wasn’t sure about the moral implications of running up behind human Alice and stabbing her in the back. Yet, as she scrolled further, there was a short list of potential cures found in old folktales.</p><p>The first was finding a magical object linked to the curse, which Rio didn’t have. The next was killing the witch that enacted the curse, which again was a no-go. That left one last option, probably the most fool proof of the bunch.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Rio groaned and put her head in her hands. She couldn’t stay like this forever. Sure, her life had been boring before, but this was too much. She wanted to be normal. To run the flower shop, to fall in love, to get married, to have kids, and live a happy, uneventful life. Now that seemed completely out of reach.</p><p>She didn’t want this. If only she hadn’t gone for a run that night. If only she had gone to the Witch’s Brew and been brave enough to just go talk Agatha. None of this would’ve happened. She’d be herself, not the skin for a monster.</p><p>It was in that moment that she decided enough was enough. She wasn’t going to accept this. She would carry on as she always did. She would starve the wolf within her. She’d show Alice that she was wrong. That she would never become what she had tried to make her.</p><p>And so, she changed into some sports leggings and a hoodie and headed over to the Witch’s Brew.</p><p>Warmth hit her as soon as she walked through the door, along with a scent of coffee and cinnamon. As the sky had darkened, the coffee shop had filled with a warm glow adding to the coziness of the rustic wooden furniture and the whimsigothic autumnal decor.</p><p>It wasn’t as busy as it had been during the day, but Rio still had to stand in a small queue before eventually reaching the counter. She was disappointed to Agatha wasn’t the one serving but greeted the red-haired woman behind the counter with a warm smile.</p><p>“Hey, can I get a hot cocoa, please.” Her gaze then drifted to the display of sweet backed. “And a cinnamon roll too.”</p><p>“Coming right up.” The woman rang it through on the register. “What name shall I put on the order?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The woman paused. “Rio? As in flower shop Rio?”</p><p>“That’s me,” she confirmed, and saw the woman’s eyes light up in delight.</p><p>“Can you wait right there?” The woman rushed into the back and returned a few moments later with Agatha. Rio quickly stood to attention, her heart thumping hard in her chest. She still couldn’t believe how beautiful she was.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha quickly moved round the counter to greet her. “This is a nice surprise.”</p><p>“I did promise I’d stop by,” Rio reminded her. “Nice place you have here.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha then looked to the redhead. “I’ll make Rio’s order. Cancel it off the register. It’s on the house.”</p><p>“Sure it is.” The redhead smirked. “I’m Wanda, by the way. It’s nice to put a face to the name this one won’t shut up about.”</p><p>“Rio, why don’t you go sit down,” Agatha quickly suggested. “I’ll get your order ready for you.”</p><p>Rio went to sit at one of the smaller tables, secretly smiling to herself. So Agatha had been talking about her a lot. That was good. Definitely good.</p><p>As she sat down, she spotted the table decoration. The flowers were holding up, but it wouldn’t be long before they began to wilt. She made note to bring a fresh batch over. To be a helpful neighbour, of course.</p><p>Agatha carried over a tray holding two drinks and a plated cinnamon roll. Rio stood to help her, but she set it down with ease. “I thought I’d join you, if that’s okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded eagerly. “I’d love the company.”</p><p>Agatha smiled as she sat down opposite her. She too had gone with hot cocoa and cupped the mug with both hands. Rio’s attention, however, was fixed on the cinnamon roll. The moment she began eating it, she couldn’t stop. It tasted so good, and the texture was so soft and pillowy that she couldn’t get enough. Before she knew it, it was all gone.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I’m guessing you were hungry?”</p><p>Rio blushed and nodded. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t apologise,” Agatha assured. “I’m guessing by the way you inhaled it that you liked it?”</p><p>“It was delicious. Seriously, Agatha, this place is amazing.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha took a sip of her cocoa before placing the cup down. “You seemed different.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. “I do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah, you look good.”</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded again. “Did you get highlights in your hair?”</p><p>“Y-yeah,” Rio lied, touching the ends of her hair. “Do they look okay?”</p><p>“Very nice,” Agatha assured. “So, Rio, I have some questions.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“My first being what brought you to Westview? Wanda said she doesn’t remember you, so you must have moved here recently.”</p><p>“I moved here just over a year ago. Before then I was living in New York, nut I’m originally from Delaware. What about you? I mean, I know you lived in New York too, but was somewhere else home before then?”</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. “Okay, promise not to laugh.”</p><p>Rio held up her hand. “Scouts honour.”</p><p>“Well, I’m actually from Salem.”</p><p>“Salem? As in Salem, Massachusetts?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Hence the Witch’s Brew.”</p><p>“Wow.” Rio’s mind travelled back to her earlier visitors. Jen had said she was witch, but she wasn’t sure if she was the kind of witch that played with tarot cards and crystals, or if she was the whole <em>Hocus Pocus </em>deal. “Did you like it there?”</p><p>“Not much,” Agatha admitted. “My mother still lives there, which is why I don’t. We don’t have the best of relationships. Do you see much of your parents?”</p><p>Rio reached for her own mug and took a large swig. “No, they died when I was a kid.”</p><p>She watched Agatha’s face drop. “Shit, Rio, I…”</p><p>“It’s alright,” she quickly assured. “I don’t remember them, really. I was too little. My Abuela raised me, so she was pretty much both parents rolled into one. She died a few years ago. She’s the person who encouraged my love for plants and flowers, so I used the money she left me to start up the shop. I couldn’t afford a place in the city, so I made the plunge and moved here.”</p><p>“It is a cute town,” Agatha admitted. “When Wanda persuaded me to move up here, I was dubious, but I do like it. Especially the company.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>They stayed there until closing, chatting about anything and everything. When it was time to close, Rio helped put all the chairs on the tables before taking up sweeping duty, and even utilised the mop for a very stubborn tried coffee spill.</p><p>“So, Rio,” Wanda piped up as she stood on a stepping stool to clear the specials board by the door. “You seeing anyone?”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha called warningly from the counter. “Leave her alone.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio assured. “And no. I’m single.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Wanda noted. “So is Agatha. Me too, but mostly Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat sharply. “Wanda, can you come help me with these receipts?”</p><p>“Coming.” Wanda handed Rio the cloth. “Can you finish that off for me?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio stepped up to begin cleaning the rest of the sign. It was then she her gaze caught something in the window. A half-moon looming overhead.</p><p>Her free hand flexed, and she felt an uncomfortable shiver rush over her. She quickly shook it away. No, she wasn’t dealing with this. She was helping clear up then heading home. The would be no wolfing tonight, or ever if she could help it.</p><p>Once everything was cleared up and the receipts and inventory were all done, Rio followed Agatha out onto the sidewalk as Wanda switched off the lights.</p><p>“Thanks for helping,” Agatha said, and Rio shrugged it off.</p><p>“Just being a good neighbour.”</p><p>“A good neighbour?” Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that all?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip and dropped her gaze. “Okay, maybe a bit more than that.”</p><p>“Good, because they’re showing <em>Twilight </em>at the movie theatre tomorrow night, and I was wondering if you wanted to go?”</p><p>“As friends, or…”</p><p>“Or…” Agatha grinned deviously. “What do you say?”</p><p>“I say I’d fucking love to.”</p><p>“Great. Pick me up at seven.”</p><p>“Ah, you’ve set a date,” Wanda commented as she joined them outside, making quick work of locking up. “Finally. I was sick of the pinning, and it’s only been a couple of days.”</p><p>Agatha elbowed her friend, who laughed in response. “Come on, Aggie. I want to get started on dinner.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and gave Rio apologetic look. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “At seven o’clock sharp.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha began to follow Wanda down the street. “Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight Agatha.”</p><p>She stood and watched her disappear down the street, before reluctantly making her way back across to her own shop. As she approached the door, she fished her keys out of her pocket, only for them to slip from her hands and clatter against the front step.</p><p>“Fuck sake.”</p><p>She went to pick up the keys, but a sharp pain in her back caused her to double over instead. Her heartbeat rang in her ears.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>No, this couldn’t be happening. Not here. Not now.</p><p>Rio managed to grab her keys and took off down the street. She needed to get away from buildings, away from people. She needed to get as far away from town as possible.</p><p>It wasn’t long before she found the woodland trail, and this time she didn’t stay on the path. She ran deeper into the woods, her legs never tiring as she got faster and faster.</p><p>Her clothes seemed tight, and her skin was too hot. She tried desperately to ignore it, but soon it became too much. Slowing to stagger, she kicked off her shoes and pulled her leggings from her legs and her hoodie off over her head, discarding them on the dense forest floor.</p><p>She went to run again, but her legs buckled and she fell flat to the ground. With a huff, she tried to pull herself up, only for her body to give way again.</p><p>Before she could question what was happening, a stinging pain attacked the ends of her fingers. She held them up in the moonlight, expecting to have somehow cut herself on thorns or something. Instead, she watched in horror as her nails fell from her flesh, replaced by rapidly growing sets of sharpened claws.</p><p>“No, no, no.” She shook her hands as she had seen Alice do, hoping it would make them go away, but it was no use. They just pushed on, getting longer and longer, the sensation excruciating.</p><p>A numb pressure began to build in her mouth, white her limbs felt as though they were being pulled out of their sockets. She cried out for help, cried out to try relieving the pain, but it was no use. Her mouth began to ache, and she could feel her canine teeth push forth, grazing against the side of her mouth.</p><p>She tried to push herself up again, her heart beating so fast she thought it would burst from her chest. Yet as her arm stretched out in front of her, she watched in horror as her bones began to click and snap, changing into a new form.</p><p>Her lower legs snapped backwards and she screamed, eyes clenched cut as she writhed on the ground. Her limbs cracked and twisted, and soon the cries couldn’t even come. It was all too much. She could feel the jagged teeth brush against her lips, and the claws pushed further out of her fingers.</p><p>There was no stopping it now. Now she was becoming the monster.</p><p>She felt her arms push her up, felt her legs gain traction on the ground. Her body was out of her control, and as her head tipped back, she began to slip back into darkness.</p><p>Her wolf let out a mighty howl, and Rio Vidal was gone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio awoke with a start, gasping for breath. </p><p>It was dark, the only light being a large camping lantern dangling from the ceiling, and she was laid comfortably under a knitted blanket. </p><p>Her hands quickly patted against her chest, before examining her fingers and checking her teeth. She sighed with overwhelming relief. She was all back to normal. </p><p>Well, as normal as she could be when she was totally naked in what looked to be a random cabin.</p><p>She took in her surroundings. The place was pretty small, with not other furniture besides a freestanding unit placed in the middle of the room holding what looked to be a metal disk, and desk chair that had seen much better days. She figured it was some kind of ranger’s post, only used in case of emergencies. Had her wolf broken in? Perhaps she’d tired herself out, though she figured a wolf would rather curl up in foliage than a bed. Or at least not care for the dignity of a blanket.</p><p>“Oh, good. You’re awake.”</p><p>Rio looked round to see Alice sitting upright in the far corner of the space. </p><p>Unlike her, Alice was fully dressed but had what looked like a fresh but across her cheek. Rio watched as she got up and walked cautiously towards her.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” she asked as she knelt by the edge of the bed, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh. </p><p>“I feel really fucking great, Alice. Thanks for asking.”</p><p>“I know, I know, but right now how do you feel?”</p><p>Rio slumped her shoulders. “I feel fine. Pretty good, actually.”</p><p>Alice smiled. “That’s good. I can’t remember much about my first time, but as long as you feel alright, I guess that’s good.”</p><p>Rio nodded in acceptance before taking in her surroundings once more. “What is this place?”</p><p>“The old Firewatch tower. We use it as a base.”</p><p>“We?”</p><p>“The pack. Well, me and Olivia. She was here too, but she went to, erm, find your clothes.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio pulled the blanket further up over her. “So you were with me last night?”</p><p>“For most of it,” Alice answered. “We spent most of the night trying to stop you from running back to town. You seemed pretty determined to get back there.”</p><p>“I was?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio thought for a moment, before asking a niggling question. “What was I like?”</p><p>“Like the normal you, but with teeth and claws. And, er, something else.”</p><p>“Something else?” Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Before Alice could answer, the door to the lookout swung open and a small woman walked inside holding a bundle of fabric under her arm. Her outfit was a simple oversized sweater and cargos, her blonde hair short and unkept, and her right cheek was blemished by a purple bruise. She threw the bundle on the bed in front of Rio. “There you go.”</p><p>Rio unravelled it to find her clothes from the night before, shoes and all.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“I found these too.” The woman fished in her pocket and tossed the flower shop keys on the bed also. “I couldn’t find a phone though.”</p><p>“I didn’t have one,” Rio assured. “I only went out to get coffee.”</p><p> “We’ve all said that one before.” The woman sat at the other end of the bed, crossing her legs. “I’m Olivia.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Are you British?”</p><p>Olivia pulled a revolted face. “No, I’m Swedish. I picked up some bad habits at boarding school. The unfortunate twang was one of them.”</p><p>“Right…what happened to your face?”</p><p>Olivia laughed again. “You did, honey.”</p><p>“Me?” Rio looked to Alice and pointed to the cut on her cheek. “Was that me too?”</p><p>“Like I said, you were pretty determined to get back to town.”</p><p>“So what, I wanted to hurt someone?” Rio questioned. “Why would I want to do that?”</p><p>“You didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Olivia assured. “In fact, you wanted to make someone very happy.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Olivia went to answer, but Alice held up her hand to stop her.</p><p>“Rio, do you have a partner?”</p><p>“No, why?”</p><p>“Or anyone you like?” Alice pressed. “A crush or even a slight interest?”</p><p>“I mean I guess, why?”</p><p>Alice looked to Olivia, who smirked knowingly. “Well, that explains that.”</p><p>“Explains what?”</p><p>Olivia went to reply, but Alice was quicker. “When you transformed, your body was mostly the same besides some bone structure, the teeth, the claws, and a certain added…appendage.”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned, before her eyes widened. “Wait, does my wolf have a <em>dick?</em>”</p><p>Alice avoided her gaze but Olivia just laughed it off. “Don’t worry. It’s normal.”</p><p>“How is any of this normal?!” She looked to Alice. “Well, what do you have to say?”</p><p>Alice bowed her head in shame. “I’m sorry, Rio. I know it’s a lot, but…”</p><p>“There’s no ‘but’,” Rio huffed. “It’s a lot, full stop. Fuck!”</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Olivia piped up. “So, Rio, this person is someone you know, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I met her the day Alice bit me.”</p><p>Alice sat up. “You did?”</p><p>“Yeah, why?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Olivia assured. “Anything could have triggered it.”</p><p>“Triggered what?” Rio questioned. “Wait, I-I wasn’t going to hurt her, was I?”</p><p>“What?” Olivia frowned. “No, of course not.” </p><p>“But my wolf…”</p><p>“Your wolf is you,” Alice insisted. “You’d never hurt anyone you cared about. Or anyone you didn’t see as a threat.”</p><p>“So that night you thought I was a threat?”</p><p>“No, not at all.”</p><p>“But you bit me!”</p><p>“That was totally different.”</p><p>“How?!”</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>“Oh, for fuck sake,” Olivia cursed. “Can you stop complaining and can you stop apologizing for five minutes so we can actually explain what’s going on.”</p><p>Rio tucked her knees to her chest. “Fine, tell me everything.”</p><p>“Alright.” Olivia clapped her hands before looking to Alice. “Have you told her about wolf blood?” </p><p>“I haven’t told her anything,” Alice admitted. </p><p>“Right, then I’ll do it.” Olivia looked to Rio. “Wolfblood is what makes it possible for us to transform. For most, it lays dormant until activated by a trigger. From there, it will eventually manifest into a werewolf, but a bite from another werewolf does help speed up the process.”</p><p>“But how did I get it? Is it like a virus or…”</p><p>Olivia shook her head. “You’ve always had it. Sometimes it’s inherited and sometimes it just happens. It’s something we were born with, and there’s nothing you can do to get rid of it.”</p><p>“There’s witchblood too,” Alice added. “That’s what Jen has.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “So Jen is an actual witch?”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Jen is a potions witch. She used to be part of a great coven, but they kicked her out.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Alice smiled sadly. “Because we fell in love.”</p><p>“Wait, that’s it?” Rio questioned. “Isn’t that, like, prejudice or something?”</p><p>“Witches are our natural enemy,” Olivia explained. “And while there are exceptions like Jen, you should never trust them. The minute you turn your back, they’ll kill you and grind your bones for broth.”</p><p>“No, they won’t,” Alice protested. “That’s an old wife’s tale.”</p><p>“Fine, but don’t argue with me when you wake up one morning and your girlfriend is boiling your limbs in her cauldron.”</p><p>Alice shook her head in disdain, before scooting closer to Rio. “Your wolfblood is what I could smell that night. It was so potent and sharp and…Olivia, you explain it.”</p><p>Olivia sighed. “Basically, Rio, you have alpha scent.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Alpha scent?”</p><p>“Yes, and if you have alpha scent, a pack without an alpha will be instantly drawn to you. If I’d had been wolfing out that night, I’d have been hot on your tail too.”</p><p>Rio thought for a moment. “Right, you’re going to have to explain to me what an alpha is, because I only know about it from Supernatural fanfiction.”</p><p>“The alpha is the leader,” Alice explained. “The strongest. The dominant.”</p><p>“Okay, so kind of like the fics then.” Rio lifted the blanket to look at herself, and everything seemed as it had been. “Is that why I had the…”</p><p>“Yep.” Olivia popped the P. </p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“But don’t overthink it,” Olivia insisted. “You’re still you. If anything, you’re more like yourself than ever.”</p><p>“Okay, but what about…what about the person I’m…”</p><p>“Down bad for?” Olivia offered teasingly.</p><p>“Yeah, if she was who my wolf was trying to get to, doesn’t that mean my wolf…that my wolf wants her?” </p><p>“Your wolf feels how you feel,” Alice quickly assured. “Once my wolf and managed to get back home. Jen said I rolled on the floor in front of her asking for belly rubs. If you’re a dangerous person, your wolf will be dangerous. But if you are kind and caring, your wolf will be too.”</p><p>Relief washed over her. “So I can still go near her? It’s safe?”</p><p>“You won’t hurt her, but keep your distance,” Olivia recommended. “Your wolf will be vulnerable around her, and you’re still a pup. You don’t want to accidentally transform, even if just a little.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders slumped. There goes the movie date.</p><p>Olivia got up and patted her on the shoulder. “Get dressed. I’ll get you something to take the edge off.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio grasped her clothes and changed under the blanket. Once she was done, she emerged to find Alice looking out of one of the windows, while Olivia was rummaging under the bed. </p><p>“I swear I left one under here…aha!”</p><p>Olivia slipped out from under the bed and handed over a hipflask. “There you go.”</p><p>Rio turned the metal flask over in her hand, hearing the liquid splash around within. “What is it?”</p><p>“Wolfsbane brew.”</p><p>Rio threw the flask to the end of the bed. “Wolfsbane?” </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“But that’s poisonous.”</p><p>“Not if you have wolfblood.” Olivia opened the flask and took a sip. “Take a sip a day and it’ll help keep your wolf in check. You can’t stop it from ever happening, but it keeps the wolf at bay until you’re out here and can let loose.”</p><p>“Jen makes it for us,” Alice said with a proud smile. “And they say witches are bad for us.”</p><p>“Because they are,” Olivia argued. “Come on. We need to go. I have to be on a zoom call in two hours.”</p><p>For the first time, Rio climbed out of the bed. And it was then she saw it. They were taller from the treetops, the sea of pines spreading out as far as she could see.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Alice said as they walked towards the door. “Olivia brought her truck. We knew you’d be tired after last night.”</p><p>Rio shoved the hipflask and keys into the pocket of her hoodie, before following them out onto the balcony. She cautiously stepped out onto the wooden boards, daring to look down over the railing. “Holy shit. We’re really high up.”</p><p>“Yep, and it’s a long way down.” Olivia climbed over the railing and looked back at her with a mischievous grin. “That’s why I take the short cut.”</p><p>Rio was about to question what she meant, before screaming as she watched her jump over the edge. “Fuck!”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Alice assured. “Look.” </p><p>Rio dared to look down again and saw Olivia scaling down one of the trees. “She’s crazy.” </p><p>“Yep,” Alice confirmed. “You wouldn’t think she was one of the leading experts in geopolitics.”</p><p>“She is?”</p><p>Alice nodded, before heading for the ladder leading down. “Come on. Let’s get out of here before the world starts waking up.”</p><p> </p><p>By some miracle, Rio managed to show and get changed ready to open the shop bang on time. If anything, she felt…good. Well, if it wasn’t for her hair. The thickness had gotten worse and even tying it back was becoming unmanageable. Both Alice and Olivia kept their hair reasonably short. Maybe she’d have to do the same.</p><p>She was making a customer a bouquet when the shop phone rang. Rio excused herself apologetically and answered the call.</p><p>“Vidal’s Flowers here. How can I help you?”</p><p><em>“You answer the phone so formally?”</em></p><p>Rio’s heart jumped. “Agatha?”</p><p><em>“Good guess! I thought I’d call you on the store phone, seeing as it’s, you know, working hours.”</em></p><p>“Right. Yeah. Are you at the coffee shop?”</p><p><em>“Yes, but Wanda is holding the fort. I just wanted to check see if we were still on for tonight?”</em></p><p>Rio went to agree. To tell her wild horses wouldn’t keep her away. Then she remembered Olivia’s warning. Even with the wolfsbane, there was no guarantee that even a part of her wolf didn’t come to the surface. No, she couldn’t risk it. Not right now.</p><p>“So Agatha, I-”</p><p><em>“I’ve heard the there popcorn is trash, so bring a coat with deep pockets! Meet me over here and I’ll let you pick from our Halloween stash. We’re going to make made-up trick or treat bags, so our stock room is like Willy Wonka’s factory.”</em></p><p>Rio laughed. “Don’t tell me that. I’ll be coming over all the time.”</p><p><em>“Then you most definitely need to remember that piece of information. In fact, I will keep reminding you of it. So, I’ll see you at seven?”</em></p><p>Rio knew she shouldn’t. It wasn’t worth the risk. Anything could happen. It was too public. Too close…</p><p>“Sure, I’ll be there,” she promised. “I can’t wait to see you.”</p><p><em>“Me neither,” </em>Agatha replied. <em>“We’re totally pathetic.”</em></p><p>Rio laughed again, before glancing over at her impatient-looking customer. “I’ve got to go. I’ll see you later.”</p><p><em>“You most definitely will, Vidal.”</em></p><p>When the call ended, Rio pressed her top of the phone against her forehead. She was so fucking stupid. Why couldn’t she have just said she was feeling sick or something? It seemed she was unable to say no to that woman. Perhaps Alice was right and her wolf was a mirror of her, and they were both fucking ridiculous for Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Regaining her composure, she plastered on a smile and returned to her customer with an honest apology for the wait. She finished up the bouquet and decided to close the shop for a break.</p><p>It was time she did something about her hair.</p><p> </p><p>As instructed, she arrived at the Witch’s Brew wearing her big-pocketed bomber jacked over a white t-shirt and her favourite blue jeans. It had been hard selecting an outfit, mostly because her reflection looked even stranger now with her new haircut. Still, she eventually went with a simple choice, and hoped it would be enough to keep Agatha interested.</p><p>The door was already locked, but she could see Wanda at the counter, talking to a teenage boy holding the sweeping brush. Rio knocked against the glass, and Wanda greeted her with a wave before encouraging the boy to open the door. He rushed over and let her inside.</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio gave him an awkward smile before stepping inside. She walked towards the counter, the boy following close behind. “Is Agatha here?”</p><p>“She’s just finishing up,” Wanda assured, before looking her up and down. “Your new hair looks nice.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio reached up to touch the new ends of her hair, just above her shoulders. “You guys had a good day?”</p><p>“Pretty busy, yeah.” Wanda then nodded the boy. “This is Billy. He’s doing some hours here.”</p><p>The boy, Billy, gave her a wave. “I love your flower shop. I mean, I haven’t been in it, but I like looking at it, if that makes sense?”</p><p>“Sure, kid,” Rio replied. He was an awkward little thing, with long limbs and thick black curls, and thick eyeliner circling his eyes. She smiled. If they’d have been in high school together, they’d probably have been friends.</p><p>The door to the back swung open and out came Agatha Harkness, looking as radiant as ever in a long black leather trench, holding small bags of candy. </p><p>“I grabbed us some bags. I hope you like plenty of sug-” Agatha froze, starting at her with wide eyes. “Holy shit. Your hair…you cut it.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio ran a hand through it self-consciously. “It’ll grow out but I needed a change.”</p><p>“I like it,” Agatha insisted. “You look…you look really good.”</p><p>“So do you,” Rio replied. “I mean you always look great. Like amazingly great.”</p><p>Wanda cleared her throat. “Right, you two lovebirds, get those candies in your pockets and get out of here. I want to close up.”</p><p>Rio stuffed as many bags of candy as she could into her pockets before they headed down the street to the movie theatre. Rio paid for the tickets, only to protest when Agatha tried to buy them sodas.</p><p>“I want to treat you,” she argued, but it gained her no sympathy.</p><p>“Tough,” Agatha said as she handed some cash to the kid behind the counter. “Two colas please.”</p><p>Rio relented, but she wasn’t happy about it. </p><p>Once they got their sodas, they headed into screen 1. Agatha had chosen them seats right at the back, right in the middle away from the doors. It seemed to be pretty busy, mostly filled with women their age or older. A fact Agatha seemed to find quite amusing. “When did nostalgia start making me feel old?”</p><p>“We’re not old,” Rio countered. “We’re in our prime.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> certainly are.” Agatha leaned in and whispered in her ear. “How is it you get hotter every time I see you?”</p><p>A wave of arousal washed over her, so strong that it made her practically jump out of her seat. “I’m, erm, going to go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Rio rushed out and headed to the bathroom. Locking herself in one of the stalls, she quickly searched through her candy-filled pockets until she found what she was looking for. </p><p>Olivia’s hipflask.</p><p>She opened it carefully and took a cautious sniff, wrinkling her nose at the potent herby smell. Gathering her courage, she brought the flask to her lips and took a long sip of the liquid within. The brew was bitter and burned against her tongue. So much so it took everything in her to not spit it down the toilet and instead swallowed it down with a sharp gulp.</p><p>She allowed herself to relax.</p><p>When she made it back to her seat, she took a long sip of her soda, trying to get rid of the awful taste.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked and Rio smiled in response, reaching out to take her hand.</p><p>“I’m absolutely fine.”</p><p> </p><p>By the time the film finished, Agatha had her head on her shoulder, snuggling her body against her arm. Rio never wanted to move. Agatha smelled like violets and cinnamon, and she couldn’t get enough. Yet as they watched Edward and Bella dance alone at prom before the camera panned back to reveal the scorned Victoria watching over them, she was forced to accept it was over.</p><p>When the lights came up, they gathered their things and walked out of the movie theatre arm in arm.</p><p>“I really enjoyed that,” Agatha mused as they walked back down Mainstreet. “It was fun.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio answered. “We should do it again sometime.”  </p><p>“Our date isn’t over yet, Vidal,” Agatha teased, pulling her impossibly closer. “I still need to walk you home.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t I be walking <em>you</em> home?” Rio questioned, and Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Trust me, this way round is much better.”</p><p>They soon found themselves outside of Vidal’s flowers, and Rio reluctantly pulled out of Agatha’s grasp. “Thank you for tonight. It’s been amazing.”</p><p>“It has,” Agatha agreed, before a devilish smile played on her lips. “How about we make it even better?”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio stepped closer. “And how will we do that?”</p><p>Agatha closed the last step and reached up to cup her jaw. “Like this.”</p><p>Their lips met delicately at first, so delicate that Rio thought she was about to shatter. Then Agatha’s tongue swiped against her bottom lip, and suddenly they were lost.</p><p>The kiss was everything Rio hoped it would be. Filled with burning intensity, and a desire that made her wolf howl. Everything was Agatha. Her taste. Her smell. She wanted all of it. She wanted her always.</p><p>They stayed like that until they head someone whistle across the street. Rio pulled away to see a group of guys walked by and she swiftly gave them the middle finger. “Fucking assholes.”</p><p>Agatha, however, was unfazed. She gripped the edges of Rio’s jacket, keeping her close. “Wanna take me upstairs?”</p><p>Rio nodded eagerly, scrambling to find her keys in her pocket. Eventually she caught hold of them, but as she pulled them free, something else stumbled out with them.</p><p>The hipflask hit the concrete with a metallic bang, and Rio’s stomach dropped along with it.</p><p>No. This couldn’t be happening.</p><p>Agatha, however, just laughed. “You been holding out on me, Vidal? You know, sharing is caring. But I guess we could still have a bit of fun.”</p><p>“No, Agatha. Please leave it.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her and picked up the flask, eyeing her suspiciously. “What, are you an alcoholic or something?”</p><p>“No, but please give it back. It’s not safe.”</p><p>“What do you mean it’s not safe?” Agatha began to unscrew the top. “Is it laced with something?”</p><p>“Agatha, seriously, don’t!”</p><p>Rio watched in horror as Agatha raised the rim of the flask to her face and was about to knock it from her hand when it bypassed her lips, instead resting under her nose.</p><p>Agatha sniffed and her expression instantly changed. “Wolfsbane?”</p><p>Rio frowned. How the hell did Agatha know what wolfsbane smelled like?</p><p>Agatha put the top back on the flask before waving it at her accusingly. “What the fuck are you doing carrying poison around? Are you some kind of serial killer?”</p><p>“No,” Rio insisted. “But I could ask you the same. How did you know what it was straight away?”</p><p>“I have my reasons for knowing.”</p><p>“And I have my reasons for having it,” Rio countered. “Now please can I have it back?”</p><p>She went to take it, but Agatha quickly held it behind her back, using her body to block Rio’s attempts.</p><p>“Tell me why you have it?”</p><p>“I can’t!”</p><p>“Yes, you can!”</p><p>Rio felt her fingertips tingle and quickly clenched her fists. “Agatha, please. You don’t understand. I-I need it!”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to her hands and a bitter laugh escaped her lips. “I should have known.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Don’t ‘Agatha’ me,” she hissed with an anger that made Rio flinch. “You’re a fucking werewolf, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio just stared at her, unable to come up with the words. Agatha groaned and put her head in her hands.</p><p>“Of course you fucking are. For fuck sake.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio took a step towards her, but Agatha held a hand up to stop her.</p><p>“Don’t. Did…is this some kind of trick? Did you plan all this?”</p><p>“What? No! I didn’t mean to deceive you. I-I’ve only just found out myself. Until this morning, I didn’t understand about any of this stuff. I didn’t know what to say, or if you’d believe me. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s features softened a little. “You…you have no idea who I am?”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “Really? I’m from Salem, I named my shop the witch’s brew, and my last name is Harkness. Can’t you put that together by yourself?”</p><p>Rio still remained completely clueless. Agatha huffed impatiently.</p><p>“Okay, let me spell this out for you, Vidal. I’m a witch, and I was born to kill wolves.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness knew two things from a very early age. The first was that she was to be powerful witch, and the second was that she was born to kill werewolves.</p><p>Her mother, Evanora Harkness, was a celebrated wolf killer, and so the expectation was that she would one day be the same. That she would eventually be the leader of the coven and aim to rid the world of wolfblood once and for all.</p><p>Agatha, however, thought too much. She questioned everything, always wanting to know the hows and whys. And one recurring question was what made the wolves so bad?</p><p>The first time she asked, her mother explained that they were monsters. That they had to kill them before they killed is. She accepts that in her innocence, but as she begun to learn what it took to hunt, capture and kill a werewolf, the question rose again.</p><p>This time, her mother answered with actions, not words.</p><p>Evanora had trapped a wolf in a cage and walked Agatha towards it with a firm hand on her back. “It’s time you put all you’ve learnt into practice.”</p><p>One of the coven witches opened the cage and the wolf crawled out. Agatha could tell it was young, freshly transformed. In its human form it had been a male, and she could tell it had dirty blond hair. In its wolf form, it was a skinny thing, its teeth snarling but not quite ferocious. There was no doubt it was a runt, easy to track and easy to kill.</p><p>They’d trapped it just for her.</p><p>“Well,” Evanora encouraged with a sternness that made her flinch.</p><p>Agatha let out a brutal blast of magic and watched as it hit the wolf square in the chest.</p><p>When its lifeless body hit the ground, the wolf was gone, and Agatha saw who it really was. A boy not much older than her, dead at her own hands.</p><p>Evanora had patted her on the back. “Well done, Agatha. Well done.”</p><p>After that, Agatha started going out on hunts. At first, they were small ones: tracking lone wolves and finding potential wolfbloods. That was okay. She didn’t have to kill, and most of the time there was nothing worth chasing anyway. Until her mother decided enough was enough, and she started hunting packs.</p><p>The packs were the most dangerous. They worked as one, coordinating to keep each other safe, refusing to surrender. And then, there were the alphas.</p><p>Agatha had always been fascinated by alphas. They were the strongest wolves, and so the most dangerous. Yet upon further reading, she discovered they were more than that. They were leaders, given the important task of taking care of the coven whether it be defending from threats or through guidance.</p><p>The first time she killed one, she was fifteen. It was an accident. She’d been trying to hit a different wolf, but somehow, she got the alpha square in the chest. Her mother had been so proud, but all Agatha could think about was the lifeless body on the ground. A man in his late thirties who had done her no wrong besides simply existing.</p><p>As Agatha’s magic continued to grow, her interests began to divert from her mother’s mission. It was during this time that she learned to siphon.</p><p>The first time, like her first alpha kill, had been an accident. She and another member of the coven had split off from the group to corner a wolf in a tunnel system in an old crypt. They cornered it at a dead end, ready to blast it into oblivion, but the wolf was clever, trying to run between them and out to safety. The foolish young witch had tried to blast it, only to miss and hit Agatha instead. Yet it didn’t kill her. Oh no. Instead, she feasted.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop herself. She sucked the witch dry, before unearthing a raging fireball, killing the wolf and destroying her evidence. She came up with a story of how the wolf had killed her coven sister, and how she had been so enraged that she conducted her fiery revenge. Yet as she weaved her careful lie, she couldn’t help but bask in the new level of power.</p><p>And so, she did it again.</p><p>Whenever she could, whether it be members of her own coven that she managed to isolate, or passing witches she stumbling upon along the way, she’d trick them into blasting her, and she sucked them dry. It made her stronger, capable of killing every wolf that crossed her path. Her past conscience had long gone, and for the first time in her life, her mother seemed to genuinely adore her.</p><p>Until it all came crashing down.</p><p>She had just turned eighteen, and her mother presented her with a worthy gift. They’d been tracking a particular pack for months. It was of significant size, enough that it could probably constitute as a small community. To Agatha they seemed harmless, keeping themselves to themselves and assimilated well into society. Still, they were wolves, and so they had to go.</p><p>They attacked at night fall, while the wolves were running free under a half-moon. They weren’t fully transformed, but enough to be a challenge. Agatha was bored of wolf hunts and instead used the time to try get one of the coven alone, plotting how to get her next fix.</p><p>After her coven had killed most of the pack, she followed one of the newer members of the coven. Agatha had sensed she had a great deal of power, and she was desperate for a taste. Yet during her search, she came across something else.</p><p>Her mother stood in a clearing, facing down two wolves by herself. One was fully transformed, baring its teeth, while the other remained in a human form. She was a pretty young thing, with thick brown curls and kind, beautiful face. Agatha guessed she couldn’t have been more than a few years older than her but stood before her mother with admirable bravery.</p><p>“Why have you done this? We’ve done nothing to you!”</p><p>“Your existence is enough,” Evanora spat. “Your abominations, and you will die like the vermin you are.”</p><p>The wolf growled and ran forward, but Evanora was quicker. She used her magic to throw the wolf off, blasting it in the back and knocking it to the ground. Agatha could see it was still breathing, but it was out cold.</p><p>“Pitiful,” Evanora said in disgust. “I’ve known pups fight with more control.”</p><p>“Please, don’t do this,” the woman begged. “We’ll leave. You’ll never see us again, I swear.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart beat fast. She wanted to run forward, to persuade her mother to reconsider, to show mercy.</p><p>But Evanora Harkness would never do such a thing, and she struck the woman without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha watched her fall into the dirt, the light within her extinguished.</p><p>Evanora stood over the woman, admiring her work, before laughing to herself and walking away. Agatha stayed behind the tree, watching as the other wolf began to come-to. It transformed into another young woman, this time with messy blonde hair and blue eyes like herself. With a pained sob, it crawled to the body her mother had discarded on the forest floor.  </p><p>“Babe?” She turned the body over, a broken gasp leaving her lips. “Babe, come on. You gotta wake up.”</p><p>She watched the woman shake the body, but it was no use. The wolf was already gone.</p><p>“No, no, no.” The woman sobbed. “Baby, please. Please don’t leave me.”</p><p>Agatha watched from the shadows as the woman scooped up her lover’s lifeless body, planting kisses against her skin, as if that would somehow cure the uncurable. She should have stepped out then. Should have finished the job her mother began, but instead she moved on.</p><p>In that moment, she decided to never kill again.</p><p>Her mother had been furious, of course. She had let a wounded wolf get away, and they had lost track of it on the highway. Agatha was secretly glad but made a show of apologising. A few nights later, she packed up her things and left for New York, leaving a letter telling her mother not to follow. And she didn’t, because that would mean she cared, and really, she never did.</p><p>Agatha managed to build a life for herself and found a passion for coffee and cakes and everything else that went into running a successful coffee shop. She started with a little hole-in-the-wall in a shitty neighbourhood, before going up and up, until she finally reached her goal: a successful coffee shop in Greenwich village.</p><p>And that’s how things would have stayed, if it weren’t for a day in mid-July.</p><p> </p><p>It had been a normal afternoon. The lunch-rush was over, and they had a little breathing room before the after-work coffee dates and the late-night deadline orders came flooding in. Agatha was going through the lunch receipts when the shop door opened.</p><p>“Oh no,” she heard one of her baristas say. “She’s here again.”</p><p>Agatha followed their gaze and saw Wanda walking towards the counter, dressed in yet another oversized hoodie.</p><p>Wanda was the closest thing to a best friend that Agatha had ever had. Two lone witches, they had gravitated towards each other. They had always been close, but recent tragedy had pushed them closer.</p><p>Because Wanda had done that ever foolish thing and fallen in love with Natasha, an ordinary personal trainer from Hoboken. They’d been sickly happy. The kind of happy that Agatha complained about but held slight envy for. They’d bought an apartment together, and Nat had even asked her about Wanda’s ring-size. But that had all come to an abrupt end.</p><p>Nat had died as most humans did, suddenly and without meaning. She left behind a hole in so many lives, but no one’s more than Wanda.</p><p>Yet that morning, Wanda had a slight spring in her step and greeted Agatha with a smile. “Can we talk?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and quickly made them two coffees before meeting her at a table in the corner. “Are you okay? What’s up?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Wanda assured. “Like, really this time. In fact, this is the most fine I’ve been in months.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha questioned. “How so?”</p><p>“I’ve decided to move.”</p><p>“Move?” she frowned. “Move where?”</p><p>“Back home to Westview,” Wanda answered. “I think it’s for the best. My aunt, Lilia still lives out there, and I think it would be nice being back with familiar faces. To create some new memories, you know?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. It would be good for her. To get away from it all. Still, she would certainly miss her terribly.</p><p>“That sounds like a good idea,” Agatha praised. “And it’s not too far. I can come visit whenever I get a day off from this place.”</p><p>A sheepish look appeared on Wanda’s face. “Actually, Agatha, the reason why I came here was because I was kind of wondering if you’d consider possibly…moving there with me?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her a moment. “I’m sorry. What?”</p><p>“Lilia told me there was a coffee shop up for grabs. We could make it our own, and we could stay at my parent’s old place until we get our own places.”</p><p>Agatha continued to stare, and Wanda’s shoulders slumped. “I know it’s a stupid idea, but I thought that maybe it would be good for us. A new place, a new challenge, but I do understand if…”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, let’s do it.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p> Agatha nodded, not quite believing she was agreeing to this. “Yes, seriously. Now tell me all about this coffee shop.”</p><p> </p><p>Soon, her Greenwich coffee shop was sold to a local baker, and she and Wanda used the money to buy the vacant space up in Westview. They got out of their rental agreements and packed their things into a U-Haul trailer before heading to the heart of New Jersey.</p><p>Westview was the kind of place small-town romance authors got all horny over. Quaint and quiet, surrounded by trees that had began to orange as the autumn months rolled in. To Agatha, she saw the place as one thing.</p><p>Prime werewolf territory.</p><p>She’d brought it up to Wanda, who just shrugged it off. “Lilia says there hasn’t been a wolf round here since the late 70s. Just some actual wolves and the occasional racoon.”</p><p>Agatha decided not to question it. Her wolf-hunting days were over, and she intended to keep her witchy head down…until of course Wanda had the fantastic idea to name their coffee shop ‘The Witch’s Brew’. Incognito they were not.</p><p>Still, it was all going well for the opening, and Agatha was pleased to see Wanda so happy. Everything was going smoothly, until the table décor arrived the morning of opening day, and every single crystal ball was smashed.</p><p>“I told you that company was just reselling Temu shit,” Agatha threw one of the broken pieces back in the box. “Now what are we going to do?”</p><p>“There’s some old ornamental bottles in the back,” Wanda suggested. “We could use those until for now.”</p><p>“Little bottles?” Agatha grimaced. “Yes, they really say high-quality décor.”</p><p>“Obviously not by themselves,” Wanda countered. “We could use them as, I don’t know, vases?”</p><p>Agatha glanced out of the window, towards the little flower shop across the street. She had an idea.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” she said, before racing out of the door and across the street, not wasting a breath as she barrelled into the flower shop before proclaiming, “I need flowers.”</p><p>The shop was filled with colour, and a sharp herby smell that reminded Agatha of when she used to study potions with her coven. Yet the most eye-catching thing in there was the woman behind the counter.</p><p>She was cute, with thick rimmed glasses and an adorable little nose, long brown hair in a messy ponytail, and deep brown eyes that looked to Agatha with a gleam of amusement.</p><p>“Good job you came here then.” The woman stepped out from behind the counter. “What can I get you?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t in the mood for games. “Like I said: flowers.”</p><p>The woman laughed. “Okay…what kind of flowers?”</p><p>“Any kind,” Agatha replied. “My grand opening is in three hours and the table decorations I ordered came damaged. I’ve found some old glass bottles, so I want to put some flowers in them. It isn’t what I envisioned, but it will have to do.”</p><p>“Right.” The woman looked around the shop. “What kind of place is it?”</p><p>“A coffee shop,” Agatha answered. “Just across the street.”</p><p>“Ah, so we’re neighbours. The Witch’s Brew, right?”</p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha confirmed, and that seemed to spark something in the florist, her long hands reaching all around.</p><p>“I’m thinking wildflowers. Let me see…Wild Daisies signal new beginnings, cosmos for harmony, some baby’s breath, and some aster for a splash of purple.”</p><p>Agatha looked over the selection the woman handed her and deemed them more than adequate. In fact, they would be perfect.  “Thanks, how much do I owe you?”</p><p>The woman waved her off. “Just bring me a coffee when things calm down.”</p><p>“Well, thanks…Sorry, what was your name?”</p><p>“My name? Oh, it’s, erm, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha smirked with amusement. “Are you sure about that?”</p><p>Rio nodded awkwardly. “Yeah, pretty sure.”</p><p>“Well, I’m Agatha,” she said as she walked towards the door. “Nice to meet you, neighbour.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you too,” Rio replied. “Good luck for the opening.”</p><p>Agatha winked before walked out the door. She headed back to the coffee shop with a spring in her step and handed some of the flowers to Wanda. “Crisis averted. Remind me to take the florist a coffee tomorrow.”</p><p>“Did you flirt your way into getting us some flowers?” Wanda questioned, and Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Was a pretty even split on the flirtation front.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Wanda’s eyes gleamed. “What’s she like?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “She’s…nice.”</p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Wanda rolled the name of her tongue. “So romantic.”</p><p>Agatha swatted her arm, encouraging her to get on. “Come on, you. We’re opening in an hour, and those flowers aren’t going to arrange themselves.”</p><p> </p><p>The opening was a success. The town came out in force, and soon the Witch’s Brew was buzzing with chatter. Lilia even stopped by to support them, and while Wanda was revelling in playing front of house, Agatha took the chance to sit with her a moment.</p><p>“She’s happy,” Lilia commented. “This move has been good for her.”</p><p>“It has,” Agatha agreed. “She likes it here.”</p><p>“And she likes that you’re here too,” Lilia added. “Thank you. I know you gave up your life to be here for her, and I’ll be forever grateful.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged it off. “Just trying to be a good friend.”</p><p>Lilia reached into her bag and pulled out a deck of tarot cards. “Fancy a reading?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Go on then.”</p><p>Lilia shuffled the cards until Agatha said stop, before placing three cards down on the table.</p><p>“Let’s see your past card.” Lilia turned it over. “The Fool tells me that you once walked a different path and have since changed course onto a new beginning which taught you some valuable lessons.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. She guessed she had changed paths, from wolf hunter to professional coffee brewer.</p><p>“Now your present.” Lilia turned the next card over. “The Page of Cups signifies that you’ve made a new connection, something that may potentially go deeper.”</p><p>“Does the downpayment on this place count?” Agatha joked, though her mind travelled elsewhere. Across the street to the cute florist. It was very cliché, swooning over the local flower shop owner, but it seemed Rio had made quite the impression on her.</p><p>“And as for your future.” Lilia turned the card, only for her face to drop. “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the card.</p><p>Death.</p><p>“Now it could mean a new beginning,” Lilia explained. “Or a transformation.”</p><p>“Or death,” Agatha sassed. “I suppose that will eventually be in my future.”</p><p>Lilia gathered the cards and put the deck away. “You go enjoy your grand opening. I’d best be getting back to Eastview. Those roads by the woods aren’t fun in the dark.”</p><p>Agatha gave Lilia a farewell hug before getting back to work, trying not to think too much about the cards. They were just an old card trick, even for divination witches. There would be no truth in any of it.</p><p>…right?</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Vidal’s Flowers remained closed, and by mid-morning, Agatha was becoming increasingly impatient.</p><p>“Unbelievable.” She huffed. “She’s still not open.”</p><p>“Why are you so bothered?” Wanda questioned as she cleared some of the tables. “Oh wait, you have a crush on her. How could I forget?”</p><p>“How can I have a crush on someone I’ve only spoken to for five minutes?”</p><p>“Easily,” Wanda answered, before her phone rang. She looked at the ID and frowned. “It’s Lilia. I’ll be back in a minute.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and watched her run into the back. She glanced across at the flower shop before shaking her head. Maybe small towns were just lax on opening hours.</p><p>Wanda had been gone a while and by the time she emerged, Agatha had noted the flower shop was open and bustling.</p><p>“Lilia asked if we could take on this kid she knows for part time work,” Wanda explained. “He’s a good kid and he’s, erm, like us.”</p><p>“If he fills out an application, sure,” Agatha answered. “You were gone a while. Is everything okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, Lilia has only just woken up. She spent most of last night at the hospital.”</p><p>“At the hospital?” Agatha frowned. “Why? Is she okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine, but as she was driving back last night, some woman stepped out in front of her car. She was hurt so Lilia took her to hospital.”</p><p>“Did Lilia hit her?”</p><p>“No, she was already hurt,” Wanda explained. “Attacked by an animal.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped. “An animal?”</p><p>“No, no, no.” Wanda pointed at her warningly. “Agatha Harkness, don’t you dare.”</p><p>“But Wanda…”</p><p>“No! You don’t hunt werewolves anymore. It’s probably nothing anyway. Just try not to think about it and instead focus on taking a coffee to the hot florist across the street.”</p><p>“How do you know she’s hot?”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “By the way your cheeks flushed when I mentioned her.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but got started on the coffee anyway. She went with a black coffee, taking a guess at what she would like. Definitely something strong, and stiff.</p><p>She carried it across the street and walked confidently into the flower shop. Rio was stood behind the counter and her heart leaped at the sight. Okay, maybe she did have a teeny tiny crush.</p><p>“Finally, you’re open,” Agatha said as she reached the counter. “I’ve been waiting all morning to bring you this.”</p><p>Rio looked at the coffee in surprise. “You didn’t have to…”</p><p>“It was our deal.” Agatha handed it over. “Coffee for flowers.”</p><p>Rio took a sip and frowned. “How did you know I like it black?”</p><p>“Call it barista’s intuition.” Agatha’s gaze then dropped, noting a large dressing on Rio’s forearm. “What happened there?”</p><p>“Accident,” Rio answered quickly. “Went for a run last night and got a bit banged up.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Shit! Are you okay?”</p><p>“I am,” Rio assured. “Just need to get healed up.”</p><p>“Well, I’m glad you’re okay,” Agatha said with a smile. “The flowers were a hit, by the way. I might have to come back for more.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure to keep stocked up,” Rio promised. “How did the opening go? I saw it was pretty busy when I left last night.”</p><p>“It went great,” Agatha said with a proud smile. “We’ve been run off our feet, but we know things will calm down in a day or two. After that, the real hard work begins. It’s easy getting customers when you’re shiny and new, but not so much when you become part of the landscaping.”</p><p>“You sound like you’re talking from experience?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I owned a coffee shop in Greenwich Village.”</p><p>Rio seemed surprised. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah, it was pretty successful, but I sold it to this artisan baker. My friend wanted to move back home so I came with her, and we set up the Witch’s Brew together. And before you ask: no, I’m not mad. I wanted a new challenge, and a fresh start.”</p><p>“Hey, that seems pretty reasonable to me,” Rio insisted. “I hope it gives you what you’re looking for. I don’t regret making the move, though I think my social life would be better if I’d stayed in the city.”</p><p>“Maybe we can do something about it,” Agatha said with a smirk. “Come round the Brew sometime. I know Wanda would love to meet you, and I’ll make you another coffee on the house.”</p><p>“I’ll take you up on that,” Rio promised, before raising her cup. “Thanks for this. You have no idea how much I need caffeine today.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she moved towards the door. “Anytime for a good neighbour.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy showed up the next day just before opening, a completed application in his hand. Agatha looked him up and down, taking in his Hot Topic attire and his overuse of eyeliner, and confirmed he was indeed like her and Wanda: a witch and totally fucking gay.</p><p>“Lilia’s told me a lot about you both,” he said as they sat at one of the tables. “She said you’re both powerful witches.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Wanda answered, seeming already fond for the boy. “What kind of witch are you?”</p><p>“I don’t know yet,” he admitted. “Lilia says I need to keep practicing.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Agatha noted. “So have you worked in a coffee shop before?”</p><p>“Nope,” Billy admitted and that was all Agatha needed to know.</p><p>“Good, I’ll teach you everything. Come back here tomorrow for your first shift.”</p><p>Billy blinked. “What, just like that?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “By the end of this week, I’ll have you making lattes in your sleep.”</p><p>Billy grinned from ear to ear. “This is awesome! Thank you!”</p><p>Wanda grinned back at him, while Agatha stayed with a muted smile. At least now she had someone else to clear up the tables. </p><p>At the end of the day, Agatha sat herself in the back to go over the books. Everything seemed to be going as expected, but they had to brace for a significant drop in the coming weeks. Soon they wouldn’t be that new place everyone wanted to try, and they’d have to get customers in the door by staying current on trends and retaining a high standard of service.</p><p>She was going over the expenses when Wanda barrelled through. “Agatha, you need to come out here.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha jumped to her feet. “Why? What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothings happened,” Wanda assured. “The shop is fine.”</p><p>Agatha covered her face with her hands. “Don’t scare me like that!”</p><p>“I’m sorry but Rio is stood at the counter right now.”</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha questioned. “As in flowershop Rio?”</p><p>“Yes, now get your butt out there and talk to her!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need telling twice. She walked out with Wanda, eager to see her favourite florist once more. And oh, was she not disappointed. Somehow, Rio looked better than ever, even in a hoodie and leggings.</p><p>“Rio.” She moved round the counter to meet her. “This is a nice surprise.”</p><p>“I did promise I’d stop by,” Rio replied. “Nice place you have here.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha looked back to Wanda. “I’ll make Rio’s order. Cancel it off the register. It’s on the house.”</p><p>“Sure it is.” Her best friend smirked. “I’m Wanda, by the way. It’s nice to put a face to the name this one won’t shut up about.”</p><p>“Rio, why don’t you go sit down,” Agatha quickly suggested, wanting to get her away from Wanda as soon as possible. “I’ll get your order ready for you.”</p><p>As soon as Rio was out of earshot, she gave Wanda a warning look. “Why the fuck did you do that?”</p><p>“Oh lighten up.” Wanda held up a piece of note paper. “This is her order.”</p><p>Agatha snatched it and began getting it together, muttering under her breath.</p><p>As soon as it was all ready, she got everything on a tray and carried it over to the table Rio had sat herself at. Rio stood to help her, but Agatha didn’t need it. She was a pro at this by now.</p><p>“I thought I’d join you, if that’s okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’d love the company.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and sat down opposite her. She was excited to spend some actual time together, even if it was under Wanda’s watchful gaze. Yet Rio’s attention seemed to be fixed on the cinnamon roll, and soon enough it was completely devoured.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m guessing you were hungry?”</p><p>Rio blushed adorably as she nodded. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t apologise,” Agatha assured. “I’m guessing by the way you inhaled it that you liked it?”</p><p>“It was delicious. Seriously, Agatha, this place is amazing.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha took a sip of her cocoa, taking the time to study Rio once more. Something had changed for sure. Her features seemed sharper, stronger. She just couldn’t put her finger on exactly why. “You seemed different.”</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah, you look good.”</p><p>“I do?” Rio repeated, and Agatha wanted to kiss her right there and then for being so adorable.</p><p>“Did you get highlights in your hair?”</p><p>“Y-yeah.” Rio touched the ends of her hair. “Do they look okay?”</p><p>“Very nice.” Agatha then decided the ice was broken enough to go deeper. “So, Rio, I have some questions.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“My first being what brought you to Westview? Wanda said she doesn’t remember you, so you must have moved here recently.”</p><p>“I moved here just over a year ago. Before then I was living in New York, nut I’m originally from Delaware. What about you? I mean, I know you lived in New York too, but was somewhere else home before then?”</p><p>Oh great.</p><p>“Okay, promise not to laugh.”</p><p>Rio held up her hand. “Scouts honour.”</p><p>Agatha knew she just had to say it. “Well, I’m actually from Salem.”</p><p>Rio’s surprise was obvious. “Salem? As in Salem, Massachusetts?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Hence the Witch’s Brew.”</p><p>“Did you like it there?”</p><p>“Not much,” Agatha admitted, the memories flooding by her eyes. Of her first kill, of the hours of training turning her into a killing machine, before she turned herself into an even greater one. “My mother still lives there, which is why I don’t. We don’t have the best of relationships. Do you see much of your parents?”</p><p>Rio reached for her own mug and took a large swig. “No, they died when I was a kid.”</p><p>Agatha Harkness, you fucking idiot.</p><p>“Shit, Rio, I…”</p><p>“It’s alright,” Rio quickly assured. “I don’t remember them, really. I was too little. My Abuela raised me, so she was pretty much both parents rolled into one. She died a few years ago. She’s the person who encouraged my love for plants and flowers, so I used the money she left me to start up the shop. I couldn’t afford a place in the city, so I made the plunge and moved here.”</p><p>“It is a cute town,” Agatha mused. “When Wanda persuaded me to move up here, I was dubious, but I do like it. Especially the company.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>They chatted until closing, and Rio insisted on staying to help clean, a gesture Agatha greatly appreciated, only to regret when Wanda started digging for intel. The confirmation Rio was single was good though. It gave her a spark of confidence, and she decided not to waste it.</p><p>And so, as they talked on the sidewalk while Wanda finished locking up, she decided to just go for it.</p><p>“They’re showing <em>Twilight </em>at the movie theatre tomorrow night, and I was wondering if you wanted to go?”</p><p>“As friends, or…”</p><p>“Or…” Agatha couldn’t help but grin. “What do you say?”</p><p>Rio’s reply was instant. “I say I’d fucking love to.”</p><p>“Great. Pick me up at seven.”</p><p>“Ah, you’ve set a date,” Wanda commented as she joined them outside. “Finally. I was sick of the pinning, and it’s only been a couple of days.”</p><p>Agatha elbowed her, but it only made her laugh. “Come on, Aggie. I want to get started on dinner.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and gave Rio apologetic look. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “At seven o’clock sharp.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha followed Wanda down the street, looking back at Rio as she went. “Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight Agatha.”</p><p>Reluctantly, she moved to walk at Wanda’s side, stealing a glance over her shoulder as she went, seeing Rio cross the road towards her shop.</p><p>“Look at you, asking girls out on a date,” Wanda teased, but Agatha didn’t rise to it. The date was going to be perfect, she just knew it.</p><p> </p><p>And it was. The perfect greeting, the perfect movie, the perfect walk home, the perfect kiss. Everything was perfect, until Rio went and pulled out her fucking keys.</p><p>Which led them to that current moment. Sat in Rio’s apartment, sharing each other’s stories.</p><p>Rio had already told hers, recalling the bite and the change, and the wolfsbane she had foolishly brought to the movies with her. And Agatha had just finished her much longer tale, her hands dripping the leather arms of Rio’s tub-chair as she tried to push the old demons out of her mind.</p><p>“So?” Agatha questioned, looking over to where Rio leant against her kitchen counter. “Say something.”</p><p>“What do you want me to say?”</p><p>“Something,” Agatha huffed. “Just…tell me what you’re thinking?”</p><p>“Alright.” Rio stepped towards her. “I’m sorry that your mom did that to you.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “That’s all you took from that? Not that once I would have killed you without a second thought? Not that I’d have fucking <em>enjoyed</em> it?”</p><p>Rio continued to approach. “That wasn’t you.”</p><p>“Yes, it was me,” Agatha barked, getting to her feet. “You don’t know me, Rio.”</p><p>“Yes, I do.” The young wolf stood before her, big brown eyes searching her face. “I don’t understand it, but you’re all I think about. Everything in me screams for you. My wolf screams for you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed sharply, trying to ignore the heat simmering in the bit of her stomach. “We can’t do this.”</p><p>Rio cocked an eyebrow. “Are you telling me that or yourself?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. Why did Rio have to be so hot? “We can’t.”</p><p>“We can,” Rio insisted, cupping Agatha’s cheek with the gentlest of touches. “Fuck the covens and fuck the packs. I don’t care about any of that. All I care about is you.”</p><p>Agatha tried to stay strong, she really did, but those big brown eyes just dragged her down. She couldn’t help herself. She pulled Rio into a heated kiss, and then there was no going back.</p><p>They stumbled into the bedroom, Agatha grasping at Rio like a woman possessed. She had already successfully got her shirt off, but what she really wanted was those jeans off and on the floor. She pushed Rio away from her and onto the bed, unbuttoning the front of her jeans before yanking them down her legs.</p><p>Clothed Rio was hot, but bare Rio was downright sinful.</p><p>“This isn’t fair,” Rio complained. “You’re still dressed.”</p><p>Agatha gestured to her obvious lack of shirt. “Can I remind you that you ripped my favourite shirt open in the hallway?”</p><p>“I’ll sow every button back on myself,” Rio promised. “Now come on.”</p><p>“So desperate,” Agatha teased, before making quick work of her own clothes. Before she even had chance to get her panties off her foot, strong hands grasped her hips and dragged her onto the bed. Her body met Rio’s, and she could hardly savour the touch before Rio’s greedy mouth latched onto her breast.</p><p>She moaned, cupping Rio’s head to keep her in place. “Your mouth is fucking perfect.”</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was on her back, and Rio’s body was sliding down her. She grasped her hair, pushing her further, before grasping it in a fist as Rio’s lips quickly met her core.</p><p>Rio didn’t just eat her out. No, she devoured her. Her tongue, her lips. Agatha couldn’t get enough of her mouth. She pushed up into her, thrusting against her eager tongue as it dipped in and out of her.</p><p>“Keep going,” she demanded as pressure began to build in her core. “So good for me. My good little wolf.”</p><p>Rio moaned against her and Agatha arched her back, gripping Rio’s hair tighter. She thrust up harder, taking all Rio had to give, until she finally snapped.</p><p>Pleasure washed over in, wrecking her like a hurricane, encouraged by Rio’s eager licks. Jolts of pleasure continued to shoot through her until she had no more to give, and the talented tongue became a source for warm contentment.</p><p>When she came down, Agatha looked to see Rio’s brown eyes staring up at her from between her thighs. She loosened the hand in her hair and lazily slid it down to hold Rio’s cheek. And in that moment, she knew she was well and truly fucked.</p>

<p>Rio woke up at the first peek of sunlight. She tried to lie there, to wait until her alarm before getting up, but lately she had been struggling keeping still, and ended up just rolling around under the sheets.</p><p>Which would be fine if she was by herself, but she wasn’t.</p><p>“Will you stop moving?” Agatha huffed behind her. “Sometimes I feel like I <em>am </em>sleeping with a dog.”</p><p>Despite her protests, the moment Rio rolled over to face her, Agatha was quick to snuggle against her chest.</p><p>Rio kissed the witch’s crown. “Good morning.”</p><p>“Morning.” Agatha placed an equal kiss against her neck. “Last night was fun.”</p><p>“I thought every night was fun?”</p><p>Agatah hummed. “Yes, but especially last night.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself, taking in that precious scent of cinnamon. It had been just over a week, and she and Agatha hadn’t spent a night apart, unable to tame the overwhelming desire that had taken hold of them that fateful night. The night they found out who they truly were and gave in to the pull that had plagued them both for so long.</p><p>“You smell so nice.”</p><p>“So do you,” Agatha mumbled. “Like campfire apples.”</p><p>“Campfire apples?” Rio chuckled. “That’s very specific.”</p><p>“But it’s true.” Agatha snuggled further into her. “I love waking up like this.”</p><p>“Yeah, me too.”</p><p>“Do you have to go with the wolves tonight?” Agatha whined. “Can’t you just take your brew and ride it out with me?”</p><p>“It’s a full moon,” Rio reminded her. “It’s a big deal, and I don’t want them to get suspicious.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled. “Just tell them you have a woman in need of your attention. It’s no big deal. Wanda knows we’re dating.”</p><p>“No, Wanda knows you’re dating me, a wolf. There’s a difference. And I don’t want shit of Olivia for going against her advice.”</p><p>“But you said this Alice’s girlfriend is a witch. Surely it would be hypocritical if they treated us differently?”</p><p>“The difference is that your mother is an infamous wolf-killer,” Rio reminded her. “Olivia doesn’t like witches anyway, but if they find out I’ve even been anywhere near you, they’ll flip.”</p><p>“So what? You’re just going to lie?”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio answered. “And as soon as I know how to control my powers, I’m cutting loose. I meant what I said, Agatha. I don’t give a fuck about having a pack. Sure, I’m meant to be the alpha but…”</p><p>Agatha shot up. “Wait, what?”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned.</p><p>“You’re an alpha?”</p><p>“Alice thinks I am.” Rio shrugged it off. “Makes no difference to me.”</p><p>“This makes a huge fucking difference,” Agatha insisted. “Wait, so when you transform, you get a…”</p><p>“Apparently I did the first time,” Rio admitted. “But nothing’s happened since. I haven’t really let loose again though.”</p><p>Rio had been meeting Alicia and Olivia for a few hours a night, learning how to control the wolf. She’d managed to get it to a point where she could minimize the physical effects, and her ‘pack’ had praised her quick study.</p><p>“Typical alpha,” Olivia had teased. “Picks up everything right away.”</p><p>Yet tonight would be different. Tonight, she was going to let the wolf free, and who knew what would happen…</p><p>“You know, it makes sense,” Agatha mused. “Sure, wolves get some extra muscle mass when they turn, but yours is pretty ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and got out of bed. “Come on. You need to get up for work.”</p><p>“Will you come over for coffee before you open the shop?” Agatha asked hopefully, and Rio smiled.</p><p>“Like you even need to ask?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked into the Witch’s Brew with her head held high and Rio holding her hand.</p><p>They hadn’t said what they were, but Agatha just knew that for now, Rio was hers, and she didn’t care who knew it. Rio was a bit more apprehensive, but she never shied away from physical contact. In fact, she seemed to crave it.</p><p>Wanda had already opened up, and was behind the counter waiting when they arrived</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t the Westview lovebirds.”</p><p>“Morning, Red.” Agatha walked around the counter. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“All good.” Wanda then smiled at Rio. “Expecting a busy day today, Rio?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Will have to see what the day brings.”</p><p>Agatha made Rio a coffee to go and bagged up some pastries. “There you go. Don’t gobble it all at once.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio gave her a quick peck on the lips. “I’ll stop by later.”</p><p>“Oh I’m counting on it,” Agatha called after her, watching with a smile as Rio left to head back to her own shop.</p><p>She heard Wanda laughed beside her and set her face in a warning glower. “What’s so funny?”</p><p>“You,” Wanda giggled. “You’re smitten.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I am not.”</p><p>“Yes, you are,” Wanda insisted. “The only time you two have been spent apart has been during work hours and even then, she’s over here every five minutes. I swear she eats more of our pastries than the actual paying customers.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Agatha huffed and tried to concentrate on setting up the pastry cabinet. Rio did take a lot of feeding, but they had more than enough, and what was the point of letting out all go to waste?</p><p>Wanda, however, pressed on. “Seriously, you’ve hardly been home in over a week. It’s like you’ve already U-Hauled.”</p><p>“Well, I’ll be home with you tonight,” Agatha assured. “Rio is meeting some friends, so you have me all to yourself.”</p><p>“Rio’s going out on a full moon?” Wanda questioned with a chuckle. “You sure she’s not a werewolf?”</p><p>Agatha knew it was a joke, so smiled stiffly in reply. “Very funny, Maximoff. Very funny.”</p><p>Billy showed up mid-afternoon, after she’d stopped by the flower shop to deliver Rio her lunch (in exchange for a kiss). They were both working on clearing a line of tables used for a large soccer mom meeting.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Why do witch’s hunt werewolves?”</p><p>Agatha stole a glance over her shoulder, checking no one was in earshot. “Why do you ask that, kid?”</p><p>“I was on a Reddit group for young witches, and someone started talking about gathering a group to hunt werewolves. They got a load of hate for it, but some people were defending them. Saying they’d do the same to us. I did more research, and found out all about the hunting covens and famous battles, but I couldn’t find the reason why it all started?”</p><p>“Because people hate difference,” Agatha answered. “And there is no difference like a witch and a wolf.”</p><p>Billy frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Witches go against the limits of nature, while wolves give in to its most primal form. One wants to gain knowledge, the other physical strength. One threatens the world view of the other, and that tends to rub people the wrong way.”</p><p>“But surely it wouldn’t be fair,” Billy argued. “Witchcraft is so broad and complex. The wolves wouldn’t stand a chance.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to laugh. “I’ve seen witches be ripped limb from limb without a wolf breaking a sweat.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened. “Seriously?”</p><p> Agatha nodded. “Throw a snake into a ring with a wolf, and they’ll both end up dead. One by claws and one by poison.”</p><p>“So it’s a losing war? Neither is able to win?”</p><p>“I guess not, no.”</p><p>“Why don’t they try make a truce?” Billy suggested. “End all this before anyone else has to die.”</p><p>“Because it runs too deep,” Agatha answered. “I agree with you, Billy, but I didn’t always. It would take every coven to step down, and every pack to not seek revenge. It’ll never happen.”</p><p>“What do you mean you didn’t always?” Billy questioned, before his eyes widened. “Where you a wolf hunter?”</p><p>Agatha pilled up the plates and handed them to him. “Go take these to the kitchen.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Now, Billy,” Agatha commanded with a warning tone. “And I want to hear no more of this.”</p><p>Billy bowed his head and walked towards the kitchen, leaving Agatha to clear up the rest of the mess. She shook her head. She was officially sick of werewolf drama.</p><p> </p><p>Rio met Alice and Olivia at the bottom of the Firewatch tower. Olivia had given her directions on where to park, and so the Vidal Flowers delivery van sat beside Olivia’s truck somewhere to the west, her newly impressive sprint carrying her the rest of the way.</p><p>Olivia and Alice were already waiting for her, and both smiled when she approached.</p><p>“Here she is.” Olivia clapped her hands. “The woman of the hour. You ready for this?”</p><p>“I’ve done it before,” Rio reminded her. “I can control it now. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Whatever you say.” Olivia looked up at the full moon rising above the treetops. “There she is.”</p><p>Rio could feel her wolf fighting within her, desperate to get out. She stripped off her clothes and folded them into the duffle bag Alice had brought along, before she hid it under the tower. If anyone saw the three of them now, naked in the moonlight, they’d think them mad.</p><p>If they saw what happened next, they’d think themselves mad.</p><p>“Okay then.” Alice sucked in a deep breath and closed her eyes. “Let’s let them loose.”</p><p>Rio followed her lead, closing her eyes, and finally letting go.</p><p>This time the transformation was quick, her body accepting the change, and her wolf was finally freed.</p><p>She could recall flickers of that night. Of her running alongside two wolves, of them playing in the moonlight, running across streams, and chasing small animals through the trees. In those flickers, Rio felt something she had never experienced before. Totally and unquestionably freedom</p><p>That was until the moon began to fall, and by the time they made it back to the tower, they were once again in their human forms. Still in their haze, they decided not to change straight away, instead choosing to scale the tower bare and stumbling onto the small bed in the cabin in a mess of tired limbs.</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Rio said breathlessly. “That was amazing.”</p><p>“It was,” Alice agreed. “I love the full moon.”</p><p>“Best fucking day of the year,” Olivia said before getting up. “But sorry, ladies. It’s too fucking cold to be furless, so the clothes have to go back on.”</p><p>Rio watched as Olivia reached up to switch on the camping lantern, illuminating the room in a sharp yellow glow.</p><p>It was then she saw it.</p><p>Scar tissue covered Olivia’s back like a web, stretching outward from a spot on her right side. Each stem was jagged like lightning, and she couldn’t help but wonder if that was what had caused it, or if it had been something else.</p><p>Rio studied it curiously, until Alice jabbed her in the ribs.</p><p>“Don’t stare,” she whispered.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“I know, but don’t.”</p><p>Olivia looked over her shoulder. “You two are terrible whisperers.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” they said in union, but Olivia didn’t seem too upset. She pulled on her clothes before throwing the duffle bag towards them.</p><p>“I’m not telling this story when you two are still naked.”</p><p>They made quick work of changing back into their clothes and moved to sit cross legged on the wooden floorboards of the floating cabin.</p><p>“It happened a long time ago,” Olivia explained. “Back with my own pack. My parents didn’t know I was a wolfblood you see, and they sent me to boarding school thinking my constant acting out was a sign I needed more structured discipline. It was torturous at first, but I learnt to enjoy it. and that was where I met Honey. She was a southern bell, sent to England by her rich dad who caught her with the pastor’s daughter. She was a wolf too, but she was from a line of wolfbloods, so had learned to transform from a young age. She could sense the wolfblood in me, and suddenly everything made sense. The inability to keep still, the impulsive decisions, the sudden bouts of anger. She held me change and taught me everything I know about being wolf. Along the way, we fell in love, and when we graduated, I moved here to be with her. For a while, we were very happy, until<em> that</em> night.”</p><p>“What happened?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Witches,” Olivia answered. “They killed everyone, and I think they thought they’d killed me as well, but I survived. Injured but alive. I woke up and found my love dead on the ground. I tried to revive her, but it was no use. So I ran as far as I could, keeping my wolf bottled up along with my emotions. I started going down a bad path, but then I met Alice, and I decided enough was enough. I needed people and I needed my wolf. Things got better. I did well for myself, and had a few flings here and there, but nothing significant. My heart, after all, belongs to another, and always will. Even though she wasn’t my mate, she was the love of my life, and no one could every replace her.”</p><p>“What do you mean she wasn’t your mate?” Rio questioned. “Is there a ritual you have to perform for that or something?”</p><p>“Mates aren’t something you choose,” Alice explained. “It just happens. At first you don’t realise it, then its totally consumed you. After that, you can’t bare to be away from them, and you’d do anything to keep them safe. That’s how it is with me and Jen, anyway.”</p><p>“See, I’d have done all those things,” Olivia said sadly. “She was my entire world, but I never scented her. It was like something inside was blocking me from giving myself fully to her, and I think she felt the same.”</p><p>“Scented her?” Rio questioned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“When you meet you mate, you become attune to their scent,” Alice explained. “Only you can smell it, but it helps to sooth your wolf and find them should they ever get lost.”</p><p>Rio thought back to that morning, of how Agatha smelled on cinnamon and she couldn’t get enough of it. She guessed that was expected though, seeing as Agatha worked with cinnamon spice all day. If anything, it would be odd if she didn’t smell that way.</p><p>She quickly brought her thoughts back to the conversation at hand. “So the scar is from magic? From a witch?”</p><p>Olivia nodded. “And now you know why I don’t trust them.”</p><p>“But Alice is dating a witch?” Rio questioned. “Are you okay with that?”</p><p>“I’m not entirely comfortable with Jen,” Olivia admitted. “But she’s a good person. She’s not a hunter. She helps people, even people like us. Most witches aren’t like that, and even if they are now, they likely haven’t always been. Alice can’t help it, but you need to stay as far away from them as possible.”</p><p>Rio responded with a stiff smile, already counting down the time until she could head home. Back to Agatha, where she wouldn’t be conflicted at every turn.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked into the Witch’s Brew just before opening, and Agatha rushed to meet her. She jumped into the wolf’s waiting around and buried her face in her neck.</p><p>“You’re here!”</p><p>“I am,” Rio confirmed, holding her just as desperately. “I’ve missed you.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha admitted. She’d missed her so much. Even if she had enjoyed spending time with Wanda and got to wake up to her alarm clock instead of getting accidentally kicked by restless legs, she had missed Rio’s voice, her warmth, her smell.</p><p>She never wanted to be away from her ever again.</p><p>“How was it?” She asked as she pulled back, her hands still gripping on to Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>“It was good,” Rio answered. “How was your night in with Wanda?”</p><p>“Good too. Do you want a coffee?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “And pastries. Lots and lots of pastries.”</p><p>She soon made sure Rio was fed and watered, before sending her off to get to work, much to the wolf’s pouting protested. Wanda had laughed at the entire display and only laughed more when Agatha gave her a disapproving look.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha. It’s just too funny. Your girlfriend is such a brat.”</p><p>“One, she’s not a brat and secondly, she’s not my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.”</p><p>“I’m serious, Wanda. She’s not my girlfriend. I don’t date like that.”</p><p>“You are,” Wanda insisted, a seriousness appearing in her tone. “Stop denying things like that. You never know how much time you have and wasting it trying to be unbothered will only leave you with regrets.”</p><p>Agatha instantly felt like an asshole.</p><p>“Wanda, I’m sorry…”</p><p>“Don’t be sorry,” Wanda insisted. “I’m happy for you, honestly. I just miss it, you know. I miss her.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha agreed. “But I think she’d want us both to be happy.”</p><p>“I suppose, but I’m not ready for any of that yet. I’m just happy to be with the people I care about, and watching you fall in love is an added bonus.”</p><p>“I’m not…”</p><p>Wanda covered her ears. “Lalala. Not listening to your denial anymore.”</p><p>Agatha threw a dishcloth at her and soon they both descended into giggles.</p><p>Billy was working in the afternoon again, and once more he managed to corner her.</p><p>“I did more research, and I found out about a coven in Massachusetts. The leader is a woman named Evanora Harkness. Are you related to her?”</p><p>“Distantly,” Agatha lied. “Though I want nothing to do with her.”</p><p>“Is that why you used the think differently about wolves? Because of her.”</p><p>Agatha moved to clear a table, hoping it would deter the boy from continuing. Instead, he simply followed her.</p><p>“But you changed your mind,” he pressed. “Maybe we could help change even more minds. Both werewolves and witches, then we could form peace. One pack and coven at a time.”</p><p>“Wishful thinking, kid,” Agatha said as she wiped down a table. “But it’ll never happen.”</p><p>“I think we can make it happen,” Billy insisted. “I could hear howls from the woods last night. There must be werewolves either here or in Eastview. Maybe if we just spoke to them…”</p><p>“Don’t go looking for werewolves, kid,” Agatha told him sternly. “That’s just looking for trouble.”</p><p>“Maybe we could still try…”</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha snapped. “I don’t want to hear it anymore.”</p><p>“But I think…”</p><p>“No! I’m serious, Billy. You’re too young to understand any of this, and I don’t want to hear about the naïve thoughts of a silly little boy.”</p><p>Billy’s face screwed up in anger, and for a moment Agatha worried she’d have a magical explosion on her hands. Instead, he ripped off his apron and threw it down on the table.</p><p>“I quit!”</p><p>Agatha watched him storm out before running her hands over her face. Kids these days.</p><p>Wanda quickly rushed to her side.</p><p>“What the hell did you say to him?” she demanded.</p><p>“The truth,” Agatha answered. “He just didn’t like hearing it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed up the flower shop and hopped across the road to see Agatha. Like always, she was greeted by that intoxicating smell of cinnamon and the co-owners waiting arms.</p><p>“I’m so excited for tonight,” Agatha mused as they held each other close. “I missed you so much last night.”</p><p>“You have me tonight,” Rio promised. “We will do whatever you want.”</p><p>“I want to go straight to bed,” said without hesitation. “We have so much time to make up for.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “You, me, and your favourite strap. We’re going to have a whale of a time.”</p><p>Rio grinned and went to kiss her, only for her phone to chime. She checked the ID and frowned. It was Alice.</p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>Emergency! Come to the tower now!</em></p><p>Shit.</p><p>“I’ve got to go.”</p><p>“What? Now?” Agatha questioned. “Why? What’s happened?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but Alice said it was an emergency.”</p><p>Agatha frowned for a moment before her eyes widened in horror. “Oh fuck.”</p><p>“What?” Rio searched her face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“I told him not to go chasing wolves,” Agatha huffed before storming towards the back of the shop. “Wanda, get your coat. We’re going to the woods.”</p><p>Before long, Rio was walking the two witches towards the Firewatch tower, listening to them bicker behind her.</p><p>“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me you were dating a <em>werewolf</em><em>!</em>” Wanda said for the umpteenth time. “Though I should have known. You’re kind of obsessed.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Sorry for having a special interest, and in my defence, I didn’t know Rio was a werewolf until after we kissed.”</p><p>“But you still had sex with her after?”</p><p>“Of course I did. She’s gorgeous.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile at that but quickly cleared her throat to bring down the tone. “We’re coming up to the tower now. Just follow my lead.”</p><p>She stepped ahead of them, walking to the foot of the tower and staring up at the suspended cabin far above.</p><p>“Olivia!” she called up. “Alice! It’s Rio! You need to bring the kid down!”</p><p>There were a few loud bangs, and soon Olivia jumped to the ground in front of her. No pleasantries were exchanged, just an eyebrow cocked in challenge.  “How did you find out about the kid?”</p><p>“Because I fucking know him,” Rio admitted. “He’s stupid but harmless.”</p><p>Olivia laughed bitterly. “Harmless? He’s a witch. He could never be harmless.”</p><p>“She has a point there,” Agatha added and Rio shot her a warning look. This wasn’t a game. They couldn’t risk pushing Olivia too far.</p><p>Olivia looked between Agatha and Wanda before her eyes fixed on Rio with narrowed eyes. “You brought witches here? Seriously?”</p><p>“I brought them to take the boy,” Rio answered. “You don’t need him. Hand him over and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>“We can’t let him go,” Olivia insisted. “He’s a threat to the pack.”</p><p>“He just wants to build bridges,” Wanda cut in. “He was just trying to do what he thinks is the right thing.”</p><p>Olivia stared at Wanda a moment before shaking her head. “This is pack territory. We can’t have witches wandering through here whenever they want, even if they’re pups.”</p><p>“He’s just curious,” Rio argued. “He never did anything wrong.”</p><p>“He’s a witch,” Olivia argued. “He was born wrong.”</p><p>Agatha charged forward before Rio could stop her and soon was right in Olivia’s face. “Don’t you dare speak of him like that.”</p><p>“Defensive over your little pup, are we?” Olivia taunted. “What are you going to do, little witch? Tickle me with a coffee brew?”</p><p>“Foolish wolf,” Agatha sneered. “You have no idea who you’re talking to.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Wanda said warningly, and Rio began to edge towards her.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Olivia questioned “Then enlighten me.”</p><p>“I’m a Harkness,” Agatha declared. “I used to kill wolves like you before breakfast.”</p><p>Olivia lunged for Agatha, but Rio was quick on her feet. She pushed Olivia back and inserted herself between them.</p><p>“If you want to hurt her, Olivia, you have to go through me.”</p><p>“Why are you defending her?” Olivia questioned, before realisation crossed her face. “Wait, she’s the girl, isn’t she? The one you mentioned. First Alice, now you! And with a Harkness no less! You might have well just signed all three of our death warrants.”</p><p>“No, I haven’t,” Rio insisted. “Because from now on, we’re going to be at peace.”</p><p>Olivia laughed. “Oh yeah? And how do you see that happening?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’m the alpha, remember. I’m in charge. I’ve made the decision for the pack. No more fighting, so I need you to let the boy go.”</p><p>“You’re really pulling alpha rank on <em>that?”</em></p><p>“Yes,” Rio answered. “I may be a pup but I’m still an alpha, and I know exactly what I’m doing.”</p><p>Olivia stepped closer, and Rio braced herself for a fight, yet instead the wolf leaned in close. “She’ll turn on you, you know.”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Rio answered. “Now let the boy go.”</p><p>Olivia stepped back, a defeated expression on her face. “He’s already on his way down.”</p><p>As though on cue, Billy raced down the last section of steps, Alice right behind him. He towards them, a huge grin on his face. “It’s so cool up there! You can see everything!”</p><p>Rio shook her head. She should have known. Of course those two did nothing to him.</p><p>Agatha stormed forward. “What the hell did you think you were doing chasing wolves?”</p><p>“I wanted to make peace,” Billy admitted. “When you told me I couldn’t, I just got so mad that I had to try. Olivia caught me, of course, and took me up there so I couldn’t run.”</p><p>“But are you alright?” Wanda questioned. “You’re not hurt or anything?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Billy assured. “Alica and I were playing cards.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Big scary wolves indeed.”</p><p>“I hope you’re happy, Rio,” Olivia sneered as backed away from them. “Let’s see how long it is before she gets a taste for wolfblood.”</p><p>Rio watched Olivia take off into the darkness. She understood her anger, but she wouldn’t change her stance.</p><p>“She’ll come around,” Alice assured. “She was like this with Jen at first. It’s a lot of trauma for her.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. “Are you okay? With this, I mean.”</p><p>“It’s a shock, but I understand,” Alice assured. “And Jen will be glad to go on double-dates with another witch-werewolf couple.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha and smiled, taking her hand. “We’d like that.”</p><p>Wanda put her hands on her hips. “So now the truth is out, will you two please admit you’re girlfriends? I’m sick of the denial.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and kissed Agatha’s forehead. “If the lady wishes?”</p><p>“Oh the lady wishes,” Agatha said before kissing her cheek. “You’re not getting rid of me now, Vidal.”</p><p>With a grin, she kissed her girlfriend sweetly. It seemed there was finally nothing in their way. No more worries and no more hiding. Now, everything was calm.</p><p>If only that could last</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was the week of Halloween, and the entire town was ready to celebrate. Rio had ordered some pumpkins from a farm up north, and they’d been an absolute hit, while Agatha’s spooky shakes were the latest craze for kids and adults alike.</p><p>Things were good overall, actually. Rio had made amends with Olivia, and they all agreed to call a truce with Agatha’s coven, which quickly began to include Jen also. It was like they were all one big dysfunctional family trying their best to live their truths while hiding away from the unsuspecting humans.</p><p>It was the first time in a long time that Rio felt as though she truly belonged, no longer stuck or feeling like life would just pass her by. She had her pack, she had the coven, and most importantly, she had Agatha. Everything was perfect, and she swore she’d never been so happy in her entire life.</p><p>After a busy morning at the flower shop, Rio stopped by the Witch’s Brew during her lunch break, and like always was greeted by a sweet kiss from its gorgeous co-owner.</p><p>“You always smell so good,” she commented as they walked to the counter. “Do you like bathe in cinnamon or something?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Maybe it’s all the batches of cinnamon rolls I have to keep baking because someone keeps inhaling every batch”</p><p>Rio blushed, but she didn’t deny it. Those cinnamon rolls were fucking delicious, and the fact they were made by her girlfriend’s own hands made them all the more special.</p><p>Agatha was about to make her a coffee when the door opened, and Deputy Bohner walked in. He strode confidently to the counter and took off his hat to greet them, yet his eyes were fixed on Agatha. “Hello ladies.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a tight smile. “What can I get you officer?”</p><p>“Deputy,” he corrected her. “And a black coffee with a splash of milk will do.”</p><p>“A black coffee with milk,” Agatha repeated, and Rio had to bite her lip as not to laugh. “Coming right up.”</p><p>Deputy Bohner smirked to himself as Agatha turned around, obviously checking her out. Rio clenched her fists. She wanted to punch him in the face.</p><p>His eyes then landed on her. “Ms Vidal, hello again.”</p><p>Rio gave him an acknowledging nod. “Deputy Bohner.”</p><p>He looked her up and down. “You seemed to have recovered well.”</p><p>“Pretty much,” she answered. “Just a few lingering side-effects, but nothing I can’t handle.”</p><p>“Well, there’s no sign of the animal that attacked you,” he admitted. “I even went scouting on my day off, but the only track I could find were human. Must be a new trend with hiking barefoot. Stupid idea if you ask me.”</p><p>Rio forced a smile. “It was probably just an unfortunate accident. Both of us in the wrong place at the wrong time. No need to worry yourself over it too much.”</p><p>“How can I not?” he questioned. “I have the safety of Eastview to think of, and Westview in turn. I promise you, Ms Vidal. I will not rest until the beast is dead.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Agatha slammed a to go cup down on the counter. “There you go, officer.”</p><p>“Thanks, ma’am. If I knew someone as beautiful as you worked here, I’d have been stopping by every morning.” Deputy Bohner winked at her, and Rio wanted to rip his head off.</p><p>Once he was gone, she grumbled under her breath. “I hate it when men are like that, especially with you.”</p><p>“They’re the worst,” Agatha said grimly. “Speaking of dogs, when are you next seeing the pack?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We haven’t arranged anything yet.”</p><p>“So not tonight?”</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Does that mean I get you all to myself?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “If you want, Ms Harkness.”</p><p>“Oh I very much wa-”</p><p>Agatha froze. Her gaze was fixed on something beyond Rio, her eyes wide and skin paled. Rio had never seen this look before.</p><p>A look of pure horror.</p><p>“Rio, get in the back.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I mean it. Right now!”</p><p>Rio did as she was told and rushed into the back of the coffee shop. She pressed her ear against the door.</p><p>“Agatha,” the strong voice of a woman passed through the wood. “I see I’ve finally found you.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was grave, one of fear and sadness and betrayal and resentment. One Rio instantly understood as the two words were uttered.</p><p>“Hello mother.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora Harkness was just as her daughter remembered. Small, old, and utterly terrifying.</p><p>Still, Agatha stared her down with all the strength she had.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” she questioned. “I told you I never wanted to see you again.”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha, but that was a very long time ago. Things change.”</p><p>“Not this,” Agatha said sternly. “I don’t want anything to do with you.”</p><p>“You can’t just erase me from your life, Agatha. I’m your mother.”</p><p>“You don’t get to call yourself that!”</p><p>“Just listen to what I have to say,” Evanora pressed. “I assure you that it is something you want to hear.”</p><p>Wanda walked over to stand beside her. “Is everything okay, Agatha?”</p><p>“Everything’s fine,” Agatha assured. “I just…can you give me five minutes?”</p><p>“Sure,” Wanda replied, watching Evanora closely. “Let me know if you need me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, before leaving Evanora to a vacant table. Once they were sat and settled, she cut straight to the point. “So what do you want?”</p><p>“To give you an opportunity,” Evanora answered. “To make up for past mistakes.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “The only mistake I made was not leaving you sooner.”</p><p>Evanora gave her a sceptical look. “Now Agatha, that isn’t true. You were born to be a hunter. I made sure that you were.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Evanora waved her off. “What I’m saying is that you can’t deny your instincts. This is who you are, Agatha. It’s about time you joined us again, and what better way than catching the one that got away”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“The wolf you let slip on your last hunt.” Evanora pulled a piece of paper from her pocket. “It took years, but we found her, and she’s right here in Westview.”</p><p>Agatha watched as her mother placed the paper down on the table before her, and when she saw it, her eyes widened.</p><p>Because of the paper was a photograph, and a familiar face stared back at her.</p><p>Olivia.</p><p>“She didn’t hide herself very well,” Evanora commented. “She’s a political expert. Once we found out who she was, it didn’t take us long to find her. And she’s right here in Westview.”</p><p>“So what? You’ve brought the full coven here to hunt one wolf?”</p><p>“No, I came alone.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because this kill isn’t theirs and it isn’t mine. It’s yours. It’s time to make up for the past and join your sisters once more.”</p><p>Agatha pushed the photograph back. “I have no interest in hunting again.”</p><p>“If you say so.” Evanora got to her feet, leaving the photograph on the table. “I’ll be staying in town for a few days. I’m sure once you’ve finished with your stubbornness, you’ll realize that it’s time to come home and rejoin the mission you were born to achieve.”</p><p>Agatha watched as her mother walked out of the door, waiting until she was out of sight before racing into the back and into Rio’s waiting arms.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio held her close.</p><p>Agatha breathed in that distinctive campfire apple smell, and it managed to soothe her enough to continue.</p><p>“Did you hear any of that?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Heightened senses, remember? It was Olivia in the photo, wasn’t it?”</p><p>“How did you…”</p><p>“I had a suspicion,” Rio admitted. “I’ll text her now and tell her to meet us at the Firewatch tower.”</p><p>“We have to make sure we’re not followed,” Agatha insisted. “My mother knows every trick in the book.”</p><p>“We’ll be fine,” Rio assured, pulling her in her arms once more. “Together we’ll work it out. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha sank into the embrace. As long as they were together, they’d be fine. As long as they had each other, everything would work out.</p><p> </p><p>Olivia and Alice were already waiting for her when they arrived at the tower, both looking completely bewildered by the sudden summoning.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Alice asked as they approached. “Why the urgent meeting?”</p><p>“We need to go up,” Rio told them. “It’s safer up there.”</p><p>“Safer from what?” Olivia questioned. “Rio, what’s going on?”</p><p>“I’ll tell you when we’re up there. Trust me on this, okay?”</p><p>Olivia and Alice climbed the tower with ease, while Rio followed behind with Agatha on her back. She could feel her girlfriend’s hold tighten the higher they got, and by the time they reached the last set of steps, her thighs were squeezing her his so tight, she was sure they would bruise.</p><p>“How the hell is this place even taller than it looks?” Agatha questioned. “Are you sure this place will hold all of us up?”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio assured. “These things were built to last.”</p><p>Agatha refused to be put down until they were in cabin but seemed to relax when she was safely inside. Rio, however, felt worse.</p><p>“Well?” Olivia questioned, as she and Alice sat on the bed, staring at the pair expectantly. “What’s happened?”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who gave her an encouraging nod. Sucking in a deep breath, she decided to just rip the band aid off.</p><p>“Olivia, you’re in serious danger.”</p><p>“I am?” she frowned. “Why? What’s happened?”</p><p>“It’s complicated,” Rio admitted. “And I’m sorry, but you’ve been tracked by a dangerous witch, and she isn’t going to stop until you’re dead.”</p><p>“What witch?” Olivia questioned. “I haven’t done anything to any witch! I keep a low profile, I pay my taxes. How the fuck have they found out about me?”</p><p>“She already knew you were a wolf,” Agatha cut in. “She wasn’t hunting your wolf, she was hunting you.”</p><p>“And how do <em>you</em> know all this?” Olivia demanded. “How do either of you know about any of this?”</p><p>“Because the witch is my mother,” Agatha admitted. “And she wants me to kill you.”</p><p>That seemed to shut Olivia up.</p><p>“Your mother?” Alice questioned. “Evanora Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She tracked Olivia here and approached me to…to undo a past mistake. She wants me to kill Olivia to earn back my place in the coven, which of course I won’t do. Then she’ll take the matter into her own hands, and if she’s even a fraction as powerful as I remember, we don’t stand a chance.”</p><p>There was a loud thud outside the door, and they all jumped to attention.</p><p>“She’s here!” Alice gasped. “Did she track us?”</p><p>Rio waved her hand to summon her claws and braced herself as the door swung open. The moment she saw who it was, her body relaxed.</p><p>“Wanda!” Agatha huffed. “You scared the shit out of us!”</p><p>“Sorry.” Wanda kicked the door shut behind her. “I didn’t want to miss the party.”</p><p>Agatha still wasn’t amused. “What about the coffee shop?”</p><p>“Lilia and Billy are holding the fort. Don’t worry, your mother is still in town. Lilia is using her sight to track her.”</p><p>“I still don’t understand why your mother wants me,” Olivia</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who cleared her throat. “Olivia, I…we’ve met before.”</p><p>Olivia frowned. “We have?”</p><p>“Well, not face to face, but I’ve seen you before. It was…it was my coven that attacked your pack.”</p><p>A silence filled the room so thick that Rio feared she would suffocate. It wasn’t much of a surprise to her. When she heard both of their stories, she suspected there was an intersection, but hearing it aloud was another matter entirely.</p><p>Olivia slowly got to her feet. “Y-you killed my pack?”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Agatha admitted. “By that time, I was more interested in draining witches of their power.”</p><p>“But you were there?” Olivia questioned. “You watched my pack die and did nothing?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said without hesitation. “And I watched you hold one of your pack. I watched you cry, and I watched you run and I did nothing. I should have killed you, but I didn’t. I couldn’t.</p><p>Olivia blinked in surprise. “You let me go?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “And since then, my mother has seen you as the wolf that got away. Now she’s found you, she won’t rest until your dead. Either at my hand or hers.”</p><p>Olivia’s jaw tightened, and Rio was ready to jump in. To protect Agatha from Olivia’s justified anger, yet instead she watched as Olivia moved to the window facing West.</p><p>“If your mother is who I think she is, I want to kill her myself.”</p><p>“Usually I’d say go ahead,” Agatha admitted. “But I’m not risking any of lives over this. Including yours.”</p><p>“Mine doesn’t matter,” Olivia insisted as she moved for the door. “I need to find her. I have to…”</p><p>“Hey, hey.” Wanda put a hand on her arm, and Olivia instantly stopped. “You do matter, and we’ll work this out together.”</p><p>Olivia pulled her arm away but seemed to have calmed enough not to bolt. “So what? We just hide?”</p><p>“<em>You </em>need to hide,” Rio told her. “Here, where she can’t find you. Agatha and Wanda will put wards up so she can’t you, and Alice and I will take shifts in staying here to protect you. Perhaps if the trail runs cold, Evanora will move on.”</p><p>“And if she doesn’t?” Alice questioned, and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“We’ll either smuggle Olivia somewhere else, or we face her and fight.”</p><p>Olivia moved back to the window. “I vote for the latter.”</p><p>Rio and Alice exchanged worried glances.</p><p>This was certainly going to be interesting.</p><p> </p><p>That night, Olivia insisted she needed to let her wolf loose, so Alice and Wanda had gone to supervise, ensuring she didn’t make a b-line for town in search of a certain witch. Agatha and Rio stayed at the tower, putting the finishing touches to the wards.</p><p>“How does it look?” Rio asked, gripping Agatha’s thighs as she watched her paint the runes across the roof. They’d been like that for a few hours; Agatha sat on Rio’s shoulders as she drew marks across the ceiling in black sharpie, taking her time to ensure the rune was strong enough to hold.</p><p>“Just about…done.”</p><p>The moment the runes were complete, purple magic spread across the beams. The ward was in place, and for a moment, they could relax.</p><p>Agatha capped the pen and slowly slid down Rio’s back, landing softly on the mattress of the cabins small bed.</p><p>“Well, I’m glad that’s done. My mother will have a hard time getting through that.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said as she moved to look of one of the surrounding windows. “Hopefully we won’t need it.”</p><p>“Hopefully not,” Agatha agreed, before tilting her head. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio assured. “Just a little stressed.”</p><p>Agatha got up and walked towards her. “So you’re staring lovingly at the moon?”</p><p>Rio looked back at her with a guilty smile. “It’s that obvious?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Is it your wolf?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “It’s restless. I think it’s being out here. It’s expecting to be let loose.”</p><p>Agatha considered her girlfriend’s words, surprised by the rush that ran through her. It was then she decided to throw caution to the wind. What was the worst that could happen?</p><p>“Do it.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “What?”</p><p>“Let go,” Agatha encouraged. “Even if it’s just a little bit.”</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t,” Rio insisted. “I don’t know how my wolf will act around you.”</p><p>“Probably like you do,” Agatha argued. “Showering me in sloppy kisses and fucking me six ways to Sunday.”</p><p>“But what if it’s not like that,” Rio argued, before glancing to her crotch. “What if I end up with a, you know”.</p><p>“Then we’ll deal with it.” Agatha stepped closer. “I want this, Rio. Just let go.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Shh.” Agatha leaned up, their lips inches apart. “Don’t think. Just do.”</p><p>She watched as the resolve left Rio’s eyes, before her pupils blew impossibly large. Then Rio’s mouth was on hers, desperate and hot, and then all bets were off.</p><p>The next thing Agatha knew, she was laid naked on the bed, Rio’s mouth exploring her chest with hungry licks and kisses.</p><p>“Fuck!” she gasped as those frantic lips latched on to her breast one more, practically devouring it while. “Babe, you’re driving me crazy.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio growled. “I need you.”</p><p>“Then have me.” Agatha reached down and cupped her girlfriend’s crotch, smiling when she found what she hoped would be there.</p><p>“You’re so hard for me. I can feel it.”</p><p>Rio growled and kicked her legs hard enough for her pants to roll to her knees, leaving a pair of tented boxers in her wake.</p><p>Agatha smiled and reached down once more, reaching in to pull the hardness free. The shaft felt warm in her hand, and Agatha couldn’t help but moan. She wanted it inside her more than anything.</p><p>It seemed Rio had the same idea. She settled herself between her open thighs, and with a single cautious glance as warning, she pressed into her.</p><p>Agatha moaned. Rio was big, bigger than any strap she’d taken, and she couldn’t get enough.</p><p>The times Rio had strapped her, she had waited once fully inside, waiting until Agatha was practically begging before she started to move. Wolf Rio, however, didn’t even give her a moment. She was thrusting into her at a rapid space, the bed banging against the wall over and over, making the windows rattle.</p><p>Agatha didn’t care. All she cared about was the way Rio was pounding into her, and she hoped she’d never ever stop,</p><p>“Oh fuck!” Agatha cried. “Rio, you feel so good.”</p><p>“Gonna breed you so good,” Rio mumbled into her ear as her thrust got impossibly harder. “Gonna give you so much seed.”</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha’s nails dug into her back. “Please, come inside me! Please, please, Rio! I need it so bad!”</p><p>Rio’s thrusts became more frantic, her pubic mound rubbing deliciously against her clit. A few more thrusts and Agatha was falling apart, her walls spasming around the thick shaft inside her.</p><p>Rio fucked her through it, until, after two jabbing thrusts, she pushed in deep. Agatha felt the warmth of her spend pool inside her before a sharp pain ripped through her shoulder. Rio’s teeth sank into her skin, and her body was overrun by pleasure once again.</p><p>When they came down, Rio unlatched from her shoulder and nuzzled into her, her added appendage still stiff within her. Agatha held her close, basking in that delicious campfire apple smell once more.</p><p>The bite on her shoulder stung, and she would need Wanda’s help with a healing spell in the morning, but in that moment, she didn’t care. She had her Rio in her arms, and that’s all she’d ever need.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha left with Wanda and Alice at sunrise. The witches had a coffee shop to run, and Jen was working back-to-back night shifts, so Alice wanted to make her dinner (or was it breakfast?) when she got home. To explain everything to her, and hope she was understanding.</p><p>That left Rio to stay with Olivia at the top of the tour. The day passed slowly, Olivia spending most of the evening sleeping, after apparently spending most of the night before chasing Wanda through the forest with Alice hot on her heels.</p><p>When she woke up, they shared a bag of Cheetos, before breaking open a pack of cards Rio had found under the bed.</p><p>They were in the middle of their twentieth game of Trash when Alice returned with a bag filled with groceries. “I brought dinner.”</p><p>Olivia snatched the bag and began to rummage. “Thank fuck. I thought I’d have to go hunting.”</p><p>Alice shook her head, before looking at the cards. “Who’s winning.”</p><p>“Me,” Rio said proudly. “For the fifth time in a row.”</p><p>“She keeps getting the fucking tens I want,” Olivia complained. “This game is so rigged.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Well, you better wrap this up because Agatha has already messaged me twice reminding me to swap with Rio, and I’m not getting the brunt of that anger if her girlfriend isn’t presented to her pronto.”</p><p>Rio threw down her cards. “Okay then, I’m out.”</p><p>“What, just like that?” Olivia questioned. “Your girlfriend claps her hands and you go running?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Simp.”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Oh enough,” Alice huffed. “You can’t blame Rio for wanting to get back. She’s been up here eating Cheetos with you all day and she has her girlfriend and a batch of homemade cinnamon rolls waiting for her in Westview.”</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes. “You’re going to turn into a cinnamon roll if you don’t curb it.”</p><p>“They’re delicious!”</p><p>“You’re always eating them,” Olivia complained. “I swear, every time I go in the Witch’s Brew, you’re there eating one.”</p><p>Rio held her hands up. “Hey, I can’t help it. As soon as I walk in, its all I can smell. Like its seeped in the walls or something.”</p><p>The pair stared at her in bewilderment.</p><p>“What?” she questioned.</p><p>Alice and Olivia exchanges before the latter spoke up.</p><p>“Rio, the Witch’s Brew doesn’t smell like cinnamon.”</p><p>“Yes, it does,” she said, shaking her head at Olivia’s nonsense. “Stop playing.”</p><p>“I’m not!” Olivia insisted. “Alice, back me up.”</p><p>“Olivia’s right,” Alice replied. “It smells like coffee.”</p><p>“Well duh, but cinnamon too.”</p><p>Both wolves looked to each other and shook their heads. Rio put her hands on her hips. “Then why does Agatha smell like cinnamon all the time?”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “Oh.”</p><p>Olivia smirked. “I should have known.”</p><p>“What?” Rio looked between them. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Rio, Agatha doesn’t smell like cinnamon to us,” Alice explained. “The same way Jen doesn’t smell like cherry blossom to you. You’re scenting her. She’s your mate.”</p><p>Suddenly, it all made sense, and Rio kicked herself for not realizing sooner. Of course Agatha was her mate. How could it ever be anything else?</p><p>“Oh my God.”</p><p>“You need to go.” Olivia shoved her towards the door. “You need to tell her!”</p><p>“What? Now?”</p><p>“Yes now,” she insisted. “Don’t waste a moment.”</p><p>Rio nodded and moved to the door. “I’ll be back as soon as I can. Stay safe.”</p><p>“We will,” Alice promised. “Now go get your girl.”</p><p>Rio drove back to town as fast as she could. It was drawing dark, but the people of Westview were out in force. Dressed in costumes and walking through the streets with trick or treat buckets while admiring the imaginative decorations covering the lawns.</p><p>It was then Rio remembered what day it was. October 31<sup>st</sup>. Halloween.</p><p>She managed to get in her usual parking spot outside her shop. She’d been closed all day, and she already dreaded to think of what mess waited for her inside. That was a problem for another day, though. She had something much more important to take care of.</p><p>Rio ran across to the Witch’s Brew, only to find it dark and empty. She checked her watch and frowned. It wasn’t even six yet. Why were they already closed?</p><p>“Agatha?” She knocked on the glass. “Wanda?”</p><p>She saw nothing, just the shadows of the tables and chairs and the low glow of the security lights. Still, something was off. The tables were still set, and Rio could make out dishes still on some of the tables. Agatha and Wanda never left the place in a mess, always taking the time to clean and sweep the whole place before locking up.</p><p>Taking the chance, she pushed on the door, surprised to find it open.</p><p>“Agatha?” she called out as she stepped inside. “Wanda?”</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Maybe they were dealing with something in the back, she wondered as she walked towards the counter. Perhaps something had happened with the inventory, or Lilia and Billy had messed something up yesterday.</p><p>Yet as she got closer to the door, she spotted something on the ground beside the counter.</p><p>She squinted in the darkness to see what it was, and her heart dropped.</p><p>It was a foot.</p><p>Poking out from behind the counter, limb against the vinal flooring.</p><p>Rio rushed over, hoping her suspicions were wrong. Yet when she looked behind the counter, her worse fears were confirmed.</p><p>Agatha and Wanda. Both unconscious. Sprawled on the ground behind the counter.</p><p>Rio quickly dropped to her knees, her heart racing as she went to check Agatha’s own pulse. The beats were steady and she seemed to be breathing, but she was totally out cold.</p><p>Before Rio could question what happened, she heard a noise behind her. Shirling round, she looked to the figure that now towered over her.</p><p>“Well, well, well.” Evanora smirked. “The wolf has fallen right into my trap.”</p>

<p>“What the fuck did you do?” Rio demanded as she jumped to her feet, claws springing free from her fingertips.</p><p>“Relax, wolf,” Evanora sneered. “I don’t waste witchblood. Your mate and her little friend will be just fine.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “How did you work it out?”</p><p>“That you were a wolf?” Evanora questioned. “Please, do you really think I don’t keep tabs on my daughter? You may have been well hidden from humans, but there are many eyes in the forest. Ones that will happily spy for me. Your little friend was just the bait. Now when I’m done with you, I can kill the rest of your little pack. And don’t worry about Agatha. I’ll make sure she’s taken care of.”</p><p>Rio stood her ground. “I’ll die before I let you take her.”</p><p>“Good.” Evanora grinned wickedly. “That was always the plan.”</p><p>Rio bared her teeth and charged forward, only for a great force to throw her across the room, hitting a group of thanked with a harsh clatter.</p><p>“Silly wolf. Do you really think you can get the best of me?”</p><p>Rio pulled herself to her feet, facing Evanora once more. “I won’t let you hurt her again.”</p><p>“The only one who’s hurt her here is you, wolf,” Evanora snapped. “You have no idea what you’ve done.”</p><p>“I’d never hurt her,” Rio insisted. “I love her.”</p><p>“So you did what all wolves do,” Evanora spat. “Bite and claim.”</p><p>Rio frowned at the witch’s words, only to jump to the side as a shot of magic flew towards her. It hit the wall, leaving an angry scorch mark in its place.</p><p>“Accept your fate, wolf,” Evanora spat. “I won’t rest until you’re dead.”</p><p>Rio growled and dived forward, catching Evanora’s face with her claws. The witch cried out before blasting her back. Once more, Rio was on the ground, watching as the now bloodied figure walked towards her.</p><p>“I’m going to enjoy every moment of this. I’m going to make this hurt so much you’ll be begging me to stop. And I’ll make sure Agatha knows just how cowardly you truly are.”</p><p>Something snapped within her, and Rio felt herself sink back. Her bones snapped and</p><p>No, not just her wolf.</p><p>She became the alpha.</p><p>Evanora cackled. “There it is. Your true self.”</p><p>Rio heard herself growl. Her wolf wanted blood, and she couldn’t stop it.</p><p>She lunged forward, ready to rip out the witch’s throat, but Evanora was quicker. Her body hit the ground with a thumb as an invisible force pushed upon her, crushing her against its weight.</p><p>“Too easy,” Evanora taunted. “Whatever did my daughter see in you.”</p><p>The pain was unbearable, and in that moment, Rio was sure she would die.</p><p>Until something shifted in the air, that cinnamon smell becoming stronger.</p><p>“Mother,” a firm voice cut through the darkness. “Stop.”</p><p>Rio’s wolf howled. Her Agatha. Her mate.</p><p>Agatha stood by the counter, purple magic gathering in her palms. She had never looked so beautiful. So powerful.</p><p>“Oh look who it is,” Evanora sneered. “My traitorous daughter.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her, her gaze instead drifting to Rio. “Run! I’ll catch up with you!”</p><p>Rio’s wolf hesitated. How could she leave her in danger?</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Agatha promised. “Please, Rio. Go!”</p><p>Her mate’s command vibrated through her bones, and so Rio took off. Her wolf jumped through the window and darted out onto the street.</p><p>Around her she heard screaming, screeching breaks and frantic car horns. Rio paid no mind to it. She just ran. Towards the forest. Towards her pack. To ready them for a fight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Rio go, relieved her love would be okay for now. She’d catch up with her soon, but for now she had to deal with her mother.</p><p>Evanora laughed. “Of all the wolves you could have chosen, you went for an alpha pup.”</p><p>“Just leave, mother,” Agatha demanded. “Let me live my life. Let me be happy.”</p><p>“Your happiness is none of my concern,” Evanora spat. “It never has been.”</p><p>“Oh, I know. You never cared about me. Only what I could do for you.”</p><p>“That’s what I made you for, you foolish girl! Do you think you were conceived with love?”</p><p>Agatha had never thought that. Not for a second.</p><p>“You got knocked up so you could make your daughter into a killer? You’re just sick!”</p><p>“You were a killer the moment you took root within me. You were a risk, one that I believed would create the ultimate hunter, but I was wrong. I should have known. You were born evil. I should have killed you the moment you left my body.”</p><p>“You made me evil. Your actions and nothing else!” Agatha sent a blast of magic towards her, but her mother deflected it with ease.</p><p>“You still don’t get it, do you?” Evanora laughed. “Foolish girl. I’d have thought by now you would realize, what with that stubborn bite on your shoulder.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand reached up to ghost the mark Rio left on her in the throes of passion. The mark that had now been healed, yet even Wanda’s magic couldn’t erase the scars it left behind.</p><p>“You’re a smart girl,” Evanora reminded her. “Why would the bite remain?”</p><p>Agatha’s mind raced through every possible scenario but found herself left with only one.</p><p>“No.” She shook her head. “I can’t be! I’m a witchblood!”</p><p>“Yes, you got that from me. But your father, dear daughter, was a wolfblood. I created you to become the ultimate killer, but instead you became an abomination.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart began to race.</p><p>She was a wolfblood.</p><p>But how could this be? She had been around wolves all her life. How had she never been triggered? Never been bitten? Never changed?</p><p>Evanora cackled. “You still don’t understand, do you? Naive girl. I was lacing wolfsbane in your drink since you were a babe. I would never allow you to actually change, but the wolfblood made you stronger. Made you a better hunter. Who knows what you would have been if you hadn’t left? My hope was that you’d stay in the city. Wolves don’t last long there. Not enough space for them to run a mock. But no, you had to move here. You had to meet a wolf, and you had to get yourself bitten. The change has probably already started. Who knows what you’ll become now? But don’t worry, dear daughter. I won’t hurt you yet. Not when I suspect you have my grandchild resting in your belly.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand rested over her stomach. “That’s not possible.”</p><p>“Oh it is,” Evanora insisted. “That bite is a mating bite. When alphas spill their seed, they can’t help but staking their claim. I suspect the little one will be rooted by now, and with a little help, we can move it along quicker. But don’t you worry, dear daughter. I won’t make the same mistakes I did with you. Your child will be a fine wolfkiller.”</p><p>Rage filled Agatha as threw blast after blast of magic, but Evanora just batted them away once more.</p><p>“Silly girl. I’d say it was pathetic, but I know your little trick. I always knew. I let it continue as it made you stronger, but I will not let you steal power from me.” Evanora pulled a blade from her sleeve. “I’ll fight you the old-fashioned way. As long as your heart is beating, the baby will be fine. With the rest of you, I’ll do my worst.”</p><p>Before Agatha could react, a shot of red flew through the air, hitting Evanora square in the chest. She fell to the ground, the knife sliding across the ground.</p><p>“Come on.” Wanda took her hand. “We need to go.”</p><p>Agatha took one glance back at her mother’s unconscious form, before running with Wanda out of the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s wolf ran to the edge of town, along the road connecting Eastview to Westview. Towards the gap in the trees she had escaped from the fateful night, wanting to return to the forest her wolf called home.</p><p>She needed to get to her pack. To return to face Evanora together and save her mate from the witch’s grasp.</p><p>And she was almost there. Almost off the road, almost safe. Until she turned the bend and was forced to skid to a stop.</p><p>A sheriff’s car was parked straight across the road. Deputy Bohner stood behind it, shotgun raised.</p><p>He grinned victoriously. “Now I’ve got you.”</p><p>Rio’s wolf panicked and raced for the treeline. She heard the boom of the shotgun, followed by the explosion of wood as the bullet hit a tree, missing her head by mere inches. Bark flew around her, but she kept on running. Faster and faster. Deeper and deeper.</p><p>She could sense the deputy chasing after her, could hear him calling, could hear gunshots behind her. Still, she kept going. She just needed to get further away, get deeper into the forest. She’d lose him eventually. Humans didn’t have the stamina to cover miles, no matter how determined they were.</p><p>After a while, Rio was confident she’d gotten away, that she could concentrate on the real danger. Until her foot caught on an exposed root and she hit the ground with a thud.</p><p>She growled and tugged to pull her foot free, before scrambling back to her feet. She took a breath, readied herself to run again.</p><p>A twig cracked.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>A sharp click came from behind her.</p><p>She dared look back.</p><p>Deputy Bohner stood strong, the shot gun held high. He aimed it straight at her.</p><p>“Gotcha.”</p><p>Rio’s blood ran cold. This was it. She was going to die here. She wasn’t going to save Agatha. She wasn’t going to save Agatha, or Wanda, or Olivia, probably not even Alice. Her story ended there, not in an epic battle defending the people she loved, but looking down the barrel of a gun, wielded by a misogynistic pig.</p><p>What happened next was almost two fast for her to register. A sense of something approaching, a familiar blur of black and orange, Deputy Bohner knocked off his feet.</p><p>A bang.</p><p>A cry.</p><p>Deputy Bohner scrambled to his feet. “No, no, no.”</p><p>Rio’s wolf looked down and whined.</p><p>Alice lay on the ground, clutching her shoulder, blood tricking through her fingers.</p><p>“No, no, no.” Deputy Bohner went to run, but he was quickly tackled to the ground. Olivia was in full wolf form, pinning him to the ground with snarling teeth.</p><p>“Olivia!” Alice called out through her pain. “Olivia, you have to let him go!”</p><p>Olivia huffed and climbed off him, watching as he ran away off, before transforming to her human form. “Fucking bastard!”</p><p>Rio’s wolf slipped away, and she quickly ran to Alice’s side. “Alice, why did you do that?”</p><p>“Had to save you,” she said through gritted teeth. “This…it’s all my fault…couldn’t let you die.”</p><p>“So you let yourself die instead?” Olivia questioned as she helped apply pressure to the wound. “We need to get you to a hospital.”</p><p>“Jen,” Alice gasped. “Please, I need Jen.”</p><p>Olivia looked to Rio. “You need to take her. I’ll just put her in danger.”</p><p>“I think it’s the other way round now,” Rio said gravely. “I went back and found Agatha and Wanda unconscious. Evanora used them as bait. She never wanted you. She knew about me and Agatha somehow, and this was her way of getting me out of the way so she could force Agatha back to the coven.”</p><p>Olivia’s eyes widened. “A-are they okay? Is Wanda okay?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted. “I tried to fight Evanora, but she was too strong. Agatha came to and used her magic to give me the chance to run. I was trying to reach you guys.”</p><p>Alice tried to sit up. “You need to…you need to go back.”</p><p>“What we need is to get you out of here,” Rio insisted, before looking to Olivia. “You need to take her.”</p><p>“But what about-”</p><p>“Olivia, please just do what I-”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio looked round and saw a red light approaching them. When it got closer, she realized what it was. Who it was. She smiled with pure relief. There, floating down through the trees, was Wanda and Agatha.</p><p>The moment their feet hit the ground, they quickly ran over.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Wanda gasped. “What happened?”</p><p>“Fucking cop shot her,” Olivia huffed. “We need to get her some help.”</p><p>“You guys take her,” Rio insisted. “Evanora won’t chase you. She wants me.”</p><p>“And me.” Agatha placed a hand on her shoulder. “And I’m not leaving you.”</p><p>“Right, then we need to move.” Wanda looked to Olivia. “Can you carry her?”</p><p>“I can’t go to the hospital naked,” Olivia argued. “And Rio has no clothes on either.”</p><p>Wanda sighed and waved her hand, and soon the two wolves were clothed.</p><p>“You need to go,” Rio insisted. “And when she’s safe, Olivia, you need to run. Get as far away from here as you can.”</p><p>Olivia stole a glance at Wanda before nodding, then scooped Alice into her arms with ease.</p><p>“Good luck,” she said as Wanda placed a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Rio watched as they were envelopes in red magic, before floating up through the trees. It seemed Wanda was more than your standard witch.</p><p>She then looked to her mate. “Come on. We need to keep moving.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed Rio through the trees, her mind trying to comprehend all that had happened. The attack, Rio, Alice. It was all too much. Selfishly, however, her mind had fixed on something else. Her mother’s words echoed in her head. The revelation of what she truly was.</p><p>“We’re nearly there,” Rio promised. “If it was light, we’d be able to see the tower through the trees.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. She needed to just say it. “Rio, we need to talk.”</p><p>Rio laughed nervously. “You’re not breaking up with me before I fight your mom are you? Because that would be really fucking awkward.”</p><p>“No, no,” she quickly assured. “But you need to know something. Something my mother said.”</p><p>Rio took her hand. “Let’s get to the tower. We can talk properly there.”</p><p>Once they made it to the top of the tower, Agatha tried to relax. Her wards and Wanda’s chaos magic would clean up their tracks, and make the tower appear totally empty, even with the cabin illuminated by the camping lantern Olivia and Alice must have left on before they ran to Rio’s aid.</p><p>Rio sat on the bed, patting the space next to her. “No one’s close. We can talk for a while.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and sat down beside her. She reached out and took Rio’s hand, mostly for her own comfort. “This will be a lot. I know because it’s a lot for me. But you need to know.”</p><p>“You can tell me anything,” Rio insisted. “No matter what.”</p><p>“My mother said things after you left. She told me things I never knew about myself, and it’s changed everything.”</p><p>“What things?” Rio shuffled closer. “Whatever it is, we’ll get through it, Agatha. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. “Rio, I’m a wolf.”</p><p>She watched her lover’s eyes widen. “What?”</p><p>“My mother wanted to make the ultimate wolf killer, so got herself knocked up by a wolfblood. That makes me half witch, half wolf.”</p><p>“Holy shit.” Rio stared at her in disbelief. “How is that even possible? Like, you’ve never turned, have you?”</p><p>“My mother took precautions when I was in the coven.”</p><p>“Wolfsbane?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “When I left, I do remember feeling different. Restless. I guess that’s why I was always able to handle running my coffee shops. I didn’t get fatigued working long shifts, and I always needed to have a new project on the go. In the city, there aren’t many wolves, so I had nothing to trigger my wolf, but then I moved here and met you. I guess that’s why we were so drawn to each other. Our wolves could see each other when we couldn’t. Then last night you bit me, and now my wolf is clawing its way out.”</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Rio covered her face with her hand. “Fuck, Agatha. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“You don’t need to be sorry,” Agatha insisted. “I would have transformed at some point, but at least we know what triggered your wolf now too.”</p><p>“Do you feel hungry?” Rio questioned. “No pains? No fatigue?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Maybe it’ll be different for me. My wolf is also a witch, after all. Who knows what I’ll become, but that’s not our biggest concern right now.”</p><p>“It seems pretty concerning to me,” Rio argued, but Agatha ignored her.</p><p>“My mother recognised the bite. She said it’s called a mating bite. She knows what we did last night and now…now she suspects that I…I might be pregnant.”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned. “H-how could she possibly…even if it was possible, it’s too early to tell, right?”</p><p>“Yes, but she believes I might be, and that’s enough for her. She wants the baby for herself.”</p><p>“Well, she can’t fucking have them,” Rio wrapped a protective arm around her. “How is she so sure?”</p><p>“You’re an alpha,” Agatha reminded her. “You’re practically a baby machine.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up. “I am?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “And you certainly didn’t hold back last night.”</p><p>A deep blush crossed Rio’s cheeks, and she quickly cleared her throat. “Agatha, I need to tell you something too. Something that was so obvious that I can’t believe it took me so long to realise it. And now it makes even more sense.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Rio reached up to cup her cheek. “You know how I always say you smell like cinnamon? Well, there’s a reason why, Agatha. I can scent you, and I think you can scent me too.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. She knew what scenting was, but that would mean…</p><p>“We’re mates?”</p><p>Rio grinned and nodded. “Yes, my love. We were always destined to find each other, and there’s no way I’m letting you go. Not you, and not our baby.”</p><p>“Rio, we don’t even know if…”</p><p>“I know, but I still promise you, Agatha. That woman will never take you again. I swear you’ll…you’ll both be safe.”</p><p>Tears pricked Agatha’s eyes. “I love you, Rio.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Rio replied without hesitation, and pulled her into a passionate kiss.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back, tears trailing down her cheeks. Her Rio. Her mate. Her family. She wished to whatever god would listen that they’d somehow have more time. She never wanted to let this go, in life or in death.</p><p>Then every hair on her body stood on end.</p><p>Rio bolted up, looking out of every window frantically. “Somethings coming.”</p><p>Agatha got to her feet, grasping hold of Rio’s hand. She could feel it then. The presence. The magic.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” a familiar voice boomed from below. “You have something that belongs to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s wolf growled. Evanora had found them, but this time she wasn’t backing down.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha squeezed her hand. “We’re safe.”</p><p>“What if she gets up here?”             </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Agatha assured. “I planned for this.”</p><p>Rio waited, listening closely. She could hear movement below, not on the structure, but on the ground. Hear mutterings of incantations, until suddenly, the presence seemed to rise.</p><p>Evanora Harkness floated into view, now dressed in a long black cloak. She landed on the deck and pushed open the door with ease. Stepping into the cabin, she looked at them both with a wicked smirk.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t my daughter and her little pet. Abandoned by your pack, I see? I must say your little friend is very powerful, Agatha. Perhaps I need to recruit her when I’m done with you both.”</p><p>Rio moved to stand in front of Agatha. “You’re not taking them.”</p><p>Evanora laughed. “So Agatha told you? I wouldn’t get too attached, wolf. The child is barely a speck, and you’ll be dead before it even gains a heartbeat.”</p><p>Rio was ready to run forward, to rip the witch limb from limb, but before she could, Agatha pulled her back. She watched as her mate took her place, purple magic summoned to her palms.</p><p>She readied herself for a firefight. For a frenzy of magic. For an epic battle between mother and daughter.</p><p>Instead, Agatha just blasted the door shut.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio questioned while Evanora cackled once more.</p><p>“Stupid girl. I’ll make quick work of you wolf, then I’ll take my time with you.”</p><p>Rio watched as Evanora raised her arms, ready to unleash her magic. Yet Agatha stood there, a smug smile on her face.</p><p>With a wicked grin, Evanora threw her hands forward. To inflict Rio with that infamous killing blow…</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Evanora looked at her hands. “What…”</p><p>“Look up, mother.”</p><p>Rio followed Evanora’s gaze and grinned. Her mate was a genius.</p><p>“What did you do?” Evanora demanded. “Tell me, child!”</p><p>“In a given space, only the witch who cast the runes can use her magic.” Agatha smirked devilishly. “I did a lot of readings when I left you, mother.”</p><p>“This is Darkhold magic,” Evanora accused. “How can someone like you master such power?”</p><p>“You made me strong,” Agatha reminded her. “It seems your ambition has betrayed you.”</p><p>“I don’t need my magic to fight,” Evanora sneered as she pulled a knife from her belt. “Now you’re going to…”</p><p>Agatha flicked her hand, sending Evanora flying out of the window. Somehow, she managed to grip onto the deck railing, stopping herself from falling. Rio watched as she pulled herself up, an evil sneer on her face.</p><p>“If I can’t fight you in there, I’ll fight you out here.”</p><p>Magic pulled Rio forward, through the broken window and onto the deck.  She fell close to the steps leading down the tower, and she thought for a moment. Perhaps she could run. Perhaps she could lead Evanora away. It would give Agatha enough time. Time to get away. To find Wanda. To be safe.</p><p>Before she had change to consider it, Evanora used her magic to pull her up and levitate her forward. “Let me make this quick, wolf. I have more important matters to attend to.”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha ran forward, but Evanora sent a blast through the window, hitting Agatha in the chest. She was down in an instant.</p><p>“Agatha?!” Rio tried to move, tried to escape Evanora’s vice grip. But it was hopeless.</p><p>Evanora had won, and there was nothing she could do. Her wolf howled within her, a soothing howl. One of acceptance. It had been the fate of so many wolves. All she could hope was that her mate would escape and her child, if they indeed existed, would know warmth and love.</p><p>“I’m going to enjoy this,” Evanora said in cruel delight. “Out of all the wolfblood I’ve spilt, yours will certainly be the most satisfying.”</p><p>Rio braced herself for the blow, prepared for the pain, and whatever it was that came next.</p><p>Instead, she heard a howl.</p><p>Rio dropped to the ground and had barely enough time to look round before a wolf jumped out onto the deck. She recognised them instantly.</p><p>Olivia.</p><p>The fearless wolf ran forward, jumping over Rio and colliding into Evanora’s body.</p><p>They both flew back, toppling over the railing, before falling out of sight.</p><p>“Olivia!” Rio called out as a bloodcurdling scream echoed through the air, followed by a heavy thud.</p><p>Rio’s entire body went numb. She struggled to get to her feet, running to the railing.</p><p>There, at the bottom of the tower, lay the body of Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Yet it was alone. No wolf or human form laid with her. Rio looked around frantically. “Olivia?”</p><p>“Over here!”</p><p>Rio looked to one of the trees and spotted Olivia dangling from one of the tree branches. Totally naked and totally alive.</p><p>Rio laughed as relief washed over her. They’d done it. Evanora was gone. Her family was safe.</p><p>“Rio?” her mate called from the cabin, and she quickly rushed inside. Agatha was sat up, clutching her head.</p><p>Rio quickly knelt beside her. “My love, are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha assured. “My mother?”</p><p>“Dead. Olivia killed her. We’re safe, my love,” Rio promised as she pulled her mate into her arms. “Nothing can hurt us now.”</p><p> </p><p>The bullet had been a threw and threw, and after a few days in hospital at Jen’s insistence, Alice was finally coming home.</p><p>So of course they had to throw a party.</p><p>The Witch’s Brew was decorated with balloons, banners and lights, trying to cover up the scorch marks and boarded-up window. Agatha and Wanda had been working to get it fixed up, and Rio had cleared some of the flower shop so they could sell some pastries. They hoped the coffee shop would be back better than ever soon, but for now they were taking every day as it came.</p><p>The town had been a little shaken since the ‘wolf attack’, but it had thankfully been quickly overshadowed by the arrest of the Eastview deputy who shot an unarmed woman in the woods. It seemed nothing excited a small town more than attempted murder.</p><p>Rio, however, was just glad that Alice was okay, and so closed the flower shop early to help set up for her homecoming. Wanda had tasked her and Olivia to put up some string lights, which as it turned out was much harder than it looked.</p><p>“Hold it still,” Olivia complained. “I can’t stick it down when you’re wiggling it.”</p><p>“And I can’t hold it still with you pulling at it!”</p><p>“Enough children,” Agatha warned as she carried a tray of snacks out of the kitchen. “We’ve had enough fighting for one week.”</p><p>Rio grumbled and held the string of lights as still as she could so Olivia could tape it securely to the wall. “There we go.”</p><p>“Teamwork,” Olivia said with a grin. “Now we have to do it all over again.”</p><p>Rio groaned, but continued with the task, and soon the Witch’s Brew was as cosy and welcoming as ever.</p><p>Alice arrived with her arm in a sling and a huge smile on her face. Rio wanted to run over and hug her, but she didn’t want to make her accidentally pull her stitches (especially not with Jen stood behind her like a guard dog with a medical license), so instead greeted her with a high five.</p><p>“Glad to see you out of scrubs. Blue is not your colour.”</p><p>Alice laughed. “Me too, though I am mourning the loss of my jacket. The bullet hole did make it look edgy, but now it’s ‘police evidence’.”</p><p>“Well, we have a surprise for you.” Olivia waved for Alice to follow her to the counter, were Agatha and Wanda waited with anticipating smiles. A shopping bag sat on the counter in front of them, and Olivia quickly picked it up and held it open. “We got you something.”</p><p>Alice looked between them before reaching into the bag. She pulled out the garment and with Jen’s help, she held it up to see what it was. As soon as she realised what it was, she hugged it to her chest.</p><p>“How did you find the exact same one?”</p><p>“I have connections,” Agatha said with a shrug. “Rio and I drove out to Brooklyn to get it.”</p><p>“Holy shit! This is awesome.”</p><p>“But you can’t wear it yet,” Jen warned her. “You’re still recovering.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Alright, Kale. Stop being a party pooper.”</p><p>Olivia managed to persuade Jen to let Alice drape it over her shoulders, and they were trying to secure it when Lilia and Billy arrived.</p><p>“Sorry we’re late,” Lilia announced as the joined the party. “This one had detention.”</p><p>“Detention?” Agatha frowned. “For what?”</p><p>“Kissing boys under the bleachers,” Lilia answered, and Billy blushed as the room descended into laughter.</p><p>“Don’t worry, kid,” Olivia piped up. “When I was in boarding school, I…” Rio saw Wanda elbow her in the side. “…I did a lot of things you shouldn’t do. Get good grades, don’t do drugs. Oh, and wear a condom.”</p><p>Billy covered his ears. “Can we stop with this conversation now?”</p><p>Wanda patted him on the shoulder. “Come on. Let’s put some music on.”</p><p>Rio socialized for a while, joking with Olivia and Alice and chatting with Lilia and Billy, while getting told off by Jen and Wanda for encouraging Alice to dance around.</p><p>Then she spotted Agatha, stood away from everyone else, leaning against the counter. Like a moth to a flame, she made her way over, smiling brightly as she cupped her girlfriend’s hips. She kissed her sweetly. “You okay, my love?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’m great. Just restless.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. Agatha’s transformation had manifested differently from hers. While Rio’s body had changed, Agatha’s remained as it always had. What Rio hadn’t expected, however, was her mate’s insatiable…well, everything. She ate all the leftover Halloween candy in one sitting, she could run for miles and still complain when Rio wanted to head back, and her libido was unlike anything Rio had ever known. Her wolf was loving all of this, of course, and she wanted nothing more than to give in to all of Agatha’s wolfly whims.</p><p>“When the parties over, we’ll go run,” Rio promised, before smirking. “Or we could head home and wear our wolves down another way.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at that, before a seriousness crossed her face. “I stopped by the pharmacy today. I picked up some tests.”</p><p>Rio’s heart jolted as her wolf howled with joy. “Have you taken them yet?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “And I don’t want to just yet. It’s still too early, but I want to be prepared.”</p><p>Rio understood. “You know whatever happens…”</p><p>“Yes, I know. It’s my choice, blah, blah, blah.”</p><p>“It’s true,” Rio insisted. “I just want you to be happy.”</p><p>“I am happy,” Agatha assured. “I love you.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I love you too.”</p><p>They kissed once more, relishing in their combined scent, until they heard someone clear their throat. They pulled apart to see Olivia stood next to them.</p><p>“What?” Rio questioned, and Olivia held her hands up in mock defence.</p><p>“Sorry for wanting to escape Jen’s wrath for 5 minutes. That woman is seriously overprotective. Are we sure she’s not the wolf in that relationship?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Maybe we need to check if she can scent Alice.”</p><p>“Alice said Jen smells like cherry blossoms, so I think Alice must be similar,” Rio mused. “Since our scents complement each other.”</p><p>“Maybe peach blossom or jasmine?” Olivia mused. “Probably jasmine.”</p><p>“I think Lilia probably smells like invents,” Agatha noted. “And Billy smells like Hot Topic.”</p><p>“Is that a specific smell?” Rio questioned, only for Agatha and Olivia to confirm it in unison.</p><p>“What do you think Wanda smells like?” Agatha asked, and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Roses?”</p><p>Agatha wrinkled her nose. “Really, I was thinking fire.”</p><p>“Does fire have a smell?” Rio questioned and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Fine, smoke then.”</p><p>“Smoke?” Rio grimaced. “That’s not sexy.”</p><p>“Depends on what’s burning,” Agatha argued. “Like when you get certain woods, they burn differently on a fire. Some just smell like smoke, but others have a specific smell.”</p><p>“That’s oddly specific.”</p><p>“Like cinnamon isn’t?”</p><p>“Excuse me, miss campfire apples.”</p><p>“I can’t help how you smell.”</p><p>“And I can’t help how-”</p><p>“Strawberries.”</p><p>They both looked at Olivia, who herself pushed off the counter. “Wanda smells like strawberries.”</p><p>They watched her walk away before meeting each other’s gazes, silently processing this new information.</p><p>“Well, that’s certainly interesting,” Agatha commented, and Rio nodded in agreement, before grinning.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“You just said that,” Agatha reminded her, and Rio just shrugged.</p><p>“I don’t care. I love you.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head but smiled all the same. “And I suppose I love you too.”</p>
