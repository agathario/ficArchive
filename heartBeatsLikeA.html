<b>Heart Beats like a Drummer</b>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal was a rolling stone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had never stayed in one place for more than a year - maybe two, </span>
<em>
<span>tops</span>
</em>
<span>. Since she’d picked up her drumsticks at the tender age of four, tapping away at her Uncle Ludo’s old, beat-up drumset, she’d been moving. Her arms, her feet, her legs, everything. She kept moving, kept getting better at her craft, kept learning all she could about music and the people that played it, kept moving from place to place, lending her talent wherever it was wanted or needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was the most sought-after professional drummer in the music industry now, lending her drumsticks to dozens of best-selling albums all over the world. She never worked with one act on a second album, never stuck around long enough to get attached. She just kept moving, kept drumming, kept breaking hearts with her music and her charm…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was, in the opinion of most people around the world, a living legend. Her mother, Evanora Harkness, had been a well-known singer, as well, but she’d stuck mainly to church music, her songs going Platinum only amongst </span>
<em>
<span>certain</span>
</em>
<span> crowds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When her only daughter started to show musical talent, as well, it was to the surprise of nobody in their inner circle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when Agatha Harkness joined a rock band as their lead singer and guitarist, Evanora’s fans were shocked and dismayed. Agatha’s new brand of music was deemed ‘sinful’ and she was shunned from her mother’s circle. Her mother had almost immediately disowned the sixteen-year-old.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that was just fine with Agatha as her star began to rise. She wasn’t the only famous child in the band, after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice Wu Gulliver was on the keyboard, putting the talent she’d inherited from her world-renowned pop star mother, Lorna Wu, to good use. Jen Kale, her best friend since childhood, was on drums, completing their trio in their band </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span>, which took off as soon as their first album was released.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After that, it was really only a matter of time before Agatha went solo, which she did in her mid-twenties, after some spat with Jen and Alice over ‘creative differences’. Alice and Jen’s careers seemed to peter off after that; the former continued to tour with her mother, but the latter turned to skincare and social media to keep her star from waning any further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, on the other hand, became a global sensation. After leaving </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span>, she found an agent in Lilia Calderu and continued to make music and tour the world, rarely taking any breaks if she could help it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had been following her career since she was sixteen years old, still part of her own first band. Her uncle had gotten her tickets to Agatha’s first solo tour, for which Rio would always be grateful because it introduced her to…</span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had heard of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span>. She had listened to the hit songs they put out on the radio, had bobbed her head along at parties and dances, her sweaty hands wrapped around other teen girls as they spun in circles in a way that </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> have maybe counted as dancing if you squinted enough. A song or two even made it onto a playlist on her iPod when she was walking to school in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she’d never </span>
<em>
<span>truly</span>
</em>
<span> appreciated the famous trio that made up the band. The vocals were sick, she had to admit, and the drums were decent. The piano riffs were also not too shabby, but </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> was just one of those bands that you let play in the background while you do your homework.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, on the other hand. Rio remembered her uncle giving her the tickets at her sixteenth birthday dinner with a wide grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, thanks,” Rio said, looking down at the two pieces of paper. “Who’s Agatha Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s…the lead singer of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span>!” he’d huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t they break up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but Agatha went solo. These are front row seats to her first show in New York!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio said. “Cool, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>guess</span>
</em>
<span>?” Ludo grumbled. “Girl, give those back! I’m gonna take your tia. She’ll probably appreciate them, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had clutched the tickets to her chest. “I appreciate them!” she insisted. “I’m just…surprised. That’s all.” She wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug. “</span>
<em>
<span>Gracias, Tio. Te amo</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Te amo, mija,</span>
</em>
<span>” Ludo said, pressing a kiss to her temple. “So, which girl are you gonna bring with you?” He waggled his eyebrows at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girl?” Rio scoffed. “I’m bringing </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>, old man! Unless…oof, is the show past your bedtime?” She grimaced, teasingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am going to drop-kick you into next Tuesday,” he growled, wrapping his arms around her and picking Rio up as she squealed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ludo had gotten them the two best seats in the house with his connections. The stadium had been otherwise packed to the brim with former fans of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> and current fans of Agatha, all chanting her name as they waved around purple glowsticks, cheering for her as the lights began to flicker and she rose up from beneath the stage, glad in some purple, lacy, and very, </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> glittery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had been to other shows in the past. Her uncle was a famous drummer, and Rio herself was starting to make a name for herself. He’d been taking her to concerts since she was about eight, after he needled her parents into letting her accompany him to her first local rock gig. She had marveled mainly at the drummers, the way they wielded their drumsticks as they pounded out a rhythm. She had worn ear plugs to her first few concerts, her parents worried about the damage her hearing would take, but there was no way to really block out the vibrations of drums, which she swore she could feel in her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But there was also nothing like the first Agatha concert that Rio had ever attended. She was past the eardrums thing (her parents had conceded that, being their daughter was a drummer herself, the damage was far more likely to come from her own doing, anyway) and had actually let herself get excited about the concert. She’d been listening to old </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> songs in the weeks leading up to Agatha’s solo concert. Ludo had blasted Agatha’s new EP on the way from Westview to NYC, singing along to the eight songs Agatha had put out since leaving her old band behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were surprisingly good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, when Agatha had appeared on stage in that glittery purple number…well, Rio had felt weak in the knees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had always known that the lead singer of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven </span>
</em>
<span>was hot; that was </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a surprise. Every member of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> was hot, actually. But Agatha Harkness was…breathtaking. Rio may have actually forgotten how to breathe when she first saw her up on that stage, her hair wild and curly around her head, her lips painted burgundy, her eyes outlined thickly in liner, mascara, and deep purple eye shadow. Rio’s mouth had gone dry as Agatha strutted toward the front of the stage, her mic posed between long fingers, a wide, cocky grin on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good evening, New York!” she shouted, to the roar of tens of thousands of her fans. Ludo nudged her as she walked straight toward where they were standing, but Agatha wasn’t quite looking at them yet. Her gaze was still roaming over the stadium, over all the fans standing on their feet for her. “How’s everybody doing tonight?” Another roar of applause and cheers, chants of her name. “Good to hear it! Thank you all </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much for coming out to my </span>
<em>
<span>first solo show</span>
</em>
<span>! Isn’t that </span>
<em>
<span>insane</span>
</em>
<span>!?!” More cheers. “I couldn’t have asked for a better first night, though. You are all so </span>
<em>
<span>amazing</span>
</em>
<span>! Give yourselves a round of applause.” The sound was like thunder as every single person in the stadium began clapping for themselves, but Rio could barely move as transfixed as she was staring at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before we begin,” Agatha said, “I wanna let y’all in on a little secret that I’ve been </span>
<em>
<span>dying</span>
</em>
<span> to tell you for a while. It’s not super </span>
<em>
<span>huge</span>
</em>
<span> or anything. It’s just this little thing that I’ve been carrying for a while and I’d love the chance to share with you right here, right now. You ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cheers of ‘Yes, Mother’ went up around the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barked out a laugh. “</span>
<em>
<span>Mother</span>
</em>
<span>?” she echoed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Really</span>
</em>
<span>?” She shrugged. “I’ll allow it.” She gave the crowd a brilliant smile. “Okay,” she said. “Alright. So, here’s the thing.” She cleared her throat, crouching down at the front-center of the stage, just about ten feet from where Rio stood, still staring at her with wide eyes, her cheeks pink and rosy. “Y’all listening?” Cheers and murmurs and claps. “I am a woman,” Agatha started, “who enjoys the company of…other women.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the crowd of thousands of people, Rio was certain she’d have been able to hear a pin drop from a mile away from the silence that suddenly shrouded them. Agatha’s gaze roamed over the room, and Rio watched the way that her throat bobbed nervously though she kept that wide grin plastered on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, slowly, people began to clap. And then that was joined by scattered cheering. And from there it grew even louder, people going wild at Agatha’s confession. Rio’s eyes just grew wider, her jaw dropping slightly as she stared up at this woman, whom she didn’t know very well at all despite listening to her band in passing since she was a child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she was like </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. She was like </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>, a woman who liked other women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had never been in the closet for even a day. She didn’t grow up thinking that being a girl who liked other girls was weird or wrong. Her uncle was a proud bisexual man who married a proud bisexual woman. Her parents had made it a point that she was allowed to like whomever she liked, whether they were male or female. She’d walked in pride parades with her uncle and his previous boyfriends. She’d waved a flag while she sat on his shoulders. She’d held a girl’s hand in the second grade, had even introduced her to her parents as the girl she was in love with (girlfriend apparently wasn’t strong enough for how Rio had felt for her at the time), and her parents had been ecstatic, cooing over the two girls, which was the only thing that even </span>
<em>
<span>remotely</span>
</em>
<span> embarrassed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with all that, Rio hadn’t missed the lack of representation in the media of women who loved other women. She hadn’t missed the hateful rhetoric spread by people like Agatha’s own mother, who went on homophobic tirades from time to time. That was probably the main reason why Agatha hadn’t come out long ago. Or maybe she hadn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>known</span>
</em>
<span> before that liking women was an option.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No matter the reason, the fact that Agatha was standing there, in front of a crowd of tens of thousands of people, telling them what was probably her deepest, most closely-held secret, was something that Rio felt deep in her chest may have actually changed her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After that day, Rio Vidal was a die hard Agatha Harkness fan. She rose up in her career with the main goal of being the drummer for Agatha’s tour or being featured on one of her albums. Even just </span>
<em>
<span>meeting</span>
</em>
<span> the woman and getting to talk about their love for music would have been enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, she was there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was thirty-six years old, twenty years past sitting in the front row of Agatha Harkness’s first solo concert, and sitting in a recording studio, staring at a shiny new drumset. She tapped out a soft rhythm as she waited for the other band members to get there, closing her eyes as she imagined the notes of whatever song they would start with. Agatha had emailed her the music, directly, which had been their only contact since Lilia Calderu had called her, personally, to invite her on Agatha’s newest album.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had thought it was a prank, at first, and had nearly hung up the phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Agatha’s voice had joined in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal?” It was unmistakable, so clear and unique and </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> not a prank. Rio’s voice had caught in her lungs for a second. “Hey, this is Agatha Harkness. Please don’t say no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio hadn’t. She’d barely strangled out a yes, uh-huh-ing and humming as Lilia explained the terms of the contract, which she’d be happy to meet Rio and </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> agent, Sharon Davis, to talk over when she landed in New York, which would of course be covered by Agatha’s production team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could even wrap her head around what was happening, she was sitting in a room with both Lilia and Sharon, who were discussing the proposed contracts over glasses of sparkling cider and a bowl of fresh fruit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness had not been in attendance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, as Rio waited for the rest of the band to show up, she thought about the lyrics of Agatha’s latest song, </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span>, and how it might sound when everything was put together. She beat out a simple drum beat as she played the song in her head, imagining the melody as it was written on the page. Rio had noticed that there were no drum notations on the PDF she’d sent, with her own hastily scribbled chicken scratch on the page. In the body of her email, Agatha had simply written, “See what you can do with this. See you on Wednesday!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had read and re-read those notes, imagining what the bass would sound like, the guitar, the piano, Agatha’s smooth and sultry voice…but she was having trouble imagining the drums. She wouldn’t really know where to begin until they played the song once through, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds nice,” a voice said from behind her. Rio jumped and spun around on the little stool, her eyes widening at the sight of </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha Harkness standing in the doorway to the recording booth, a coffee cup in hand, and looking far too casual to be an internationally renowned superstar in yoga pants and a loose-fitting hoodie, a pair of rose-tinted sunglasses slipping down her nose, her bright blue eyes peeking over them. Her curls were tied up into a loose bun on her head, feet encased in a pair of slippers, her face completely devoid of makeup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>soft and cozy. Rio had never seen anything so enticing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a little slow though,” Agatha continued, stepping further into the room. She perched herself on the couch against the far wall, but not that far away from Rio, as she leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees, coffee cup pressed to her lips. “For the song, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice a little rough. She cleared her throat. “Yeah, um, it’s kind of hard for me to conceptualize the sound of a song that I haven’t actually heard, you know? Once I know the tempo, it should be easier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, slowly, taking a sip from her cup. “Makes sense,” she said. “So,” she said, “Ludo Vidal’s niece, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know my uncle?” Rio asked, eyes wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I went to a couple of concerts he was playing at,” she said, nodding. “Lorna Wu’s farewell tour in Denver, namely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re still friends with the Wus?” Rio asked, a bit surprised. Her beef with Jen Kale was legendary. Rio had just assumed it was the same with Alice and Lorna.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Wus and I are still close,” Agatha said, nodding. “In fact, Lorna wrote part of this song with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lorna Wu wrote part of </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio asked, eyes widening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She wrote the bridge,” Agatha confirmed. “I reached out to her for some help and she came back with absolute </span>
<em>
<span>fire</span>
</em>
<span>. I’m giving her a writing credit, of course, and we’ve struck up a deal for her to be featured on a special version of the song. She may even come on tour for a few cameos.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would be…wow,” Rio said. “To play with Lorna Wu would be…” She had been jealous when her uncle told her he was going on tour with Lorna and her band, </span>
<em>
<span>The Coral Shore</span>
</em>
<span>. He’d brought her back a bunch of signed merchandise, but she had wanted to actually </span>
<em>
<span>be there</span>
</em>
<span> on stage with the pop legend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now she might get to </span>
<em>
<span>perform</span>
</em>
<span> with her on her dream album?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pinched herself just to be sure she wasn’t dreaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is incredible,” Rio murmured, taking a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is?” Agatha asked, giving her a slightly amused smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered her for a moment, trying to decide if she should embarrass herself to keep everything close to her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was at your first concert,” Rio said, looking over at Agatha. “The first </span>
<em>
<span>solo</span>
</em>
<span> concert, I mean. In New York.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” Agatha said, nodding. “The one where I came out for the first time, publicly. I feel like most people already knew at that point, though. I was just…confirming it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had no idea,” Rio said, honestly. “I didn’t even…I wasn’t a huge fan at the time, no offense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None taken?” Agatha laughed, raising an eyebrow. “I’m curious to see where this goes, though.” She leaned forward, peering at Rio over her glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “I was sixteen at the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch,” Agatha said. “Oh, that makes me feel old.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio said, shrugging. “Point is, despite my uncle’s influence, I didn’t have amazing taste in music yet. I had a couple of </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> songs on my playlist, but I was more into music that was heavy on drums, you know? Something I could emulate. The drums weren’t a major feature on most </span>
<em>
<span>Coven</span>
</em>
<span> songs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fair,” Agatha said, with a shrug. “Proceed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But that first concert…I was front row, center, with my uncle. He’d gotten me the tickets for my birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remind me to send that man a fruit basket,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’d hate fruit,” Rio said. “Tequila is how you impress him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A man with taste,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway, you came out on stage - literally - and I just…I dunno.” She blushed, looking away. “I became a fan that day. Your music rocks. No pun intended.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha said, her voice and smile soft as she looked at Rio. “That’s always very nice to hear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was also great to see another queer girl on stage,” Rio added, blushing again as he turned back to the drums.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hear that one a lot,” Agatha said. “My fanbase is now majorly composed of queer folk of all ages. It’s…nice. To be somebody they can look up to. Lord knows </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>didn’t have that growing up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to her. “I’m sorry you didn’t,” she said, her voice soft now. “That must have sucked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>very much</span>
</em>
<span> did,” Agatha said. “Thanks.” She took another sip of her drink. “Anyway, ready to get started?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked, blinking up at Agatha as she stood up, placing her cup on a nearby table. “Don’t we have to wait on the rest of the band?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They were here yesterday,” Agatha said, walking into the booth to play with the dials and switches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked. “ Why? Where was I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably still in New Jersey?” Agatha said, with a shrug. “I have no idea. I wanted to work with you alone before everybody else got here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio asked, furrowing her brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So we could work on the drum part together,” Agatha said, grabbing a remote off the table. “This way we don’t have to drag everybody out here and wait for them to get set up every time. It slows things down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s the producer?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t need him,” Agatha retorted, holding up the remote. “Everything’s all set up. We recorded a version without drums yesterday so that you and I can practice </span>
<em>
<span>with</span>
</em>
<span> drums today. Is that alright with you? If it isn’t, I could just call Alice and Billy to come meet us. They’d be here in an hour if–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine,” Rio said, her voice cracking a bit. “It’s fine. Why wouldn’t I be alright with it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just seem…nervous,” Agatha murmured, giving her a teasing smile. “That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not nervous,” Rio lied. “Not nervous at all. It’s just…it’s just </span>
<em>
<span>drums</span>
</em>
<span>. I know drums. I can do drums.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good,” Agatha laughed. “Because that’s exactly why I want you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swore her heart stopped for a full five seconds at that though Agatha didn’t even seem to realize what she’d said as she moved to stand in front of the mic, pressing, stretching her neck out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, “my voice is recorded on this, but I’m going to sing just because.” She shrugged. “You do what feels right, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I may have to listen to it all the way through once,” she admitted, “just to get a feel for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and pressed play. The intro was long, but solid. Rio closed her eyes to listen, ghosting her drumsticks over the set without actually touching them, imagining the sounds they would make in harmony with the other instruments. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice filled the space, both live and on the recording as she sang softly with herself. Rio swallowed as the hair on the back of her neck stood up. Her drumsticks kept moving, making no sound, as she listened to the song. It had the makings of an instant classic. She started to hum along to the catchy melody as her arms moved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the song was finished, Rio opened her eyes again, a little dazed when she found Agatha looking over at her from the mic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So?” she asked. “What do you think? Got any ideas?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I have </span>
<em>
<span>plenty</span>
</em>
<span> of ideas,” Rio said. “Are we recording today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said. “Just rehearsal for right now. Alice and Billy will be here tomorrow. This is the song that they want to release before the album is announced, though, as a single. They wanna get a feel for how the album will be received. Getting everything just right is important.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “As if it’s not going to go double platinum like the last three,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>said,” Agatha huffed. “But they don’t listen to me, I guess. You ready to add a little Vidal drummer magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her grip tightening on her drumsticks. “Let’s do it,” she said, cracking her neck as she pressed her lips together in focus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could swear she heard Agatha murmur something under her breath, but it was lost under the sound of the song repeating. She ignored it, posing her drumsticks over the drums and closing her eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, she hit the drums with purpose, letting the beat in her heart spill out over them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They only need to run through the song three times. It took less than twenty minutes for Rio to be sure they had a hit on their hands. She was more sure of this than any other song she’d played a part in recording or even writing in the past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had stopped singing the last time, turning to watch Rio with wide eyes and a slightly gaping mouth as the other woman got lost in the music, making the most incredible beats that blended perfectly with her song. It was so much better than she could have ever imagined, her heart soaring as the song game to its final crescendo, Alice Wu Gulliver taking over the vocals in the end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Agatha said, letting out a deep breath. “That was…holy crap. Holy </span>
<em>
<span>crap</span>
</em>
<span>. Where have you </span>
<em>
<span>been</span>
</em>
<span> all my life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face turned an attractive shade of pink, her shoulders hunching a little as she smiled shyly down at her feet. God, she was adorable. And she couldn’t really be that shy about her talent, could she? She had directly contributed to the last </span>
<em>
<span>four</span>
</em>
<span> Grammy-winning albums in a row. She certainly knew how talented she was. Hell, she was practically drumming </span>
<em>
<span>royalty</span>
</em>
<span>, with her uncle being </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Ludo Vidal. Agatha had wanted him to feature on one of her first solo albums, but he’d had to turn her down as he’d had a full schedule. Then he’d retired before they ever got to work together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His niece, however, was already making a pretty big name for herself by then. Agatha had heard the albums she worked on, and they’d made an impression on her. She’d had Lilia call her up as soon as she was available, insistent on paying any price to get Rio Vidal to feature on her next album.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was well worth the wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve just been, you know,” Rio said, clearing her throat, “around.” She shrugged. “I take it you liked it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I let you do that </span>
<em>
<span>three</span>
</em>
<span> times,” Agatha snorted. “I </span>
<em>
<span>loved</span>
</em>
<span> it! Can you remember to do it all again tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio said. “Like I said, once I’ve played it through once, I can pretty much repeat it anytime you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Amazing,” Agatha breathed, causing another flush to spread across Rio’s cheeks. “Okay, that’s it then. Come on and let me buy you a drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out her hand to Rio, who just stared at it for a long moment, as if confused by its very existence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t bite,” Agatha snorted. “Usually,” she added with a lopsided grin. “Unless you ask </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> nicely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face went even redder at that and Agatha rolled her eyes, reaching further to tug Rio up by her arm, her hands still clutching her drumsticks as she guiding them out of the studio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha said, locking up behind them, “and when I say ‘buy you a drink’, I mean I’ve actually already bought the drinks. They’re at my place. Is that okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You…you’re inviting me to </span>
<em>
<span>your apartment</span>
</em>
<span> to drink with you?” Rio stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I actually own a brownstone,” Agatha corrected, “but yes. I </span>
<em>
<span>cannot</span>
</em>
<span> be seen in public like </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>,” she motioned to her casual clothing, “and, besides, we would be </span>
<em>
<span>swarmed</span>
</em>
<span> anywhere we go in public in this city. Or any city, actually.” She sighed. “Being famous can actually suck sometimes, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> know,” Rio said, even though she kind of did. Being a famous drummer meant that she was well-known in </span>
<em>
<span>certain</span>
</em>
<span> crowds, but she could usually blend in with the general public. “I rarely get noticed in public. Nobody pays attention to the drummer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Agatha said, flushing slightly as she cleared her throat. Rio glanced sideways at her as they made their way to the exit. “My first girlfriend was a drummer,” she said, casually, smiling softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not…Jen Kale?” Rio’s eyes were wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “</span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>, no!” Agatha said. “Her name was Sam. She had a nose ring and she played for some band called </span>
<em>
<span>The Vipers</span>
</em>
<span>. She had a snake tattoo.” She sighed, placing her hand over her heart. “I was twenty-two and </span>
<em>
<span>stupid</span>
</em>
<span> in love with her. But I was still closeted, so it didn’t work out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry to hear that,” Rio murmured, even though she was very much </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> sorry to hear that her hot new boss’s relationship hadn’t ended in a happily ever after.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably for the best, honestly,” Agatha said. “I think she’s happily married now, touring the country with her wife. I’m happy for her, but you never really forget your first, right?” She glanced at Rio as they walked to the exit. “Who was yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rosa Diaz,” Rio said. “Second grade.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Second grade</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha exclaimed. “Hey, Ty,” she fist-bumped a beefy looking bald guy as they stepped outside, still looking at Rio. “You must have been an early bloomer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I never saw it any differently to girls who had crushes on boys back then. My uncle is openly bi, you know. So is my aunt, his wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that much,” Agatha said. “Yeah, I guess growing up with queer adults in your life would give it a new perspective.” She opened the back door to a sleek black town car, bowing teasingly to Rio, who rolled her eyes and flushed, slipping into the car and sliding across the seat to give Agatha some room. Agatha slipped right in next to her, her thigh touching Rio’s. She didn’t move away, even as the car pulled out into traffic. “I obviously didn’t have that.” She held up a hand, stopping any apology that might have come from Rio’s lips. “I’m fine,” she said. “I received therapy and I got </span>
<em>
<span>plenty</span>
</em>
<span> of pussy in my twenties to make up for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face went beet red at that and Agatha let out a cackle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” she said, “was that too crass?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“N-no,” Rio stuttered, rubbing the back of her neck. “I just…wasn’t expecting that. I never thought you’d talk like…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, like a teenage fuckboy?” Agatha asked, her eyes glittering with mirth. “There’s a lot of things people don’t know about me. Like I’ve definitely got the mouth of a sailor. It kinda comes with being raised by an over-religious parent who thought ‘heck’ was too close to a swear word.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Rio said. “That’s some bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly!” Agatha laughed, leaning back against the seat and turning her body toward Rio. “You get it.” Rio smiled at her, a genuinely </span>
<em>
<span>beautiful</span>
</em>
<span> smile, and Agatha felt something flip in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had started noticing Rio before she was even recommended for Agatha’s new album, to be honest. Even before she’d been featured on her first grammy-nominated song. Rio was legendary in the industry for her talent, her drummer genes clear from a young age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had first noticed Rio when she was practically a toddler, aged twenty, as she played for </span>
<em>
<span>The Romanoffs</span>
</em>
<span>, a indie punk band that had a few hit songs in the early 2000’s. Rio had been the only brunette in the band, accompanying three blondes, but she had a drum solo that had practically knocked Agatha off her feet. She had asked Lilia about the drummer, but Lilia hadn’t been able to get her name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time she saw Natasha Romanoff, the band’s lead singer, a year later, she had asked about her drummer, who had already moved on to a new act. Agatha followed her career after that, watching Rio switch bands and genres like she was changing clothes. She’d also noticed that Rio was queer, being pictured with a few C-list celebrity musicians in bars and backstage at a few gigs, but that hadn’t been as important to her. After all, she was eight years Rio’s senior, and it had felt wrong - at the time - to see her in any romantic light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, now, Rio was in her mid-thirties, and their age difference wasn’t as much a deterrent as the fact that they were now technically work colleagues. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that Agatha had never </span>
<em>
<span>slept</span>
</em>
<span> with a work colleague. It had just never really worked out well for her when she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Third time’s the charm though, right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was clearly into her. She mirrored Agatha’s position in the seat after a moment, leaning against her own fist as they looked at each other, Rio’s cheeks still slightly pink from blushing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, her voice low and even, “you got somebody back home waiting for you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean like a girlfriend?” Rio snorted, shaking her head. “I don’t really have the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re single then.” Agatha batted her lashes at the other woman, leaning in. “Not attached to anybody? Not pining for anybody?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um,” Rio said, clearing her throat, “not exactly.” She didn’t lean away. Agatha felt her breathing start to get a little labored. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> pining for somebody, then?” she asked. “Whom, may I ask?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips together and shook her head. “I don’t think I should…” she said. Her gaze flickered to Agatha’s lips, which quirked up in a sly grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” she husked, leaning a centimeter closer. “Embarrassed? Is it </span>
<em>
<span>scandalous</span>
</em>
<span>?” She narrowed her eyes. “Is it a </span>
<em>
<span>man</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t make me puke,” Rio snorted, shaking her head slightly, her nose brushing against the tip of Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then what’s the secret?” Agatha asked, her hand sliding from her own lap to land on Rio’s thigh. She was wearing tight jeans, a little distressed at the knees. “Why won’t you tell me who it is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something tells me you already know,” Rio husked back, biting her lip as she looked into Agatha’s eyes, which were still behind those rose-colored glasses. Even through the tint, Agatha could tell that her eyes were the warmest shade of brown, like milk chocolate. They made her insides melt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanna hear you say it,” she said, her hand moving a few inches, toward the apex of Rio’s thighs, but they stopped before it became </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> risque, waiting for permission - or for the confession she hoped was coming - to continue. “Don’t be shy now, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her name on Agatha Harkness’s tongue elicited a sharp inhale and Rio felt herself lean in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s before she pulled away sharply, eyes widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” she breathed. “I shouldn’t have–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cut her off with another kiss, the hand not resting on Rio’s thigh palming the nape of her neck, pulling her forward so that their lips were pressed even more firmly together. Rio moaned against her, eyes going wide for a second or two, before closing as she angled her head to deepen the kiss, her hands cupping Agatha’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Life could literally not get any sweeter than this</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
